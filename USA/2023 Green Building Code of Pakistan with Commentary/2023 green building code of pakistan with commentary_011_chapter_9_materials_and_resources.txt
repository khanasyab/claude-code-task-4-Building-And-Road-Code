CHAPTER
8 INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (IEQ)General CommentsChapter 8 Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). Chapter 8 is intended to ensure that the building’s interior environment is conducive to the health of building occupants.This Chapter requires compliance with the mandatory provisions of Section 801.3 (§ 8.3).Section 801.3 (§ 8.3) contains mandatory provisions related to indoor environmental quality, including indoor air quality, environmental tobacco smoke control, outdoor air delivery monitoring, thermal comfort, building entrances, acoustic control, lighting quality, daylighting, and low-emitting materials.PurposeEach of the provisions in this chapter is intended to improve IEQ in buildings to ensure that the building’s interior environment is conducive to the health of building occupants.
801.1
Scope.Many external factors which affect indoor air quality are not controllable most of the time in the local context. Therefore, only limited provisions are made for these in this chapter.
801.3 (8.3) Mandatory provisionsCompliance with the mandatory provisions section is necessary for all projects, as applicable. The mandatory provisions cover indoor air quality, Section 801.3.1. “Mandatory” as used in Section 801.3 (§ 8.3) is equivalent to saying that those provisions are “common” to all projects.
801.3.1 For improving the quality of the indoor environment, the provisions are as follows.a.The indoor space should be naturally ventilated. Natural ventilation can be achieved by (1) cross ventilation, which occurs when dwellings have openings in different orientations so that breeze can flow through the room or building to flush out hot or stale air, and (2) passive ventilation, which relies on the effect of rising hot air, and requires high and low openings so that warm air is flushed from higher openings and cooler air is drawn in through lower openings. Provision for ventilation arei.Place the windows in walls facing wind direction prevalent in the summer season.ii.Install windows towards open spaces on the rear and front sides of buildings.iii.Provide patios or small open-to-sky spaces in the building plans.iv.Install ventilation duct and exhaust fan over the stove to improve internal area thermal comfort in climate zone 1. The threshold of exhaust systems whose total exhaust exceeds 5000 cubic feet per minute, or cfm, (i.e., 2400 litres/second) is 2000 cfm (950 L/s).v.A 10-foot- (3-m-) long wall-mounted canopy hood serving medium-duty appliances must exhaust no more than 2,100 cfm (990 L/s) (IgCC 2018).vi.These naturally ventilated spaces must have minimum air openings and space configuration requirements in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010.vii.ASHRAE/ANSI/ ASHE Standard 170-2013 for ventilation of health care facilities, shall be followed for ensuring Indoor Air Quality perspectives.viii.ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016 for ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality, shall be followed for ensuring Indoor Air Quality perspectives.b.There should not be any smoking zone within the building nor within 25 ft from entries and operatable windows or openings.c.Kitchen/s must have an exhaust system installed, with its vent outside to ensure removal of smoke from the building.d.The occupants of the building should have access to the controls of any kind of air conditioning, lighting or heating system in order to ensure their thermal comfort.e.Use of paints and coatings having a high content of Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, and other gases including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and radon, should be prohibited to ensure healthy indoor air.f.Composite wood and agrifiber products must contain no added urea-formaldehyde resins.g.Humidity Control shall be ensured through Indoor moisture control (primarily to reduce the likelihood of microbial growth on indoor surfaces) superseding the general reference to Standard 62.1.h.Acoustical Control compliance shall be ensured through either testing or design.i.Products of combustion from any equipment or system that is permanently installed indoors, with certain limited exceptions, be vented to the outsidej.ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2017, along-with due amendments made in ASHRAE Standard 55-2020 shall be referred to ensure designs providing acceptable thermal environmental conditions for human occupancy.This section addresses the following aspects of indoor environmental quality (IEQ): indoor air quality, environmental tobacco smoke control, outdoor air delivery monitoring, thermal comfort, building entrances, acoustic control, lighting quality, daylighting, and low-emitting materials. The minimum requirements presented here are intended to maintain occupant comfort and well-being at higher levels than those achieved by complying only with the provisions in the referenced standards. The requirements support the purpose of the GBCP-2023 to foster environmental responsibility, resource efficiency, and sustainable development.
