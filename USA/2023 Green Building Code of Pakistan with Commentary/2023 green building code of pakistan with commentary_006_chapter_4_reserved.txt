CHAPTER
3 DEFINITIONS, ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMSGENERAL COMMENTSAll terms defined for the GBCP-2023 are listed alphabetically in Chapter 3. The words or terms defined in this chapter are of prime importance in either specifying the subject matter of the code provisions or in giving meaning to certain terms used throughout the code for administrative or enforcement purposes. The code user should be familiar with the terms found in this chapter because the definitions are essential to the correct interpretation of the code and because the user might not know how a particular term found in the text is defined.PURPOSECodes, by their nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can alter a sentence’s meaning and, if misused, confuse its intent. Further, the code, with its broad scope of applicability, includes terms inherent in a variety of construction disciplines. These terms can often have multiple meanings, depending on the context or discipline in which they are being used. For these reasons, maintaining a consensus on the specific meaning of terms contained in the code is essential. Chapter 3 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purpose of the code.
301.1 (3.1)
General.Certain terms, abbreviations, and acronyms are defined in this section for the purposes of this code. These definitions are applicable to all sections of this code.Terms that are not defined herein, but that are defined in standards that are referenced herein (Informative Note: e.g., ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1), shall have the meanings as defined in those standards.Other terms that are not defined shall have their ordinarily accepted meanings within the context in which they are used. Ordinarily accepted meanings shall be based on American standard English language usage, as documented in an approved unabridged dictionary.

It has a center-of-glass visible transmittance (VT) of not less than 20%.d. The product of the center-of-glass VT and the openness factor of screens, patterned films, and ceramic frits is not less than 20%.e. Where dynamic glazing is provided, such glazing has a center-of-glass VT of not less than 20% at the highest end of its range.f. Where nonoperable opaque window treatments are provided, such as blinds, shades, and louvers, such treatments do not obstruct more than 40% of the fenestration glazing area.wall: see ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1.wall area, gross: see ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1.water, alternate on-site sources of:
alternate on-site sources of water include, but are not limited to,a. rainwater or stormwater harvesting,b. air-conditioner condensate,c. greywater from interior applications and treated as required,d. swimming-pool filter backwash water,e. cooling-tower blowdown water,f. foundation drain water,g. industrial process water, andh. on-site wastewater treatment plant effluent.water, nonpotable: water that is not potable water. (See water, potable.)water, potable: water from public drinking water systems or from natural freshwater sources, such as lakes, streams, and aquifers, where water from such natural sources would or could meet drinking water standards.water, reclaimed: nonpotable water derived from the treatment of waste water by a facility or system licensed or permitted to produce water meeting the jurisdiction’s water requirements for its intended uses, including, but not limited to, above-surface landscape irrigation.water-bottle filling station: a plumbing fixture or fixture fitting that is controlled by the user for the sole intended purpose of dispensing potable water into a personal drinking water bottle. Such fixtures and fittings are connected to the potable water distribution system of the premises and can be stand-alone fixtures or integrated with another fixture.water factor (WF): a. clothes washer (residential and commercial): the quantity of water in gallons (liters) used to wash each cubic foot (cubic meter) of machine capacity.a. residential dishwasher: the quantity of water use in gallons (liters) per full machine wash and rinse cycle.weatherproofing system: a group of components, including associated adhesives and primers, that when installed create a protective envelope against water and wind.wetlands: those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. This definition incorporates all areas that would meet the definition of “wetlands” under applicable federal or state guidance—regardless of whether they are officially designated, delineated, or mapped—including man-made areas that are designed, constructed, or restored to include the ecological functions of natural wetlands.
