APPENDIX CGELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTUREThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix:
Appendix CG can be adopted by authorities having jurisdiction seeking electric vehicle charging infrastructure requirements.
SECTION
CG101—ELECTRIC VEHICLE POWER TRANSFER
CG101.1
Definitions.AUTOMOBILE PARKING SPACE. A space within a building or private or public parking lot, exclusive of driveways, ramps, columns,office and work areas, for the parking of an automobile.ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV). An automotive-type vehicle for on-road use, such as passenger automobiles, buses, trucks, vans, neighborhood electric vehicles and electric motorcycles, primarily powered by an electric motor that draws current from a building electrical service, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), a rechargeable storage battery, a fuel cell, a photovoltaic array or another source of electric current.ELECTRIC VEHICLE CAPABLE SPACE (EV CAPABLE SPACE). A designated automobile parking space that is provided with electricalinfrastructure such as, but not limited to, raceways, cables, electrical capacity, a panelboard or other electrical distribution equipment space necessary for the future installation of an EVSEELECTRIC VEHICLE READY SPACE (EV READY SPACE). An automobile parking space that is provided with a branch circuit and anoutlet, junction box or receptacle that will support an installed EVSEELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT (EVSE). Equipment for plug-in power transfer, including ungrounded, grounded and equipment grounding conductors; electric vehicle connectors; attached plugs; any personal protection system; and all other fittings, devices, power outlets or apparatus installed specifically for the purpose of transferring energy between the premises wiring and the electric vehicle.ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED SPACE (EVSE SPACE). An automobile parking space that is provided with adedicated EVSE connection.
CG101.2
Electric vehicle power transfer infrastructure.Parking facilities shall be provided with electric vehicle power transfer infrastructure in accordance with Sections CG101.2.1 through CG101.2.6.
CG101.2.1
Quantity.The number of required electric vehicle (EV) spaces, EV capable spaces and EV ready spaces shall be determined in accordance with this section and Table CG101.2.1 based on the total number of automobile parking spaces and shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. For Group R-2 buildings, the Table CG101.2.1 requirements shall be based on the total number of dwelling units or the total number of automobile parking spaces, whichever is less.1. Where more than one parking facility is provided on a building site, the number of required automobile parking spaces required to have EV power transfer infrastructure shall be calculated separately for each parking facility.2. Where one shared parking facility serves multiple building occupancies, the required number of spaces shall be determined proportionally based on the floor area of each building occupancy.3. Installed electric vehicle supply equipment installed spaces (EVSE spaces) that exceed the minimum requirements of this section may be used to meet the minimum requirements for EV ready spaces and EV capable spaces.4. Installed EV ready spaces that exceed the minimum requirements of this section may be used to meet the minimum requirements for EV capable spaces.5. Where the number of EV ready spaces allocated for R-2 occupancies is equal to the number of dwelling units or to the number of automobile parking spaces allocated to R-2 occupancies, whichever is less, requirements for EVSE spaces for R-2 occupancies shall not apply.6. Requirements for a Group S-2 parking garage shall be determined by the occupancies served by that parking garage. Where new automobile spaces do not serve specific occupancies, the values for Group S-2 parking garage in Table CG101.2.1 shall be used.Exception: Parking facilities serving occupancies other than R2 with fewer than 10 automobile parking spaces.
