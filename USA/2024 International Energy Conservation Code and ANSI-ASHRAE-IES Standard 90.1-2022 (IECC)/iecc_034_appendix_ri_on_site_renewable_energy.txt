APPENDIX RH OPERATIONAL CARBON RATING AND ENERGY REPORTINGThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: This appendix provides a means to evaluate a building’s greenhouse gas performance determined in accordance with ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301.
SECTION RH101—GENERAL DEFINITIONS CO2e INDEX.A numerical integer value, calculated in accordance with ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301, that represents the relative Carbon Dioxide equivalence (CO2e) emissions of a rated design as compared with the CO2e emissions of the CO2e reference design, where an Index value of 100 represents the CO2e performance of the CO2e reference design and an Index value of 0 (zero) represents a home that emits zero net CO2e annually.
SECTION RH102—COMPLIANCE
RH102.1 Application (replaces Section R401.2). Residential buildings shall comply with Section R406.Exception: Additions, alterations, repairs and changes of occupancy to existing buildings complying with Chapter 5.
RH102.2 Certificate (replaces Section R401.3). A permanent certificate shall be completed by the builder or other approved party and posted on a wall in the space where the furnace is located, a utility room or an approved location inside the building. Where located on an electrical panel, the certificate shall not cover or obstruct the visibility of the circuit directory label, service disconnect label or other required labels. The certificate shall indicate the following:1. The predominant R-values of insulation installed in or on ceilings, roofs, walls, foundation components such as slabs, basement walls, crawl space walls and floors and ducts outside conditioned spaces.2. U-factors of fenestration and the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of fenestration. Where there is more than one value for any component of the building thermal envelope, the certificate shall indicate both the value covering the largest area and the area weighted average value if available.3. The results from any required duct system and building thermal envelope air leakage testing performed on the building.4. The types, sizes and efficiencies of heating, cooling and service water-heating equipment. Where a gas-fired unvented room heater, electric furnace or baseboard electric heater is installed in the residence, the certificate shall indicate “gas-fired unvented room heater,” “electric furnace” or “baseboard electric heater,” as appropriate. An efficiency is not required to be indicated for gas-fired unvented room heaters, electric furnaces or electric baseboard heaters.5. Where on-site photovoltaic panel systems have been installed, the array capacity, inverter efficiency, panel tilt and orientation shall be noted on the certificate.6. For buildings where an Energy Rating Index score is determined in accordance with Section R406, the Energy Rating Index score and CO2e Index, both with and without any on-site generation, shall be listed on the certificate.7. The code edition under which the structure was permitted.8. Where a solar-ready zone is provided, the certificate shall indicate the location and dimensions.
RH102.3 ERI and CO2e Index compliance (replaces Section R406.2). Compliance based on the ERI and CO2e Index requires that the rated design and as-built dwelling unit meet all of the following:1. The requirements of the sections indicated in Table R406.2.2. Maximum ERI values indicated in Table R406.5.3. For all-electric dwelling units, maximum CO2e Index of 65, not including OPP, determined in accordance with ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301. For mixed-fuel dwelling units, a maximum CO2e Index established at the time of adoption of this appendix by the authority having jurisdiction based on the CO2e emissions data specific to the jurisdiction.
RH102.4 Confirmed compliance report for a certificate of occupancy (replaces Section R406.7.2.2).A confirmed compliance report submitted for obtaining the certificate of occupancy shall be made site and address specific and include the following:1. Building street address or other building site identification.2. Declaration of ERI and CO2e Index on title page and on building plans.3. The name of the individual performing the analysis and generating the report.4. The name and version of the compliance software tool.5. Documentation of all inputs entered into the software used to produce the results for the ERI reference design and the asbuilt dwelling unit.6. A final confirmed certificate indicating that the as-built building has been verified to comply with Sections R406.2, R406.4 and R406.5. The certificate shall report the energy features that were confirmed to be in the building, including component level insulation R-values or U-factors; results from any required duct system and building thermal envelope air leakage testing; and the type and rated efficiencies of the heating, cooling, mechanical ventilation and service water-heating equipment installed. The certificate shall report the estimated dwelling unit energy use by fuel type, inclusive of all end uses. Where onsite renewable energy systems have been installed on or in the building, the certificate shall report the type and production size of the installed system.
