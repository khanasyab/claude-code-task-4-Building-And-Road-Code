APPENDIX RG 2024 IECC STRETCH CODEThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: This appendix provides requirements for residential buildings intended to result in lower energy consumption compared to adoption of the residential provisions of this code. Where adopted by ordinance as a requirement, Section RG101.1 language is intended to replace Section R405.2, Section RG101.2 language is intended to replace Section R406.5, and Section RG101.3 language is intended to replace Section R408.2. Where those sections of the code have been amended for other purposes, this appendix is only intended to increase the number of credits required in the Prescriptive path, to increase the energy cost savings in the Simulated Performance path, and to lower the maximum ERI in the ERI path.ICC Council Policy-49 Note: This voluntary appendix is intended for adopting authorities that wish to extend beyond the mandatory provisions of this code toward Zero Net Energy goals. For jurisdictions in the United States, compliance options appear to be available but may be limited in Climate Zones 0-3 if using only minimum efficiency mechanical and service water heating equipment. Adopting authorities may need to consider alternative means to expand methods for compliance under these conditions (see Section R104.1).
SECTION RG101—COMPLIANCE
RG101.1 (R405.2) Simulated building performance compliance.Compliance based on simulated building performance requires that a building comply with the following:1. The requirements of the sections indicated within Table R405.2.2. The proposed total building thermal envelope thermal conductance, TC, shall be less than or equal to the building thermal envelope TC using the prescriptive U-factors and F-factors from Table R402.1.2 multiplied by 1.08 in Climate Zones 0, 1 and 2, and 1.15 in Climate Zones 3 through 8 in accordance with Equation 4-2 and Section R402.1.5. The area-weighted maximum fenestration SHGC permitted in Climate Zones 0 through 3 shall be 0.30.3. For each dwelling unit with one or more fuel-burning appliances for space heating, water heating, or both, the annual energy cost of the dwelling unit shall be less than or equal to 70 percent of the annual energy cost of the standard reference design. For all other dwelling units, the annual energy cost of the dwelling unit shall be less than or equal to 75 percent of the annual energy cost of the standard reference design. For each dwelling unit with greater than 5,000 square feet (465 m2) of living space located above grade plane, the annual energy cost of the dwelling unit shall be reduced by an additional 5 percent of annual energy cost of the standard reference design. Energy prices shall be taken from an approved source, such as the US Energy Information Administration’s state energy data system prices and expenditures reports. Code officials shall be permitted to require time-of-use pricing in energy cost calculations.Exceptions:1. The energy use based on source energy expressed in Btu or Btu per square foot of conditioned floor area shall be permitted to be substituted for the energy cost. The source energy multiplier for electricity shall be 2.51. The source energy multiplier for fuels other than electricity shall be 1.09.2. The energy use based on site energy expressed in Btu or Btu per square foot of conditioned floor area shall be permitted to be substituted for the energy cost.
RG101.2 (R406.5) ERI-based compliance.Compliance based on an Energy Rating Index (ERI) analysis requires that the rated design and each confirmed as-built dwelling unit be shown to have an ERI less than or equal to the applicable value indicated in Table RG101.2 where compared to the ERI reference design as follows:1. Where on-site renewables are not installed, the maximum ENERGY RATING INDEX NOT INCLUDING OPP applies.2. Where on-site renewables are installed, the maximum ENERGY RATING INDEX WITH OPP applies.Exceptions:1. Where the ERI analysis excludes on-site power production (OPP), the maximum ENERGY RATING INDEX NOT INCLUDING OPP shall be permitted.2. For buildings with 20 or more dwelling units, where approved by the code official, compliance shall be permitted using the Average Dwelling Unit Energy Rating Index, as calculated in accordance with ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301

RG101.3 (R408.2)
Additional energy efficiency credit requirements. Residential buildings shall earn not less than 20 credits from not less than two measures specified in Table R408.2. Five additional credits shall be earned for dwelling units with more than 5,000 square feet (465 m2) of living space located above grade plane. To earn credit as specified in Table R408.2 for the applicable climate zone, each measure selected for compliance shall comply with the applicable subsections of Section R408. Each dwelling unit or sleeping unit shall comply with the selected measure to earn credit. Interpolation of credits between measures shall not be permitted.
