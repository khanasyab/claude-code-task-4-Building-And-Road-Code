APPENDIX RL RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTUREThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: This appendix provides readiness requirements for renewable energy infrastructure.
SECTION
RL101—RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE
RL101.1 Renewable energy infrastructure.The building shall comply with the requirements of Section RL101.1.1 or RL101.1.2.
RL101.1.1 One- and two-family dwellings and townhouses.One- and two-family dwellings and townhouses shall comply withSections RL101.1.1.1 through RL101.1.1.4.Exceptions: 1. A dwelling unit with a permanently installed on-site renewable energy system.2. A dwelling unit with a solar-ready zone area that is less than 500 square feet (46 m2) of roof area oriented between 110 degrees (1.92 rad) and 270 (4.71 rad) degrees of true north.3. A dwelling unit with less than 500 square feet (46 m2) of roof area oriented between 110 degrees and 270 degrees of true north.4. Dwelling units where 50 percent of the solar-ready zone area is shaded from direct-beam sunlight by natural objects or by structures that are not part of the building for more than 2,500 annual hours between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.5. A dwelling unit that complies with Appendix RC.6. A dwelling unit with a renewable energy power purchase agreement with a duration of not less than 15 years from a utility or a community renewable energy facility and for not less than 80 percent of the estimated dwelling unit wholebuilding electric use on an annual basis.7. A dwelling unit with less than or equal to 1,500 square feet (139 m2) of living space located above grade plane.
RL101.1.1.1 Solar-ready zone area.The total area of the solar-ready zone shall not be less than 250 square feet (23.2 m2) and shall be composed of areas not less than 5.5 feet (1676 mm) in one direction and not less than 80 square feet (7.4 m2) exclusive of access or set back areas as required by the International Residential Code.Exception: Dwelling units in townhouses three stories or less in height above grade plane and with a total floor area less than or equal to 2,000 square feet (186 m2) per dwelling shall be permitted to have a solar-ready zone area of not less than 150 square feet (14 m2).
RL101.1.1.2 Obstructions.Solar-ready zones shall be free from obstructions, including but not limited to vents, chimneys and roofmounted equipment.
RL101.1.1.3 Electrical service reserved space.The main electrical service panel shall have a reserved space for a dual-pole circuit breaker and shall be labeled “For Future Renewable Electric.” The reserved space shall be at the opposite (load) end of the busbar from the primary energy source.
RL101.1.1.4 Electrical interconnection.An electrical junction box shall be installed within 24 inches (610 mm) of the main electrical service panel and shall be connected to a capped roof penetration sleeve or a location in the attic that is within 3 feet (914 mm) of the solar-ready zone by a nonflexible metallic conduit not less than 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter or by permanently installed wire as approved. Where the interconnection terminates in the attic, the location shall be not less than 12 inches (35 mm) above ceiling insulation. Both ends of the interconnection shall be labeled “For Future Renewable Electric.”
RL101.1.2 Group R occupancies.Residential buildings other than one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses shall comply with Sections RL101.1.2.1 through RL101.1.2.8.
RL101.1.2.1 General.A solar-ready zone shall be located on the roof of residential buildings that are oriented between 110 degrees and 270 degrees of true north or have low slope roofs. Solar-ready zones shall comply with Sections RL101.1.2.2 through RL101.1.2.8.Exceptions: 1. A building with a permanently installed on-site renewable energy system.2. A building with a solar-ready zone area that is shaded for more than 70 percent of daylight hours annually.3. A building where an approved party certifies that the incident solar radiation available to the building is not suitable for a solar-ready zone.4. A building where an approved party certifies that the solar-ready zone area required by Section RL101.1.2.3 cannot be met because of rooftop equipment, skylights, vegetative roof areas or other obstructions.5. A building that complies with Appendix RC.6. A building with a renewable energy power purchase agreement with a duration of not less than 15 years from a utility or a community renewable energy facility and for not less than 80 percent of the estimated electric use of the residential occupancy portion of the building on an annual basis.
RL101.1.2.2 Construction document requirements for a solar-ready zone.Construction documents shall indicate the solar-ready zone.
RL101.1.2.3 Solar-ready zone area.The total solar-ready zone area shall be not less than 40 percent of the roof area calculated as the horizontally projected gross roof area less the area covered by penthouses, mechanical equipment, rooftop structures, skylights, occupied roof decks, vegetative roof areas and mandatory access or set back areas as required by the International Fire Code. The solar-ready zone shall be a single area or smaller, separated sub-zone areas. Each sub-zone shall be not less than 5 feet (1524 mm) in width in the narrowest dimension.
RL101.1.2.4 Obstructions.Solar-ready zones shall be free from obstructions, including pipes, vents, ducts, HVAC equipment, skylights and roof-mounted equipment.
RL101.1.2.5 Roof loads and documentation.A collateral dead load of not less than 5 pounds per square foot (24.41 kg/m2) shall be included in the gravity and lateral design calculations for the solar-ready zone. The structural design loads for roof dead load and roof live load shall be indicated on the construction documents.
RL101.1.2.6 Interconnection pathway.Construction documents shall indicate pathways for routing of conduit or plumbing from the solar-ready zone to the electrical service panel or service hot water system.
RL101.1.2.7 Electrical service reserved space.The main electrical service panel shall have a reserved space to allow installation of a dual-pole circuit breaker for future solar electric and shall be labeled “For Future Renewable Electric.” The reserved spaces shall be positioned at the end of the panel that is opposite from the panel supply conductor connection.
RL101.1.2.8 Construction documentation certificate.A permanent certificate, indicating the solar-ready zone and other requirements of this section, shall be posted near the electrical distribution panel, water heater or other conspicuous location.
