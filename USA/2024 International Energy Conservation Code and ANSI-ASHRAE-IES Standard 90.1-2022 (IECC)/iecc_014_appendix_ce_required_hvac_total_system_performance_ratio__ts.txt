APPENDIX CDTHE 2030 GLIDE PATHThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: This voluntary appendix is suited for adopting authorities that wish to extend beyond the mandatory provisions of this code toward zero net energy goals. Appendix CD is intended to be adopted by jurisdictions that will require new construction to operate at zero net energy by the year 2030. It reduces the net annual energy use of buildings by approximately one-third in comparison with buildings constructed in compliance with the 2021 IECC. It is assumed that the 2027 and 2030 editions will also reduce energy use by one-third each.
SECTION
CD101—COMPLIANCE
CD101.1 Reserved.
CD101.2
Simulated Building Performance compliance.Where compliance is demonstrated using the Simulated Building Performance option of Section C401.2.1, the percentage of annual energy cost (PAEC), applied to the standard reference design referenced in Equation 4-34, shall be multiplied by 0.97.
CD101.3
On-site renewable electricity systems.In addition to any renewable energy generation equipment provided to comply with Section C406.3, buildings shall install equipment for on-site renewable energy generation with a direct current (DC) nameplate capacity rating of not less than that computed using Equation CD-2.Equation CD-1where:AA = Adjusted area, in ft2 (m2).CA = Conditioned area, in ft2 (m2).SNA = Semi-heated and nonconditioned area, in ft2 (m2).Equation CD-2where:REQ = Required on-site capacity, in DC watts.AA = Adjusted area from Equation CD-1, in ft2 (m2).CF = Capacity factor from Table CD101.3, in watts/ft2 (m2).Exceptions: 1. Any required renewable energy generation capacity in excess of 10 watts per square foot (108 W/m2) of net available roof area is permitted to be provided using an off-site renewable energy system in accordance with Section CD101.4. For the purposes of this section, net available roof area is the gross roof area minus the roof area occupied by any combination of skylights, mechanical equipment, vegetated areas, required access pathways, vehicle parking and occupied roof terrace area.2. The following buildings are permitted to provide off-site renewable energy generation in accordance with Section CD101.4 in lieu of all or part of the on-site renewable energy generation capacity required by Section CD101.3:2.1. Any building where more than 50 percent of roof area would be shaded from direct-beam sunlight by existing natural objects or by structures that are not part of the building for more than 2,500 annual hours between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.2.2. Any building with gross conditioned floor area less than 1,000 square feet (93 m2).2.3. Any building whose primary roof slope is 2 units vertical in 12 units horizontal (17 percent slope) or greater.3. Alternate forms of renewable energy generation capacity are permitted where the annual energy generation is not less than that produced by the required solar capacity, and where annual energy generation is calculated using an approved methodology.4. All or part of the required renewable energy generation capacity is permitted to be replaced by other efficiency measures provided that such measures will reduce the annual energy consumption of the building by an amount no less than that which would otherwise be produced annually by the required renewable energy capacity, as calculated using the Simulated Building Performance compliance path in Section C407 and an approved calculation methodology for solar production.
TABLE CD101.3—ON-SITE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY
CLIMATE ZONE CAPACITY FACTOR
1A, 2B, 3B, 3C, 4B and 5B 2.0 W/ft2
0A, 0B, 1B, 2A, 3A and 6B 2.3 W/ft2
4A, 4C, 5A, 5C, 6A, 7 and 8 2.6 W/ft2
For SI: 1 watt per square foot = 10.76 W/m2.
CD101.4
Off-site renewable energy.Buildings that qualify for one or more of the exceptions to Section CD101.3 and that do not have on-site renewable energy systems sufficiently sized to fully comply with Section CD101.3 shall procure off-site renewable energy in accordance with Sections CD101.4.1 through CD101.4.3. Such procured energy shall provide not less than the total annual required off-site renewable energy determined in accordance with Equation CD-4 and shall be provided in addition to any renewable energy provided to comply with Section C406.3.Equation CD-3where:DEF = Renewable capacity deficit, in DC watts.REQ = Required on-site capacity in DC watts, from Equation CD-2.INSTL = Installed on-site capacity, in DC watts.Equation CD-4where:OFF = Off-site renewable energy to be procured, in kWh/year.
CD101.4.1
Off-site procurement.The building owner shall procure and be credited for the total amount of off-site renewable energy required by Equation CD-4. Procured off-site renewable energy shall comply with the requirements applicable to not less than one of the following:1. Community renewables energy facility.2. Financial renewable energy power purchase agreement.3. Physical renewable energy power purchase agreement.4. Direct ownership.5. Renewable Energy Investment Fund.6. Green retail tariff.
CD101.4.2
Off-site contract.The renewable energy shall be delivered or credited to the building site under an energy contract with a duration of not less than 10 years. The contract shall be structured to survive a partial or full transfer of ownership of the building property. The total required off-site renewable energy shall be procured in equal installments over the duration of the off-site contract.
CD101.4.3
Renewable energy certificate (REC) documentation.The property owner or owner’s authorized agent shall demonstrate that where RECs are associated with on-site and off-site renewable energy production required by Sections CD101.3 and CD101.4, the following criteria shall be met:1. The RECs shall be retained and retired by or on behalf of the property owner or tenant for a period of not less than 10 years or the duration of the contract in Section CD101.4.2, whichever is less.2. The RECs shall be created within a 12-month period of the use of the REC.3. The RECs represent a generating asset constructed not more than 5 years before the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
