APPENDIX CEREQUIRED HVAC TOTAL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE RATIO (TSPR)The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: Appendix CE can be adopted for stretch codes and utility incentive certification that requires Total System Performance Ratio (TSPR) analysis where it is applicable and requires a higher level of performance, saving 5 percent versus minimum efficiency systems.
SECTION
CE101—GENERAL
CE101.1
Required HVAC total system performance ratio (TSPR).For jurisdictions that wish to adopt a stretch code or HVAC incentive system, make the following changes to Section C403.
CE101.2
(Replace Section C403.1 with the following) General.Mechanical systems and equipment serving the building heating, cooling, ventilating or refrigerating needs shall comply with one of the following:1. Sections C403.1.1 and C403.2 through C403.17 and where applicable, Section C409.2. Data centers shall comply with Sections C403.1.1, C403.1.2 and C403.6 through C403.17.
CE101.3
HVAC total system performance ratio (TSPR). (Add the following three exceptions to Section C409.2.)Exceptions: 1. Buildings with conditioned floor area less than 5,000 square feet (465 m2).2. Alterations to existing buildings that do not substantially replace the entire HVAC system and are not serving initial buildout construction.3. HVAC systems meeting or exceeding all the requirements of the applicable target design HVAC system described in Tables C409.7(1) through C409.7(3).
