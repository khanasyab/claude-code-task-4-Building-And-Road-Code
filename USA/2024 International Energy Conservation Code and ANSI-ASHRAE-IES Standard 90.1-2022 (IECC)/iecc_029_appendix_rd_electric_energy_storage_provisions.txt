APPENDIX RC ZERO NET ENERGY RESIDENTIAL BUILDING PROVISIONSThe provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.User notes:About this appendix: This appendix provides requirements for residential buildings intended to result in zero net energy consumption over the course of a year. Where adopted by ordinance as a requirement, Sections RC101.1, RC101.2, RC103.2, RC103.4 and RC103.5 are intended to replace Sections R401.1, R401.2, R406.2, R406.4 and R406.5, respectively. Where adopted by ordinance as a requirement, Sections R401.3 (Certificate), R406.1 (Scope), R406.3 (Building thermal envelope), R406.6 (Verification by approved agency) and R406.7 (Documentation) are not replaced.
SECTION RC101—GENERAL
RC101.1 Scope. This appendix applies to new residential buildings.
RC101.2 Application. Residential buildings shall comply with Section R406.Exception: Additions, alterations, repairs and changes of occupancy to existing buildings complying with Chapter 5.
RC101.3 Certificate. (No change, same as Section R401.3.)
SECTION RC102—GENERAL DEFINITIONS COMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITY (CREF). A facility that produces energy from renewable energy resources and that is qualified as a community energy facility under applicable jurisdictional statutes and rules.FINANCIAL RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (FPPA).A financial arrangement between a renewable electricity generator and a purchaser wherein the purchaser pays or guarantees a price to the generator for the project’s renewable generation. Also known as a financial power purchase agreement and virtual power purchase agreement.PHYSICAL RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (PPPA).A contract for the purchase of renewable electricity froma specific renewable electricity generator by a purchaser of renewable electricity.
SECTION RC103—ZERO NET ENERGY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
RC103.1 Scope. (No change, same as Section R406.1.)
RC103.2 ERI compliance. Compliance based on the ERI requires that the rated design meets one of the following:1. The requirements of the sections indicated within Table R406.2 and Sections R406.3 through R406.7, or2. The requirements of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.2, including:2.1. The ERI requirements of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.2 Table 6-1 without the use of on-site power production (OPP).2.2. The requirements of Sections R402.5.1.1, R402.5.1.2, and R406.3.2.3. The maximum ERI including adjusted OPP of Table RC103.5 determined in accordance with Section RC103.4.
RC103.3 Building thermal envelope.(No change, same as Section R406.3.)
RC103.4 Energy Rating Index.The Energy Rating Index (ERI) not including renewable energy resources shall be determined in accordance with ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301. The ERI including renewable energy resources shall be determined in accordance withANSI/RESNET/ICC 301, except where electrical energy is provided from a community renewable energy facility (CREF) or contractedfrom a physical or financial renewable energy power purchase agreement that meets requirements of Section RC103.4.1, on-sitepower production (OPP) shall be adjusted in accordance with Equation RC-1.Equation RC-1where: OPPkWh
=
Annual electrical energy from on-site renewable energy, in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh).
CREFkWh
=
Annual electrical energy from a community renewable energy facility (CREF), in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). PPPAkWh
=
Where not included as OPP, the annual electrical energy contracted from a physical renewable energy powerpurchase agreement, in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh).
FPPAkWh
=
Where not included as OPP, the annual electrical energy contracted from a financial renewable energy power purchase agreement (FPPA), in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh).
RC103.4.1
Renewable energy contract.The renewable energy shall be delivered or credited to the building site under an energy contract with a duration of not less than 15 years. The contract shall be structured to survive a partial or full transfer of ownership of the building property.
RC103.5
ERI-based compliance. Compliance based on an ERI analysis requires that the rated design and confirmed built dwelling be shown to have an ERI less than or equal to both values indicated in Table RC103.5 when compared to the ERI reference design.
