CHAPTER 3 OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION AND USEUser note:About this chapter: Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into use groups and occupancies. Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety requirements, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes.
SECTION
301 SCOPE
301.1 General.The provisions of this chapter shall control the classification of all buildings and structures as to occupancy and use. Different classifications of occupancy and use represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occupants and adjacent properties.
SECTION
302 OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION AND USE DESIGNATION
302.1 Occupancy classification.Occupancy classification is the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building, structure or portion thereof. Structures shall be classified into one or more of the occupancy groups specified in this section based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occupants generally associated with the intended purpose of the building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall comply with all applicable requirements associated with such potential multipurpose. Structures containing multiple occupancy groups shall comply with Section 508. Where a structure is proposed for a purpose that is not specified in this section, such structure shall be classified in the occupancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Section 503.1.4.1.AssemblySection 303Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5.2.BusinessSection 304Group B.3.EducationalSection 305Group E.4.Factory and IndustrialSection 306Groups F-1 and F-2.5.High HazardSection 307Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5.6.InstitutionalSection 308Groups 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4.7.MercantileSection 309Group M.8.ResidentialSection 310Groups R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4.9.StorageSection 311Groups S-1 and S-2.10.Utility and MiscellaneousSection 312Group U.
302.2 Use designation.Occupancy groups contain subordinate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occupants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional designations specified within the occupancy group descriptions in Section 302.1. Certain uses require specific limitations and controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this code.
