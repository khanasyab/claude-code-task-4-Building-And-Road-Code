Peak ground acceleration shall be determined based on one of the following:2.1.A site-specific study in accordance with Chapter 21 of ASCE 7.2.2.In accordance with Section 11.8.3 of ASCE 7.3.An assessment of potential consequences of liquefaction and soil strength loss including, but not limited to, the following:3.1.Estimation of total and differential settlement.3.2.Lateral soil movement.3.3.Lateral soil loads on foundations.3.4.Reduction in foundation soil-bearing capacity and lateral soil reaction.3.5.Soil downdrag and reduction in axial and lateral soil reaction for pile foundations.3.6.Increases in soil lateral pressures on retaining walls.3.7.Flotation of buried structures.4.Discussion of mitigation measures such as, but not limited to, the following:4.1.Selection of appropriate foundation type and depths.4.2.Selection of appropriate structural systems to accommodate anticipated displacements and forces.4.3.Ground stabilization.4.4.Any combination of these measures and how they shall be considered in the design of the structure.
1803.5.13 Site Specific Ground Motion Response Analysis.A site specific ground motion response analysis shallbe performed in the following situations:1.The facility is identified as critical or essential;2.A more accurate assessment of hazard level is desired;3.If the site is located within 6 miles of a known active fault capable of producing a magnitude 5 or greater earthquake and near fault effects are not adequately modeled in the development of ground motion maps used;4.
Sites where geologic conditions are likely to result in un-conservative spectral acceleration values if the generalized code response spectra is used (e.g., within the upper 100 ft. a sharp change in impedance between subsurface strata is present, etc.); or5.
There may be other reasons why the general procedure cannot be used, such as the situation where the spectral acceleration coefficient at 1.0 second is greater than the spectral acceleration coefficient at 0.2 second. In such cases, a site specific ground motion analysis should be conducted;6.
Information about one or more active seismic sources for the site has become available since the information available in the Code and new seismic source information may result in a significant change of the seismic hazard at the site.If a site specific ground motion response analysis is conducted, field measurements of the shear wave velocity (V) should be obtained through down hole testing as per ASTM D7400-8.If a site specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is conducted, it shall be conducted in a manner togenerate a uniform-hazard acceleration response spectrum considering a 7 percent probability of exceedance in 75years for spectral values over the entire period range of interest. This analysis shall follow the same basic approach asused by the USGS in developing seismic hazards maps. In this approach it is necessary to establish the following:1.
The contributing seismic sources;2.
A magnitude fault-rupture-length or source area relation for each contributing fault or source area to estimate an upper-bound earthquake magnitude for each source zone;3.
Median ground motion attenuation equations for acceleration response spectral values and their associated standard deviations;4.
A magnitude-recurrence relation for each source zone; and5.
Weighting factors, with justification, for all branches oflogic trees used to establish ground shaking hazards.In regions of known active faults, site-specific ground motion hazard levels should be based on a deterministic seismichazard analysis (OSHA), provided that deterministic spectrum is no less than two-thirds of the probabilistic spectrum,(see AASHTO Article 3.10.2.2). This requires that:1.
The ground motion hazard at a particular site is largely from known faults (e.g., “random” seismicity is not a significant contributor to the hazard), and2.
The recurrence interval for large earthquakes on the known faults are generally less than the return period corresponding to the specified seismic hazard level (e.g., the earthquake recurrence interval is less than a return period of 1,000 years that corresponds to a seismic hazard level of 7 percent probability of exceedance in 75years).The goal of the site characterization for seismic design is to develop the subsurface profile and soil propertyinformation needed for seismic analyses. Soil parameters generally required for seismic design include:1.
Dynamic shear modulus at small strains or shear wave velocity (ASTM D7400-8); Shear modulus and material damping characteristics as a function of shear strain; (ASTM D 4015 Standard Test Methods for Modulus and Damping of Soils by Fixed-Base Resonant Column Devices);2.
Cyclic and post-cyclic shear strength parameters (peak and residual) (ASTM D 5311-92);3.
Consolidation parameters such as the Compression Index or Percent Volumetric Strain resulting from pore pressure dissipation after cyclic loading, (ASTM D 5311-92); and4.
Liquefaction resistance parameters. (ASTM D 5311. Standard test method for load controlled cyclic triaxial strength of soil).
1803.5.13.1 Peer review.Site specific hazard analysis shall be approved by AHJ with the help of independent experts(registered design professionals) in site specific seismic hazard analyses.
1803.6 Reporting.Where geotechnical investigations are required, a written report of the investigations shall be submitted to the AHJ by the permit applicant at the time of permit application. This geotechnical report shall include, but need not be limited to, the following information:1.A plot showing the location of the soil investigations.2.A complete record of the soil boring and penetration test logs and soil samples.3.A record of the soil profile.4.Elevation of the water table, if encountered.5.Recommendations for foundation type and design criteria, including but not limited to: bearing capacity of natural or compacted soil; provisions to mitigate the effects of expansive soils; mitigation of the effects of liquefaction, differential settlement and varying soil strength; and the effects of adjacent loads.6.Expected total and differential settlement.7.Deep foundation information in accordance with Section 1803.5.5.8.Special design and construction provisions for foundations of structures founded on expansive soils, as necessary.9.Compacted fill material properties and testing in accordance with Section 1803.5.8.10.Controlled low-strength material properties and testing in accordance with Section 1803.5.9.
