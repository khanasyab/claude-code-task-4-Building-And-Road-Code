PREFACEPakistan Engineering Council (PEC) is a Statutory Regulatory Body established under PEC Act 1976 regulating the Engineering Profession and Education across Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan has mandated PEC to act as a national “Think Tank” and provide necessary assistance to the Federal Government on various national policies, development plans, engineering disciplines and development of codes & standards. Similarly, PEC with the extended technical assistance of reputed national and international organizations has successfully developed the following Codes:- Building Code of Pakistan (2021)- Building Code of Pakistan - Seismic Provisions (2007)- Building Code of Pakistan - Energy Provisions (2011)- Pakistan Electric and Telecommunication Safety Code (2014)- Building Code of Pakistan - Fire Safety Provisions (2016)Pakistan lies on a seismic junction of three major tectonic plates of the world including Eurasian, Indian and Arabian. The devastating Earthquake of October, 2005 resulted in 87,000 casualties, 780,000 buildings were destroyed and 2.5 million people became homeless with economic loss around US $2.3 billion. During that depth of difficulty and national disaster, PEC took one step further and constituted a high profile Task Force comprising of eminent experts from academia, industry, Ministry of Housing & Works, Ministry of Science and Technology, National Engineering Services Pakistan (NESPAK) along with allied stakeholders, partner organizations and the never ending assistance provided by the International Code Council (ICC) and the American Concrete Institute (ACI) for development of first-ever Building Code of Pakistan - Seismic Provisions in 2007. The then Prime Minister of Pakistan acknowledged the landmark achievement and international collaboration between PEC and ICC. The code document was approved by the Cabinet in its meeting held on 9th August, 2007 and thereby Government of Pakistan notified vide S.R.O. 971(1) 2008 dated 8th September 2008. According to notification section (3)“the provisions of the Building Code of Pakistan - Seismic (2007) shall be revised by the Pakistan Engineering Council after every five years or earlier if so required by circumstances”. Over a period of decade, the frequency of earthquakes have been gradually increasing in Pakistan as per real-time recorded seismic data by Pakistan Metrological Department. In fact, there were five major earthquakes ranging from 6.4 Mw to 7.5 Mw hit almost all metropolis cities in Pakistan. Hence, the mandatory revision of the Code was very much needed in view of seismic-resilient design with durable structural strength, modem typologies of building construction and safe practices. For revision of the Code, PEC joined hands with the World Bank, NED-UET, NDRMF, ICC and also constituted a high profile Task Force on updation of Building Code of Pakistan led by Prof. Dr. Sarosh Hashmat Lodi, Vice Chancellor, NED-UET, Karachi and then Member, PEC Governing Body (2018-2021). After a robust exercise, PEC Task Force worked diligently and successfully developed Building Code of Pakistan (BCP-2021) in 2021, which is based on “2021 International Building Code”. It is exclusively developed under international copyright permission granted to PEC by International Code Council.The latest Building Code of Pakistan (2021) provides minimum benchmark to ensure seismic resilient building design with mandatory structural strength for all new buildings and also covering the E&M components. In addition, Appendix A covers first ever “Guidelines for Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings” based on “ASCE/SEI 41 17 Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings”. Appendix-B includes Flood-Resistant Construction" Appendix-C Mapped Earthquake Acceleration Parameters. The implementation of the Code vest with the Authorities Having Jurisdictions (AHJs) within their respective jurisdictions and circles across Pakistan.
