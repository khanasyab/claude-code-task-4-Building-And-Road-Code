Chapter 2 Definitions
User notes:
About this chapter: Codes, by their very nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purpose of the code.
Section 201 General
[BG] 201.1 Scope.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this code, have the meanings indicated in this chapter.
[BG] 201.2 Interchangeability.
Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the masculine gender include the feminine and neuter; the singular number includes the plural and the plural, the singular.
[BG] 201.3 Terms not defined in other codes.
Where terms are not defined through the methods authorized by this section, such terms shall have ordinarily accepted meanings such as the context implies.
Section 202 Defined Terms
[A]ACCEPTABLE METHODS.Design, analysis and testing methods that have been approved for use in developing design solutions for compliance with the requirements of this code. See Section 103.[M]ACCESS (TO).That which enables a device, appliance or equipment to be reached by ready access or by a means that first requires the removal or movement of a panel or similar obstruction [see also “Ready access (to)”].[BG]AMENITY.An attribute of, or system in, the building that provides services or functions related to the use of the building by the occupants or that contributes to the comfort of the occupants, and that is not necessary for the minimum protection of the occupants. For example, an automatic sprinkler system is not a building amenity.[A]ARCHITECT/ENGINEER.The individual architect or engineer who is registered or licensed to practice his or her respective design profession as defined by the statutory requirements of the professional registration laws of the state or jurisdiction in which the project is to be constructed. See Qualification Characteristics in Appendix D.[A]AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENT.A document containing a body of knowledge commonly used by practicing architects or engineers. It represents the state of the art, including accepted engineering practices, test methods, criteria, loads, safety factors, reliability factors and similar technical matters. The document portrays the standard of care normally observed with a particular discipline. The content is promulgated through an open consensus process or a review by professional peers conducted by recognized authoritative professional societies, codes or standards organizations, or governmental bodies.[A]BOUNDING CONDITIONS.Conditions that, if exceeded, invalidate the performance-based design. These could be maximum allowable conditions such as fuel load or type and arrangement of fuel load that must be maintained throughout the life of a building to ensure that design parameters are not exceeded.[A]CODE.The term used in this document to refer to the International Code Council Performance Code for Buildings and Facilities. Other codes in the International Code Council’s family of codes and the National Electrical Code are identified where used.[A]COMMISSIONING.The process of verifying that a system meets design, technical standards and code expectations via inspection, testing and operational functionality.[A]CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS.Design drawings and written, graphic and pictorial documents prepared or assembled for describing the design, location and physical characteristics of the elements of a project necessary for obtaining a permit.[A]CONSULTANT.An individual who provides specialized services to an owner, designer, code official or contractor.[A]CONTRACT REVIEW.Plan review, as defined below, performed by a consultant who is retained by the code official for that purpose.[A]DESIGN GUIDE.A document containing a body of knowledge or information used by practicing architects and engineers that is not required to meet an open consensus requirement.

The entire building or any portion of a building, structure or area, including the site on which such building, structure or area is located, wherein specific services are provided or activities are performed.[A]PEER REVIEW.An independent and objective technical review of the design of a building or structure to examine the proposed conceptual and analytical concepts, objectives and criteria of the design and construction. It shall be conducted by an architect or engineer who has a level of experience in the design of projects similar to the one being reviewed at least comparable to that of the architect or engineer responsible for the project.[A]PERFORMANCE-BASED DESIGN.An engineering approach to design elements of a building based on agreed upon performance goals and objectives, engineering analysis and quantitative assessment of alternatives against the design goals and objectives using accepted engineering tools, methodologies and performance criteria.[A]PLAN REVIEW.A review of the construction documents by the code official to verify conformance to applicable performance and prescriptive code requirements.[A]PRESCRIPTIVE CODES.The International Code Council’s family of codes, which provide specific (design, construction and maintenance) requirements for building, energy conservation, fire prevention, mechanical, plumbing and so forth.[A]QUALITY ASSURANCE.Inspection by code officials, and special inspection and testing by qualified persons and observation by architects/engineers, where applicable, of the construction of a building or structure to verify general conformance with the construction documents, and applicable performance and prescriptive code requirements. [M]
READY ACCESS (TO). That which enables a device, appliance or equipment to be directly reached, without requiring the removal or movement of any panel or similar obstruction [see “Access (to)”]. [A]REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL.An individual who is registered or licensed to practice his or her respective design profession as defined by the statutory requirements of the professional registration laws of the state or jurisdiction in which the project is to be constructed.[A]REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL IN RESPONSIBLE CHARGE.A registered design professional engaged by the owner or the owner’s authorized agent to review and coordinate certain aspects of the project, as determined by the code official, for compatibility with the design of the building or structure, including submittal documents prepared by others, deferred submittal documents and phased submittal documents.[BG]SAFE PLACE.An interior or exterior area wherein protection from hazards is provided by construction or appropriate separation distance.[BF]SAFETY SYSTEMS.Designed systems in the building provided to serve as the protection for the occupants and the building and contents from hazards.[BG]SERIOUS INJURY.An injury requiring hospitalization or multiple visits to a healthcare provider to effect treatment.[A]SPECIAL EXPERT.An individual who has demonstrated qualifications in a specific area, outside the practice of architecture or engineering, by education, training and experience.[A]THIRD-PARTY REVIEW.A term associated with quality assurance and independence from another party whose work product is being reviewed.
