Appendix D Qualification Characteristics for Design and Review of Performance-Based Designs
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix D is provided as a resource to anyone undertaking a performance-based design or review to assess the qualifications of those performing the task. The goal of this appendix is for the tasked design professionals, special experts and competent reviewers to meet technical qualifications in education and experience associated with performance-based design. These qualification characteristics define the level of knowledge or expertise necessary to create or review a performance-based design.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the Administrative Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section D101 General
[A] D101.1 Scope.
In order for anyone to assess and verify that all of the members of a design team have the knowledge and characteristics needed to execute or review a performance-based design, the following lists are provided.

It is important to understand that utilizing this technique relies heavily on the personal ethics of each individual, and a more formal declaration of education, training and experience may be requested by the code official. These characteristics explain the level of expertise necessary to form a complete design team, but they are not a requirement for every member of the team.
[A] D101.2 Registered design professional in responsible charge characteristics.
Registered design professionals in responsible charge shall possess the following qualifications:1.Registered architect or engineer by the state or jurisdiction.2.Knowledge of all facets of the project and the underlying principles of the performance-based code and concepts.3.Ability to perform in the role of point of contact and to coordinate activities between the design team members, owner and code official.4.Ability to ensure that all elements of submittal to the code official are compatible, coordinated, logical, complete and comprehensive in documentation.
[A] D101.3 Registered design professional characteristics.
Registered design professionals shall possess the following qualifications:1.Knowledge of underlying principles of performance-based code and concepts.2.Education, training and experience in performance-based engineering design.3.Skill in risk- and hazard-assessment tools as a design method.4.Ability to utilize performance-based code objectives and to demonstrate compliance through documentation of decision making and solutions.5.High skill level in engineering disciplines needed in performance-based designs for structural, mechanical and fire-protection systems.
[A] D101.4 Special expert characteristics.
Special experts are those individuals who possess the following qualifications:1.Individual has credentials of education and experience in an area of practice that is needed to evaluate risks and safe operations associated with design, operations and special hazards.2.Licensing or registration where required by a state or jurisdiction for the function to be performed.
