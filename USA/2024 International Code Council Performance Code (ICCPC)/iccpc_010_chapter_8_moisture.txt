[BG] 701.3.1 Construction materials.
The quantities of gas, liquid, radiation or solid particles emitted by materials used in the construction of buildings shall not give rise to harmful concentrations at the surface of the material where the material is exposed or in the atmosphere of any space.
[BG] 701.3.2 Glazing.
Glass or other brittle materials with which people are likely to come into contact shall comply with one or more of the following:1.If broken upon impact, break in a way that is unlikely to cause injury.2.Resist a reasonably foreseeable impact without breaking.3.Be reasonably protected from impact.
Section 702 Prevention of Falls
[BG] 702.1 Objective.
To prevent people from unintentionally falling from one level to another.
[BG] 702.2 Functional statement.
Buildings and their facilities shall be constructed to reduce the likelihood of unintentional falls.
[BG] 702.3 Performance requirements.
[BG] 702.3.1 Required barriers.

[BG] 702.3.2 Roofs.
Roofs with permanent access shall have barriers provided.
[BG] 702.3.3 Barrier construction.
Barriers shall be constructed and installed appropriate to the hazard.
[BG] 702.3.4 Openings in barriers.
Where barriers have openings, the openings shall be of an appropriate size and configuration to keep people from falling through based on the anticipated age of the occupants.
Section 703 Construction and Demolition Hazards

[BG] 703.3 Performance requirements.
[BG] 703.3.1 Operations and procedures.
Sequencing of tasks, procedural methods and equipment shall be such that:1.Personnel are protected from injury and illness attributable to hazards present because of the given operation.2.Adjacent property, property on site and equipment are protected from damage from execution of the given tasks.3.Safety procedures limit the accumulation of combustible materials on site and provide safeguards for equipment and operations that represent ignition sources.
[BG] 703.3.2 Protection from natural hazards.
The structure under construction shall be protected from damage due to wind, rain or other natural hazards likely to occur during construction.
[BG] 703.3.3 Protection of personnel.
Provisions for personnel movement, transport and support shall be such that:1.Personnel are protected from injury due to falling.2.Personnel are protected from injury due to falling objects.3.Personnel are protected from injury that could be caused by the particular operations being conducted.4.Exposure to materials that are known to be health hazards is eliminated.
