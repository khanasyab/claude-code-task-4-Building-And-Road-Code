Appendix E Use of Computer Models
User notes:
About this appendix:
Appendix E gives guidance regarding qualifications and information that should be provided when undertaking computer modeling. More specifically, the appendix requests that computer program data be submitted as part of the documentation. Also, limitations and applicability of the model must be included as part of the documentation. Finally, the scenarios used to run the particular model must be justified.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the Administrative Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section E101 General
[A] E101.1 Scope.
This appendix provides guidance on the appropriate use of computer models.
Section E102 Requirements
[A] E102.1 Use and documentation.
The following are issues that shall be addressed where computer models are used in the design of a building or facility.1.Computer modeling work is required to be conducted under the guidance of the registered design professional. Although states or jurisdictions may not require licensing or certification for a computer model operator in areas such as fire, structural, mechanical and energy, knowledge and experience is needed in the application of the program limits and the performance-based design objectives for compliance with performance-based code objectives.2.Computer program data shall be submitted as part of documentation and shall include but not be limited to program name, brief description, type of analysis and application program input and output units and description, and how it is to be used to support design. Statements of exact mathematical model(s) and accompanying submodel(s), if any, uncertainty, assumptions, limitations, scope of applicability and a few reproducible simple benchmark cases shall be included.3.Background data must be submitted to substantiate why particular scenarios are rejected or accepted.
Section E103 Responsibility
[A] E103.1 Registered design professional.
The computer modeling approach is merely a tool for high-speed calculations that provides mathematics calculations, graphical and related results. It is the registered design professional’s responsibility to incorporate the above data and background information required as documentation for his or her design document submittal. See Section 102 for more information on documentation.
