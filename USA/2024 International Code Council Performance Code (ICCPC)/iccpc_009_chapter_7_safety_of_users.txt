Chapter 6 Pedestrian Circulation
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 6 provides performance requirements for three aspects of pedestrian circulation in a building: 1. Means of egress: Section 601 provides guidance by which egress systems for buildings and facilities are designed, evaluated and maintained.2. Accessibility: Section 602 provides guidelines to ensure disabled persons have reasonable access to and use of buildings to an extent consistent with that to which people without disabilities are able to access and use buildings. This is consistent with the intent of federal statutes enacted to protect the rights of people with disabilities.3. Transportation equipment: Section 603 provides general safety guidelines for installation of elevators, dumbwaiters and escalators inside or outside buildings. These provisions include use during normal operations, use by firefighters during emergency operations and use by maintenance personnel during activities associated with adjusting, servicing and inspecting elevators.
Section 601 Means of Egress
[BE] 601.1 Objective.
To protect people during egress and rescue operations.
[BE] 601.2 Functional statement.
Enable occupants to exit the building, facility and premises or reach a safe place as appropriate to the design performance level determined in Chapter 3.
[BE] 601.3 Performance requirements.
[BE] 601.3.1 General.
The construction, arrangement and number of means of egress, exits and safe places for buildings shall be appropriate to the travel distance, number of occupants, occupant characteristics, building height, and safety systems and features.
[BE] 601.3.2 Identification, illumination and safety of means of egress.
Means of egress shall be clearly identified, provided with adequate illumination and be easy and safe to use.
[BE] 601.3.3 Unobstructed path.
Means of egress shall provide an unobstructed path of travel from each safe place to not less than one exit.
[BE] 601.3.4 Protection from untenable conditions.
Each safe place shall provide adequate protection from untenable conditions, an appropriate communication system and adequate space for the intended occupants.
[BE] 601.3.5 Human biomechanics and expectation of consistency.
Means of egress shall enable reasonable use by the occupants in the building with due regard to human biomechanics and expectation of consistency.
[BE] 601.3.6 Maintenance of means-of-egress systems.
Suitable means of egress shall be provided in satisfactory arrangement throughout all buildings, facilities and premises, regardless of when they were constructed, based on the number and character of occupants, length of travel, provision of existing alternative paths, timeline of emergency detection and response, risk level, time to exit and safety systems provided.
[BE] 601.3.7 Maintenance of clear path.
Means of egress shall be maintained without obstructions or reductions in capacity that would hinder the ability of the occupants to egress safely.
[BE] 601.3.8 Interference with identification of exits.
Means of egress shall be readily identifiable. Buildings shall be operated and maintained in a manner that does not interfere with the identification of exits.
[BE] 601.3.9 Ease of use.
Means of egress shall be maintained and operated in such a manner to ensure that all egress facilities are readily openable and available without special knowledge or effort consistent with the use or occupancy characteristics.
[BE] 601.3.10 Maintenance of illumination.
Means of egress shall be maintained and operated in such a manner to ensure that adequate lighting to facilitate safe egress is available.
Section 602 Accessibility
[BE] 602.1 Objective.
To provide people with disabilities reasonable use of the built environment in a manner consistent with that provided to people without disabilities in nonemergency conditions.
[BE] 602.2 Functional statement.
Buildings and their site-adjacent facilities shall allow all people, including but not limited to people with disabilities, functional use of spaces based on a space’s intended purpose.
[BE] 602.3 Performance requirements.
Safe and usable routes shall be provided that allow people to:1.Approach, enter and leave buildings and sites to and from adjacent transportation stops, walkways and parking areas.2.Move within and use building and site spaces based on a facility’s intended purpose.
Section 603 Transportation Equipment
[BG] 603.1 Objective.
To ensure the safety of all people using, maintaining and inspecting elevators, escalators and similar building transportation equipment inside or outside of buildings.
[BG] 603.2 Functional statement.
Building transportation equipment installations for access into, within and outside of buildings shall provide for the safe movement of all people and the safety of maintenance and inspection personnel.
[BG] 603.3 Performance requirements.
[BG] 603.3.1 General.
Building transportation equipment shall:1.Move people safely when starting, stopping, accelerating, decelerating or changing direction of travel, and hold the rated loads.2.Be constructed to avoid the likelihood of people falling, tripping, becoming caught and coming in contact with sharp edges or projections under normal and reasonably foreseeable conditions of use.3.Be guided and have sufficient running clearances.4.Have controls to stop and prevent restarting in the event of activation of a safety device.5.Be capable of being isolated for inspection, testing and maintenance.6.Have adequate lighting and ventilation during normal conditions or upon loss of normal power.
[BG] 603.3.2 Elevators.
Elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide:1.A means of communication for trapped passengers in stalled elevators.2.Emergency recall operation that discharges passengers at the required designated or alternate landing in the event of a fire emergency.3.Emergency in-car operation for firefighting and rescue operations.4.An environment that ensures the safe operation of the equipment for the anticipated use or application.
