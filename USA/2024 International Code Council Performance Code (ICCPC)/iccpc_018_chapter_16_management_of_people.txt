Chapter 15 Fire Prevention and Impact Management
User notes:
About this chapter: There are two ways to deal with fire: it can either be prevented or managed. Chapter 15 provides requirements for fire prevention and fire management. Fire prevention is considered one of the more popular roles that fire codes have traditionally filled. The expectation is to limit unwanted ignition to an acceptable level. It is unreasonable to believe that all unwanted ignition can be eliminated. The fire prevention requirements of Chapter 15 are strongly linked to Chapter 16, Management of People, as many fires can be prevented by adequate training and safety procedures. Public education has a significant impact on individual awareness of fire issues and the likelihood of people exhibiting fire-safe behavior. This chapter also provides requirements related to the management of the impact of a fire event in a building or structure. These provisions assume that a fire can occur despite any “prevent fire” measures that are being taken. The objective is to limit the impact of a fire to an acceptable level on the occupants, the general public and the building or other structure, including its contents, use and processes. Other inherent objectives include providing some level of protection for the facility’s mission and revenue stream and the community tax base.
Section 1501 Fire Prevention

[F] 1502.3.15.1 Design fire events.
Magnitudes of design fire events shall be described in terms of the potential spread of fire and fire effluents given the proposed design, arrangement, construction, furnishing and use of a building.
[F] 1502.3.15.2 Range of fire sizes.
Magnitudes of design fire events shall be defined as small, medium, large and very large, based on the quantification of the design fire event as a function of the building use and associated performance group.

Quantification of the magnitudes of design fire events shall be based on engineering analyses of potential fire scenarios that can be expected to impact a building through its intended life. For each design fire scenario considered, the analyses shall include the ignitability of the first item, the peak heat release rate of the item first ignited, the rate of heat release and expected fire growth, and the overall fuel load, geometry, and ventilation of the space and adjoining spaces.
[F] 1502.3.15.3.1 Relationship of design fire to tolerable damage.
When determining (assigning) the magnitude of a design fire event, the physical properties of the fire and its effluents shall only be considered in terms of how they impact the levels of tolerable damage. The magnitude of the fire event is not required to be characterized solely on the basis of the physical size of the fire in terms of its heat release and smoke production rates.
[F] 1502.3.15.3.2 Design parameters.
Multiple design fire scenarios, ranging from small to very large design fire events, shall be considered to ensure that associated levels of tolerable damage are not exceeded as appropriate to the performance group.
[F] 1502.3.15.3.3 Factors in determining design fire scenarios.
The development of design fire scenarios shall consider the use of the room of fire origin and adjoining spaces, in terms of impact on occupant, property and community welfare.
[F] 1502.3.15.3.4 Justification.
Justification of the magnitudes of design fire events and design fire scenarios shall be part of the analysis prepared by the registered design professional and shall take into consideration the reasonableness, frequency and severity of the design fire event and design fire scenarios.
[F] 1502.3.15.3.5 Safety factors.
Design fires and fire scenarios shall be chosen to provide appropriate factors of safety to provide adequate performance by accounting for the following factors:1.Effects of uncertainties arising from construction activities.2.Variations in the properties of materials and the characteristics of the site.3.Accuracy limitations inherent in the methods used to predict the fire safety of the building.4.Variations in the conditions of facilities, systems, contents and occupants.
