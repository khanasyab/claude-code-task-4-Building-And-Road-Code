Chapter 16 Management of People
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 16 addresses tasks people might execute in a performance design. Many times, hazardous materials facilities depend on building occupants and users to perform certain tasks to avoid and mitigate emergencies. These activities are considered integral to the success of such facilities. Other examples include restrictions on the types of appliances allowed in the lunchroom or the number of staff available for certain types of events, such as sporting events. This chapter outlines not only the more traditional prevention and protection skills that existing prescriptive codes require, but also requires that where the actions or practices of people become a component of a design, such actions and practices must be maintained.

Through training and education, ensure that people possess the necessary skills and implement the appropriate actions to prevent fires or other emergencies as appropriate to the design performance level determined in Chapter 3.
[F] 1601.2.2 Training and education for mitigation of fires and other emergencies.
Through training and education, ensure that people possess the necessary skills and implement the appropriate actions during a fire or other emergency as appropriate to the design performance level determined in Chapter 3.

[F] 1601.3.4 Procedure development and training for mitigation.
Develop procedures and conduct training so that occupants and staff can take the appropriate actions in the event of a fire or other emergency.

[F] 1601.3.9 Management of change.

[F] 1601.3.10 Documentation of reliance on occupants and staff.
