Appendix D Qualification Characteristics for Design and Review of Performance-Based Designs
This appendix is provided as a resource to anyone undertaking a performance-based design or review to assess qualifications of the participants performing the task. The goal of this appendix is for the design professionals, special experts and competent reviewers to have technical qualifications in education and experience associated with performance-based design. These qualification characteristics define the level of knowledge or expertise necessary to perform the functions.Design professionals who are in responsible charge of a professional design discipline (e.g., architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, etc.) must have the experience and expertise in performance-based design to satisfy this appendix and Section 102.3.2 of the code. Individuals on the design team within a professional discipline may supplement the design professional or principal design professional’s experience to meet the requirements of this appendix.Qualification statements must be submitted to the code official as stated in Section 102.3.2 to demonstrate compliance with this appendix. The code official has the responsibility to acquire and assign competent reviewers of performance designs and to comply with the goal of this appendix. When the code official does not have competent reviewers on staff, consultant review services should be obtained. Peer review Though this appendix does not specifically address peer reviewer qualifications, the following text is provided for information purposes. It is excerpted from the peer review guidelines from Section 1617A.1.41 of the 2022 California Building Code (Title 24, Part 2). Section 1617A.1.41 Peer Review Requirements. [OSHPD 1, 1R, 2, 4, & 5]
1.
General. Independent peer review is an objective technical review by knowledgeable reviewer(s) experienced in structural design, analysis and performance issues involved. The reviewer(s) shall examine the available information on the condition of the building, basic engineering concept employed and recommendations for action.
2.
Timing of Independent Review. The independent reviewer (s) shall be selected prior to initiation of substantial portion of the design and analysis work that is to be reviewed, and review shall start as soon as practical and sufficient information defining the project is available.
3.
Qualifications and Terms of Employment. The reviewer shall be independent from the design and construction team.
3.1.
The reviewer(s) shall have no other involvement in the project before, during or after the review, except in a review capacity.
3.2.
The reviewer shall be selected and paid by owner and shall have technical expertise similar to the project being reviewed, as determined by enforcement agent.
3.3.
The reviewer (in case of review team, the chair) shall be a California-licensed structural engineer who is familiar with technical issues and regulations governing the work to be reviewed.
3.4.
The reviewer shall serve through completion of the project and shall not be terminated except for failure to perform the duties specified herein. Such termination shall be in writing with copies to enforcement agent, owner and the engineer of record. When a reviewer is terminated or resigns, a qualified replacement shall be appointed within 10 working days or a timeframe mutually agreed to by the Owner, Registered Design Professional (RDP) and the Office.
4.
Scope of Review. Review activities shall include, where appropriate, available construction documents, design criteria, observation of the condition of structure, all new and original inspection reports, including methods of sampling, analyses prepared by the engineer of record and consultants, and the new, retrofit or repair design. Review shall include consideration of the proposed design approach, method, materials and details.
5.
Reports. The reviewer(s) shall prepare a written report to the owner and responsible enforcement agent that covers all aspect of the review performed including conclusions reached by the reviewer. Report shall be issued after the schematic phase, during design development, and at the completion of construction documents, but prior to their issuance of permit. Such report shall include, at the minimum, statement of the following:
a.
Scope of engineering design peer review with limitations defined.
b.
The status of the project documents at each review stage.
c.
Ability of selected materials and framing systems to meet the performance criteria with given loads and configuration.
d.
Degree of structural system redundancy and the deformation compatibility among structural and nonstructural elements.
e.
Basic constructability of the new, retrofit or repair system.
f.
Other recommendation that will be appropriate for the specific project.
g.
Presentation of the conclusions of the reviewer identifying any areas that need further review, investigation and/or clarification.
h.
Recommendations.
