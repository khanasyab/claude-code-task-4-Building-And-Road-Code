Appendix B Worksheet for Assigning Specific Structures to Performance Groups
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix B allows the adjustment of performance groups based on occupants or the unique features of a building. Table B101.1 can be used for two purposes. If a facility is being evaluated, and there is no clear means of determining a performance group because the facility is not similar to occupancies described in Table 303.1, Table B101.1 can be used as a subjective means of evaluating the associated risks. From that evaluation, a performance group can be developed. A second use of Table B101.1 would be to evaluate the impact of unusual features in a building or facility for which the performance group is identified in Table 303.1.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IBC—General Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section B101 Risk Factor
[BG] B101.1 General.
Table B101.1 shall be used as a guide for determining the appropriate performance group allocation for specific structures that have unique characteristics.
[BG] TABLEB101.1 WORKSHEET FORASSIGNING SPECIFIC STRUCTURES TO PERFORMANCE GROUPS
RISK FACTORS
RELATIVE LEVEL OF RISK FOR SPECIFIC STRUCTURE
Occupant Load. Maximum number of persons permitted to be in the structure or a portion of the structure.
Duration. Maximum length of time that the structure is significantly occupied.
Sleeping. Do people normally sleep in the building?
Occupant Familiarity. Are occupants expected to be familiar with the building layout and means of egress?
Occupant Vulnerability. What percentage of occupants, employees or visitors is considered to comprise members of a vulnerable population?
Dependent Relationships. Is there a significant percentage of occupants or visitors who are expected to have relationships that may delay egress from the building?
HAZARD FACTORS
Nature of the Hazard. What is the nature of the hazard, and what are its impacts on the occupants, the structure and the contents?
Internal or External Hazard. Is the hazard likely to originate internally or externally or both?
LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE
Population. Are large numbers of people expected to be present?
Essential Facilities. Is the structure required for emergency response or post-disaster emergency treatment, utilities, communications or housing?
Damage Potential. Is significant risk of widespread and/or long-term injuries, deaths or damage possible from the failure of the structure?
Community Importance. Is the structure or its use largely responsible for economic stability or other important functions of the community?
SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS
Are the design performance levels adequate and appropriate for the specific structure?
