Chapter 12 Fuel Gas
Section 1201 Fuel Gas Piping and Vents
1201.1 Objective
This section ensures that fuel gas is used in a manner that does not create a hazard to the occupants. This primarily means that the fuel gas be used in a manner that does not permit unsafe levels of combustible byproducts or make it a source of ignition of an unwanted fire.
1201.2 Functional statement
When fuel gas is used as an energy source, the installation must be safe. This applies to all aspects of its use, including installation of an appliance, piping system, venting, oxygen depletion safety shutoff system (ODS), safety controls, clearances from combustibles, etc.
1201.3 Performance requirements
Many issues must be addressed in order to ensure that fuel gas is used safely as an energy source. Safe operation of appliances requires that supply systems be properly sized to deliver fuel gas at the pressure required by the appliance. An automatic shutoff system must be installed to safeguard occupants from unsafe conditions should the appliance malfunction.Gas appliances require adequate combustion air for proper operation when multiple gas appliances are installed in the same space, and care must be taken to ensure there is enough combustion air for all appliances operating simultaneously. Gas appliances may be vented or unvented depending on the appliance’s listing. To remove the products of combustion, appliances will be vented to the exterior of the building by the use of flues. When multiple gas appliances are connected to the same flue it must be done so that there is no spillage of exhaust gas. The products of combustion for unvented appliances will not be vented to the exterior of the building by the use of flues but will be vented into the atmosphere of the room or space. Gas appliances must be provided with individual shutoff valves so that they can be safely maintained, tested or repaired without shutting off the main supply. Gas appliances must be tested and maintained according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The supply system in the building must be designed and installed to prevent adverse effects on the utility’s supply or other users connected to the system.Acceptable methodsThe International Fuel Gas Code® (IFGC®) is an acceptable prescriptive method related to the objectives of this chapter.
