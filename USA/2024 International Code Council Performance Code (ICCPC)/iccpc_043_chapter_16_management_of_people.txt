Chapter 15 Fire Prevention and Impact Management
There are two ways to deal with fire: it can either be prevented or managed.
Section 1501 Fire Prevention
Prevention is an essential emphasis of fire codes. It is also recognized that the expectation is to limit unwanted ignition to an acceptable level. It is unreasonable to believe that all unwanted ignition can be eliminated.Section 1501 addresses both temporary ignition sources, such as welding, and more permanent installations, such as water heaters. Section 1501 focuses on building equipment and systems and fuel load interaction with ignitions sources. The inclusion of building equipment and systems requirements were influenced by codes such as the National Electrical Code, the International Fuel Gas Code®(IFGC®) and the International Mechanical Code®(IMC®). The provisions of Section 1501 addressing fuel load interactions with ignition sources are focused more on the fire code provisions, which typically place greater emphasis on preventing ignition than does the building code.This section of the performance code is strongly linked to Chapter 16, Management of People, as it recognizes that many fires can be prevented by adequate training and safety procedures. Likewise, public education has a significant impact on individual awareness of fire issues, hence the likelihood of people exhibiting fire-safe behavior.The purpose of this section is to reduce the potential of permanently installed building equipment, appliances and services to cause a fire because of their installation. All types of permanently installed equipment, appliances and services represent potential ignition hazards and need to be installed in a fashion that minimizes or prevents these hazards from occurring. Fuel-burning equipment, including gas, oil and solid fuel-fired types, can, by their nature, transfer heat to building materials when located too close to such materials. Electrical equipment produces heat and potential sparks, thus requiring clearances to combustible materials and hazards such as areas where flammable vapors are likely. Additionally, should a spark or flame escape the equipment or appliance enclosure, ignition of building materials or contents can occur. These provisions were developed with the potential hazards of this equipment in mind.Because many fires can be prevented by exercising appropriate fire-safe behaviors or practices, it is essential that procedures and training for occupants to facilitate fire-prevention objectives be developed. These must be documented appropriately where they are integral to the strategy for meeting the objective and should include appropriate expectations for follow-up and monitoring.
1501.1 Objective
This section contains provisions related to several aspects of preventing ignition. These provisions intend to prevent the ignition of building materials caused by permanently installed equipment, appliances or services and from portable equipment or appliances, which are connected by cord and plug. More permanently installed equipment is typically regulated by construction codes and more temporary appliances and equipment are typically regulated by the codes such as the International Fire Code® (IFC®). In addition, the requirements are also focused on hazards such as welding and cutting operations, hazardous materials processes and smoking. The prescriptive regulatory solutions will likely be found in several locations due to the scoping of such issues. Construction codes such as the International Building Code® (IBC®), International Existing Building Code® ( IEBC®), IMC, IFGC and the NEC will regulate permanent installations of equipment and systems. Codes such as the IFC, which contains many operational requirements, will address portable appliances and equipment and also hazardous materials and operations.
1501.2 Functional statement
The main functional statement generally encompasses all ignition hazards, but the two more specific functional statements address the need for fuel-fired or electrical equipment, appliances or services to be installed in a manner that reduces the potential for the installation to be a source of ignition. Fuel-burning appliances and electrical equipment are generally intended for installation in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. These instructions should be provided as part of the design submittal to determine if the equipment is being installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. If the equipment has not been listed or independently evaluated for safety, it is up to the designer to demonstrate to the code official that the equipment installation provides an acceptable level of safety.To avoid the equipment becoming a potential source of ignition, several factors need to be considered. Appliances must not generate temperatures or operate under conditions that could ignite nearby combustible materials. Electrical conductors and components must not create a condition in which they will overheat and ignite combustibles either in or near the appliance, or in the branch circuit wiring supplying the product. Additionally, the equipment must provide an acceptable level of performance under normal operating conditions and any other conditions that may be encountered during the life of the product.Standards for safety have been developed for most fuel-burning and electrical appliances and equipment by organizations such as UL and ASTM. These standards provide a comprehensive set of safety criteria with which to evaluate the ability of the equipment to not produce an undesired source of fire ignition. These standards are customized to address safety conditions that are unique to the specific appliance or equipment.Equipment that has been listed by an approved testing and certification laboratory has undergone an independent safety investigation. As part of the listing, the certification agency evaluates the equipment and certifies that it complies with appropriate safety standards when installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions. Equipment installed within the limitations of its listings and in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions can generally be considered to not serve as a source of fire ignition.It is also necessary to periodically test and maintain appliances and equipment in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and in accordance with any referenced installation and use standards to ensure that the appliances and equipment do not create a potential source of fire ignition during the life of the product.When it comes to less permanent and general ignition hazards, control of heat/energy sources to limit the occurrence of unwanted ignition would be accomplished, for example, by controlling open burning, open flames, smoking, torches for removing paint, electrical safety (extension cords), asphalt kettles and unsafe chimneys. Suitable controls and procedures must be identified in meeting the objectives of other sections of this document to prevent ignition. Providing and using equipment that is suitable to the environment they will be exposed to, and in compliance with the listing, are basic expectations to meet this objective. Similarly, maintaining all equipment so that a fire hazard does not exist is important.
1501.3 Performance requirements
The performance requirements are intended to provide more detailed intent of the provision. These provisions will likely link more closely with the prescriptive codes or approved documents. The first performance requirement is focused on built-in equipment and systems integral to the building. The other two focus on reduction of fuel sources and the interaction of fuel and ignition sourcesIt is the designer’s responsibility to assess the ignition sources and take whatever actions are necessary to develop a solution that will limit these sources. Though the goal should be to eliminate these sources, it is recognized that it may not be possible to completely eliminate all sources in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, a balance of preventing ignition and managing fire is necessary.In all cases, the fire risk or probability of ignition, as well as the impact of even a minor fire, must be considered. Special consideration needs to be given to buildings or facilities based on their respective performance groups as defined in Chapter 3.In addition to the ignition source being controlled, the fuel hazards can be controlled by limiting the quantity, composition or configuration of the material so that the occurrence of unwanted ignition is limited. This can be accomplished, for example, by specifying requirements for interior finish, furnishings, cleaning of commercial cooking exhausts, accumulation and storage of combustible waste and other combustible fuel loadings (Christmas trees). These examples are not intended to be exhaustive.It is recognized that in some cases both ignition sources and fuel hazards may be present. An appropriate strategy to meet the objective may be to provide and maintain barriers or separations between the heat ignition source and the fuel supply, thereby limiting the effects of radiant, convection and conduction heating.Examples of employing the strategy of maintaining barriers or separations would be the prescriptive provisions for fire-resistant rated assemblies, electrical panel clearance requirements and electrical wiring clearance requirements. Again, these examples are not intended to be exhaustive. This strategy must also be extended to things such as controlling the access of unauthorized individuals to the location of fuel hazards. This can be accomplished, for example, by securing vacant buildings or controlling access to certain areas of the building or facility. Where security cannot be guaranteed in instances such as these, then all fuel hazards should be removed. Consideration should also be given to limiting untrained individuals to certain activities or locations. In addition, the maintenance or respective safeguards should take into account accidental occurrences such as vehicle accidents and impacts that can render well-designed separation strategies inoperative.The heightened security that has been added in and around high-rises and stadia since the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center disaster is another example of a fire prevention solution to factor into a performance design. Indeed, even the security at airports can be considered part of a system of fire prevention protection for our buildings and infrastructure. As discussed in Section 305, building and fire codes have not usually addressed issues such as terrorism. Therefore, fire prevention related to such anticipated ignition sources will need to be explicitly acknowledged as potential events to explain the various fire prevention measures taken.
Section 1502 Fire Impact Management
General Section 1502 provides objectives, functional statements and performance requirements for managing the impact of a potential fire event that can occur in a building or facility. This section assumes that a fire can occur in the buildings or facilities despite any “prevent fire” measures that are being taken. The objective is to limit the impact of a fire to an acceptable level on the occupants, the general public and the building or facility, including its contents, use and processes. Other inherent objectives in this section are to provide some level of protection for the building or facility’s mission and revenue stream and the community tax base. In general, those are the underlying themes of building and fire regulations in the United States. Often, insurance companies may require higher performance due to the cost associated with insuring the building or facility or as a way to reduce premiums. In some countries the focus of the regulations is more about life safety and more emphasis is placed on the owner and insurer for property protection. Generally, the prescriptive codes have been seen as minimum requirements.
1502.1 Objective
This section is intended to reduce the likelihood of death or injury to an acceptable level to those persons involved in a fire within the building or facility. It also prevents or reduces damage or loss of property because of the spread of fire within a structure or to an adjacent structure. “Persons involved” include building occupants, emergency responders and people in the vicinity of the building or facility. Consideration is also given to the impact a fire may have on the use of the building or facility, including any process associated with the building or facility. The objective statement is a continuation of the basic principle of building and fire codes from the beginning of code development. The difference is that this format provides the opportunity for the reader to understand the overall intended performance of a particular building or facility in a fire event and how different subsystems interact to achieve the desired objective.
1502.2 Functional statements
The general functional statement sets a single performance level for fire life safety but sets multiple upper limits for property damage based on the performance group classification of the facility.A functional statement of particular interest is Section 1502.2.8, which places specific emphasis on providing a level of fire safety for occupants with physical or mental disabilities that is comparable to that provided for those who do not have such disabilities. Generally, the code applies to all occupants regardless of their physical or mental abilities.To provide for the safety of people and property involved in a building fire and to provide the facilities for firefighting and rescue operations, it is imperative that the design community place elements into the structure that will mitigate the growth potential of a fire. This section indicates the need for the building to have safeguards designed into it to achieve the objectives related to the protection of people and property. Specifically, the code states that a person not directly adjacent to or involved in the ignition of a fire must not suffer serious injury or death. It goes on to state that property loss has an upper limit based on the performance group assignment from Chapter 3. This section therefore establishes a single performance level with regard to occupant and public safety and an upper limit on the levels of damage with regard to property protection dependent on the performance group.This particular functional statement is linked to Chapter 3 for guidance on the levels of performance. Because fire is an event whose magnitude is dependent on many factors related to the use, construction, configuration, size and contents of a building or facility, evaluating fire based on a simplistic relationship between magnitude of event and level of damage was not only inappropriate but extremely difficult; therefore, the requirements state “consistent with the performance group determined in Chapter 3.” The general relationship between magnitude of event and level of damage presented in Chapter 3 is not completely invalid for fire, but the many interdependencies related to fire events must be specifically accounted for and understood. It should be noted that the more simplistic relationship between event magnitude and level of damage is more easily applied to seismic events or wind events because a building or facility will have no effect on the size (magnitude) of an earthquake or hurricane.In addition to the concern with dependent factors, there was a concern that the levels of impact that were generically provided for all events, specifically life safety, were not necessarily appropriate for events such as fire. Society has a very low tolerance for death or serious injury caused by fires, especially of large numbers in a single incident. In addressing this low tolerance, this section in effect establishes a single performance level with regard to life safety in buildings, which basically equates to a mild impact for all fire events.This single performance level recognizes that it is very difficult to protect someone who is intimately involved with the fire or in the immediate vicinity of the ignition point or source. Society does, however, have a higher tolerance for property loss, taking into account the importance of the building, which is why the upper limit of damage to be tolerated is based on the performance group classification of the building. Clearly the approach has been to separate property protection from life safety, which are two distinct objectives of building and fire codes. The performance level chosen is ultimately a public policy decision that reflects the expectations of society. Such expectations fluctuate in light of certain events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks such as those on the World Trade Center. In particular, the World Trade Center tower collapses resulting from the attack on 9/11 sparked considerable discussion and debate over the expectations of society for building construction.The discussion of the events of 9/11 has generally never quantified to what level a building should be protected from such events, but the resulting recommendations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology WTC study have targeted specific issues within building and fire codes. It is not believed that buildings in general be protected from extreme events such as those of 9/11, but the study did reveal areas that can enhance the safety in buildings such as high-rise buildings, particularly very tall high-rise buildings that must self-sustain due to their height during an emergency. Also, very tall buildings are those more likely to be iconic in stature and warrant additional protection. There have been several changes specific to high-rise buildings in the IBC in recent years that relate to these enhancements. They primarily relate to structural integrity during fire, egress and firefighter safety. More specifically, in buildings over 420 feet (128 m) in height, fire-resistance reductions typically allowed for all high-rise buildings are no longer allowed. Additionally, reductions in column protection is not allowed in any high-rise building. Another structural fire protection enhancement relates to increased requirements for the bond strength of sprayed fire-resistance materials for high-rise buildings. In terms of egress, an additional stair has been added to buildings over 420 feet (128 m) in building height intended to address concerns of “counterflow.” Counterflow is the issue of egress and fire department activities interfering with one another. Another issue related to egress is the use of elevators for egress, which in the IBC is explicitly allowed under certain conditions. In terms of firefighter safety, buildings with an occupied floor over 120 feet (36.6 m) from the lowest level of fire department vehicle access require two fire service access elevators (FSAE). This elevator is a part of a package of requirements including elements such as protected lobbies and stairs adjacent to the lobby (or a protected path to the stairway) that contain standpipes. All of these elements serve to increase the baseline of safety expected from prescriptive building and fire codes. Generally, a performance code already addresses these elements in the form of objectives, functional statements and performance requirements. The prescriptive code simply creates one of the solutions, which tends to provide a baseline for design.Please note that a resource focused on fire protection for very tall buildings has been jointly developed by the Society of Fire Protection Engineers and the ICC. The document, now in its second edition, is titled Engineering Guide—Fire Safety For Very Tall Buildings (2021). The document provides a performance-based perspective of issues that are specific to very tall (high-rise) buildings.As noted numerous times within this User’s Guide, it is very difficult to understand the specific level of performance provided by the prescriptive code because the prescriptive code focuses on one or a limited number of solutions. The ICC Performance Code® for Buildings and Facilities has attempted to capture the intent of the prescriptive code.
1502.3 Performance requirements
The Fire Safety Concepts Tree, as published in NFPA 550, implies that fire safety requires either the prevention of a fire or the management of the impact of a fire that does occur. Managing the impact of a fire involves managing both the fire and the occupants of the facility that are exposed to that fire. In this document, managing the exposed occupants is addressed in Section 601, so those performance requirements are found there. The performance requirements in Section 1502.3 address the other strategies of controlling combustion or controlling fire spread. The general performance statement first makes a link back to the performance level stated in the functional statement by declaring, “Facilities or portions thereof shall be designed, constructed and operated to normally prevent any fire from growing to a stage that would cause life loss or serious injury.” This section also states that should a facility sustain local fire damage it must remain intact as a whole, and not be damaged to an extent disproportionate to the local damage. For instance, a small wastebasket fire in a large open warehouse should not impair the structural integrity of the building or cause significant damage to the stored commodities. The remaining performance requirements refer to the more detailed elements of the building or facility, such as interior finishes, concealed spaces and vertical openings.Fire management includes both active and passive fire protection strategies. Passive strategies include compartmentation (using fire-resistive materials) and structural fire resistance, while active strategies include fire detection systems, automatic fire suppression systems and manual firefighting. In this document, the provisions addressing manual firefighting by emergency response personnel are covered in Section 1502.3.3, as well as in Chapter 17, Emergency Access and Facilities, and Chapter 18, Emergency Responder Safety.A fire can be managed by controlling the combustion process and the fire loading to restrict the size and rate of growth of the fire, or it can be controlled by limiting the spread of fire through the building and to adjacent buildings using active or passive means. Fire management can also be accomplished by a combination of the two approaches.Controlling the combustion process and the fire environment involves limiting, where possible, the fuel loading in the facility to reduce the potential size and growth rate of a fire that does occur. Prescriptive fire codes have usually dealt with the concept of managing fire impact by controlling the fuel loading within buildings for special hazards. An example of such provisions is the maximum allowable quantities of flammable liquids allowed in nonhazardous occupancies (Chapters 3 and 4 of the IBC and Chapters 50 and 57 of the IFC.Limiting the spread of fire and products of combustion through a building is also a function of managing the fire. This can be accomplished through passive methods such as providing fire-rated compartment barriers and opening protection, smoke barriers, shaft enclosures and fire-resistance-rated construction isolating higher hazard areas. Active systems, such as automatic sprinkler systems, other fire extinguishing systems and smoke management systems may also be relied on to prevent the spread of fire and products of combustion throughout the building. Fire detection and alarm systems may also be considered as a means to initiate efforts to limit the spread of fire through the building, either by automatic activation, such as activation of smoke control systems or HVAC system shutdown, or by providing notification for initiating manual mitigation efforts by responsible employees or the public fire department. As indicated above, issues related to the notification, response and operation of emergency responder personnel are covered in other areas of this document.Managing the fire impact also applies to reducing the impact of a fire on adjacent properties, processes and facilities. Features such as fire-resistance-rated exterior walls and exterior opening protectives, barriers to radiant heat exposure and water spray systems are intended to reduce the impact to these exposed facilities.In addition to limiting fire spread to adjacent buildings, managing the fire impact also includes limiting the spread of fire to the building in question from an exposure fire. The use of fuel modification zones and special construction methods in wildland fire areas are good examples of this strategy. Providing adequate separation distances to aboveground fuel storage tanks is another tactic.As stated above, a variety of strategies can be employed to manage the impact of a fire. Additionally, varying degrees of performance can be achieved. The necessary performance depends on many factors, such as building use and construction characteristics, occupant characteristics, location of the building, etc. As noted earlier, the functional statement establishes a single level of performance for fire life safety and provides upper limits for property loss, depending on the performance group designation of the building. To assist in the analysis, the magnitudes of possible fire events need to be established based on the fire load present and its impact evaluated against the specified level of performance.Section 1502.3.15 and associated subsections specifically focus on the determination of the magnitude of events (i.e., fire scenarios) to be used in the analysis. This section requires the design fire events to realistically reflect the ignition, growth and spread potential of fires and fire effluents. Unlike for a natural hazard event, many elements of the building and its contents must be taken into account when developing fire scenarios to be used in the analysis. This section provides specific guidance on how the analysis is to be undertaken with regard to ignitability, heat release rate and overall fuel load. A key requirement is that the analysis must specifically look at a range of fire sizes to ensure that a small fire event does not create an unreasonable amount of damage and that a very large fire event satisfies the limits on the extent of damage based on the performance group. In no case should there be any anticipated loss of life or serious injury to persons not intimate with the initiation of the fire event, regardless of its magnitude.The analysis with regard to fire will involve a single performance level for life safety and upper limits on property loss based on the performance group designation.Fire-safety engineering and fire science currently involve a significant amount of uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge and accurate data in certain areas. Therefore, similar to the requirements of Chapter 5 for structural stability, one of the performance requirements specifies that design fires and fire scenarios be chosen that provide appropriate factors of safety or a given degree of redundancy between active and passive fire protection strategies. Addressing issues such as terrorism, in the wake of the 9/11 World Trade Center disaster, makes such uncertainty greater. The prescriptive codes have not typically addressed such events; therefore, a specific decision to address such scenarios would need to be made either by the community or by building owner. This code establishes a framework to factor in such issues.Acceptable methods Sources of ignition. As noted previously, the prescriptive code documents may include the IFC, IMC, the IFGC and the National Electrical Code. The listing requirements and manufacturer’s instructions provide an additional set of prescriptive guidance documents to achieve the objectives.Management of fire impact. As discussed earlier, the IBC deals with the management of fire impact in many areas including, but not limited to, Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14
and 26. Other I-Codes have a role in managing fire impact, including the IFC, IEBC and International Residential Code® (IRC®).
