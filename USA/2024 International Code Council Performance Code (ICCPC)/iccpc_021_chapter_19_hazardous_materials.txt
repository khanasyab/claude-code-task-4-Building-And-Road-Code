Chapter 18 Emergency Responder Safety
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 18 addresses the major issues impacting emergency responder safety. The prescriptive codes have always made provisions to lessen the dangers to emergency responders, firefighters in particular; however, this code takes the next step and places these concerns into a separate chapter. This does not mean that provisions found elsewhere in this document do not also pertain to firefighter safety, but only that issues specific thereto are addressed in this chapter. Such provisions can also be found in the chapters on egress, access and hazardous materials.
Section 1801 Emergency Responder Safety
[F] 1801.1 Objective.
To protect emergency responders from unreasonable risks during emergencies.
[F] 1801.2 Functional statements.
As appropriate to the design performance level determined in Chapter 3, the following shall be provided:1.Information to responders regarding hazards present at the building or premises.2.Protection against unanticipated structural collapse.3.Appropriate fire service communications capability.
[F] 1801.3 Performance requirements.
[F] 1801.3.1 Identification of hazards.
Where hazards are present in the building, facility or premises that could endanger emergency responders beyond what would normally be anticipated, means shall be provided to alert the responders to the hazards.
[F] 1801.3.2 Signage.
Signage shall be provided as needed to identify special hazards to the emergency responders (and to the degree applicable, the nature of the hazard).
[F] 1801.3.3 Collapse.
Buildings and structures shall be designed, constructed, loaded and maintained so that the potential for structural collapse is predictable based on the construction method, building condition and fire size, location and duration.
[F] 1801.3.4 Communication systems.
Communication systems for use by the emergency responders must be provided where the size, construction or complexity of the building cause the emergency responders’ communication methods to be ineffective or unreliable.
