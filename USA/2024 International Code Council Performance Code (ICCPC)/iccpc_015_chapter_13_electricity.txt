User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 12 provides requirements to ensure that use of fuel gas does not create a hazard to occupants. This primarily means that the fuel gas shall not produce unsafe levels of combustible byproducts or become a source of ignition of an unwanted fire.
Section 1201 Fuel Gas Piping and Vents
[FG] 1201.1 Objective.
To ensure that fuel gas is distributed and utilized in a safe manner.
[FG] 1201.2 Functional statement.
In buildings where fuel gas is used as an energy source, the vented and unvented gas piping systems shall be safe and adequate for their intended use.
[FG] 1201.3 Performance requirements.
[FG] 1201.3.1 General.
Gas piping systems shall be free of leaks and operated at a safe pressure appropriate to the appliances served by the system.
[FG] 1201.3.2 Isolation.
Gas piping systems shall have isolation devices that permit isolation of appliances, or isolation of the gas piping systems from the supply, for maintenance, testing, leak detection or repair.
[FG] 1201.3.3 Conveyance of products of combustion.
Vented gas appliances shall convey products of combustion directly to the exterior without affecting the operation of other gas vents.
[FG] 1201.3.4 Safety controls.
Vented gas appliances shall be provided with safety controls that prevent their operation in the event of failure of forced ventilation systems or natural draft systems.
