Chapter 14 Energy Efficiency
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 14 provides the requirements for building systems and portions of a building that impact energy use in new construction, and promotes the cost-effective use of energy.
Section 1401 Energy Efficiency
[CE] 1401.1 Objective.
To facilitate efficient use of energy.
[CE] 1401.2 Functional statement.
Buildings shall have provisions ensuring efficient use of nonrenewable energy.
[CE] 1401.3 Performance requirements.
[CE] 1401.3.1 Energy performance indices.
To provide for the efficient use of depletable energy sources, the building envelope shall be designed and constructed within stated parameters. These parameters are called the energy performance indices. These indices are the amount of energy from a depletable energy source passing through a specified building envelope area during a specified difference in internal and external temperature. These indices are based on the region of the country as well as the use of the building. Equivalent energy performance utilizing alternative energy conservation techniques is permitted. In some cases, for certain types of buildings, the local jurisdiction has the authority to choose not to specify energy performance indices.
[CE] 1401.3.2 Temperature control.
For buildings requiring a controlled temperature, the building design and construction shall take into account various factors. Normally, only insulation, types of windows and related building elements are considered when addressing energy conservation. However, to provide for the efficient use of energy, there are several other items that need to be taken into consideration, such as thermal resistance, solar radiation, air tightness and heat gain or loss from building services.
