Chapter 5 Stability
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 5 provides the requirements for the structural design of buildings and other structures. Section 501 specifies the forces for which structures need to be designed and the required performance. This chapter requires a structure to be designed for the expected forces it will be subjected to throughout its life. This is the same requirement found in Chapter 16 of the International Building Code.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IBC—General Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section 501 Structural Forces
[BS] 501.1 Objective.
To provide a desired level of structural performance when structures are subjected to the loads that are expected during construction or alteration and throughout their intended lives.
[BS] 501.2 Functional statements.
[BS] 501.2.1 Life safety and injury prevention.
Structures shall be designed and constructed to prevent injury to occupants due to loading of a structural element or system consistent with the design performance level determined in Chapter 3.
[BS] 501.2.2 Property and amenity protection.
Structures shall be designed and constructed to prevent loss of property and amenity consistent with the design performance level determined in Chapter 3.
[BS] 501.3 Performance requirements.
Performance of the structure shall be determined based on loads derived to satisfy the requirements of this section. Where the provisions of this section are not used to develop loads, loads shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 16 of the International Building Code.
[BS] 501.3.1 Stability.
Structures, or portions thereof, shall remain stable and not collapse during construction or alteration and throughout their lives.
[BS] 501.3.2 Disproportionate failure.
Structures shall be designed to sustain local damage, and the structural system as a whole shall remain stable and not be damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original local damage.
[BS] 501.3.3 Loss of amenity.
Structures, or portions thereof, shall have a low probability of causing damage or loss of amenity through excessive deformation, vibration or degradation during construction or alteration and throughout their lives.
[BS] 501.3.4 Expected loads.
Structures, or portions thereof, shall be designed and constructed taking into account expected loads, and combination of loads, associated with the event(s) magnitude(s) that would affect their performance, including, but not limited to:1.Dead loads.2.Live loads.3.Impact loads.4.Explosion loads.5.Soil and hydrostatic pressure loads.6.Flood loads (mean return period).6.1.Small: 100 years.6.2.Medium: 500 years.6.3.Large: Determined on a site-specific basis.6.4.Very Large: Determined on a site-specific basis.7.Wind loads (mean return period).7.1.Small: 300 years.7.2.Medium: 700 years.7.3.Large: 1,700 years.7.4.Very Large: 3,000 years.8.Windborne debris loads.9.Snow loads (mean return period).9.1.Small: 25 years.9.2.Medium: 50 years.9.3.Large: 100 years.9.4.Very Large: 500 years. 9.5. Snow loads shall Include but not be limited to consideration for drifting, unbalanced loads, sliding snow loads and ice damming. 10.Rain loads. See Table 501.3.4.11.Earthquake loads.11.1.Small: 43 years (mean return period).11.2.Medium: 72 years (mean return period).11.3.Large: Two-thirds of the intensity of very large loads.11.4.Very large: The Risk-Targeted Maximum Considered Earthquake defined in Chapter 21 of ASCE 7.12.Ice loads, atmospheric icing (mean return period).12.1.Small: 25 years.12.2.Medium: 50 years.12.3.Large: 100 years.12.4.Very Large: 200 years.13.Hail loads.14.Thermal loads. 15. Loads due to Tsunamis.
15.1.
Very Large: The Maximum Considered Tsunami Defined in Chapter 6 of ASCE 7.

[BS] 501.3.5 Target reliabilities.
The design of buildings and structures shall consider appropriate factors of safety to provide the target reliabilities stipulated in Chapter 1 of ASCE 7 considering:1.Effects of uncertainties resulting from construction activities.2.Variation in the properties of materials and the characteristics of the site.3.Accuracy and limitations inherent in the methods used to predict the stability of the building, load effects and capacities of members and their connections.4.Self-straining forces arising from differential settlements of foundations and from restrained dimensional changes due to temperature, moisture, shrinkage, creep and similar effects.5.Uncertainties in the determination of the expected loads. 6. The level of quality control and
quality assurance
in construction.
[BS] 501.3.6 Demolition and alteration.
The demolition or alteration of buildings and structures shall be carried out in a way that avoids the likelihood of premature collapse.
[BS] 501.3.7 Site work.
Site work, where necessary, shall be carried out to provide stability for construction on the site and avoid the likelihood of damage to adjacent property.
