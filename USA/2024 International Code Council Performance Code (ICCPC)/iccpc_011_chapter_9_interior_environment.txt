Chapter 8 Moisture
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 8 is intended to prevent moisture from adversely affecting occupant health and safety and the structural and functional performance of a building. This chapter deals with both the liquid and vapor forms of water.
Section 801 Surface Water
[BS] 801.1 Objective.
To safeguard people from injury and protect the building or other property from damage caused by surface water and to protect outfalls of drainage systems that may become contaminated from on-site hazardous material storage.
[BS] 801.2 Functional statements.
[BS] 801.2.1 Surface water hazards.
Buildings and sites shall be constructed in a way that protects people and other property from the adverse effects of surface water.
[BS] 801.2.2 Hazardous materials contamination.
Building or building sites used for the storage or use of hazardous materials shall include provisions to ensure that hazardous materials are not accidentally transported across property lines into drainage outfalls.
[BS] 801.3 Performance requirements.
[BS] 801.3.1 Removal of surface water.
Surface water shall be removed in a manner that avoids damage or nuisance to the building or other property.
[BS] 801.3.2 Contaminated water.
Surface water or water used for firefighting and other uses shall be routed so as not to transport hazardous material across property lines or into drainage outfalls.
[BS] 801.3.3 Surface water runoff.
Surface water drainage systems shall convey surface water runoff to an appropriate outfall.
[BS] 801.3.4 Blockage.
Drainage systems shall be constructed so as to avoid the likelihood of blockage.
[BS] 801.3.5 Access for cleaning.
Drainage systems shall be constructed so as to have reasonable access for cleaning.
Section 802 External Moisture
[BS] 802.1 Objective.
To safeguard people from injury and to protect the building, facilities, equipment, processes, materials, and contents from damage that could result from external moisture entering the building.
[BS] 802.2 Functional statement.
Buildings shall be constructed to provide adequate resistance to penetration by, and the accumulation of, moisture from the outside.
[BS] 802.3 Performance requirements.
[BS] 802.3.1 Water penetration.
Roofs and exterior walls shall prevent the unwanted penetration and accumulation of moisture or water that causes damage to the building, facilities, equipment, processes, materials or contents, and shall provide a means for unwanted penetration of water or moisture to dissipate.
[BS] 802.3.2 Building elements in contact with the ground.
Walls, floors and structural support elements in contact with the ground shall not absorb or transmit moisture in quantities that could cause damage to the building facilities, equipment, processes, materials or contents.
[BS] 802.3.3 Concealed spaces and cavities.
Concealed spaces and cavities in buildings shall be constructed in a way that prevents unwanted penetration and accumulation of moisture or water that causes damage to the building, facilities, equipment, processes, materials or contents, and shall provide a means for any unwanted penetration of water or moisture to dissipate without causing damage.
[BS] 802.3.4 Moisture during construction.
Excess moisture present at the completion of construction shall be capable of being dissipated without permanent damage to building elements.
Section 803 Internal Moisture
[BS] 803.1 Objective.
To safeguard people against illness or injury that could result from accumulation of internal moisture, and to protect an occupancy from damage caused by free water from another occupancy in the same building.
[BS] 803.2 Functional statement.
Buildings shall be constructed to avoid the likelihood of:1.Fungal growths or the accumulation of contaminants on linings and other building elements.2.Free water overflow penetrating to an adjoining occupancy.3.Damage to building elements being caused by the use of water.
[BS] 803.3 Performance requirements.
[BS] 803.3.1 Excess moisture removal and protection.
An adequate means shall be provided to remove excess moisture from the structure or protect it from the effects of excess moisture and condensation in all habitable spaces, bathrooms, laundries and other locations where moisture is potentially generated.
[BS] 803.3.2 Overflow.
Accidental overflow from sanitary fixtures or laundering facilities shall be constrained from penetrating another occupancy in the same building.
[BS] 803.3.3 Floor surfaces.
Floor surfaces of any space containing sanitary fixtures or laundering facilities shall be impervious to water and easily cleaned.
[BS] 803.3.4 Wall surfaces.
Wall surfaces adjacent to sanitary fixtures or laundering facilities shall be impervious to water and easily cleaned.
[BS] 803.3.5 Surfaces and building elements.
Surfaces of building elements likely to be splashed or to become contaminated in the course of the intended use of the building shall be impervious to water and easily cleaned.
[BS] 803.3.6 Water splash.
Water splash shall be prevented from penetrating behind linings or into concealed spaces.
