Chapter 18 Emergency Responder Safety
This chapter is unique because it not only attempts to bring together the major issues impacting emergency responder safety found throughout prescriptive codes but also provides added importance to this issue by making it a separate section. The prescriptive codes have always made provisions to lessen the dangers to emergency responders, firefighters in particular; however, this code takes the next step and places these concerns into a separate chapter. This does not mean that many of the provisions found elsewhere in this document do not also pertain to firefighter safety but only that specific issues related thereto are addressed in this chapter. Examples of such other provisions can be found in the chapters on egress, access and hazardous materials.This chapter was developed with the understanding that emergency response by its nature is inherently dangerous, and it is beyond the realm of possibility to remove all hazards faced by responders. However, much can be done to provide reasonable levels of safety. The scope has been limited to alleviating those hazards that are beyond what would normally be expected during an emergency. Additionally, it is vital that each jurisdiction give careful consideration to what is an acceptable risk for emergency responders and provides appropriate input during the design of the building, facilities and premises to establish the appropriate level of risk. Section 1502.2.6, requires that buildings be designed to allow firefighters to perform the necessary tasks in the event of a fire.The functional statements outlined in Items 1 through 3 of
Section 1801.2
provide the basic guidance for the user as to what general areas need to be considered when evaluating provisions for emergency responder safety. The user would first establish the required performance level in conjunction with Chapter 3 after a thorough evaluation of the potential hazards to responders. Performance requirements detailed in
Sections 1801.3.1
through
1801.3.4
list specific criteria that must be addressed after determining the magnitude of design events and while completing the hazard analysis to assure the user has achieved the appropriate level of performance and provided adequate protection for the responders depending on the hazards identified.Four distinct performance requirements are included in this chapter that specifically address responder safety and functionality. The first two specify that hazards be clearly identified to the responders. This provision can be achieved by signage, barriers or other common means or might require an extensive database system available to responders. Such information might come from the designer in the form of facility layout and description of contents. This information would, of course, be based on the severity of the hazard and the specific needs of the responding agency.The third functional statement addresses similar issues found in
Section 1502
of this code but specifically intends to prevent unexpected structural failure. It was understood when these provisions were written that it is neither economically feasible nor realistic to design and build structures and facilities in such a manner that collapse or failure could be eliminated in every instance. Considering this, language is included to indicate that failures should be as predictable as possible considering the incident severity, construction materials and methods, and incident duration. This is more clearly spelled out in Chapter 15.The final functional statement ensures that emergency responder communication needs are considered. Again, this becomes very specific to the needs of the local jurisdictions as well as the unique needs dictated by the building. This communication could be as simple as standard firefighter radios, phones and public address systems or as extensive as an in-building emergency responder communications enhancement system.Acceptable methods Construction in accordance with the International Building Code®(IBC®) and International Fire Code®(IFC®) would be deemed to comply with the requirements of
Chapter 18 . The original provisions of this chapter were written to reflect, as close as possible, what the prescriptive codes intended in terms of the protection of emergency responders. This includes minimum levels of construction, proper identification and signage of hazards and providing the ability to communicate during an emergency within the building.In terms of communication,
Section 510
of the IFC requires in-building emergency responder communication enhancements systems (ERCES) as applicable to the building and coverage provided. The IFC also triggers for existing buildings under certain circumstances. The IBC provides a trigger to evaluate the need for such systems for new construction within
Chapter 9.
