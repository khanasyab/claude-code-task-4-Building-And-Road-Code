Chapter 6 Pedestrian Circulation
Section 601 Means of Egress
These provisions provide guidance by which egress systems for buildings and facilities are designed, evaluated and maintained. The current prescriptive codes dictate a solution of standardized elements based on narrowly defined minimums and maximums. The prescriptive methodology is successful in providing safe buildings, but it is found to be a hindrance in many cases in the design of new buildings because a single solution-set usually does not fit perfectly for every situation. The prescriptive approach tends to focus code users on specific numbers and therefore causes users to lose sight of the intent.The general concepts of egress have not changed over time, nor have they changed as a result of the creation of performance codes. Safe egress continues to involve exiting the building or facility safely or relocating to a safe place, i.e., an area of refuge. A multitude of occupancy characteristics influence the decisions made on egress, ranging from an occupancy consisting of completely ambulatory, self-preservation-capable persons to an occupancy consisting of disabled, infirm or incarcerated persons.All the elements found in the current prescriptive codes were considered in this section. The terms formerly used for these elements are not necessarily found in the text. Generic terms make it easier to expand the scope as may be necessary in the future when thinking in a true performance manner. The authors of these provisions were careful to avoid existing terminology and thereby avoided preconceived notions based on past definitions. As the egress provisions are revised in the International Building Code® (IBC®), Section 601 may not need revision as the overall objectives, functional statements and performance requirements will not change. For instance, the concept of using elevators for egress was added to the 2009 IBC as an alternative to an additional stairway in very tall high-rise buildings. The International Code Council Performance Code® for Buildings and Facilities (ICCPC®) has always been able to facilitate such design strategies as long as the design could demonstrate that it met the design performance levels, objectives, functional statements and performance requirements.An effective system of egress is interdependent with provisions for accessibility, fall prevention, number of occupants, level of risk and building safety systems. Each of these issues has to be factored into acceptable solutions for egress.Public discussion of these performance provisions has focused on the use and lack of use of terms defined in the prescriptive codes. In the performance section on egress, the term “safe place” is used and the terms “public way” and “area of refuge” are not. The term “safe place” is universal, as it may refer to an exterior or interior location. Additionally, it gives the building designer the information needed that people must be conducted to a safe place.
601.1 Objective
The objective conveys the ultimate goal of the chapter. The current prescriptive codes do not clearly state an objective, and the IBC and International Fire Code®
(IFC®) commentary focus on the hazards related to fire. This code conspicuously avoids the term “fire” and focuses on the goal. There are other emergencies that may necessitate the evacuation of a building’s occupants.These provisions apply to all building occupants, including those with disabilities. The egress provisions do not cover rescue operations by emergency responders, which are specifically dealt with in Chapter 17, Emergency Access and Facilities.
601.2 Functional statement
The functional statements indicate that the building or facility must be designed, constructed and maintained to allow occupants to egress according to the design performance levels of Chapter 3. Section 1502 was revised fairly early in the development process to reflect a single performance level for life safety. A similar revision was not made to this section. Means of egress may need to be available for other incidents beyond fire, such as a hazardous materials release or an earthquake. See discussion regarding Section 1502.2 as to the reasoning for a single performance level for life safety with regard to fire.
601.3 Performance requirements
These provisions apply to both new and existing buildings and facilities where appropriate. The performance requirements are fairly intuitive and relate back to Chapter 10 of the IBC and IFC in intent. Some of the key issues are as follows: Travel distances. Number of occupants. Occupant characteristics. Identification and illumination. Safe place (area of refuge). Unobstructed path. In a performance code, numerical values will not initially be provided for travel distance or occupant load. Likewise, terminology such as “exit passageway” will not be used. A performance-based egress solution will deal with the evaluation of the hazard and the available egress time for the occupants to avoid interfacing with the hazard. Some of the prescriptive egress requirements such as exit sign location and illumination, may remain prescriptive in most performance designs.Section 601.3.6 clearly points out that regardless of when a building or facility was constructed, a suitable level of performance is still required. This aspect relates to the intent of the egress provisions in the prescriptive IFC. One of the traditional functions of fire codes has been to ensure that the egress system of a building or facility continues to function over time.In many cases, it is difficult to truly understand the hazards that exist within an existing building, and it is even more difficult to understand which changes can be the most effective. Through an analysis, the designer and the code official may find, for example, that the width of the exits is much more important than the travel distance.Also, as noted, egress is interdependent with other aspects of building functions and characteristics such as fall prevention, accessibility, hazards and characteristics of the occupants. Therefore, Section 601.3.5, relating to appropriate walking surfaces and facilities to avoid falls and injuries, was included. If surfaces and related features such as ceiling clearances are addressed for egress during an emergency, then falls and injuries related to falls should be the same or lower during nonemergency daily use.
Section 602 Accessibility
Accessibility requirements provide disabled persons with reasonable access to and use of buildings to an extent consistent with that to which people without disabilities are able to access and use buildings. This is consistent with the intent of federal statutes enacted to protect the rights of people with disabilities.This intent is implicit in all provisions of this code, whether or not the intent is specifically stated in each section. The goal of the performance code is to allow freedom of design while providing an acceptable level of accessibility throughout a building. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the user of the code to base decisions on reasonable criteria with the intent of providing equal access. Since this topic is focused on addressing civil rights and can have legal implications, designs should comply with IBC Chapter 11, ICC A117.1, federal regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendment Act, or other regulations promulgated under state disability rights statutes. This section is intended to lay out the intent of the accessibility provisions.A specific effort was made to make this section an all-encompassing section that requires accessibility to be evaluated in each part of the code where applicable. This would include accessible egress.
Section 603 Transportation Equipment
This section provides general safety guidelines for installation of elevators, dumbwaiters and escalators inside or outside buildings. These provisions include use during normal operations, use by emergency responders during emergency operations and use by maintenance personnel during activities associated with adjusting, servicing and inspecting elevators. The provisions focus on the expected loads, emergency recall for medical emergencies, firefighting and rescue operations and safety of maintenance personnel.Other provisions not directly associated with elevators, dumbwaiters or escalator equipment, such as the protection of hoistway enclosures and electrical equipment, are covered by other provisions of this code such as management of fire impact.As noted in the discussion within Section 601, the use of elevators during emergencies has evolved based on the findings in the World Trade Center study and also related to the evolving needs of society in very tall buildings. More specifically, egress based only upon the use of stairs in very tall buildings may not be practical, especially when an event would require full building evacuation. Occupants may have physical limitations preventing them from using the stairs or from walking down many flights of stairs. This includes wheelchair-bound occupants and occupants impacted by other physical limitations such as asthma, joint problems or pregnancy. The current objectives, functional statements and performance requirements accommodate the use of elevators for egress along with the egress requirements in Section 601. The concept of using elevators for egress had been formalized under certain conditions in the IBC. It should be noted that the IBC references ASME A17.7 as a viable design alternative for elevators (see Section 3008 of the IBC for elevator evacuation and Section 3001.3 for reference to ASME A17.7).Another aspect that has evolved within the codes is the concept of a Fire Service Access Elevator (FSAE). The IBC and ASME A17.1 (elevator code) currently require certain features for use by the fire service. Additionally, the IBC has more rigorous requirements for elevators for FSAE that involve a lobby with upgraded construction requirements, stairs adjacent to or a protected path to such lobbies and standpipe locations and other related requirements. This particular package of requirements is only required for buildings with occupied floors greater than 120 feet (36.6 m) above the lowest level of fire department access (see Section 3007 of the IBC).This topic is specifically addressed in the SFPE/ICC Engineering Guide—Fire Safety for Very Tall Buildings (2021).Acceptable methods Means of egress. Chapters 10 of the IBC and IFC are acceptable methods, given that they are based on the factors used in the development of the performance code.Accessibility. Chapter 11 of the IBC and ICC A117.1 would be considered the acceptable methods. Because of the controversial nature of these provisions, a prescriptive approach should be undertaken as a minimum. At the very least, the objectives, functional statements and performance requirements were drafted to capture the intent and purpose of accessibility provisions.Transportation systems. The acceptable methods for these provisions include Chapter 30 of the IBC, ASME A17.1/B44, A17.7- 2007/CSA B44.7, ASME A90.1 and ASME B20.1. Note that ASME A17.7-2007/CSA B44.7, Performance-Based Safety Code Elevators and Escalators, is actually a performance elevator standard and more directly fits within the structure of this code but, as discussed in Section 103, standards are typically not referenced in this code. This standard takes high-level performance objectives and assists in creating practical solutions. As with this code the document allows compliance with prescriptive methods as well. In fact, A17.1/CSA B44 references the standard directly. The standard has a third-party process built into the document.
