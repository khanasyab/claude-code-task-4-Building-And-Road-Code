Appendix G Cryogenic Fluids—Weight and Volume Equivalents This appendix is for information purposes and is not intended for adoption. User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix G gives the fire code official and registered design professional a ready reference tool for the conversion of the liquid weight and volume of cryogenic fluid to their corresponding volume of gas and vice versa and is a companion to the provisions of Chapter 55 of this code.
Section G101 General
G101.1 Scope.
This appendix is used to convert from liquid to gas for cryogenic fluids .
G101.2 Conversion.
Table G101.2 shall be used to determine the equivalent amounts of cryogenic fluids in either the liquid or gas phase.

For SI: 1 pound = 0.454 kg, 1 gallon = 3.785 L, 1 cubic foot = 0.02832 m3, °C = [(°F) – 32]/1.8, 1 pound per square inch atmosphere = 6.895 kPa. a.The values listed for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are “typical” values. LNG is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, and no two LNG streams have exactly the same composition.
G101.2.1 Use of the table.
To use Table G101.2, read horizontally across the line of interest. For example, to determine the number of cubic feet of gas contained in 1.0 gallon (3.785 L) of liquid argon, find 1.000 in the column entitled “Volume of Liquid at Normal Boiling Point.” Reading across the line under the column entitled “Volume of Gas at NTP” (70°F and 1 atmosphere/14.7 psia), the value of 112.45 cubic feet (3.184 m3) is found.
G101.2.2 Other quantities.
If other quantities are of interest, the numbers can be multiplied or divided to obtain the quantity of interest. For example, to determine the number of cubic feet of argon gas contained in a volume of 1,000 gallons (3785 L) of liquid argon at its normal boiling point, multiply 112.45 by 1,000 to obtain 112,450 cubic feet (3184 m3).
