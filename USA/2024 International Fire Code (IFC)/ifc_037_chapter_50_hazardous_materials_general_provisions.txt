Chapter 41 Temporary Heating and Cooking Operation
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 41 provides all requirements relative to temporary heating and cooking operations, including mobile food trucks, in a single chapter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many fire and building officials found that the code requirements surrounding temporary heating and cooking, especially in tents and canopies, were disjointed and often confusing when spread across Chapters 3,
6 and
31. In addition, some types of heating and cooking appliances were not adequately covered. This chapter is intended to facilitate consistent enforcement of temporary heating and cooking operations by making the requirements more straightforward. This chapter does not address temporary heating on construction sites as it was felt that having all requirements for fire safety during construction in the same location was necessary.
