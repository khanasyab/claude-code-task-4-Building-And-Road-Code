Chapter 34 Tire Rebuilding and Tire Storage
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 34 provides requirements that are intended to prevent or control fires and explosions associated with the remanufacture and storage of tires and tire byproducts. Additionally, the requirements are intended to minimize the impact of indoor and outdoor tire storage fires by regulating pile volume and location, segregating the various operations, providing for fire department access and a water supply, and controlling ignition sources.
Section 3401 General
CDP
3401.1 Scope.
CDP
Tire rebuilding plants, tire storage and tire byproduct facilities shall comply with this chapter, other applicable requirements of this code and NFPA 13. Tire storage in buildings shall also comply with Chapter 32.
3401.2 Permit required.
CDP
Permits shall be required as set forth in Section 105.5.
Section 3402 Definitions
CDP
3402.1 Terms defined in Chapter 2.

Words and terms used in this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 shall have the meanings ascribed to them as defined therein.
Section 3403 Tire Rebuilding
3403.1 Construction.
Tire rebuilding plants shall comply with the requirements of the International Building Code, as to construction, separation from other buildings or other portions of the same building, and protection.
3403.2 Location.
Buffing operations shall be located in a room separated from the remainder of the building housing the tire rebuilding or tire recapping operations by a 1-hour fire barrier. Exception: Buffing operations are not required to be separated where all of the following conditions are met:1. Buffing operations are equipped with an approved continuous automatic water-spray system directed at the point of cutting action.2. Buffing machines are connected to particle-collecting systems providing a minimum air movement of 1,500 cubic feet per minute (cfm) (0.71 m3/s) in volume and 4,500 feet per minute (fpm) (23 m/s) in-line velocity.3. The collecting system shall discharge the rubber particles to an approved outdoor noncombustible or fire-resistant container that is emptied at frequent intervals to prevent overflow.
3403.3 Cleaning.
The buffing area shall be cleaned at frequent intervals to prevent the accumulation of rubber particles.
3403.4 Spray rooms and booths.
Each spray room or spray booth where flammable or combustible solvents are applied, shall comply with Chapter 24.
