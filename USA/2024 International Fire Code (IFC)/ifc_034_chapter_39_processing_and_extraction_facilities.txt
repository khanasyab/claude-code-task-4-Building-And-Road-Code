Chapter 38 Higher Education Laboratories
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 38 addresses the unique needs of laboratories in higher education institutions. These academic institutions often have chemistry, biology, medical, engineering and other laboratories where hazardous materials are used. This chapter addresses both new and existing buildings and new and existing laboratories. Applying the general hazardous material provisions has been difficult because of the way these laboratories operate. Often there are many small laboratories with very small quantities of hazardous materials that individually do not exceed the maximum allowable quantities (MAQs). In aggregate, the quantities will exceed the MAQs and could result in the need for a Group H occupancy classification. However, it is believed that the lower density of hazardous materials often mitigates the overall risk. This chapter also addresses the use of certain materials typically prohibited for existing buildings not protected throughout with a sprinkler system. These allowances come with certain safety measures such as the use of storage cabinets and fume hoods. Note that Section 428 of the International Building Code©addresses the construction requirements found in this chapter for laboratory suites.
