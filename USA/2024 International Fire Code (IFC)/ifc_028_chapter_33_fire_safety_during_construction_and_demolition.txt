Chapter 32 High-Piled Combustible Storage
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 32 provides guidance for reasonable protection of life from hazards associated with the storage of combustible materials in closely packed piles or on pallets, in racks or on shelves where the top of storage is greater than 12 feet in height, or 6 feet for high-hazard commodities. It provides requirements for identifying various classes of commodities; and general fire and life safety features including storage arrangements, smoke and heat venting, fire department access and housekeeping and maintenance. This chapter attempts to define the potential fire severity and, in turn, determine fire and life safety protection measures needed to control and in some cases suppress a potential fire. This chapter does not cover miscellaneous combustible material storage as regulated in Section 315.
Section 3201 General

Section 3203 Commodity Classification
3203.1 Classification of commodities.
Commodities shall be classified as Class I, II, III, IV or high hazard in accordance with Sections 3203.2 through 3203.10.3. Materials listed within each commodity classification are assumed to be unmodified for improved combustibility characteristics. Use of flame-retarding modifiers or the physical form of the material could change the classification.
3203.2 Class I commodities.
Class I commodities are noncombustible products in ordinary corrugated cartons with or without single-thickness dividers, or in ordinary paper wrappings with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9 .
3203.3 Class II commodities.
Class II commodities are Class I products in slatted wooden crates, solid wooden boxes, multiple-thickness paperboard cartons or equivalent combustible packaging material with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.
3203.4 Class III commodities.
Class III commodities are products of wood, paper, natural fiber cloth, or Group C plastics or products thereof, with or without wood pallets. The amount of Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.
3203.5 Class IV commodities.
Class IV commodities are Class I, II or III products containing Group A plastics in ordinary corrugated cartons; Class I, II and III products with Group A plastic packaging; Group B plastics; and free-flowing Group A plastics with or without wood pallets. The total amount of nonfree-flowing Group A plastics shall be limited in accordance with Section 3203.9.
3203.6 High-hazard commodities.
High-hazard commodities are products presenting special fire hazards beyond those of Class I, II, III or IV. Group A plastics not otherwise classified are included in this class.
3203.7 Classification of plastics.
Plastics shall be designated as Group A, B or C in accordance with Sections 3203.7.1 through
3203.7.3.
3203.7.1 Group A plastics.
Group A plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion that is much higher than that of ordinary combustibles, and a burning rate higher than that of Group B plastics.
3203.7.2 Group B plastics.
Group B plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate higher than that of ordinary combustibles, but not as high as those of Group A plastics.
3203.7.3 Group C plastics.
Group C plastics are plastic materials having a heat of combustion and a burning rate similar to those of ordinary combustibles.
3203.8 Examples of commodity classification.
Table 3203.8 shall be used to determine the commodity classification for various products and materials. Products not found in the list shall be classified based on the classification descriptions in Sections 3203.2 through 3203.6 and the products they most nearly represent in Table 3203.8. Table 3203.8 considers the product and the packaging if listed with the item. Products with additional packaging consisting of Group A plastics shall be classified in accordance with Section 3203.9.The commodity classifications are based on products with, or without, wood pallets. Where plastic pallets are used, the commodity classification shall be modified in accordance with Section 3203.10.
