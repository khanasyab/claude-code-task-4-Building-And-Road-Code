Appendix I Fire Protection Systems—Noncompliant Conditions The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction. User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix I, which was developed by the ICC Hazard Abatement in Existing Buildings Committee, is intended to provide the fire code official with a list of conditions that are readily identifiable by the inspector during the course of an inspection utilizing this code. The specific conditions identified in this appendix are primarily derived from applicable NFPA standards and pose a hazard to the proper operation of the respective systems. While these do not represent all of the conditions that pose a hazard or otherwise may impair the proper operation of fire protection systems, their identification in this adoptable appendix will provide a more direct path for enforcement by the fire code official. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
Section I101 Noncompliant Conditions
I101.1 General.
This appendix is intended to identify conditions that can occur where fire protection systems are not properly maintained or components have been damaged. This appendix is not intended to provide comprehensive inspection, testing and maintenance requirements, which are found in NFPA 10, NFPA 25 and NFPA 72. Rather, it is intended to identify problems that are readily observable during fire inspections.
I101.2 Impaired conditions requiring immediate action.
INSIGHTS
