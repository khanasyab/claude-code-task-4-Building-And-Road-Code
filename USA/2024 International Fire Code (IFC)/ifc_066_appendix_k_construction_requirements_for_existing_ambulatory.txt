Appendix J Building Information Sign
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix J provides design, installation and maintenance requirements for a Building Information Sign (BIS), a fire service tool to be utilized in the crucial, initial response of firefighters to a structure fire. The BIS placard is designed to be utilized within the initial response time frame of an incident to assist firefighters in their tactical sizing up of a situation as soon as possible after arrival on the scene of a fire emergency. The BIS design is in the shape of a fire service Maltese Cross and includes five spaces (the four wings plus the centerpiece of the cross symbol) in which information is placed about the tactical considerations of construction type and hourly rating, fire protection systems, occupancy type, content hazards and special features that could affect tactical decisions and operations. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
