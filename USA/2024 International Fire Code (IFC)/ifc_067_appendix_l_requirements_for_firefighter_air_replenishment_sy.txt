Appendix K Construction Requirements for Existing Ambulatory Care Facilities
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix K was created with the intent to provide jurisdictions with an option for assessing minimum fire and life safety requirements for buildings containing ambulatory care facilities. While this appendix is written with the intent to apply retroactive minimum standards, it is recognized that the ambulatory care requirements are relatively recent additions to the International Building Code®. For that reason, these requirements are presented as an appendix so that the adopting authority can exercise judgment in the adoption and application of this section. This appendix would also be useful for those local and state jurisdictions that are specifically focused on ensuring the safety of existing ambulatory care facilities by providing minimum criteria that could be used to bring older facilities into compliance with the current standards at the discretion of the adopting jurisdiction. The technical requirements are based on the current International Building Code language, which is consistent with the overall concept of the current federal requirements. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
