User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 56 prescribes minimum requirements for the safe manufacture, storage, handling and use of explosives, ammunition and blasting agents for commercial and industrial occupancies. These provisions are intended to protect the general public, emergency responders and individuals who handle explosives. It also regulates the manufacturing, retail sale, display and wholesale distribution of fireworks; establishes the requirements for obtaining approval to manufacture, store, sell, discharge or conduct a public display; and references national standards for regulations governing manufacture, storage and public displays.

The required distance is the greater of the two. Where the Division 1.1 requirements are controlling and the TNT equivalence of the 1.3 is known, the TNT equivalent weight of the 1.3 items shall be allowed to be added to the total explosive weight of Division 1.1 items to determine the net explosive weight for Division 1.1 distance determination. See Table 5604.5.2(1) ,
5604.5.2(2) or
5605.3, as appropriate.3.Where Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 explosives are located in the same site, determine the distances for the total quantity considered first as 1.1, next as 1.2 and finally as 1.3. The required distance is the greatest of the three. As allowed by Items 1 and 2, TNT equivalent weights for 1.2 and 1.3 items are allowed to be used to determine the net weight of explosives for Division 1.1 distance determination. Table 5604.5.2(1) or
5605.3 shall be used where TNT equivalency is used to establish the net explosive weight.4.For composite pyrotechnic items Division 1.1 and Division 1.3, the sum of the net weights of the pyrotechnic composition and the explosives involved shall be used. See Tables 5604.5.2(1) and
5604.5.2(2).
