User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 40 provides specific requirements for the storage of distilled spirits and wines. In accordance with Section 307.1.1 of the International Building Code®, these occupancies are not classified as a Group H occupancy. Instead, as listed in Sections 311.2 and 311.3 of the International Building Code, the storage of beverages that contain up to and including 20 percent alcohol are classified as a Group S-2 occupancy, and those that contain over 20 percent alcohol content are classified as a Group S-1 occupancy. Note that those that are classified as a Group S-1 occupancy are required to be provided with an automatic sprinkler system throughout the Group S-1 fire area, regardless of size, in accordance with Section 903.
