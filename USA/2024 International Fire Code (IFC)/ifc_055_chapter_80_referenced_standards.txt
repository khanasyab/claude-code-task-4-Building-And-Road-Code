Chapter 67 Water-Reactive Solids and Liquids
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 67 addresses the hazards associated with water-reactive materials that are solid or liquid at normal temperatures and pressures. In addition to their water reactivity, these materials may pose a wide range of other hazards, such as toxicity, flammability, corrosiveness or oxidizing potential. This chapter addresses only those materials whose primary hazard is water reactivity. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all hazards. Strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter, along with proper housekeeping and storage arrangements, helps to reduce the exposure to hazards associated with water-reactive materials in a fire or other emergency.
Section 6701 General
