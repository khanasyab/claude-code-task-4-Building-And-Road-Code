Chapter 10 Means of Egress
User note:
About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. This chapter addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Sections 1003 through 1031 are duplicated text from Chapter 10 of the International Building Code®; however, the International Fire Code®contains an additional Section 1032 on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings. Retroactive minimum means of egress requirements for existing buildings are found in Chapter 11.

[BE] 1004.5.1 Increased occupant load.
The occupant load permitted in any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from that number established for the occupancies in
Table 1004.5, provided that all other requirements of the code are met based on such modified number and the occupant load does not exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m2) of occupiable floor space. Where required by the fire code official, an approved aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where required by the fire code official, such diagram shall be posted.
[BE] 1004.6 Fixed seating.
For areas having fixed seats and aisles, the occupant load shall be determined by the number of fixed seats installed therein. The occupant load for areas in which fixed seating is not installed, such as waiting spaces, shall be determined in accordance with
Section 1004.5 and added to the number of fixed seats.The occupant load of wheelchair spaces and the associated companion seat shall be based on one occupant for each wheelchair space and one occupant for the associated companion seat provided in accordance with Section 1109.2.3 of the International Building Code.For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall be not less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length.The occupant load of seating booths shall be based on one person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth seat length measured at the backrest of the seating booth.
[BE] 1004.7 Outdoor areas.
CDP
Yards, patios, occupiable roofs, courts and similar outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants shall be provided with means of egress as required by this chapter. The occupant load of such outdoor areas shall be assigned by the fire code official in accordance with the anticipated use. Where outdoor areas are to be used by persons in addition to the occupants of the building, and the path of egress travel from the outdoor areas passes through the building, means of egress requirements for the building shall be based on the sum of the occupant loads of the building plus the outdoor areas.Exceptions: 1.Outdoor areas used exclusively for service of the building need only have one means of egress.2.Both outdoor areas associated with Group R-3 and individual dwelling units of Group R-2.
[BE] 1004.8 Concentrated business use areas.
CDP
INSIGHTS
The occupant load factor for concentrated business use shall be applied to telephone call centers, trading floors, electronic data entry centers and similar business use areas with a higher density of occupants than would normally be expected in a typical business occupancy environment. Where approved by the code official, the occupant load for concentrated business use areas shall be the actual occupant load, but not less than one occupant per 50 square feet (4.65 m2) of gross occupiable floor space. INSIGHTS (3)
[BE] 1004.9 Posting of occupant load.
Every room or space that is an assembly occupancy shall have the occupant load of the room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the main exit or exit access doorway from the room or space, for the intended configurations.

Sections 1005.3.1 and
1005.3.2.
[BE] 1005.3.1 Stairways.
The capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.3 inch (7.6 mm) per occupant. Where stairways serve more than one story, only the occupant load of each story considered individually shall be used in calculating the required capacity of the stairways serving that story.Exceptions: 1.For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such stairways by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5.1 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with
Section 903.3.1.1 or
903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with
Section 907.5.2.2.2.Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in
Table 1030.6.2 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with
Section 909.3.Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity factors in
Section 1030.6.3 indicated for stepped aisles for exit access or exit stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.
[BE] 1005.3.2 Other egress components.
The capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.2 inch (5.1 mm) per occupant.Exceptions: 1.For other than Group H and I-2 occupancies, the capacity, in inches, of means of egress components other than stairways shall be calculated by multiplying the occupant load served by such component by a means of egress capacity factor of 0.15 inch (3.8 mm) per occupant in buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with
Section 903.3.1.1 or
903.3.1.2 and an emergency voice/alarm communication system in accordance with
Section 907.5.2.2.2.Facilities with smoke-protected assembly seating shall be permitted to use the capacity factors in Table 1030.6.2 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is provided with a smoke control system complying with Section 909.3.Facilities with open-air assembly seating shall be permitted to the capacity factors in
Section 1030.6.3 indicated for level or ramped aisles for means of egress components other than stairways where the entire path for means of egress from the seating to the exit discharge is open to the outdoors.
[BE] 1005.4 Continuity.
The minimum width or required capacity of the means of egress required from any story of a building shall not be reduced along the path of egress travel until arrival at the public way.
[BE] 1005.5 Distribution of minimum width and required capacity.
INSIGHTS
Where more than one exit, or access to more than one exit, is required, the means of egress shall be configured such that the loss of any one exit, or access to one exit, shall not reduce the available capacity or width to less than 50 percent of the required capacity or width. INSIGHTS (1)
[BE] 1005.6 Egress convergence.
INSIGHTS
Where the means of egress from stories above and below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence shall be not less than the largest minimum width or the sum of the required capacities for the stairways or ramps serving the two adjacent stories, whichever is larger. INSIGHTS (1)
[BE] 1005.7 Encroachment.
Encroachments into the required means of egress width shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section.
[BE] 1005.7.1 Doors.
