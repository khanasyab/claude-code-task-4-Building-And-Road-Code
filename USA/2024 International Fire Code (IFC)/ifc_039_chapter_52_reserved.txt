Chapter 51 Aerosols
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 51 provides requirements for the prevention, control and extinguishment of fires and explosions in facilities where retail aerosol products are displayed or stored. It is concerned with both life safety and property protection from a fire; however, historically, aerosol product fires have caused property loss more frequently than loss of life. Requirements for storing aerosol products are dependent on the level of aerosol product, level of sprinkler protection, type of storage condition and quantity of aerosol products.
