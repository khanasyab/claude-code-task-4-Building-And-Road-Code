Chapter 57 Flammable and Combustible Liquids
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 57 provides requirements that are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires involving the storage, handling, use or transportation of flammable and combustible liquids. Adherence to these practices may also limit damage in the event of an accidental fire involving these materials. These liquids are used for fuel, lubricants, cleaners, solvents, medicine and even drinking. The danger associated with flammable and combustible liquids is that the vapors from these liquids, when combined with air in their flammable range, will burn or explode at temperatures near normal living and working environments. The regulations herein are intended to prevent the flammable and combustible liquids from being ignited and provide mitigating requirements for when a fire does occur.
