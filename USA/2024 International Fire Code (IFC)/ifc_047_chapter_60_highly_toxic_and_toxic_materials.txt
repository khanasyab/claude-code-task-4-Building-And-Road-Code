Chapter 59 Flammable Solids
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 59 addresses general requirements for storage and handling of flammable solids, especially magnesium; however, it is important to note that several other solid materials, including such metals as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, calcium, zinc, sodium, lithium, potassium, sodium/potassium alloys, uranium, thorium and plutonium, can be explosion hazards under the right conditions. Some of these metals are almost exclusively laboratory materials but because of where they are used, fire service personnel must be trained to handle emergency situations. Because uranium, thorium and plutonium are also radioactive materials, they pose more specialized problems for fire service personnel.
