Appendix M High-Rise Buildings—Retroactive Automatic Sprinkler Requirement
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix M was created with the intent to provide an option for adoption by jurisdictions that choose to require existing high-rise buildings to be retrofitted with automatic sprinklers. Modern fire and building codes require complete automatic fire sprinkler protection and a variety of other safety features in new high-rise construction. Many older high-rise buildings lack automatic sprinkler protection and other basic fire protection features necessary to protect the occupants, emergency responders and the structure itself. Without complete automatic sprinkler protection, fire departments cannot provide the level of protection that high-rise buildings demand. Existing high-rise buildings that are not protected with automatic sprinklers represent a significant hazard to occupants and firefighters, and can significantly impact a community’s infrastructure and economic viability in the event of a fire loss. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
Section M101 Scope
M101.1 Scope.
An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed in all existing high-rise buildings in accordance with the requirements and compliance schedule of this appendix.
Section M102 Where Required

Section M103 Compliance
M103.1 Compliance schedule.
Building owners shall file a compliance schedule with the fire code official not later than 365 days after receipt of a written notice of violation. The compliance schedule shall not exceed 12 years for an automatic sprinkler system retrofit.
