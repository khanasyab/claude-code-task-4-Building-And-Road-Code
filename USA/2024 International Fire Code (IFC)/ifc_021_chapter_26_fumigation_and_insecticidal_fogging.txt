Chapter 25 Fruit and Crop Ripening
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 25 provides guidance that is intended to reduce the likelihood of explosions resulting from improper use or handling of ethylene gas used for crop ripening and coloring processes. This is accomplished by regulating ethylene gas generation, regulating storage and distribution systems and controlling ignition sources. Design and construction of facilities for fruit and crop ripening are regulated by the International Building Code®to reduce the impact of potential accidents to people and buildings.
Section 2501 General
CDP
2501.1 Scope.
CDP
Ripening processes where ethylene gas is introduced into a room to promote the ripening of fruits, vegetables and other crops shall comply with this chapter.Exception: Mixtures of ethylene and one or more inert gases in concentrations that prevent the gas from reaching greater than 25 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) when released to the atmosphere.
2501.2 Permits.
CDP
Permits shall be required as set forth in Section 105.5.
2501.3 Ethylene generators.
CDP
Approved ethylene generators shall be operated and maintained in accordance with Section 2506.
Section 2502 Definitions
CDP
2502.1 Terms defined in Chapter 2.
CDP
Words and terms used in this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 shall have the meanings ascribed to them as defined therein.
Section 2503 Ethylene Gas
2503.1 Location.
Ethylene gas shall be discharged only into approved rooms or enclosures designed and constructed for this purpose.
2503.2 Dispensing.
Valves controlling discharge of ethylene shall provide positive and fail-closed control of flow and shall be set to limit the concentration of gas in air below 1,000 parts per million (ppm).
Section 2504 Sources of Ignition
2504.1 Ignition prevention.
Sources of ignition shall be controlled or protected in accordance with this section and Chapter 3.
2504.2 Electrical wiring and equipment.
Electrical wiring and equipment, including luminaires, shall be approved for use in Class I, Division 2, Group C hazardous (classified) locations.
2504.3 Static electricity.
Containers, piping and equipment used to dispense ethylene shall be bonded and grounded to prevent the discharge of static sparks or arcs.
2504.4 Lighting.
Lighting shall be by approved electric lamps or luminaires only.
2504.5 Heating.
Heating shall be by indirect means utilizing low-pressure steam, hot water or warm air.Exception: Electric or fuel-fired heaters approved for use in hazardous (classified) locations and that are installed and operated in accordance with the applicable provisions of NFPA 70, the International Mechanical Code or the International Fuel Gas Code.
Section 2505 Combustible Waste
2505.1 Housekeeping.
Empty boxes, cartons, pallets and other combustible waste shall be removed from ripening rooms or enclosures and disposed of at regular intervals in accordance with Chapter 3.
Section 2506 Ethylene Generators
CDP
2506.1 Ethylene generators.
CDP
Ethylene generators shall be listed and labeled by an approved testing laboratory, approved by the fire code official and used only in approved rooms in accordance with the ethylene generator manufacturer’s instructions. The listing evaluation shall include documentation that the concentration of ethylene gas does not exceed 25 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL).
2506.2 Ethylene generator rooms.
CDP
Ethylene generators shall be used in rooms having a volume of not less than 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3). Rooms shall have air circulation to ensure even distribution of ethylene gas and shall be free from sparks, open flames or other ignition sources.
Section 2507 Warning Signs
2507.1 Where required.
Approved warning signs indicating the danger involved and necessary precautions shall be posted on all doors and entrances to the premises.
