Chapter 8 Interior Finish, Decorative Materials and Furnishings
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 8 provides requirements for interior finishes, decorative materials and furnishings in new and existing buildings so that they do not significantly add to or create fire hazards in buildings. The provisions tend to focus on occupancies with specific risk characteristics, such as vulnerability of occupants, density of occupants, lack of familiarity with the building and societal expectations of importance. This chapter is consistent with Chapter 8 of the International Building Code®, which regulates the interior finishes and decorative materials of new buildings.
