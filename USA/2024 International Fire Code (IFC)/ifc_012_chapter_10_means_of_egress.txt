Chapter 9 Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active fire protection equipment systems to perform the functions of detecting a fire, alerting the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency, mass notification, gas detection, controlling smoke and controlling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building because these are the factors that most affect firefighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Building Code®; however, this chapter also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in the International Building Code. In addition, the special fire protection system requirements based on use and occupancy found in Chapter 4 of the International Building Code are duplicated in this chapter as a user convenience.
Section 901 General
CDP
901.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall specify where fire protection and life safety systems are required and shall apply to the design, installation, inspection, operation, testing and maintenance of all fire protection and life safety systems.
901.2 Construction documents.
The fire code official shall have the authority to require construction documents and calculations for all fire protection and life safety systems and to require permits be issued for the installation, rehabilitation or modification of any fire protection and life safety systems. Construction documents for fire protection and life safety systems shall be submitted for review and approval prior to system installation.
901.2.1 Statement of compliance.
Before requesting final approval of the installation, where required by the fire code official, the installing contractor shall furnish a written statement to the fire code official that the subject fire protection or life safety system has been installed in accordance with approved plans and has been tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications and the appropriate installation standard. Any deviations from the design standards shall be noted and copies of the approvals for such deviations shall be attached to the written statement.
901.3 Permits.
CDP
Permits shall be required as set forth in Sections 105.5 and 105.6.
901.4 Fire protection and life safety systems.

Where buildings, or portions thereof, are divided into fire areas so as not to exceed the limits established for requiring a fire protection system in accordance with this chapter, such fire areas shall be separated by fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the International Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the International Building Code, or both, having a fire-resistance rating of not less than that determined in accordance with Section 707.3.10 of the International Building Code.
901.4.5 Additional fire protection systems.
In occupancies of a hazardous nature, where special hazards exist in addition to the normal hazards of the occupancy, or where the fire code official determines that access for fire apparatus is unduly difficult, the fire code official shall have the authority to require additional safeguards and fire protection systems. Fire protection and life safety systems required under this section shall be installed in accordance with this code and the applicable referenced standards.

CDP
Standby or emergency power shall be provided or the gas detection system shall initiate a trouble signal at an approved location if the power supply is interrupted.
916.6 Sensor locations.
CDP
Sensors shall be installed in approved locations where leaking gases are expected to accumulate.
916.7 Gas sampling.
CDP
Gas sampling shall be performed continuously. Sample analysis shall be processed immediately after sampling, except as follows:1.For HPM gases, sample analysis shall be performed at intervals not exceeding 30 minutes.2.For toxic gases that are not HPM, sample analysis shall be performed at intervals not exceeding 5 minutes, in accordance with Section 6004.2.2.7.3.Where a less frequent or delayed sampling interval is approved .
916.8 System activation.
CDP
A gas detection alarm shall be initiated where any sensor detects a concentration of gas exceeding the following thresholds:1.For flammable gases, a gas concentration exceeding 25 percent of the lower flammability limit (LFL).2.For nonflammable gases, a gas concentration exceeding one-half of the IDLH, unless a different threshold is specified by the section of this code requiring a gas detection system. Upon activation of a gas detection alarm, alarm signals or other required responses shall be as specified by the section of this code requiring a gas detection system. Audible and visible alarm signals associated with a gas detection alarm shall be distinct from fire alarm and carbon monoxide alarm signals.
