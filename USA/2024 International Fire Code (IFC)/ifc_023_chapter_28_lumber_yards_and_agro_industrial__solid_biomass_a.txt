Chapter 27 Semiconductor Fabrication Facilities
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 27 provides requirements that are intended to control hazards associated with the manufacture of electrical circuit boards or microchips, commonly called semiconductors. Though the finished product possesses no unusual hazards, materials commonly associated with semiconductor manufacturing are often quite hazardous and include flammable liquids, pyrophoric and flammable gases, toxic substances and corrosives. The requirements of this chapter are concerned with both life safety and property protection. However, the fire code official should recognize that the risk of extraordinary property damages is far more common than the risk of personal injuries from fire. Section 415.11 of the International Building Code®also addresses these facilities that are classified as Group H-5 occupancies.
