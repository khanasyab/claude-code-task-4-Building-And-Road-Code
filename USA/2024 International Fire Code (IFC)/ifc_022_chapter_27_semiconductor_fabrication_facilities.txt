Chapter 26 Fumigation and Insecticidal Fogging
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 26 regulates fumigation and insecticidal fogging operations that use toxic pesticide chemicals to kill insects, rodents and other vermin. Fumigants and insecticidal fogging agents pose little hazard if properly applied; however, the inherent toxicity of all these agents and the potential flammability of some make special precautions necessary when they are used. Requirements of this chapter are intended to protect both the public and firefighters from hazards associated with these products.
Section 2601 General
2601.1 Scope.
Fumigation and insecticidal fogging operations within buildings, structures and spaces shall comply with this chapter.

2603.2.1 Electricity.
Electricity in any part of the building, structure or space where operation of switches or electrical devices, equipment or systems could serve as a source of ignition shall be shut off.Exception: Circulating fans that have been specifically designed for utilization in hazardous atmospheres and installed in accordance with NFPA 70.
2603.2.2 Electronic devices.
Electronic devices, including portable equipment and cellular phones, shall be shut off. Telephone lines shall be disconnected from telephones.
2603.2.3 Duration.
Sources of ignition shall be shut off during the fumigation activity and remain shut off until the ventilation required in Section 2603.6 is completed.
2603.3 Notification.

The fire code official and fire chief shall be notified in writing not less than 48 hours before the building, structure or space is to be closed in connection with the utilization of any toxic or flammable fumigant. Notification shall give the location of the enclosed space to be fumigated or fogged, the occupancy, the fumigants or insecticides to be utilized, the person or persons responsible for the operation, and the date and time at which the operation will begin. Written notice of any fumigation or insecticidal fogging operation shall be given to all affected occupants of the building, structure or space in which such operations are to be conducted with sufficient advance notice to allow the occupants to evacuate the building, structure or space. Such notice shall inform the occupants as to the purposes, anticipated duration and hazards associated with the fumigation or insecticidal fogging operation.
2603.3.1 Warning signs.
CDP
Approved warning signs indicating the danger, type of chemical involved and necessary precautions shall be posted on all doors and entrances to the affected building, structure or space and on all gangplanks and ladders from the deck, pier or land to a ship.

Sufficient watchers shall be provided to prevent persons from entering the enclosed space under fumigation without being observed.
2603.3.4 Evacuation during fumigation.
CDP
Occupants of the building, structure or space to be fumigated, except the personnel conducting the fumigation, shall be evacuated from such building, structure or space prior to commencing fumigation operations.

2603.4 Insecticidal fogging liquids.
Insecticidal fogging liquids with a flash point below 100°F (38°C) shall not be utilized.
2603.5 Sealing of buildings, structures and spaces.
Paper and other similar materials that do not meet the flame propagation performance criteria of Test Method 1 or Test Method 2, as appropriate, of NFPA 701 shall not be used to wrap or cover a building, structure or space in excess of that required for the sealing of cracks, casements and similar openings.
2603.5.1 Maintenance of openings.
