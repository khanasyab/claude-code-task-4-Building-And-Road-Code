Appendix C Fire Hydrant Locations and Distribution
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix C focuses on the location and spacing of fire hydrants, which is important to the success of firefighting operations. The with determining the spacing of fire hydrants is that every situation is unique and has unique challenges. Finding one methodology for determining hydrant spacing is difficult. This particular appendix gives one methodology based on the required fire flow that fire departments can work with to set a policy for hydrant distribution around new buildings and facilities in conjunction with Section 507.5. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
Section C101 General
C101.1 Scope.
In addition to the requirements of Section 507.5.1, fire hydrants shall be provided in accordance with this appendix for the protection of buildings, or portions of buildings, hereafter constructed or moved into the jurisdiction.
Section C102 Number of Fire Hydrants
C102.1 Minimum number of fire hydrants for a building
The number of fire hydrants available to a building shall be not less than the minimum specified in Table C102.1.

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 gallon per minute = 3.785 L/m. a.Reduce by 100 feet for dead-end streets or roads.b.Where streets are provided with median dividers that cannot be crossed by firefighters pulling hose lines, or where arterial streets are provided with four or more traffic lanes and have a traffic count of more than 30,000 vehicles per day, hydrant spacing shall average 500 feet on each side of the street and be arranged on an alternating basis.c.Where new water mains are extended along streets where hydrants are not needed for protection of structures or similar fire problems, fire hydrants shall be provided at spacing not to exceed 1,000 feet to provide for transportation hazards.d.Reduce by 50 feet for dead-end streets or roads.e.One hydrant for each 1,000 gallons per minute or fraction thereof.f.A 50 percent spacing increase shall be permitted where the building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 of the International Fire Code.g.A 25 percent spacing increase shall be permitted where the building is equipped throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.2 or
903.3.1.3 of the International Fire Code or Section P2904 of the International Residential Code.h.The fire code official is authorized to modify the location, number and distribution of fire hydrants based on site-specific constraints and hazards.
Section C103 Fire Hydrant Spacing
C103.1 Hydrant spacing.
Fire apparatus access roads and public streets providing required access to buildings in accordance with Section 503 shall be provided with one or more fire hydrants, as determined by Section C102.1. Where more than one fire hydrant is required, the distance between required fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Sections C103.2 and C103.3.
C103.2 Average spacing.
The average spacing between fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Table C102.1.Exception: The average spacing shall be permitted to be increased by 10 percent where existing fire hydrants provide all or a portion of the required number of fire hydrants.
C103.3 Maximum spacing.
The maximum spacing between fire hydrants shall be in accordance with Table C102.1.
Section C104 Consideration of Existing Fire Hydrants
C104.1 Existing fire hydrants.
Existing fire hydrants on public streets are allowed to be considered as available to meet the requirements of Sections C102 and C103. Existing fire hydrants on adjacent properties are allowed to be considered as available to meet the requirements of Sections C102 and C103 provided that a fire apparatus access road extends between properties and that an easement is established to prevent obstruction of such roads.
Section C105 Referenced Standard
C105.1 General.
See Table C105.1 for standards that are referenced in various sections of this appendix. Standards are listed by the standard identification with the effective date, standard title, and the section or sections of this appendix that reference the standard.
