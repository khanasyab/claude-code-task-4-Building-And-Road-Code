Chapter 64 Pyrophoric Materials
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 64 regulates the hazards associated with pyrophoric materials, which are capable of spontaneously igniting in the air at or below a temperature of 130°F (54°C). Many pyrophoric materials also pose severe flammability or reactivity hazards. This chapter addresses only the hazards associated with pyrophoric materials. Materials that pose multiple hazards must conform to the requirements of this code with respect to all hazards.
Section 6401 General
CDP
6401.1 Scope.
CDP
The storage and use of pyrophoric materials shall be in accordance with this chapter. Compressed gases shall also comply with Chapter 53.
6401.2 Permits.
CDP
Permits shall be required as set forth in Section 105.5.
Section 6402 Definition
CDP
6402.1 Definition.
CDP
The following term is defined in Chapter 2:PYROPHORIC.
Section 6403 General Requirements
6403.1 Quantities not exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area.
The storage and use of pyrophoric materials in amounts not exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area indicated in Section 5003.1 shall be in accordance with Sections 5001, 5003, 6401 and 6403.
6403.1.1 Emergency shutoff.
Compressed gas systems conveying pyrophoric gases shall be provided with approved manual or automatic emergency shutoff valves that can be activated at each point of use and at each source.
6403.1.1.1 Shutoff at source.
An automatic emergency shutoff valve shall be installed on supply piping at the cylinder or bulk source. The shutoff valve shall be operated by a remotely located manually activated shutdown control located not less than 15 feet (4572 mm) from the source of supply. Manual or automatic cylinder valves are allowed to be used as the required emergency shutoff valve where the source of supply is limited to unmanifolded cylinder sources.
6403.1.1.2 Shutoff at point of use.
A manual or automatic emergency shutoff valve shall be installed on the supply piping at the point of use or at a point where the equipment using the gas is connected to the supply system.
6403.2 Quantities exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area.
The storage and use of pyrophoric materials in amounts exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area indicated in Section 5003.1 shall be in accordance with Chapter 50 and this chapter.
Section 6404 Storage
6404.1 Indoor storage.
Indoor storage of pyrophoric materials in amounts exceeding the maximum allowable quantity per control area indicated in Table 5003.1.1(1) shall be in accordance with Sections 5001, 5003 and 5004 and this chapter.The storage of silane gas, and gas mixtures with a silane concentration of 1.37 percent or more by volume, shall be in accordance with ANSI/CGA G-13.
6404.1.1 Liquid-tight floor.
In addition to the requirements of Section 5004.12, floors of storage areas containing pyrophoric liquids shall be of liquid-tight construction.
6404.1.2 Pyrophoric solids and liquids.
Storage of pyrophoric solids and liquids shall be limited to a maximum area of 100 square feet (9.3 m2) per pile. Storage shall not exceed 5 feet (1524 mm) in height. Individual containers shall not be stacked.Aisles between storage piles shall be not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) in width.Individual tanks or containers shall not exceed 500 gallons (1893 L) in capacity.
6404.1.3 Pyrophoric gases.
Storage of pyrophoric gases shall be in detached buildings where required by Section 5003.8.2.
6404.1.4 Separation from incompatible materials.
CDP
In addition to the requirements of Section 5003.9.8, indoor storage of pyrophoric materials shall be isolated from incompatible hazardous materials by 1-hour fire barriers with openings protected in accordance with the International Building Code . Exception: Storage in approved hazardous materials storage cabinets constructed in accordance with Section 5003.8.7.

Two times the separation required by Chapter 57 for Class IB flammable liquids.2.Gases. The location and maximum amount of pyrophoric gas per storage area shall be in accordance with Table 6404.2.1.
TABLE 6404.2.1 PYROPHORIC GASES—DISTANCE FROM STORAGE TO EXPOSURESa
MAXIMUM AMOUNT PER STORAGE AREA (cubic feet)
MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN STORAGE AREAS (feet)
MINIMUM DISTANCE TO LOT LINES OF PROPERTY THAT CAN BE BUILT ON (feet)
MINIMUM DISTANCE TO PUBLIC STREETS, PUBLIC ALLEYS OR PUBLIC WAYS (feet)
MINIMUM DISTANCE TO BUILDINGS ON THE SAME PROPERTY
Nonrated construction or openings within 25 feet
Two-hour construction and no openings within 25 feet
Four-hour construction and no openings within 25 feet
250 5 25 5 5 0 0
2,500 10 50 10 10 5 0
7,500 20 100 20 20 10 0
For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 cubic foot = 0.02832 m3. a.The minimum required distances shall be reduced to 5 feet where protective structures having a minimum fire resistance of 2 hours interrupt the line of sight between the container and the exposure. The protective structure shall be not less than 5 feet from the exposure. The configuration of the protective structure shall allow natural ventilation to prevent the accumulation of hazardous gas concentrations.
6404.2.2 Weather protection.
Where overhead construction is provided for sheltering outdoor storage areas of pyrophoric materials, the storage areas shall be provided with approved automatic fire-extinguishing system protection.
Section 6405 Use
6405.1 General.

5003.1.1(3) shall be in accordance with Sections 5001, 5003 , 5005 and this chapter.
6405.2 Weather protection.
Where overhead construction is provided for sheltering of outdoor use areas of pyrophoric materials, the use areas shall be provided with approved automatic fire-extinguishing system protection.
6405.3 Silane gas.
The use of silane gas, and gas mixtures with a silane concentration of 1.37 percent or more by volume, shall be in accordance with ANSI/CGA G-13.
