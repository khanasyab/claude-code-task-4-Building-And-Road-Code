Chapter 50 Hazardous Materials—General Provisions
User notes.
About this chapter: Chapter 50 contains the general requirements for all hazardous materials in all occupancies. Hazardous materials are defined as those that pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of operating or emergency personnel, the public and the environment if not properly controlled during handling, storage, manufacture, processing, packaging, use, disposal or transportation. The general provisions of this chapter are intended to be companion provisions with the specific requirements of Chapters 51 through 67 regarding a given hazardous material. Also, Sections 414 and 415 of the International Building Code®contain construction requirements related to the storage and use of such materials.
