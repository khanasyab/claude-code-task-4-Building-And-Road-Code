Appendix H Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS) Instructions The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction. User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix H is intended to assist businesses in establishing a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS) based on the classification and quantities of materials that would be found on-site in storage or use. The sample forms and available Safety Data Sheets (SDS) provide the basis for the evaluations. It is also a companion to Sections 407.5 and
407.6, which provide the requirement that the HMIS and HMMP be submitted where required by the fire code official. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
