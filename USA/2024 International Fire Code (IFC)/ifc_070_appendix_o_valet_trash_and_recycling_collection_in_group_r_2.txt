Appendix N Indoor Trade Shows and Exhibitions
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or legislation of the jurisdiction.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix N was created to address the hazards that are associated with larger, more complex trade shows and exhibitions. Although many of these requirements are already included in various locations in this code, some of the more important items, such as requirements for covered booths and multiple-level booths, are not. The intent is to have the requirements covering these events in a single location with pointers to other locations within this code, which makes it easier for those organizing exhibitions and individual exhibitors who are unfamiliar with the fire code to locate the requirements that are applicable to them. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
