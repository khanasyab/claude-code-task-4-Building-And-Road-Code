701.6.2.1 (7.6.2.1) Annual Average GHG Emissions.
To determine the annual CO2e for each energy source in the baseline building and proposed design (GHGUBB, GHGRBB, GHGproposed), the energy consumption for each fuel shall be multiplied by the CO2e emission factors from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1). U.S. locations shall use values for eGRID subregions from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1) and Figure 701.6.2.1 (Figure 7.6.2.1) for electricity. Locations outside the U.S. shall use the value for “All other electricity” or locally derived values.(Informative Note: The values in Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1) are based on eGRID subregions and delivery of fossil fuels for U.S. locations. Some jurisdictions use locally derived values based on procedures in Informative Appendix I.)GHGX=∑i(Qi×ei) where:GHG x =
annual
CO2e emissions for GHGUBB, GHGRBB, and GHGproposed from Section 701.6.2 (7.6.2), kg. Qi =
annual energy consumption, MWh.ei =

index for fuel used at the baseline or proposed building. The avoided emissions from off-site renewable energy procurement shall be calculated as follows:AE=∑K(Qk×REPFk×ee) where:Qk =
annual renewable energy (electricity) purchased through procurement method k, MWh.REPFk =
renewable energy procurement factor from Table 701.4.1.2 (Table 7.4.1.2) for renewable energy procurement method k, unitless.ee =
CO2e emissions rate for electricity taken from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1). eGRID values shall be used when applicable.k =

Informative Note: The CO2e emission factors presented in this table are based on U.S. data and a 20-year time horizon for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). When comparing or combining CO2e values, care should be taken to ensure that a consistent time horizon is used for all estimates of CO2e. Informative Appendix I, Table I1001 (Table I-10), has emission rates based on a 100-year time horizon for use when the use of 100- year time horizons is necessary.

701.6.2.2 (7.6.2.2) [JO] Long-Run Marginal Emission Rates (LRMER).
Section 701.6.2.2 (7.6.2.2) replaces Section 701.6.2.1 (7.6.2.1) for electricity emissions calculations. Electricity carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions for the baseline building design and proposed design shall be calculated using the long-run marginal emission rates from Normative Appendix D for each time period. The calculation shall be made using month-hour or annual-hour values and shall be approved. For fossil fuels and thermal energy, the CO2e emissions shall be calculated by multiplying by the CO2e emission factors from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1) times the annual consumption.GHGx=∑t[qe,t×ee,t]+∑i[Qi×ei] where:GHG x =
annual long-run marginal
CO2e emissions for GHGUBB, GHGRBB, and GHGP, units CO2e for a specified GWP time horizon.qe,t =
annual electricity consumption for time period t, MWh.e e,t
=
long-run marginal CO2e emissions rate for electricity in time period t from Normative Appendix D, Tables D101 through D2001 (Tables D-1 through D-20) units kg/MWh.t =
index for time period of electricity consumption.Qi =
annual energy consumption for fossil fuels or thermal energy, MWh.ei =
CO2e emissions rate taken from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1) for fossil fuel or thermal energy type i.i =
index for fossil fuel or thermal energy type. Informative Note: The
CO2e time-horizon is independent of the index for the time period of electricity consumption (t).The avoided emissions from off-site renewable energy procurement shall be calculated as shown in the following equation and meet the requirements of Section 701.4.1.3 (7.4.1.3).AE=∑g[Qg×REPF×AEg] where:Qg =
annual renewable electricity procured for renewable energy generator type g, MWh.g =
index for generator type.AEg =

701.6.3 (7.6.3) Zero Energy Performance Index.
The zero energy performance index (zEPI2004) of the proposed design, including on-site renewable energy systems, shall be less than the target (zEPI2004 Target). zEPI2004 and zEPI2004 Target shall be calculated as follows:zEPI2004=∑iPDSEi×ri-∑kREk×REPFk×re∑iBBSEi×ri where:zEPI2004 =
zero energy performance index relative to the Standard 90.1
baseline building design as defined in the performance rating method of Standard 90.1, Normative Appendix G.PDSEi =
proposed design site energy use for energy type i.BBSEi =
baseline building site energy use for energy type i; created following the rules in Standard 90.1, Normative Appendix G.ri =
source energy conversion factor for energy type i; taken from Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1).REk =
annual renewable energy electricity production for renewable energy procurement method k [see Table 701.4.1.2 (Table 7.4.1.2)].REPFk =
renewable energy factor from Table 701.4.1.2 (Table 7.4.1.2) for renewable energy procurement method k.re =
source energy conversion factor taken from Table 701.4.1.2 (Table 7.4.1.2) for electricity. U.S. Locations shall use values for eGRID subregions from Table 701.4.1.2 (Table 7.4.1.2) for electricity. Locations outside the U.S. shall use the value for “All other electricity” or locally derived values. zEPI2004 Target=[BBUSE+(BBRSE×BPFC)]×(1-RFC)BBUSE+BBRSE where:zEPI2004 Target =
zero energy performance index target required for achieving compliance with the standard, unitless.BBUSE =
baseline building unregulated energy use expressed in source units.BBRSE =
baseline building regulated energy use expressed in source units.BPFc =

=
renewable fraction for cost from Table 701.6.1 (Table 7.6.1), unitless.
Informative Notes:
1.On-site thermal energy and renewable energy contributions to district energy plants are accounted for in the PDSEi term through reductions in electricity and/or gas use. The REk term will always be electricity.2.Informative Appendix H details a methodology for converting zEPI2004 to zEPI. zEPI2004 uses Standard 90.1, Normative Appendix G, to define the baseline building. The traditional definition of zEPI uses the median energy of the existing building stock in the year 2000 as the baseline. The traditional zEPI definition is used by the Architecture 2030 program and other programs.3.The values in Table 701.6.2.1 (Table 7.6.2.1) are derived from United States data. The procedures in Informative Appendix I may be used to develop source energy conversion factors when conditions are different.
701.6.4 (7.6.4) [JO] Energy Simulation Aided Design.
For building projects that exceed 25,000 ft2 (2300 m2) of gross floor area, the building project shall comply with the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 209, Section 4.2.1.
