801.10.3 (8.10.3) [JO] Shading for Offices.
For office spaces 250 ft2(23 m2) and larger, each façade shall be designed with a shading projection factor (PF). The PF shall not be less than 0.5 for the first story above grade and 0.25 for other above-grade stories. Shading is allowed to be external or internal using the interior PF. Shading devices shall be limited to the following:a. Louvers, sun shades, light shelves, and any other permanent device. Any vertical fenestration that employs a combination of interior and external shading is allowed to be separated into multiple segments for compliance purposes. Each segment shall comply with the requirements for either external or interior PF.b. Building self-shading through roof overhangs or recessed windows.
Exceptions: 1. Facades facing within 45 degrees of true north in the northern hemisphere or facades facing 45 degrees from true south in the southern hemisphere.2. Translucent panels and glazing systems with a measured haze value greater than 90% when tested according to ASTM D1003 or other approved test method, and that are entirely 8 ft (2.5 m) above the floor do not require external shading devices.3. Where equivalent shading of the vertical fenestration is provided by buildings, structures, geological formations, or permanent exterior projections that are not horizontal, as determined by sun-angle studies at the peak solar altitude on the summer solstice and three hours before and after the peak solar altitude on the summer solstice.4. Vertical fenestration with automatically controlled shading devices in compliance with Section 701.4.2.6 (7.4.2.6), Exception 2.5. Vertical fenestration with automatically controlled dynamic glazing in compliance with Section 701.4.2.6 (7.4.2.6), Exception 3.6. Existing buildings undergoing alteration, repair, relocation, or a change in occupancy.
801.10.4 (8.10.4) Daylight Simulation.
For the spaces listed in Table 801.10.2A (Table 8.10.2A), and any spaces required to have daylighting in accordance with Section 801.10.1 (8.10.1), the total floor area shall be calculated, and computer modeling shall be used to determine that the requirements specified in Sections 801.10.4.1 (8.10.4.1) through 801.11.2 (8.11.2) are met. Computer models shall use an hourly simulation and shall adhere to the modeling protocols described in IES LM 83 for spatial daylight autonomy (sDA) calculations in Section 801.10.4.1 (8.10.4.1) and annual sunlight exposure (ASE) calculations in Sections 801.10.4.2 (8.10.4.2) and 801.11.2 (8.11.2).
801.10.4.1 (8.10.4.1) Minimum Daylight.
The computed area-weighted sDA shall not be less than 40%. The sDA within each space shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology of IES LM 83. Calculations shall be made on the basis of 28 fc (300 lux) for all spaces, with the exception of the following space types, which shall be calculated on the basis of 14 fc (150 lux): post-office sorting areas, gymnasia, big-box retail, transportation facility terminal ticket counters, airport concourses, and nonrefrigerated warehouses. Exceptions: 1. A space used for tasks or activities requiring routine dark conditions for more than 4 daytime hours per day.2. A space where the height of existing facing structures above the vertical fenestration is not less than twice the distance between the vertical fenestration and facing structures, measured from the top of the glazing.
801.10.4.2 (8.10.4.2) Excessive Sunlight.
The ASE, calculated with a threshold of 93 fc (1000 lux) and 250 hours, shall not exceed 20% of the floor area.Exceptions: 1. Spaces less than 250 ft2(23 m2).2. Vertical fenestration with automatically controlled shading devices in compliance with Section 701.4.2.6 (7.4.2.6), Exception 2.3. Vertical fenestration with automatically controlled dynamic glazing in compliance with Section 701.4.2.6 (7.4.2.6), Exception 3.
801.11 (8.11) Solar Glare Control.
The building project shall comply with either Section 801.11.1 (8.11.1) or 801.11.2 (8.11.2).
801.11.1 (8.11.1) Operable Glare Control.
View fenestration within 7 ft (21 m) of the finished floor in the spaces listed in Table 801.10.2A (Table 8.10.2A) shall comply with this section.View fenestration shall have one or more operable glare control devices capable of reducing the specular visible transmittance of the fenestration assembly to 3% or less. Such glare control devices shall allow an occupant or control system to change the device’s position or light transmission level in order to address glare in the space. Operable glare control devices include movable interior window blinds, curtains, and shades; movable exterior louvers, screens, awnings, shades, and blinds; and dynamic glazing. Where fabric shades are used, the openness factor, also known as direct-direct transmittance, shall be tested according to Standard EN14500.Occupants shall have the capability to temporarily override automatic methods of glare control for periods not exceeding two hours.Exceptions: 1. Spaces compliant with Section 801.11.2 (8.11.2).2. For buildings located greater than 20 degrees latitude north or south of the equator, view fenestration oriented within 10 degrees of true north in northern hemisphere locations or within 10 degrees of true south in southern hemisphere location.3. Where permanent interior or exterior obstructions, such as buildings, structures, overhangs, and fins, have a specular visible transmittance of not greater than 3% and block a direct beam of sunlight from passing through the view fenestration at a point in the middle of the view fenestration both horizontally and vertically, at the peak solar altitude and four hours before and after the peak solar altitude on the summer solstice and the spring equinox as determined by sun-angle studies.
801.11.2 (8.11.2) Low Annual Sunlight Exposure.
The ASE, as calculated for vertical fenestration with a threshold of 93 fc (1000 lux) and 250 hours, shall not exceed 3% of the floor area for the spaces listed in Table 801.10.2A (Table 8.10.2A).Exception: View fenestration with operable glare control in compliance with Section 801.11.1 (8.11.1).
801.12 (8.12) Exterior Views.
Not less than 50% of the total combined floor area of each of the space types listed in Table 801.12 (Table 8.12) shall have a direct line-of-sight, originating at a height of not more than 42 in. (1.1 m) above the floor, to view fenestration meeting the criteria of this section. The line-of-sight distance to view fenestration shall not exceed 40 ft (12.2 m). The glazing area shall not be less than 8% of the floor area required to have exterior views. Qualifying view fenestration shall meet the following criteria:a. Glazing shall have a haze value less than 3%, as determined in accordance with ASTM D1003.b. Center-of-glass visible transmittance (VT) shall be not less than 20%.c. The product of the center-of-glass VT and the openness factor of screens, patterned films, and ceramic frits shall be not less than 20%.d. Where dynamic glazing is provided, glazing shall have a center-of-glass VT of not less than 20% at the highest setting of its VT range.e. Where stationary opaque window treatments are provided, such as nonoperable blinds, shades, and louvers, such treatments shall not obstruct more than 40% of the fenestration glazing area.
