Chapter 5 Special Building Construction Regulations
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 5 provides regulations that establish minimum standards for the location, design and construction of buildings and structures based on fire hazard severity in the wildland-urban interface. The construction provisions of Chapter 5 are intended to supplement the requirements of the International Building Code and address mitigation of the unique hazards posed to buildings by wildfire and to reduce the hazards of building fires spreading to wildland fuels. This is accomplished by requiring ignition-resistant construction materials based on the hazard severity of the building site. Construction features regulated include underfloor areas; roof coverings; eaves and soffits; gutters and downspouts; exterior walls, doors and windows; ventilation openings and accessory structures.
Section 501 General
CDP

501.2 Objective.
CDP
The objective of this chapter is to establish minimum standards to locate, design and construct buildings and structures or portions thereof for the protection of life and property, to resist damage from wildfires, and to mitigate building and structure fires from spreading to wildland fuels. The minimum standards set forth in this chapter vary with the critical fire weather, slope and fuel type to provide increased protection, above the requirements set forth in the International Building Code, from the various levels of hazards.
501.3 Fire-resistance-rated construction.
