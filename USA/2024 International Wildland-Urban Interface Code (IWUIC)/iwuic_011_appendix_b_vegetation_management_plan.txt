Appendix A General Requirements
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix A, while not part of the code, can become part of the code when specifically included in the adopting ordinance. Its purpose is to provide fire protection measures supplemental to those found in Chapter 6 to reduce the threat of wildfire in a wildland-urban interface area and improve the capability for controlling such fires. This appendix includes detailed requirements for vegetation control; the code official’s authority to close wildland-interface areas in times of high fire danger; control of fires, fireworks usage and other sources of ignition; storage of hazardous materials and combustibles; bans on the dumping of waste materials and ashes and coals in wildland-urban interface areas; protection of pumps and water supplies; and limits on temporary uses within the wildland-urban interface area.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
