Appendix C Fire Hazard Severity Form
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix C, while not part of the code, can become part of the code (replacing Table 502.1) when specifically included in the adopting ordinance. Its purpose is to provide an alternative methodology to using Table 502.1 for analyzing the fire hazard severity of building sites using a pre-assigned value/scoring system for each feature that impacts the hazard level of a building site. Included in the evaluation are site access, types and management of vegetation, percentage of defensible space on the site, site topography, class of roofing and other construction materials used on the building (existing or to be constructed on the site), fire protection water supply, and whether utilities are installed above or below ground.
Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IFC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
