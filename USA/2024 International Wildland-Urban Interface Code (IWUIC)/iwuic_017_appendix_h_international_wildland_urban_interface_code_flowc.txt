Appendix G Self-Defense Mechanism
This appendix is for information purposes and is not intended for adoption.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix G is an information appendix that provides discussion of some elements of the proposed self-defense mechanisms and their role in enhancing the protection of exposed structures in the wildland-urban interface. To accept alternative self-defense mechanisms, the code official must carefully examine whether these devices will be in place at the time of an event and whether they will assist or actually complicate the defense of the structure by fire suppression forces if they are available.
Section G101 General
CDP
G101.1 Identification of the problem.
CDP
The International Wildland-Urban Interface Code establishes a set of minimum standards to reduce the loss of property from wildfire. The purpose of these standards is to prevent wildfire spreading from vegetation to a building. Frequently, proposals are made by property or landowners of buildings located in the wildland-urban interface to consider other options and alternatives instead of meeting these minimum standards. This appendix chapter provides discussion of some elements of the proposed self-defense mechanisms and their role in enhancing the protection of exposed structures.
G101.2 Structural survivability.
CDP
Various stages of assault occur as a building is exposed to a wildland-urban fire. Ashes are cast in front of a fire out of a smoke or convection column, which can result in secondary ignitions. Heavier embers that have more body weight and may contain more heat to serve as sources of ignition follow. Finally, the actual intrusion of a flame front and the radiant heat flux can expose combustibles outside of a building and the exterior structure of a building to various levels of radiant heat. A study revealed that the actual exposure of a building to the flame front by the perimeter of the fire was usually less than 6 minutes. However, the exposure to the forms of other materials that can result in proliferation of other ignitions can vary, depending on wind, topography and fuel conditions.To enhance structural survivability, the self-defense mechanisms must, first, do everything possible to prevent the ignition of materials from objects that are cast in front of the fire and, second, they must withstand the assault of the fire on the structure to prevent flames from penetrating into the building and resulting in an interior fire. There are considerable problems in achieving both of these objectives using some of the proposed alternative forms of protection such as the lack of definitive standards for self-defense mechanisms on the exterior of buildings. Although fire service has done considerable research into the evaluation of technology, such as smoke detectors, fire alarms, and interior sprinkler systems, very limited amount of study has been done on exterior sprinkler systems.All forms of fire protection are classified as either active or passive. Active fire protection is taking specific action to control the fire in some manner. Passive fire protection uses resistance to ignition or provides some form of warning that allows other action to be taken. These two classifications of self-defense mechanisms create different problems with regard to being accepted as alternatives for building construction. Furthermore, certain self-defense mechanisms must be built in during new construction, and others may only be capable of being added as a retrofit to existing structures. As a matter of public policy, most code officials are reluctant to accept passive fire protection as an equivalent to a construction requirement, but are also reluctant to accept active fire protection systems that require intervention by suppression personnel.The unequal distribution of self-defense mechanisms within a specific neighborhood poses another problem. If an individual is granted a waiver or exemption on the basis of putting in a nonmandated self-defense mechanism, and the neighbors to either side choose not to do so, or are not given the same options, there is a potential operational problem.
G101.3 Alternative concepts.
CDP
Sections G101.3.1 through G101.3.6 provide consideration of several alternative self-defense mechanisms.
G101.3.1 Exterior sprinkler systems.
CDP
Currently, there is no nationally accepted standard for the design and installation of exterior fire sprinkler systems. Interior sprinkler systems are regulated by nationally recognized standards that have specific requirements. However, exterior sprinkler systems lack such uniformity. What is generally proposed is a type of sprinkler system, placed on the roofs or eaves of a building, whose primary purpose is to wet down the roof. These types of systems can be activated either manually or automatically. However, the contemporary thought on exterior sprinkler systems is that if the roof classification is of sufficient fire resistance, exterior sprinklers are of little or no value. Another option and alternative with exterior sprinklers is to use them to improve the relative humidity and fuel moisture in the defensible space. In this case, the exterior sprinkler is not used to protect the structure as much as it attempts to alter the fuel situation. However, studies do not support the idea that merely spraying water into the air in the immediate vicinity of a rapidly advancing wildland-urban fire does much good. Clearly, irrigation systems that keep plants healthy and fire-resistive plants that resist convection and radiated heat can accomplish the same purpose.
G101.3.2 Alternative water supply systems for exposure protection.
CDP
Pools and spas are often offered as an alternative water source for fire departments. These water sources must be reliable and able to be accessed to be of any use by fire protection forces. Accessibility means that the fire department must be able to withdraw the water without having to go through extraordinary measures such as knocking down fences or having to set up drafting situations. Designs have been created to put liquid- or gas-fueled pumps or gravity valves on pools and spas to allow fire departments to access these water systems. A key vulnerability to the use of these alternative water systems is loss of electrical power. When the reliability of a water system depends on external power sources, it cannot be relied upon by firefighters to be available in a worst-case scenario.
G101.3.3 Class A foam systems.
CDP
One technology is Class A foam devices. These are devices that allow a homeowner to literally coat the exterior of their house with a thick layer of foam that prevents the penetration of embers and radiant heat to the structure. Experiments in various wildland fire agencies advocate foaming houses in advance of fire and flame fronts. To be accepted by the code official, the Class A foam system should pass rigorous scrutiny with regard to the manner and needs in which it is activated, the ways and means in which it is properly maintained, and a ways and means to test the system for its operational readiness during hiatus between emergencies.
G101.3.4 Enhanced exterior fire protection.
CDP
This alternative method would increase the degree of fire resistance on the exterior of a building. This is most often an alternative recommended as a retroactive application when individual properties cannot achieve adequate defensible space on the exterior of a building. Normally, fire resistance and building scenarios are concerned with containing a fire. Fire-resistance ratings within building design ensures resistance to a fire for the specified time to compartmentalize the building’s interior.To improve fire resistance on the exterior of the structure, the primary emphasis is on preventing intrusion into the building. This means protection of apertures and openings that may or may not be required to have any degree of fire resistance by accepted building codes. The option that is available here is for individuals to provide coverage in the form of shutters or closures to these areas, which, along with maintenance of combustible-free perimeters, can often prevent intrusion.There are obvious limitations to this alternative. First and foremost is the means of adequately evaluating the proposed fire resistance of any given assembly. Testing techniques to determine fire resistance for such objects as drywall and other forms of construction may not be applicable to exterior application. Nonetheless, code officials should determine the utility of a specific fire resistance proposal by extrapolating conservatively.
G101.3.5 Shelter in place.
CDP
Developments in the wildland-urban interface may be designed to allow occupants to “Shelter in place.” Use of this design alternative should include ignition-resistant construction, access, water supply, automatic sprinkler systems, provisions for and maintenance of defensible space, and a Fire Protection Plan.A fire protection plan describes ways to minimize the fire problems created by a specific project or development. The purpose for the fire protection plan is to reduce the burden and impact of the project or development on the community’s fire protection delivery system. The plan may utilize components of land use, building construction, vegetation management and other design techniques and technologies. It should include specific mitigation measures consistent with the unique problems resulting from the location, topography, geology, flammable vegetation and climate of the proposed site. The plan shall be consistent with this code, and approved by the fire code official. The cost of preparation and review is to be borne by the project or development proponent.
G101.3.6 Building location.
CDP
The location of a new building within lot lines should be considered as it relates to topography and fire behavior. Buildings located in natural chimneys, such as narrow canyons and saddles, are especially fire prone because winds are funneled into these areas and eddies are created. Buildings located on narrow ridges without setbacks may be subjected to increased flame and convective heat exposure from a fire advancing from below. Stone or masonry walls can act as heat shields and deflect the flames. Swimming pools and rated or noncombustible decks and patios can be used to create a setback, decreasing the exposure to the structure. Attic and under-floor vents, picture windows and sliding glass doors should not face possible corridors due to the increased risk of flame or ember penetration.
G101.4 Conclusion.
The purpose of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code is to establish minimum standards that prevent the loss of structures, even if fire department intervention is absent. To accept alternative self-defense mechanisms, the code official must carefully examine whether these devices will be in place at the time of an event and whether they will assist or actually complicate the defense of the structure by fire suppression forces if they are available. The best alternative to having a building comply with all of the provisions of this code is to remove sources of fuel. This is closely paralleled by excellent housekeeping between the vegetation and the structure. Alternative ways of achieving each of these goals can and should be considered after scrutiny by appropriately credentialed and qualified fire protection personnel.
