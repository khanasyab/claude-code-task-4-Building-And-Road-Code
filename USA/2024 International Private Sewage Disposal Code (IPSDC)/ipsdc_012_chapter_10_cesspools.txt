Chapter 9 Mound Systems
User notes:
About this chapter:
Mound systems are another method for disposal of the nonpotable water from a septic tank. The existing soil at the site may not have the capacity to absorb the water because of seasonal ground water conditions or presence of bedrock just below the soil surface. Chapter 9 provides extensive design information and installation methods to build mound systems for absorbing the nonpotable water.
Section 901 General
CDP
901.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the design and installation of mound systems.
Section 902 Soil and site requirements
902.1 Soil borings.
Not less than three soil borings per site shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 4 to determine the depth to seasonal or permanent soil saturation or bedrock. Identification of a replacement system area is not required.
902.2 Prohibited locations.
A mound system shall be prohibited on sites not having the minimum depths of soil specified in Table 902.2. The installation of a mound in a filled area shall be prohibited. A mound shall not be installed in a compacted area or over a failing conventional system.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm.
902.3 Slowly permeable soils with or without high ground water.
Percolation tests shall be conducted at a depth of 20 inches to 24 inches (508 mm to 610 mm) from existing grade. Where a more slowly permeable horizon exists at less than 20 inches to 24 inches (508 mm to 610 mm), percolation tests shall be conducted within that horizon. A mound system shall be suitable for such site condition where the percolation rate is greater than 60 minutes per inch and less than or equal to 120 minutes per inch (2.4 min/mm to 4.7 min/mm).
902.4 Shallow permeable soils over creviced bedrock.
Percolation tests shall be conducted at a depth of 12 inches to 18 inches (305 mm to 457 mm) from existing grade. Where a more slowly permeable horizon exists within 12 inches to 18 inches (305 mm to 457 mm), percolation tests shall be conducted within that horizon. A mound system shall be suitable for such site condition where the percolation rate is between 3 minutes per inch and 60 minutes per inch (0.12 min/mm and 2.4 min/mm).
902.5 Permeable soils with high ground water.
Percolation tests shall be conducted at a depth of 20 inches to 24 inches (508 mm to 610 mm) from existing grade. Where a more slowly permeable horizon exists at less than 20 inches to 24 inches (508 mm to 610 mm), percolation tests shall be conducted within that horizon. A mound system shall be suitable for such site condition where the percolation rate is between 0 minutes per inch and 60 minutes per inch (0 min/mm and 2.4 min/mm).
902.6 Depth to pervious rock.
Not less than 24 inches (610 mm) of unsaturated natural soil shall be over creviced or porous bedrock.
902.7 Depth to high ground water.
Not less than 24 inches (610 mm) of unsaturated natural soil shall be present over high ground water as indicated by soil mottling or direct observation of water in accordance with Chapter 4.
902.8 Slopes.
A mound shall not be installed on a slope greater than 6 percent where the percolation rate is between 30 and 120 minutes per inch (1.2 and 4.7 min/mm). The maximum allowable slope shall be 12 percent where there is a complex slope (two directions).
902.9 Location of mound on sloping sites.
The mound shall be located so the longest dimension of the mound and the distribution lines are perpendicular to the slope. The mound shall be placed upslope and not at the base of a slope. The mound shall be situated so the effluent is not concentrated in one direction where there is a complex slope (two directions). Surface water runoff shall be diverted around the mound.
902.10 Depth to rock strata or 50 percent by volume rock fragments.
Not less than 60 inches (1524 mm) of soil shall be present over uncreviced, impermeable bedrock. Where the soil contains 50 percent coarse fragments by volume in the upper 24 inches (610 mm), a mound shall not be installed except where there is not less than 24 inches (610 mm) of permeable, unsaturated soil with less than 50 percent coarse fragments located beneath this layer.
Section 903 System design
903.1 Mound dimensions and design.
For one- and two-family dwellings and other buildings with estimated wastewater flows less than 600 gallons (2271 L) per day, the mound dimensions shall be determined in accordance with this section or Tables 903.1(1) through 903.1(12). Dimensions and corresponding letter designations listed in the tables and referenced in this section are shown in Appendix A, Figures A101.1(6) through A101.1(10). For buildings with estimated waste-water flows exceeding 600 gallons (2271 L) per day, the mound shall be designed in accordance with this section. Daily wastewater flow shall be estimated as 150 gallons (568 L) per day per bedroom for one- and two-family dwellings. For other buildings the total daily wastewater flow shall be determined in accordance with Table 802.7.2.

The downslope width (I) on a sloping site shall be increased or the upslope width (J) and downslope (I) widths on a level site shall be increased until sufficient area is available if the basal area available is not equal to or greater than the basal area required.
903.7 Dose volume and pump.
The dose volume and pump shall conform to the requirements of Chapters 7 and 8.
Section 904 Construction techniques
904.1 General.
Construction shall not commence where the soil is so wet a soil wire forms when the soil is rolled between the hands. Installation of mound systems where the soil on the site is frozen shall be prohibited for new construction.
904.2 Site preparation.
Excess vegetation shall be cut and removed from the mound area. Small trees shall be cut to grade surface, leaving the stumps in place.
904.3 Force main.
The force main from the pumping chamber shall be installed before the mound site is plowed. The force main shall be sloped uniformly toward the pumping chamber so the force main drains after each dose.
904.4 Plowing.
The site shall be plowed with a moldboard plow or chisel plow. The site shall be plowed to a depth of 7 inches to 8 inches (178 mm to 203 mm) with the plowing perpendicular to the slope. Rototillers shall not be used. The sand fill shall be placed immediately after plowing. Foot and vehicular traffic shall be kept off the plowed area.
904.5 Sand fill material.
The fill material shall be medium sand texture defined as 25 percent or more very coarse, coarse and medium sand and not more than 50 percent fine sand, very fine sand, silt and clay. The percentage of silt plus one and one-half times the percentage of clay shall not exceed 15 percent. Fill materials with higher content of silt and clay shall not be used.
904.5.1 Placement of sand fill.
The medium sand fill shall be moved into place from the upslope and side edges of the plowed area. Vehicular traffic shall be prohibited in the area extending to 25 feet (7620 mm) beyond the downslope edge of the mound. The sand fill shall be moved into place with a track-type tractor and not less than 6 inches (152 mm) of sand shall be kept beneath the tracks at all times.
904.6 Installation of the absorption area.
The bed or trenches shall be formed within the sand fill. The bottom of the trenches or bed shall be level. The elevation of the bottom of the trenches or bed shall be checked at the upslope and downslope edges to ensure that the fill has been placed to the proper depth.
904.7 Placement of the aggregate.
Not less than 6 inches (152 mm) of coarse aggregate ranging in size from 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inches (12.7 mm to 64 mm) shall be placed in the bed or trench excavation. The top of the aggregate shall be level.
904.8 Distribution system.
Distribution systems shall be placed on the aggregate, with the holes located on the bottom of the distribution pipe. The ends of all distribution pipes shall be marked at the surface, and an observation pipe shall be placed to the bottom of the bed or each trench.
904.9 Cover.
The top of the bed or trenches shall be covered with not less than 2 inches (51 mm) of aggregate ranging in size from 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inches (12.7 mm to 64 mm) and not less than 4 inches to 5 inches (102 mm to 127 mm) of uncompacted straw or marsh hay or approved synthetic fabric shall be placed over the aggregate. Cap and topsoil covers shall be in place and the mound shall be seeded immediately and protected from erosion.
904.10 Maintenance.
When the septic tank is pumped, the pump chamber shall be inspected and pumped to remove any solids present. Excess traffic in the mound area shall be avoided.
