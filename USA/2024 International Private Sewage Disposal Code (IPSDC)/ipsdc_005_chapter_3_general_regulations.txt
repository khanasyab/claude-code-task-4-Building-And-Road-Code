Chapter 2 Definitions
User notes:
About this chapter: Codes, by their very nature, are technical documents. Every word, term and punctuation mark can add to or change the meaning of a technical requirement. It is necessary to maintain a consensus on the specific meaning of each term contained in the code. Chapter 2 performs this function by stating clearly what specific terms mean for the purpose of the code.
Section 201 General
201.1 Scope.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this code, have the meanings indicated in this chapter.
201.2 Interchangeability.
Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the masculine gender include the feminine and neuter; the singular number includes the plural and the plural, the singular.
201.3 Terms defined in other codes.
Where terms are not defined in this code and are defined in the International Building Code or the International Plumbing Code, such terms shall have meanings ascribed to them as in those codes.
201.4 Terms not defined.
Where terms are not defined through the methods authorized by this section, such terms shall have ordinarily accepted meanings such as the context implies.

AGGREGATE.Graded hard rock that has been washed with water under pressure over a screen during or after grading to remove fine material and with a hardness value of 3 or greater on Mohs’ Scale of Hardness. Aggregate that will scratch a copper penny without leaving any residual rock material on the coin has a hardness value of 3 or greater on Mohs’ Scale of Hardness.[P]AIR BREAK (Drainage System).A piping arrangement in which a drain from a fixture, appliance or device discharges indirectly into another fixture, receptacle or interceptor at a point below the flood level rim and above the trap seal.ALLUVIUM.Soil deposited by floodwaters. APPROVED AGENCY. An established and recognized organization that is regularly engaged in conducting tests, furnishing inspection services or furnishing product evaluation or certification where such organization has been approved by the code official. BEDROCK.The rock that underlies soil material or is located at the earth’s surface. Bedrock is encountered when the weathered in-place consolidated material, larger than 0.08 inch (2 mm) in size, is more than 50 percent by volume.CESSPOOL.A covered excavation in the ground receiving sewage or other organic wastes from a drainage system that is designed to retain the organic matter and solids, permitting the liquids to seep into the soil cavities.CLEAR-WATER WASTES.Cooling water and condensate drainage from refrigeration compressors and air-conditioning equipment, water used for equipment chilling purposes, liquid having no impurities or where impurities have been reduced below a minimum concentration considered harmful, and cooled condensate from steam-heating systems or other equipment.[A]CODE OFFICIAL.The officer or other designated authority charged with administration and enforcement of this code or a duly authorized representative.COLLUVIUM.Soil transported under the influence of gravity.COLOR.The moist color of the soil based on Munsell soil color charts.[A]CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS.All the written, graphic and pictorial documents prepared or assembled for describing the design, location and physical characteristics of the elements of the project necessary for obtaining a building permit. The construction drawings shall be drawn to an appropriate scale.CONVENTIONAL SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM.A system employing gravity flow from the septic or other treatment tank and applying effluent to the soil through the use of a seepage trench, bed or pit.[BS]DESIGN FLOOD ELEVATION.The elevation of the “design flood,” including wave height, relative to the datum specified on the community’s legally designated flood hazard map. In areas designated as Zone AO, the design flood elevation shall be the elevation of the highest existing grade of the building’s perimeter plus the depth number (in feet) specified on the flood hazard map. In areas designated as Zone AO where a depth number is not specified on the map, the depth number shall be taken as being equal to 2 feet (610 mm).DETAILED SOIL MAP.A map prepared by or for a state or federal agency participating in the National Cooperative Soil Survey showing soil series, type and phases at a scale of not more than 2,000 feet to the inch (24 m/mm) and which includes related explanatory information.DOSING SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM.A system employing a pump or automatic siphon to elevate or distribute effluent to the soil through the use of a seepage trench or bed.EFFLUENT.Liquid discharged from a septic or other treatment tank.[BS]FLOOD HAZARD AREA.The greater of the following two areas:1.The area within a flood plain subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.2.The area designated as a flood hazard area on a community’s flood hazard map or as otherwise legally designated.HIGH GROUND WATER.Soil saturation zones, including perched water tables, shallow regional ground water tables or aquifers, or zones seasonally, periodically or permanently saturated.HOLDING TANK.An approved water-tight receptacle for collecting and holding sewage.HORIZONTAL REFERENCE POINT.A stationary, easily identifiable point to which horizontal dimensions are related.LEGAL DESCRIPTION.An accurate metes and bounds description, a lot and block number in a recorded subdivision, a recorded assessor’s plat or a public land survey description to the nearest 40 acres (16 ha).MANHOLE.An opening of sufficient size to permit a person to gain access to a sewer or any portion of a private sewage disposal system.MOBILE UNIT.A structure of vehicular, portable design, built on a chassis and designed to be moved from one site to another and to be used with or without a permanent foundation.MOBILE UNIT PARK.Any plot or plots of ground owned by a person, state or local government upon which two or more units, occupied for dwelling or sleeping purposes regardless of mobile unit ownership, are located and whether or not a charge is made for such accommodation.[P]NUISANCE.Public nuisance as known in common law or equity jurisprudence; whatever is dangerous to human life or detrimental to health; whatever building, structure or premises is not sufficiently ventilated, sewered, drained, cleaned or lighted, in reference to its intended use; and whatever renders the air, human food, drink or water supply unwholesome.PAN.A soil horizon cemented with any one of a number of cementing agents such as iron, organic matter, silica, calcium, carbonate, gypsum or a combination of chemicals. Pans will resist penetration from a knife blade and are slowly permeable horizons or are impermeable. PEER REVIEW. An independent and objective technical review conducted by an approved third party. PERCOLATION TEST.The method of testing absorption qualities of the soil (see Section 404).PERMEABILITY.The ease with which liquids move through the soil. One of the soil qualities listed in soil survey reports.PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.A soil absorption system using a pump or automatic siphon and smaller diameter distribution piping with small-diameter perforations to introduce effluent into the soil.PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM.A sewage treatment and disposal system serving a single structure with a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same parcel as the structure. This term also means an alternative sewage disposal system, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving more than one structure or a system located on a different parcel than the structure.

A watercourse flows in a definite channel, with a bed, sides or banks, and usually discharges itself into some other stream or body of water. It must be something more than mere surface drainage over the entire face of a tract of land, occasioned by unusual freshets or other extraordinary cause.

Such hollows or ravines are not, in legal contemplation, watercourses.WORKMANSHIP.Work of such character that will fully secure the results sought in all the sections of this code as intended for the health, safety and welfare protection of all individuals.
