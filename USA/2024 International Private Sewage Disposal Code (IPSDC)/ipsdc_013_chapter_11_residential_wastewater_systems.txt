Chapter 10 Cesspools
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 10 addresses the construction of cesspools. Although cesspools were a common method for disposing of sewage for new buildings in some areas of the United States, the code only allows the construction of a cesspool as a temporary measure until a proper sewage disposal system can be installed.
Section 1001 General
CDP
1001.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the design and installation of cesspools.
1001.2 Application.
Cesspools shall not be installed, except where approved by the code official. A cesspool shall be considered as only a temporary expedient pending the construction of a public sewer; as an overflow facility where installed in conjunction with an existing cesspool; or as a means of sewage disposal for limited, minor or temporary applications.
1001.3 Construction.
Cesspools shall conform to the construction requirements of Section 605.3 for seepage pits. The seepage pit shall have a minimum sidewall of 20 feet (6096 mm) below the inlet opening. Where a stratum of gravel or equally pervious material of 4 feet (1219 mm) or more in thickness is found, the sidewall need not be more than 10 feet (3048 mm) below the inlet.
