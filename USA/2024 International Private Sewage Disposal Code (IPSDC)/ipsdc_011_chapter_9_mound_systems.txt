User notes:
About this chapter:
Septic tanks and other treatment tanks are key components of private sewage disposal systems as they must be properly sized to achieve the desired reduction of sewage to its basic components of sludge and nonpotable water. Chapter 8 covers sizing, capacity and installation of these tanks and water holding tanks.
Section 801 General
CDP
801.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the design, installation, repair and maintenance of septic tanks, treatment tanks and holding tanks.
Section 802 Septic tanks and other treatment tanks
802.1 General.
Septic tanks shall be fabricated or constructed of welded steel, monolithic concrete, fiberglass or an approved material. Tanks shall be watertight and fabricated to constitute an individual structure, and shall be designed and constructed to withstand anticipated loads. The design of prefabricated septic tanks shall be approved. Plans for site-constructed concrete tanks shall be approved prior to construction.
802.2 Design of Septic Tanks
Septic tanks shall have not less than two compartments. The inlet compartment shall be not less than two-thirds of the total capacity of the tank, not less than a 500-gallon (1893 L) liquid capacity and not less than 3 feet (914 mm) wide and 5 feet (1524 mm) long. The secondary compartment of a septic tank shall have not less than a capacity of 250 gallons (946 L) and not more than one-third of the total capacity. The secondary compartment of septic tanks having a capacity more than 1,500 gallons (5678 L) shall be not less than 5 feet (1524 mm) long.The liquid depth shall be not less than 30 inches (762 mm) and a maximum average of 6 feet (1829 mm). The total depth shall be not less than 8 inches (203 mm) greater than the liquid depth.Rectangular tanks shall be constructed with the longest dimensions parallel to the direction of the flow.Cylindrical tanks shall be not less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in diameter.
802.3 Inlets and outlets.
The inlet and outlet on all tanks or tank compartments shall be provided with open-end coated sanitary tees or baffles made of approved materials constructed to distribute flow and retain scum in the tank or compartments. The inlet and outlet openings on all tanks shall contain a stop or other provision that will prevent the insertion of the sewer piping beyond the inside wall of the tank. The tees or baffles shall extend not less than 6 inches (152 mm) above the liquid level, not less than 9 inches (229 mm) below the liquid level, and not greater than one-third the liquid depth below the liquid level. Not less than 2 inches (51 mm) of clear space shall be provided above the top of the baffles or tees. The bottom of the outlet opening shall be not less than 2 inches (51 mm) below the bottom of the inlet.
802.4 Manholes.
Each compartment of a tank shall be provided with not fewer than one manhole opening located over the inlet or outlet opening, and such opening shall be not less than 24 inches (610 mm) square or 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter. Where the inlet compartment of a septic tank exceeds 12 feet (3658 mm) in length, an additional manhole shall be provided over the baffle wall. Manholes shall terminate not greater than 6 inches (152 mm) below the ground surface. Steel tanks shall have not less than a 2-inch (51 mm) collar for the manhole extensions permanently welded to the tank. The manhole extension on fiberglass tanks shall be of the same material as the tank and an integral part of the tank. The collar shall be not less than 2 inches (51 mm) high.
802.5 Manhole covers.
Manhole risers shall be provided with a fitted, water-tight cover of concrete, steel, cast iron or other approved material capable of withstanding all anticipated loads. Manhole covers terminating above grade shall have an approved locking device.
802.6 Inspection opening.
An inspection opening shall be provided over either the inlet or outlet baffle of every treatment tank. The opening shall be not less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter with a tight-fitting cover. Inspection pipes terminating above ground shall be not less than 6 inches (152 mm) above finished grade. Inspection pipes approved for terminating below grade shall be not more than 2 inches (51 mm) below finished grade, and the location shall be permanently recorded.
802.7 Capacity and sizing.
The capacity of a septic tank or other treatment tank shall be based on the number of persons using the building to be served or on the volume and type of waste, whichever is greater. The minimum liquid capacity shall be 750 gallons (2839 L). Where the required capacity is to be provided by more than one tank, the minimum capacity of any tank shall be 750 gallons (2839 L). The installation of more than four tanks in series is prohibited.
802.7.1 Sizing of tank.
The minimum liquid capacity for one- and two-family dwellings shall be in accordance with Table 802.7.1.
