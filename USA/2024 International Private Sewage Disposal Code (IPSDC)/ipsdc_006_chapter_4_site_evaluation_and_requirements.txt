Chapter 3 General Regulations
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 3 covers general regulations for private sewage disposal installations. As many of these requirements would need to be repeated in Chapters 3 through 13, placing such requirements in only one location eliminates code development coordination issues associated with the same requirement in multiple locations. These general requirements can be superseded by more specific requirements for certain applications in Chapters 3 through 13.
Section 301 General
CDP
301.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the general regulations of private sewage disposal systems, including specific limitations and flood hazard areas.
Section 302 Specific limitations
302.1 Domestic waste.
Waste and sewage derived from ordinary living uses shall enter the septic or treatment tank unless otherwise specifically exempted by the code official or this code.
302.2 Cesspools and privies.
Privies shall be prohibited. Cesspools shall be prohibited, except where approved by the code official. Where approved, cesspools shall be designed and installed in accordance with Chapter 10.
302.3 Industrial wastes.
The code official shall approve the method of treatment and disposal of all waste products from manufacturing or industrial operations, including combined industrial and domestic waste.
302.4 Detrimental or dangerous waste.
Material such as ashes, cinders or rags; flammable, poisonous or explosive liquids or gases; oil, grease or other insoluble material that is capable of obstructing, damaging or overloading the private sewage disposal system, or is capable of interfering with the normal operation of the private sewage disposal system, shall not be deposited, by any means, into such systems. The code official shall approve the method of treatment and disposal.
302.5 Clear water.
The discharge of surface, rain or other clear water into a private sewage disposal system shall be prohibited.
302.6 Water softener and iron filter backwash.
Water softener or iron filter discharge shall be indirectly connected by means of an air gap to the private sewage disposal system or discharge onto the ground surface, provided that a nuisance is not created.
302.7 Food waste disposals.
Where a food waste disposal connects to a private sewage disposal system, the system shall be designed to accommodate the solids loading from the disposal unit.
Section 303 Flood hazard areas
CDP
[BS] 303.1 General.
CDP
Soil absorption systems shall be located outside of flood hazard areas.Exception: Where suitable soil absorption sites outside of the flood hazard area are not available, the soil absorption site is permitted to be located within the flood hazard area. The soil absorption site shall be located to minimize the effects of inundation under conditions of the design flood.
[BS] 303.2 Tanks.
CDP
In flood hazard areas, tanks shall be anchored to counter buoyant forces during condition of the design flood. The vent termination and service manhole of the tank shall be not less than 2 feet (610 mm) above the design flood elevation or fitted with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or outflow of the contents of the tanks during conditions of the design flood.
[BS] 303.3 Mound systems.
CDP
Mound systems shall be prohibited in flood hazard areas.
Section 304 Alternative engineered design
304.1 Alternative engineered design.
The design, documentation, inspection, testing and approval of an alternative engineered design private sewage disposal system shall comply with Sections 304.1.1 through 304.6.
304.1.1 Design criteria.
An alternative engineered design shall conform to the intent of the provisions of this code and shall provide an equivalent level of quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. Material, equipment or components shall be designed and installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
304.2 Submittal.
The registered design professional shall indicate on the permit application that the private sewage disposal system is an alternative engineered design. The permit and permanent permit records shall indicate that an alternative engineered design was part of the approved installation.
304.3 Technical data.
The registered design professional shall submit sufficient technical data to substantiate the proposed alternative engineered design and to prove that the performance meets the intent of this code.
304.4 Construction documents.
The registered design professional shall submit to the code official two complete sets of signed and sealed construction documents for the alternative engineered design.
304.5 Design approval.
Where the code official determines that the alternative engineered design conforms to the intent of this code, the private sewage disposal system shall be approved. If the alternative engineered design is not approved, the code official shall notify the registered design professional in writing, stating the reasons therefor.
304.6 Inspection and test.
The alternative engineered design shall be inspected in accordance with the requirements of Section 111.
