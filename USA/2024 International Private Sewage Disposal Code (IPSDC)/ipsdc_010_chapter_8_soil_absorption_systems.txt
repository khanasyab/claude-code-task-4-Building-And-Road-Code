Chapter 7 Soil Absorption Systems
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 7 regulates the pressure distribution method of soil absorption systems. This type of system is necessary where the water from the outlet of a septic tank cannot flow by gravity because of site constraints. The water is pumped from a collection tank to the absorption area at regular intervals.
Section 701 General
CDP
701.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the design and installation of pressure distribution systems.
Section 702 Design loading rate
702.1 General.
A pressure distribution system shall be permitted for use on any site meeting the conventional private sewage disposal system criteria. There shall be not less than 6 inches (152 mm) to the top of the distribution piping from original grade for any pressure distribution system. The minimum required suitable soil depths from original grade for pressure distribution systems shall be in accordance with Table 702.1.
TABLE 702.1 SOIL REQUIRED
DISTRIBUTION PIPE (inches)
SUITABLE SOIL (inches)
1 49
2 50
3 52
4 53
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm.
702.2 Absorption area.
The total absorption area required shall be computed from the estimated daily wastewater flow and the design loading rate based on the percolation rate for the site. The required absorption area equals wastewater flow divided by the design loading rate from Table 702.2. Two systems of equal size shall be required for systems receiving effluents exceeding 5,000 gallons (18 925 L). Each system shall have a minimum capacity of 75 percent of the area required for a single system and shall be provided with a suitable means of alternating waste applications. A dual system shall be considered as one system.
TABLE 702.2 DESIGN LOADING RATE
PERCOLATION RATE (minutes per inch)
DESIGN LOADING FACTOR (gallons per square foot per day)
0 to less than 10 1.2
10 to less than 30 0.8
30 to less than 45 0.72
45 to 60 0.4
For SI: 1 minute per inch = 2.4 s/mm, 1 gallon per square foot = 0.025 L/m2.
702.3 Estimated wastewater flow.
The estimated wastewater flow from a residence shall be 150 gallons (568 L) per bedroom per day. Wastewater flow rates for other occupancies in a 24-hour period shall be based on the values in Table 802.7.2.
Section 703 System design
703.1 General.
Pressure distribution systems shall discharge effluent into trenches or beds. Each pipe connected to an outlet of a manifold shall be counted as a separate distribution pipe. The horizontal spacing of distribution pipes shall be 30 inches to 72 inches (762 mm to 1829 mm). The system shall be sized in accordance with the formulas listed in this section. Systems using Schedule 40 plastic pipe shall be sized in accordance with the formulas listed in this section or in accordance with the tables listed in Appendix B. Distribution piping shall be installed at the same elevation, unless an approved system provides for a design ensuring equal flow through each of the perforations and the effluent is uniformly applied to the soil infiltrative surface [see Appendix A, Figure A101.1(5)].
703.2 Symbols.
The following symbols and notations shall apply to the provisions of this chapter:Ch = Hazen-Williams friction factor.D = Distribution pipe diameter, inches (mm).d = Perforation diameter, inches (mm).Dd = Delivery pipe diameter, inches (mm).Dm = Manifold pipe diameter, inches (mm).f = Fraction of total head loss in the manifold segment.FD = Friction loss in the delivery pipe, feet of head (mm of head).Fi = Friction factor for ith
manifold segment.FN = Friction loss in the network pipe, feet of head (mm of head).h = Pressure in distribution pipe, feet of head (mm of head).hd = In-line pressure at distal end of lateral, feet of head (mm of head).LD = Length of delivery pipe, feet (mm).Li = Length of ith
manifold segment, feet (mm).N = Number of perforations in the lateral.q = Perforation discharge rate, gpm (L/min).Qi = Flow rate ith
manifold segment, gpm (L/min).Qm = Flow rate at manifold inlet, gpm (L/min).
703.3 Distribution pipe.
Distribution pipe size, hole diameter and hole spacing shall be selected. The hole diameter and spacing shall be equal for each manifold segment. Distribution pipe size shall not be required to be the same for each segment. Changes in pressure in the distribution pipe shall be less than or equal to 10 percent by conforming to the following formula:(Formula 7-1)∑∆h0.2hd For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm. where: ∆h= 4.71L(qChD2.65)1.85
q = 11.79d2 hd
The Hazen-Williams friction factor, Ch, for each pipe material shall be determined in accordance with Table 703.3.
TABLE 703.3 HAZEN-WILLIAMS FRICTION FACTOR
MATERIAL
FRICTION FACTOR, Ch
ABS plastic pipe 150
Asbestos-cement pipe 140
Bituminized fiber pipe 120
Cast-iron pipe 100
Concrete pipe 110
Copper or copper-alloy tubing 150
PVC plastic pipe 150
Vitrified clay pipe 100
703.4 Manifolds.
The diameter of the manifold pipe shall be determined by the following equation:Equation 7-1Dm = (∑LiFifhd)0.21 For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm. where: Fi = 9.8 × 10-4 Qi
q = 11.79d2 hd
Q = Nq
The fraction of the total head loss at the manifold segment,
f, shall be less than or equal to 0.1. The in-line pressure at the distal end of the lateral, hd, shall be not less than 2.5 feet (762 mm) of head. Distribution pipes shall be connected to the manifold with tees or 90-degree (1.57 rad) ells. Distribution pipes shall have the ends capped.
703.5 Friction loss.
The delivery pipe shall include all pipe between the pump and the supply end of the distribution pipe. The friction loss in the delivery pipe,
FD, shall be determined by the following equation:Equation 7-2FD =LD(3.55QmChDd2.63)1.85 For SI: 1 inch of head = 25.4 mm of head.
The Hazen-Williams friction factor, Ch, for each pipe material shall be determined in accordance with Table 703.3. The friction loss in the network pipe shall be determined by the following equation:Equation 7-3FN = 1.31hd For SI: 1 inch of head = 25.4 mm of head.
Pipe in the system shall be increased in size if the friction loss is excessive.
703.6 Force main.
Size of the force main between the pump and manifold shall be based on the friction loss and velocity of effluent through the pipe. The velocity of effluent in a force main shall be not more than 5 feet per second (1524 mm/sec).

Section 705 Pumps
705.1 General.
Pump selection shall be based on the discharge rate and total dynamic head of the pump performance curve. The total dynamic head shall be equal to the difference in feet (mm) of elevation between the pump and distribution pipe invert plus the friction loss and not less than 2.5 feet (762 mm) where using low pressure distribution in the delivery pipe and network pipe.
705.2 Pump and alarm controls.
The control system for the pumping chamber shall consist of a control for operating the pump and an alarm system to detect a pump. Pump start and stop depth controls shall be adjustable. Pump and alarm controls shall be of an approved type. Switches shall be resistant to sewage corrosion.
705.3 Alarm system.
Alarm systems shall consist of a bell or light, mounted in the structure, and shall be located to be easily seen or heard. The high-water sensing device shall be installed approximately 2 inches (51 mm) above the depth set for the “on” pump control but below the bottom of the inlet to the pumping chamber. Alarm systems shall be installed on a separate circuit from the electrical service.
705.4 Electrical connections.
Electrical connections shall be located outside the pumping chamber.
Section 706 Dosing
706.1 General.
The dosing frequency shall be not greater than four times daily. A volume per dose shall be established by dividing the daily wastewater flow by the dosing frequency. The dosing volume shall be not less than 10 times the capacity of the distribution pipe volume. Table 706.1 provides the estimated volume for various pipe diameters.
