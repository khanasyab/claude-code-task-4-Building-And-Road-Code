Chapter 4 Fixtures, Faucets and Fixture Fittings
User notes:
About this chapter: Plumbing fixtures are required to be installed for nearly every building as toilet facilities (water closets and lavatories) are needed by the occupants of a building. Additional fixtures for washing, bathing and culinary purposes are also necessary where occupants dwell in buildings. Chapter 4 specifies the minimum number and type of plumbing fixtures for buildings based on the description of use of the building. Because fixture design and quality are paramount to ensure that plumbing fixtures operate properly, this chapter also specifies numerous product and material standards for plumbing fixtures.
Section 401 General
