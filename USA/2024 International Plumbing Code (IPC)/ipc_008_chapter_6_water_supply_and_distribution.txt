Chapter 5 Water Heaters
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 5 contains regulations concerning the safety of water heating units and hot water storage tanks. Heated (hot or tempered) potable water is needed for plumbing fixtures that are associated with handwashing, bathing, culinary activities and building maintenance. Heated water is commonly stored in large pressurized storage tanks that must be protected against explosion by pressure and temperature relief valves specified in this chapter. This chapter also covers the access requirements to water heaters and hot water storage tanks to allow for the maintenance and replacement of that equipment.
Section 501 General
