Chapter 11 Storm Drainage
User notes:
About this chapter: Rainfall onto buildings must be removed and directed to a location that can accommodate storm water. Chapter 11 specifies the design rainfall event for the geographic area and provides sizing methods for piping and gutter systems to convey the storm water away from the building. Included in this chapter are regulations for piping materials and subsoil drainage systems.
Section 1101 General
CDP
1101.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, design, construction and installation of storm drainage.
1101.2 Disposal.
Rainwater from roofs and storm water from paved areas, yards, courts and courtyards shall drain to an approved place of disposal. For one- and two-family dwellings, and where approved, storm water is permitted to discharge onto flat areas, such as streets or lawns, provided that the storm water flows away from the building.
1101.3 Prohibited drainage.
Storm water shall not be drained into sewers intended for sewage only.
1101.4 Tests.

CDP
Roofs shall be designed for the maximum possible depth of water that will pond thereon as determined by the relative levels of roof deck and overflow weirs, scuppers, edges or serviceable drains in combination with the deflected structural elements. In determining the maximum possible depth of water, all primary roof drainage means shall be assumed to be blocked. The maximum possible depth of water on the roof shall include the height of the water required above the inlet of the secondary roof drainage means to achieve the required flow rate of the secondary drainage means to accommodate the design rainfall rate as required by Section 1106.
