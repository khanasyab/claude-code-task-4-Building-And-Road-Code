Chapter 7 Sanitary Drainage
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 7 regulates the methods and piping systems that remove water that has served a purpose such as flushing water closets, bathing, culinary activities and equipment discharges. The types of materials, drainage fitting and the connection methods are covered for these systems that begin at the receiving fixtures and end at the point of disposal for the liquid waste. A design method for a gravity flow system of vertical and horizontal piping is provided based on the probability of flows from specific fixtures. Vacuum and pumped types of liquid waste removal methods are also regulated by this chapter.
Section 701 General
CDP
701.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, design, construction and installation of sanitary drainage systems.
701.2 Connection to sewer required.
Sanitary drainage piping from plumbing fixtures in buildings and sanitary drainage piping systems from premises shall be connected to a public sewer. Where a public sewer is not available, the sanitary drainage piping and systems shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system in compliance with state or local requirements. Where state or local requirements do not exist for private sewage disposal systems, the sanitary drainage piping and systems shall be connected to an approved private sewage disposal system that is in accordance with the International Private Sewage Disposal Code.Exception: Sanitary drainage piping and systems that convey only the discharge from bathtubs, showers, lavatories, clothes washers and laundry trays shall not be required to connect to a public sewer or to a private sewage disposal system provided that the piping or systems are connected to a system in accordance with Chapter 13 or 14.
701.3 Separate sewer connection.
A building having plumbing fixtures installed and intended for human habitation, occupancy or use on premises abutting on a street, alley or easement in which there is a public sewer shall have a separate connection with the sewer. Where located on the same lot, multiple buildings shall not be prohibited from connecting to a common building sewer that connects to the public sewer.
701.4 Sewage treatment.
Sewage or other waste from a plumbing system that is deleterious to surface or subsurface waters shall not be discharged into the ground or into any waterway unless it has first been rendered innocuous through subjection to an approved form of treatment.
701.5 Damage to drainage system or public sewer.
Waste detrimental to the public sewer system or to the functioning of the sewage-treatment plant shall be treated and disposed of in accordance with Section 1003 as directed by the code official.
701.6 Tests.
The sanitary drainage system shall be tested in accordance with Section 312.
