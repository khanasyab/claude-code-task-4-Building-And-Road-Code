Chapter 6 Water Supply and Distribution
User notes:
About this chapter: Many plumbing fixtures require a supply of potable water. Other fixtures could be supplied with nonpotable water such as reclaimed water. Chapter 6 covers the requirements for water distribution piping systems to and within buildings. The regulations include the types of materials and the connection methods for such systems. The prevention of backflow of contaminated or polluted water into any potable water system is critical for protection of users of potable water. This chapter regulates the assemblies, devices and methods that are used for this purpose.
Section 601 General
CDP
601.1 Scope.
CDP
This chapter shall govern the materials, design and installation of water supply systems, both hot and cold, for utilization in connection with human occupancy and habitation and shall govern the installation of individual water supply systems.
601.2 Solar energy utilization.
Solar energy systems used for heating potable water or using an independent medium for heating potable water shall comply with the applicable requirements of this code. The use of solar energy shall not compromise the requirements for cross connection or protection of the potable water supply system required by this code.
601.3 Existing piping used for grounding.
Existing metallic water service piping used for electrical grounding shall not be replaced with nonmetallic pipe or tubing until other approved means of grounding is provided.
601.4 Tests.
The potable water distribution system shall be tested in accordance with Section 312.6.
601.5 Rehabilitation of piping systems.
Where pressure piping systems are rehabilitated using an epoxy lining system, such lining system shall comply with ASTM F2831.
Section 602 Water Required
602.1 General.
Structures equipped with plumbing fixtures and utilized for human occupancy or habitation shall be provided with a potable supply of water in the amounts and at the pressures specified in this chapter.
602.2 Potable water required.
CDP
Only potable water shall be supplied to plumbing fixtures that provide water for drinking, bathing or culinary purposes, or for the processing of food, medical or pharmaceutical products. Unless otherwise provided in this code, potable water shall be supplied to all plumbing fixtures.
602.3 Individual water supply.
Where a potable public water supply is not available, individual sources of potable water supply shall be utilized.
602.3.1 Sources.
Dependent on geological and soil conditions and the amount of rainfall, individual water supplies are of the following types: drilled well, driven well, dug well, bored well, spring, stream or cistern. Surface bodies of water and land cisterns shall not be sources of individual water supply unless properly treated by approved means to prevent contamination. Individual water supplies shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the applicable state and local laws. Where such laws do not address all of the requirements set forth in NGWA-01, individual water supplies shall comply with NGWA-01 for those requirements not addressed by state and local laws.
602.3.2 Minimum quantity.
The combined capacity of the source and storage in an individual water supply system shall supply the fixtures with water at rates and pressures as required by this chapter.
602.3.3 Water quality.
Water from an individual water supply shall be approved as potable by the authority having jurisdiction prior to connection to the plumbing system.
602.3.4 Disinfection of system.
After construction, the individual water supply system shall be purged of deleterious matter and disinfected in accordance with Section 610.
602.3.5 Pumps.
Pumps shall be rated for the transport of potable water. Pumps in an individual water supply system shall be constructed and installed so as to prevent contamination from entering a potable water supply through the pump units. Pumps intended to supply drinking water shall conform to NSF 61. Pumps shall be sealed to the well casing or covered with a watertight seal. Pumps shall be designed to maintain a prime and installed such that ready access is provided to the pump parts of the entire assembly for repairs.
602.3.5.1 Pump enclosure.
The pump room or enclosure around a well pump shall be drained and protected from freezing by heating or other approved means. Where pumps are installed in basements, such pumps shall be mounted on a block or shelf not less than 18 inches (457 mm) above the basement floor. Well pits shall be prohibited.
Section 603 Water Service
