Chapter 10 Traps, Interceptors and Separators
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 10 regulates the design of fixture traps, methods for preventing evaporation of trap seals in traps and the required locations for interceptors and separators. The trap seal of a trap is an essential feature of a drainage system to prevent odors from the drainage piping from entering the building. The discharge of various processes, such as cooking and laundry, creates the need for equipment to retain detrimental greases and solids from entering the drainage systems.
