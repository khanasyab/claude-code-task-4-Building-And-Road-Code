Chapter 9 Vents
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 9 regulates connection locations, various venting system arrangements and the sizing of piping for vent systems. The proper operation of a gravity flow drainage system (Chapter 7) depends on maintaining an air path throughout the system to prevent waste and odor “blow back” into fixtures and siphoning of the trap seal in fixture traps (Chapter 10).
