Chapter 8 Indirect/Special Waste
User notes:
About this chapter: There are drainage applications in buildings where a backup of liquid waste in a drainage system could contaminate equipment and appliances. Chapter 8 covers the applications that require an indirect discharge connection to the building’s drainage system. The chapter has provisions for the types of indirect connections and waste receptor configurations.
Section 801 General
CDP
801.1 Scope.
CDP
This chapter shall govern matters concerning indirect waste piping and special wastes. This chapter shall further control matters concerning food-handling establishments, sterilizers, humidifiers, clear-water waste, swimming pools, methods of providing air breaks or air gaps, and neutralizing devices for corrosive wastes.
801.2 Protection.
Devices, appurtenances, appliances and apparatus intended to serve some special function, such as sterilization, humidification, distillation, processing, cooling, or storage of ice or foods, and that discharge to the drainage system, shall be provided with protection against backflow, flooding, fouling, contamination and stoppage of the drain.
Section 802 Indirect Wastes
802.1 Where required.
INSIGHTS
Food-handling equipment, in other than dwelling units, clear-water waste, humidifiers, dishwashing machines and utensils, pots, pans and dishwashing sinks shall discharge through an indirect waste pipe as specified in Sections 802.1.1 through 802.1.7. Fixtures not required to be indirectly connected by this section and the exception to Section 301.6 shall be directly connected to the plumbing system in accordance with Chapter 7. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.1 Food handling.
INSIGHTS
Equipment and fixtures utilized for the storage, preparation and handling of food shall discharge through an indirect waste pipe by means of an air gap. Each well of a multiple-compartment sink shall discharge independently to a waste receptor. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.2 Floor drains in food storage areas.
INSIGHTS
Floor drains located within walk-in refrigerators or freezers in food service and food establishments shall be indirectly connected to the sanitary drainage system by means of an air gap. Where a floor drain is located within an area subject to freezing, the waste line serving the floor drain shall not be trapped and shall indirectly discharge into a waste receptor located outside of the area subject to freezing.Exception: Where protected against backflow by a backwater valve, such floor drains shall be indirectly connected to the sanitary drainage system by means of an air break or an air gap. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.3 Potable clear-water waste.
INSIGHTS
Where devices and equipment, such as sterilizers and relief valves, discharge potable water to the building drainage system, the discharge shall be through an indirect waste pipe by means of an air gap. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.4 Swimming pools.
INSIGHTS
Where wastewater from swimming pools, backwash from filters and water from pool deck drains discharge to the building drainage system, the discharge shall be through an indirect waste pipe by means of an air gap. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.5 Nonpotable clear-water waste.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Where devices and equipment such as process tanks, filters, drips and boilers discharge nonpotable water to the building drainage system, the discharge shall be through an indirect waste pipe by means of an air break or an air gap. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.6 Commercial dishwashing machines.
INSIGHTS
The discharge from a commercial dishwashing machine shall be through an air gap or air break into a waste receptor in accordance with Section 802.3. INSIGHTS (1)
802.1.7 Food utensils, dishes, pots and pans sinks.
INSIGHTS
Sinks, in other than dwelling units, used for the washing, rinsing or sanitizing of utensils, dishes, pots, pans or service ware used in the preparation, serving or eating of food shall discharge indirectly through an air gap or an air break to the drainage system. INSIGHTS (1)
802.2 Material, joints and connections.
INSIGHTS
The materials, joints, connections and methods utilized for the construction and installation of indirect waste piping systems shall comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter 7. INSIGHTS (1)
802.3 Installation.
INSIGHTS
Indirect waste piping shall discharge through an air gap or air break into a waste receptor. Waste receptors shall be trapped and vented and shall connect to the building drainage system. Indirect waste piping that exceeds 30 inches (762 mm) in developed length measured horizontally, or 54 inches (1372 mm) in total developed length, shall be trapped.Exception: Where a waste receptor receives only clearwater waste and does not directly connect to a sanitary drainage system, the receptor shall not require a trap. INSIGHTS (1)
802.3.1 Air gap.
INSIGHTS
The air gap between the indirect waste pipe and the flood level rim of the waste receptor shall be not less than twice the effective opening of the indirect waste pipe. INSIGHTS (1)
802.3.2 Air break.
INSIGHTS
An air break shall be provided between the indirect waste pipe and the trap seal of the waste receptor. INSIGHTS (1)
802.4 Waste receptors.
CDP
INSIGHTS
For other than hub drains that receive only clear-water waste and standpipes, a removable strainer or basket shall cover the outlet of waste receptors. Waste receptors shall not be installed in concealed spaces. Waste receptors shall not be installed in plenums, crawl spaces, attics, interstitial spaces above ceilings and below floors. Ready access shall be provided to waste receptors. INSIGHTS (1)
802.4.1 Size of receptors.
INSIGHTS
A waste receptor shall be sized for the maximum discharge of all indirect waste pipes served by the receptor. Receptors shall be installed to prevent splashing or flooding. INSIGHTS (1)
802.4.2 Hub drains.
INSIGHTS
A hub drain shall be in the form of a hub or a pipe extending not less than 1 inch (25 mm) above a water-impervious floor. INSIGHTS (1)
802.4.3 Standpipes.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Standpipes shall be individually trapped. Standpipes shall extend not less than 18 inches (457 mm) but not greater than 42 inches (1067 mm) above the trap weir. Access shall be provided to standpipes and drains for rodding. INSIGHTS (1)
802.4.3.1 Connection of laundry tray to standpipe.
INSIGHTS
As an alternative for a laundry tray fixture connecting directly to a drainage system, a laundry tray waste line without a fixture trap shall connect to a standpipe for an automatic clothes washer drain. The standpipe shall extend not less than 30 inches (762 mm) above the weir of the standpipe trap and shall extend above the flood level rim of the laundry tray. The outlet of the laundry tray shall not be greater than 30 inches (762 mm) horizontal distance from the side of the standpipe. INSIGHTS (1)
Section 803 Special Wastes
803.1 Neutralizing device required for corrosive wastes.
Corrosive liquids, spent acids or other harmful chemicals that destroy or injure a drain, sewer, soil or waste pipe, or create noxious or toxic fumes or interfere with sewage treatment processes shall not be discharged into the plumbing system without being thoroughly diluted, neutralized or treated by passing through an approved dilution or neutralizing device. Such devices shall be automatically provided with a sufficient supply of diluting water or neutralizing medium so as to make the contents noninjurious before discharge into the drainage system. The nature of the corrosive or harmful waste and the method of its treatment or dilution shall be approved prior to installation.
803.2 System design.
A chemical drainage and vent system shall be designed and installed in accordance with this code. Chemical drainage and vent systems shall be completely separated from the sanitary systems. Chemical waste shall not discharge to a sanitary drainage system until such waste has been treated in accordance with Section 803.1.
