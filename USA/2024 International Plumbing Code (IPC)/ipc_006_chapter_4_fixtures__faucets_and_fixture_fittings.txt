Chapter 3 General Regulations
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 3 covers general regulations for plumbing installations. As many of these requirements would need to be repeated in Chapters 3 through 14, placing such requirements in only one location eliminates code development coordination issues associated with the same requirement in multiple locations. These general requirements can be superseded by more specific requirements for certain applications in Chapters 3 through 14.
