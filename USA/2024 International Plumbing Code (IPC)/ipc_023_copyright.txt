Appendix E Sizing of Water Piping System
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix: The sizing of water service and water distribution piping is not specified in Chapter 6 as it is left up to the designer of the system with the code official approving the design method. Appendix E provides several methods that could be used by a system designer.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections in this appendix will be considered by the IPC Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle.
Section E101 General
E101.1 Scope.
E101.1.1 Two procedures.
This appendix outlines two procedures for sizing a water piping system (see Sections E103.3 and E104.1). The design procedures are based on the minimum static pressure available from the supply source, the head changes in the system caused by friction and elevation, and the rates of flow necessary for operation of various fixtures.
E101.1.2 Variable conditions.
Because of the variable conditions encountered in hydraulic design, it is impractical to specify definite and detailed rules for sizing of the water piping system. Accordingly, other sizing or design methods conforming to good engineering practice standards are acceptable alternatives to those presented herein.
Section E102 Information Required
E102.1 Preliminary.
Obtain the necessary information regarding the minimum daily static service pressure in the area where the building is to be located. If the building supply is to be metered, obtain information regarding friction loss relative to the rate of flow for meters in the range of sizes likely to be used. Friction loss data can be obtained from most manufacturers of water meters.
E102.2 Demand load.
E102.2.1 Fixture demand.
Estimate the supply demand of the building main and the principal branches and risers of the system by totaling the corresponding demand from the applicable part of Table E103.3(3).
E102.2.2 Continuous demand.
Estimate continuous supply demands in gallons per minute (L/m) for items such as lawn sprinklers and air conditioners, and add the sum to the total demand for fixtures. The result is the estimated supply demand for the building supply.
Section E103 Selection of Pipe Size
CDP
E103.1 General.
Decide from Table 604.3 what is the desirable minimum residual pressure that should be maintained at the highest fixture in the supply system. If the highest group of fixtures contains flushometer valves, the pressure for the group should be not less than 15 pounds per square inch (psi) (103.4 kPa) flowing. For flush tank supplies, the available pressure should be not less than 8 psi (55.2 kPa) flowing, except blowout action fixtures must be not less than 25 psi (172.4 kPa) flowing.
E103.2 Pipe sizing.
E103.2.1 Pipe size selection.
Pipe sizes can be selected according to the following procedure or by other design methods conforming to acceptable engineering practice and approved by the administrative authority. The sizes selected must not be less than the minimum required by this code.
E103.2.2 Pressures and losses.
Water pipe sizing procedures are based on a system of pressure requirements and losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the supply source. These pressures are as follows:1.Pressure required at fixture to produce required flow. See Sections 604.3 and 604.5.2.Static pressure loss or gain (due to head) is computed at 0.433 psi per foot (9.8 kPa/m) of elevation change. Example: Assume that the highest fixture supply outlet is 20 feet (6096 mm) above or below the supply source. This produces a static pressure differential of 20 feet by 0.433 psi/foot (2096 mm by 9.8 kPa/m) and an 8.66 psi (59.8 kPa) loss. 3.Loss through water meter. The friction or pressure loss can be obtained from meter manufacturers.4.Loss through taps in water main.5.Losses through special devices such as filters, softeners, backflow prevention devices and pressure regulators. These values must be obtained from the manufacturers.6.Loss through valves and fittings. Losses for these items are calculated by converting to equivalent length of piping and adding to the total pipe length.7.Loss due to pipe friction can be calculated where the pipe size, the pipe length and the flow through the pipe are known. With these three items, the friction loss can be determined. For piping flow charts not included, use manufacturers’ tables and velocity recommendations.8.For the purposes of all examples, the following metric conversions are applicable: 1 cubic foot per minute = 0.4719 L/s 1 square foot = 0.0929 m2 1 degree = 0.0175 rad 1 pound per square inch = 6.895 kPa 1 inch = 25.4 mm 1 foot = 304.8 mm 1 gallon per minute = 3.785 L/m
E103.3 Segmented loss method.
The size of water service mains, branch
mains and risers by the segmented loss method must be determined according to water supply demand [gpm (L/m)], available water pressure [psi (kPa)] and friction loss caused by the water meter and developed length
of pipe [feet (m)], including equivalent length of fittings. The design procedure is based on the following parameters: Calculated friction loss through each length of the pipe. A system of pressure losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the street main or other source of supply. The estimated peak demand, total pressure losses caused by difference in elevation, equipment, developed length and pressure required at most remote fixture, loss through taps in water main, losses through fittings, filters, backflow prevention devices, valves and pipe friction. Because of the variable conditions encountered in hydraulic design, it is impractical to specify definite and detailed rules for sizing of the water piping system. Current sizing methods do not address the differences in the probability of use and flow characteristics of fixtures between types of occupancies. Creating an exact model of predicting the demand for a building is impossible and final studies assessing the impact of water conservation on demand are not yet complete. The following steps are necessary for the segmented loss method.1.Preliminary. Obtain the necessary information regarding the minimum daily static service pressure in the area where the building is to be located. If the building supply is to be metered, obtain information regarding friction loss relative to the rate of flow for meters in the range of sizes to be used. Friction loss data can be obtained from manufacturers of water meters. It is essential that enough pressure be available to overcome all system losses caused by friction and elevation so that plumbing fixtures operate properly. Section 604.6 requires the water distribution system to be designed for the minimum pressure available taking into consideration pressure fluctuations. The lowest pressure must be selected to guarantee a continuous, adequate supply of water. The lowest pressure in the public main usually occurs in the summer because of lawn sprinkling and supplying water for air-conditioning cooling towers. Future demands placed on the public main as a result of large growth or expansion should be considered. The available pressure will decrease as additional loads are placed on the public system.2.Demand load. Estimate the supply demand of the building main and the principal branches and risers of the system by totaling the corresponding demand from the applicable part of Table E103.3(3). When estimating peak demand sizing methods typically use water supply fixture units (w.s.f.u.) [see Table E103.3(2)]. This numerical factor measures the load-producing effect of a single plumbing fixture of a given kind. The use of such fixture units can be applied to a single basic probability curve (or table), found in the various sizing methods [Table E103.3(3)]. The fixture units are then converted into gallons per minute (L/m) flow rate for estimating demand.2.1.Estimate continuous supply demand in gallons per minute (L/m) for items such as lawn sprinklers and air conditioners, and add the sum to the total demand for fixtures. The result is the estimated supply demand for the building supply. Fixture units cannot be applied to constant use fixtures such as hose bibbs, lawn sprinklers and air conditioners. These types of fixtures must be assigned the gallon per minute (L/m) value.3.Selection of pipe size. This water pipe sizing procedure is based on a system of pressure requirements and losses, the sum of which must not exceed the minimum pressure available at the supply source. These pressures are as follows:3.1.Pressure required at the fixture to produce required flow. See Sections 604.3 and 604.5.3.2.Static pressure loss or gain (because of head) is computed at 0.433 psi per foot (9.8 kPa/m) of elevation change.3.3.Loss through a water meter. The friction or pressure loss can be obtained from the manufacturer.3.4.Loss through taps in water main [see Table E103.3(4)].3.5.Losses through special devices such as filters, softeners, backflow prevention devices and pressure regulators. These values must be obtained from the manufacturers.3.6.Loss through valves and fittings [see Tables E103.3(5) and E103.3(6)]. Losses for these items are calculated by converting to equivalent length of piping and adding to the total pipe length.3.7.Loss caused by pipe friction can be calculated where the pipe size, the pipe length and the flow through the pipe are known. With these three items, the friction loss can be determined using Figures E103.3(2) through E103.3(7). When using charts, use pipe inside diameters. For piping flow charts not included, use manufacturers’ tables and velocity recommendations. Before attempting to size any water supply system, it is necessary to gather preliminary information that includes available pressure, piping material, select design velocity, elevation differences and developed length
to most remote fixture. The water supply system is divided into sections at major changes in elevation or where branches
lead to fixture groups. The peak demand must be determined in each part of the hot and cold water supply system that includes the corresponding water supply fixture unit and conversion to gallons per minute (L/m) flow rate to be expected through each section. Sizing methods require the determination of the “most hydraulically remote” fixture to compute the pressure loss caused by pipe and fittings. The hydraulically remote fixture represents the most downstream fixture along the circuit of piping requiring the most available pressure to operate properly. Consideration must be given to all pressure demands and losses, such as friction caused by pipe, fittings and equipment, elevation and the residual pressure required by Table 604.3. The two most common and frequent complaints about the water supply system operation are lack of adequate pressure and noise.

E103.3.1 Sample problem.
What size Type L copper water pipe, service and distribution will be required to serve a two-story factory building having on each floor, back-to-back, two toilet rooms each equipped with hot and cold water? The highest fixture is 21 feet (6401 mm) above the street main, which is tapped with a 2-inch (51 mm) corporation cock at which point the minimum pressure is 55 psi (379.2 kPa). In the building basement, a 2-inch (51 mm) meter with a maximum pressure drop of 11 psi (75.8 kPa) and 3-inch (76 mm) reduced pressure principle backflow preventer with a maximum pressure drop of 9 psi (621 kPa) are to be installed. The system is shown by  Figure E103.3(1) . To be determined are the pipe sizes for the service main and the cold and hot water distribution pipes.Problem Solution: A tabular arrangement such as shown in Table E103.3(1) should first be constructed. The steps to be followed are indicated by the tabular arrangement itself as they are in sequence, Columns 1 through 10 and Lines A through L.Step 1 Columns 1 and 2: Divide the system into sections breaking at major changes in elevation or where branches lead to fixture groups. After point B [see Figure E103.3(1)], separate consideration will be given to the hot and cold water piping. Enter the sections to be considered in the service and cold water piping in Column 1 of the tabular arrangement. Column 1 of Table E103.3(1) provides a line-by-line recommended tabular arrangement for use in solving pipe sizing.The objective in designing the water supply system is to ensure an adequate water supply and pressure to all fixtures and equipment. Column 2 provides the pounds per square inch (psi) to be considered separately from the minimum pressure available at the main. Losses to take into consideration are the following: the differences in elevation between the water supply source and the highest water supply outlet, meter pressure losses, the tap in main loss, special fixture devices such as water softeners and backflow prevention devices and the pressure required at the most remote fixture outlet. The difference in elevation can result in an increase or decrease in available pressure at the main. Where the water supply outlet is located above the source, this results in a loss in the available pressure and is subtracted from the pressure at the water source. Where the highest water supply outlet is located below the water supply source, there will be an increase in pressure that is added to the available pressure of the water source.Column 3: According to Table E103.3(3), determine the gpm (L/m) of flow to be expected in each section of the system. These flows range from 28.6 to 108 gpm. Load values for fixtures must be determined as water supply fixture units and then converted to a gallon-per-minute (gpm) rating to determine peak demand. When calculating peak demands, the water supply fixture units are added and then converted to the gallon-per-minute rating. For continuous flow fixtures such as hose bibbs and lawn sprinkler systems, add the gallon-per-minute demand to the intermittent demand of fixtures. For example, a total of 120 water supply fixture units is converted to a demand of 48 gallons per minute. Two hose bibbs × 5 gpm demand = 10 gpm. Total gpm rating = 48.0 gpm + 10 gpm = 58.0 gpm demand.Step 2 Line A: Enter the minimum pressure available at the main source of supply in Column 2. This is 55 psi (379.2 kPa). The local water authorities generally keep records of pressures at different times of day and year. The available pressure can be checked from nearby buildings or from fire department hydrant checks.Line B: Determine from  Table 604.3 the highest pressure required for the fixtures on the system, which is 15 psi (103.4 kPa), to operate a flushometer valve. The most remote fixture outlet is necessary to compute the pressure loss caused by pipe and fittings, and represents the most downstream fixture along the circuit of piping requiring the available pressure to operate properly as indicated by Table 604.3.Line C: Determine the pressure loss for the meter size given or assumed. The total water flow from the main through the service as determined in Step 1 will serve to aid in the meter selected. There are three common types of water meters; the pressure losses are determined by the American Water Works Association Standards for displacement type, compound type and turbine type. The maximum pressure loss of such devices takes into consideration the meter size, safe operating capacity (gpm) and maximum rates for continuous operations (gpm). Typically, equipment imparts greater pressure losses than piping.Line D: Select from Table E103.3(4) and enter the pressure loss for the tap size given or assumed. The loss of pressure through taps and tees in pounds per square inch (psi) is based on the total gallon-per-minute flow rate and size of the tap.Line E: Determine the difference in elevation between the main and source of supply and the highest fixture on the system. Multiply this figure, expressed in feet, by 0.43 psi (2.9 kPa). Enter the resulting psi loss on Line E. The difference in elevation between the water supply source and the highest water supply outlet has a significant impact on the sizing of the water supply system. The difference in elevation usually results in a loss in the available pressure because the water supply outlet is generally located above the water supply source. The loss is caused by the pressure required to lift the water to the outlet. The pressure loss is subtracted from the pressure at the water source. Where the highest water supply outlet is located below the water source, there will be an increase in pressure that is added to the available pressure of the water source.Lines F, G and H: The pressure losses through filters, backflow prevention devices or other special fixtures must be obtained from the manufacturer or estimated and entered on these lines. Equipment such as backflow prevention devices, check valves, water softeners, instantaneous or tankless water heaters, filters and strainers can impart a much greater pressure loss than the piping. The pressure losses can range from 8 psi to 30 psi.Step 3 Line I: The sum of the pressure requirements and losses that affect the overall system (Lines B through H) is entered on this line. Summarizing the steps, all of the system losses are subtracted from the minimum water pressure. The remainder is the pressure available for friction, defined as the energy available to push the water through the pipes to each fixture. This force can be used as an average pressure loss, as long as the pressure available for friction is not exceeded. Saving a certain amount for available water supply pressures as an area incurs growth, or because of aging of the pipe or equipment added to the system is recommended.Step 4 Line J: Subtract Line I from Line A. This gives the pressure that remains available from overcoming friction losses in the system. This figure is a guide to the pipe size that is chosen for each section, incorporating the total friction losses to the most remote outlet (measured length is called developed length).Exception: Where the main is above the highest fixture, the resulting psi must be considered a pressure gain (static head gain) and omitted from the sums of Lines B through H and added to Line J. The maximum friction head loss that can be tolerated in the system during peak demand is the difference between the static pressure at the highest and most remote outlet at no-flow conditions and the minimum flow pressure required at that outlet. If the losses are within the required limits, then every run of pipe will be within the required friction head loss. Static pressure loss is the most remote outlet in feet × 0.433 = loss in psi caused by elevation differences.Step 5 Column 4: Enter the length of each section from the main to the most remote outlet (at Point E). Divide the water supply system into sections breaking at major changes in elevation or where branches lead to fixture groups.Step 6 Column 5: When selecting a trial pipe size, the length from the water service or meter to the most remote fixture outlet must be measured to determine the developed length. However, in systems having a flushometer valve or temperature controlled shower at the topmost floors the developed length would be from the water meter to the most remote flushometer valve on the system. A rule of thumb is that size will become progressively smaller as the system extends farther from the main source of supply. The following formula is an acceptable method to determine trial pipe size:Line J: (Pressure available to overcome pipe friction) × 100/equivalent length of run total developed length to most remote fixture × percentage factor of 1.5 (Note: a percentage factor is used only as an estimate for friction losses imposed for fittings for initial trial pipe size) = psi (average pressure drops per 100 feet of pipe).For trial pipe size, see Figure E103.3(3) (Type L copper) based on 2.77 psi and a 108 gpm = 2 1/2 inches. To determine the equivalent length of run to the most remote outlet, the developed length is determined and added to the friction losses for fittings and valves. The developed lengths of the designated pipe sections are shown in Table E103.3.1(1) .The equivalent length of the friction loss in fittings and valves must be added to the developed length (most remote outlet). Where the size of fittings and valves is not known, the added friction loss should be approximated. A general rule that has been used is to add 50 percent of the developed length to allow for fittings and valves. For example, the equivalent length of run equals the developed length of run (225 ft × 1.5 = 338 ft). The total equivalent length of run for determining a trial pipe size is 338 feet.Example: 9.36 (pressure available to overcome pipe friction) × 100/338 (equivalent length of run = 225 × 1.5) = 2.77 psi (average pressure drop per 100 feet of pipe).Step 7 Column 6: Select from Table E103.3(6) the equivalent lengths for the trial pipe size of fittings and valves on each pipe section. Enter the sum for each section in Column 6. (The number of fittings to be used in this example must be an estimate.) The equivalent length of piping is the developed length plus the equivalent lengths of pipe corresponding to friction head losses for fittings and valves. Where the size of fittings and valves is not known, the added friction head losses must be approximated. An estimate for this example is found in Table E103.3.1(2).Step 8  Column 7: Add the figures from Column 4 and Column 6, and enter in Column 7. Express the sum in hundreds of feet.Step 9  Column 8: Select from Figure E103.3(3) the friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) of pipe for the gallon-per-minute flow in a section (Column 3) and trial pipe size (Column 5). Maximum friction head loss per 100 feet is determined on the basis of total pressure available for friction head loss and the longest equivalent length of run. The selection is based on the gallon-per-minute demand, the uniform friction head loss and the maximum design velocity. Where the size indicated by hydraulic table indicates a velocity in excess of the selected velocity, a size must be selected that produces the required velocity.Step 10  Column 9: Multiply the figures in Columns 7 and 8 for each section and enter in Column 9.Total friction loss is determined by multiplying the friction loss per 100 feet (30 480 mm) for each pipe section in the total developed length by the pressure loss in fittings expressed as equivalent length in feet. Note: Section C-F should be considered in the total pipe friction losses only if greater loss occurs in Section C-F than in pipe section D-E. Section C-F is not considered in the total developed length. Total friction loss in equivalent length is determined in Table E103.3.1(3).Step 11 Line K: Enter the sum of the values in Column 9. The value is the total friction loss in equivalent length for each designated pipe section.Step 12  Line L: Subtract Line J from Line K and enter in Column 10.The result should always be a positive or plus figure. If it is not, repeat the operation using Columns 5, 6, 8 and 9 until a balance or near balance is obtained. If the difference between Lines J and K is a high positive number, it is an indication that the pipe sizes are too large and should be reduced, thus saving materials. In such a case, the operations using Columns 5, 6, 8 and 9 should again be repeated.The total friction losses are determined and subtracted from the pressure available to overcome pipe friction for trial pipe size. This number is critical as it provides a guide to whether the pipe size selected is too large and the process should be repeated to obtain an economically designed system.Answer: The final figures entered in Column 5 become the design pipe size for the respective sections. Repeating this operation a second time using the same sketch but considering the demand for hot water, it is possible to size the hot water distribution piping. This has been worked up as a part of the overall problem in the tabular arrangement used for sizing the service and water distribution piping. Note that consideration must be given to the pressure losses from the street main to the water heater (Section A-B) in determining the hot water pipe sizes.

Section E104 Selection of Pipe Size
E104.1 Size of water service mains, branch mains and risers.
The minimum size water service pipe shall be 3/4 inch (19.1 mm). The size of water service mains, branch mains and risers shall be determined according to water supply demand [gpm (L/m)], available water pressure [psi (kPa)] and friction loss due to the water meter and developed length of pipe [feet (m)], including equivalent length of fittings. The size of each water distribution system shall be determined according to the procedure outlined in this section or by other design methods conforming to acceptable engineering practice and approved by the code official:1.Supply load in the building water distribution system shall be determined by total load on the pipe being sized, in terms of water-supply fixture units (w.s.f.u.), as shown in Table E103.3(2). For fixtures not listed, choose a w.s.f.u. value of a fixture with similar flow characteristics.2.Obtain the minimum daily static service pressure [psi (kPa)] available (as determined by the local water authority) at the water meter or other source of supply at the installation location. Adjust this minimum daily static pressure [psi (kPa)] for the following conditions:2.1.Determine the difference in elevation between the source of supply and the highest water supply outlet. Where the highest water supply outlet is located above the source of supply, deduct 0.5 psi (3.4 kPa) for each foot (0.3 m) of difference in elevation. Where the highest water supply outlet is located below the source of supply, add 0.5 psi (3.4 kPa) for each foot (0.3 m) of difference in elevation.2.2.Where a water pressure-reducing valve is installed in the water distribution system, the minimum daily static water pressure available is 80 percent of the minimum daily static water pressure at the source of supply or the set pressure downstream of the pressure-reducing valve, whichever is smaller.2.3.Deduct all pressure losses due to special equipment such as a backflow preventer, water filter and water softener. Pressure loss data for each piece of equipment shall be obtained through the manufacturer of such devices.2.4.Deduct the pressure in excess of 8 psi (55 kPa) due to installation of the special plumbing fixture, such as temperature controlled shower and flushometer tank water closet. Using the resulting minimum available pressure, find the corresponding pressure range in Table E104.1.3.The maximum developed length for water piping is the actual length of pipe between the source of supply and the most remote fixture, including either hot (through the water heater) or cold water branches multiplied by a factor of 1.2 to compensate for pressure loss through fittings. Select the appropriate column in Table E104.1 equal to or greater than the calculated maximum developed length.4.To determine the size of water service pipe, meter and main distribution pipe to the building using the appropriate table, follow down the selected “maximum developed length” column to a fixture unit equal to, or greater than the total installation demand calculated by using the “combined” water supply fixture unit column of Table E103.3(2). Read the water service pipe and meter sizes in the first left-hand column and the main distribution pipe to the building in the second left-hand column on the same row.5.To determine the size of each water distribution pipe, start at the most remote outlet on each branch (either hot or cold branch) and, working back toward the main distribution pipe to the building, add up the water supply fixture unit demand passing through each segment of the distribution system using the related hot or cold column of Table E103.3(2). Knowing demand, the size of each segment shall be read from the second left-hand column of the same table and maximum developed length column selected in Steps 1 and 2, under the same or next smaller size meter row. The size of any branch or main does not need to be larger than the size of the main distribution pipe to the building established in Step 4.
