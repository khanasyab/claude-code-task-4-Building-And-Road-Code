Appendix CJ Electrical Energy Storage System
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
This voluntary appendix provides requirements for electric energy storage readiness provisions.
Section CJ101 Electrical Energy Storage System
CJ101.1 Electrical energy storage system.
Buildings shall comply with Section CJ101.1.1 or CJ101.1.2.
CJ101.1.1 Electrical energy storage system (ESS) capacity.
Each building shall have one or more ESS with a total rated energy capacity and rated power capacity as follows:
1. ESS-rated energy capacity (kWh) ≥ 1.0 × installed on-site renewable electric energy system rated power (kWDC).
2.
ESS-rated power capacity (kW) ≥ 0.25 × installed on-site renewable electric energy system rated power (kWDC).
Where installed, DC-coupled battery systems shall meet the requirements for rated energy capacity alone.
CJ101.1.2 Electrical energy storage system (ESS) ready.
Each building shall have one or more reserved ESS-ready areas to accommodate future electrical storage in accordance with Sections CJ101.1.2.1 through CJ101.1.2.4.
CJ101.1.2.1 ESS-ready location.
Each ESS-ready area shall be located in accordance with Section 1207 of the International Fire Code.
CJ101.1.2.2 ESS-ready minimum area requirements.
Each ESS-ready area shall be sized in accordance with the spacing requirements of Section 1207 of the International Fire Code and the UL 9540 or UL 9540A designated rating of the planned system. Where rated to UL 9540A, the area shall be sized in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
CJ101.1.2.3 Electrical distribution equipment.
The on-site electrical distribution equipment shall have sufficient capacity, rating and space to allow the installation of overcurrent devices and circuit wiring in accordance with NFPA 70 for future electrical ESS complying with the capacity criteria of Section CJ101.1.2.4.
CJ101.1.2.4 ESS-ready minimum system capacity.
Compliance with ESS-ready requirements in Sections CJ101.1.2.1 through
CJ101.1.2.3 shall be based on a minimum total energy capacity and minimum rated power capacity as follows:
1. ESS-rated energy capacity (kWh) ≥ gross conditioned floor area of the three largest floors (ft2) × 0.0008 kWh/ft2.
2. ESS-rated power capacity (kW) ≥ gross conditioned floor area of the three largest floors (ft2) × 0.0002 kW/ft2.
Section CJ102 Referenced Standards
CJ102.1 General.
See Table CJ102.1 for standards that are referenced in various sections of this appendix. Standards are listed by the standard identification with the effective date, standard title, and the section or sections of this appendix that reference the standard.
