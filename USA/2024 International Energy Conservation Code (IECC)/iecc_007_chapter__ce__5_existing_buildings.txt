For SI: °C = (°F – 32)/1.8, 1 British thermal unit per hour = 0.2931 W, db = dry bulb temperature, wb = wet bulb temperature. “Cap” = The rated cooling capacity of the project in Btu/h. Where the unit’s capacity is less than 7,000 Btu/h, use 7,000 Btu/h in the calculation. Where the unit’s capacity is greater than 15,000 Btu/h, use 15,000 Btu/h in the calculations.
a. Chapter 6 contains a complete specification of the referenced standards, which include test procedures, including the reference year version of the test procedure.
b. Nonstandard size units must be factory labeled as follows: “MANUFACTURED FOR NONSTANDARD SIZE APPLICATIONS ONLY; NOT TO BE INSTALLED IN NEW STANDARD PROJECTS.” Nonstandard size efficiencies apply only to units being installed in existing sleeves having an external wall opening of less than 16 inches high or less than 42 inches wide and having a cross-sectional area less than 670 square inches.
c. The cooling-mode wet bulb temperature requirement only applies for units that reject condensate to the condenser coil.
d. Room air conditioners are regulated as consumer products by 10 CFR 430. For US applications of room air conditioners, refer to Informative Appendix F, Table F-3, for the US DOE minimum efficiency requirements for US applications.
e. “Cap” in EER and COPH equations for PTACs and PTHPs means cooling capacity in Btu/h at 95°F outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

a. For purposes of this table, open-circuit cooling tower performance is defined as the water-flow rating of the tower at the thermal rating condition listed in the table divided by the fan motor nameplate power.
b. For purposes of this table, closed-circuit cooling tower performance is defined as the process water-flow rating of the tower at the thermal rating condition listed in the table divided by the sum of the fan motor nameplate power and the integral spray pump motor nameplate power.
c. For purposes of this table, dry-cooler performance is defined as the process water-flow rating of the unit at the thermal rating condition listed in the table divided by the total fan motor nameplate power of the unit, and air-cooled condenser performance is defined as the heat rejected from the refrigerant divided by the total fan motor nameplate power of the unit.
d.
ASHRAE 90.1 Section 13 contains a complete specification of the referenced test procedure, including the referenced year version of the test procedure.
e. The efficiencies and test procedures for both open- and closed-circuit cooling towers are not applicable to hybrid cooling towers that contain a combination of separate wet and dry heat exchange sections. The certification requirements do not apply to field-erected cooling towers.
f. All cooling towers shall comply with the minimum efficiency listed in the table for that specific type of tower with the capacity effect of any project-specific accessories and/or options included in the capacity of the cooling tower.

C406.1.1.1 Reserved.
C406.1.1.2 Building core/shell and build-out construction.
Where separate permits are issued for core and shell buildings and build-out construction, compliance shall be in accordance with the following requirements.
1. Core and shell buildings or portions of buildings shall comply with one of the following:
1.1. Where the permit includes a central HVAC system or service water heating system with chillers, heat pumps, boilers, service water heating equipment or loop pumping systems with heat rejection, the project shall achieve not less than 50 percent of the energy credits required by Section C406.1.1 in accordance with Section C406.2.
1.2. Alternatively, the project shall achieve not less than 33 percent of the energy credits required by Section C406.1.1.
2. For core and shell buildings or portions of buildings, the energy credits achieved shall be subject to the following adjustments:
2.1. Lighting measure credits shall be determined only for areas with final lighting installed.
2.2. Where HVAC or service water heating systems are designed to serve the entire building, full HVAC or service water heating measure credits shall be achieved.
2.3. Where HVAC or service water heating systems are designed to serve individual areas, HVAC or service water heating measure credits achieved shall be reduced in proportion to the floor area with final HVAC systems or final service water heating systems installed.
3. Build-out construction shall be deemed to comply with Section C406.1 where one of the following applies:
3.1. Where heating and cooling generation is provided by a previously installed central system, the energy credits achieved in accordance with Section C406.2 under the build-out project are not less than 33 percent of the credits required by Section C406.1.1.
3.2. Where heating and cooling generation is provided by an HVAC system installed in the build-out, the energy credits achieved in accordance with Section C406.2 under the build-out project are not less than 50 percent of the credits required by Section C406.1.1.
3.3. Where the core and shell
building is
approved in accordance with Section C407 under the 2021 IECC or later.
C406.1.2 Additional renewable and load management credit requirements.
Buildings shall comply with measures from Section C406.3 to achieve not less than the number of required renewable and load management credits from Table C406.1.2 based on building occupancy group and climate zone. Where a project contains multiple occupancies, credits in Table C406.1.2 from each building occupancy shall be weighted by the gross floor area to determine the weighted-average project energy credits required. Accessory occupancies shall be included with the primary occupancy group for the purposes of Section C406.
Exception:
Where a building achieves more energy efficiency credits in Section C406.2 than are required in Section C406.1.1, the renewable and load management credits required in Table C406.1.2 shall be permitted to be reduced by the amount of surplus energy efficiency credits.

C406.2 Additional energy efficiency credits achieved.
Each energy efficiency credit measure used to meet credit requirements for the project shall have efficiency that is greater than the requirements in Sections C402 through C405. Measures installed in the project that meet the requirements in Sections C406.2.1 through C406.2.6 shall achieve the base credits listed for the measure and occupancy type in Tables C406.2(1) through C406.2(9) or, where calculations required by Sections C406.2.1 through C406.2.6 create or modify the table credits, the credits achieved shall be based on the calculations.
Energy credits achieved for measures shall be determined by one of the following, as applicable:
1. The measure’s energy credit shall be the base energy credit from Tables C406.2(1) through C406.2(9) for the measure where no adjustment factor or calculation is included in the description of the measure in Section C406.2.
2. The measure’s energy credit shall be the base energy credit for the measure adjusted by a factor or equation as stated in the description of the measure in Section C406.2. Where adjustments are applied, each measure’s energy credit shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
3. The measure’s energy credit shall be calculated as stated in the measure’s description in Section C406.2, where each individual measure credit shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
Energy credits achieved for the project shall be the sum of the individual measure’s energy credits. Credits are available for the measures listed in this section. Where a project contains multiple building occupancy groups:
1. Credits achieved for each occupancy group shall be summed and then weighted by the conditioned floor area of each occupancy group to determine the weighted average project energy credits achieved.
2. Improved envelope efficiency (E01 through E06), HVAC performance (H01) and lighting reduction (L06) measure credits shall be determined for the building or permitted conditioned floor area as a whole. Credits for other measures shall be determined for each occupancy separately. Credits shall be taken from applicable tables or calculations for each occupancy and weighted by the building occupancy group floor area.

ANSI/CTA-2045-A or
ANSI/CTA-2045-B.
3.4. For air conditioners and heat pumps with two or more stages of control and cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h (19 kW), thermostats with a demand responsive control that complies with the communication and performance requirements of AHRI 1380.
3.5. A device that complies with IEC 62746-10-1, an international standard for the open automated demand response system interface between the appliance, system, or energy management system and the controlling entity.
3.6. An interface that complies with the communication protocol required by a controlling entity to participate in an automated demand response program.
3.7. Where the controlling entity does not have a demand response signal available for the building type and size, local load management control shall be provided based on either:
3.7.1. Building demand management controls that monitor building electrical demand and initiate controls to minimize monthly or peak time period demand charges.
3.7.2. A local building schedule that reflects the electric rate peak period dates and times where buildings are less than 25,000 gross square feet (2322 m2).
In this case, a binary input to the control system shall be provided that activates the demand response sequence.
