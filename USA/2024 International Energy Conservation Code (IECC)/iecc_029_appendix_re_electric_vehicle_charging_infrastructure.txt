The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
This voluntary appendix provides requirements for electric energy storage readiness provisions.
Section RD101 Scope
RD101.1 General.
These provisions shall be applicable for new construction where solar-ready measures or an on-site solar PV system is required.
Section RD102 General Definition
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM (ESS). One or more devices, assembled together, capable of storing energy in order to supply electrical energy at a future time.
Section RD103 Electrical Energy Storage
RD103.1 Electrical energy storage.
One- and two-family
dwellings, townhouse units and Group R-3 occupancies shall comply with either Section RD103.2 or RD103.3. Buildings with Group R-2 and R-4 occupancies shall comply with Section RD103.4.
RD103.2 Electrical energy storage energy capacity.
Each building shall have an ESS with a rated energy capacity of not less than 5 kWh with not fewer than four
ESS-supplied branch circuits.
RD103.3 Electrical energy storage system readiness.
Each building shall be energy-storage ready in accordance with Sections RD103.3.1 through RD103.3.4.
RD103.3.1 Energy storage system space.
Interior or exterior space with dimensions and locations in accordance with Section R330 of the International Residential Code and Section 110.26 of NFPA 70 shall be reserved to allow for the future installation of an
ESS.
RD103.3.2 System isolation equipment space.
Space shall be reserved to allow for the future installation of a transfer switch within 3 feet (305 mm) of the main panelboard. Raceways shall be installed between the panelboard and the transfer switch location to allow the connection of an ESS.
RD103.3.3 Panelboard with backed-up load circuits.
A dedicated raceway shall be provided from the main service to a panelboard that supplies the branch circuits served by the ESS. All branch circuits are permitted to be supplied by the main service panel prior to the installation of an ESS. The trade size of the raceway shall be not less than 1 inch (25 mm). The panelboard that supplies the branch circuits shall be labeled, “Subpanel reserved for future battery energy storage system to supply essential loads.”
RD103.3.4 Branch circuits served by the ESS.
Not fewer than four branch circuits shall be identified and have their source of supply collocated at a single panelboard supplied by the
ESS. The following end uses shall be served by the branch circuits:
1. A refrigerator.
2. One lighting circuit near the primary egress.
3. A sleeping room receptacle outlet.
RD103.4 Electrical energy storage system.
Buildings with Group R-2 and R-4 occupancies shall comply with Appendix CJ.
