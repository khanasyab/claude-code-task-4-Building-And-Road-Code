Appendix RE Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
This appendix ​provides requirements for electric vehicle charging infrastructure for adopting jurisdictions.
Section RE101 Electric Vehicle Power Transfer
RE101.1 Definitions.
AUTOMOBILE PARKING SPACE.
A space within a building or private or public parking lot, exclusive of driveways, ramps, columns, office and work areas, for the parking of an automobile.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV).
An automotive-type vehicle for on-road use, such as passenger automobiles, buses, trucks, vans, neighborhood electric vehicles and electric motorcycles, primarily powered by an electric motor that draws current from a building electrical service, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), a rechargeable storage battery, a fuel cell, a photovoltaic array or another source of electric current.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CAPABLE SPACE (EV CAPABLE SPACE). A designated automobile parking space that is provided with electrical infrastructure such as, but not limited to, raceways, cables, electrical capacity, a panelboard or other electrical distribution equipment space necessary for the future installation of an EVSE.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE READY SPACE (EV READY SPACE). An automobile parking space that is provided with a branch circuit and an outlet, junction box or receptacle that will support an installed
EVSE.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT (EVSE).
Equipment for plug-in power transfer, including ungrounded, grounded and equipment grounding conductors; electric vehicle connectors; attached plugs; any personal protection system; and all other fittings, devices, power outlets or apparatus installed specifically for the purpose of transferring energy between the premises wiring and the electric vehicle.
ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED SPACE (EVSE SPACE).
An automobile parking space that is provided with a dedicated EVSE connection.
RE101.2 Electric vehicle power transfer infrastructure.
​New residential automobile parking spaces for residential
buildings shall be provided with electric vehicle power
transfer infrastructure in accordance with Sections RE101.2.1
through RE101.2.5.​
RE101.2.1 Quantity.
New one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses with a designated attached or detached garage or other on-site private parking provided adjacent to the dwelling unit shall be provided with one EV capable, EV ready or EVSE space per dwelling unit. R-2 occupancies or allocated parking for R-2 occupancies in mixed-use
buildings
shall be provided with an EV capable space, EV ready space or EVSE space for 40 percent of the dwelling units or automobile parking spaces, whichever is less.
Exceptions:
1. Where the local electric distribution entity certifies in writing that it is not able to provide 100 percent of the necessary distribution capacity within 2 years after the estimated certificate of occupancy date, the required EV charging infrastructure shall be reduced based on the available existing electric distribution capacity.
2. ​Where substantiation is approved that meeting the requirements of
Section RE101.2.5
will alter the local utility infrastructure design requirements on the utility side of the meter so as to increase the utility side cost to the builder or developer by more than $450 per dwelling unit.​
RE101.2.2 EV capable spaces.
​Each EV capable space used to meet the requirements of Section RE101.2.1
shall comply with all of the following:
1. A continuous raceway or cable assembly shall be installed between a suitable panelboard or other on-site electrical distribution equipment and an enclosure or outlet located within 6 feet (1828 mm) of the EV capable space.
2. ​The installed raceway or cable assembly shall be sized and rated to supply a minimum circuit capacity in accordance with Section RE101.2.5.​ 3. The electrical distribution equipment to which the raceway or cable assembly connects shall have sufficient dedicated space and spare electrical capacity for a two-pole circuit breaker or set of fuses.
4. The electrical enclosure or outlet and the electrical distribution equipment directory shall be marked: “For future electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).”
RE101.2.3 EV ready spaces.
Each branch circuit serving EV ready spaces shall comply with all of the following:
1. Termination at an outlet or enclosure, located within 6 feet (1828 mm) of each EV ready space it serves and marked “For electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).”
2. ​Service by an electrical distribution system and circuit capacity in accordance with
Section RE101.2.5.​ 3. Designation on the panelboard or other electrical distribution equipment directory as “For electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).”
RE101.2.4 EVSE spaces.
An installed EVSE with multiple output connections shall be permitted to serve multiple EVSE spaces. Each
EVSE serving either a single EVSE space or multiple EVSE spaces shall comply with the following:
1. ​Be served by an electrical distribution system in accordance with Section RE101.2.5.​ 2. ​Have a nameplate charging capacity of not less than 6.2 kVA (or 30A at 208/240V) per EVSE
space served. Where an EVSE serves three or more
EVSE
spaces and is controlled by an energy management system in accordance with Section RE101.2.5, the nameplate charging capacity shall be not less than 2.1 kVA per
EVSE
space served.​
3. Be located within 6 feet (1828 mm) of each EVSE
space it serves.
4. ​Be installed in accordance with NFPA 70
and be listed and
labeled in accordance with UL 2202 or UL 2594.​
RE101.2.5 Electrical distribution system capacity.
​The branch circuits and electrical distribution system serving each EV capable space, EV ready space and EVSE space used to comply with Section RE101.2.1 shall comply with one of the following: ​ 1. ​Sized for a calculated EV charging load of not less than 6.2 kVA per EVSE, EV ready
or EV capable space. Where a circuit is shared or managed, it shall be in accordance with
NFPA 70.​ 2. ​The capacity of the electrical distribution system and each branch circuit serving multiple EVSE
spaces, EV ready spaces or EV capable spaces
designed to be controlled by an energy management system in accordance with NFPA 70 shall be sized for a calculated
EV charging load of not less than 2.1 kVA per space. Where an energy management system is used to control EV charging loads for the purposes of this section, it shall not be configured to turn off electrical power to
EVSE or EV ready spaces used to comply with Section RE101.2.1.​
Section RE102 Referenced Standards
RE102.1 General.
​See Table RE102.1 for standards that are referenced in various sections of this appendix. Standards are listed by the standard identification with the effective date, standard title, and the section or sections of this appendix that reference the standard.​
