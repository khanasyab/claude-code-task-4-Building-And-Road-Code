Appendix CI Demand Responsive Controls
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
Appendix CI can by adopted by authorities having jurisdiction seeking demand responsive controls to be integrated into heating and cooling systems, water heating systems and lighting systems.
Section CI101 Demand Responsive Heating and Cooling Systems
CI101.1 Demand responsive controls.
Electric heating and cooling systems shall be provided with demand responsive controls capable of executing the following actions in response to a demand response signal:
1. Automatically increasing the zone operating cooling setpoint by the following values: 1°F (0.5°C), 2°F (1°C), 3°F (1.5°C) and 4°F (2°C).
2. Automatically decreasing the zone operating heating setpoint by the following values: 1°F (0.5°C), 2°F (1°C), 3°F (1.5°C) and 4°F (2°C).
Where a demand response signal is not available, the heating and cooling system controls shall be capable of performing all other functions. Where thermostats are controlled by direct digital control including, but not limited to, an energy management system, the system shall be capable of demand responsive control and capable of adjusting all thermal setpoints to comply. The demand responsive controls shall comply with either Section CI101.1.1 or CI101.1.2.
Exceptions:
1. Group I occupancies.
2. Group H occupancies.
3. Controls serving data center systems.
4. Occupancies or applications requiring precision in indoor temperature control as approved by the code official.
5. Buildings that comply with Load Management measure G02 in Section C406.3.3.
6. Buildings with energy storage capacity for not less than a 25 percent load reduction at peak load for a period of not less than 3 hours.
CI101.1.1 Air conditioners and heat pumps with two or more stages of control and cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h.
Thermostats for air conditioners and heat pumps with two or more stages of control and a cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h (19 kW) shall be provided with a demand responsive control that complies with the communication and performance requirements of AHRI 1380.
CI101.1.2 All other heating and cooling systems.
Thermostats for heating and cooling systems shall be provided with a demand responsive control that complies with one of the following:
1. Certified OpenADR 2.0a VEN, as specified under Clause 11, Conformance.
2. Certified OpenADR 2.0b VEN, as specified under Clause 11, Conformance.
3. Certified by the manufacturer as being capable of responding to a demand response signal from a certified OpenADR 2.0b VEN by automatically implementing the control functions requested by the VEN for the equipment it controls.
4. IEC 62746-10-1.
5. The communication protocol required by a controlling entity, such as a utility or service provider, to participate in an automated demand response program.
6. The physical configuration and communication protocol of ANSI/CTA 2045-A or ANSI/CTA 2045-B.
Section CI102 Demand Responsive Water Heating
CI102.1 Demand responsive water heating.
Electric storage water heaters with a rated water storage volume of 40 gallons (151 L) to 120 gallons (454 L) and a nameplate input rating equal to or less than 12 kW shall be provided with demand responsive controls in accordance with Table CI102.1.
Exceptions:
1. Water heaters that provide a hot water delivery temperature of 180°F (82°C) or greater.
2. Water heaters that comply with Section IV, Part HLW or Section X of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.
3. Water heaters that use three-phase electric power.

Section CI103 Demand Responsive Lighting Controls
CI103.1 Demand responsive lighting controls.
Interior general lighting in Group B, E, M and S occupancies shall have demand responsive controls complying with Section C405.2.8.1 in not less than 75 percent of the interior floor area.
Exceptions:
1. Where the combined interior floor area of Group B, E, M and S occupancies is less than 10,000 square feet (929 m2).
2. Buildings where a demand response signal is not available from a controlling entity other than the owner.
3. Parking garages.
4. Ambulatory care facilities.
5. Outpatient clinics.
6. Physician or dental offices.
