Chapter [RE] 1 Scope and Administration
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of this code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections R101 and
R102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections R103– R110). Section R101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section R102.4). This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document, and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner.

R101.3 Intent.
INSIGHTS
The IECC—Residential Provisions provide market-driven, enforceable requirements for the design and construction of residential buildings, providing minimum efficiency requirements for buildings that result in the maximum level of energy efficiency that is safe, technologically feasible, and life cycle cost-effective, considering economic feasibility, including potential costs and savings for consumers and building owners, and return on investment. Additionally, the code provides jurisdictions with optional supplemental requirements, including requirements that lead to achievement of zero energy buildings, presently, and, through glidepaths that achieve zero energy buildings by 2030 and on additional timelines sought by governments, and achievement of additional policy goals as identified by the Energy and Carbon Advisory Council and approved by the Board of Directors. The code may include nonmandatory appendices incorporating additional energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction resources developed by the International Code Council and others. Requirements contained in the code will include, but not be limited to, prescriptive- and performance-based pathways. The code will aim to simplify code requirements to facilitate the code’s use and compliance rate. The code is updated on a 3-year cycle with each subsequent edition providing increased energy savings over the prior edition. The IECC residential provisions shall include an update to Chapter 11 of the International Residential Code. This code is intended to provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve this intent. This code is not intended to abridge safety, health or environmental requirements contained in other applicable codes or ordinances.
