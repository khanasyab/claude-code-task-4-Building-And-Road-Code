Appendix CC Zero Energy Commercial Building Provisions
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix CC provides a model for applying new renewable energy generation when new buildings add electric load to the grid. This renewable energy will avoid the additional emissions that would otherwise occur from conventional power generation.
Section CC101 General
CC101.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this appendix is to supplement the International Energy Conservation Code and require renewable energy systems of adequate capacity to achieve net zero operational energy.
CC101.2 Scope.
This appendix applies to new buildings that are addressed by the International Energy Conservation Code.Exceptions:
1. Detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses as well as Group R-2 buildings three stories or less in height above grade plane, manufactured homes (mobile dwellings), and manufactured houses (modular dwellings).2. Buildings that use neither electricity nor fossil fuel.
Section CC102 Definitions
CC102.1 Definitions.
The definitions contained in this section supplement or modify the definitions in the
International Energy Conservation Code.ADJUSTED OFF-SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY.The amount of energy production from off-site renewable energy systems that may be used to offset building energy. BUILDING ENERGY.All energy consumed at the building site as measured at the site boundary. Contributions from on-site or off-site renewable energy systems shall not be considered when determining the building energy.
DIRECT ACCESS TO WHOLESALE MARKET. An agreement by the owner and a renewable energy developer to purchase renewable energy from the wholesale market.
DIRECT OWNERSHIP. An off-site renewable energy system under the ownership or control of the building project owner.
GREEN RETAIL PRICING. A program by the retail electricity provider to provide 100 percent renewable energy to the building project owner.
MINIMUM RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENT. The minimum amount of on-site or adjusted off-site renewable energy needed to comply with this appendix.
OFF-SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM.A renewable energy system that serves the building project and is not an on-site renewable energy system, including contracted purchases of renewable energy and renewable energy certificates (RECs). ON-SITE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM.Renewable energy systems located on any of the following:
1.
The building.
2.
The property on which the building is located.
3.
A property that shares a boundary with and is under the same ownership or control as the property on which the building is located.
4.
A property that is under the same ownership or control as the property on which the building is located and is separated only by a public right-of-way from the building served by the renewable energy system.
RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT FUND (REIF). A fund established by a jurisdiction to accept payment from building project owners to construct or acquire interests in qualifying renewable energy systems, together with their associated RECS, on the building project owner’s behalf.
RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM.Photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal energy extracted from hot fluid or steam, wind, or other approved systems used to generate renewable energy. SEMIHEATED SPACE.An enclosed space within a building that is heated by a heating system whose output capacity is greater than or equal to 3.4 Btu/h × ft2of floor area but is not a conditioned space.
Section CC103 Minimum Renewable Energy
CC103.1 Renewable energy.
On-site renewable energy systems shall be installed, or adjusted off-site renewable energy shall be procured to meet the minimum renewable energy requirement in accordance with Equation CC-1. Equation CC-1REon-site+REoff-site≥REmin where:RE on-site =
Annual site energy production from on-site renewable energy systems, including installed onsite renewable energy systems used for compliance with Sections C405.13.1 and C406.RE off-site =
Adjusted annual site energy production from off-site renewable energy systems that is permitted to be credited against the minimum renewable energy requirement. This includes off-site renewable energy purchased for compliance with Section C405.13.2.RE min =
Minimum renewable energy requirement.
When Section C401.2.1 is used for compliance with the International Energy Conservation Code , the minimum renewable energy requirement shall be determined by multiplying the gross conditioned floor area plus the gross semiheated floor area of the proposed building by the prescriptive renewable energy requirement from Table CC103.1. An area-weighted average shall be used for mixed-use buildings. When Section C401.2.1, Item 2 or Section C401.2.2 is used for compliance with the International Energy Conservation Code, the minimum renewable energy requirement shall be equal to the building energy as determined from energy simulations.
