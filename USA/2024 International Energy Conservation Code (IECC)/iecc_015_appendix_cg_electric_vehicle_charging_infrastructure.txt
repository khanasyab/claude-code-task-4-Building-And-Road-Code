Appendix CF Energy Credits
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
Appendix CF can be adopted by authorities having jurisdiction seeking stretch codes building on the methodology of Section C406.
Section CF101 General
CF101.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this appendix is to supplement the International Energy Conservation Code and requires projects to comply with Advanced Energy Credit Package requirements.
CF101.2 Scope.
This appendix applies to all buildings that, in accordance with Section C406.1, are required to comply with Section C406.1.1 or C406.1.2.
Section CF102 Advanced Energy Credit Package
CF102.1 Advanced energy credit package requirements.
The requirements of this section supersede the requirements of Section C406.1.1. Projects shall comply with measures from Section C406.2 to achieve the minimum number of required efficiency credits from Table CF102.1(1) based on building occupancy group and climate zone. Projects with multiple occupancies, unconditioned parking garages and buildings with separate shell-and-core and build-out construction permits shall comply as follows: Where a project contains multiple occupancies, credits in Table CF102.1(1) from each building occupancy shall be weighted by the gross floor area to determine the weighted average project energy credits required. Accessory occupancies shall be included with the primary occupancy group for purposes of Section C406 and this appendix.
Exceptions:
1. Unconditioned parking garages that achieve 50 percent of the credits required for use in Groups S-1 and S-2 in Table CF102.1(1).
2. Portions of buildings devoted to manufacturing or industrial use.
3. Where a building achieves more renewable and load management credits in Section C406.3 than are required in Section C406.1.2, surplus credits shall be permitted to reduce required energy efficiency credits as follows: EECred=EECtbl-{the lesser of:[SRLMlim,SLRMadj×(RLMach-RLMreq)]} where:
EECred =
Reduced required energy efficiency credits.
EECtbl =
Required energy efficiency credits from Table C406.1.1(1).
SRLMlim =
Surplus renewable and load management credit limit from Table C406.1.1(2).
SRLMadj =
1.0 for all-electric or all-renewable buildings (excluding emergency generation); 0.7 for buildings with fossil fuel equipment (excluding emergency generation).
RLMach =
Achieved renewable and load management credits from Section C406.3.
RLMreq =
Required renewable and load management credits from Section C406.1.2.
