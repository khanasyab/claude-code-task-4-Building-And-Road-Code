User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 4 presents the paths and options for compliance with the energy efficiency provisions. Chapter 4 contains energy efficiency provisions for the building envelope, mechanical and water heating systems, lighting and additional efficiency requirements. A performance alternative, energy rating alternative, and tropical regional alternative are also provided to allow for energy code compliance other than by the prescriptive method.

NR = Not Required, ci = Continuous Insulation.
a. R-values are minimums. U-factors and SHGC are maximums. Where insulation is installed in a cavity that is less than the label or design thickness of the insulation, the installed R-value of the insulation shall be not less than the R-value specified in the table.
b. “5ci or 13” means R-5 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior side of the wall. "10ci or 13" means R-10 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior side of the wall. "15ci or 19 or 13&5ci" means R-15 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall; or R-19 cavity insulation on the interior side of the wall; or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior of the wall in addition to R-5 continuous insulation on the interior or exterior surface of the wall.
c. Slab insulation shall be installed in accordance with Section R402.2.10.1.
d. Basement wall insulation is not required in Warm Humid locations as defined by Figure R301.1 and Table R301.1.
e. The first value is cavity insulation; the second value is continuous insulation. Therefore, as an example, “13&5” means R-13 cavity insulation plus R-5 continuous insulation.
f. Mass walls shall be in accordance with Section R402.2.6. The second R-value applies where more than half of the insulation is on the interior of the mass wall.
g. A maximum U-factor of 0.30 shall apply in Marine Climate Zone 4 and Climate Zones 5 through 8 to vertical fenestration products installed in buildings located either:

R402.1.4 R-value computation.
Cavity insulation alone shall be used to determine compliance with the cavity insulation
R-value requirements in Table R402.1.3. Where cavity insulation is installed in multiple layers, the
R-values of the cavity insulation layers shall be summed to determine compliance with the cavity insulationR-value requirements. The manufacturer’s settled R-value shall be used for blown-in insulation. Continuous insulation (ci) alone shall be used to determine compliance with the continuous insulation R-value requirements in Table R402.1.3. Where continuous insulation is installed in multiple layers, the R-values of the continuous insulation layers shall be summed to determine compliance with the continuous insulation
R-value requirements. Cavity insulation
R-values shall not be used to determine compliance with the continuous insulation
R-value requirements in Table R402.1.3. Computed R-values shall not include an R-value for other building materials or air films.
