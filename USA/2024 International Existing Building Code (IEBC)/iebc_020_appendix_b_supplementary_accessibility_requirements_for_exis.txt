Chapter A4Earthquake Risk Reduction in Wood-Frame Residential Buildings with Soft, Weak or Open Font WallsSection A401 General
[BS] A401.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public welfare and safety by reducing the risk of death or injury as a result of the effects of earthquakes on existing wood-frame, multiple-unit residential buildings. The ground motions of past earthquakes have caused the loss of human life, personal injury and property damage in these types of buildings. This chapter creates minimum standards to strengthen the more vulnerable portions of these structures. Where fully followed, these minimum standards will improve the performance of these buildings but will not necessarily prevent all earthquake-related damage.
[BS] A401.2 Scope.
The provisions of this chapter apply to existing buildings of wood construction that contain residential occupancies and are assigned to Risk Category II, and where the structure has a soft, weak or open-front wall line, and there exists one or more stories above.
Section A402 Definitions
[BS] A402.1 Definitions.
Notwithstanding the applicable definitions, symbols and notations in the building code, the following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this chapter:[BS]ASPECT RATIO.The span-width ratio for horizontal diaphragms and the height-length ratio for shear walls.[BS]NONCONFORMING STRUCTURAL MATERIALS.Wall bracing materials other than wood structural panels or diagonal sheathing.[BS]OPEN-FRONT WALL LINE.An exterior wall line, without vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, that requires tributary seismic forces to be resisted by diaphragm rotation or excessive cantilever beyond parallel lines of shear walls. Diaphragms that cantilever more than 25 percent of the distance between lines of lateral force-resisting elements from which the diaphragm cantilevers shall be considered to be excessive. Exterior exit balconies of 6 feet (1829 mm) or less in width shall not be considered excessive cantilevers.[BS]RETROFIT.An improvement of the lateral force-resisting system by alteration of existing structural elements or addition of new structural elements.[BS]SOFT WALL LINE.A wall line whose lateral stiffness is less than that required by story drift limitations or deformation compatibility requirements of this chapter. In lieu of analysis, a soft wall line may be defined as a wall line in a story where the story stiffness is less than 70 percent of the story above for the direction under consideration.[BS]STORY.A story as defined by the building code, including any basement or underfloor space of a building with cripple walls exceeding 4 feet (1219 mm) in height.[BS]WALL LINE.Any length of wall along a principal axis of the building used to provide resistance to lateral loads. Parallel wall lines separated by less than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall be considered to be one wall line for the distribution of loads.[BS]WEAK WALL LINE.A wall line in a story where the story strength is less than 80 percent of the story above in the direction under consideration.

Buildings for which the prescriptive measures provided in Section A404 apply and are used.Alteration of the existing lateral force-resisting system or vertical load-carrying system shall not reduce the strength or stiffness of the existing structure, unless the altered structure would remain in conformance to the building code and this chapter.
[BS] A403.2 Scope of analysis.
This chapter requires the alteration, repair, replacement or addition of structural elements and their connections to meet the strength and stiffness requirements herein. The lateral load-path analysis shall include the resisting elements and connections from the wood diaphragm immediately above any soft, weak or open-front wall lines to the foundation soil interface or to the uppermost story of a podium structure comprised of steel, masonry, or concrete structural systems that supports the upper wood-framed structure. Stories above the uppermost story with a soft, weak or open-front wall line shall be considered in the analysis but need not be modified. The lateral load-path analysis for added structural elements shall include evaluation of the allowable soil-bearing and lateral pressures in accordance with the building code. Where any portion of a building within the scope of this chapter is constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33 percent slope), the lateral force-resisting system at and below the base level diaphragm shall be analyzed for the effects of concentrated lateral forces at the base caused by this hillside condition.
[BS] A403.3 Design base shear and design parameters.
The design base shear in a given direction shall be permitted to be 75 percent of the value required for similar new construction in accordance with the building code. The value of R used in the design of the strengthening of any story shall not exceed the lowest value of R used in the same direction at any story above. The system overstrength factor, Ω0, and the deflection amplification factor, Cd, shall be not less than the largest respective value corresponding to the R factor being used in the direction under consideration.Exceptions: 1.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category B, values of R, Ω0 and Cd shall be permitted to be based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening.2.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C or D, values of R, Ω 0 and Cd shall be permitted to be based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening, provided that when the strengthening is complete, the strengthened structure will not have an extreme weak story irregularity defined as Type 5b in ASCE 7, Table 12.3-2.3.For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category E, values of R, Ω0 and Cd shall be permitted to be based on the seismic force-resisting system being used to achieve the required strengthening, provided that when the strengthening is complete, the strengthened structure will not have an extreme soft story, a weak story, or an extreme weak story irregularity defined, respectively, as Types 1b, 5a and 5b in ASCE 7, Table 12.3-2.4.For retrofit systems involving different seismic force-resisting systems in the same direction within the same story, resisting elements are permitted to be designed using the least value of R for the different structural systems found in each independent line of resistance if all of the following conditions are met:4.1.The building is assigned to Risk Category I or II.4.2.The building height is no more than four stories above grade plane.4.3.The seismic force-resisting systems of the retrofitted building comprise only wood structural panel shear walls, steel moment-resisting frames, steel cantilever columns and steel-braced frames. Values for
