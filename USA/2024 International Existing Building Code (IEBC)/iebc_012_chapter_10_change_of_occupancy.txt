Chapter 9 Alterations—Level 3
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 9 provides the technical requirements for those existing buildings that undergo Level 3 alterations. The purpose of this chapter is to provide detailed requirements and provisions to identify the required improvements in the existing building elements, building spaces and building structural system. This chapter is distinguished from Chapters 7 and 8 by involving alterations that cover 50 percent or more of the aggregate area of the building. In contrast, Level 1 alterations do not involve space reconfiguration, and Level 2 alterations involve extensive space reconfiguration that does not exceed 50 percent of the building area. Depending on the nature of alteration work, its location within the building, and whether it encompasses one or more tenants, improvements and upgrades could be required for the open floor penetrations, sprinkler system or the installation of additional means of egress such as stairs or fire escapes. At times and under certain situations, this chapter also is intended to improve the safety of certain building features beyond the work area and in other parts of the building where no alteration work might be taking place.
