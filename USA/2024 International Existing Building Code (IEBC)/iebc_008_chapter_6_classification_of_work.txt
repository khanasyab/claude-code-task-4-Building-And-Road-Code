Chapter 5 Prescriptive Compliance Method
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 5 provides details for the prescriptive compliance method—one of the three main options of compliance available in this code for buildings and structures undergoing alteration, addition or change of occupancy.
Section 501 General
CDP
501.1 Scope.
CDP
The provisions of this chapter shall control the alteration, addition and change of occupancy of existing buildings and structures, including historic buildings and structures as referenced in Section 301.3.1.
501.1.1 Compliance with other methods.
CDP
Alterations, additions and changes of occupancy to existing buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions of this chapter or with one of the methods provided in Section 301.3.
501.2 Fire-resistance ratings.
Where approved by the code official, in buildings where an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 or 903.3.1.2 of the International Building Code has been added, and the building is now sprinklered throughout, the required fire-resistance ratings of building elements and materials shall be permitted to meet the requirements of the current building code. The building is required to meet the other applicable requirements of the International Building Code.Plans, investigation and evaluation reports, and other data shall be submitted indicating which building elements and materials the applicant is requesting the code official to review and approve for determination of applying the current building code fire-resistance ratings. Any special construction features, including fire-resistance-rated assemblies and smoke-resistive assemblies, conditions of occupancy, means of egress conditions, fire code deficiencies, approved modifications or
approved alternative materials, design and methods of construction, and equipment applying to the building that impact required fire-resistance ratings shall be identified in the evaluation reports submitted.
501.3 Health care facilities.
CDP
In Group I-2 facilities, ambulatory care
facilities and outpatient clinics, any altered or added portion of an existing electrical or medical gas systems shall be required to meet installation and equipment requirements in NFPA 99.
Section 502 Additions
CDP
502.1 General.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Additions to any building or structure shall comply with the requirements of the International Building Code for new construction. alterations to the existing building or structure shall be made to ensure that the existing building or structure together with the addition are not less complying with the provisions of the International Building Code than the existing building or structure was prior to the addition except that the structural elements need only comply with Sections 502.2 through 502.3​. An existing building together with its additions shall comply with the height and area provisions of Chapter 5 of the International Building Code. Where a new occupiable roof is added to a building or structure, the occupiable roof shall comply with the provisions of the International Building Code. Exception:

CDP
INSIGHTS
Where the addition and the existing building have different occupancies, the risk category of each existing and added occupancy shall be determined in accordance with Section 1604.5.1 of the International Building Code. Where application of that section results in a higher risk category for the existing building compared with the risk category for the existing building before the
addition, such a change shall be considered a change of occupancy and shall comply with Section 506 of this code. Where application of that section results in a higher risk category for the addition compared with the risk category for the
addition by itself, the addition and any systems in the existing building required to serve the addition shall comply with the requirements of the International Building Code for new construction for the higher risk category.
INSIGHTS (2)
