Chapter 11 Additions
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 11 provides the requirements for additions, which correlate to the code requirements for new construction. There are, however, some exceptions that are specifically stated within this chapter. An “Addition” is defined in Chapter 2 as “an extension or increase in the floor area, number of stories or height of a building or structure.” Chapter 11 contains the minimum requirements for an addition that is not separated from the existing building by a fire wall.
Section 1101 General
CDP
INSIGHTS
INSIGHTS (3)
1101.1 Scope.
CDP
INSIGHTS
An addition to a building or structure shall comply with the International Codes as adopted for new construction without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with any requirements of those codes or of these provisions, except as required by this chapter. Where an addition impacts the existing building or structure, that portion shall comply with this code. INSIGHTS (2)
1101.2 Creation or extension of nonconformity.
CDP
INSIGHTS
An addition shall not create or extend any nonconformity in the existing building to which the addition is being made with regard to accessibility, structural strength, supports and attachments for nonstructural components, fire safety, means of egress or the capacity of mechanical, plumbing or electrical systems. Exception:
Nonconforming supports and attachments for nonstructural components that serve the addition from within the existing building need not be altered to comply with International Building Code
Section 1613 unless the components are part of the addition’s life safety system or are required to serve an addition assigned to Risk Category IV.
INSIGHTS (2)
[BS] 1101.3 Risk category assignment.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Where the addition and the existing building have different occupancies, the risk category of each existing and added occupancy shall be determined in accordance with Section 1604.5.1 of the International Building Code. Where application of that section results in a higher risk category for the existing building compared with the risk category for the existing building before the addition, such a change shall be considered a change of occupancy and shall comply with Chapter 10 of this code. Where application of that section results in a higher risk category for the addition compared with the risk category for the addition by itself, the addition and any systems in the existing building required to serve the addition shall comply with the requirements of the International Building Code for new construction for the higher risk category.
INSIGHTS (2)
1101.4 Other work.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Any repair or alteration work within an existing building to which an addition is being made shall comply with the applicable requirements for the work as classified in Chapter 6. INSIGHTS (2)
1101.5 Smoke barriers in Group I-1, Condition 2.
INSIGHTS
Where an addition to an existing Group I-1, Condition 2 building adds sleeping areas that result in more than 50 care recipients on a story, smoke barriers shall be provided to subdivide such story into not fewer than two smoke compartments in accordance with Section 420.6 of the International Building Code.
Exception:
Where the existing building is divided into smoke compartments and the
addition does not result in any individual smoke compartment exceeding the size and travel distance requirements in Section 420.6 of the International Building Code, additional smoke barriers are not required.
INSIGHTS (3)
1101.6 Enhanced classroom acoustics.
CDP
In Group E occupancies, enhanced classroom acoustics shall be provided in all classrooms in the addition with a volume of 20,000 cubic feet (565 m3) or less. Enhanced classroom acoustics shall comply with the reverberation time in Section 808 of ICC A117.1.
1101.7 Occupiable roofs.
Where a new occupiable roof is added to a building or structure, the occupiable roof shall comply with the provisions of the International Building Code.
Section 1102 Heights and Areas
INSIGHTS
INSIGHTS (1)
1102.1 Height limitations.
An addition shall not increase the height of an existing building beyond that permitted under the applicable provisions of Chapter 5 of the International Building Code for new buildings.
1102.2 Area limitations.
INSIGHTS
An addition shall not increase the area of an existing building beyond that permitted under the applicable provisions of Chapter 5 of the International Building Code for new buildings unless fire separation as required by the International Building Code is provided.Exception: In-filling of floor openings and nonoccupiable appendages such as elevator and exit stairway shafts shall be permitted beyond that permitted by the International Building Code. INSIGHTS (2)
1102.3 Fire protection systems.
INSIGHTS
Existing fire areas increased by the addition shall comply with Chapter 9 of the International Building Code. Exception:
Nonoccupiable appendages, such as elevator and exit stairway shafts, shall be permitted beyond that permitted by the International Building Code.
INSIGHTS (2)
Section 1103 Structural
CDP
[BS] 1103.1 Additional gravity loads.
CDP
Any existing gravity load-carrying structural element for which an
addition and its related alterations cause an increase in design dead, live or snow load, including snow drift effects, of more than 5 percent shall be replaced or altered as needed to carry the gravity loads required by the International Building Code for new structures. Any existing gravity load-carrying structural element whose gravity load-carrying capacity is decreased as part of the
addition and its related alterations shall be considered to be an altered element subject to the requirements of Section 805.2. Any existing element that will form part of the lateral load path for any part of the addition shall be considered to be an existing lateral load-carrying structural element subject to the requirements of Section 1103.2.Exception: Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling units or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the existing building and the addition together comply with the conventional light-frame construction methods of the International Building Code or the provisions of the International Residential Code.
[BS] 1103.2 Lateral force-resisting system.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Where the addition is structurally independent of the existing structure, existing lateral load-carrying structural elements shall be permitted to remain unaltered. Where the addition is not structurally independent of the existing structure, the lateral force-resisting system of the existing structure and its addition acting together as a single structure shall comply with Section 1609 of the International Building Code and Section 304.3.1 of this code.Exceptions: 1.Buildings of Group R occupancy with not more than five dwelling or sleeping units used solely for residential purposes where the existing building and the addition comply with the conventional light-frame construction methods of the International Building Code or the provisions of the International Residential Code.2.Any existing lateral load-carrying structural element whose demand-capacity ratio with the addition considered is not more than 10 percent greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the addition ignored shall be permitted to remain unaltered. For purposes of calculating demand-capacity ratios, the demand shall consider applicable load combinations with design lateral loads or forces in accordance with Section 1609 of the International Building Code and Section 304.3.1 of this code. For purposes of this exception, comparisons of demand-capacity ratios and calculation of design lateral loads, forces and capacities shall account for the cumulative effects of additions and alterations since original construction.
When calculating demand-capacity ratios for wind, the date of original construction shall be permitted to be taken as the date of completion of a prior addition, alteration or repair in compliance with Section 1609 of the International Building Code or the code wind forces in effect at the time. When calculating demand-capacity ratios for earthquake, the date of original construction shall be permitted to be taken as the date of completion of a prior addition, alteration or repair in compliance with Section 304.3.1 or the full seismic forces in effect at the time.
INSIGHTS (2)
[BS] 1103.3 Flood hazard areas.
CDP
