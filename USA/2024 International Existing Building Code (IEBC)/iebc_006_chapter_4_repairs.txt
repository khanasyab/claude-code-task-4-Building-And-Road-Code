About this chapter:
Chapter 3 explains the three compliance options for alterations and additions available in the code. In addition, this chapter also lays out the methods to be used for seismic design and evaluation throughout this code. Finally, this chapter clarifies that provisions in other I-Codes®related to repairs, alterations, additions, relocation and changes of occupancy must also be addressed unless they conflict with this code. In that case, this code takes precedence.
