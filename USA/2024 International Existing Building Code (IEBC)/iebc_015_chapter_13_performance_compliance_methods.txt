Chapter 12 Historic Buildings
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 12 provides some exceptions from code requirements when the building in question has historic value. The most important criterion for application of this chapter is that the building must be essentially accredited as being of historic significance by a state or local authority after careful review of the historical value of the building. Most, if not all, states have such authorities, as do many local jurisdictions. The agencies with such authority can be located at the state or local government level or through the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Other considerations include the structural condition of the building (i.e., is the building structurally sound), its proposed use, its impact on life safety and how the intent of the code, if not the letter, will be achieved.
Section 1201 General
CDP
1201.1 Scope.
CDP
This chapter is intended to provide means for the preservation of historic buildings. Historic buildings shall comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to their
repair, alteration, relocation and change of occupancy.
[BS] 1201.2 Report.
CDP
INSIGHTS
A historic building undergoing alteration or change of occupancy shall be investigated and evaluated, and a written report shall be prepared and filed with the code official by a registered design professional where required by the code official. The report shall identify all unsafe conditions as defined in Section 115. For buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, a description of the vertical and horizontal elements of the lateral force-resisting system and strengths or weaknesses therein shall be
included. Additionally, the report shall describe the components of the building that provide a level of safety substantially below that required of existing nonhistoric buildings. Exception:
An investigation, evaluation and report shall not be required where the alteration is scoped by Section 602 as a Level 1 alteration and does not make the building or structure less compliant with the provisions of the International Building Code.
INSIGHTS (3)
1201.3 Special occupancy exceptions—museums.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Where a building in Group R-3 is used for Group A, B or M purposes such as museum tours, exhibits and other public assembly activities, or for museums less than 3,000 square feet (279 m2) per floor and a maximum of three stories, the occupancy shall be classified as Group B where life safety conditions are approved by the code official in accordance with Section 1201.2. Adequate means of egress in such buildings, including, but not limited to, a means of maintaining doors in an
unlocked position to permit egress, a limit on building occupancy to an occupant load permitted by the means of egress capacity, a limit on occupancy of certain areas or floors, or supervision by a person knowledgeable in the emergency exiting procedures, shall be provided. INSIGHTS (2)
[BS] 1201.4 Flood hazard areas.
CDP
In flood hazard areas, if all proposed work, including repairs, work required because of a change of occupancy, and alterations, constitutes substantial improvement, then the existing building shall comply with Section 1612 of the International Building Code, or Section R306 of the International Residential Code, as applicable.Exception: If a historic building will continue to be a historic building after the proposed work is completed, then the proposed work is not considered a substantial improvement. For the purposes of this exception, a historic building is any of the following:1.Listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.2.Determined by the Secretary of the US Department of Interior to contribute to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined to qualify as a historic district.3.Designated as historic under a state or local historic preservation program that is approved by the Department of Interior.
1201.5 Unsafe conditions.
CDP
Conditions determined by the code official to be unsafe shall be remedied. Work shall not be required beyond what is required to remedy the unsafe conditions.
Section 1202 Repairs
CDP
1202.1 General.
CDP
Repairs to any portion of a historic building or structure shall be permitted with original or like materials and original methods of construction, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Hazardous materials, such as asbestos and lead-based paint, shall not be used where the code for new construction would not permit their use in buildings of similar occupancy, purpose and location.
1202.2 Replacement.
CDP
Replacement of existing or missing features using original materials shall be permitted. Partial replacement for repairs that match the original in configuration, height and size shall be permitted. Replacement glazing in hazardous locations shall comply with the safety glazing requirements of Chapter 24 of the International Building Code.Exception: Glass block walls, louvered windows and jalousies repaired with like materials.

INSIGHTS
Every historic building that does not conform to the construction requirements specified in this code for the occupancy or use and that constitutes a distinct fire hazard as defined herein shall be provided with an approved automatic sprinkler system as determined appropriate by the code official. However, an automatic
sprinkler system shall not be used to substitute for, or act as an alternative to, the required number of exits from any facility. INSIGHTS (3)
1203.3 Means of egress.
CDP
INSIGHTS
Where, in the opinion of the code official, there is sufficient width and height for a person to pass through the opening or traverse the means of egress, existing door openings and corridor and stairway widths are not required to meet the widths required by the International Building Code or this code.
