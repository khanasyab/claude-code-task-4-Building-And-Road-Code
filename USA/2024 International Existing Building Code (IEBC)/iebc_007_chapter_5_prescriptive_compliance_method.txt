[BS] 405.2.3 Substantial structural damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system.
CDP
A building that has sustained substantial structural damage to the vertical elements of its lateral force-resisting system shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 405.2.3.1, and either repaired in accordance with Section 405.2.3.2 or repaired and retrofitted in accordance with Section 405.2.3.3, depending on the results of the evaluation.Exceptions: 1.Buildings assigned to Seismic Design Category A, B or C whose substantial structural damage was not caused by earthquake need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.2.One- and two-family dwellings need not be evaluated or retrofitted for load combinations that include earthquake effects.
[BS] 405.2.3.1 Evaluation.
INSIGHTS
The building shall be evaluated by a registered design professional, and the evaluation findings shall be submitted to the code official. The evaluation shall establish whether the lateral force-resisting system of the damaged building, including its foundation, if repaired to its predamage state, would comply with the provisions of the International Building Code for load combinations that include wind effects, and with Section 304.3.2 of this code.
