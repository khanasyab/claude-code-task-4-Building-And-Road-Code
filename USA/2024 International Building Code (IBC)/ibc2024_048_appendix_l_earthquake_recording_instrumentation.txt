Appendix L Earthquake Recording Instrumentation
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
The purpose of Appendix L is to foster the collection of ground motion data, particularly from strong-motion earthquakes. When this ground motion data is synthesized, it may be useful in developing future improvements to the earthquake provisions of the code. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

L101.1 General.
INSIGHTS
Every structure located where the 1-second spectral response acceleration, S1, determined in accordance with Chapter 11 of ASCE/SEI 7, is greater than 0.40 and either exceeds six stories in height with an aggregate floor area of 60,000 square feet (5574 m2) or more, or exceeds 10 stories in height regardless of floor area, shall be equipped with not fewer than three approved recording accelerographs. The accelerographs shall be interconnected for common start and common timing. INSIGHTS (2)

As a minimum, instruments shall be located at the lowest level, mid-height, and near the top of the structure. Each instrument shall be located so that access is maintained at all times and is unobstructed by room contents. A sign stating “MAINTAIN CLEAR ACCESS TO THIS INSTRUMENT” in 1-inch (25 mm) block letters shall be posted in a conspicuous location.
L101.3 Maintenance.
Maintenance and service of the instrumentation shall be provided by the owner of the structure. Data produced by the instrument shall be made available to the building official on request.Maintenance and service of the instruments shall be performed annually by an approved testing agency. The owner shall file with the building official a written report from an approved testing agency certifying that each instrument has been serviced and is in proper working condition. This report shall be submitted when the instruments are installed and annually thereafter. Each instrument shall have affixed to it an externally visible tag specifying the date of the last maintenance or service and the printed name and address of the testing agency.
