Chapter 12 Interior Environment
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 12 provides minimum provisions for the interior of buildings—the occupied environment. Ventilation, lighting, and space heating are directly regulated in this chapter and in conjunction with the International Mechanical Code®and the International Energy Conservation Code®. Minimum room size, maximum room-to-room sound transmission and classroom acoustics are set for educational occupancies. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [P] will be considered by a code development committee meting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
