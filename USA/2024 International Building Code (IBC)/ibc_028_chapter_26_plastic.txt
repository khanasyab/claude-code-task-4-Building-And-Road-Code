Chapter 25 Gypsum Panel Products and Plaster
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 25 contains the provisions and referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum panel products and plaster and, in addition, addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These materials are some of the most commonly used interior and exterior finish materials in the building industry. This chapter primarily addresses quality-control-related issues with regard to material specifications and installation requirements. Most products are manufactured in accordance with industry standards. The building official or inspector needs to verify that the appropriate product is used and properly installed for the intended use and location. Proper design and installation of these materials are necessary to provide weather resistance and required fire protection for both structural and nonstructural building components. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
