Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2.
722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side.
Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.

722.5.1.1 General.
INSIGHTS
These procedures establish a basis for determining the fire resistance of column assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant material and, the weight, W, and heated perimeter, D, of structural steel columns. As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel column in pounds per linear foot. The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire- resistive material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(1).
INSIGHTS (2)
722.5.1.1.1 Nonload-bearing protection.
The application of these procedures shall be limited to column assemblies in which the fire-resistant material is not designed to carry any of the load acting on the column.
722.5.1.1.2 Embedments.
In the absence of substantiating fire-endurance test results, ducts, conduit, piping, and similar mechanical, electrical, and plumbing installations shall not be embedded in any required fire-resistant materials.
722.5.1.1.3 Weight-to-perimeter ratio.
