Chapter 4 Special Detailed Requirements Based on Occupancy and Use
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 4 provides detailed criteria for special uses and occupancies. The unique characteristics of a live/work unit as opposed to a 30-story high-rise building call for specific standards for each. Twenty-seven sections address covered and open mall buildings, atriums, hospitals, stages, buildings where hazardous materials are used and stored, jails and prisons, ambulatory care facilities and storm shelters, among other special occupancy issues.
Code Development reminder:
Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F], [BF] or [BE] will be considered by a code development committee meting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
