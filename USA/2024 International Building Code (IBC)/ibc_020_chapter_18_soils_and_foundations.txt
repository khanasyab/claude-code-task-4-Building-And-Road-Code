Chapter 17 Special Inspections and Tests
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing materials and assemblies, and labeling materials and assemblies. Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To determine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle.

Section 1708 In-Situ Load Tests
CDP
1708.1 General.
CDP
Whenever there is a reasonable doubt as to the stability or load-bearing capacity of a completed building, structure or portion thereof for the expected loads, an engineering assessment shall be required. The engineering assessment shall involve either a structural analysis or an in-situ load test, or both. The structural analysis shall be based on actual material properties and other as-built conditions that affect stability or load-bearing capacity, and shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable design standard. The in-situ load tests shall be conducted in accordance with Section 1708.2. If the building, structure or portion thereof is found to have inadequate stability or load-bearing capacity for the expected loads, modifications to ensure structural adequacy or the removal of the inadequate construction shall be required.
1708.2 In-situ load tests.
CDP
In-situ load tests shall be conducted in accordance with Section 1708.2.1 or 1708.2.2 and shall be supervised by a registered design professional. The test shall simulate the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 16 as necessary to address the concerns regarding structural stability of the building, structure or portion thereof.
1708.2.1 Load test procedure specified.
Where a referenced material standard contains an applicable load test procedure and acceptance criteria, the test procedure and acceptance criteria in the standard shall apply. In the absence of specific load factors or acceptance criteria, the load factors and acceptance criteria in Section 1708.2.2 shall apply.
1708.2.2 Load test procedure not specified.
In the absence of applicable load test procedures contained within a material standard referenced by this code or acceptance criteria for a specific material or method of construction, such existing structure shall be subjected to an approved test procedure developed by a registered design professional that simulates applicable loading and deformation conditions. For components that are not a part of the seismic force-resisting system, at a minimum the test load shall be equal to the specified factored design loads. For materials such as wood that have strengths that are dependent on load duration, the test load shall be adjusted to account for the difference in load duration of the test compared to the expected duration of the design loads being considered. For statically loaded components, the test load shall be left in place for a period of 24 hours. For components that carry dynamic loads (for example, machine supports or fall arrest anchors), the load shall be left in place for a period consistent with the component’s actual function. The structure shall be considered to have successfully met the test requirements where the following criteria are satisfied: 1.Under the design load, the deflection shall not exceed the limitations specified in Section 1604.3.2.Within 24 hours after removal of the test load, the structure shall have recovered not less than 75 percent of the maximum deflection.3.During and immediately after the test, the structure shall not show evidence of failure.
Section 1709 Preconstruction Load Tests
1709.1 General.
Where proposed construction is not capable of being designed by approved engineering analysis, or where proposed construction design method does not comply with the applicable material design standard, the system of construction or the structural unit and the connections shall be subjected to the tests prescribed in Section 1709. The building official shall accept certified reports of such tests conducted by an approved testing agency, provided that such tests meet the requirements of this code and approved procedures.
1709.2 Load test procedures specified.
Where specific load test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria are included in the applicable referenced standards, such test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria shall apply. In the absence of specific test procedures, load factors or acceptance criteria, the corresponding provisions in Section 1709.3 shall apply.
1709.3 Load test procedures not specified.
Where load test procedures are not specified in the applicable referenced standards, the load-bearing and deformation capacity of structural components and assemblies shall be determined on the basis of a test procedure developed by a registered design professional that simulates applicable loading and deformation conditions. For components and assemblies that are not a part of the seismic force-resisting system, the test shall be as specified in Section 1709.3.1. Load tests shall simulate the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 16.
1709.3.1 Test procedure.
The test assembly shall be subjected to an increasing superimposed load equal to not less than two times the superimposed design load. The test load shall be left in place for a period of 24 hours. The tested assembly shall be considered to have successfully met the test requirements if the assembly recovers not less than 75 percent of the maximum deflection within 24 hours after the removal of the test load. The test assembly shall then be reloaded and subjected to an increasing superimposed load until either structural failure occurs or the superimposed load is equal to two and one-half times the load at which the deflection limitations specified in Section 1709.3.2 were reached, or the load is equal to two and one-half times the superimposed design load. In the case of structural components and assemblies for which deflection limitations are not specified in Section 1709.3.2, the test specimen shall be subjected to an increasing superimposed load until structural failure occurs or the load is equal to two and one-half times the desired superimposed design load. The allowable superimposed design load shall be taken as the least of: 1.The load at the deflection limitation given in Section 1709.3.2.2.The failure load divided by 2.5.3.The maximum load applied divided by 2.5.
1709.3.2 Deflection.
The deflection of structural members under the design load shall not exceed the limitations in Section 1604.3.
1709.4 Wall and partition assemblies.
Load-bearing wall and partition assemblies shall sustain the test load both with and without window framing. The test load shall include all design load components. Wall and partition assemblies shall be tested both with and without door and window framing.
1709.5 Exterior window and door assemblies.
INSIGHTS
The design pressure rating of exterior windows and doors in buildings shall be determined in accordance with Section 1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2. For exterior windows and doors tested in accordance with Section 1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2, required design wind pressures determined from ASCE/SEI 7 shall be permitted to be converted to allowable stress design by multiplying by 0.6. Exception: Structural wind load design pressures for window or door assemblies other than the size tested in accordance with Section 1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2 shall be permitted to be different than the design value of the tested assembly, provided that such pressures are determined by accepted engineering analysis or validated by an additional test of the window or door assembly to the alternative allowable design pressure in accordance with Section 1709.5.2. Components of the alternate size assembly shall be the same as the tested or labeled assembly.
