Appendix D Fire Districts
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
Appendix D establishes a framework by which a jurisdiction can establish a portion of a jurisdiction as a fire district. Fire districts are often designated in a more densely developed portion of a city where limiting the potential spread of fire is a key consideration. Specific construction types and users are prohibited in a fire district. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to sections in this appendix will be considered by the IBC-General Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

Where the average height of a building is two and one-half stories or more, a block should be considered if the ground area built upon is not less than 40 percent.
D101.2.2 Buffer zone.
Where four contiguous blocks or more comprise a fire district, there shall be a buffer zone of 200 feet (60 960 mm) around the perimeter of such district. Streets, rights-of-way and other open spaces not subject to building construction can be included in the 200 foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone.
D101.2.3 Developed blocks.
Where blocks adjacent to the fire district have developed to the extent that not less than 25 percent of the ground area is built upon and 40 percent or more of the built-on area is devoted to the occupancies specified in Section D101.2.1, they can be considered for inclusion in the fire district, and can form all or a portion of the 200-foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone required in Section D101.2.2.
