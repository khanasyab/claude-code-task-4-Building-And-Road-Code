Appendix N Replicable Buildings
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix:
Appendix N provides jurisdictions with a means of incorporating guidelines for replicable buildings into their building code adoption process. The intent of these provisions is to give jurisdictions a means of streamlining their document review process while verifying code compliance. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to this appendix will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section N101 Administration
CDP
N101.1 Purpose.
CDP
The purpose of this appendix is to provide a format and direction regarding the implementation of a replicable building program.
N101.2 Objectives.
CDP
Such programs allow a jurisdiction to recover from a natural disaster faster and allow for consistent application of the codes for replicable building projects. It will result in faster turnaround for the end user, and a quicker turnaround through the plan review process.
Section N102 Definitions
N102.1 Definitions.
The following words and terms shall, for the purposes of this appendix, have the meanings shown herein.REPLICABLE BUILDING. A building or structure utilizing a replicable design.REPLICABLE DESIGN. A prototypical design developed for application in multiple locations with minimal variation or modification.
Section N103 Replicable Design Requirements
N103.1 Prototypical construction documents.
A replicable design shall establish prototypical construction documents for application at multiple locations. The construction documents shall include details appropriate to each wind region, seismic design category and climate zone for locations in which the replicable design is intended for application. Application of replicable design shall not vary with regard to the following, except for allowable variations in accordance with Section N106:1.Use and occupancy classification.2.Building heights and area limitations.3.Type of construction classification.4.Fire-resistance ratings.5.Interior finishes.6.Fire protection system.7.Means of egress.8.Accessibility.9.Structural design criteria.10.Energy efficiency.11.Type of mechanical and electrical systems.12.Type of plumbing system and number of fixtures.
Section N104 Replicable Design Submittal Requirements
CDP
N104.1 General.
CDP
A summary description of the replicable design and related construction documents shall be submitted to an approved agency. Where approval is requested for elements of the replicable design that is not within the scope of the International Building Code, the construction documents shall specifically designate the codes for which review is sought. Construction documents shall be signed, sealed and dated by a registered design professional.
N104.1.1 Architectural plans and specifications.
Where approval of the architectural requirements of the replicable design is sought, the submittal documents shall include architectural plans and specifications as follows:1.Description of uses and the proposed occupancy groups for all portions of the building.2.Proposed type of construction of the building.3.Fully dimensioned drawings to determine building areas and height.4.Adequate details and dimensions to evaluate means of egress, including occupant loads for each floor, exit arrangement and sizes, corridors, doors and stairs.5.Exit signs and means of egress lighting, including power supply.6.Accessibility scoping provisions.7.Description and details of proposed special occupancies such as a covered mall, high-rise, mezzanine, atrium and public garage.8.Adequate details to evaluate fire-resistance-rated construction requirements, including data substantiating required ratings.9.Details for plastics, insulation and safety glazing installation.10.Details of required fire protection systems.11.Material specifications demonstrating fire-resistance criteria.
N104.1.2 Structural plans, specifications and engineering details.
CDP
Where approval of the structural requirements of the replicable design is sought, the submittal documents shall include details for each wind region, seismic design category and climate zone for which approval is sought; and shall include the following:1.Signed and sealed structural design calculations that support the member sizes on the drawings.2.Design load criteria, including: frost depth, live loads, snow loads, wind loads, earthquake design date and other special loads.3.Details of foundations and superstructure.4.Provisions for special inspection.
N104.1.3 Energy conservation details.
Where approval of the energy conservation requirements of the replicable design is sought, the submittal documents shall include details for each climate zone for which approval is sought; and shall include the following:1.Climate zones for which approval is sought.2.Building envelope details.3.Building mechanical system details.4.Details of electrical power and lighting systems.5.Provisions for system commissioning.
Section N105 Review and Approval of Replicable Design
CDP
N105.1 General.
CDP
Proposed replicable designs shall be reviewed by an approved agency. The review shall be applicable only to the replicable design features submitted in accordance with Section N104. The review shall determine compliance with this code and additional codes specified in Section N104.1.
N105.2 Documentation.
The results of the review shall be documented indicating compliance with the code requirements.
N105.3 Deficiencies.
CDP

N105.4 Approval.
CDP
Where the review of the submitted construction documents determines that the design is in compliance with the codes designated in Section N104.1, and where deficiencies identified in Section N105.3 have been corrected, the approved agency shall issue a summary report of Approved Replicable Design. The summary report shall include any limitations on the approved replicable design including, but not limited to, climate zones, wind regions and seismic design categories.
Section N106 Site-Specific Application of Approved Replicable Design
CDP
N106.1 General.
CDP
Where site-specific application of a replicable design that has been approved under the provisions of Section N105 is sought, the construction documents submitted to the building official shall comply with this section.
N106.2 Submittal documents.
CDP
A summary description of the replicable design and related construction document shall be submitted. Construction documents shall be signed, sealed and dated by the registered design professional. A statement, signed, sealed and dated by the registered design professional, that the replicable design submitted for local review is the same as the replicable design reviewed by the approved agency shall be submitted.
N106.2.1 Architectural plans and specifications.
CDP
Architectural plans and specifications shall include the following:1.Construction documents for variations from the replicable design.2.Construction for portions that are not part of the replicable design.3.Documents for local requirements as identified by the building official.4.Construction documents detailing the foundation system.
Section N107 Site-Specific Review and Approval of Replicable Design
CDP
N107.1 General.
CDP
Proposed site-specific application of replicable design shall be submitted to the building official in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1 and Appendix N.
N107.2 Site-specific review and approval of replicable design.
CDP
The building official shall verify that the replicable design submitted for site-specific application is the same as the approved replicable design reviewed by the approved agency. In addition, the building official shall review the following for code compliance.1.Construction documents for variations from the replicable design.2.Construction for portions of the building that are not part of the replicable design.3.Documents for local requirements as identified by the building official.
