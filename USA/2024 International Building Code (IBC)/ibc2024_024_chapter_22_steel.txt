Chapter 22 Steel
User notes:
About this chapter:
Chapter 22 provides the minimum requirements for the design and construction of structural steel (including composite construction), cold-formed steel, steel joists, steel cable structures and steel storage racks. This chapter specifies appropriate design and construction standards for these types of structures. It also provides a road map of the applicable technical requirements for steel structures. Chapter 22 requires that the design and use of steel structures and components be in accordance with the applicable specifications and standards of the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the Steel Joist Institute and the American Society of Civil Engineers.This chapter was extensively reorganized for the 2024 edition. For complete information, see the relocations table in the Preface information of this code. Code development reminder:
Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
