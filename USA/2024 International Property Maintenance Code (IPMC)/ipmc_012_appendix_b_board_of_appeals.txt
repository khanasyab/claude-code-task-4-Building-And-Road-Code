Appendix A Boarding Standard
The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.
User notes:
About this appendix: Appendix A provides minimum specifications for boarding a structure. This can be utilized by a jurisdiction as a set of minimum requirements in order to result in consistent boarding quality. These requirements also provide a reasonable means to eliminate having to approve numerous methods or materials for the boarding and securing of a structure. It is important to note that the provisions of Appendix A are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance of the authority having jurisdiction. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections in this appendix will be considered by the IPMC Code Development Committee during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
