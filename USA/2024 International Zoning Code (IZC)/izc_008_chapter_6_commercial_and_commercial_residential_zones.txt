Chapter 5 Residential Zones
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 5 identifies three divisions of residential zones including single-family, two-family and multiunit residential uses. Once the particular zones are established, provisions for the minimum bulk zoning regulations, such as lot area, structure-to-openspace density, lot dimensions, setback and building height requirements, are indicated. The objective of this chapter is to define residential uses for a jurisdiction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses in order to achieve the maximum social and economic benefit for the community.
