Chapter 6 Commercial and Commercial/Residential Zones
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 6 identifies four divisions of commercial zones, which include minor automotive repair and automotive fuel dispensing facilities; light commercial and group care facilities; amusement centers including bowling alleys, golf driving ranges, miniature golf courses, ice skating rinks, pool and billiard halls; major automotive repair; manufacturing and commercial centers. This chapter also contains two divisions of commercial/residential zones that accommodate residential uses in light and medium commercial zones. Once the particular zones are established, this chapter provides specific minimum bulk zoning restrictions to include lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements.
