Chapter 11 Nonconforming Structures and Uses
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions for nonconforming structures and uses regulated under this code. The primary purpose of this chapter is to ensure that existing structures and current land use practices legally established prior to the adoption of this code are allowed to be continued.
Section 1101 General
CDP
1101.1 Continuance.
CDP
Except as otherwise required by law, a structure or use legally established prior to the adoption date of this code be maintained unchanged. In other than criminal proceedings, the owner, occupant or user shall have the burden to show that the structure, lot or use was lawfully established.
Section 1102 Discontinuance
1102.1 Vacancy.
Any lot or structure, or portion thereof, occupied by a nonconforming use, that is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied by a nonconforming use for a period of 6 months shall not thereafter be occupied, except by a use that conforms to this code.
1102.2 Damage.
If any nonconforming structure or use is, by any cause, damaged to the extent of 50 percent of its value as determined by the code official, it shall not thereafter be reconstructed as such.
Section 1103 Enlargements and Modifications
1103.1 Maintenance and repair.
Maintenance, repairs and structural alterations shall be permitted to be made to nonconforming structures or to a building housing a nonconforming use with valid permits.
1103.2 Changes of nonconforming use.
A change of use of a nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land shall not be made except to that of a conforming use. Where such change is made, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use.
1103.3 Additions.
Additions to nonconforming structures and parking areas shall conform to the requirements of this code. Additions to structures housing nonconforming uses that increase the area of a nonconforming use shall not be made.
