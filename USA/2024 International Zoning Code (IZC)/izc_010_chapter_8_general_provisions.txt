Chapter 7 Factory/Industrial Zones
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 7 identifies three divisions of factory/industrial zones, including a range of factory/industrial zones from light manufacturing or industrial, such as warehouses and auto body shops to heavy manufacturing or industrial, such as automotive dismantling and petroleum refineries. Once the particular zones are established, this chapter provides minimum bulk zoning regulations that establish lot area, structure-to-open-space density, lot dimensions, and setback and building height requirements. The objective of this chapter is to define factory/industrial uses for a jurisdiction to utilize in arranging compatible land uses for the social and economic welfare of the community.
