Chapter 12 Conditional Uses
User notes:
About this chapter: The intent of Chapter 12 is to allow for the occasional need for a use not normally permitted in a particular zoning district due to the unique characteristics and service that use provides to the public. This chapter establishes the requirements for conditionaluse, such as minimum documentation required to support a conditional-use property, conditional-use permits and fees, and the criteria for expiration and revocation of conditional-use permits.
Section 1201 General
CDP
1201.1 Conditional-use permit.
CDP
A conditional-use permit shall be obtained for certain uses, which would become harmonious or compatible with neighboring uses through the application and maintenance of qualifying conditions and located in specific locations within a zone, but shall not be allowed under the general conditions of the zone as stated in this code.
Section 1202 Applications
1202.1 Submittal.
Conditional-use permit applications shall be submitted to the code official as provided in this code. Applications shall be accompanied by maps, drawings, statements or other documents in accordance with the provisions of Section 103.7.4. An appropriate fee shall be collected at the time of submittal as determined by the jurisdiction.
Section 1203 Public Hearing
1203.1 Hearing and action.
Prior to the approval, amending or denial of a conditional-use permit, a public hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of Section 111.1. Upon the completion of said public hearing, the commission or examiner shall render a decision within a time limit as required by law.
Section 1204 Determination
1204.1 Authorization.
The hearing examiner on appeal, shall have the authority to impose conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary to protect and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding area. The authorization of a conditional-use permit shall not be made unless the evidence presented is such to establish:1.That such use will not, under the specific circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the surrounding area and that the proposed use is necessary or desirable and provides a service or facility that contributes to the general well being of the surrounding area.2.That such use will comply with the regulations and conditions specified in this code for such use.3.The planning commission or hearing examiner shall itemize, describe or justify, then have recorded and filed in writing, the conditions imposed on the use.
Section 1205 Expiration and Revocation
1205.1 General.
A conditional-use permit shall be considered to be exercised when the use has been established or when a building permit has been issued and substantial construction accomplished. When such permit is abandoned or discontinued for a period of 1 year, it shall not be reestablished, unless authorized by the planning commission, hearing examiner or legislative body on appeal.A conditional-use permit shall be revoked where the applicant fails to comply with conditions imposed by the hearing examiner.
Section 1206 Amendments
1206.1 General.
An amendment to an approved conditional-use permit shall be submitted to the code official accompanied by supporting information. The planning commission or hearing examiner shall review the amendment and shall be permitted to grant, deny or amend such amendment and impose conditions deemed necessary.
