Chapter 1 Scope and Administration
User note:
About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced. Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Section 101) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 102–107). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-codes as applicable.This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its administration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner.
