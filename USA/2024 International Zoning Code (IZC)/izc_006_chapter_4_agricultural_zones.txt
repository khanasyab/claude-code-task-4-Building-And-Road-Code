Section 303 Zoning Map
303.1 General.
The boundaries of each zoning district are to be indicated on the official zoning map as approved by the legislative authority. Said map and subsequent amendments thereto shall be considered to be a part of this code.
Section 304 Minimum Areas for Zoning Districts
304.1 Classification.
Any territory hereafter annexed shall automatically, upon such annexation, be classified as R, Division 1a, residential district, and be subject to all conditions and regulations applicable to property in such district.
Section 305 Conditional Uses
305.1 General.
INSIGHTS
The principal objective of this zoning code is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses, and for the property location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established by this code. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses that it may be necessary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of this code. INSIGHTS (2)
