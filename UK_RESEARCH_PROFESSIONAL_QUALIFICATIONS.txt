================================================================================
FINAL CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

UK DMRB Professional Qualifications Summary:

1. DMRB GG 102 requires that all organizations demonstrate competent staff are
   assigned to projects, with competency matched to risk and verified against
   technical requirements of the project.

2. Professional registration through Engineering Council (CEng, IEng, EngTech)
   is the standard benchmark for engineering competence in the UK, with
   membership of a Licensed PEI (such as ICE or CIHT) required for registration.

3. CIHT is the specialized body for highways and transportation professionals,
   offering unique qualifications in transport planning (CTPP) and road safety
   audit (Certificate of Competency).

4. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is a fundamental requirement for
   all registered engineers, with CIHT requiring minimum 25 hours annually,
   including decarbonization topics (new requirement).

5. Road Safety Audit work on the UK national network requires a National
   Highways Approved Certificate of Competency, obtained through approved
   training and assessment.

6. UK Civil Service has established competency frameworks for government
   engineers, with progression through defined career pathways and competency
   levels.

7. Professional accountability and code of conduct compliance are fundamental
   to UK engineering practice, with disciplinary mechanisms for breaches.

8. Competency must be matched against project risk - higher risk requires more
   senior, experienced professionals (typically CEng vs. IEng/EngTech).
