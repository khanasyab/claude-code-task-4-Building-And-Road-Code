1.0 INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This section establishes the procedures for obtaining administrative approval
and technical sanction for public works projects and building permits in Pakistan.
The framework ensures fiscal discipline, technical soundness, and transparency
while incorporating modern digital processing systems.

Key Principles:
- Separation of administrative (financial) and technical approvals
- Authority delegation based on project value and complexity
- Due diligence in cost estimation and technical review
- Transparency and audit trail maintenance
- Stakeholder consultation for major projects ⭐
- Digital workflow integration ⭐

================================================================================

================================================================================

2.1 ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL (AA)

   Definition: Formal sanction by competent financial authority for expenditure
   on a proposed project based on administrative and financial considerations.

   Purpose:
   - Ensures project aligns with government priorities and budget
   - Authorizes allocation of funds for project execution
   - Establishes financial ceiling for the project
   - Provides policy-level approval before detailed design

2.2 TECHNICAL SANCTION (TS)

   Definition: Approval by competent technical authority certifying that:
   - Design and specifications are technically sound
   - Proposed construction methods are appropriate
   - Quantities and estimates are accurate and reasonable
   - Project complies with applicable codes and standards
   - Safety and quality requirements are addressed

   Purpose:
   - Ensures technical soundness before construction
   - Validates cost estimates and specifications
   - Authorizes commencement of procurement/construction
   - Establishes technical baseline for execution

2.3 REVISED ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL (RAA)

   Required when: Original approved cost is likely to be exceeded by >10% or
   PKR 10 million, whichever is lower.

   Procedure: Same as original AA, submitted with justification for cost increase.

2.4 REVISED TECHNICAL SANCTION (RTS)

   Required when: Design changes, specification modifications, or scope variations
   occur during execution.

   Procedure: Same as original TS, with comparative statement showing changes.
