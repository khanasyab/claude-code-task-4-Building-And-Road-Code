**Para 1.53 (Divisional Officer Context):**

"Assistant Executive and Assistant or temporary Engineers may be placed in
charge of Divisions, either to fill short temporary vacancies or because
Executive Engineer is available; they exercise the powers and bear the

  full Divisional Officer powers

- Emphasizes importance of SDO competency development

**Para 1.57 (Transfer Authority):**

"Divisional Officers may transfer establishment other than Sub-Divisional

**Para 1.62 (Supervisory Relationship):**

"The relative position of a Divisional Accountant to the Divisional Officer in
respect of accounts is analogous to that of a Sub-Divisional Officer to a
Divisional Officer in respect of works and the responsibilities of the latter
for the work of the Divisional Accountant are similar to those which attach to
him respect of the execution of works in the charge of other subordinates."
