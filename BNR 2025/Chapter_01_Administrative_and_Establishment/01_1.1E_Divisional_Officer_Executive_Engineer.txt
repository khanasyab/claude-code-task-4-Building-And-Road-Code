   - Profitability (for Employer: value for money)
   - Safety records (incidents, near-misses, lost-time injuries)
   - Quality of work (defects, rework, test results)
   - Project team satisfaction (responsiveness, cooperation)
   - Client satisfaction (complaints, quality perception)

B. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
   - Objective setting with clear, measurable criteria (established in advance)
   - Performance metrics aligned with project objectives
   - Health and safety regulations compliance
   - Timely and constructive feedback throughout project
   - Detailed records of performance, incidents, challenges, improvements

   - Score on weighted criteria (quality 30%, progress 25%, safety 20%,
     documentation 15%, compliance 10%)
   - Discuss evaluation results with contractor project manager

8.4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES

A. TIERED APPROACH (LEAST TO MOST FORMAL)

**1. Negotiation:**
   - Simplest form; parties discuss directly
   - No third-party intervention
   - Fastest and least expensive
   - First resort for all disputes

**2. Mediation:**
   - Independent third party facilitates discussion
   - Mediator doesn't make decisions
   - Confidential, non-binding
   - Allows creative solutions courts may not provide

**3. Adjudication:**
   - Particularly used in construction/infrastructure
   - Quick process, economical
   - Provides interim decision (binding until final resolution)
   - Common in UK and FIDIC contracts
   - Pakistan: Emerging practice, not yet widely adopted

**4. Arbitration:**
   - Often stipulated as primary mechanism in contracts
   - Neutral third party (arbitrator) makes binding award
   - Effective for high-stakes, complex disputes
   - Private process
   - Pakistan: Per Arbitration Act 1940 (as amended) or international arbitration
     (UNCITRAL)

**5. Litigation:**
   - Traditional route through court system (Civil Courts)
   - Judge makes final, binding decision
   - Public process, can be lengthy and expensive
   - Last resort

B. CONTRACTUAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION (FIDIC/PPRA)
   - Engineer's determination (first step)
   - Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) or Dispute Review Board (DRB)
   - Arbitration (if not satisfied with DAB decision)
   - Litigation (only if arbitration waived or failed)

C. BEST PRACTICE - TIERED CLAUSES
   - Modern contracts combine methods
   - Require parties to start with negotiation
   - Move to mediation if negotiation fails
   - Proceed to adjudication/arbitration only as last resort
   - Saves time and costs, preserves relationships

D. COMMON DISPUTE TYPES
   - Delays and scheduling conflicts
   - Payment issues and budget allocations
   - Quality of workmanship/materials
   - Contractor-subcontractor disagreements
   - Design changes and variations
