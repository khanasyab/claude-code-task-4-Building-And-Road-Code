PART F: MODERN RECRUITMENT PRACTICES
================================================================================

6. CONTEMPORARY HR AND RECRUITMENT BEST PRACTICES (2025)

**Source:** Web research on modern public sector recruitment trends

6.1 SKILLS-BASED HIRING REVOLUTION

A. SHIFT FROM CREDENTIALS TO COMPETENCIES

**Market Trend (2024-2025):**
- 81% of organizations practicing skills-based hiring (up from 56% in 2022)
- 75% of HR professionals believe skills-based hiring is the future
- Skills-assessed hires outperform resume-screened hires by 36% in first year
- 25-30% better retention rates for skills-based hires
- 9% longer tenure at organizations

**Fundamental Philosophy Change:**
- From "degree and pedigree" to "will and skill"
- Direct competency evaluation preferred over proxy measures
- Focus on demonstrable capabilities rather than credentials
- Skills assessments better predict job performance

B. THREE-STAGE IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

STAGE 1: IDENTIFYING JOB REQUIREMENTS
- Define actual competencies needed for the role
- Distinguish essential vs. desirable qualifications
- Identify transferable skills
- Focus on job-specific technical skills

STAGE 2: CREATING JOB DESCRIPTIONS
- Write inclusive descriptions emphasizing skills over credentials
- Use gender-neutral language
- Remove unnecessary educational barriers
- Emphasize learning and development opportunities

STAGE 3: ASSESSING CANDIDATES
- Use assessments or screening methods to evaluate competencies
- Practical tests and simulations
- Portfolio evaluation
- Competency-based interviews

C. INCLUSIVE JOB DESCRIPTIONS

**Research Finding:**
- Women apply only to jobs meeting 100% of criteria vs. 60% for men
- Over-specification reduces diverse candidate pools

**Best Practices:**
- Distinguish "required" from "preferred" qualifications
- Emphasize transferable skills that can be taught
- Remove gendered language and coded terms
- Focus on role outcomes rather than credentials
- Highlight organizational support for development

6.2 COMPETENCY-BASED SELECTION FRAMEWORKS

  * Subordinates (upward assessment)
  * External stakeholders (client feedback)
- Illuminates behavioral competencies
- Helps mitigate individual bias
- Comprehensive performance picture

5) ANONYMIZED SELECTION PROCESS

**Innovation in Public Sector:**
