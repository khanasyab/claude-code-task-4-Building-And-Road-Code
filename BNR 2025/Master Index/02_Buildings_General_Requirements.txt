BNR 2025 - MASTER INDEX
BUILDINGS - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This master index provides a comprehensive framework for general building
requirements, blending the historical Bangladesh National Building Code (BNR
1994) structure with modern international building standards from the USA
International Building Code (IBC 2024).

The index integrates:
- Traditional BNR Chapter III provisions on public buildings, residences, and
  fixtures
- Modern occupancy classification systems and use groups
- Contemporary height and area limitations
- Site requirements and planning considerations
- Building classification and construction type systems

Modern additions are marked with ⭐ to distinguish them from traditional BNR
provisions.
