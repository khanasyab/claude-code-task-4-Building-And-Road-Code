          V = Design base shear (total horizontal seismic force)
          Cs = Seismic response coefficient
          W = Effective seismic weight

          Seismic Response Coefficient:
          Cs = (Z × I × Sa) / (R × g)

          Where:

          Cvx = (wx × hx^k) / Σ(wi × hi^k)

          Distribution Exponent k:
          - k = 1.0 for T ≤ 0.5 seconds (short, stiff buildings)

    6.1.1 Ultimate Strength Method (LRFD)
          Based on: ACI 318 (adapted for Bangladesh)

          Design Equation:
          φRn ≥ Σ(γi × Qi)

    6.2.3 Modulus of Elasticity
          Es = 200,000 MPa (for all grades)

6.3 FLEXURAL DESIGN (BEAMS AND SLABS)
    6.3.1 Design Moment Capacity
          Nominal Moment Capacity:
          Mn = As × fy × (d - a/2)

          Where:
          As = Area of tension reinforcement (mm²)
          fy = Yield strength of steel (MPa)
          d = Effective depth (mm)
          a = Depth of equivalent rectangular stress block
              = (As × fy) / (0.85 × f'c × b)
          b = Width of beam (mm)
          f'c = Specified concrete compressive strength (MPa)

          Design Requirement:
          φMn ≥ Mu

          Where:
          φ = 0.90 (flexure)
          Mu = Factored design moment

    6.3.2 Reinforcement Limits
          Minimum Reinforcement:
          As,min = (0.25√f'c / fy) × b × d

          Also check:
          As,min ≥ (1.4 / fy) × b × d

          Use larger of the two values.

          Maximum Reinforcement:
          For ductility, limit reinforcement such that:
          Net tensile strain ≥ 0.004

          This ensures tension-controlled section (φ = 0.90)

CHAPTER 8: DETAILING OF REINFORCEMENT FOR SEISMIC RESISTANCE
================================================================================

8.1 PHILOSOPHY OF DUCTILE DETAILING
    8.1.1 Importance of Ductility
          Ductility = Ability to undergo large inelastic deformation
          without failure

          Critical for Earthquake Resistance:
          - Dissipates earthquake energy
          - Prevents sudden brittle failure
          - Provides warning of distress
          - Allows force redistribution
          - Essential for structures with R > 3

    8.1.2 Capacity Design Concept
          Design Hierarchy (Desirable Failure Sequence):
          1. Beams yield first (plastic hinges form in beams)
          2. Columns remain elastic (avoid soft story)
          3. Joints remain elastic (transfer forces)
          4. Foundations do not fail

          Implementation:
          - "Strong column - weak beam" requirement
          - Design columns for amplified moments
          - Design joints for member capacities
          - Design shear for flexural overstrength

8.2 DUCTILE DETAILING OF BEAMS
    8.2.1 Longitudinal Reinforcement
          Minimum and Maximum Limits (as per Chapter 6)

          Reinforcement Continuity:
          At Supports (Negative Moment Region):
          - Top reinforcement: Extend full length plus development
          - At least 1/4 of maximum positive moment steel continues to support
          - Minimum 2 bars continuous through support

          At Midspan (Positive Moment Region):
          - Bottom reinforcement: Based on moment design
          - At least 1/4 of maximum negative moment steel continues to midspan
          - Minimum 2 bars continuous

    8.2.2 Transverse Reinforcement (Stirrups) - Seismic Detailing
          CRITICAL REGIONS (SEISMIC ZONES 1-3):
          Length of Critical Region:
          - Extends 2 × beam depth from face of support
          - Both ends of beam

          Stirrup Requirements in Critical Regions:
          - Closed stirrups mandatory (135° seismic hooks)

          - Avoid splicing in critical regions if possible
          - Lap length: 1.3-1.7 × ld (longer in seismic zones)

          - Both ends of column (top and bottom)
          - Above and below each floor level

          SPACING IN CRITICAL REGIONS:

          - 1/4 × minimum column dimension
          - 6 × diameter of longitudinal bars
          - So = 100 + (350 - hx)/3 mm

          - Hooks engage longitudinal bars
          - Overlapping hoops acceptable
          - Crossties with 90°-135° hooks
          - Alternate hoops may have hooks on opposite ends

          Purpose:
          - Ensure plastic hinges form in beams, not columns
          - Prevent story mechanism (soft story)
          - Columns remain elastic during earthquake

          Exceptions:
          - May be waived at roof level
          - Single-story buildings

    8.3.4 Shear Design for Columns
          Design Shear Force:
          Ve = (Mpr1 + Mpr2) / Ln + Gravity shear

          Where:
          Mpr1, Mpr2 = Probable moment capacities at column ends
          Ln = Clear height of column

          This ensures column can develop full flexural strength
          without prior shear failure.

          - Critical regions at both ends

8.5 SLAB DIAPHRAGM DETAILING
    8.5.1 Diaphragm Action
          Slabs as Horizontal Diaphragms:
          - Transfer lateral forces to vertical elements
          - Distribute forces among shear walls/frames
          - Act as horizontal beams

    8.5.2 Reinforcement Requirements

          - Properly anchored
          - Provide continuity at slab edges

8.6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BANGLADESH
    8.6.1 Soft Story Problem (Critical Issue)
          Common Causes:
          - Open ground floor for parking (no infill walls)
          - Commercial ground floor with large openings
          - Residential floors above with many walls
          - Creates stiffness discontinuity

          Consequences:
          - Excessive deformation in soft story
          - Damage concentration
          - Column failures
          - High collapse risk

          Solutions:
          AVOIDANCE (BEST):
          - Provide infill walls on ground floor
          - Maintain stiffness consistency through height
          - Use shear walls extending through all floors

          IF UNAVOIDABLE:
          - Substantially increase ground floor column sizes
          - Increase ground floor column reinforcement
          - Provide shear walls at ground floor
          - Enhanced ductile detailing
          - Amplify ground story forces (×1.5-2.0)

    8.6.2 Short Column Effect
          Causes:
          - Partial height infill walls (mezzanines)
          - Beams at different levels
          - Sloped grade (stepped foundations)
          - Parapets constraining columns

          Problem:
          - Short column is stiffer, attracts more force
          - Shear failure before flexural yielding (brittle)
          - Cannot develop ductility

          Prevention:
          DESIGN PHASE:
          - Avoid creating short columns
          - Uniform floor heights
          - Detail parapets independent of structure
          - Provide slip joints in partial-height infills

          IF PRESENT:
          - Design for higher shear forces
          - Provide heavy stirrups (close spacing)
          - Consider separating infill from column

    8.6.3 Masonry Infill Interaction
          Effects on Frame Behavior:
          POSITIVE:
          - Increase lateral stiffness
          - Increase strength
          - Reduce story drift

          NEGATIVE:
          - Create short column effects
          - Stress concentrations at corners
          - Torsion if asymmetric distribution
          - Out-of-plane failure risk

          Recommended Practice:
          - Use infills symmetrically in plan
          - Detail to avoid short column effects
          - Provide peripheral reinforcement in infill
          - Connect adequately to frame (but allow some slip)
          - Use engineering brick in seismic zones

    8.6.4 Construction Quality Critical
          Common Problems in Bangladesh:
          - Insufficient concrete cover (corrosion + reduced capacity)
          - Displaced reinforcement during concreting
          - Inadequate stirrup spacing
          - Open stirrups (no confinement)
          - Poor joint reinforcement
          - Poor concrete quality

          Quality Assurance Measures:
          - Proper supervision by qualified engineers
          - Inspection before concrete placement
          - Check reinforcement positioning
          - Verify stirrup spacing and closing
          - Material testing
          - Proper curing

CHAPTER 9: PRESTRESSED CONCRETE
================================================================================

9.1 PRINCIPLES OF PRESTRESSING
    9.1.1 Concept
          Prestressing: Application of permanent compressive stress
          to concrete to counteract tensile stresses from loads

          Benefits:
          - Eliminates or reduces cracking under service loads
          - Enables longer spans with shallower members
          - Reduces deflections
          - Higher strength utilization
          - Reduced weight
          - Better durability (crack-free concrete)

    9.1.2 Methods of Prestressing
          PRE-TENSIONING:
          - Tendons stressed before concrete placement
          - Concrete cast around stressed tendons
          - After hardening, tendons released
          - Prestress transferred by bond
          - Common for precast members

          POST-TENSIONING:
          - Concrete cast with ducts/sleeves
          - After concrete hardens, tendons inserted
          - Tendons stressed against hardened concrete
          - Anchorages at member ends
          - Ducts grouted after stressing
          - Suitable for cast-in-place and precast

9.2 MATERIALS FOR PRESTRESSING

          High-Strength Concrete Required:
          - Minimum f'c = 30 MPa (M30)
          - Typical f'c = 40-50 MPa (M40-M50)
          - At transfer: f'ci = 25-30 MPa minimum
          - High early strength for early transfer

    9.2.2 Prestressing Steel
          Types:
          - High-strength wires: 5-7mm diameter
          - Strands (7-wire): 12.7mm, 15.2mm diameter
          - High-strength bars: 20-40mm diameter

          Properties:

          At Transfer:
          - Compression: 0.60 f'ci
          - Tension: 0.25√f'ci MPa (cracking limit)

          At Service:
          - Compression: 0.45 f'c
          - Tension: 0.50√f'c MPa or zero (full prestress)

    9.3.2 Ultimate Strength Check
          Check Flexural Capacity:
          - Similar to reinforced concrete
          - Account for prestressing force
          - Ensure ductile failure mode

          Shear Design:
          - Prestressed concrete has higher shear capacity
          - Account for prestressing effect

    9.4.2 Time-Dependent Losses
          - Creep of concrete
          - Shrinkage of concrete
          - Relaxation of prestressing steel
