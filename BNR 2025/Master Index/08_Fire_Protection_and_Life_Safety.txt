- Not suitable where freezing possible

DRY PIPE SYSTEM:
- Pipes filled with compressed air/nitrogen
- Sprinkler opens → air releases → water valve opens → water flows
- Delay: 30-60 seconds
- Used in unheated spaces (parking garages, outdoor)

PREACTION SYSTEM:
- Pipes initially dry
- Two-stage activation: 1) Smoke/heat detection → valve opens, fills pipes, 2) Sprinkler fuses → water flows
- Used where accidental discharge unacceptable (data centers, museums)

DELUGE SYSTEM:
- All sprinklers open (no fusible elements)
- Detection system activates control valve → water to all sprinklers simultaneously
- High-hazard areas (chemical storage, aircraft hangars)

- Ordinary hazard: 280 sq m (15-20 sprinklers)

WATER SOURCE:
- Municipal supply (if adequate pressure and flow)
- Dedicated fire water tank + pump (common in Pakistan)
- Tank capacity: System demand × duration + 50% margin

4.4 SPRINKLER TYPES

STANDARD SPRAY (Pendant/Upright):
