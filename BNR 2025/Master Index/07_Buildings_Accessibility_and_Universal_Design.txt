BUILDINGS - ACCESSIBILITY AND UNIVERSAL DESIGN
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This master index provides a comprehensive framework for building accessibility
and universal design, integrating the International Building Code (IBC 2024)
Chapter 11 Accessibility standards with Sri Lanka accessibility regulations
and modern universal design principles.

The index covers:
- IBC Chapter 11 comprehensive structure (accessible routes, parking, facilities)
- Sri Lanka accessibility regulations and standards
- Universal design principles and best practices
- Modern accessibility features (EV charging, adult changing stations, assistive tech)

Modern additions are marked with ⭐ to distinguish them from traditional
IBC provisions and indicate contemporary best practices.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Accessibility and universal design are fundamental to modern building codes
and standards. The IBC Chapter 11 provides comprehensive requirements for
accessible buildings and facilities, addressing:

- Accessible routes and site arrival points
- Accessible entrances and exits
- Accessible parking and passenger loading
- Accessible interior facilities and spaces
- Special occupancies requiring additional accessibility
- Recreational facility accessibility
- Clear wayfinding and signage

Sri Lanka is developing a comprehensive accessibility framework through:
- UDA building regulations
- SLSI adoption of international standards (Eurocodes)
- CIDA specifications for public works
- Professional requirements for qualified designers/engineers
- Harmonization with international best practices

Modern additions to accessibility standards include:
- EV charging stations (sustainable transportation)
- Adult changing stations (dignity and care for persons with disabilities)
- Assistive technology infrastructure (digital accessibility)
- Inclusive recreational facilities (universal participation)
- Sensory-friendly spaces (neurodiversity inclusion)

Universal design principles ensure that accessible buildings benefit everyone:
- Parents with strollers
- Elderly individuals with mobility challenges
- Temporary injury recovery
- General convenience and safety
- Inclusive community participation

Implementation of comprehensive accessibility standards creates buildings and
communities that are welcoming, safe, and inclusive for all individuals,
regardless of ability or disability.
