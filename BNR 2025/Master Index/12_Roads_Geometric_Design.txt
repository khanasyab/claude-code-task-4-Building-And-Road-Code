================================================================================

4.1 MINIMUM RADIUS OF CURVATURE
--------------------------------
Centrifugal force counteracted by:
- Superelevation (banking)
- Side friction

Formula: R = V² / 127 (e + f)
Where:
- R = Radius (m)
- V = Design speed (km/h)
- e = Superelevation rate (decimal, max 0.07 plain, 0.10 mountain)
- f = Side friction factor (0.15-0.35)

4.4 HORIZONTAL CLEARANCE (WIDENING ON CURVES)
----------------------------------------------
Extra width needed for:
- Off-tracking (rear wheels track inside front wheels)
- Driver difficulty steering on curve

Widening (We):

6.3 ROADWAY WIDTH (TOTAL PAVEMENT)
-----------------------------------
Roadway width = (Number of lanes × Lane width) + Shoulders

Examples:

2-Lane NH (plain terrain):
- 2 × 3.5 m lanes + 2 × 2.5 m shoulders = 12 m paved width

4-Lane Divided NH:
- Each carriageway: 2 × 3.5 m + 2 × 2.5 m = 12 m × 2 = 24 m total

6-Lane Expressway (CPEC):
- Each carriageway: 3 × 3.75 m + 2 × 3.0 m = 17.25 m × 2 = 34.5 m total

Base: IRC:73-2018 Section 6.2

6.4 MEDIANS
-----------
Purpose: Separate opposing traffic, recovery area, aesthetics

Width:

Design solutions:
- Hairpin bends (minimum radius 15-20 m, 10% superelevation)
- Tunnels (Lowari: 10.4 km, longest road tunnel Pakistan)
- Retaining walls, gabion walls
- Avalanche galleries, rock sheds

Karakoram Highway specifics:
- Elevation: 0 m (Hasan Abdal) to 4,714 m (Khunjerab Pass)
- 810 bridges, 1,800 culverts (1,300 km length)
- Maintenance challenges: Landslides, glacial floods (GLOFs)

Base: IRC:52-2019 (Recommendations for Estimating the Resistance of Soil Below the Maximum Scour Level in the Design of Well Foundations of Bridges)

8.2 DESERT TERRAIN DESIGN (BALOCHISTAN)
----------------------------------------
Challenges:
- Extreme temperatures (52°C summer)
- Sand dune migration
- Flash floods (wadis)
- Limited water for construction

Design solutions:
- High-type pavement (flexible, withstand thermal stress)
- Dune stabilization (vegetation, geotextiles)
- Elevated causeways across wadis
- Dust palliatives (calcium chloride, bitumen)

Base: IRC:37-2018 (Guidelines for Design of Flexible Pavements) - Special provisions

8.3 FLOOD-PRONE AREAS (INDUS PLAIN)
------------------------------------
Challenges:
- Seasonal flooding (monsoon, glacial melt)
- High water table
- Soft subgrade (silts, clays)

Design solutions:
- High embankments (above 100-year flood level)
- Adequate hydraulic structures (bridges, culverts)
- Subsurface drainage (reduce pore pressure)
- Soil stabilization (lime, cement)

Pakistan flood history:
- 2010 floods: 13,000 km roads damaged (Rs 150 billion loss)
- 2022 floods: 13,115 km roads damaged (Sindh, Balochistan worst)

SECTION 9: ACCESSIBILITY AND NON-MOTORIZED TRANSPORT
================================================================================

9.1 PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
--------------------------
Footpaths (sidewalks):
- Minimum width: 1.5 m (clear)
- Desirable width: 2.0-3.0 m (high pedestrian volume)
- Cross-slope: ≤2% (accessibility)
- Separation from carriageway: Kerb (150 mm high)

Pedestrian crossings:
- Zebra crossings: Painted stripes, signage
- Pelican crossings: Signal-controlled (pedestrian-actuated)
- Grade-separated: Footbridge, underpass (major highways)

Pakistan challenges:
- Footpaths often non-existent or encroached
- Major cities (Karachi, Lahore): Footbridges at key locations
- Enforcement weak (pedestrians walk on roadway)

Base: IRC:103-2012 (Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities)

9.2 BICYCLE FACILITIES
----------------------
Dedicated cycle tracks:
- Width: 1.5 m (one-way), 2.5 m (two-way)
- Separation from motor traffic: Physical barrier or 1.5 m buffer
- Surface: Smooth, paved (asphalt or concrete)

Shared facilities:
- Shared footpath: Width ≥3.0 m (pedestrian + cyclist)
- Shared roadway: Low-speed (<40 km/h), low volume (<3,000 AADT)

Pakistan context:
- Bicycles common in small towns, rural areas
- Major cities: Limited cycling (safety concerns, traffic)
- Lahore: Pilot cycle track projects (Canal Road, 2016)

Base: IRC:11-2018 (Guidelines for Accommodation of Utility Services on Road Reserves)

9.3 MOTORCYCLE LANES
--------------------
Pakistan-specific consideration:
- Motorcycles: 50-70% of vehicle fleet (urban areas)
- Safety: High fatality rates (no helmets, weaving, overloading)

Dedicated motorcycle lanes:
- Width: 2.0-2.5 m
- Location: Left side (slow traffic)
- Physical separation from cars/trucks (barrier or markings)

Implementation:
- Islamabad Expressway: Motorcycle lane pilot (2018)
- Results: Mixed (encroachment by cars, rickshaws)

Base: Pakistan Road Safety Vision 2030

SECTION 10: COORDINATION OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
================================================================================

10.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
-----------------------
Good design:
- Vertical alignment follows terrain (minimize earthwork)
- Horizontal alignment avoids obstacles (buildings, utilities)
- Coordination creates aesthetically pleasing, safe roadway

Avoid:
- Sharp horizontal curve at crest of vertical curve (hidden curve)
- Sharp curve immediately after long tangent (speed trap)
- Vertical curve within horizontal curve (if possible)

Desirable:
- Vertical curve longer than horizontal curve (or vice versa)
- Tangent grades on horizontal curves (easier for drivers)

Base: IRC:73-2018 Section 9

10.2 3D ALIGNMENT DESIGN
------------------------
Modern practice:
- CAD software (AutoCAD Civil 3D, Bentley OpenRoads)
- Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from LiDAR, photogrammetry
- Optimization algorithms (minimum earthwork, best alignment)

Pakistan practice:
- NHA projects: 3D design standard (CPEC routes)
- Provincial highways: Variable (some still 2D design)

Base: NHA CAD Standards Manual 2020
