================================================================================
SECTION 1: PAVEMENT TYPES AND SELECTION
================================================================================

1.1 FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS
----------------------
Structure (top to bottom):
1. Surface course: Bituminous concrete (25-40 mm)
2. Binder course: Dense bituminous macadam (50-75 mm)
3. Base course: Water-bound macadam or crushed stone (150-250 mm)
4. Sub-base: Granular material (150-300 mm)
5. Subgrade: Compacted soil (natural or stabilized)

Advantages:
- Lower initial cost
- Easier maintenance (patching, overlays)
- Comfortable ride (flexible surface)

Disadvantages:
- Shorter life (15-20 years)
- Higher maintenance frequency
- Deformation under heavy loads (rutting)

Pakistan usage: 95% of road network (cost-effective)

Base: IRC:37-2018 Section 2

1.2 RIGID PAVEMENTS
-------------------
Structure:
1. Concrete slab: Plain cement concrete (150-300 mm)
2. Sub-base: Dry lean concrete (100-150 mm) or granular (150-200 mm)
3. Subgrade: Compacted soil

Advantages:
- Long life (30-40 years)
- Low maintenance
- High load-bearing capacity

Disadvantages:
- High initial cost (2-3× flexible)
- Difficult repairs (slab replacement)
- Rough ride (joints)

Pakistan usage: 5% (motorways, airports, industrial areas)

Examples:
- M-1/M-2 Motorways: Rigid pavement (original construction)
- Jinnah International Airport Karachi: Concrete runways/taxiways

Base: IRC:58-2015 Section 2

1.3 COMPOSITE PAVEMENTS
-----------------------

SECTION 2: SUBGRADE EVALUATION
================================================================================

2.1 CALIFORNIA BEARING RATIO (CBR)
-----------------------------------
Definition: Penetration resistance of soil compared to standard crushed stone

Test method:
- Laboratory CBR: Compacted soil in mold, soaked 4 days
- Field CBR: In-situ testing with portable equipment

CBR values (typical Pakistan soils):

Soil type              | CBR (%) | Subgrade category
Clay (soft)            | 1-3     | Very poor
Clay (stiff)           | 3-7     | Poor to fair
Sandy silt             | 4-8     | Fair
Silty sand             | 8-15    | Good
Well-graded gravel     | 15-30   | Very good
Crushed stone          | 50-80   | Excellent

Design CBR:
- Average of lowest 25% of test results
- Minimum 3 tests per km

Pakistan regional CBR:
- Indus plains (Sindh, Punjab): 2-8% (clay, silt)
- Potohar plateau: 4-10% (weathered shale, sandy clay)
- Mountainous areas: 10-20% (gravelly soils, weathered rock)

Base: IRC:37-2018 Section 3.2

2.2 SUBGRADE IMPROVEMENT
-------------------------
Methods for low CBR (<3%):

Moisture control:
- Drainage: Subsurface drains, prevent water infiltration
- Moisture content: Compact at optimum moisture content (OMC)

Soil stabilization:
- Lime stabilization: 2-6% lime (clayey soils, increase CBR 200-400%)
- Cement stabilization: 3-8% cement (sandy soils, CBR >15%)
- Fly ash: 10-20% (cost-effective, use power plant waste)

Geosynthetics:
- Geotextiles: Separation, filtration
- Geogrids: Reinforcement (increase CBR effective by 1.5-2×)

Replacement:
- Excavate poor soil, replace with granular material (expensive, limited depth)

Pakistan practice:
- Lime stabilization common (Sindh, Punjab clayey soils)
- Fly ash available (Jamshoro, Muzaffargarh thermal power plants)

Multi-Axle Truck (MAV)    | 3.5-7.0
Bus                      | 2.0-4.0

Cumulative standard axles (CSA):
CSA = 365 × CVPD × VDF × [(1+r)ⁿ - 1] / r

Where:
- CVPD = Commercial vehicles per day (initial)
- VDF = Vehicle damage factor
- r = Annual traffic growth rate (5-7% Pakistan)
- n = Design life (years)

Traffic categories:
