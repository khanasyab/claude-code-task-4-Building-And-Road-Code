SECTION 2: DESIGN LOADS AND LOAD COMBINATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 DEAD LOADS
--------------
Components:
- Self-weight: Concrete (25 kN/m³), steel (78.5 kN/m³)
- Superimposed dead load (SIDL): Wearing coat (80-100 mm BC, 22 kN/m³), railings, utilities

Wearing coat:
- Minimum 80 mm bituminous concrete
- Load: 1.8 kN/m² (80 mm × 22 kN/m³)
- Future resurfacing: Add 40 mm (0.9 kN/m²)

Base: IRC:6-2017 Section 201

2.2 LIVE LOADS (VEHICULAR)
---------------------------
STANDARD IRC LOADING (CLASS A):

IRC Class A (Single Lane):
- Tracked vehicle: 700 kN (70 tonne)
- Wheeled vehicle: 550 kN total
  - Drive truck: 200 kN (2 axles)
  - Trailer: 350 kN (4 axles)
- Contact area: 3.6 m × 0.75 m (tracked)

IRC Class AA (Heavy Loading):
- Tracked vehicle: 1,000 kN (100 tonne)
- Wheeled: 760 kN (76 tonne)
- Used for major highways, industrial routes

IRC Class 70R (Wheeled):
- 1,000 kN total (100 tonne truck)
- 5 axles (200 kN per axle, rear 3 axles)
- Bogey spacing: 1.2 m
- Most common Pakistan design load (post-2010)

IRC Class A Train:
- Multiple Class A vehicles (congestion loading)
- Spacing: 1.2 m minimum
- For long-span bridges

Impact factor (dynamic increment):
- For spans <9 m: 25% (1.25 × static load)
- For spans 9-45 m: 25% - 0.0028 × (span in m - 9)
- For spans >45 m: 15%

Pakistan practice:
- Class 70R standard (NHA bridges post-2005)
- Overloading common (20-30% above legal limits) - design conservatism needed

Base: IRC:6-2017 Sections 204-209

2.3 SEISMIC LOADS
-----------------
Pakistan seismic zones (IRC:6 adapted):

Zone | Area (Pakistan)                  | PGA (g) | Z-factor
II   | Karachi, Hyderabad (coastal)    | 0.10    | 0.10
III  | Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan      | 0.16    | 0.16
IV   | Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta     | 0.24    | 0.24
V    | Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, Gilgit   | 0.36    | 0.36

Seismic design methodology:
- Elastic response spectrum method (medium/major bridges)
- Equivalent static method (minor bridges)

Horizontal seismic coefficient (Ah):
Ah = (Z / 2) × (Sa / g) / (R / I)

Where:
- Z = Zone factor (0.10 to 0.36)
- Sa/g = Spectral acceleration coefficient (1.36 for rock, 1.67 for soft soil)
- R = Response reduction factor (2.5 for critical, 3.0 for normal bridges)
- I = Importance factor (1.5 for critical, 1.0 for normal)

Example (Zone V, normal bridge, rock):
Ah = (0.36 / 2) × (1.36) / (3.0 / 1.0) = 0.0816 (8.16% of dead load)

2005 Kashmir Earthquake lessons:
- Unseated girders (inadequate bearing lengths)
- Pier collapse (shear failure, inadequate transverse reinforcement)
- Abutment movement (soil liquefaction)

Mandatory provisions (Pakistan post-2005):
- Minimum support length: 400 mm + 10 mm per meter span + seismic displacement
- Shear keys at bearings (prevent transverse movement)
- Ductile detailing (confined concrete, closely-spaced stirrups)

Base: IRC:6-2017 Section 219
Pakistan Building Code Seismic Provisions 2007

2.4 WIND LOADS
--------------
Design wind speed:
- Basic wind speed (Vb): 39-55 m/s (Pakistan, 50-year return)
- Design wind speed (Vd): Vb × K1 × K2 × K3
  - K1 = Risk coefficient (1.0 for normal, 1.05 for important)
  - K2 = Terrain category (1.0 open terrain, 0.85 urban)
  - K3 = Topography (1.0 flat, 1.2 hills/valleys)

Wind pressure:
Pz = 0.6 × Vd² (N/m²)

Example (Vd = 50 m/s):
Pz = 0.6 × 50² = 1,500 N/m² = 1.5 kN/m²

Wind force on structure:
F = Pz × A × Cd
- A = Projected area
- Cd = Drag coefficient (1.5 for trusses, 2.0 for girders)

Pakistan cyclone areas:
- Coastal Sindh (Karachi, Thatta): Higher wind design (55 m/s)
- Interior (Lahore, Multan): Moderate (47 m/s)
- Northern Areas: High altitude winds (50-60 m/s, but lighter structures)

Base: IRC:6-2017 Section 212

2.5 LOAD COMBINATIONS
----------------------
LIMIT STATE DESIGN (LSD):

Ultimate Limit State (ULS):
- Basic: 1.35 DL + 1.5 LL
- Seismic: 1.0 DL ± 1.5 EQ (no live load, or 0.2 LL if considered)
- Wind: 1.0 DL + 0.9 LL + 1.5 WL

Serviceability Limit State (SLS):
- Characteristic: 1.0 DL + 1.0 LL (deflection, cracking checks)

Base: IRC:21-2000 Section 4
IRC:112-2020 Section 16

3.3 BOX GIRDER BRIDGES
-----------------------
Advantages:
- High torsional rigidity (ideal for curved bridges)
- Efficient section (reduced dead weight)
- Aesthetic

Types:

- Multi-cell (wide bridges, 2-4 cells)

Construction:
- Cast-in-place: Formwork, pour concrete (slower, flexible geometry)
- Precast segments: Match-cast, post-tensioned (faster, quality control)

Design considerations:
- Longitudinal bending: Flexural theory
- Transverse bending: Top slab, bottom slab (spanning between webs)
- Shear lag: Effective flange width (not fully effective in wide boxes)
- Torsion: St. Venant + warping torsion

Pakistan examples:

Base: IRC:112-2020 Section 16.4

================================================================================
SECTION 4: SUBSTRUCTURE DESIGN
================================================================================

4.1 ABUTMENTS
-------------
Types:

Loads on abutments:
- Vertical: Dead load, live load (bearing reactions)
- Horizontal: Earth pressure (active), braking force, seismic
- Horizontal earth pressure: Ka × γ × H² / 2 (per m width)
  - Ka = Active earth pressure coefficient (0.3-0.4 for granular backfill)
  - γ = Soil unit weight (18-20 kN/m³)
  - H = Retained height (m)

Bearing area check:

- No scour risk (dry locations)

Types:
- Isolated footing (single column/pier)
- Combined footing (two piers close together)
- Strip footing (wall abutment)

Design:
- Base area = (Load / Allowable bearing pressure) × FS
- Thickness: Punching shear, flexural steel requirements
- Minimum depth below ground: 1.5 m (frost protection, scour)

Pakistan practice:
- Limited use (most bridges over rivers, scour risk)
- Used for grade-separated interchanges (dry locations)

Base: IRC:78-2014 Section 705

5.2 PILE FOUNDATIONS
--------------------
Used when:
- Weak surface soil (bearing capacity <100 kN/m²)
- Deep competent strata (rock, dense sand)
- Scour depth >3 m

DRIVEN PILES:
- Precast RC piles (square/octagonal, 250-500 mm)
- Steel H-piles (HP sections)
- Driven by drop hammer, diesel hammer, vibratory
- Capacity: 500-1,500 kN per pile (typical)
- Pakistan: Limited use (hard driving in gravelly soils)

BORED CAST-IN-PLACE PILES:
- Rotary drilling, concrete poured in drilled hole
- Diameter: 600-2,000 mm
- Depth: 10-50 m (typical), 80 m (maximum)
- Capacity: 1,000-10,000 kN per pile
- Pakistan: Most common (versatile, any soil/rock)

- Routine tests: 2% of piles
- Non-destructive: PIT (pile integrity test), CSL (crosshole sonic logging)

Base: IRC:78-2014 Section 706

5.3 WELL FOUNDATIONS
--------------------
Traditional Indian subcontinent method:
- Open caissons (wells) sunk by excavation
- Circular or dumbbell shape
- Used extensively Pakistan (70% of major bridges)

Components:
- Cutting edge: Bottom, sharp edge (penetrate soil)
- Steining: Vertical cylindrical wall (RC, 1.0-1.5 m thick)
- Cap: Top slab (distribute load to steining)

Construction:
1. Build steining (1st lift, 3-6 m height)
2. Excavate inside (grab, dewatering)
3. Well sinks under self-weight
4. Add more steining lifts
5. Reach founding depth (rock or dense sand)
6. Seal bottom (concrete plug)
7. Fill well (sand or concrete)
8. Construct cap

Sinking methods:
- Open dredging (above water, dry season)
- Dewatering + mechanical excavation (water table <5 m below)
- Pneumatic sinking (compressed air, deep water - rare Pakistan)

Advantages:
- Large diameter (3-8 m) - high capacity
- Visible construction (quality control)
- Proven technology (100+ years experience)

Disadvantages:
- Labor-intensive
- Slow (1-2 m per day sinking rate)
- Tilt/shift risks (requires skilled supervision)

Pakistan examples:
- Sukkur Barrage Bridge: 66 wells (6-8 m diameter)
- Jinnah Bridge: Wells in Indus riverbed (15-20 m depth)

Base: IRC:78-2014 Section 707

5.4 SCOUR PROTECTION
--------------------
Pakistan rivers: High scour risk (monsoon floods, glacial melt surges)

Design scour depth (Lacey's formula):
Dsm = 1.34 × (Q / f)^(1/3)

Where:
- Dsm = Mean scour depth (m)
- Q = Discharge (m³/s) - 100-year flood
- f = Silt factor (1.76 × √d, d = median grain size mm)

Maximum scour depth: 2 × Dsm (at piers, constrictions)

Foundation depth:
- Minimum: 1.5 × Maximum scour depth below riverbed
- Rock: Minimum 2 m socketing into sound rock

Scour countermeasures:
- Riprap (stone pitching): 300-600 mm size, graded
- Apron: Concrete or stone blocks, 10-15 m upstream/downstream
- Guide bunds: Direct flow, reduce attack angle
- Launching aprons: Flexible mattress (settles with scour, protects)

2010/2022 flood failures:
- Inadequate scour depth assessment (underestimated floods)
- Poor construction (riprap washed away)
- Maintenance neglect (aprons damaged, not repaired)

Base: IRC:5-2015 Section 706

================================================================================
SECTION 6: BEARINGS
================================================================================

6.1 TYPES OF BEARINGS
---------------------
ELASTOMERIC BEARINGS (MOST COMMON PAKISTAN):

- Allow rotation, limited translation
- Load range: 500-5,000 kN per bearing
- Economical, low maintenance

POT BEARINGS:
- Steel pot + rubber pad + piston
- Fixed or guided/free sliding
- Load range: 2,000-50,000 kN
- Used for long-span bridges

ROCKER/ROLLER BEARINGS:
- Steel, allow rotation + movement
- Traditional (less common now, maintenance-intensive)

SEISMIC ISOLATION BEARINGS:
- Lead-rubber bearings (LRB): Energy dissipation
- Friction pendulum bearings (FPB): Large displacements
- High-seismic zones (Kashmir) - modern bridges

Design requirements:
- Thermal movement: ±ΔL = α × L × ΔT
  - α = Coefficient of thermal expansion (10-12 × 10⁻⁶ /°C for concrete)
  - L = Length from fixed point (m)
  - ΔT = Temperature range (Pakistan: 60-70°C range, -10 to +50°C)

Example (50 m span):
ΔL = 12 × 10⁻⁶ × 50,000 mm × 60°C = 36 mm (each direction)

- Creep and shrinkage: Additional 5-10 mm (prestressed concrete)

Support length:
- Minimum bearing length: 400 mm + 10 mm per meter span + seismic displacement

Base: IRC:83 Part II-2015 (Standard Specifications for Road Bridges - Bearings, Part II - Elastomeric Bearings)

================================================================================
SECTION 7: BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION METHODS
================================================================================

7.1 CAST-IN-PLACE CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------------
Formwork (shuttering):
- Timber, steel, or aluminum forms
- Support: Scaffolding, falsework (temporary supports)

Casting sequence:
1. Substructure (foundations, piers, abutments)
2. Bearings installation
3. Deck formwork erection
4. Reinforcement placing, pre-stressing ducts (if PSC)
5. Concrete pouring (monolithic or stages)
6. Curing (14-28 days)
7. Post-tensioning (if applicable)
8. Formwork removal
9. Finishing (railings, wearing coat, expansion joints)

Advantages:
- Flexible geometry (curved, variable depth)
- No transport limits (span, width)

Disadvantages:
- Slow (weather-dependent)
- Traffic disruption (formwork below)

Pakistan usage: 60% of bridges (small to medium spans)

Base: IRC:112-2020 Chapter 18

7.2 PRECAST CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------
I-Girders/Box girders:
- Cast in precasting yard (quality control)
- Transport to site (truck or rail)
- Erect with crane
- Cast deck slab in-situ or use precast deck panels

Advantages:
- Fast (parallel fabrication + construction)
- High quality (controlled environment)
- Minimal site disruption

Disadvantages:
- Transport limits (span <30 m typically, width <3.5 m)
- Heavy cranes required

Pakistan examples:
- Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway (M-1): Precast I-girders
- Lahore Orange Line: Precast segmental box girders (span-by-span)

Base: IRC:112-2020 Chapter 19

7.3 INCREMENTAL LAUNCHING
--------------------------
Method:
- Cast deck segments at one end (abutment)
- Push/pull entire deck across piers
- Repeat until full span completed

Launching nose:
- Steel truss at front (reduces cantilever moment during launch)

Suitable for:
- Long viaducts (multiple equal spans)
- Congested sites (minimal ground equipment)

Pakistan usage: Limited (few major viaducts, technique not widely known)

Example: China-built CPEC bridges (some incremental launching used)
