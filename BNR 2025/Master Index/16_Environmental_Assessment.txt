- Blasting: Rock excavation (120-140 dBA at source)
- Duration: Typically daytime (7 AM - 7 PM), occasional night work

Vibration sources:
- Construction: Pile driving, blasting, heavy equipment
- Traffic: Heavy trucks on rough pavements (potholes, joints)

Base: DMRB LA 111

3.2 NOISE STANDARDS (PAKISTAN NEQS)
------------------------------------
Noise level limits (dBA):

Area category       | Day (6 AM - 10 PM) | Night (10 PM - 6 AM)
Residential         | 55                 | 45
Commercial          | 65                 | 55
Industrial          | 75                 | 65
Silence zone*       | 50                 | 40

*Silence zone: Within 100 m of hospitals, schools, courts

Measurement:
- Leq (equivalent continuous sound level): Energy average over time period
- L10, L90: Percentile levels (10% exceedance = L10, background = L90)

Pakistan urban noise (typical):
- Residential areas: 60-75 dBA (day), 55-65 dBA (night) - exceed standards
- Commercial (markets): 70-85 dBA - severe exceedance
- Major highways: 75-85 dBA at roadside

Sources:
- Traffic: 60-70%
- Horns: 15-20% (excessive horn use Pakistan, cultural factor)
- Generators: 10-15% (load shedding, backup power)

Base: NEQS 2010 (Noise Standards)

3.3 NOISE MITIGATION
---------------------
Design stage:
- Route alignment: Maximize distance to sensitive receptors (hospitals, schools, residential)
- Depressed alignment: Road below ground level (natural barrier)
- Barriers: Noise walls, earth berms

NOISE BARRIERS:
- Height: Typically 3-6 m (above road surface)
- Materials: Concrete panels, metal (aluminum, steel), transparent (acrylic, polycarbonate)
- Design: Top of barrier should block line-of-sight from road to receptor
- Effectiveness: 5-15 dBA reduction (depending on height, distance)

Cost (Pakistan):
- Concrete barriers: Rs 20,000-30,000 per m² (installed)
- Limited use (expensive, few installations - Lahore Ring Road pilot sections)

SURFACE TREATMENTS:
- Porous asphalt: Open-graded, 3-5 dBA reduction (tire noise absorption)
- Pakistan: Not used (clogging in dusty conditions, monsoon rainfall)

VEGETATION BARRIERS:
- Dense tree planting (5-10 rows, 10-15 m depth)
- Effectiveness: 3-5 dBA reduction (psychological benefit greater than acoustic)
- Common Pakistan (low-cost, co-benefits - air quality, aesthetics)

Construction stage:
- Time restrictions: Daytime only (7 AM - 7 PM), no night work near residential
- Equipment: Use quieter modern equipment, maintain (mufflers, enclosures)
- Shields: Temporary barriers around stationary equipment (generators, compressors)

Pakistan challenges:
- Enforcement weak (night construction common, no penalties)
- Noise monitoring limited (few complaints, cultural acceptance of high noise)

SECTION 4: WATER ENVIRONMENT
================================================================================

4.1 HYDROLOGY AND DRAINAGE
---------------------------
Impacts:
- Increased runoff: Impervious surfaces (pavement) reduce infiltration
- Peak flow increase: 2-5× pre-development (flash flooding risk)

Design considerations:
- Hydraulic structures: Size for 100-year flood (major bridges), 50-year (culverts)
- Freeboard: Minimum 1.0 m above design flood level
- Scour protection: Riprap, aprons (prevent foundation undermining)

Pakistan monsoon flooding:
- 2010 floods: 20% of country inundated, 2,000 km roads damaged
- 2022 floods: 13,000 km roads damaged (Sindh, Balochistan worst affected)
- Climate change: Increased intensity, frequency of extreme events

Base: DMRB LA 113, IRC:5-2015 Section 706

4.2 WATER QUALITY
-----------------
Pollutants:

- Heavy metals: Tire wear (zinc), brake pads (copper), fuel (lead - phased out but legacy contamination)
- Deicing salts: Not applicable Pakistan (minimal snowfall, no routine salting)
- Nutrients: Limited (not agricultural runoff)

Construction phase:
- Sediment loading: High (earthworks, exposed soil)
- Mitigation: Silt fences, sediment basins, stabilization (vegetation, mulch)

Operation phase:
- First flush: Initial storm runoff highest pollutant concentration
- Chronic pollution: Continuous low-level contamination

Pakistan water quality standards (NEQS):
- Discharge into water bodies (rivers, streams):
  - pH: 6.5-8.5
  - Total suspended solids (TSS): <150 mg/L

Base: DMRB LA 113, NEQS 2010 (Water Quality Standards)

4.3 WATER MITIGATION MEASURES
------------------------------
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS):

SWALES (VEGETATED CHANNELS):

- Sizing: 100-year storm volume
- Outlet: Controlled release (match pre-development rates)

WETLANDS (CONSTRUCTED):
- Permanent water + vegetation
- High pollutant removal (sediment settling, plant uptake, biological processes)
- Co-benefits: Biodiversity habitat, aesthetic

INFILTRATION BASINS:
- Recharge groundwater (pervious soils)
- Not suitable Pakistan (many areas clayey soils, low permeability)

OIL/GRIT SEPARATORS:
- Treatment devices (remove sediment, hydrocarbons)
- Required for: Petrol stations, truck stops, high-risk locations

Pakistan practice:
- SuDS rarely used (conventional drainage - pipes, ditches, direct discharge)
- NHA CPEC projects: Some detention basins (flood mitigation)
- Need for capacity building (design, maintenance of SuDS)
