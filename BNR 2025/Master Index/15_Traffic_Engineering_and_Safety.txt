- Placed 1.0-3.0 m before intersection (driver visibility)

Base: IRC:35-2015 Section 3

2.2 TRANSVERSE MARKINGS
-----------------------
ZEBRA CROSSING (PEDESTRIAN CROSSING):
- Black and white stripes (300-400 mm wide, 3-4 m total width)
- Approach zigzag lines (white, 1000 mm wide) - no parking/stopping zone
- Belisha beacons (flashing yellow lights) at both sides

SPEED BREAKER MARKINGS:
- Yellow and black chevrons on hump surface
- Warning sign "SPEED BREAKER" + distance (50 m, 25 m advance)

RUMBLE STRIPS:
- Raised or grooved markings (produce noise/vibration)
- Use: Highway exits, toll plazas, work zones (alert drowsy drivers)

Base: IRC:35-2015 Section 4

2.3 MARKING MATERIALS
---------------------
THERMOPLASTIC:
- Hot-applied (180-220°C), hardens on cooling
- Durability: 3-5 years (high traffic)
- Reflectorization: Glass beads embedded
- Most common Pakistan (cost-effective, durable)

PAINT (CHLORINATED RUBBER):
- Cold-applied, air-drying
- Durability: 6-12 months (requires frequent repainting)
- Economical initial cost
- Used for temporary markings

COLD PLASTIC:
- Two-component (resin + hardener), room temperature application
- Durability: 2-3 years
- More expensive than thermoplastic

PREFORMED TAPE:
- Roll-on application (adhesive-backed)
- Very durable (5-7 years), expensive
- Used for critical locations (intersections, crossings)

Retroreflectivity requirements:
- White markings: ≥150 mcd/m²/lux (new), ≥100 (minimum serviceable)
- Yellow markings: ≥100 mcd/m²/lux (new), ≥70 (minimum)

Pakistan practice:
- Thermoplastic standard (NHA highways)
- Paint still common (urban roads, provincial highways) - cheaper but poor durability

Base: IRC:35-2015 Section 7

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TRAFFIC SIGNALS
================================================================================

3.1 SIGNAL TYPES
----------------
FIXED-TIME SIGNALS:
- Pre-programmed cycle (red, yellow, green durations fixed)
- Simple, suitable for regular traffic patterns
- Cycle time: 40-120 seconds (typical)

VEHICLE-ACTUATED SIGNALS:
- Detectors (induction loops, video) sense vehicle presence
- Adjusts green time based on demand
- Reduces delay on low-volume approaches

AREA TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC):
- Coordinated signal system (multiple intersections)
- Green wave (progressive signal timing, minimize stops)
- Examples: Lahore arterials (Mall Road, Jail Road)

PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS:
- Push-button activated
- Countdown timer (shows remaining green time)
- Audible signals (visually impaired)

Base: IRC:93-1985 Section 3

3.2 SIGNAL DESIGN AND OPERATION
--------------------------------
Signal heads:
- 3-aspect (red, yellow, green) or 4-aspect (+ flashing yellow)
- Lens diameter: 200 mm (urban), 300 mm (high-speed approaches)
- LED preferred (lower power, longer life vs. incandescent)

Mounting height:
- Post-mounted: 3.0-3.5 m above road level
- Overhead: Minimum 5.5 m clearance

Visibility:
- Minimum visibility distance: Stopping sight distance (SSD)
- Sun phantom prevention: Louvers or visors

Phase timing:
- Yellow (amber) duration: 3-5 seconds (based on approach speed)
- All-red clearance: 1-3 seconds (clear intersection)
- Minimum green: 7-10 seconds (pedestrian crossing time)
- Maximum green: 60-90 seconds (avoid excessive delay on other approaches)

Pedestrian crossing time:
- Walking speed: 1.2 m/s (able-bodied), 0.8 m/s (elderly/disabled)
- Minimum green for pedestrians = Crossing distance / Walking speed + 4 sec

Example: 12 m road width
- Time = 12 m / 1.2 m/s + 4 = 14 seconds minimum green

Base: IRC:93-1985 Sections 5-6

3.3 PAKISTAN SIGNAL CHALLENGES
-------------------------------
Issues:
- Signal violations: Red-light running common (50%+ compliance failure)
- Power outages: Load shedding disrupts signals (battery backup often missing)
- Maintenance: Many signals non-functional (30-40% in some cities)
- Pedestrian behavior: Crossing against signals, jaywalking

Solutions:
- Red-light cameras: Automated enforcement (installed Lahore, Islamabad limited locations)
- Solar-powered signals: Pilot projects (Multan, Faisalabad)
- Countdown timers: Improve compliance (drivers know remaining time)

SECTION 4: ROAD SAFETY MEASURES
================================================================================

4.1 SPEED MANAGEMENT
--------------------
SPEED LIMITS:

Urban areas:
- Residential: 30-40 km/h
- Commercial: 40-50 km/h
- Arterial: 50-60 km/h

Rural highways:
- Single carriageway: 80-100 km/h
- Dual carriageway: 100-110 km/h
- Motorways: 120 km/h (cars), 90 km/h (trucks/buses)

School zones:
- 30 km/h (during school hours)
- Flashing beacons, pavement markings

SPEED CALMING MEASURES:

Speed breakers/humps:
- Height: 75-100 mm (roads <50 km/h)
- Width: 3.7 m (gradual), 0.9 m (abrupt - avoid, uncomfortable)
- Spacing: 80-120 m (residential areas)
- Warning signs: "SLOW - SPEED BREAKER" (50 m, 25 m advance)

Rumble strips:
- Raised strips (10-15 mm height, 300 mm spacing)
- Centerline or shoulder (prevent run-off-road, head-on)

Chicanes:
- Horizontal deflection (S-curves)
- Reduce speed through narrowing, curvilinear path

Road narrowing:
- Chokers (pinch points at intervals)
- Creates perception of constriction, lower speeds

Pakistan practice:
- Speed breakers overused (every 200-500 m some areas)
- Often excessive height (150+ mm) - vehicle damage, discomfort
- Lack of proper design/warning (accidents, especially motorcycles at night)

Base: IRC:99-2018 Section 8.5

4.2 PEDESTRIAN SAFETY
----------------------
FACILITIES:

Footpaths:
- Minimum width: 1.5 m (clear), 2.0 m (high pedestrian volume)
- Surface: Paved, slip-resistant, accessible (≤2% cross-slope)
- Separation from carriageway: Kerb (150 mm height)

Pedestrian crossings:
- Zebra crossings: Uncontrolled (low traffic, <800 veh/hour)
- Pelican crossings: Signal-controlled, push-button
- Refuge islands: For wide roads (>14 m), mid-road waiting area

Grade-separated crossings:
- Footbridges: Stairs + ramp (accessibility)
- Subways/underpasses: Require lighting, security, drainage

Pakistan challenges:
- Footpaths absent or encroached (vendors, parked motorcycles)
- Pedestrians walk on carriageway (high risk)
- Footbridges underutilized (pedestrians prefer jaywalking - faster, less effort)

Safety improvements:
- Fencing along roadside (channel pedestrians to crossings)
- Pedestrian countdown signals (Pakistan cities implementing)
- Enforcement: Penalties for jaywalking (rarely enforced currently)

Base: IRC:103-2012 (Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities)

4.3 VULNERABLE ROAD USERS
--------------------------
MOTORCYCLISTS (60% of Pakistan vehicle fleet):
- Helmet laws: Mandatory 1995, compliance 15%
- Fatalities: 50% of road deaths are motorcyclists
- Issues: No protective gear, overloading (3-4 persons), unsafe maneuvers

Safety measures:
- Dedicated motorcycle lanes (Islamabad Expressway pilot)
- Helmet enforcement campaigns (increased fines)
- Awareness: Defensive riding courses

BICYCLISTS:
- Dedicated cycle tracks: 1.5 m wide (one-way), 2.5 m (two-way)
- Shared paths: Segregated from pedestrians (pavement markings)
- Lahore cycle track network: 50 km planned (limited implementation)

CHILDREN:
- School zones: 30 km/h speed limit, flashing beacons, crossings
- School Safety Patrols: Student volunteers assist crossing (effective in some schools)

ELDERLY/DISABLED:
- Longer crossing times at signals
- Accessible infrastructure (ramps, tactile paving)
