Skidding resistance
(formerly HD 28/15)
Revision 2
Summary
This document describes the requirements for the provision and management of appropriate
levels of skid resistance on UK motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. It describes the
requirements for making and interpreting measurements of skid resistance. It also provides a
method to identify locations for treatment to improve skid resistance where that treatment is likely
to reduce the risk of skidding related incidents in wet conditions. This document is complemented
by DMRB document HD 36/15, which sets out the requirements and associated advice on
surfacing material characteristics necessary to deliver the required skid resistance properties.
Application by Overseeing Organisations
Any specific requirements for Overseeing Organisations alternative or supplementary to those given in this document
are given in National Application Annexes to this document.

CS 228 Revision 2
Introduction
Introduction
Background
In this document, the term "skid resistance" refers to the frictional properties of the road surface in wet
conditions. The skid resistance of a wet or damp road surface can be substantially lower than the same
surface when dry, and is more dependent on the condition of the surfacing material. It should also be
noted that there is no boundary at which the skid resistance passes from being "safe" to being
"dangerous".
To achieve consistency, skid resistance is measured using a specified device, under standardised
conditions. These measurements are used to characterise the road surface and assess the need for
maintenance, but cannot be related directly to the friction available to a road user making a particular
manoeuvre at a particular time.
The objectives of this document are to:
1) maintain a consistent approach to the provision of skid resistance across the Overseeing
Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, so that road users find appropriate friction
characteristics when accelerating, braking and cornering;
2) provide a level of skid resistance appropriate to the nature of the road environment at each location.
The appropriate level is determined from a combination of: network-wide analyses of crash history,
consideration of friction demands by road users and local judgement of site-specific factors.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 3.N].

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document provides details of the requirements that shall be used to determine appropriate levels
of skid resistance on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads.
NOTE
This document is not applicable to footways and cycleways that are not subject to regular trafficking by
heavy vehicles.
1.1.1
Footways and cycle-ways designed and constructed in accordance with CD 239 [Ref 2.N] should
provide appropriate skidding/slip resistance for the lifetime of the surfacing provided that routine
maintenance activities are undertaken in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's requirements.
1.2
This document lays down the procedure that shall be used for measuring the skid resistance and, for
cases where the measured skid resistance is at or below a predetermined level, provides a
methodology to assist the engineer in assessing the requirement for remedial works.
1.2.1
Remedial works may be subject to an economic assessment of the costs and benefits before
proceeding, to promote the best use of maintenance budgets.
NOTE
Skid resistance surveys can sometimes be carried out for special purposes, such as research or local
investigations. Due to the different test procedures, these measurements require careful interpretation.
The data from such surveys do not form part of this document.
1.3
This document shall not be used for the identification of locations or routes where road safety
engineering measures could be beneficial to reduce crashes.
NOTE
In this document, the provision of appropriate levels of skid resistance is treated primarily as an asset
management issue rather than one of road safety engineering, although the crash risk is assessed in
order to determine an appropriate level of skid resistance for each site.
Implementation
1.4
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving new construction, improvement
or maintenance on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to
the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 3.N].
Use of GG 101
1.5
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Operation
NOTE
The CSC is an estimate of the underlying skid resistance once the effect of seasonal variation has
been taken into account. This value can be taken to represent the degree to which the road surface
has become polished under the action of traffic.
2.3
On receipt of processed survey data, the CSC values shall be compared with the predetermined
Investigatory Levels (ILs), to identify lengths of road where the skid resistance is at or below the
Investigatory Level.
NOTE
Investigatory Levels represent a limit, above which the skid resistance is considered to be satisfactory
but at or below which the road is judged to require an investigation of the skid resistance requirements.
Site categories are assigned based on broad features of the road type and geometry plus specific
features of the individual site. Investigatory Levels are assigned according to the perceived level of risk
within each site category. Investigatory Levels can be reviewed on a rolling programme, to ensure that
changes in the network are identified, local experience is applied and consistency is achieved. The
process for setting Investigatory Levels and the normal range of Investigatory Levels for each site
category are described in Section 4.
2.4
Wherever the CSC is at or below the assigned Investigatory Level an investigation shall be carried out
to determine whether treatment to improve the skid resistance is required or whether some other action
is required.
NOTE
The investigation process is described in Sections 5 and 6. The decision on whether treatment is
necessary is unlikely to be clear-cut, but requires professional engineering judgement taking into
account local experience, the nature of the site, the condition of the road surfacing and the crash
history for the previous three years.
2.4.1
If successive investigations show that treatment is not warranted at the current level of skid resistance
then the Investigatory Level may be lowered (within the constraints of Table 4.2 and sub-clause 4.2.3 of
this document).
NOTE
The processes of setting Investigatory Levels and undertaking investigations are complementary, since
local knowledge and experience gained through conducting detailed investigations can be used to
refine the criteria for setting Investigatory Levels for similar types of site.
2.5
The priority for treatment for those lengths where an improvement in skid resistance is being
recommended shall be established through the Overseeing Organisation's process for prioritising
maintenance.

3. Measurement of skid resistance
4) process survey data;
5) check survey coverage;
6) apply seasonal correction.
NOTE 2
The steps are detailed in turn below.
Determine the survey procedure
3.2
The basis of this document is that the overall (summer) level of skid resistance shall be assessed
rather than using a single measurement. This overall level of skid resistance is referred to as the
Characteristic Skid Coefficient (CSC).
NOTE 1
The skid resistance of road surfaces can fluctuate within a year and between successive years, while
maintaining a similar general level over a longer period of time. By smoothing these fluctuations
caused by seasonal effects, sites exhibiting lower skid resistance can be identified more accurately.
NOTE 2
The way in which surveys are planned and how seasonal variation is accounted for is provided in the
National Application Annexes for each Overseeing Organisation.
3.3
Prior to the survey season, the network to be surveyed, the survey period, the test lane, the survey
strategy and the method and/or the accuracy of location referencing required shall be established with
the agreement of the Overseeing Organisation.
3.4
Measurements for monitoring the in-service skid resistance of motorway and all-purpose trunk roads
shall be made with a sideway-force coefficient routine investigation machine that has been accredited
by the Overseeing Organisation for use on its network and not with other skid resistance measurement
devices.
NOTE
Various types of equipment are available for measuring skid resistance. Work has been carried out that
has produced some correlations between devices. However, these equations are not robust enough to
allow the machines to operate interchangeably.
Plan surveys
3.5
The survey provider shall plan the survey routes.
3.6
Surveys shall be planned so that they will occur during the required survey period (early, middle or late)
to allow for the determination of CSC values.
3.7
These survey periods shall be defined so that the low point in the summer occurs during the middle
period, as shown in Figure 3.7.
Figure 3.7 Survey periods
3.8
The dates for the survey periods can differ for different geographic regions and shall be defined by the
Overseeing Organisation.

periods. This can only be done if the general weather conditions in the area remain unchanged and if
no frosts or treatments to the road, such as gritting, have occurred.
Conduct surveys
3.9
Survey contractors shall comply with the calibration and quality assurance detailed in British Standard
BS 7941-1 [Ref 4.N] and the "Accreditation and Quality Assurance of Sideway-Force Skid Resistance
Survey Devices" document available on the UK Roads Liaison Group (UKRLG) website AQA SFD
2016 [Ref 1.N].
3.10
In each direction of travel, the lane carrying the greatest number of heavy vehicles shall be tested.
NOTE
For most roads, this will be the leftmost permanent lane.
3.10.1
Additional lanes, including the hard shoulder for sections where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic,
may be surveyed only if required by the Overseeing Organisation.
3.11
If it is necessary for the machine to deviate from the test line (e.g. to avoid a physical obstruction or
surface contamination such as mud, oil, grit etc.) the data shall be marked as invalid and subsequently
discarded.
3.11.1
Where it is necessary for the machine to deviate from the test line, the invalid length should be
resurveyed at a later date but still within the required survey period.
3.12
For the testing of roundabouts, after entering a roundabout a minimum of one complete circuit shall be
tested.
NOTE
Ensuring that a complete circuit is surveyed can require the machine to complete more than one
revolution of the roundabout.
3.12.1
Where safe to do so, the preferred test line on roundabouts should be the outermost lane.
3.12.2
On multiple lane roundabouts with lane markings for different routes, it may be necessary to test an
alternative lane to avoid conflict with other traffic.
NOTE
Roundabouts can present practical problems regarding potential traffic conflicts and testing speed.
They range from small, mini-roundabouts to large grade-separated interchanges. Larger roundabouts
can have free-flowing traffic or traffic light controls at certain times of day.
3.13
Mini roundabouts and small island roundabouts that are physically too small to test as above shall be
tested as part of the main carriageway and do not need to be tested separately.
3.14
Measurements shall not be undertaken where the air temperature is below 5°C.
3.15
Testing shall be avoided in heavy rainfall or where there is standing water on the road surface.
NOTE
Excess water on the surface can affect the drag forces at the tyre/road interface and influence the
measurements.
3.16
Where the posted speed limit is greater than 50mph, the target survey speed shall be 80km/h.
3.17
On all other roads, the target survey speed shall be 50km/h.
3.18
The machine driver shall maintain a vehicle speed as close to the target survey speed as possible.
3.19
The survey operator shall maintain a record of weather conditions that could influence the survey
results, such as heavy rainfall or strong winds.
Process survey data
3.20
On completion of the survey, the survey data shall be loaded into the Overseeing Organisation's
information management systems and aligned to the road network.
3.21
Readings for each 10m sub-section collected within the speed range 25 to 85km/h shall be corrected to
a speed of 50km/h using the following equation:

defined further in BS 7941-1 [Ref 4.N].
3.22
Temperature correction shall not be applied.
3.23
SC values shall be calculated for each 10m sub-section for which a valid SR(s) value is available using
the following equation:

Check survey coverage
3.24
The survey machine operator shall produce a survey coverage report detailing the network that was to
be surveyed, lengths with missing or invalid data, and an explanation for the missing or invalid data.
Apply seasonal correction
3.25
Once the data have been loaded and checked, the seasonally corrected CSC values shall be
determined from the SC values following the method appropriate to the survey strategy, as described in
the National Application Annexes.

Allocate site category and investigatory level
4.2
An investigatory level (IL) shall be assigned for every part of the network, by determining the most
appropriate site category for each location and then selecting an appropriate IL from the range
indicated in Table 4.2 for that site category.

NOTE 1
Sites with the same site category can have different levels of risk of skidding crashes. There is
therefore the flexibility to set different ILs for different sites within the same category.
NOTE 2
This allows sites where the risk of skidding crashes is potentially higher to have a higher IL and
possibly be treated to maintain a higher level of skid resistance.
NOTE 3
The objective of setting an IL is to assign a level of skid resistance appropriate for the risk on the site, at
or below which further investigation is required to evaluate the site specific risks in more detail.

CS 228 Revision 2
4. Setting the investigatory level
NOTE 4
Advice for selecting an appropriate IL is provided in Appendix A. The range of ILs for each site category
has been developed as a result of UK research studies on motorway and all-purpose trunk roads and
reflects the variation in crash risk within a site category.
4.2.1
'ST' in cells within Table 4.2 indicates the range of ILs that should generally be used for roads carrying
significant levels of traffic.
4.2.2
'LR' in cells indicates a lower IL that may be appropriate in lower risk situations, such as low traffic
levels or where the risks present are mitigated by other means, providing this has been confirmed by
the crash history.
4.2.3
Exceptionally, an IL higher or lower than those indicated in Table 4.2 may be assigned if justified by the
observed crash record and local risk assessment.
4.3
If more than one site category is appropriate then the site category with the highest recommended IL
shall be selected.
4.4
If the highest recommended IL for the site categories are the same then the category highest up the
table shall be selected (A being the highest on the table and S2 the lowest).
4.5
ILs for site categories Q and K shall be based on the 50m approach to the feature and, in the case of
approach to junctions, through to the extent of the junction.
4.5.1
The approach length may be extended when justified by local site characteristics.
4.6
Categories G1 and G2 shall not be applied to uphill gradients on carriageways with one-way traffic.
4.7
Category S1 shall be applied to all bends on carriageways with one-way traffic where the radius of
curvature is <100m.
4.8
Category S2 shall be applied to all bends on carriageways with two-way traffic where the radius of
curvature is <100m.
4.9
Category S1 shall be applied to bends on carriageways with one-way traffic with a radius of curvature ≥
100m but <500m where the speed limit is ≥50mph.
4.10
Category S2 shall be applied to bends on carriageways with two-way traffic with a radius of curvature ≥
100m but <500m where the speed limit is ≥50mph.
4.11
The site category and IL applied to a length shall be applied to all lanes of the carriageway that have
traffic running in the same direction.
4.11.1
All lanes of the carriageway (with the same direction of traffic) should be included when identifying what
site category and IL will be applied. This includes the hard shoulder where hard shoulder running is
implemented.
4.12
The site category and IL information shall be recorded together with the date of assessment.
Identify sections for review
4.13
A review of the IL shall be carried out when a significant change to the network is made, for example
changes to the road layout.
4.14
A procedure shall be put in place for reviewing the IL at least every three years.
NOTE
The review of the IL can be done by reviewing one third of the network each year or all of the network
every three years.
4.15
Lengths with missing IL data, or where the IL lies outside the range specified in Table 4.2, shall be
included in each review.
Record updated ILs and review date
4.16
The sections reviewed shall be recorded, together with the review date and any changes to the site
categories and ILs.

======================================================================
CS 228 Revision 2
5. Initial investigation
NOTE
The process is split into the following steps.
1) identify sites at or below the IL;
2) identify other sites requiring investigation;
3) data validation;
4) identify sites for detailed investigation.
5.2
All sites where the measured CSC is at or below the IL shall be investigated.
NOTE
The objective is to determine whether a surface treatment is justified to reduce the risk of vehicles
skidding, whether some other form of action is required, or whether no action is currently required. If no
action is taken, sites will automatically be reviewed again following the next skid resistance
measurement if they remain at or below the IL.
5.3
The investigation shall be undertaken in two stages: an initial investigation, described in this section, to
check the data and assess the need for a detailed investigation and, secondly, a detailed investigation
to assess the justification and priority for treatment, which is described in Section 6.
Identify sites at or below the IL
5.4
The CSC value, calculated for the appropriate averaging length, shall be compared against the IL.
NOTE
The appropriate averaging length is normally 100m or the length of a feature if it is shorter, except for
roundabouts, where the averaging length is 10m.
5.5
The averaging length shall be truncated on any change of site category or IL.
5.5.1
Consequently, the averaging length will be shorter where the site category is less than 100m long or at
the end of a site category longer than 100m. Residual lengths less than 50% of a complete averaging
length may be appended to the penultimate length, if both the lengths have the same site category and
IL.
NOTE
If the skid resistance is close to the IL, successive 10m or 100m lengths can fall alternately above and
below the IL. These lengths can be combined into a single site for investigation. The longer lengths are
also more robust for crash analysis. Subsequent detailed investigations can show that only part of this
length would require treatment.
Identify other sites requiring investigation
5.6
An investigation shall also be carried out if, as a result of processes separate from those detailed in this
document, sites are identified where increased wet or skidding crash levels have been observed.
5.6.1
Examples of the processes referred to in clause 5.6 may include annual safety reports, police
complaints, Managing Organisation observations and damage to roadside furniture.
Data validation
5.7
Basic data validation checks shall be conducted for sites that have been identified as at or below the IL,
including confirmation that the IL has been assigned correctly in accordance with current guidance and
that the skid resistance recorded is within the normal range expected.
5.8
If the IL is incorrect then it shall be updated and recorded together with the date of the change.
5.8.1
If the skid resistance is above the revised IL then further investigation is unnecessary and the change
of IL should be recorded as the outcome of the investigation.
Identify sites for detailed investigation
5.9
Sites at or below IL requiring detailed investigation shall be identified based on the site category, IL,
current skid resistance and observed crash history.
NOTE
Further details of how to identify sites requiring detailed investigation are provided in the National
Application Annexes.

2) plan investigations;
3) carry out investigations;
4) Prioritise and programme maintenance.
Collate data
6.2
The data collected at the start of a detailed investigation shall include skid resistance, texture depth and
the most recent three years of crash data available.
NOTE
For new construction or changes in layout, three years of relevant crash data are likely to not be
available.
6.2.1
In cases where three years of crash data are not available, data since the date of construction or
change in layout should be used.
6.3
Skid resistance data at 10m intervals shall be obtained for bends and roundabouts.
NOTE
Short lengths with low skid resistance could be hazardous for vehicles cornering and can be disguised
by averaging over a longer length.
6.3.1
Skid resistance data at 10m intervals should also be obtained if the condition of the surfacing material
is known to be variable over local areas.
6.3.2
If the site has poor transverse or longitudinal evenness, or bends or gradients, data for these features
should be obtained.
NOTE
In some instances these data can assist in checking whether the site category and/or Investigatory
Level are correct or need amending.
6.3.3
Information on the date of the last surface treatment may also be relevant to the investigation and the
interpretation of collision data.
6.4
For each site, the relevant data shall be collated to show the location of lengths with poor surface
condition relative to the location of previous crashes and features such as bends and junctions.
6.4.1
This relevant data may be collated as strip maps, GIS mapping or spreadsheets.
6.4.2
The location of crashes occurring in wet conditions, irrespective of whether skidding was reported,
should be identified specifically.
6.4.3
Given the limited accuracy of locating accident positions, it may be assumed for the purpose of the
detailed investigation that the position of a crash coincides with the location of poor surface condition if
it occurred within 200m.
6.5
The overall crash risk shall be calculated for the site for comparison with control data.
6.5.1
The crash risk should be calculated as the total number of crashes per 108vehicle-km, if traffic data are
available, or otherwise as the total number of crashes per year, per 100 km.
6.6
For this calculation the choice of whether to use carriageway length or route length, and the choice of
units (km or miles) shall be consistent with the method used for the calculation of control data.
Plan investigations
6.7
Greater priority shall be given to completing investigations for sites that are substantially below the IL or
where the crash history indicates that there is a risk of wet skidding crashes occurring.
6.7.1
Investigations should be planned primarily to maximise efficiency.
6.7.2
A physical visit to the site should be made.
NOTE
Different investigation methods can be used, with differing advantages:
1) on foot (this allows the condition of the road to be observed in detail);

CS 228 Revision 2
6. Detailed site investigation and prioritisatio...
2) from a parked or moving vehicle (this allows the pattern of traffic movement and speed to be
observed during the visit);
3) from recent local knowledge of the site (this can provide a more general knowledge of the road
usage under a wider range of traffic, weather and lighting conditions);
4) from video records and maps. Maps cannot be used in isolation as they do not show obstructions to
visibility, drainage issues, field accesses, hidden dips, etc.
Carry out site investigations
6.8
Site investigations shall determine whether treatment to improve the skid resistance is required or
whether some other action, including no action, is required.
6.8.1
The full carriageway width should be included in the investigation, that is all lanes of a dual carriageway
and both directions of a single carriageway.
NOTE 1
Skid resistance and texture depth are generally measured in the nearside wheel track in lane one. If,
during a site investigation, the rest of the pavement is not visually consistent then it is possible that the
skid resistance of the rest of the lane or other lanes can be lower than the line tested.
NOTE 2
Guidance for the assessment of texture depth is given in CS 230 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 3
If a site contains a sharp bend to the left in combination with traffic braking or accelerating then the
offside wheel path can become more polished and the CSC can be up to 0.05 units lower than in the
nearside wheel path.
6.8.2
If the pavement is not visually consistent, it may be necessary to carry out additional surveys to
investigate potential variations in skid resistance.
6.8.3
All junction approaches within the site should also be investigated to determine whether the advance
signing/alignment is appropriate or could be improved.
6.8.4
The investigation should determine if the skid resistance is likely to be representative for the site.
6.8.5
In particular very low values of skid resistance should be viewed with caution.
NOTE
Localised reduction in the skid resistance can be caused by contamination or by flushing of the binder
to the surface. Alternatively, it is possible that there has been an error in the survey. In this case, the
data can be compared to data measured in previous years and also with adjacent lengths with the
same surfacing material, to determine if the skid resistance is representative of the condition of the
surfacing material.
6.9
If it is determined that the reduction in skid resistance is temporary and not representative for the site,
then this shall be recorded with reasons.
6.9.1
Further investigation is not needed at determination that the reduction in skid resistance is temporary
and not representative for the site time, but if subsequent surveys continue to appear unrepresentative
then the causes should be investigated.
6.10
As a result of the detailed site investigation, a clear recommendation shall be recorded of the actions to
be taken (including if no immediate action is required).
NOTE
An example template of a site investigation form is given in Appendix B.
6.10.1
Treatment to improve the skid resistance should be recommended if, taking into account the nature of
the site and the observed crash history, it is likely to reduce the risk of crashes in wet conditions.
NOTE
Based on knowledge of skid resistance and crash risk trends, sites that can be recommended for
treatment include locations where the position of crashes in wet conditions (whether or not skidding
was reported) appears to be linked to surface condition, or where the overall crash risk is higher than
average when compared with suitable control data.
6.10.2
The Overseeing Organisation may be referred to for the provision of appropriate control data for the
purpose of making this assessment.

CS 228 Revision 2
6. Detailed site investigation and prioritisatio...
6.10.3
For sites where neither of the above conditions apply (see sub-clause 6.10.1), treatment should be
recommended if the skid resistance, combined with the nature of the individual site, suggest that the
observed crash count underestimates the actual level of risk.
NOTE
In such cases, preventive treatment can be justified to pre-empt a potential increase in crashes.
6.10.4
If treatment is only required on part of the site then those lengths should be clearly identified.
6.11
If the site investigation identifies any characteristic of the site or road-user behaviour that suggests other
road safety engineering measures could be appropriate, then persons with relevant local experience,
such as the person locally responsible for crash investigation and prevention, shall be notified.
6.12
If the site investigation identifies requirements for additional routine highway maintenance, such as
sweeping, renewal of markings etc. then persons with relevant local experience, such as the person
locally responsible for routine maintenance shall be notified.
6.13
If there is no justification for treatment then no further action shall be required.
NOTE
If the site remains below the Investigatory Level after the next measurement of skid resistance then it
will automatically become subject to a further investigation.
6.13.1
If the skid resistance and crash pattern of a site at or below the IL have remained stable for more than
three years, then the IL may be lowered by 0.05 units CSC providing it remains within the range of ILs
specified in Table 4.2.
6.14
The results of the detailed site investigation shall be documented and retained together with the identity
of the assessor and other parties consulted.
Maintenance prioritisation and programming
6.15
Budgeting and programming issues will influence when the treatments are carried out and this process
shall be managed through the Overseeing Organisation's process for prioritising maintenance.

Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investigatory Levels
A1
Overview
This Appendix provides detailed guidance on the selection of appropriate site categories and ILs from
the range in Table 4.2. These are then followed by some examples. Where appropriate, supplementary
guidance is provided within the relevant National Application Annex.
Lengths with no specific risk of skidding crashes should be assigned the lowest IL with 'ST' cell
indication from the appropriate site category. Where identified risks exist, a higher IL should be
selected from within the range. The guidance given in this section is not exhaustive and therefore
judgement of the risks specific to each location should be exercised.
Additional information, such as safety reports and congestion reports may be useful when setting site
categories and the IL. They may be used to help identify higher risk situations and where queuing is
likely.
A2
Category A: Motorway
This site category should be used for all sections of main carriageway that meet motorway standards of
geometric design, including merging and diverging areas of the carriageway. Motorway slips roads
should not have category A applied but instead should have category B (or the appropriate event
category) applied.
If the motorway length under consideration does not meet motorway standards of geometric design
then the length should be treated as a carriageway with one-way traffic (either event or non-event
depending on the situation).
An IL of 0.35 should be appropriate in almost all circumstances.
The IL can be changed to 0.30 in exceptional cases if, following a detailed site investigation, it is clear
that the crash risk associated with a skid resistance below 0.35 is low.
A3
Category B: Non-event carriageway with one-way traffic
This site category should be used for all non-motorway dual carriageways and other lengths with
one-way traffic, including motorway slip roads. Note that other events on lengths with one-way traffic,
such as approaches to roundabouts/junctions, bends or gradients should be considered and
categorised accordingly.
At junctions, category B should be used for areas where traffic merges or diverges if:
1) the junction layout allows traffic leaving or joining the mainline to match the speed of the mainline
traffic; and
2) there is adequate taper length for merging to occur.
For category B an IL of 0.35 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL can be reduced to 0.30 only following a detailed site investigation and it is clear that the crash
risk associated with a skid resistance below 0.35 is low.
The IL should be increased to 0.40 for:
1) areas where pedestrians or other vulnerable road users are common but category K is not
appropriate;
2) hazards where the speed limit is 50mph or above and where category Q is not appropriate, including:
a) junctions where the geometry does not justify using category Q;
b) bus stops, laybys, etc;
c) other accesses, e.g. private roads/drives, depending on the volume of traffic and vehicle types
using the access;

Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
3) bends on roads with a radius >100m and a speed limit below 50mph if they present a particular
hazard in spite of the lower speed;
4) uphill sections that give rise to a speed differential between vehicles that could result in increased
risk;
5) the approach to the end of a dual carriageway where a lane drop occurs.
A4
Category C: Non-event carriageway with two-way traffic
This site category should be used for all non-event carriageway sections with two-way traffic.
At junctions, category C should be used for areas where traffic merges or diverges if:
1) the junction layout allows traffic leaving or joining the mainline to match the speed of the mainline
traffic; and
2) there is adequate taper length for merging to occur without the mainline being forced into avoiding
action.
An IL of 0.40 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL can be reduced to 0.35 following a detailed site investigation.
The IL should be increased to 0.45 for:
1) areas where pedestrians or other vulnerable road users are common but category K is not
appropriate;
2) hazards where the speed limit is 50mph or above (over the braking area) and where category Q is
not appropriate, including:
a) junctions where the geometry does not justify using category Q;
b) bus stops, lay-bys, etc;
c) other accesses, e.g. private roads, depending on the volume of traffic and vehicle types using
the access;
3) bends on roads with a radius >100m and a speed limit below 50mph if they present a particular
hazard in spite of the lower speed;
4) uphill sections that give rise to a speed differential between vehicles that could result in increased
risk, but category G1 or G2 is not appropriate.
A5
Category Q: Approaches to and across minor and major junctions, approaches
to roundabouts and traffic signals
This site category should be used for:
1) major / minor priority junctions;
2) other significant accesses;
3) approaches to roundabouts and traffic signals (except for high risk circumstances such as
pedestrian crossings etc.).
If the junction design and traffic volume allows the traffic to merge with / diverge from the mainline traffic
without changing speed, this site category should not be used (use category B or C instead).
A5.1
Approaches to junctions:
For the purposes of this document, roads involved in a junction are split into two types, the major road
and the minor road(s). The major road is the road where traffic has permanent priority. The minor
road(s) are where traffic is required to give way.
Drivers on the major road have permanent priority and are not expecting to give way, but may have to
brake sharply if a vehicle emerges unexpectedly from the minor road or turns right across their path.
Factors to consider are:

CS 228 Revision 2
Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
1) right turning vehicles from a minor road are at risk of a side impact with traffic on the major road, and
the outcome of this type of crash is likely to be severe;
2) the risks increase where the speed of traffic joining or leaving the main carriageway differs greatly
from those continuing straight on. This is heavily influenced by the taper length, provision of
dedicated lanes for right-turning traffic, etc.
On the minor road, the risk of having to brake unexpectedly is lower since the need to give way is
indicated clearly in advance of the junction.
On the major road site category Q should be applied to the 50m approach (in the direction of travel) to
the junction and across the extent of the junction. For roads with a speed limit of 50mph or above,
consider extending the approach distance, depending on the risk of traffic having to brake unexpectedly.
For major roads with two-way traffic, consider the two directions separately to determine the overall
extent of the site category. The two directions should be assigned the site category and IL
independently so that site category Q is not applied on the length following a junction.
For major roads, an IL of 0.45 should be used if:
1) the speed limit is below 50mph;
2) the speed limit is 50mph or above but the traffic volume and speed differential between the major
and minor traffic streams results in an acceptably low risk.
For major roads, an IL of 0.50 should be used if the speed limit is 50mph or above and:
1) the combination of speed differential and traffic volume result in a moderate level of risk;
2) sight lines on the minor road are poor, leading to the possibility of driver error;
3) right-turning traffic from the major road is not adequately catered for;
4) high levels of traffic on the mainline may induce drivers joining it to take risks when pulling out.
For major roads, an IL of 0.55 should be used only in exceptional circumstances where the risk is high.
Consider whether the high risk could be mitigated more appropriately by other means.
On the minor road, site category Q should be applied to the 50m approach to the stop/give way line.
Extend the distance, if necessary, to take into account likely queues.
For minor roads, an IL of 0.45 should be used in most circumstances.
The IL should be increased for minor roads to 0.50 if the sight lines (on the minor road) approaching the
junction are poor, leading to the possibility of a driver having to brake suddenly.
Where the volume of traffic using the access warrants it, other significant accesses (petrol stations,
superstores etc.) should be treated as for major/minor priority junctions, above. If the volume of traffic
is low, use the appropriate non-event categories instead.
A5.2
Approaches to roundabouts and traffic signals:
Site category Q should be applied to the 50m approach to the stop/give-way line. Extend the distance,
as necessary, to take into account likely regular queuing.
This site category should not be used for signal-controlled pedestrian crossings or for other high risk
situations. Category K should be used instead.
An IL of 0.45 should be used if the speed limit is below 50mph, or if there is a higher speed limit but
actual traffic speeds are low, e.g. because the road layout does not lend itself to higher speed.
An IL of 0.50 should be used if the speed limit is 50mph or above unless actual traffic speeds are low.
An IL of 0.55 should be used only in exceptional circumstances where the risk is high. Consider
whether the high risk could be mitigated more appropriately by other means.

CS 228 Revision 2
Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
A6
Category K: Approaches to pedestrian crossings and other high risk situations
Site category K should be applied where the consequences of a crash are likely to be severe, including:
1) signal controlled pedestrian crossings and zebra crossings;
2) railway crossings;
3) other situations where there is both a likelihood of vulnerable users in the road and a high risk of
injury in the event of a crash.
Site category K should be applied for the 50m approach to the event. Consider extending this distance
for roads with speed limits of 50mph or above, depending on the likelihood of traffic having to brake
unexpectedly.
An IL of 0.50 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL should be increased to 0.55 where there is reason to believe pedestrians or other vulnerable
road users may misjudge the speed of oncoming traffic, such situations include:
1) near schools or other facilities for children;
2) near public houses;
3) where the speed of approaching traffic is high.
A7
Category R: Roundabout
Site category R should be used for roundabout circulation areas, including approaches to traffic lights
on roundabouts. If there are specific, high-risk situations then category K should be used. Mini
roundabouts should be excluded from this site category; in this instance category Q should be applied
to the approach and across the mini-roundabout.
An IL of 0.45 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL should be increased to 0.50 under the following circumstances:
1) high speed of circulating traffic;
2) high incidence of cyclists or motorcyclists;
3) absence of signalised control on roundabouts at grade separated interchanges.
A8
Category G1: Gradient 5-10% longer than 50m
Site category G1 should be used on carriageways with two-way traffic, for lengths of at least 50m with
an average uphill or downhill gradient of between 5 and 10%.
Site category G1 should be used on carriageways with one-way traffic, for lengths of at least 50m with
an average downhill gradient of between 5 and 10%.
This assessment may be based on 10m gradient data from traffic-speed surveys or from accurate
topographical survey data when available.
An IL of 0.45 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL should be raised to 0.50 if there are other risk factors also present such as poor visibility etc.
A9
Category G2: Gradient >10% longer than 50m
Site category G2 should be used on carriageways with two-way traffic, for lengths of at least 50m with
an average uphill or downhill gradient greater than 10%.
Site category G2 should be used on carriageways with one-way traffic, for lengths of at least 50m with
an average downhill gradient of 10% of higher.
This assessment may be based on 10m gradient data from traffic-speed surveys or from accurate
topographical survey data when available

Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
An IL of 0.50 should be appropriate in most circumstances.
The IL can be reduced to 0.45 only after a detailed site investigation.
The IL should be raised to 0.55 if there are other risk factors also present such as poor visibility etc.
A10
Category S1/S2: Bend radius < 500m
This Site category should be used for bends on carriageways with one-way traffic (category S1) and on
carriageways with two-way traffic (category S2).
For bends with radii between 100m and 500m the S1 and S2 categories should only be applied where
the speed limit is 50mph or above. For roads with lower speed limits, use the non-event site category B
or C. For bends that have radii less than 100m, S1 and S2 should apply at all speeds.
This category should not generally be used for:
1) short lengths, for example less than 100m, with a radius of curvature between 250m and 500m;
2) roundabout exits.
The site category should be extended upstream and downstream to where the radius of the road has
exceeded 500m or 100m for bend radii where S1 or S2 is used at speeds lower than 50mph.
The lower, cells with 'ST' indication for each category should be appropriate in most circumstances (IL
of 0.45 for category S1, or 0.50 for category S2).
The IL should be raised if there are other risk factors also present (IL of 0.50 for category S1, or 0.55
for category S2), or particular potential for loss of control, including if:
1) the geometry of the bend is particularly hazardous, taking into account the traffic speed;
2) adverse camber is present.
For category S2, the IL can be reduced to 0.45 only after a detailed site investigation.
This assessment may be based on 10m curvature data from traffic-speed surveys, drawings or from
accurate topographical survey data when available.

Examples
A11.1
Example: Motorway grade separated junction
For generic motorway grade separated junctions there are four different site categories in effect, as
described below and shown in Figure A.1. In some cases other site categories may also be required
due to other events occurring in the vicinity.

Figure A.1 Site categories for a typical motorway grade separated junction layout
The main carriageway should have category A applied to its whole length (if appropriate to its
geometry/layout). The off slip should have category B applied for the majority of its length with category
Q applied to the last 50m (length of Q to be extended if queues likely).The on slip should have category
B applied to its whole length unless other events for the site take precedence (e.g. high gradient or tight
bend). The roundabout should have category R applied to its whole length.
A11.2
Example: T-junction on a single carriageway
For a T-junction on a single carriageway there are two different site categories in effect, as described
below and shown in Figure A.2. In some cases other site categories may also be required due to other
events occurring in the vicinity.
In the figure for this example the major road (where traffic has permanent priority) is the 'horizontal'
road and the minor road (where traffic is required to give way) is the 'vertical' road.

Figure A.2 Site categories for junction approaches on a single carriageway
On the minor road a category of Q should be applied to the 50m approach to the junction. This length
may be extended if queuing is likely. The remaining length (including the lane with traffic moving away
from the junction) should be given a category of C.
On the major road a category of Q should be applied to the extent of the junction and the 50m leading
to the junction (in the direction of traffic on the major road) for both lanes. This length may be extended
if the risk of traffic having to brake unexpectedly is higher than usual. The remaining length of the major
road should be given a category of C (if appropriate to the site geometry/layout).
A11.3
Example: Priority junction
For a priority junction between two single carriageways there are two different site categories in effect,
as described below and shown in Figure A.3. In some cases other site categories may also be required
due to other events occurring in the vicinity.
In the figure for this example the "major road" (where traffic has permanent priority) is the top part of the
'horizontal' road (traffic moving from left to right) and the bottom part of the horizontal road (traffic
moving from right to left). The "minor roads" are the 'vertical' road and the turn lane of the horizontal
road. This example is assuming that right turns from the vertical road are prohibited.

Appendix A. Application of site categories and Investiga...
Figure A.3 Site categories for a priority junction
The top part of the 'horizontal' road ("major road") should have a category of Q applied to the extent of
the junction and the 50m leading to the junction (in the direction of traffic on the major road). This
length may be extended if the risk of traffic having to brake unexpectedly is higher than usual. The
remainder of the top part of the horizontal road should have the appropriate non-event category applied
(in this case C).
The turn lane ("minor road") should have a category of Q applied to the 50m approach to the give way.
The bottom part of the 'horizontal' road ("major road") should have a category of Q applied to the 50m
approach to the start of the junction and for the extent of the junction. As the two lanes described
above are running lanes from the same carriageway with traffic in the same direction, they should have
the same site category and IL applied along their coinciding length (see clause 4.9).
The 'vertical' road (one of the "minor roads") should have a category of Q applied to the 50-m approach
to the junction. This length may be extended if queuing is likely. The remaining length (including the
lane with traffic moving away from the junction) should have the appropriate non-event category
applied (in this case C).
A11.4
Example: Roundabout with a pedestrian crossing
For a roundabout with a pedestrian crossing on an approach or exit, there are four different site
categories in effect (if all of the roads are single carriageway), as described below and shown in Figure
A.4. In some cases other site categories may also be required due to other events occurring in the
vicinity.

Figure A.4 Site categories for a roundabout with a pedestrian crossing
A site category of K should be applied to the 50m approach to the pedestrian crossing. This length may
be extended depending on the likelihood of traffic having to brake unexpectedly.
The roundabout should be assigned a category of R for its whole length. Note, if this was a signalised
roundabout, the roundabout would still be assigned a category of R for its whole length.
The approaches to the roundabout should all have category Q applied for the 50m approach. This
length may be extended if queuing is likely. Also if the remaining distance between this category and
the crossing is small then this category may be extended back to the crossing.
The remaining lengths should have category C applied (if appropriate to its geometry/layout), as they
are all non-event carriageways with two-way traffic.
A11.5
Example: Signal controlled crossroads involving a dual carriageway road and a single
carriageway road
For this type of crossroads there are four different site categories in effect, as described below and
shown in Figure A.5. In some cases other site categories may also be required due to other events
occurring in the vicinity.

The extent of the junction (i.e. in this case, the area enclosed by the pedestrian crossings) should have
a category of Q applied to it. The remaining lengths should have the appropriate non-event site
categories applied (B for the dual carriageway and C for the single carriageway).

E/1. Single annual skid survey (SASS) approach to ...
E/1.
Single annual skid survey (SASS) approach to calculation of CSC
Overview of SASS approach
E/1.1
The method shall use measurements from the preceding three years to characterise the long-term skid
resistance of the network.
E/1.2
The long-term value of skid resistance shall be used, with the mean network skid resistance in the
current year, to calculate a correction factor that is applied to the current year's data to make current
values consistent with the long-term average.
E/1.3
Sections which have had resurfacings carried out in the last three years shall be identified and removed
from the calculation procedure for the correction factors.
NOTE
The SASS approach takes account of yearly variation and therefore the calculations are affected by
maintenance carried out in the last three years.
E/1.4
Larger highway networks shall be split into smaller localities.
E/1.5
The correction factor shall be determined and applied separately within each locality.
NOTE
The effect of seasonal variation will vary in different geographical areas (such as due to different
amounts of rainfall), therefore necessitating the need for a local approach.
E/1.6
The whole network shall be surveyed once during the test season in each year.
E/1.7
Surveys shall be planned such that in successive years each road length is tested in the early, middle
and late parts of the season.
E/1.7.1
As a route tested in the early part of the season in year 1 could be tested in the late part of the season
in year 2 and in the middle part of the season in year 3, in year four, it should be tested in the early part
of the season again, and so forth.
E/1.8
Each site on the network shall be allocated to a locality by the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
A locality is a collection of road sections or routes for which a correction factor can be determined.
E/1.9
A locality shall be small enough so that similar weather conditions would normally be experienced within
it and large enough so that a stable value can be calculated to represent the long-term skid resistance.
NOTE
This approach is based on the assumption that the climatic effects leading to seasonal variation can
influence all the roads in a local area in a similar way.
E/1.10
All the road sections within each locality shall be surveyed within the same part of the test season.
NOTE
By surveying all road sections within a locality at the same time, this method can remove a component
of the within-year seasonal variation as well as the variation between years.
E/1.11
The local equilibrium correction factor (LECF) is the correction factor that shall be used within each
locality to bring the current year data to a level consistent with the long-term average.
NOTE
The LECF is calculated in three stages.
E/1.12
The local equilibrium SC (LESC) shall be determined to represent the average skid resistance level for
the locality over recent years.
NOTE
The LESC is the average SC, calculated for all valid 10-m sub-section measurements in the defined
locality over the three years that precede the current testing season.
E/1.13
The LESC shall contain surveys from each of the three parts of the test season with valid
measurements being those that were made in the required part of the test season, on the required test
line, and on road surfaces that were at least 12 months old at the time of testing.
E/1.13.1
As a consequence of Cl. E/1.12, if a length of road has been resurfaced within the last four years then
that length should be excluded from the LECF calculation.

E/1.14
The Local Mean SC (LMSC) shall be determined for the current survey. The LMSC is the average of all
valid 10-m sub-sections in the locality in the current year survey.
E/1.15
The LECF shall be determined by dividing the LESC by the LMSC, that is:
Equation E/1.15 Calculation of LECF
LECF = LESC
LMSC
E/1.16
The CSC for each 10-m sub-section shall be determined by multiplying the corrected SC by the LECF.

Procedure for identifying sites requiring detailed investigation
Highways England crash model
E/2.1
A crash model which has been developed for Highways England shall be used to identify sites requiring
detailed investigation on motorway and all-purpose trunk roads managed by Highways England.
NOTE 1
Further information about the crash model, its development and testing can be found in TRL report TRL
CPR 1308 2009 [Ref 1.I] and TRL report TRL CPR921 2010 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 2
The crash model can be obtained from Highways England.
NOTE 3
The crash model utilises crash trends (both rate and severity) from historic Highways England data to
predict the expected crash saving from the application of a surface treatment. The model requires the
input of crash counts for the latest 3 years, CSC values and Site Category. It then produces a score
which can be used to identify if the site requires detailed investigation. The documentation supplied
with the crash model gives guidance on the site scores that trigger a detailed site investigation.
E/2.2
Sites that have been identified for reasons other than skid resistance (see Cl. 5.6 of main document)
shall not be removed by this process.

NI/1.
Benchmark sites approach to calculation of CSC
Benchmark sites approach calculation procedure
NI/1.1
A number of benchmark sites to cover a relevant geographical area shall be agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation.
NI/1.2
The benchmark sites shall all be tested three times with surveys spread through each testing season to
provide mean summer skid coefficient (MSSC) values.
NOTE
MSSC values are calculated by taking the average of the three survey periods for each 10m length.
NI/1.3
An overall average MSSC value for each area shall be calculated.
NI/1.4
The whole of the selected network shall be tested once in each year.
NI/1.4.1
Different parts of the network may be surveyed in different parts of the testing season.
NI/1.5
Whenever a part of the network is surveyed, all the benchmark sites shall be tested at the same time.
NOTE 1
The LECF is the correction factor determined for the network area to bring the current year data to a
level consistent with the long-term average.
NOTE 2
With this method it is assumed that the average behaviour of the benchmark sites is representative of
the area and that the climatic effects leading to seasonal variation between years will have influenced
all of the benchmark sites in an area in a similar way.
NOTE 3
By surveying the benchmark sites three times each season, some account can be taken of the
within-year variation.
NOTE 4
Comparing the benchmark sites in successive years allows the effects of between-year variation to be
reduced.
NI/1.6
The LECF shall be calculated in five stages:
1) the mean summer correction factor (MSCF) to be determined in order to take account of the variation
in skid resistance between the time of a particular survey and the average during the testing season;
2) the MSSC for each 10-m sub-section in the survey to be estimated by multiplying the SC for each
valid 10-m sub-section by the MSCF;
3) the LESC to be determined to represent the average skid resistance level in the area over recent
years;
4) the LMSC to be determined to represent the average skid resistance level in the area for the current
testing season; and
5) the LECF to be determined by dividing the LESC by the LMSC, that is:
Equation NI/1.6 Calculation of LECF
LECF = LESC
LMSC
NOTE 1
The MSCF is the overall average of the benchmark sites in the same area for the testing season,
divided by the average of all of these benchmark sites for the survey period of the relevant survey.
NOTE 2
The LESC is the overall average MSSC for all of the benchmark sites over the three years that precede
the current testing season (with lengths that have undergone treatment in the last four years excluded).
NOTE 3
The LMSC is the average MSSC of all benchmark sites in the area for the current testing season (with
lengths that have undergone treatment in the last four years excluded).
NI/1.7
The CSC for each 10-m sub-section shall be determined by multiplying the estimated MSSC for each
10-m sub-section by the LECF.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Transport Scotland-specific requirements related to the
application of seasonal correction to skid resistance measurements, the process for identifying sites
that require a detailed investigation and the identification of sites where slippery road warning signs are
required.
Additional guidance on the application of site categories and investigatory levels to the Scottish trunk
road network is provided in the Transport Scotland Interim Amendment - Skidding Resistance TSIA
51/20 [Ref 2.N].
The guidance document can be obtained from Transport Scotland.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

S/1. Single annual skid survey (SASS) approach to ...
S/1.
Single annual skid survey (SASS) approach to calculation of CSC
S/1.1
The method shall use measurements from the preceding three years to characterise the long-term skid
resistance of the network.
S/1.2
The long-term value of skid resistance shall be used, with the mean network skid resistance in the
current year, to calculate a correction factor that is applied to the current year's data to make current
values consistent with the long-term average.
S/1.3
Sections which have had resurfacings carried out in the last three years shall be identified and removed
from the calculation procedure for the correction factors.
NOTE
The SASS approach takes account of yearly variation and therefore the calculations are affected by
maintenance carried out in the last three years.
S/1.4
Larger highway networks shall be split into smaller localities.
S/1.5
The correction factor shall be determined and applied separately within each locality.
NOTE
The effect of seasonal variation will vary in different geographical areas (such as due to different
amounts of rainfall), therefore necessitating the need for a local approach.
S/1.6
The whole network shall be surveyed once during the test season in each year.
S/1.7
Surveys shall be planned such that in successive years each road length is tested in the early, middle
and late parts of the season.
S/1.7.1
As a route tested in the early part of the season in year 1 could be tested in the late part of the season
in year 2 and in the middle part of the season in year 3, in year 4, it should be tested in the early part of
the season again, and so forth.
S/1.8
Each site on the network shall be allocated to a locality according to the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
A locality is a collection of road sections or routes for which a correction factor can be determined.
S/1.9
A locality shall be small enough so that similar weather conditions would normally be experienced within
it and large enough so that a stable value can be calculated to represent the long-term skid resistance.
NOTE
This approach is based on the assumption that the climatic effects leading to seasonal variation can
influence all the roads in a local area in a similar way.
S/1.10
All the road sections within each locality shall be surveyed within the same part of the test season.
NOTE
By surveying all road sections within a locality at the same time, this method can remove a component
of the within-year seasonal variation as well as the variation between years.
S/1.11
The local equilibrium correction factor (LECF) is the correction factor that shall be used within each
locality to bring the current year data to a level consistent with the long-term average.
NOTE
The LECF is calculated in three stages.
S/1.12
The local equilibrium SC (LESC) shall be determined to represent the average skid resistance level for
the locality over recent years.
NOTE
The LESC is the average SC, calculated for all valid 10-m sub-section measurements in the defined
locality over the three years that precede the current testing season.
S/1.13
The LESC shall contain surveys from each of the three parts of the test season with valid
measurements being those that were made in the required part of the test season, on the required test
line, and on road surfaces that were at least 12 months old at the time of testing.
S/1.13.1
As a consequence of clause S/1.12, if a length of road has been resurfaced within the last four years
then that length should be excluded from the LECF calculation.
S/1.14
The local mean SC (LMSC) shall be determined for the current survey.
NOTE
The LMSC is the average of all valid 10-m sub-sections in the locality in the current year survey.
S/1.15
The LECF shall be determined by dividing the LESC by the LMSC, that is:

W/1.
Single annual skid survey (SASS) approach to calculation of CSC
Overview of SASS approach
W/1.1
The SASS approach shall use measurements from the preceding three years to characterise the
long-term skid resistance of the network, based upon a single annual survey of the network.
W/1.2
The long-term value of skid resistance shall be used, with the mean network skid resistance in the
current year, to calculate a correction factor which is applied to the current year's data to make current
values consistent with the long-term average.
W/1.3
Network sections that have had resurfacings carried out in the last three years shall be identified and
removed from the calculation procedure for the correction factors.
NOTE
The SASS approach takes account of yearly variation and therefore the calculations are affected by
maintenance carried out in the last three years.
W/1.4
Larger networks shall be split into smaller localities.
NOTE
The effect of seasonal variations will vary in different geographical areas (such as due to different
amounts of rainfall) necessitating a more local approach.
W/1.5
The correction factor shall be determined and applied separately within each locality.
W/1.6
The whole network shall be surveyed once during the test season in each year.
W/1.7
Surveys shall be planned such that in successive years each road length is tested in the early, middle
and late parts of the season.
W/1.7.1
For example, a route may be tested in the early part of the season in year 1, tested in the late part of
the season in year 2 and in the middle part of the season in year 3.
W/1.7.2
In year four the same route should be tested in the early part of the season again, and so forth.
NOTE
Road sections are located within localities for North, Mid and South Wales.
W/1.8
A correction factor for each locality shall be calculated to represent long-term skid resistance
appropriate to the climatic region.
NOTE
This approach is based on the assumption that the climatic effects leading to seasonal variation can
influence all the roads in a local area in a similar way.
W/1.9
All the road sections within each locality shall be surveyed within the same part of the test season.
NOTE
By surveying all road sections within a locality at the same time, this method can remove a component
of the within-year seasonal variation as well as the variation between years.
W/1.10
The local equilibrium correction factor (LECF) is the correction factor that shall be used within each
locality to bring the current year data to a level consistent with the long-term average.
W/1.11
The LECF shall be calculated in three stages:
1) the local equilibrium SC (LESC) is determined to represent the average skid resistance level for the
locality over recent years;
2) the Local Mean SC (LMSC) is determined for the current survey as the average of all valid 10-m
sub-sections in the locality in the current year survey;
3) the LECF is determined by dividing the LESC by the LMSC, as:
Equation W/1.11 Calculation of LECF
LECF = LESC
LMSC
W/1.11.1
If a length of road has been resurfaced within the last four years then that length should be excluded
from the LECF calculation.
