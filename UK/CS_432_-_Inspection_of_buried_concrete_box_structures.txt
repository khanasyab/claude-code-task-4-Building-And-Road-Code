Inspection
Purpose
2.1
Buried concrete box structures shall be inspected to identify and record the integrity and condition of
the structure and its components.
2.2
The inspection shall provide information on both the severity and extent of any change in the structure
to that originally constructed.
2.3
The results of an inspection shall be used to determine the type and timing of further interventions to
the structure.
NOTE
Interventions can include a structural review in accordance with CS 451 [Ref 2.I], assessment, further
inspections, an enhanced monitoring regime, maintenance, repair or upgrading works.
2.4
Ancillary structures (for example, headwalls and wing walls) shall also be inspected where they could
affect the function of the buried concrete box structure.
Inspection requirements
2.5
The requirements contained in CS 450 [Ref 1.N] shall be supplemented by the additional requirements
in this section.
2.6
The inspection of buried concrete box structures shall identify, where present, the following common
defects:
1)
shrinkage cracks on cast in-situ structures;
2)
differential settlement;
3)
failure in the joints between structural units;
4)
deterioration of the structural waterproofing and evidence of water ingress; and
5)
localised deterioration due to detailing faults and poor workmanship during construction.
NOTE 1
Some problems occur with both cast in-situ and precast structures while other problems can be specific
to the type of construction.
NOTE 2
Advice on the identification of common defects in buried concrete box structures is contained in
Appendix A.
2.7
The inspection of buried concrete box structures shall also identify, where present, the following less
common defects:
1)
scour and undercutting of the end elevations;
2)

structure;
3)
degradation and deterioration of the reinforced concrete; and
4)

NOTE 1
Even where defects are infrequent, when they do occur they can have a severe effect on the structural
integrity so it is important to identify them correctly.
NOTE 2
Advice on the identification of less common defects in buried concrete box structures is contained in
Appendix A.

Identification of defects
A1.1
General
Defects to buried concrete box structures include the lack of, or breakdown of, waterproofing systems
and poor drainage of the surrounding backfill. In most cases the subsequent deterioration, i.e. the
spalling of the concrete cover to the reinforcement, has been associated with the ingress of
groundwater.
At a number of sites, differential ground movements have been found to lead to the cracking of boxes
and to the failure of joints between individual units. Less common defects found include undermining by
scour, degradation of concrete by one or other chemical reactions and cracking induced by high loads.
A1.2
Background information on common defects
Shrinkage cracks can be evident on cast in-situ structures. These are usually as a result of the
construction process and in most cases do not present a problem. However, on occasions the cracks
can extend through the full thickness of the walls and slabs allowing the ingress of water (groundwater,
carried effluent or both) to the reinforcing steel and compromises the long-term durability of the
structure.
Precast units have been found to be less likely to exhibit shrinkage cracking because better control
during casting ensured a denser and more consistent finish.
Differential settlement can occur under high embankments built on soft ground which can lead to
vertical cracking of a buried concrete box structure. Buried concrete box structures can be inherently
susceptible to differential ground movements unless they are provided with joints to accommodate this
movement. In-situ concrete box structures can be particularly prone to cracking by differential
movements when constructed with too large a spacing between movement joints.
With both in-situ and precast concrete box structures, differential ground movements can induce failure
of the joints between units. Depending on the joint type, the movement needed to result in joint failure
can vary. Differential movement can also result in cracking of the concrete in the wing walls and at the
opening of joints between the wing walls and the box structure.
The deterioration of joints can result in the passage of water through the structure, often in preference
to the designed drainage routes. This in turn can lead to the concrete adjacent to a joint spalling, with
the associated risk of corrosion of the reinforcement.
Construction joints between the roof and side walls or the side walls and base can be at a higher risk of
deterioration for cast in-situ structures than for precast structures.
Waterproofing of a structure can deteriorate over time, allowing ingress of water. Evidence suggests
that waterproofing systems are most likely to fail near impaired construction joints. Structures with
waterproofing membranes on their top slab and with drainage systems behind the side walls perform
better than those without such features.
Poor detailing on early constructed structures, where the waterproofing membranes did not extend at
least 200 mm down the sidewalls can contribute to a breakdown in the waterproofing system. Failure of
the drainage system can also lead to a build up of hydrostatic pressure and possible leakage of the
waterproofing system.
Faults in the detailing and poor workmanship during construction can lead to localised deterioration of
the structure. The detailing of wing and head walls is sometimes a weak link in the overall design,
leading to problems with cracking described above.
In some cases the top slab can be damaged by careless installation of parapets and safety fences
above the structure with the holding down bolts penetrating through the roof of the structure allowing
the ingress of water.

A1.3
Background information on less common defects
Scour and undercutting of the end elevations can occur with a culvert carrying a watercourse. If scour
continues, the structure becomes undermined.
Mining of coal and other minerals can propagate ground movement near the structure. Information
about mining activities should be held on the structure record file. Early signs of distress in the structure
is often accompanied with severe differential movement. Older structures are most at risk in high-risk
areas as recent structural designs should have taken the effects of mining subsidence into account.
Degradation of reinforced concrete can result from chemical reactions between constituents of the
cement and the aggregate or between constituents in the concrete and the surrounding soils or
groundwater. Alkali silica reaction is an expansive reaction of the alkali in cement and silica in the
aggregate and can induce extensive cracking of concrete. Other reactions which can occur include the
oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds (such as pyrite) in structural backfill to produce the thaumasite
form of sulphate attack on buried concrete. The presence of chloride ions, derived from deicing salts,
can promote the corrosion of the steel reinforcement.
Other than cases of deterioration of the concrete in box structures due to the presence of chloride ions,
deterioration resulting from other chemical processes are rare. However where identified, expert advice
may need to be sought on appropriate remedial measures.
Further information on the degradation of reinforced concrete due to aggressive ground and
groundwater can be found in BRE SD-1 [Ref 1.I].
Cracking through excessive loading can be seen on structures with a particularly thin depth of cover
and which were not designed to carry abnormal vehicle loads. The passage of heavy and abnormal
vehicles can cause cracks to open and close which widen with time with the edges becoming fretted
away by the movement of the structure or weathering.
