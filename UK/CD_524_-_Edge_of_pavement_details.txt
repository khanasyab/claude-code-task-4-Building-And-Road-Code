Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document represents the combination of two former advice documents HA 39/98 'Road edge
details' and HA 83/99 'Safety aspects of road edge drainage features'.
The document has rationalised any duplication between the two source documents and does not
include any information in the two source documents that is not related to road edge drainage features.
The document includes the figures and requirements for edge of pavement drains previously shown in
the B and F Series of HCD drawings in MCHW.
Section 3 of the document includes requirements and advice on surface water channels. Surface water
channels are described in further detail in document CD 521 [Ref 9.N]. In order to prevent duplication of
information, Section 3 of this document includes several cross-references to CD 521 [Ref 9.N].
Tables summarising scenarios for use and pros and cons of the types of drainage solution available are
presented in CG 501 [Ref 3.N].
This document supersedes the figures and requirements previously shown in the Highway Construction
Details (HCD), B series (all) and F series drawings F15, F16, F18, F19, F20 and F21.
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 5.N].
Assumptions in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 10.N] apply to this document.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the design of edge of pavement drainage details.
NOTE
The figures in this document depict pavement edge details dealing principally with drainage aspects of
highway verges and central reserves.
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving highway drainage on the
Overseeing Organisation's motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 10.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 10.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.
Health and safety
1.4
Unless protected from direct traffic, road edge drainage features shall be capable of withstanding the
structural loading imposed on them during normal usage and the structural loading that can be imposed
on them during lane closures and consequent trafficking of hard shoulders.
1.5
Road edge drainage features shall be designed to mitigate the effects on errant vehicles leaving the
carriageway.
NOTE
The road edge drainage features can present a potential hazard to errant vehicles leaving the
carriageway.
1.6
The selection of road edge drainage features shall be guided by the health and safety issues
associated with the maintenance needs of the features which is particularly important for central
reserve drainage where difficulty of access can exacerbate maintenance interventions.
NOTE 1
The road edge drainage feature plays a major part in road safety by removing surface water quickly.
NOTE 2
A suitable road edge drainage feature prevents damage to the structural foundations of the
carriageway. This, in turn, reduces the requirement for maintenance.
NOTE 3
Maintenance on motorways and other high speed roads involves a higher than normal degree of risk,
both to road users and maintenance operatives.
NOTE 4
Safety issues associated with rural roads differ from those associated with urban roads.

For further details and alternative surface treatment options refer to Figure 2.3.
NOTE 2
As combined surface and sub-surface filter drains incorporate pipes with relatively large diameters they
generally have an exceptionally large groundwater capacity which can extend as a cut-off below the
capping layer.
NOTE 3
Combined surface and sub-surface filter drains are appropriate for draining roads with long lengths of
zero longitudinal gradient.

2. Combined surface and sub-surface filter drain...
Figure 2.3d Combined surface and sub-surface filter drain surface Type Y
NOTE 1
Combined surface and sub-surface filter drains with Type Y surfaces as shown on Figure 2.3d are more
suitable for roads with flatter gradients where flow along the surface into catchpits is less assured.
NOTE 2
Combined surface and sub-surface filter drains with Type W surfaces as shown on Figure 2.3b have a
greater fall towards the centre of the drain because the reduced permeability of the thick surface layer
can result in greater flows along the surface.
NOTE 3
Guidance on the requirements for the pipe, bedding and trench of a combined surface and sub-surface
filter drain is provided in CD 533 [Ref 4.N].
2.3.1
The use of surface and sub-surface filter drains in central reserves should be avoided in order to
reduce health and safety risks during maintenance interventions.
2.3.2
Where combined surface and sub-surface filter drains are used in cuttings they may serve as carrier
drains.
NOTE
Separate fin or narrow filter drains are not required where combined surface and sub-surface filter
drains in cuttings function as carrier drains.
2.4
Filter, sub-base and topsoil materials for combined surface and sub-surface filter drains shall be
extended to the edge of the pavement layer.
2.5
The surface treatment to the combined surface and sub-surface filter drain shall be either topsoil or
sub-base.
2.6
The geotextile shown in Figure 2.3a shall be fixed in a pavement layer to provide required topsoil
thickness.
2.7
Where the filter drain utilises Type B filter media, a geotextile membrane shall be provided between the
filter drain and overlaying layers for drain Types W, X and Y.
2.8
The combined surface and sub-surface filter drains shall not result in saturated downstream conditions.
2.8.1

2. Combined surface and sub-surface filter drain...
2.9
Combined surface and sub-surface drains shall not be used in narrow verges subject to use by
equestrians.
Upper section of combined surface and sub-surface filter drains
2.10
The upper section of combined surface and sub-surface filter drains shall be designed to mitigate the
risk of stone scatter.
NOTE 1
Managing risks associated with stone scatter is described in DMRB CD 525 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
The treatment options depicted in Figure 2.3 incorporate measures to reduce stone scatter.
2.10.1
Where possible, more then one type of upper section should be specified in the contract with the final
choice being left to the contractor.
2.11
A lip shall be provided between the edge of carriageway and the top of the combined surface and
sub-surface filter drain.
NOTE
The purpose of the lip is to enable continuous over the edge drainage to be maintained and to reduce
the effect of build-up of vegetation.
2.12
The depth of the lip between the edge of carriageway and the top of the combined surface and
sub-surface filter drain depends on the the upper section type selected and shall be as shown in Figure
2.3.
2.12.1
Where Type 7 chambers as shown in CD 536 [Ref 1.N]are used to collect surface flows from combined
surface and sub-surface filter drains the chamber top should be set as dimensioned below the depth of
the lip.
2.13
The top surface of a combined surface and sub-surface filter drain shall be dished to allow high flows to
be channelled along the surface and into catchpits.
2.13.1
Catchpit grating levels should be calculated to suit the falls toward the centre of the drain.
Lower section of combined surface and sub-surface filter drains
2.14
The lower section of combined surface and sub-surface filter drains shall be designed as filter drains
and generally in accordance with the drawings in DMRB CD 533 [Ref 4.N].
2.14.1
Where possible, more than one type of lower section should be specified in the contract with the final
choice being left to the contractor.
NOTE
The lower section of combined surface and sub-surface filter drains are generally formed with Type B
material.
2.14.2
To avoid migration of fine sands and silts into the filter material, the lower section of combined surface
and sub-surface drains laid in fine sands and silts should be Type J or K as shown in DMRB CD 533
[Ref 4.N].
2.14.3
Lightweight aggregate may be used as the filter material for combined surface and sub-surface filter
drains Type G, H and I as shown in DMRB CD 533 [Ref 4.N].
2.15
To prolong the life of the combined surface and sub-surface filter drain, a geotextile membrane shall be
placed between the upper and lower sections of the drain for drains Type G, H and I as detailed in
DMRB CD 533 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
The upper and lower sections of the drain are terms that approximate to the upper and lower half of the
drain, and do not refer to the point where the filter material (or concrete) changes from one Type to
another.

Figure 3.9b Concrete surface water channel Type B
NOTE 1
The 40mm flat shown on the edge of the Type A channel is intended to minimise damage during
compaction of adjacent pavement layers.
NOTE 2
Type A and B channels indicate profiles of triangular surface water channels in solid lines. Broken lines
of width T at crossfall 1:40 denote base profile of trapezoidal surface water channel.
NOTE 3
Guidance on the requirements for dimensions W, V, l2 is provided in DMRB CD 521 [Ref 9.N].
3.9.1
Dimension h1 in Figure 3.9a should be a minimum of 200 mm in order to provide a robust section
capable of withstanding occasional vehicle overrun.
NOTE 1
In rigid carriageway construction, dimension h1 can be lower than 200 mm where the channel and slab
are slipformed together. See Type B as depicted in Figure 3.9b.
NOTE 2
Depending on the pavement alternative chosen, the value of dimension h1 can be increased to found it
on a convenient pavement layer.
3.9.2
Where the surface water channel is on an embankment, dimension Y in Figure 3.9 may be set so that
flooding is avoided by allowing excess water to flow onto the verge and down the embankment slope.
NOTE
Dimension Y is the difference in level between the back edge of the channel and the level of the
carriageway, hardshoulder or hardstrip adjacent to the channel.
3.9.3
This optimum value of Y may vary with road geometry and discharge volumes for each outfall.
NOTE
For uniformity of channel cross section over the scheme, dimension Y can be set at the level required
for the most vulnerable flood section.
3.9.4
The angle α of the edge of channel should be between 0 and 5 degrees.
3.9.5
Where carriageway levels differ appreciably, the channel and central reserve profile should be modified
from that shown in Figures 3.5 and 3.6.
Application
3.10
Channel Type B shall be used be when the carriageway and channel are slipformed simultaneously.
3.11
Channel Type B shall be deemed to be a continuation of the carriageway slab and reinforced
accordingly.
3.12
The concrete for Type B channel shall be as specified for the concrete slab.

Edge-of-pavement drains
7.1
Edge-of-pavement drains shall be included on all roads except the following:
1)
roads with combined surface and sub-surface drains;
2)
roads comprising rigid or flexible carriageways with over-the-edge drainage; nor,
3)
roads with free draining sub-grade.
NOTE
The purpose of edge-of-pavement drainage is to provide sub-surface drainage for the pavement layers,
sub-base and capping (if permeable). Sub-surface drainage ensures that the road does not fail
prematurely through water-related deterioration.
7.2
Edge-of-pavement drains shall be formed with fin drains or narrow filter drains.
NOTE 1
Typical fin drain and filter drain types are included within this section.
NOTE 2
The edge-of-pavement details are included within the figures in this document.
7.3
The fin drain and narrow filter drain installation details shall be modified according to the relevant edge
of pavement detail shown in this document.
7.3.1
The selection of a fin drain or filter drain system to drain pavement layers of a road in a cutting should be
influenced by considerations of possible groundwater, drainage during construction and whether or not
a longitudinal carrier drain facility is necessary to transport surface water runoff from the carriageways.
NOTE
Fin drains and narrow filter drains can be unsuitable for dealing with high groundwater flows or where a
longitudinal carrier drain is necessary to transport surface water runoff from the carriageways.
7.3.2
Where the subbase comprises cement bound granular mixture (CBGM) or where cement or lime
stabilisation is proposed, the drain selected should be less vulnerable to the build-up of calcium-based
deposits.
7.4
Narrow filter drains shall always be included on the low side of carriageways on embankments.
7.4.1
Drainage design should allow as wide a range of edge-of-pavement drain types as possible in order to
deliver the most effective solution.
7.5
Fin drains and narrow filter drains which form part of the permanent works shall not be used for the
disposal of surface water runoff during construction.
7.6
Fin drains and narrow filter drains shall be a minimum of 75mm from the edge of the surface water
channel.
7.7
Fin drains shall have one geotextile face in contact with the side of the excavation.
7.8
Narrow filter drains shall have one face in contact with the pavement construction.
7.9
The side of the fin drain with the greater permeability shall be facing towards and be in contact with the
pavement construction.
Fin drain Type 5
7.10
Type 5 fin drains shall be in accordance with Figure 7.10.

Fin drain Type 10
7.15
Type 10 fin drains shall be in accordance with Figure 7.15.
Figure 7.15 Fin drain Type 10
7.15.1
Type 10 fin drains should either have an impermeable side or be covered by an impermeable
membrane unless no significant blocking of the core will occur during the slip-forming of the drainage
channel.
7.15.2
Edge-of-pavement drains under channel drainage layers should be Type 10 drains as depicted in
Figure 7.15 provided that their use is possible.
NOTE 1
The width of the Type 10 fin drain = h1 (200mm min) + l1 (varies) + h2 (varies).
NOTE 2
The purpose of the under channel drain is to intercept any water which percolates through the road
surface or edge of carriageway seal into the pavement layers and sub-base.
NOTE 3
The under channel drainage layer depicted in Figure 7.15 is shown for use with rigid carriageways but it
can also be used in conjunction with flexible carriageways.
NOTE 4
Where it is impractical to use the detail in Figure 7.15, proven alternative drainage methods (for
example, a layer of free draining granular material) below the channel can be used in order to to
provide a pathway to the sub-surface drain.
NOTE 5
Further applications of the Type 10 fin drain are shown in figures within this document.
Fin drain design
7.16
The design outputs for fin drains shall be:
1)
fin drain type;
2)

the long term in-plane flow - near vertical downward flow;
8)
the long term in-plane flow - along the drain parallel to the road edge (Type 5 only);
9)
fin drain internal pipe diameter (Types 6 and 7 only).
10)
pipe surround material (Types 6 and 7 only);
11)
trench backfill material (Types 6 and 7 only).
7.16.1
Drainage capacities should be designed for the gradients at which fin drains are to be installed and
outfall lengths determined accordingly.
7.16.2
For drain Type 5 the flow rates should be the capacity required linearly extrapolated to the standard
gradients in Appendix A4.
7.16.3
The maximum drain slope angle should be a maximum 15% from the vertical.
NOTE
Where fin drains utilise a pipe, capacities can be obtained from hydraulic tables and the required
diameter specified.
7.17
Where fin drains are designed for lateral entry of water from one side only, the flow rate requirements
shall apply to the face or plane designed to admit or transmit water.
7.17.1
The in-plane flow design capacity should allow for infiltration through the pavement and verges and any
other source of ground water ingress.
7.17.2
A value not less than the mean intensity of a one year 2 hour rainfall should be assumed for the
in-plane flow design capacity.
7.17.3
The fin drain Type 5 acts both as a filter drain and a carrier pipe and therefore in-plane flow should be
specified for flow both along the drain parallel to the road edge and near-vertically down the drain.
7.17.4
For all other fin drain types, only near-vertical downward flow should be specified.
7.18
Fin drain joints transverse to the direction of flow shall have values of in-plane flow rates not less than
that required in clause 7.16 of this document.
7.19
Fin drain joints parallel to the direction of flow and any exposed edges shall be protected from the
ingress of soil by a geotextile wrapping with a minimum overlap of 150mm.
Narrow filter drain design
7.20
The design outputs for narrow filter drains shall be:
1)
narrow filter drain drain type;
2)
narrow filter drain pipe diameter;
3)
offset distance from edge of carriageway;
4)
upstream and downstream chamber/ headwall reference;
5)
upstream and downstream invert level;
6)
maximum drain slope angle to the vertical;
7)
category for tolerances at mid-size sieves for the granular material within the narrow filter drain;
8)
minimum permeability of granular material within the narrow filter drain.
7.20.1
The design on narrow filter drains should integrate the adjacent soil or construction layer.
7.20.2
The maximum drain slope angle should be a maximum 15% from the vertical.
7.20.3
The granular material for narrow filter drains should have a minimum permeability of 1 x 10-4 m/s which
is similar to that obtained by a clean coarse sand may be assumed.
7.20.4
For the Type 8 drain, pore sizes for the sock material should be designed to retain the finer soil
particles outside the trench.

Geotextile design
7.21
Where a filtration/ separation geotextile is required in accordance with BS EN 13252 [Ref 7.N], the
following performance characteristics shall be specified:
1)
tensile strength;
2)
elongation at maximum load;
3)
resistance to static puncture;
4)
dynamic perforation resistance;
5)
characteristic maximum opening size (O90);
6)
water permeability normal to the plane;
7)
durability.
7.21.1
The pore size for the geotextile should be selected using filtration criteria to be compatible with the
adjacent soil or construction layer in order to prevent the occurrence of piping.
7.21.2
The following soil retention criteria may be used in determining O90.

O90/d90 < 1
or
O90/d50 < 3
O90/d90 < 1.8
or
O90/d50 < 6
NOTE 1
dn = n% size in base soil (n% is finer).
NOTE 2
O90 = 90% opening (pore) size of geotextile (90% of openings are smaller).
NOTE 3
In general, it will be sufficient to specify only the maximum value of O90 that will satisfactorily retain the
adjacent soil particles as the minimum O90 size will be governed by the permeability requirements.
7.21.3
The finest O90 relevant to the various soil deposits likely to be encountered should be specified.
7.21.4
An O90 value of 1 mm should be considered as the upper limit even with large grained soils.
7.21.5
A maximum O90 value of 250 microns should be used for cohesive fine grained soils such as clays.
NOTE
In such cases the cohesion of the soil particles themselves is relied upon to prevent piping.
7.21.6
An O90 value of less than 250 microns should be considered with dispersive silts.
NOTE
Geotextile with small pore sizes can become clogged with fine particles and hence render the drain
unserviceable and also hinder the temporary removal of the filter material during on-site cleaning.
7.21.7
The specified flow rate normal to the geotextile wrapping should incorporate a margin of safety to allow
for the following:
1)
the impeded flow due to the adjacent core of the fin drain (or the filter material in a narrow filter
drain) as described in Appendix A1;
2)
the reduction of flow with time due to clogging.
7.21.8
A minimum flow rate normal to the plane of 10 litres/m2/sec should be used against the unbound
mixture for subbase and capping.

8. Combined drainage and kerb systems
NOTE 1
Although combined drainage and kerb systems are useful on roads with relatively flat gradients, they
are prone to the build-up of sediment and debris which can impede flow into and within the system.
NOTE 2
Combined drainage and kerb systems are useful in urban areas where there is a high incidence of
utility services because they do not need as great a depth of excavation as piped systems.
NOTE 3
The dual function of combined drainage and kerb systems can offer cost savings in certain
circumstances.
8.1.1
Where a capping layer is not present, the bedding concrete may be placed on fill, existing ground or the
sub-base.

Combined drainage and kerb systems are, by their very nature, hollow. Consequently they can be less
robust than solid kerbs equivalents of same general dimensions.
8.7
Placement of kerbs shall be in accordance with the provisions of DMRB CD 127 [Ref 2.N].
8.8
Combined kerb and drainage systems located in motorways and all-purpose trunk roads that are not
protected from direct traffic load shall be a minimum of Class D400 systems.
8.9
Combined kerb and channel drainage systems located in motorways and all-purpose trunk roads that
are protected from direct traffic load shall be a minimum of Class C250 systems.

Where the AADT LGV for a carriageway exceeds 1500 in each direction Class E600 combined kerb
drainage units shall be used.
8.11
The combined kerb and drainage system shall incorporate measures to enable rodding of the outfall
pipework.
8.12
The combined kerb and drainage system shall provide access for jetting by water jetting equipment into
the system.

Appendix A. Fin drain testing
A1
Test method for the percentage contact area of drainage core
The test determines the area of one face of a drainage core which will be in contact with a geotextile
filter as a percentage
The apparatus required is to be as follows:
1)
loading device able to apply a compressive load of at least 2kN and having a flat steel base;
2)
flat steel loading plate 200 mm x 200 mm;
3)
printers ink and roller (or pad);
4)
sheet of thin compressible rubber; and,
5)
planimeter.
The test procedure is to be as follows:
1)
cut three representative test specimens 200 mm x 200 mm (±2 mm);
2)
apply ink to one 200 mm x 200 mm face of a specimen and cover with a sheet of plain paper and
a thin compressible rubber sheet;
3)
place the prepared specimen in to the loading device and gradually apply the load of 2 kN and
maintain for 5 minutes;
4)
release the load and remove the specimen and separate it from the paper;
5)
using the planimeter find the total area of the paper which has received an imprint;
6)
repeat for all specimens.
The percentage contact area = (total area of imprint/area of test specimen) x 100
The report is to include:
1)
a reference to this method;
2)
sample identification details;
3)
individual and mean percentage contact areas; and,
4)
details of any deviation from the specified test procedure.
Alternative methods of determining the percentage contact area may be employed with the prior
approval of the Overseeing Organisation.
A2
Test method for determining the thickness of the fin drain core under specified
normal and shear stresses
The test determines the thickness of the fin drain under sustained normal and shear stresses. A long
term thickness (at 100,000 hours) is calculated by extrapolation and a short term equivalent normal
load which produces the long term thickness is determined.
The apparatus required is as follows:
1)
a suitable compression testing machine, which is to have a vertical travel at least the nominal
thickness of the specimen. It is to be capable of sustaining the necessary loads to within 1%
accuracy for the duration of the test;
2)
the compression testing apparatus, which is to include a fixed base plate and parallel moveable
top plate with flat steel surface with sufficient friction to permit the development of the required
shear forces;
3)
a means of measuring the mean thickness of the specimen to an accuracy of 0.01mm.
As an alternative to 1) and 2) above, an appropriate inclined plane and kentledge system can be
employed to produce the normal and shear loads.

Appendix A. Fin drain testing
The test procedure is to be as follows:
1)
cut six representative specimens of minimum size 100mm x 100mm symmetrically about the core
design. Three specimens are to be tested in accordance with 3) below and three in accordance
with 4) below;
2)
the test specimen is to be placed symmetrically on the base plate and covered by the top plate.
The means of measuring thickness is to be attached and the initial thickness measured;
3)
apply the load smoothly and as quickly as possible to the top plate. The full load (normal and
shear) is to be applied in less than 20 seconds and sustained for at least 1000 hours. The applied
stresses are to be those given in Clause A4. At least four measurements of thickness are to be
made during each unit of logarithmic time after the first minute. Determine the long term
thickness of the specimen as the thickness of the specimen at 1000 hours reduced by 2T where
T is the difference in thicknesses of the specimen thickness recorded at 100 hours and 1000
hours. Repeat the test on the two other specimens.The test specimens are to be maintained at a
constant temperature of 20°C ± 2°C throughout the test period.
4)
apply increasing increments of normal load to the specimen. Determine the short term equivalent
load which is the load which when applied for a period of 20±5 minutes produces a specimen
thickness equal (within an accuracy of ±0.05mm) to the long term thickness of the specimen
obtained at 3) above. Repeat the test on the other two specimens.
5)
the report is to include the following listed in table A.1
Table A.1 To include in the report
1
a reference to this method
2
sample identification details;
3
the initial thickness of the sample
4

6
a plot of percentage reduction in thickness against logarithmic time
7
the mean long term thickness
8
the mean short term equivalent load
9
any deviations from the specified test procedure
A3
Determining in-plane flow under compressive loading
In-plane flow is to be determined in accordance with BS EN ISO 12958 [Ref 8.N]except that the
following conditions are to apply:
1)
the applied normal stress is to be the greater of the value given in Table A.2 (Clause A3) or the
mean short term equivalent stress as determined in Clause A2 (item 4 of the test procedure);
2)
the sample is to be tested such that the measured flow (or flows) is in the same direction as the
principal flow (or flows) when the fin drain is in service;
3)
the foam rubber option of the test procedure is to be used (details of the foam rubber to be used
may be obtained from the Overseeing Organisation); and,
4)
the hydraulic transmissivity is to be reported for each of the hydraulic gradients employed.

Test methods
Notwithstanding the requirements of A1, A2 and A3, variations in the test methods specified therein are
to be made where deemed necessary by the British Board of Agrément (or equivalent) following
consultation with the manufacturer. All such variations are to be recorded in the report.
A6
Material requirements
The materials of which the drain is made are to be treated so that they are protected from the
deleterious effects of short term exposure to ultraviolet light, and are to be resistant to degradation by
acids, alkalis, common chemicals, bacteria, fungi and moulds occurring in soils and highway
construction materials.
Fin drains are to be capable of being jointed longitudinally or laterally into pipe systems or chambers for
inflow and outflow purposes and be self jointing either directly or through purpose made attachment
pieces for forming continuous drain lengths
