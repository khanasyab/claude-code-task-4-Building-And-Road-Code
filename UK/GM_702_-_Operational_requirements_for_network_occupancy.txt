Outcomes
E/2.1
The following outcomes shall be delivered:
1)
complete knowledge of all occupancies of motorway and all-purpose trunk roads;
2)
complete knowledge of all items which adversely impact road users of motorway and all-purpose
trunk roads;
3)
all occupancies are managed to secure the expeditious movement of traffic on motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads and facilitate the expeditious movement of traffic on motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads for which another authority is the traffic authority; and,
4)
the effective utilisation and optimisation of all occupancies of motorway and all-purpose trunk
roads.
E/2.2
Works shall be co-ordinated with other works to minimise their adverse impact on road users and road

Network occupancy management system
E/4.1
All occupancies, events and planned events shall be entered onto the network occupancy management
system (NOMS) in accordance with the integrated asset management system on line user guidance
Iamis-Noms Portal [Ref 2.N].
E/4.2
Once a booking has been entered onto NOMS the works promoter shall be informed that the booking:
1)
has been accepted as an authorised occupancy; or
2)
clashes with another booking; or,
3)
is not acceptable.
E/4.3
No planned occupancy shall take place without the confirmation of an authorised occupancy from
National Highways.
E/4.4
All planned occupancies shall be submitted to National Highways in the format prescribed in the NOP
for the purpose of creating a NOMS booking.
E/4.5
Where a NOMS booking requires a temporary traffic regulation order (TTRO), it shall be submitted to
National Highways a minimum of three months before the requested occupancy.
E/4.6
Where a NOMS booking does not require a TTRO, it shall be submitted to National Highways between
three months and three weeks before the requested occupancy.
E/4.7
All existing NOMS bookings shall be confirmed to National Highways at least three weeks before the
date of the occupancy in the format prescribed in the NOP.
NOTE
NOMS booking requests for works that are not high impacting works, submitted less than three weeks
before the planned occupancy, still require approval and are processed subject to their impact on other
occupancy bookings.
E/4.7.1
NOMS bookings for works which cannot be combined with other works, or do not have any flexibility
with regard to delivery date, should be submitted as soon as the works programme is determined.
E/4.7.2
Approved bookings should not be amended within two weeks of the occupancy unless such changes
are due to unforeseeable circumstances including weather and incidents.
NOTE
Poor planning of resources is not considered to be an unforeseeable circumstance.
E/4.8
Any clashes between NOMS bookings shall be identified and communicated to the works promoter.
E/4.8.1
Clashes should be identified at the earliest possible opportunity to avoid abortive work and maximise
the opportunity for combining of works.
E/4.9
Where a clash has been identified in NOMS and communicated, the clash shall:
1)
be resolved by the works/activity promoter(s) and approved by National Highways; or
2)
be escalated using the requirements in section E/4.35 (Escalation).
E/4.10
Where a clash has been identified in NOMS, no works shall take place until the clash has been
resolved and the resolution approved by National Highways.
Confirmation of work
E/4.11
Confirmation that high impacting works are to take place during the authorised occupancy shall be
made to National Highways at or before the times listed below, except where, in exceptional
circumstances, the works are amended due to safety, an incident or weather conditions, which could
not have been reasonably foreseen at the notification times:
1)
12.00 hrs on the day of the closure for closures between 19.00 hrs and 24.00 hrs;
2)
12.00 hrs on the day preceding the closure for closures between 00.01 hrs and 19.00 hrs.

This form is to be used where approval is required for relaxations to occupancy requirements. This
includes relaxations to Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 requirements in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 9.N]for
length and spacing of works and speed limit reductions greater than 20 mph. As per Traffic Signs
Manual: Chapter 8, the risks associated with the design and operation of road works are SFAIRP. This
form cannot be used for safety relaxations, as the responsibility remains the remit of the principal
