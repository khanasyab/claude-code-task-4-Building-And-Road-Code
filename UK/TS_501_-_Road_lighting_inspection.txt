Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document contains the inspection and assessment road lighting requirements of the Overseeing
Organisation.
The purpose of inspection is to detect lighting failures and other defects.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.
Inspection of other highway systems can complement, and be carried out in conjunction with, road
lighting inspections. These systems include illuminated signs, bollards, etc and can be integrated into
their inspection activities..

Category 3
(Low priority)
All other electrical defects, lighting failures and
structural faults which are considered to be less critical
