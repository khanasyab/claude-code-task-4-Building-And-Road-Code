Competence
A person with the appropriate level of knowledge, training,
experience and skill to make risk based decisions on the chosen
subject matter.
Emergency area
On smart motorways, an area to the side of the carriageway where
drivers can stop in an emergency and in which maintenance
vehicles can stop when carrying out work in the vicinity of the
emergency area.
Hard shoulder
The hard shoulder is the lane clear of main line traffic provided
adjacent to the nearside of a dual carriageway road that offers a
place for vehicles to stop in emergencies and in which authorised
vehicles can be parked during routine maintenance operations.
High speed dual carriageway
A dual carriageway road which is subject to a permanent speed
limit of 50mph or more.
Lane below signal 1
On smart motorways - hard shoulder running, the lane on the
nearside (left) of the carriageway adjacent to the verge, equivalent
to the hard shoulder on a conventional motorway.
NOTE: Lane below signal 1 can be either subject to controlled use
as a running lane (hard shoulder running) or be permanently
converted to a running lane (all lane running).
Lateral clearance
The lateral clearance is the distance measured horizontally
between the edge of the working space or vehicle and the edge of
the carriageway in use by main line traffic, as defined by the Traffic
Signs Manual Chapter 8 ( TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 5.N]).
Live lane
A traffic lane that does not form part of the works area or safety
zone. Unless signing advises to the contrary, the hard shoulder is
not classified as a live lane.
Maintenance hardstanding
/ Maintenance access area
A designated area for maintenance activity, usually consisting of a
section of verge that has been reinforced to provide a location off
the carriageway/hard shoulder in which authorised vehicles can be
parked during maintenance operations.
Personnel
Any person under the direction and control of those responsible for
undertaking work activities on the road network.
Short, medium and long
duration stops on the
hard shoulder
The following definitions apply to any work activity that requires a
vehicle to stop at the side of a high-speed road:
1) short duration; up to 15 minutes;
2) medium duration; up to 90 minutes;
3) long duration; over 90 minutes.
Smart motorway
- all lane running

E/1. Planning issues
E/1.
Planning issues
E/1.1
Before carrying out any work, all risks associated with the work activity shall be assessed and used to
select a method of work that results in risk that is ALARP for all parties affected.
E/1.2
A suitable and sufficient risk assessment must be undertaken and appropriately documented by a
competent person, who is responsible for planning and carrying out the work in accordance with Health
and Safety at Work Act HASAWA 1974 c.37 [Ref 1.N] & Management of Health and Safety at Work
Regulations MHSWR 1999, Section 3 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
For the purpose of this document, 'suitable and sufficient risk assessment' is defined within GG 104
[Ref 1.I], which sets out the framework and approach for safety risk assessment to be applied when
undertaking any activity that does, or can have, an impact on safety on Highways England's motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads, either directly or indirectly.
E/1.3
An assessment shall be made to determine whether the site or location can be accessed safely without
the need to stop on the hard shoulder or verge, thus eliminating the risk associated with stopping.
E/1.4
Where the need to stop on the hard shoulder or verge cannot be eliminated, the assessment shall
determine:
1) how risk can be reduced;
2) whether workers can be isolated from risk of harm; and if not,
3) how risk can be controlled.
E/1.4.1
When undertaking work on the hard shoulder or roadside verge, vehicles should be parked off the
carriageway completely on the verge whenever possible, if there is an appropriate route for the vehicle
to access a suitable parking location safely without causing infrastructure or environmental damage.
E/1.4.2
Where vehicles cannot be parked off the carriageway, they should be parked on the hard shoulder or at
the side of the road, as far from live traffic as possible, in such a way to maximise the lateral clearance
between the vehicle and the trafficked carriageway, provided this can be achieved without causing
infrastructure or environmental damage.
E/1.5
The principles within the Traffic Signs Manual ( TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 5.N]) shall be applied in respect of
the safety zone or minimum lateral clearance required when working on the hard shoulder or verge.
E/1.5.1
A clearance of not less than 1.5m from the side of a vehicle to the edge of the trafficked carriageway
(representing a 0.3m access zone adjacent to the vehicle plus the required 1.2m minimum lateral
clearance between personnel and the nearest live lane) should be maintained when parked on the hard
shoulder or verge, in order to minimise the risk of impact from passing traffic.
E/1.5.2
An absolute minimum lateral clearance of 0.5m should be maintained between the nearest part of the
parked vehicle and edge of the trafficked carriageway in order to minimise the risk of impact from
passing traffic.
E/1.5.3
Where a safe lateral clearance cannot be achieved, other traffic management measures should be
assessed for their suitability and implemented accordingly.
E/1.5.4
For long duration stops on the hard shoulder, the closure of the hard shoulder (and where appropriate
the adjacent traffic lane) should be carried out in accordance with the guidance given in TSM Chapter 8
[Ref 5.N].
E/1.6
Information that helps to ensure the safety of those involved with the activity shall be provided to the
persons undertaking the works prior to commencement of the works.

Vehicle issues
E/2.1
In terms of conspicuity and lighting requirements, any vehicle undertaking short, medium or long
duration stops shall comply with the vehicle specifications given in the Traffic Signs Manual ( TSM
Chapter 8 [Ref 5.N]).
E/2.1.1
Subject to suitable site-specific risk assessment, when work activity is being undertaken on the hard
shoulder vehicles should be parked at least 18m but no more than 50m upstream of the works area.
E/2.1.2
When works are being carried out off the hard shoulder, but site conditions require vehicles to be 
parked on the hard shoulder, vehicles should be parked at least 3m downstream of a point adjacent to 
the location of personnel off the carriageway.
E/2.1.3
Vehicles should not be positioned so they are facing oncoming traffic when on the hard shoulder.
E/2.1.4
Beacons should be used in accordance with the following conditions:
1) when entering, leaving or moving on the hard shoulder or verge;
2) when travelling in traffic at a speed significantly less than the general speed of the traffic;
3) when approaching or leaving the site;
4) for all short duration stops and remain on at all times unless the vehicle is parked completely off the
carriageway;
5) for medium duration stops where no traffic management is required, remain on at all times unless
the vehicle is parked off the carriageway completely on the verge;
6) where traffic management to Figure E/4.1.10Na or Figure E/4.1.10b is required, switched off once
the traffic management is in place;
7) for all long duration stops, switched off when the vehicle is stationary.
E/2.1.5
Vehicle conspicuity and lighting should be maintained in good condition always by:
1) placing retro reflective tape on rear facing edges;
2) duplication of lighting clusters and beacons where standard lighting is obscured;
3) ensuring the cleanliness of conspicuity markings and lights.
E/2.2
The number of vehicles stopping/attending the site or location shall be kept to a minimum.
E/2.2.1
Placement of vehicles in the hard shoulder or verge should avoid restricting the sight-lines of passing
vehicles.

E/4. Traffic management
E/4.1.4
In situations where the provision of sufficient advance warning of the presence of road works and
personnel on the hard shoulder is compromised, the risk assessment should demonstrate that the risks
associated with providing alternative forms of advance warning are identified and mitigated in the risk
assessment.
E/4.1.5
Where the risk assessment indicates the requirement to provide an alternative form of advance
warning, the provision of traffic management as shown in Figure E/4.1.10b should be followed.
E/4.1.6
Whenever possible, vehicles should not stop on the hard shoulder where lateral clearances are less
than 0.5m and personnel are working on the hard shoulder or verge adjacent to or downstream of the
vehicle.
E/4.1.7
Where personnel are working on the hard shoulder or verge and the lateral clearance is less than 0.5m,
any assessment should assess the risks associated with stopping the vehicle at a place downstream of
the work location where a clearance greater than 0.5m can be achieved.
E/4.1.8
Where personnel are working on the carriageway and the works vehicle is parked a long distance
downstream from the work location, the risk assessment should assess the risks associated with the
reduced level of advanced warning provided by the works vehicle and provide mitigation as per E/4.1.4
above.
E/4.1.9
If the vehicle cannot be positioned in such a way that a lateral clearance greater than 0.5m can be
achieved or is possible, a risk assessment should be carried out to determine whether a Chapter 8 (
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 5.N]) closure of the hard shoulder and adjacent traffic lane is required.
