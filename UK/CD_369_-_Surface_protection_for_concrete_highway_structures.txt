2. Application of surface protection systems
2.9
Surface protection systems shall be clear, colourless and not impart a gloss finish to the treated areas
following application to the concrete substrate.
NOTE 1
Surface protection systems that are clear and colourless do not obscure surface defects present on the
underlying concrete substrate when the structure is inspected.
NOTE 2
Surface protection systems that do not impart a gloss finish to the treated areas mitigate against the
risk of graffiti vandalism.
2.10
Surface protection systems shall only be applied to concrete substrate surfaces that are free from
defects.
NOTE
Defects are any flaws in the concrete surface which might impair the application of the product its
coverage of the substrate such as air gaps, cracks, delamination and spalls.
2.11
Where defects are present on the existing concrete substrate, repairs shall be designed in accordance
with CS 462 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
Details for execution of repairs to existing concrete prior to application of surface protection systems
can be found in CC 484 [Ref 1.N].
2.12
Surface protection systems already present on the concrete substrate shall be removed prior to
application of new surface protection systems unless all of the following can be demonstrated:
1)
manufacturer's details of the existing surface protection system are available or the chemical
composition and performance of the system can be determined by testing;
2)
the existing surface protection system is intact without visual evidence of deterioration or damage;
3)
the performance of the combined new and existing coating layers has been tested; and
4)
the time elapsed since application of the existing coating does not exceed the manufacturer's
declared life expectancy of the system.
NOTE
Details of the performance required for a single anti-graffiti coating or combined new and existing
anti-graffiti coatings can be found in CC 482 [Ref 9.N].
2.12.1
Details of existing surface protection systems and any restrictions on the method of removing them
prior to the application of new surface protection systems should be described on the design drawings.
Anti-graffiti coatings
2.13
The need for the application of anti-graffiti coatings on new concrete structures or refurbishment of
existing concrete structures shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
2.13.1
Anti-graffiti coatings may be applied to concrete highways structures which:
1)
have proven or anticipated problem with graffiti;
2)
are located in sensitive areas as defined by the UKPGA 1980/66 [Ref 2.N] ;
NOTE
For requirements and advice on removal of graffiti from concrete see CS 462 [Ref 5.N].
2.14
Anti-graffiti coatings shall not be applied to concrete highway structures where the removal of graffiti or
reapplication of anti-graffiti coating presents an unacceptable health and safety risk to operatives in
accordance with GG 104 [Ref 6.N].
2.15
The need for the reapplication of anti-graffiti coatings on concrete highway structures shall be agreed
with the Overseeing Organisation.
2.15.1

2. Application of surface protection systems
2.15.2
Anti-graffiti systems should not be reapplied if:
1)
there is no evidence of recent graffiti; or
2)
the health and safety risks to maintenance operatives are no longer acceptable.
Anti-carbonation coatings
2.16
The need for the application of anti-carbonation coatings on new concrete structures or refurbishment
of existing concrete structures shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
New concrete structures exposed to the following situations can be more vulnerable to accelerated
carbonation:
1)
high concentration of carbon dioxide existing adjacent to the concrete, typically greater than
800ppm;
2)
relative humidity between 50 % and 70 % as described in CS CA55 [Ref 1.I];
3)
cementitious binder in the concrete mix containing a high proportion of cement replacement
material e.g. GGBS, fly ash, particularly where the original water-cement ratio of the concrete
was high.
2.16.1
Anti-carbonation coatings may be applied to existing concrete highway structures where:
1)
specialised remedial work such as electrochemical chloride removal has been undertaken;
2)
testing confirms that concrete carbonation has occurred to the depth associated with a high risk
of reinforcement corrosion as indicated in CS 462 [Ref 5.N].
2.17
The need for the reapplication of anti-carbonation coatings shall be agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation.
2.17.1

Materials for surface protection systems
Anti-graffiti coatings
3.1
Anti-graffiti coatings for treated areas of a concrete structure shall be specified to ensure that graffiti
can be removed without damage to the concrete substrate.
3.1.1
Anti-graffiti coatings may consist of the following:
1)
a non-sacrificial system that forms a hard and chemical resistant film; or
2)
a sacrificial system where the coating is removed along with the graffiti.
NOTE 1
Non-sacrificial anti-graffiti coating systems that form a hard and chemical resistant film are typically
rigid coating systems in accordance with BS EN 1504-2 [Ref 4.N]and have a high sheen finish,
however the high sheen finish typically does not impede inspection of the underlying concrete.
NOTE 2
Sacrificial anti-graffiti coatings are typically flexible coating systems in accordance with BS EN 1504-2
[Ref 4.N], which alter the natural appearance of the concrete substrate less compared with systems
forming a hard and chemical resistant film.
NOTE 3
Details of the performance required for anti-graffiti coatings applied can be found in CC 482 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE 4
Cleaning and removal of graffiti on sacrificial anti-graffiti coating systems can partially or fully remove
the anti-graffiti coating.
3.1.2
Hard and chemical resistant film anti-graffiti coating systems may be used where access to the
concrete substrate is difficult for application of anti-graffiti coatings and subsequent graffiti removal.
NOTE 1
The use of hard and chemical resistant film anti-graffiti coating systems in difficult to access locations
can avoid the need for reapplication of the anti-graffiti coating following graffiti removal.
NOTE 2
Examples of locations classifiable as 'difficult to access' for the application or reapplication of
anti-graffiti coatings include elements of a structure where specialist equipment or significant traffic
management is required.
3.1.3
Flexible anti-graffiti coating systems as defined in BS EN 1504-2 [Ref 4.N] may be used where the
concrete substrate is subject to movement or vibration that can adversely affect the durability of a rigid
anti-graffiti coating system.
3.2
Management of graffiti applied to concrete shall be in accordance with CS 462 [Ref 5.N].
3.2.1
Removal of graffiti from anti-graffiti coating systems using chemical cleaning agents should be agreed
with the Overseeing Organisation.
3.2.2
Overcoating using paints to obscure graffiti applied to concrete should only be used as a temporary
anti-graffiti solution.
NOTE
The use of anti-graffiti coatings is preferred over the use of temporary overcoating to obscure graffiti.
3.2.3
Overcoating of graffiti to temporarily obscure it should not be used in lieu of removing graffiti and
application to the cleaned concrete of an anti-graffiti coating in accordance with BS EN 1504-2 [Ref
4.N]unless the following conditions are met:
1)
the overcoating paint material complies with performance requirements of anti-graffiti coatings for
class I permeability to water vapour, capillary absorption and permeability to water and adhesion
strength by pull off test; and
2)
the colour and shade of the dry overcoating material matches the adjacent dry concrete.
NOTE
Details of performance required for anti-graffiti coatings applied to existing concrete can be found in CC
482 [Ref 9.N].
Anti-carbonation coatings
3.3
Anti-carbonation coatings shall be specified to protect the concrete structure against carbon dioxide
ingress and the consequential carbonation of the substrate.

3. Materials for surface protection systems
NOTE 1
Carbon dioxide can react to calcium hydroxide in the cement paste to lower the pH level of the concrete
and results in the breakdown of the reinforcement protective oxide layer, leading to possible corrosion.
NOTE 2
Details of the performance required for anti-carbonation coatings applied to existing concrete can be
found in CC 482 [Ref 9.N].
3.4
Where there is a need for anti-carbonation coatings to have crack bridging capabilities, the crack
bridging class of the anti-carbonation coatings in accordance with BS EN 1504-2 [Ref 4.N]shall be
recorded in the design outputs.
3.4.1
Crack bridging anti-carbonation coatings should be used where the concrete substrate is subject to
cyclic loading and vibrations.

Design outputs for surface protection systems for concrete highway structures
4.1
The design outputs for surface protection systems for concrete highway structures shall be in
accordance with Appendix C of CD 350 [Ref 10.N].
NOTE 1
Further details can be found in CD 350 [Ref 10.N]for the background to design outputs for hydrophobic
impregnation of concrete highway structures.
NOTE 2
The extent of application of surface protection systems proposed for the concrete structure in the
design outputs enable the quantity of surface protection system materials to be determined.
4.1.1
Trial panels greater than a minimum of 1600 mm length x 1600 mm width may be used where there is
need for greater confidence in the application and performance of the surface protection system.
NOTE 1
An example of where there is a need for greater confidence in application and performance of the
hydrophobic impregnation system is if a structure is located within a sensitive area.
NOTE 2
Trial panels for surface protection systems for new concrete structures are undertaken by casting and
treating concrete specimens with the same concrete mix, surface finish and orientation of the structural
element and/or its part in the permanent works that the trial panel is representing.
NOTE 3
Trial panels for surface protection systems for existing concrete structures are undertaken by treating
in-situ areas on the concrete surface of the existing structural element and/or its part that the trial panel
is representing.
