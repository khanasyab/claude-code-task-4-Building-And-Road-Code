Regulating course
Units
2.1
The units of measurement shall be:
a)
regulating course ............ tonne or cubic metre.
Measurement
2.2
The measurement of regulating course by tonne shall be calculated from the tonnage of material
certified by the Overseeing Organisation multiplied by the factor for the particular aggregate used.
2.3
The tonnage certified by the Overseeing Organisation shall be only that material included on delivery
tickets which is incorporated in the Permanent Works in the locations and to the extent and thickness
required by the Contract.
2.4
Material in excess of the requirements of the Contract and material used for any other purpose shall not
be included within the certified tonnage.
2.5
The measurement of regulating course by cubic metres shall be the volume of material measured to
the outlines required by the Contract.
Note
It is recommended that where a significant quantity of regulating material is anticipated to be required,
the regulating course be measured in cubic metres. Measurements by tonnage will only be used
exceptionally where there will be significant difficulties in measuring the volume.
Itemisation
2.6
Separate items shall be provided for regulating course in accordance with clauses 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of
GP 112 [Ref 2.N] and the following:
Table 2.6 Itemisation for Regulating course
Group
Feature
I
1 Each group or type of regulating course.
Note: Each item description which includes Group I Feature 1 shall relate to the tabulated list of the
different constituent aggregate types and their factors included in the Bill of Quantities.
Item Coverage - Regulating course
2.7
The items for regulating course shall be in accordance with clause 2.1 of GP 113 [Ref 1.N] and include
for:
a)

b)
weighing, tickets and copies.

Bond coat
Units
3.1
The unit of measurement shall be:
a)
bond coat ............ square metre.
Measurement
3.2
For the purposes of measurement any reference to bond coat shall be deemed to include tack coats.
3.3
Bond coat shall only be measured separately when the Contract requires a bond coat to be applied to
any existing (not new) bound substrate.
Note
Existing bound substrate can include planed or milled asphalt (inlay), un-planed or un-milled asphalt
(overlay) and rigid pavement construction whether planed or un-planed.
