GD 904 ENAA Revision 0
Introduction
Introduction
Background
Highways England as part of its Customer Service Strategy PR101/15 [Ref 2.I] is introducing this
standard to safely maximise the number of road works standard schemes designing to the highest safe
speed and to give advice on the use of 60mph temporary speed limits on our motorways.
The introduction of this standard serves to improve both the experience of our customers and
Highways England practices, whilst reiterating to all employees our responsibility to recognise the
importance of customers when developing new standards.
Recommendation six of the Transport Focus report Incidents and Roadworks 2016 [Ref 4.I] stated
"Highways England should set speed limits in roadworks no lower than is required to maintain safety".
This aligns to Highways England's ambition to continue improving the customer journey experience
when travelling on our network, as described in our Customer Service Strategy PR101/15 [Ref 2.I]
Highways England have completed an extensive series of trials where a temporary speed restriction of
60mph was implemented through several road works schemes. These studies have shown that a
speed restriction within road works can be managed to maintain the safety of road workers and road
users whilst having a positive effect to the road user. The benefits from these investigations include
improved journey times for road users, better speed compliance and a reduction in HGV close following
( Trial Reports [Ref 1.I]).
Temporary traffic management (TTM) should be designed to allow the highest safe speed to be
implemented in order to keep traffic flowing as freely as possible. However, appropriate safety risk
management and planning is required to ensure risks posed to road workers and road users are
effectively minimised.
This document identifies the requirements for standard schemes to design TTM to achieve Highways
England's objective of achieving the highest safe speed and to give advice on the use of 60 mph. This
demonstrates that Highways England is listening and responding to customers concerns by adapting
practices where possible, whilst maintaining the safety of road users and road workers alike.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

E/2.
Requirements for the safe use of highest safe speed limits
including advice on using 60mph at/through road works
General requirements
E/2.1
TTM on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads shall be designed to achieve the highest safe speed.
NOTE 1
Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N] gives guidance on the safe use of temporary
speed limits.
NOTE 2
Determining the highest safe speed is to be done in decrements of 10mph, TSM Chapter 8 TSM
Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N] Part 3 Appendix A1.8 gives further guidance on this.
NOTE 3
Table 3.5 in TSM Chapter 8 Part 1 is now replaced by Table A1.8 in TSM Chapter 8 Part 3 TSM
Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N]. Table A1.8 provides a criteria for the identification of design speeds for standard
schemes, though this criteria is not exhaustive or prescriptive.
E/2.2
The highest safe speed shall be informed by the safety risk assessment.
Safety requirements
E/2.3
The design of TTM shall be safe and efficient.
NOTE
The principles of "safe and efficient traffic management" are outlined within Traffic Signs Manual
Chapter 8 TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N].
E/2.4
TTM shall be designed to ensure the level of road user safety is no worse than when there are no road
works on the carriageway.
NOTE
The minimum requirements for road works are outlined in TSM Chapter 8 TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N].
E/2.5
Safe systems of work, including risk assessments, design review and design approval, shall be
followed when designing TTM.
NOTE
GG 104 [Ref 2.N] sets out the approach to be taken and is applied when undertaking any activity that
does or can impact on safety.
Highest safe speed requirements with advice on the use of 60 mph for standard
schemes
E/2.6
Standard scheme TTM on motorways, subject to the national speed limit, shall be designed to achieve
the highest safe speed.
E/2.6.1
For motorways subject to the national speed limit, where safe to do so, standard scheme TTM which
requires a speed restriction should be designed to a minimum speed of 60 mph.
NOTE
Guidance is available in Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N] and also
supplemented by case studies, hazard assessment(s) and additional guidance 60 mph limit through
roadworks [Ref 3.I].
E/2.7
For standard scheme TTM design with speed limits lower than the national speed limit evidence shall
be provided of the specific risks or hazards that justify the imposition of the reduced speed limit.
E/2.7.1
Where the same speed limit cannot be used across the entire phase of a scheme, standard scheme
TTM should be designed to ensure the highest safe speed is used for each section.
NOTE 1
When using varying speed limits in a scheme, the development of a suitable signing strategy using the
principles of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.N] can support road user comprehension.
NOTE 2
The use of TTM equipment with a higher performance can contribute to the safe design of a 60 mph
temporary speed limit at/through road works.
