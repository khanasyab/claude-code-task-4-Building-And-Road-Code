1.3
Permanent light-emitting variable message traffic signs shall comply with "Variable message signs and
signals for roadside technology and communications" in Section 8 of TC 131 [Ref 21.N].
Electrical installations for permanent traffic signs
1.4
Electrical installations for permanent traffic signs shall comply with "General requirements for electrical
work for road lighting and illuminated traffic signs" in Section 1 of TC 501 [Ref 3.N].

[Ref 10.N].
Asset and product identification labels for permanent traffic signs
1.6
Where the Overseeing Organisation has determined an asset identification label is required, a unique
asset identification label - i.e. the asset identification label provided in the WSR in each section of this
document - shall be affixed to each permanent traffic sign, unless otherwise stated in CC 120/WSR/001.
1.7
Product identification labels shall be affixed to permanent traffic signs as described in the referenced
standards in the following sections of this document.
E/1.8
Asset and product identification labels must be positioned on permanent traffic signs in accordance
with part 2 of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 ( UKSI 2016/362 [Ref 22.N]).

For a period of not less than ten years following installation or opening to traffic, whichever is later,
asset and product identification labels affixed to permanent traffic signs shall remain legible and, for
adhesive labels, not become detached or curled at the edges.
Verification for permanent traffic signs
1.10
Verification shall be undertaken for each permanent traffic sign with light-emitting or mechanical
components - e.g. flap signs, electromechanical variable message traffic signs, globes, flashing lights
- to confirm by testing that the permanent traffic sign is operating in accordance with the applicable
traffic signs regulations and the requirements of this document.
1.11
