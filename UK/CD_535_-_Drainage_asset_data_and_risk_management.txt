Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document defines the requirements for recording of inventory and condition of drainage assets,
and the management of flooding, pollution and cross-asset risks related to drainage.
Prior to this document, HD 43 set out the requirements for recording of drainage asset inventory
information. This was updated and supplemented by IAN 147, which set out advice for recording of
inventory and condition data for all types of drainage assets, and provided guidance for capturing this
data through surveys and digitisation of records.
This document formalises these requirements, and incorporates other drainage asset management
instructions and guidance that have been published prior to publication of this version.
National Application Annexes to this document provide further details of the scope and format of data,
and drainage asset management procedures specific to the Overseeing Organisation.
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 4.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] apply to this document.

Terms and definitions
Terms and definitions
In addition to the terms defined in the table below, drainage asset types are defined and described in
greater detail in Appendix A. Catchments and sub-catchments are described in greater detail in
Appendix B. Activities, activity sets, asset sets and components are described in greater detail in
Appendix C.
Term
Definition
Acute pollution
Incidence of pollution that occurs suddenly.
NOTE: A spill as a result of an accidental discharge from a
vehicle is a potential cause of an acute pollution incident.
Activity
Represents an action such as a survey that was carried out
on that asset on a specific date.
Activity set
Multiple activities, possibly on different dates, on multiple
assets.
Asset condition
A measure of the current health of an asset, that indicates
its ability to perform as designed and its likelihood of failure.
NOTE: Condition is considered in terms of serviceability
(service condition) and structural integrity (structural
condition).
Asset condition survey
Field surveys that assess the condition of all drainage
assets in an area at the asset level, without detailed
recording of defects.
NOTE: Where the assets have not been previously
recorded the survey also captures the asset inventory,
connectivity and flow direction between assets.
Asset inventory information
Data and information concerning the physical, permanent
characteristics of one or more assets.
NOTE 1: Asset inventory includes details of each asset
type, their parts, information about their permanent
characteristics such as materials and dimensions, and how
the assets connect together to form a drainage system.
NOTE 2: To satisfy connectivity requirements, some
records in the asset inventory can comprise network
modelling items.
Asset inventory survey
Quick field surveys that either identify the location of priority
drainage assets or confirm the validity of existing inventory
records.
NOTE: The surveys are selective and are unlikely to survey
100% of the assets in an area.
Asset set
Continuous assets that work together to provide the
functionality of a combined asset.
Basin
A depression in the ground that temporarily detains storm
water flows.
NOTE: The water can be directed to a surface water outfall,
or it can percolate through to groundwater.

======================================================================
CD 535 Version 1.2.0
Terms and definitions
(continued)
Chronic pollution
Incidence of pollution that occurs over a long period of time,
not from an individual incident.
NOTE: Long-term run-off from the carriageway can cause
chronic pollution.
Component
Components model the change in dimension, shape,
material or lining along a continuous asset.
Continuous asset
Asset such as a pipe, ditch or channel that is represented
as a linear feature in GIS.
NOTE: The GIS geometry represents the asset's
centre-line, and does not reflect its width.
Detailed defect survey
Detailed field surveys to record all condition defects in the
surveyed drainage assets.
NOTE 1: For pipework and chambers, this involves internal
CCTV survey. For non-pipework assets, it involves detailed
survey, possibly with selective excavation of some buried
assets.
NOTE 2: Where the asset inventory has not previously
been recorded, or has not been recorded in detail, then the
detailed inventory is also captured.
NOTE 3: The survey can focus on particular assets in an
area of known performance problems, or can survey all the
drainage assets in the area, in which case the survey also
records how the assets connect together and flow
directions.
Diffuse pollution
Incidence of pollution involving pollutants from several
sources, over a long period of time, rather than from an
individual incident.
NOTE: Individually, the pollutants involved can have no
significant impact on water quality, but at a catchment scale
and/or in combination can become significant.
Drainage asset
An individual item within a drainage system, such as a gully,
pipe, ditch or pond.
Drainage data management system
(DDMS)
Overseeing Organisation's master database for managing
information concerning drainage assets and flooding.
Drainage catchment
A group of all the drainage systems and the adjacent land
they drain, between two geographical high points of the
highway network.
NOTE 1: Both carriageways of a dual carriageway are
considered part of the same catchment, but risks can be
assessed separately for each carriageway (see drainage
sub-catchment).
NOTE 2: A drainage catchment can include one or more
drainage systems.
Drainage sub-catchment
The separate carriageways of a drainage catchment, used
primarily for flood risk assessment.
NOTE: Sub-catchments can contain multiple systems.

CD 535 Version 1.2.0
Terms and definitions
(continued)
Drainage surveys
Detailed field investigations that are drainage specific, are
mainly carried out on foot, generally by drainage survey
specialists in accordance with CS 551 [Ref 5.N].
Drainage system
A group of drainage assets that are directly or indirectly
connected to each other, within a single drainage
catchment.
NOTE 1: Each individual drainage asset is part of only one
drainage system.
NOTE 2:Systems can cross sub-catchments within the
same catchment.
Flooding
The accumulation or passage of water at the ground surface
where it is not normally experienced.
Flood
A single incidence of flooding on or within 200 m of a
carriageway or within 500 m of a drainage asset, at a
particular location and time.
Flooding hotspot
An arbitrary extent of carriageway at risk of repeating
flooding
Mitigation
An action or procedure that is designed and implemented to
reduce a risk to an acceptable level.
NOTE 1: A mitigation does not necessarily eliminate a risk
entirely.
NOTE 2: Acceptability criteria for the level of residual risk
can be defined on a case-by-case basis.
Network modelling item
An asset inventory record that takes the place of one or
more physical point asset or continuous asset records to
satisfy drainage network connectivity requirements.
NOTE: Example usages are where there is either no
physical asset, where the detailed arrangement of the
physical assets are not yet known, or where flow direction is
generalised in a region asset. Further details and examples
are given in Appendix A.
Point asset
An asset such as a chamber that is represented as a point
in GIS.
NOTE 1: The dimensions or physical shape of the asset are
not represented in the GIS geometry, but only as data
attributes.
NOTE 2: Some assets of a linear physical shape such as
weirs are represented as point assets because the overall
flow direction is across their width, rather than along their
length.

Terms and definitions
(continued)
Pollution
The presence or introduction of a substance that can have
an adverse impact on the environment, over a short or long
period, regardless of cause and whether this is accidental or
deliberate.
NOTE: Pollution can affect environmental factors such as
air quality, noise, water quality, visual impacts, etc; only
water quality impacts are within the scope of this document.
Pollution incident
An incidence of pollution at a specific location, either on an
acute or chronic basis.
Pond
A depression in the ground with a permanent water body.
Priority asset register
Flooding or pollution risk assessment information for all
priority assets, recorded in the DDMS in addition to the
asset's inventory and condition information.
Priority asset
Drainage assets that present a risk of pollution or flooding
i.e. all outfalls, soakaways and culverts.
Region asset
Asset such as a pond or basin that is represented as a
closed polygon in GIS.
NOTE: The GIS geometry reflects its physical boundary.
Repeated flooding
The occurrence of at least two floods within a rolling
five-year period, on the same sub-catchment.
Service condition
The performance of an asset and severity of the defects that
affect its serviceability, independent of its structural
condition.
NOTE: Service defects are addressed by maintenance of
the asset such as cleansing or vegetation clearance.
Spill
A single spillage on, or within 200 m of, the carriageway, at
a particular location and time.
NOTE: A spill does not necessarily result in the occurrence
of a pollution incident.
Structural condition
The condition of the fabric of the asset and the severity of
defects that affect its integrity.
NOTE: Structural defects are addressed by repairing or
replacing the asset.
Sub-catchment flood risk

Drainage surveys shall be undertaken to collect asset inventory and condition data to systematically
develop drainage schemes, and wider schemes that have a drainage element, in accordance with the
Overseeing Organisations standard business processes.
2.3.1
The Overseeing Organisation's standard business processes for scheme development may include the
following stages during which a drainage survey is undertaken:
1)
feasibility study;
2)
preliminary design;
3)
detailed design; and
4)
pre-construction.
2.4
A post-construction survey shall be undertaken following completion of a scheme to:
1)
capture as-built inventory and condition data;
2)
update the Overseeing Organisations DDMS; and,
3)
confirm that design and construction contractual requirements have been met.
2.5
A post-construction survey shall be undertaken following completion of the drainage works and
following completion of works to other assets that could damage the newly installed or renewed
drainage.
NOTE 1
This is to ensure that the as-built inventory and condition data collected is a true reflection at handover
into operation and maintenance.
NOTE 2
If construction work continues following the completion of the drainage works, damage can occur to
new or renewed drainage assets due to overrun by vehicles and plant.

3. Asset inventory data
3.3
Drainage asset field surveys shall be carried out in accordance with the detailed requirements given in
CS 551 [Ref 5.N].
3.4
Where traffic management is required to safely undertake a field survey, this shall be in accordance
with TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 8.N].
3.5
Each physical drainage asset shall be recorded only once in the DDMS.
NOTE 1
Where an asset already recorded in the DDMS is resurveyed, the existing record is updated rather than
adding a new record.
NOTE 2
Where the condition of an asset has been surveyed more than once and the DDMS permits records for
multiple surveys to be held, then these are all related to the same single asset inventory record, and the
most recent condition information is indicated.
3.6
Each drainage asset recorded in the DDMS shall be assigned to one drainage sub-catchment.
3.7
Where asset inventory data is not derived from a field survey, the inventory records shall be marked as
"unvalidated" until they have been validated by a field survey.
3.7.1
A field validation survey may cover a representative sample of point assets to determine the overall
reliability of the records used to derive the data.
3.7.2
In addition to validation surveys, the inventory data may be validated during any other type of field
survey, such as an asset condition survey.
3.8
As-built drawings, record status reports and signed design certificates shall be provided in accordance
with the requirements of the National Application Annexes.
Asset type
3.9
Each drainage asset shall have its asset type identified and recorded.
NOTE 1
A brief definition of each asset type is provided in Appendix A.
NOTE 2
Drainage asset type codes, and further detailed descriptions of asset types are provided in the National
Application Annexes.
3.10
At the location where drainage discharges to a third party system, watercourse, the sea, or otherwise
leaves the responsibility of the Overseeing Organisation, an outfall shall be recorded.
NOTE 1
Outfalls can occur at a physical asset, such as an outlet from a pipe, or at a location where there is no
physical asset such as a point along a ditch.
NOTE 2
Requirements for the precedence of asset types, where more than one type asset type is applicable,
are given in this sub-section.
3.11
At the location where drainage discharges to the ground, a soakaway chamber, soakaway borehole,
soakaway trench or infiltration basin shall be recorded.
3.12
Where a drainage asset has more than one function and could be classified as one of several types, its
asset type shall be identified in the following descending order of precedence:
1)
soakaways, outfalls and culverts;
2)
any other asset types apart from standalone flow control devices and network modelling items;
3)
standalone flow control devices; and,
4)
network modelling items.
NOTE
Further guidance for specific asset types is provided in Appendix A.
3.13
Where an asset such as an outlet or standalone flow control device is located at an outfall location, its
asset type shall be recorded as an outfall.
3.14
Where there is no physical asset at the location of an outfall, its asset type shall be recorded as an
outfall.

Where an asset such as an outlet has a flow control device, but is not at an outfall location, its asset
type shall be recorded as an outlet. The nature of the flow control is recorded as part of the inventory
information.
3.16
Where a flow control device is not associated with another asset type, and is not at an outfall location,
its asset type shall be recorded as a standalone flow control device. The nature of the flow control is
recorded as part of the inventory information.

3. Asset inventory data
Asset location
3.18
The location of all drainage assets shall be recorded using the national grid, datum and transformation
according to the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Overseeing Organisation specific requirements on asset location are provided in the National
Application Annexes.
3.19
Where the level of an asset is recorded, this shall be to the datum determined by the Overseeing
Organisation.
3.20
Asset location shall be recorded to the minimum accuracy and stated to the precision given in Table
3.16 below, depending on the survey type.

NOTE
Where a measurement of relatively low accuracy is stated to a high precision, such as a GPS receiver
that outputs a location at a centimetre-level of precision but is only accurate to within +/-1 metre, stating
the full precision can give a misleading impression of the accuracy of the measurement.
3.20.1
For herringbone drains, the full geometric layout should be recorded as several connected continuous
assets, each classified as a counterfort drain.
Asset referencing
3.21
Each drainage asset shall be assigned a permanent asset reference that is unique across the entire
Overseeing Organisation's drainage asset base.
NOTE
A region asset and its associated region node are considered to be the same asset, and have the same
asset reference.
3.22
The permanent asset reference shall be assigned by the Overseeing Organisation's master DDMS,
when the asset is first recorded.
3.23
Any secondary systems that the Overseeing Organisation maintains that contain drainage data shall
derive that data from the master DDMS, including the permanent asset reference.
3.24
If a secondary system is used to edit or otherwise modify the drainage data, processes shall be in place
to update the asset data record held on the master DDMS using the permanent asset reference as the
link.
3.24.1
Assets may be assigned a local asset reference, which is:
1)
unique within a drainage catchment, except for a region asset and its associated region node;
2)
alphanumeric, containing at least one letter, such that the reference cannot be interpreted by
computer software as a numeric, date or time value; and,
3)
in a format that does not visually resemble the unique, national asset reference.
NOTE 1
Overseeing Organisation-specific requirements in the relevant National Application Annex define if a
local asset reference is optional or mandatory information.

3. Asset inventory data
NOTE 2
Computer software can modify and reformat numeric, date and time values, or text strings that it can
interpret as such, either during data production or subsequently. This leads to incorrect asset
references and can break connectivity between assets. For example:
1)
values such as "001" can be modified, in this case to "1";
2)
values such as "10/02" or "10-2" can be interpreted as dates, modified and variably formatted, in
this case to 10th February or 2nd October of the current year;
3)
values such as "10:2" or "10:02" can be interpreted as times, modified and variably formatted, in
this case to "10:02:00";
4)
values such as "1E3" can be interpreted as numeric and modified, in this case to "1000" or
"1,000".
3.25
Asset references, whether manually or system assigned, shall not contain space characters.
3.25.1
The underscore character may be used in asset references instead of a space.
3.26
Asset references, whether manually or system assigned, shall be retained during all subsequent
updates of the asset record.
Activity and activity sets
Activity
3.27
Activities shall be linked to assets.
3.27.1
An activity may be:
1)
a survey that updates the asset information of existing assets, finds new assets or finds assets
that are no longer present;
2)
a repair or refurbishment that changes the asset inventory and/or condition;
3)
a renewal that creates a new asset; or,
4)
a data management activity such as archiving the asset record.
3.28
Each activity shall be linked to one asset only.
3.28.1
An asset may have a history of multiple activities over time.
3.29
Each activity shall be linked to one activity set.
Activity set
3.30
Activity sets shall contain at least one activity.
3.30.1
Activity sets may be comprised of multiple activities, on different dates, on multiple assets.
3.30.2
An activity set may contain different types of activities, although there will be some commonality such
as the contractor or user carrying out the activity, the period of time, or a consistent asset or other entity.
NOTE
An example scenario of activities and activity sets is provided in Appendix C.
Asset sets
3.31
Continuous assets that work together to provide the functionality of a combined asset shall be recorded
as separate assets but linked together by an asset set.
3.31.1
The assets may be managed and maintained separately.
NOTE
An example scenario of an asset set is provided in Appendix C.
Components
3.32
Continuous assets shall have associated components that model when a significant change in the
asset occurs, such as changes in dimensions, materials, shape or lining.

3. Asset inventory data
NOTE
Any change to one (or more) of these attributes defines the start of a new component within the asset.
3.33
Components shall not overlap.
3.34
Components shall be contiguous along the full length of the asset.
3.35
Each component shall be linked to one activity.
NOTE
Example scenarios of continuous asset components are provided in Appendix C.
Connectivity and flow direction
Point assets
3.36
Each point asset shall be connected to at least one continuous asset.
Continuous assets
3.37
Each continuous asset shall have one associated point asset located at each of its ends.
3.37.1
A single point asset may have any number of continuous assets connecting with them.
3.38
The flow direction of all continuous assets shall be indicated by recording one of the associated point
assets as the upstream asset and the other as the downstream asset.
NOTE
A single point asset can be the upstream point asset of one or more continuous assets, and the
downstream point asset of one or more other continuous assets.
3.39
The flow direction shall be recorded as the drainage system was designed, and as it would function
under conditions within design criteria.
NOTE
Flow direction can be temporarily reversed in some drainage assets under surcharge or other
exceptional conditions.
3.40
The certainty of the connectivity and flow direction shall be recorded in the inventory information for all
continuous assets.
3.41
Continuous assets shall be split into two separately recorded, but contiguous, assets where there is an
intermediate flow control device in the asset.
NOTE
Where there is an intermediate flow control device, a flow control device asset is recorded at the ends
of the two continuous assets in the location where the split was made, and hence the two parts of the
original continuous asset will be in the same drainage system.
3.42
Continuous assets shall be split into two separately recorded non-contiguous assets at a watershed at
the boundary between two catchments.
NOTE
Where there is a watershed, separate ghost nodes are recorded at the ends of the two continuous
assets in the location where the split was made, and hence the two parts of the original continuous
asset will be in separate drainage systems.
Additional requirements for continuous assets with intermediate connections
3.43
Where a continuous asset has one or more incoming assets connecting part way along it, the
continuous asset shall not be split into multiple assets.
3.44
Where a continuous asset has one or more incoming assets connecting part way along it, the point
asset at the farthest upstream end of the continuous asset shall be recorded as the upstream asset.
NOTE
An example scenario of a continuous asset with intermediate incoming assets is provided in Appendix
A.
3.45
Where a continuous asset has one or more outgoing assets connecting part way along it, the
continuous asset shall be split into multiple assets.

3. Asset inventory data
NOTE
An example scenario of a continuous asset with intermediate outgoing assets, is where inlets are
located along a channel.
Region assets
3.46
Each region asset shall have one associated region node point asset located at its geometric centroid
that is used to define connectivity.
3.46.1
Where the geometric centroid lies outside the perimeter of the region asset, the region node location
should instead be defined within the perimeter.
NOTE
The geometric centroid only lies outside the perimeter of a region asset where it is of a highly irregular
shape.
3.47
The association between the region node and region asset shall be defined by assigning the same
asset reference to both.
NOTE 1
The only scenario when it is acceptable to have two asset records with the same asset reference within
a single catchment, is a region asset and its associated region node.
NOTE 2
Where local asset references are assigned, these are also the same for the region asset and
associated region node.
3.48
Each region asset shall be connected to the rest of the drainage network at its associated region node,
by at least one region connector to represent inwards flow and, with the exception of infiltration basins,
one region connector to represent outwards flow.
NOTE
Infiltration basins discharge to the ground over their full extent rather than at a specific point.
3.49
Region connectors shall connect the region node at one end, and a point asset at the location of the
inflow or outflow as applicable at the other.
3.49.1
Where there is no physical asset at the inflow or outflow location, the point asset type should be
assigned as a ghost node.
NOTE 1
To satisfy connectivity requirements of continuous assets, the region connector is connected to the
region node point asset, as a proxy for the associated region asset.
NOTE 2
An example usage of region assets, region nodes and region connectors is provided in Appendix A.
NOTE 3
The inflow or outflow point is normally located on the perimeter of the region asset, but can be located
within it to accurately record the inflow or outflow location.
Use of phantom nodes and phantom connectors
3.50
Where the nature of the drainage asset is not known beyond a point along a continuous asset, a
phantom node point asset shall be recorded at that location.
3.51
Where the nature of the drainage asset between two point assets is not known but connectivity
between them is expected, a phantom connector continuous asset shall be recorded between the two
point assets.
3.51.1
A single phantom connector may represent either a single physical continuous drainage asset or
multiple drainage assets of various types.
NOTE
The point assets at each end of a phantom connector have their actual asset type recorded, and are
not recorded as phantom nodes.

Asset condition data
4.1
Where the condition of an asset is to be recorded, the asset shall also have its inventory recorded in
accordance with Section 3.
4.2
The condition of drainage assets shall be assessed separately in terms of structural condition and
service condition.
4.3
Asset condition shall be assessed either at an asset level, or by recording separate structural and
service defects (defect level) which are then aggregated to asset level.
NOTE 1
Either condition assessment approach is intended to result in the same condition grades, with the asset
level approach being quicker, and the defect level approach providing additional detail and accuracy.
NOTE 2
Selection of the approach to condition assessment depends on the survey methodology used.
Asset-level condition assessment
4.4
Where condition is assessed at asset level, structural condition and service condition shall be graded in
accordance with the criteria in Table 4.4, except where the Overseeing Organisation provides more
prescriptive data.

Where assessment of an asset's condition was attempted but not possible, e.g. visibility or access
obstructed by extensive vegetation, the condition grade(s) that could not be assessed are recorded as
9.
NOTE 2
Where the service condition of an asset could not be assessed due to a structural defect, such as a
seized cover, the structural grade is assessed if possible and recorded as 1 to 5, and a service grade of
9 is recorded.
NOTE 3
Where assessment of an asset's condition was intended but not possible due to practicalities such as a
lack of suitable traffic management or VRS over an access cover, the condition grade(s) that could not
be assessed are recorded as 0.
Defect-level condition assessment
4.5
All defects and observations shall be linked to one activity.
4.6
Where asset condition is assessed at defect level, the structural grade and service grade shall be
determined in accordance with the criteria in Table 4.6a and Table 4.6b.

NOTE 2
For continuous assets, the mean service score is defined as the sum of all service defect level scores,
divided by the length of the asset in metres.
4.6.1
Where the DDMS provides functions to determine defect scores and/or calculate the resultant
structural grade and service grade, these scores and grades should not be manually calculated.
NOTE
Any manual calculations can be overridden by the DDMS, to ensure consistency of scoring and grading.
4.6.2
Where a defect level assessment is carried out on an asset but no structural defects are found, an
appropriate observation to indicate the asset is free from structural defects should be recorded.
NOTE
Where there are no structural defects in an asset, its structural grade is 1.
4.6.3
Where a defect level assessment is carried out on an asset but no service defects are found, an
appropriate observation to indicate the asset is free from service defects should be recorded.

5.10
Where an extent of carriageway is at risk of repeated flooding, the risk shall be assessed and recorded,
either as a flooding hotspot or as sub-catchment flood risk.
NOTE
Where an Overseeing Organisation has specific requirements on how to record an extent of
carriageway at risk of repeated flooding, this is provided in the National Application Annexes.
Flooding hotspots
5.11
Where flood risk is to be managed through flooding hotspots, they shall be recorded on the DDMS.
NOTE
The minimum extent of a flooding hotspot is typically delimited by adjacent junctions, or the extent of
carriageway that a diversion route avoids, around the specific flooding location(s).
5.11.1
Each carriageway of a dual carriageway may be treated as separate flooding hotspots, for separate
flood risk assessment.
5.11.2
A flooding hotspot may be identified where a single high-impact flood event has occurred.
5.12
Where the DDMS does not automatically identify potential flooding hotspot locations, they shall be
manually identified based on flood records.
NOTE
Overseeing Organisation specific requirements and criteria for defining flooding hotspots are provided

6. Managing risks to water quality
6.
Managing risks to water quality
General requirements
6.1
The drainage asset must be managed in accordance with the European Community Directive
2000/60/EC [Ref 3.N] to:
1)
prevent the deterioration of the status of all types of surface water and groundwater bodies; and,
2)
support the protection, enhancement and restoration of all bodies of surface water and
groundwater.
NOTE 1
The legislation which translates this directive into law is given in the National Application Annexes of LA
113 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 2
Pollution of water bodies can occur either due to:
1)
short-term incidents at a specific location that cause acute pollution, such as accidental spills
from vehicles; or,
2)
carriageway run-off over a longer period of time or wider geographical area, causing chronic or
diffuse pollution.
Outfalls and soakaways
6.2
In addition to the drainage asset inventory and condition data, registers of outfalls and soakaways shall
be maintained.
NOTE
Assessment and mitigation procedures, risk assessment criteria, and information recording
requirements for soakaways and outfalls are given in the National Application Annexes.
Recording spillage data
6.3
All spills on the highway network shall be recorded on the DDMS with the following information, within
24 hours of the spill's occurrence:
1)
location of the approximate centre of the spill using the national grid and transformation according
to the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation;
2)
date and time the spill was initially reported; and,
3)
whether the spill is affecting the carriageway and/or adjacent third party property.
NOTE
Overseeing Organisation-specific requirements on spill location are provided in the National Application
Annexes.
6.4
All information regarding a spill shall be recorded in the DDMS, within 28 days of its occurrence.
NOTE
Further information required to be entered regarding each spill is detailed in the relevant National
Application Annex.

7. Managing cross-asset risks
7.
Managing cross-asset risks
7.1
A cross-asset approach shall be taken to managing the risks caused by, and to, the drainage asset.
7.2
When determining the overall level of risk that a drainage asset causes, the drainage-related condition
of associated non-drainage assets shall be assessed, in addition to the condition of the drainage asset
itself.
7.2.1
Best practice advice in CIRIA C714 [Ref 1.I] should be followed when implementing processes for
managing the cross-asset risks related to drainage.
NOTE 1
As an example of assessment using non-drainage assets, the presence of hydrophilic vegetation on an
earthwork can indicate underperforming or insufficient drainage, even if the condition of the drainage
asset itself is good.
NOTE 2
Inadequate carriageway drainage resulting in slow removal of water from the pavement can lead to
premature failure of the pavement surface or formation layers, as well as the risks associated with
flooding.
7.3
Where improvement or remedial works are required on non-drainage assets, and these are partly or
wholly as a result of poor condition or insufficient drainage, these works shall include measures to
address the future cross-asset risk due to the drainage assets.
7.4
Works carried out to non-drainage assets shall be designed and implemented such that they do not
cause an adverse impact to the drainage asset.
NOTE
Potential adverse impacts to drainage assets due to work on other assets can include, for example:
1)
physical damage to drainage assets, for example, as a result of excavations or installation of
other assets such as VRS;
2)
changes to run-off characteristics such that existing drainage is unsuitable or of insufficient
capacity; or,
3)
release of foreign materials into the drainage system, above normal background amounts, which
might result in blockages, reduced capacity or risks to water quality.
7.5
Works carried out to drainage assets shall be designed and implemented such that they do not cause
an adverse impact on other assets.

Asset example usages
A2.1
Point assets - inlets and outlets
A2.1.1
Outfalls, inlets and outlets
Figure A.1 shows an example usage of an inlet, outlet and outfall. A ditch flowing into a culvert, to pass
underneath a road, would have an inlet at the upstream end of the culvert. As the culvert emerges from
beneath the road into another ditch, it would have an outlet. The ditch discharges into a third party river
and in this case does not have a physical structure. The ownership boundary (and the limit of the
Overseeing Organisation's responsibility) coincides with the river bank and this defines the outfall
location.
Figure A.1 Example use of inlets, outlets and outfalls
Points to note:
1)
If the ownership boundary had been midway between the carriageway and the river, then the
outfall would be at that location, not where the ditch physically discharges into the river.
2)
The outfall has the potential to pollute third party waters and like all outfalls is included within the
outfall register.
3)
If the connection between the culvert and the river had been piped, instead of a ditch, then the
outfall would also have been an outlet. Outlets are only priority assets where they are also
outfalls, in which case they would be included within the outfall register.
4)
Indicative highway ownership boundaries, and hence potential outfall locations, may be found in
mapping data sets available at www.gov.uk. Definitive ownership boundary information is
available from HM Land Registry www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry
5)
Where the ownership boundary is along a watercourse, under riparian law, the boundary would
be the centreline of the watercourse channel, although the discharge point into the third party
waters would be on the river bank.
A2.1.2
Grip inlets
Figure A.2 shows three examples of grip inlets, located along the crest of an embankment, each of
which allows drainage to be conveyed to the ditch at the toe of the embankment. The ditch is a single
asset that extends beyond the limits of the figure:
1)
The first grip inlet is at the upstream end of a "piped grip", which is recorded as a pipework asset
or gravity drain. The downstream end of the pipe connects part way along the ditch, and therefore
has a connector node that references the ditch. (See example use of connector nodes, below.)

Appendix A. Drainage asset types
2)
The second grip inlet is at the upstream end of a non-piped grip, which is recorded as a grip. In
this case, the grip does not extend all of the way to the ditch, but it has been established that
drainage will flow informally into the ditch, part way along it. The downstream end of the grip
therefore has a connector node that references the ditch. (See example use of connector nodes,
below.)
3)
The third grip inlet has no formal drainage downstream of it, and the drainage would therefore
flow informally down the embankment and into the ditch, part way along it. Therefore the grip
inlet references that it is connected to the ditch, similar to a connector node. (See example use of
connector nodes, below.)
Figure A.2 Example uses of grip inlets
A2.2
Drainage network modelling items
A2.2.1
Ghost nodes
A ghost node is a network modelling point item used to complete a drainage network by representing a
node that has no physical manifestation. The ghost node allows connectivity between assets to be
defined, by satisfying the requirement that all continuous assets have an upstream and downstream
point.
Example uses of ghost nodes include:
1)
the ends of ditches or other continuous assets where there is no physical point asset;
2)
at the connection between two surface assets such as a ditch and a pond, where there is no
physical asset such as a flow control device; and,
3)
at the connections between sections of a herringbone drain, where there is no physical asset.
A2.2.2
Connector nodes
A connector node is a network modelling point item representing an incoming intermediate connection
to a continuous asset. A connector node is located at the downstream end of the incoming asset.
Because it is at an intermediate location along the outgoing continuous asset, it is neither the upstream
nor downstream point asset of this continuous asset. The connector node has a connectivity reference
to associate it to the continuous asset that is downstream of it.
The connector node would normally be geographically located on its downstream continuous asset, but
need not be in all cases. Similarly, point assets where the path of connection is unknown (e.g. an
unknown gully connector) or informal (e.g. a grip inlet with no formal downstream drainage) can refer to
a downstream continuous asset, into which they would connect at an intermediate point.
Figure A.3 shows an example use of connector nodes. The example given above for grip inlets, also
shows example uses.

Appendix A. Drainage asset types
In the example below, there are three gullies ("GU1", "GU2" and "GU3") that are known to connect with
a single carrier pipe ("PW1"), at intermediate points along it. The carrier pipe has a manhole at its
upstream ("MH1") and downstream ends ("MH2"). The gullies are connected as follows:
1)
The connection between gully GU1 and the carrier pipe is unknown, as the gully connector and/or
connection has not been identified. GU1 therefore has a connectivity reference to the carrier pipe
as its downstream asset. No continuous asset is directly connected to GU1.
2)
GU2 is known to connect to the carrier pipe via a gully connector pipe "PW10", at a connection
located at the connector node "CN1". CN1 has a connectivity reference to the carrier pipe as its
downstream asset. The gully connector pipe PW10 has GU2 as its upstream asset, and CN1 as
its downstream asset.
3)
GU3 is similar to GU2, connected to the carrier pipe via a gully connector pipe "PW11" and
connector node "CN2". CN2 has a connectivity reference to the carrier pipe as its downstream
asset. The gully connector pipe PW11 has GU3 as its upstream asset, and CN2 as its
downstream asset.
Figure A.3 Example use of connector nodes
A2.2.3
Phantom nodes
A phantom node is a network modelling point item that provides an upstream or downstream end point
of a drainage system, when the nature of the drainage system beyond the phantom node is unknown,
because either there are no as-built drawings or it has not been surveyed.
Once information is available, phantom nodes should be replaced with the correct asset information.
Figure A.4 shows an example use of a phantom node, when deriving asset data from incomplete
drawings. The dashed line indicates the limit of available information.
Figure A.4 Example incomplete asset inventory with phantom node
A2.2.4
Phantom connectors
A phantom connector is a network modelling continuous item that represents a connection between
two known point assets in which the route of the continuous connection between them is unknown, but
there is some degree of certainty that the two are connected. A phantom connector can be used if an
area of an as-built drawing is obscured, or where a below ground pipework survey has not been carried
out but the pipework route can be established with some degree of certainty, for example by dye tracing.

Appendix A. Drainage asset types
A single phantom connector can represent several assets in reality. This is distinct from other types of
continuous asset with uncertain connectivity, where the nature of the item is otherwise known.
Once information is available, phantom connectors should be replaced with the correct asset
information.
Figure A.5 and Figure A.6 show an example usage of a phantom connector where part of the source
information is unavailable, but connectivity is expected.

Figure A.6 Example incomplete asset inventory with phantom connector
A2.2.5
Region connectors and region nodes
A region connector is a network modelling continuous item that represents the flow of drainage through
a region asset such as a pond. It connects the associated region node at the centre of the region asset
to either an inflow or outflow point, which is normally on the perimeter of the pond but can be within it.
Each region asset should normally have at least one region connector for the inflow and, with the
exception of infiltration basins that solely drain to the ground, one for the outflow.
An example arrangement of a region node, region asset and region connectors is shown in Figure A.7.
The region asset has two incoming continuous assets: a pipe and a ditch; and one outgoing continuous
asset: a channel. Where the pipe ends at the pond, there is an outlet because the drainage system is
changing from sub-surface to open. There is no physical asset where the ditch enters the pond, but to
satisfy connectivity requirements, there needs to be a point asset at the end of the ditch, so this will be
a ghost node. Where the pond flows into the channel there is a weir, which is represented by a flow
control device point asset. Region connectors join the region node to each point where a continuous
asset enters or leaves the region asset.

Drainage catchment definition
Drainage catchment extents align to the geographical high points along the network. Figure B.1 shows
an idealised catchment where all drainage systems between the geographical high points at either end
of the road section shown will drain to the watercourse at the low point in the catchment.
Figure B.1 Catchment definition

Drainage catchment model
The drainage catchment model is a topologically equivalent 2D representation of the 3D catchment
shown in Figure B.1. The catchments are to be modelled as a linear model, aligning to the Overseeing
Organisation's road network model. Each drainage catchment is made up of one or more
sub-catchments, representing the separate sides of the carriageway or junctions. An example
catchment model for a single carriageway is shown in Figures B.2 and an example catchment model
for a dual carriageway is shown in Figure B.3.

Activity and activity set example
An activity represents an action, such as a survey, that was carried out on a single specific drainage
asset on a specific date. Multiple activities, possibly on different dates, on multiple assets are grouped
together into activity sets.
Figure C.1 shows a schematic example in which a contractor has undertaken a number of activities on
four drainage assets as follows:
1)
the point asset was surveyed on the 1st February resulting in its inventory and/or condition data
being updated;
2)
continuous asset 1 was also surveyed on the 1st February resulting in its inventory and/or
condition data being updated;
3)
continuous asset 2 had some maintenance carried out on it on 1st February resulting in its
inventory and/or condition data being updated; and,
4)
the region asset was surveyed on 2nd February resulting in its inventory and/or condition data
being updated.
The updates to the four drainage assets above are submitted as one package of data to the DDMS for
import. Figure C.1 shows the modelled four activities, on the four drainage assets, grouped together by
the one activity set within the DDMS after data import.

Asset set example
Asset sets are continuous assets that work together to provide the functionality of a combined asset.
Asset sets apply to the following continuous asset types when paired with a filter pipe asset:
1)
filter drain;
2)
counterfort drain;
3)
narrow filter drain;
4)
soakaway trench; and,
5)
linear cellular storage system.
Each asset is combined into an asset set with its associated filter pipe asset by matching the shared
upstream and downstream point assets to indicate that they work together.
Figure C.2 shows a schematic example, in cross section, of two assets, filter drain "FD1" and filter pipe
"FP1", that both run between the same two catchpit point assets "CP1" and "CP2". Although the filter
drain and filter pipe remain two separate assets for survey, maintenance and record purposes, they are
grouped together in the DDMS into asset set "FD1_FP1" so that the functionality of the combined asset
is recorded.

Component examples
Components model changes in one or more of the following attributes along the length of a continuous
asset:
1)
dimension (diameter in the case of a pipe, or width and/or depth in the case of a ditch);
2)
material;
3)
shape; or,
4)
lining.
Where a continuous asset does not have any changes in the relevant attributes along its length, it will
have only one associated component as shown in Figure C.3.

E/3. Managing flooding and pollution risk
NOTE 1
Factors such as whether the live carriageway is affected, the duration of impact, the safety impact or
whether any other National Highways assets are being damaged do not come into the definition of a
flood. Such matters are considered in the assessment of the impact when reporting a flood on the
GDMS. The flood is a "near miss" if the live carriageway is not impacted, but it is still recorded as a
flood on the GDMS.
NOTE 2
Where the sub-catchment risk status is C or D the sub-catchment is not a priority for mitigation works,
however, opportunities for mitigation are to be considered in association with other works being carried
out in the sub-catchment.
E/3.10
The following design requirements shall be taken as defining a flood:
1)
any standing or flowing water that extends beyond the CD 526 [Ref 10.N] requirements of:
a)
1.5m from the kerb for the hard shoulder; or,
b)
1.0m from the kerb for the hard strip;
2)
any standing water at pedestrian, cycle or equestrian crossings contrary to the requirements of
CD 526 [Ref 10.N];
3)
any surcharge of water onto the carriageway adjacent to the central reserve contrary to the
requirements of CG 501 [Ref 2.N]; or,
4)
any surcharge of water into the running lane from adjacent surface water channels contrary to the
requirements of CG 501 [Ref 2.N].
E/3.10.1
The following may be used to distinguish between a flood and a puddle:
1)
water depth estimated to be more than 30 mm; or
2)
one or more wheel tracks affected irrespective of water depth; or
3)
third party land or property affected; and,
4)
flood area estimated to be 10 m2 or more.
NOTE
Photographic examples of what is and what is not defined as a flood are given in Appendix E/A.
E/3.11
Flooding that is located on or within 200 m of the carriageway or within 500 m of a drainage asset shall
be recorded on the GDMS as a flood.
E/3.12
The location of all floods shall be recorded to OSGB36 datum, using the OSTN15 transformation model.
NOTE
Where the location of the flood is recorded as a relative location, such as a marker post chainage, this
is in addition to the location as OS coordinates.
E/3.13
The severity of floods shall be quantified in accordance with the flood severity index (FSI) definition,
which can be downloaded from the GDMS.
NOTE 1
The GDMS automatically calculates the flood severity index from the information entered for each flood.
NOTE 2
A flood receives an FSI score even if the carriageway is not affected.
NOTE 3
A flood receives an FSI score even if the duration of impact is less than 15 minutes.
NOTE 4
The only way that a flood can receive an FSI of 0 is if it cannot be snapped to the Linear Network Model
on the GDMS as it is more than 200 m from the carriageway and more than 500 m from a drainage
asset, and is therefore not classed as a flood.
E/3.14
The nature of any impacts of a flood on third parties or other assets shall be assessed and recorded on
the GDMS.
E/3.15
The flood and arising mitigation actions shall be logged within the operational management system
within 24 hours as detailed in the ADMM [Ref 1.N].
E/3.16
All floods shall be entered into the GDMS within 7 days as detailed in the ADMM [Ref 1.N].
E/3.17
Flood records shall be completed, reviewed and set to closed status on the GDMS within 28 days of the
flood's occurrence as detailed in the ADMM [Ref 1.N].

The location of all spills shall be recorded to OSGB36 datum, using the OSTN15 transformation model.
NOTE
Where the location of the spillage is recorded as a relative location, such as a marker post chainage,
this is in addition to the location as OS coordinates.
E/3.19
The severity of spills shall be quantified in accordance with the spill severity index definition, which can
be downloaded from the GDMS.
NOTE
The GDMS automatically calculates the spill severity Index from the information entered for each spill.
E/3.20
The nature of any impacts of a spills on the environment, third parties or other assets shall be assessed

Figure E/3.25 shall be uploaded to the GDMS.
E/3.27
Evidence and supporting documents shall contain information that enables the conclusions of the risk
assessment to be replicated independently.
E/3.27.1
Evidence and supporting documents may include:
1)
the culvert assessment worksheet;
2)
a desk study report;
3)
hydraulic model files;
4)
a field study report; and,
5)
a summary of the risk assessment results.
E/3.27.2
Where the culvert risk status is C or D the culvert is not a priority for mitigation works, however,
opportunities for mitigation should be taken in association with other works being carried out in the
vicinity.
NOTE 1
A culvert can fall into one of two scenarios:
1)
a current flood risk, with associated recorded floods on the GDMS; or,
2)
a future flood risk, with no associated recorded floods, however unrecorded floods could have
occurred, or hydraulic modelling could suggest the culvert is likely to flood due to inadequate
capacity.
NOTE 2
Further detailed guidance on the culverts assessment process can be accessed through the GDMS.
E/3.28
Culverts shall have their flooding risk assessed against the criteria in Figure E/3.28, being the worst of
either the carriageway or third party flooding impacts.

Where a lower risk priority asset or sub-catchment could be mitigated sooner than higher risk assets or
sub-catchments (without delaying mitigation of the higher risk locations), the lower risk asset or
sub-catchment may be mitigated earlier.
E/3.47
Mitigations of priority assets and sub-catchments shall be designed and implemented such that the risk
status is reduced as follows, when reassessed against the applicable risk level criteria given in this
section:
1)
sub-catchments and culverts reduced to a risk status of C or D (based on expected reduction in
future flooding); and,
2)
soakaways and outfalls reduced to a risk status of D.
E/3.48
Where assessment and prioritisation of risk indicates that a priority asset or sub-catchment requires
mitigation, the mitigation shall be designed and approved in accordance with the process in Figure

NOTE 2
Active management is less applicable to outfalls and soakaways than to flooding related mitigations.
E/3.49
Mitigations shall be designed in accordance with the requirements and guidance contained in the
related documents referenced in CG 501 [Ref 2.N] and that stated in LA 113 [Ref 9.N] and CD 529 [Ref
3.N].
E/3.50
Details of the mitigation shall be recorded on the GDMS, by updating the asset inventory data and
relevant priority asset or sub-catchment workflow.
E/3.51
Where the mitigation is implemented by active management, the following shall be recorded on the
GDMS, in the relevant workflow:
1)
details of the risk management processes to be implemented, including their frequency; and,
2)
ongoing records to demonstrate that the processes are being carried out.
NOTE
Active management measures can include, but are not limited to, processes such as automated or
manual monitoring, or a more regular, pro-active maintenance regime, to prevent future flooding or
pollution at the location.
E/3.52
Where active management processes have been implemented, these shall remain in place unless a
further assessment demonstrates that the risk level has been reduced to a sufficient level where
mitigations are not otherwise required, and remains at that level without those processes.
