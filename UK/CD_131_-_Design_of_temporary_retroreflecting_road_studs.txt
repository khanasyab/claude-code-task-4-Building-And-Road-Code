Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document specifies the product requirements and laboratory test methods for temporary
retroreflecting road studs which are to be used as part of temporary traffic management (TTM) on

This document covers temporary retroreflecting road studs with white, yellow, amber, red and green
reflectors.
The product requirements for temporary retroreflecting road studs were within the scope of the 2009
version of BS EN 1463-1 [Ref 4.N] although this version of the aforementioned standard has now been
withdrawn.
This document does not cover temporary non-retroreflecting road studs, active road studs or
permanent road studs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
