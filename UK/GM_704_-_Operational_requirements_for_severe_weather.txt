GM 704 Revision 0
Introduction
Introduction
Background
This is a new document to cover the requirements for the management of severe weather impacting on
the Overseeing Organisation's motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
Severe weather includes snow, ice, frost, freezing rain, hail, strong winds, heavy rain, fog and high
temperatures.
England and Wales have a a duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that safe passage along
a highway is not endangered by snow or ice, detailed in the Highways Act 1980 Section 41(1A)
(England and Wales) Highways Act 1980 [Ref 2.N].
Scotland has a legal responsibility to keep their roads free from snow and ice, detailed in Roads
(Scotland) Act 1984 Section 34 Roads(S) 1984 [Ref 4.N].
Northern Ireland has the discretionary power to prevent snow and ice interfering with safe passage as
detailed in The Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 Section 9 R(NI)O 1993 [Ref 5.N].
Severe weather service is planned in advance to allow a structured, disciplined, coordinated and
controlled approach to safely manage and mitigate the impact of forecast and changing severe weather
conditions. It is a systematic and coordinated use of human, institutional, mechanical and technical
resources to provide an effective and efficient service to meet the legal obligation.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
