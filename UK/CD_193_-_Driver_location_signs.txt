Introduction
Introduction
Background
Driver location signs (DLS) were developed to enable drivers to identify their location and have proved
successful in enabling the emergency services and vehicle recovery operators to rapidly locate the
scene of an incident. They use the same referencing system as the distance marker posts and help to
reduce the time needed to deal with the incident which reduces the risk of a secondary incident
occurring and therefore contribute to the improvement in road safety and reduced delays to road users.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

E/1. Technical requirements
E/1.
Technical requirements
E/1.1
DLS shall be provided on the nearside verge of motorways, including connector roads.
E/1.2
DLS provided on all-purpose trunk roads shall be subject to an assessment of the operational needs of
that route.
Format of sign faces
E/1.3
The design, colour and size of DLS must comply with TSRGD 2016 2016 [Ref 6.N] diagram 2718
(Schedule 11 Part 2 Item 61).
E/1.4
The design of DLS shall be the same for motorways and all-purpose trunk roads to aid driver
understanding of the signs.
E/1.5
In accordance with the TSRGD 2016 2016 [Ref 6.N], the sign face of DLS must consist of three lines of
legend as follows:
1) line 1 is the motorway or all-purpose trunk road route number, including any permitted suffix;
2) line 2 is the carriageway identifier;
3) line 3 is the unique locational reference.
NOTE 1
Permitted suffices are T for Toll (e.g. M6T) and (M) for motorway (e.g. A1(M)).
NOTE 2
The carriageway identifier indicates the direction the road user is travelling, with the main carriageway
identified as "A" in one direction (e.g. clockwise, or the direction heading away from London) and "B" in
the opposite direction (e.g. anti-clockwise, or the direction heading towards London).
NOTE 3
To ensure consistency, the A and B carriageways need to be consistent with other referencing systems,
especially across area or regional boundaries where coordination can be required between adjoining
Overseeing Organisations.
NOTE 4
The unique locational reference defines the precise location on the route, corresponding to the
associated distance marker post.
E/1.6
On a secondary carriageway, where there is a physical separation from the main carriageway, the
carriageway identifier shall be identified as "C" (adjacent to the A carriageway) and "D" (adjacent to the
B carriageway) as shown in Figure E/1.6
Figure E/1.6 Carriageway identifiers on secondary carriageways
E/1.7
On connector roads to a nearby route, the carriageway identifiers shall be "J", "K" "L" and "M" as shown
in Figure E/1.7.

E/1. Technical requirements
Figure E/1.7 Carriageway identifiers on connector roads
NOTE
The lettering as shown in Figure E/1.7 is specific to the main carriageway identifiers, i.e. an exit slip
from the "A" carriageway is always designated as "J".
E/1.8
Carriageway identifiers "J", "K" "L" and "M" shall not be used on the main carriageway or on parallel
adjacent carriageways as shown in Figure E/1.6.
E/1.8.1
Sign faces should be designed in accordance with the requirements of Table E/1.8.1.

140
NOTE
DLS are intended to be read by drivers:
1) travelling at reduced speed;
2) when the driver is either stopped on the hard shoulder; or
3) in slow moving traffic.
Siting of driver location signs
E/1.9
DLS shall not be positioned on the central reserve of dual carriageway roads, or on the off-side verge of
slip roads, link roads or other uni-directional roads.
E/1.10
DLS shall be additional to distance marker posts, including any marker post that would be coincident
with the DLS.
E/1.10.1
The longitudinal spacing of DLS should be 500m.
E/1.10.2
The location tolerance for a DLS should be within 20m of the associated distance marker post
containing the same locational reference information.
NOTE
The location tolerance is provided to accommodate site specific issues which make it impracticable to
locate the DLS immediately adjacent to the associated distance marker post.
E/1.10.3
At locations where the longitudinal spacing for DLS of 500m cannot be achieved due to site constraints,
the spacing may be reduced in increments of 100m, to 400m or to a minimum of 300m.

E/1. Technical requirements
NOTE
For a sequence of DLS along a route, the longitudinal spacing can be a combination of the permitted
spacings, such as 500m, then 500m, then 300m, then 400m, then 500m.
E/1.10.4
The minimum clear visibility of DLS should be in accordance with Table E/1.10.4

shoulder
90
E/1.11
The minimum downstream installation distance of a DLS from a structure or other sign shall be greater
than the minimum clear visibility distance stated in Table E/1.10.4.
NOTE
A minimum downstream installation distance in accordance with E/1.11 from a structure or other sign
ensures visibility and legibility requirements for the DLS are achieved.
E/1.11.1
Where the length of a tunnel, bridge or viaduct is less than 400m, DLS should be positioned on the
nearside verge, at the start of the tunnel, bridge or viaduct and greater than the minimum clear visibility
distance stated in Table E/1.10.4 downstream of the end.
NOTE
Installing DLS on the nearside verge, at the start of the tunnel, bridge or viaduct and in accordance with
Table E/1.10.4 downstream of the end, avoids attaching DLS to the parapet or tunnel wall.
E/1.11.2
Where the length of a tunnel, bridge or viaduct is longer than 400m, at least one DLS should be located
within the length of the tunnel or parapet.
E/1.12
At a junction, the last DLS on the main carriageway before the exit shall be at least 100m upstream of
the exit datum point on the approach to the junction.
E/1.13
At a junction, the first DLS on the main carriageway after the exit shall be at least 100m downstream of
the exit datum point.
E/1.14
At a junction, the first DLS on the connector road shall be at least 100m downstream of the "back of
nose", such that a driver on the main carriageway, who stops on the hard shoulder just downstream of
the nose, cannot see a connector road DLS.
E/1.15
At a junction, the last DLS on the connector road before it joins the main carriageway shall be at least
100m upstream of the "back of the nose", such that a driver on the main carriageway, who stops on the
hard shoulder just upstream of the nose, cannot see a connector road DLS.

NOTE
The "back of nose" and "exit datum point" are as defined in CD 122 [Ref 1.N].
E/1.15.1
A DLS should be sited downstream of the midpoint of emergency areas (EAs) on motorways, and in
lay-bys on all-purpose trunk roads where it has been determined that DLS are to be provided and an
emergency roadside telephone is installed within the lay-by.
E/1.15.2
The DLS should be located between a point 20m downstream of the EA or lay-by midpoint and the
maximum legibility distance given in Table E/1.15.2 from the downstream end of the EA or lay-by.

Where the distance from the mid-point of the EA or lay-by and the next downstream distance marker
post exceeds the maximum legibility distance, the DLS may be located up to 20m upstream of the
associated distance marker post to achieve the legibility distance.
NOTE
The "maximum legibility distance" is the maximum distance at which a sign is deemed to be legible to
an observer satisfying the minimum eyesight requirements specified in Section 96 of the Road Traffic
Act Road Traffic Act 1988 [Ref 3.N], and Regulation 40 and Schedule 8 of The Motor Vehicles (Driving
Licences) Regulations 1999 [Ref 4.N].

E/1.16
Approval of locations and fixing details of the DLS to parapets, tunnel walls or other structures shall be
obtained from Highways England before installation works commence.
E/1.16.1
DLS should be located in accordance with the lateral placement and orientation guidance given in the
TSM Chapter 1 2018 [Ref 7.N].
E/1.16.2
The mounting height of DLS should be in accordance with the guidance given in TSM Chapter 1 2018
[Ref 7.N] and be a minimum of 1300mm.
E/1.16.3
Where site constraints prevent a DLS from being oriented with its face perpendicular to the alignment
of the adjacent running lane and located within 500m of adjacent DLS, the sign should be positioned
adjacent to the distance marker post with the sign face parallel to the adjacent running lane.
