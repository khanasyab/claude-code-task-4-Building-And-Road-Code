Advance direction sign
sign giving route information in respect of a junction ahead
Confirmatory direction sign
a sign placed over the diverge (gantry mounted) or on the nosing
(verge mounted) which confirms the destinations and/or routes
reached from the junction
Datum points
defined points at merges and diverges used for the purposes of
locating features such as signs and signals and measuring
weaving lengths.
Downstream
a position trailing a reference point, measured in the direction of
travel.
Ghost island
an area of the carriageway marked to separate lanes of traffic
travelling in the same direction on merge and diverge layouts.
NOTE 1: The purpose of the ghost island at a merge is to separate
the points of entry of two slip road traffic lanes.
NOTE 2: At a diverge it is to separate the points of exit to a slip
road.
Inter-junction
This is the region between junctions on the mainline carriageway
between the merge tip of the nose of one junction and the diverge
tip of the nose of the next junction.
NOTE: Definition from TD 131 [Ref 2.I].
Intra-junction
This is the region within a junction on the mainline carriageway
between the diverge tip of the nose and the entry tip of the nose.
NOTE 1: Intra-junction also includes the entry slip road.
Upstream
a position in advance of a reference point, measured in the
direction of travel.
Variable message signs (VMS)
VMS are technology devices, within the definition of Schedule 16 of
the UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 3.N], capable of displaying, at
different times, two or more defined legends or messages.
NOTE: VMS can be in the form of light emitting or non-light
emitting, electrical or electromechanical devices.

General
2.1
Where an existing portal gantry is present and it has residual design life, the feasibility of reusing this
existing infrastructure shall be assessed while complying with the functional, spacing and visibility
requirements specified in this document.
NOTE
An assessment for the feasibility of reusing the existing equipment is to be undertaken as part of the
feasibility, option selection or design phase of a scheme.
2.1.1
Variable message signs (VMS) and direction signs associated with a junction should be cantilever- and
post-mounted respectively.
NOTE
It is not necessary to provide VMS in the central reserve.
2.2
Where cantilever-mounted signals/signs are to be installed and the lighting is in the verge,
signals/signs shall be positioned at least one column length away from the nearest lighting column.
NOTE
Cantilever-mounted signals/signs are positioned at least one column length away from the nearest
lighting column to prevent damage being sustained by the signal in the event of the lighting column
being knocked down by a vehicle. The lantern height is usually 10 m or greater and therefore does not
interfere with signal visibility.
2.3
The Traffic Signs Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997 ( NISR 1997/386 (TSRNI) [Ref 5.N]) must be
applied in Northern Ireland.
NOTE
In Northern Ireland, where a clause in CD 146 refers to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General
Directions ( UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 3.N]), the reference is replaced by the NISR 1997/386
(TSRNI) [Ref 5.N].

NOTE 1
Beyond 115 metres upstream of the 1 1/4 mile primary ADS, a 1 1/3 mile ADS is more accurate than a
1 1/4 mile primary ADS.
NOTE 2
Illustrative diverge and merge layouts for ADS are provided in Figures A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A.
3.3
The hierarchy of primary and secondary ADS positioning shall be applied in sequence starting at
'priority 1' as shown in Table 3.2.
3.3.1
Only when it is not practicable to provide a combination of signs within the tolerances given in Table
3.2, a lower priority combination may be used.
3.3.2
ADS should be positioned as close as practicable to the distances they sign.
3.4
A final direction sign shall be positioned at the exit datum or up to 50 metres upstream of it.
3.5
A confirmatory direction sign shall be provided.
3.6
Where there is a confirmatory above-lane signal gantry, the confirmatory direction sign shall be
co-located on the confirmatory above lane signal gantry.
3.7
Where there is no confirmatory above-lane signal gantry, the confirmatory direction sign shall be
positioned either:
1)
on the verge of the 'diverge' island, not more than 30 metres beyond the physical nose;
2)
on a gantry between 30 and 50 metres downstream of the diverge nose tip.
3.8
For ghost island diverges, verge mounted signs in accordance with Diagram 2904.2 of UKSI 2016/362
(TSRGD) [Ref 3.N] shall be provided between the primary and secondary ADS and between the
secondary ADS and the final direction sign.
3.8.1
For ghost island diverges, verge mounted signs should be positioned as close as practicable to the
midpoint between the relevant ADSs.

3. Motorway advance direction signs
NOTE
For ghost island diverges, verge mounted signs which include a distance of less than 1/3 mile are
non-prescribed signs and require authorisation in accordance with UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 3.N].
Criteria to be met before using gantries for direction signs
3.9
Gantries shall only be used for mounting direction signs where one or more of the following criteria are
met:
1)
the carriageway has or is due to have 4 or more running lanes;
2)
the carriageway has 3 running lanes and carries (or is due to carry within 15 years of opening)
33,000 vehicles per day (1-way) (high growth estimate) and the proportion of HGVs is greater
than 20%;
3)
the number of lanes available to a driver going ahead reduces after the junction;
4)
a series of junctions are (an average of) less than 3 km apart measured between centres of
junctions;
5)
the road is on a structure but does not have a hard shoulder;
6)
the road is on a steep embankment or in a deep cutting;
7)
an assessment of the cost has confirmed that it is cheaper to provide gantry mounted signs
rather than mounting direction signs on the left-hand side of the road.
NOTE 1
Side-mounted signs can be obscured for a significant proportion of a driver's 'reading time' when the
traffic volume is high and when the proportion of HGVs is high. It is also a function of the width of the
road where the driver in the extreme right-hand lane has the highest probability of poor visibility due to
the traffic in the other lanes.
NOTE 2
The demands on drivers are greater when approaching complex layouts which can draw their attention
away from the road, including where the number of lanes reduces after a junction, where junctions
follow in quick succession or on elevated roads.
Carriageways with 5 or more lanes
3.10
Where ADS signs are to be provided on sections of 5 or more lanes, they shall be mounted on gantries.

Motorway signalling and variable message signs
General
4.1
Where the operational need for above-lane signals has been established, above-lane signals shall be
positioned in accordance with the requirements within the 'Motorway above-lane signals' sub-section.
4.1.1
Where the provision of above-lane signalling is not justified, verge mounted VMS should be provided if:
1)
the existing signalling infrastructure is near the end of its design life or where an opportunity for
replacement is provided by highway improvement or maintenance works; or,
2)
the VMS are being used in a sequence forming part of a signalling scheme and not on an
individual basis.
4.1.2
Where the operational need for a system of signalling has been identified, gantries for motorway
signalling should be positioned in a sequence and not on an individual basis.
4.1.3
Above-lane signals or variable message signs (VMS) should not be positioned within 300 m
downstream of a change in the number of carriageway lanes between junctions.
4.1.4
The Overseeing Organisation should be advised at an early stage of any signals outside the scheme
boundaries that may be impacted by the proposed works.
NOTE
The boundaries between carriageway and lane signalling cannot always coincide with the limits of the
scheme if safe signal sequencing is to be achieved. Therefore, it is important to check the effect of the
scheme design on existing signals in adjacent sections of motorway.
4.2
The spacing between any ADS(s) and/or signal(s) shall be no less than 180 m.
4.2.1
The spacing between a VMS and a route confirmatory sign, or a sign indicating the distance to the next
motorway service area should be at least 200 m.
Motorway variable message signs
4.3
Where a new system of variable message signs (VMS) is to be provided and above-lane signals are
not, or not planned, to be present, VMS shall be located in accordance with the requirements in the
'Motorway variable message signs' sub-section of this document.
NOTE
Illustrative diverge and merge layouts for VMS are provided in Figures A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A.
4.4
Where above-lane signals are, or planned to be, present, VMS shall be located in accordance with
requirements in the 'Motorway above lane signals' section of this document.
4.5
The first VMS shall be provided between 200 and 400 metres downstream of the entry datum point.
4.5.1
The first VMS downstream of the entry datum point should be provided as close to the 300 metres point
as practicable.
NOTE
The function of a first or primary VMS can be fulfilled by a single VMS.
4.6
A primary VMS shall be provided between 200 and 400 metres upstream of the primary ADS.
4.6.1
The primary VMS upstream of the primary ADS should be provided as close to the 300 metres point as
practicable.
NOTE
The function of a first or primary VMS can be fulfilled by a single VMS.
4.6.2
Where it is not practicable to locate the primary VMS between 200 and 400 metres upstream of the
primary ADS, the VMS may be co-located with the relevant gantry mounted ADS.
4.7
A secondary VMS shall be provided between 200 and 400 metres upstream of the secondary ADS, and
a minimum of 180 metres downstream of the primary ADS.
4.7.1
The secondary VMS upstream of the secondary ADS should be provided as close to the 300 metres
point as practicable.

NOTE
The function of a first or secondary VMS can be fulfilled by a single VMS.
4.7.2
Where it is not practicable to locate a secondary VMS between 200 and 400 metres upstream of the
secondary ADS, the VMS may be co-located with the relevant gantry mounted ADS.
4.8
A final VMS shall be provided at the back of the diverge nose.
4.8.1
The final VMS should be provided as close as practicable to the back of the diverge nose.
4.9
VMS shall be spaced between 600 and 1,500 metres apart between the first VMS and the primary VMS.
4.10
An intra-junction VMS shall be provided if the distance between the first VMS and the upstream VMS is
greater than 1,500 metres.
4.10.1
The intra-junction VMS should be located as near to the midpoint of the upstream VMS and first VMS
as practicable.
4.11
There shall be unobstructed forward visibility to each VMS for at least two thirds of the distance
between the VMS in question and the upstream VMS.
4.12
Visibility shall be measured to the centre of the VMS:
1)
from the centre of the left-hand lane on left-hand curves with radii up to 2,880 m;
2)
from the centre of the right-hand lane on right-hand curves with radii up to 2,880 m; and
3)
from the centre of the lane closest to the signal elsewhere.
Motorway strategic variable message signs

E/1.8.1
Above-lane signals and VMS downstream of the entry datum point should be provided as close to the
300 metres point as practicable.
E/1.8.2
Where there are two successive merges, and the distance between the end of the first merge and the
nose of the second merge does not allow room to locate a gateway gantry between 200 and 400
metres, then the gateway gantry at the first merge may be omitted.
E/1.9
A minimum of two signal sites per link (between the entry and exit datum points) shall be provided.
E/1.9.1
The second set of signals, on a link with only two signal sites, may either be above-lane or carriageway
signals.
NOTE 1
Signal spacing at less than 600 m is acceptable to meet the requirement to provide a minimum of two
signal sites per link (between the entry and exit datum points).
NOTE 2
The selection of signal type for the second site needs to be endorsed by the SCRG (Safety Control
Review Group).
E/1.9.2
The spacing between the two signal sites per link should be equal.
E/1.10
For distances between 5 km and 6 km measured from the gateway signal to the downstream
continuation/termination VMS at the back of the diverge nose, an assessment shall be undertaken to
determine whether additional "above lane signals and VMS" sites are to be provided, as shown in
Figures E/A.1 and E/A.2 at the "intermediate signals and VMS" location.
NOTE
The decision whether additional "above-lane signals and VMS" sites are provided for link lengths
between 5 km and 6 km measured from the gateway signal to the downstream continuation/termination
VMS at the back of the diverge nose needs to be endorsed by the SCRG.
E/1.11
Where the link exceeds 6 km then a minimum of one "intermediate signal and VMS" site shall be
provided.
NOTE
The decision to provide one or more "intermediate signal and VMS" sites if the link exceeds 6 km needs
to be endorsed by the SCRG.

functional, spacing and visibility requirements, thereby co-locating the control signalling with the
primary, secondary and final direction signs.
E/1.15
Mandatory control signals shall be spaced between a minimum of 600 m and up to a maximum of 1500
m apart.
NOTE 1
The actual mandatory control signal spacing is determined by the requirements in the 'visibility
requirements for control signalling/VMS' sub-section.
NOTE 2
The spacing requirements for mandatory control signals is also applicable at MSAs.
NOTE 3
Any situation where mandatory control signal spacing is less than 600 m is to be endorsed by the
SCRG.

At intra-junction, mandatory control signals spaced less than 600 m or more than 1500 m is to be
endorsed by the SCRG.
E/1.16
Signal gantries shall not be positioned such that they span a ghost island.
NOTE
Signal gantries positioned such that they span a ghost island can cause inappropriate signals to be
displayed to road users.
E/1.17
An intra-junction VMS with combined signal shall be provided if the distance between the continuation
VMS/conditioning VMS and the gateway signal/VMS following the junction merge, is greater than 1500
m.

to each signal for at least half of the distance between the signal in question and the signal upstream.
E/1.20
The maximum distance between the upstream signal and the start of visibility of the downstream signal
shall not exceed 600 m.
NOTE
Where a scheme design proposes non-visibility distances greater than 500 m, this is to be endorsed by
the SCRG and the Operations technical leadership group.
E/1.21
Where the downstream signal is provided by a verge mounted VMS, the unobstructed forward visibility
shall be provided for a minimum of 50% of the VMS sign face (right hand side).

The unobstructed forward visibility shall be determined:
1)
from the centre line of the right-hand traffic lane on right-hand bends;
2)
from the centre line of the left-hand traffic lane on left-hand bends;
3)
from the centre point of any lane on straights or near straights.

E/1.24
The need for fixed taper points (FTPs) shall be established.
E/1.24.1
The final signal/VMS should be positioned between 300 m and 450 m upstream of the FTP.
E/1.24.2
The secondary signal/VMS should be positioned between 500 m and 1500 m from the final signal/VMS.
E/1.24.3
The primary signal/VMS should be positioned between 500 m and 1500 m from the secondary
signal/VMS.
E/1.25
For every emergency area (EA) situated on the mainline or on a motorway-to-motorway interchange
link, a VMS shall be located upstream of the EA such that the EA end of exit taper is visible from all
lanes at a point adjacent to this VMS.
NOTE 1
VMS located upstream of the EA is referred to as the EA VMS.
NOTE 2
VMS located upstream of the EA such that a vehicle exiting the EA is visible from all lanes at a point
adjacent to this VMS, enables a message advising road users that a vehicle could be leaving the EA to
be set.
E/1.26
The visibility requirements in this Section shall be met for signal sites that are designated as 'live' and
'non-live' enforcement sites.
Strategic variable message signing
E/1.27
In addition to the requirements of CD 146, where it is not possible to relocate strategic VMS according
to the requirements, alternative positions shall be agreed with regional control centres (RCC), national
traffic information service (NTIS) and the senior user and endorsed by the SCRG.
Entry slip signals (ESS)
E/1.28
ESS shall be provided at all junctions.
E/1.29
ESS shall be located at the last decision point before accessing the motorway.
NOTE 1
The last decision point can be the start of the slip road, such that customers still have the option not to
join the motorway (during a motorway closure) when viewing the signal(s).
NOTE 2
Multiple directions of entry to a slip road can require additional signals to provide visibility from all
approach angles.
E/1.30
Where the first signal downstream of the merge is not visible from the entry datum point, existing ESS
shall be upgraded to be capable of displaying all of the following:
1)
advisory speed limits;
2)
mandatory speed limits;
3)
lane control aspects.
E/1.30.1
Where existing ESS are being upgraded the existing infrastructure should be reused where it has been
determined that it has residual design life.
E/1.30.2
Existing ESS capable of displaying advisory aspects may be retained if they are located to provide
visibility from all approach angles, and the first signal downstream of the merge is visible from the entry
datum point.
E/1.31
Where existing ESS are not located at the start of the slip to meet the visibility requirements, or there
are no existing ESS, then a single mandatory ESS shall be installed at the start of the slip road, located
to provide visibility from all approach angles.
E/1.32
Where visibility from all approach angles is not achieved with one signal, additional signals shall be
provided to achieve visibility from all approach angles.

(during a motorway closure) when viewing the signal.
E/1.33.1
Where the first signal downstream of the merge is visible from the entry datum point, existing ESS at
MSAs may be retained.
E/1.33.2
Where the first signal downstream of the merge is not visible from the entry datum point, existing ESS
at MSAs should be replaced with a single ESS capable of displaying:
1)
advisory speed limits;
2)
mandatory speed limits; and
3)
lane control aspects.
E/1.34
ESS shall be positioned downstream of the motorway regulatory sign to Diagram 2901 of UKSI
