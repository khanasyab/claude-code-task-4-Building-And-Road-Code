Introduction
Introduction
Background
Road pavements do not last indefinitely. At some stage in their lives signs of wear such as polishing,
rutting, fretting and cracking may show on the surface. Maintenance is required when these signs of
wear are judged to affect the standards of service provided to the road user and the integrity of the
pavement structure.
The Overseeing Organisations use a hierarchical approach to assess the needs of the carriageways on
motorways and all-purpose trunk roads:
1) Network-level surveys, undertaken on a routine basis, are used to identify lengths of pavement that
potentially require maintenance. Wherever possible these surveys are undertaken at traffic speed. The
requirements for this process are set out in this document. Requirements to be used to determine and
assess skidding resistance on the network are set out in CS 228 [Ref 2.I].
2) Once a length has been identified as requiring maintenance then a detailed investigation is required
to determine the maintenance need and to provide the information required to design the appropriate
maintenance treatments. The requirements for this process are set out in CD 227 [Ref 1.N].
3) The technical requirements and associated advice for collecting the scheme-level data required to
support this process are set out in CS 229 [Ref 1.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 2.N]Introduction to the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (as the standard
text in MDD v6 cl 4.39).

Network level surveys
2.1
This section sets out details of the network level pavement condition surveys that shall be undertaken
and used to identify lengths of pavement that require maintenance.
NOTE 1
Network level surveys are carried out on a routine basis on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads. Wherever possible these surveys are undertaken at traffic speed.
NOTE 2
Network level surveys can be categorised as surface condition or structural condition.
Surface condition surveys
2.2
Surface condition surveys shall be undertaken on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads in accordance with the National Application Annex (NAA).
NOTE 1
Surface condition surveys are undertaken at traffic speed using survey vehicles equipped with
sophisticated measurement apparatus.
NOTE 2
Typically surface condition surveys provide data on rutting (transverse profile), ride quality (longitudinal
profile), texture depth and road geometry (gradient, crossfall and curvature). They can include
collection of forward and downward facing images.
NOTE 3
Some of the data collected by surface condition surveys can be used to provide information on the
structural condition of the pavement.
NOTE 4
Skidding resistance is a property of surface condition. This document does not cover skidding
resistance. Requirements for determining and assessing skidding resistance on the network are set out
in CS 228 [Ref 2.I].
Structural condition surveys
2.3
Structural condition surveys shall be undertaken on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads in accordance with the NAA.
NOTE
Typically structural condition surveys provide data on the deflection response of the pavement. This
data is used to assess the structural strength of the pavement.

3. Other sources of relevant data
3.
Other sources of relevant data
3.1
To supplement the data collected from network-level condition surveys, data from other sources shall
be used to assist with the identification of lengths of pavement that potentially require maintenance.
3.1.1
Data from the following sources should be used:
1) safety inspections;
2) other routine inspections that are regularly undertaken to identify the presence of pavement defects;
3) records of unplanned and/or reactive maintenance.
NOTE
Data from the previous three years are typically used to identify lengths of road that are regularly and/or
repeatedly requiring maintenance.
3.1.2
Information from other records and sources of data may be used to assist with the identification of
lengths of pavement that require maintenance.

4. Review of data
4.
Review of data
4.1
The network level survey data (described in Section 2) and the additional data (described in Section 3)
shall be collated and reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the NAA in order to identify
lengths of pavement for potential maintenance treatment.
NOTE 1
The review involves comparing the outputs from the network level data against threshold levels of
condition for different parameters. Lengths where one or more of the parameters exceed the threshold
values can indicate the need for further investigation.
NOTE 2
Records of inspections, unplanned maintenance and reactive maintenance from the past three years
are typically used to identify additional lengths. These records can also provide supplementary
evidence for lengths already identified by the network level surveys.
4.2
Lengths of pavement identified for potential maintenance treatment shall be subject to a visual
assessment, either a drive-over or a review of video images, before finalising the list of lengths to be
investigated.
NOTE
The visual assessment information can provide supporting evidence of the current condition.
4.3
Lengths of pavement identified for potential maintenance treatment shall be selected for further
investigation.
4.4
The reasons why lengths have been selected for further investigation shall be documented and
retained.
NOTE
The list of lengths can be reviewed by the Overseeing Organisation.
4.5
Where further investigations are proposed, these shall be undertaken in accordance with CD 227 [Ref
1.N].

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the National Highways-specific requirements for routine,
network-level surveys of pavement surface condition and structural condition. It sets out the
requirements for reviewing the outputs from these surveys in order to identify lengths of carriageway
that are potentially in need of maintenance and that require a detailed assessment. It does not cover
the routine measurement of skidding resistance which is dealt with in CS 228 [Ref 2.I].
This document also sets out the requirements for identifying technically simple pavement schemes
(TSS) and lengths that may be suitable for a preventative maintenance treatment using an asphalt
preservation system. Technically simple pavement schemes are lengths of carriageway where there
are no structural problems i.e. where deterioration is confined to the surface course. These schemes
can require renewal of only the surface course and are subject to a simplified development and
assessment process. Lengths identified as being suitable for a preventative maintenance treatment
using network data are subject to further laboratory investigation as set out in CD 227 [Ref 3.N].
This revision includes additional requirements covering the network level assessment of legacy
concrete pavements.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the mutual recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 4.N].

E/1.
Network level surveys
Surface condition surveys (CS 230, 2.2)
TRACS contract and parameters
E/1.1
Network level surface condition surveys on the National Highways motorway and all-purpose trunk road
network shall be undertaken as part of the TRACS4 contract, centrally managed by National Highways.
NOTE 1
TRACS stands for TRAffic-speed condition survey.
NOTE 2
The coverage and frequency of surveys are set out in the TRACS4 contract. TRACS surveys cover all
mainline running lanes and lane 1 of slip roads. Roundabouts are not included.
E/1.2
The TRACS vehicles shall be accredited by National Highways for use on their network.
E/1.3
TRACS surveys shall be controlled by a detailed quality audit procedure for the surveys, which includes
regular independent checks to maintain quality assurance.
E/1.4
TRACS surveys shall provide the following information about the pavement:
1) geometry (gradient, crossfall, radius);
2) rutting;
3) 3-m, 10-m and 30-m enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV);
4) bump measure;
5) sensor measured texture depth (SMTD);
6) lane fretting intensity (reported on asphalt surfaces only);
7) noise;
8) surface type; and,
9) cracking (reported on asphalt surfaces only).
NOTE 1
TRACS data is available in HAPMS and is referenced to the HAPMS network.
NOTE 2
The road geometry measures are used in the classification of site categories for assigning investigatory
levels of skidding resistance. See CS 228 [Ref 2.I]
NOTE 3
The TRACS cracking measure was introduced in 2018 and there are currently no guidance levels for
interpretation of this parameter.
NOTE 4
TRACS also measures retroreflectivity of road markings. Inspection and maintenance of road markings
is covered in CS 126 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 5
TRACS also collects high quality downward and forward facing images. These images provide
information that can be used for detailed visual condition surveys of the carriageway as described in CS
229 [Ref 1.N] and for the network visual assessment of rigid pavements, as described in this document.
NOTE 6
For legacy concrete pavements, condition is assessed centrally by National Highways using condition
data derived from a modified analysis of TRACS data.
NOTE 7
Detailed guidance on the TRACS parameters is provided in the TRACS guidance documents available
to National Highways staff and authorised service providers.
NOTE 8
Further information is available from the National Highways HAPMS support team (HAST).
TRACS texture depth, rut depth and eLPV
TRACS condition categories
E/1.5
TRACS texture depth, rut depth and enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) data shall be
assessed against the four condition categories defined in Table E/1.5.

HAPMS.
NOTE 2
Texture is reported on all surface types.
NOTE 3
Changes in texture depth can indicate a potential loss of skid resistance. Advice on the interpretation of
texture depth data in connection with skid resistance is given in CS 228 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 4
Lower texture depth values are applied to HFS due to the different way in which skid resistance is
provided by these materials.
NOTE 5
The texture depth of HFS can only be in condition category 1 or 2.
Enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV)
E/1.8
The TRACS eLPV levels that shall be used to define condition category are given in Tables E/1.8a to

NOTE 1
The categories apply to the 100-m TRACS length weighted (LW) average maximum eLPV values as
reported by HAPMS.
NOTE 2
The three eLPV measures reported in HAPMS indicate the level of profile unevenness within
wavelength ranges less than or equal to 3 m, 10 m and 30 m. These values are broadly correlated to
levels of ride comfort (ride quality).
NOTE 3
The eLPV values are set to reflect the standard of ride quality required on different types of road. For
example, motorways require a better standard of ride quality than urban single carriageways.
NOTE 4
The road classifications are based on the road classifications in HAPMS.
TRACS lane fretting intensity
E/1.9
TRACS lane fretting Intensity shall be assessed against the guidance values shown in Table E/1.9.

≥20
NOTE 1
The categories apply to the 100-m TRACS length weighted (LW) average lane fretting intensity values
as reported by HAPMS.
NOTE 2
TRACS lane fretting intensity applies to all asphalt surfaces.
NOTE 3
TRACS lane fretting intensity is reported within the range 0 to 625.
TRACS bump measure
E/1.10
The TRACS bump measure shall be used to identify lengths containing short defects ("bumps") that are
not effectively identified from eLPV.
NOTE 1
The parameter is reported from HAPMS as 100-m TRACS length weighted average bump measure.
NOTE 2
"Bumps" can cause jolt-like sensations within vehicles. Examples of "bumps" include sunken ironwork,
potholes and poor transverse joints.
NOTE 3
The bump measure is reported as either 0 or 1.1 indicates that the length contains one or more
"bumps".
TRACS surface type and noise
E/1.11
TRACS surface type and noise shall be used to provide additional information about lengths of
pavement that have been identified as potentially being in need of maintenance.
E/1.11.1
The TRACS surface type may be used to cross check the accuracy of the surface construction records
in HAPMS.
NOTE
The TRACS surface type provides a prediction of the surface type based on texture data and luminosity
of the surface.
E/1.11.2
The TRACS noise measure may be used to aid the investigation of noise levels.
NOTE
The TRACS noise measure provides a prediction of the noise levels generated by the surface/tyre
interaction based on texture and the TRACS surface type.
Assessment of legacy concrete pavements
E/1.12
The condition of legacy concrete pavements shall be assessed using condition data that is derived from
a modified analysis of TRACS data.
E/1.13
Legacy concrete pavements shall be assigned a state as defined in table E/1.13.

E/1.17
Network level structural condition surveys on the National Highways motorway and all-purpose trunk
road network shall be undertaken as part of the TRASS3 contract, centrally managed by National
Highways.
NOTE 1
TRASS stands for TRAffic-speed Structural condition Surveys (TRASS).
NOTE 2
TRASS survey data is only valid for flexible pavements i.e. flexible with an asphalt base and flexible
with an HBM base.
NOTE 3
The coverage and frequency of surveys are set out in the TRASS3 contract. TRASS surveys cover
lane 1 and lane 2 of mainline and lane 1 of slip roads. Roundabouts are not included.
E/1.18
National Highways' traffic speed deflectometer (TSD) shall be used to carry out the TRASS surveys.
E/1.19

TRASS data is available in HAPMS and is referenced to the HAPMS network.
E/1.22
The latest construction and traffic information shall be used when reviewing TRASS data for
assessment purposes.
NOTE
The robustness of the reported TRASS analysis results are critically dependent on the availability of
accurate construction and traffic data in HAPMS.
Condition categories
E/1.23
The results from TRASS shall be assessed against the four network structural condition (NSC)
categories defined in Table E/1.22.
Table E/1.23 TRASS network structural condition (NSC) categories
NSC category
Description
1
Flexible pavements without any need for structural maintenance
2
Flexible pavements unlikely to need structural maintenance
3
Flexible pavements likely to need structural maintenance
4
Flexible pavements very likely to need structural maintenance
Null
Unable to complete valid analysis of TRASS data
NOTE 1
The categories apply to the 100-m TRASS NSC as reported by HAPMS.
NOTE 2
NSC is reported as "null" when it is not possible to complete the analysis procedure satisfactorily; for
example where pavement quality concrete is present or where construction and/or traffic data are not
available.

E/2.
Review of data (CS 230, 4.1)
Legacy concrete pavements
E/2.1
For legacy concrete pavements, condition data shall be reviewed in order to select lengths of the
network that are candidates for lifecycle extension works (LEW) ahead of reconstruction.
All other pavements
E/2.2
TRACS and TRASS condition data, obtained from HAPMS, and the additional data described in CS
230 [Ref 5.N] Section 3 shall be collated and reviewed on an annual basis in order to identify lengths of
pavement that are showing signs of deterioration.
E/2.3
The review of this data shall be used to select lengths of the network that warrant detailed investigation
in order to determine the causes and extent of the deterioration.
NOTE 1
Isolated short (100 m) lengths which are exhibiting slight levels of deterioration are unlikely to require
further investigation.
NOTE 2
Lengths that are exhibiting significant levels of deterioration, or adjacent lengths that are exhibiting
moderate levels of deterioration, are likely to require further investigation.
TRACS data
E/2.4
For the network review, TRACS condition data (100-m reporting length) shall be obtained from HAPMS
using the most recent TRACS length weighted average (LWAVG) data source.
NOTE
The HAPMS database contains current and historical TRACS data.
E/2.4.1
TRACS data from earlier surveys may also be used to provide additional information on the rate of
change of condition.
NOTE 1
Time series analysis can be useful in determining how quickly pavements are deteriorating.
NOTE 2
Some of the parameters have changed how they are reported over time and it is not appropriate to
directly compare values for these parameters.
NOTE 3
Further information on the evolution of the TRACS condition parameters is available to National
Highways staff and authorised service providers.
Texture, rutting and eLPV
E/2.5
TRACS data for texture depth, rutting and eLPV shall be assessed against the four condition categories
defined in Table E/1.5.
E/2.6
Any 100-m length in condition category 4 shall be assessed as showing signs of deterioration.
E/2.7
Any two 100-m lengths in condition category 3 within 1 km of one another shall be assessed as
showing signs of deterioration.
Lane fretting intensity and bump measure
E/2.8
Lane fretting intensity and bump measure shall be reviewed against the corresponding guide values
given in Section E/1.
Network visual assessment of CRCPs
E/2.9
The results of the network visual assessment for CRCPs, designed in accordance with CD 226 [Ref
2.N], shall be assessed against the four condition categories defined in Table E/1.16.
E/2.10
Any 100-m length in condition category 2 or higher shall be assessed as showing signs of deterioration.
E/2.10.1
Any 100-m length in condition category 4 should be selected for a renewal pavement investigation in
accordance with CD 227 [Ref 3.N].

E/2. Review of data (CS 230, 4.1)
TRASS data
E/2.11
For the network review, TRASS condition data (100-m reporting length) shall be obtained from HAPMS
using the most recent TRASS data source.
NOTE
The HAPMS database contains current and historical TRASS data.
E/2.12
The structural condition of each 100-m reporting length shall be assigned one of four levels of network
structural condition (NSC) category, as defined in Table E/1.22.
NOTE
The NSC categories are used:
1) in the identification of technically simple pavement schemes;
2) in the identification of lengths suitable for preventative maintenance;
3) to potentially reduce the need for deflectograph surveys ( CD 227 [Ref 3.N]).
Identifying lengths suitable for preventative maintenance
E/2.13
A review of the network level condition data described in this document and the characteristic skid
coefficient data described in CS 228 [Ref 2.I] shall be used to select lengths of the network that warrant
further investigation in order to confirm their suitability for receiving a preventative maintenance
treatment.
NOTE
Preventative maintenance can extend the service life of an existing thin surface course system.
E/2.14
Lengths suitable for investigation for receiving a preventative maintenance treatment shall meet all of
the following criteria:
1) be surfaced throughout with a thin surface course system (TSCS) greater than five years old;
2) be free of all signs of visual defects;
3) TRACS texture depth, rut depth and eLPV all in condition category 1;
4) TRACS lane fretting intensities all <2;
5) TRASS NSCs all in category 1 or 2; and,
6) characteristic skid coefficient (CSC) above investigatory level (IL).
NOTE 1
The initial identification of sites is based on network level data.
NOTE 2
A visual assessment, either a drive-over or a review of video images, can be used to confirm that the
length is free of visual defects.
NOTE 3
Assessment of characteristic skid coefficients and investigatory levels is set out in CS 228 [Ref 2.I].
E/2.15
Lengths that are selected from the review shall be subject to laboratory testing to confirm that the TSCS
material is suitable to receive a preventative treatment as set out in Section 4 of CD 227 [Ref 3.N].
Identifying technically simple pavement schemes (TSS)
E/2.16
Technically simple pavement schemes (TSS) require renewal of only the surface course and shall be

NOTE 1
TSS are lengths of carriageway where there are no structural problems; that is where pavement
deterioration is present but is confined to the surface course.

It is expected that a TSS can consist of a number of contiguous HAPMS sections that each meet the
selection criteria set out in Figure E/2.18.
E/2.16.1
The minimum length of a TSS should be 500 m.
E/2.16.2
All running lanes within the HAPMS sections making up the TSS should have the surface course
renewed, apart from substantial, continuous lengths of thin surface course systems (TSCS) that are
less than five years old.

Appendix E/A. Description of TRACS condition data
Appendix E/A. Description of TRACS condition data
E/A1
Introduction
Surveys on the strategic road network in England carried out under the TRAffic-speed condition survey
(TRACS) contract commenced in 2000. TRACS surveys are carried out using survey vehicles
equipped with lasers, video image collection and inertia measurement apparatus to enable surveys of
the road surface condition to be carried out whilst travelling at variable speeds, of up to 100 km/h, to
match prevailing traffic, and hence cause minimum disruption to other road users.
As the TRACS contracts have progressed, the parameters measured and reported within HAPMS have
changed as technology has moved on. This section provides a short description of each of the main
pavement-related parameters reported under the current TRACS contract. More information on
HAPMS is available to National Highways staff and authorised service providers.
E/A1.1
Location referencing
All data collected by TRACS survey vehicles are referenced to the network sections. The start and end
points of sections are defined by location reference points (LRPs) in HAPMS referencing.
E/A1.2
Geometry
Three measures of road geometry are delivered by the TRACS survey: gradient, crossfall, and radius
of curvature. Gradient and crossfall are delivered as percentages, whilst radius of curvature is in
metres. These measures are used primarily for the classification of site categories for assigning
investigatory levels of skidding resistance (see CS 228 [Ref 2.I]).
E/A1.3
Processing and reporting
TRACS survey data is delivered in raw form as TRACS raw condition data (RCD). The National
Highways machine survey pre-processor (MSP) software is used to process the RCD to generate the
TRACS base condition data (BCD). The TRACS BCD is loaded into HAPMS. HAPMS provides
maintenance engineers with access to the condition data collected from their network, and enables
them to identify potential maintenance schemes and to monitor network performance. The TRACS
BCD can be queried in HAPMS and reported using the database facilities, and can be displayed
against a map background.
E/A2
Texture depth
The surface texture depth measured by TRACS survey vehicles is the coarser element of macrotexture
and the finer element of megatexture formed by aggregate particles in the asphalt surfacing or by the
brushing or grooving of concrete surfacing. Texture depth contributes to skidding resistance, primarily
at medium and high speeds, in two ways. Firstly, it provides drainage paths to allow water to be
removed rapidly from the tyre/road interface. Secondly, the projections, which contribute to hysteresis
losses in the tyre, are an important factor in the braking process.
The MSP software calculates sensor-measured texture depth (SMTD) from the raw texture profile
measurements collected by TRACS survey vehicles for the near side wheel-track, and averages them
over 10-m lengths for storage as base data within HAPMS.
E/A3
Rut depth
To measure rut depth, TRACS survey vehicles record the transverse profile of the road surface at 200
points over a minimum width of 3.8 m using lasers. They also record the road marking profile over a
minimum width of 3.8 m and at the same transverse and longitudinal locations as the transverse profile.
The 200 transverse profile measurements are processed in MSP, which uses an algorithm to simulate
placing a notional 2-m straight edge on the recorded transverse profile, and measuring the largest
deviation from the straight edge to the transverse profile, excluding any measurements made on road

Appendix E/A. Description of TRACS condition data
markings. This calculation is carried out for each wheel-track. MSP calculates the average of the
individual rut depths for each wheel-track over 10-m lengths for storage within HAPMS.
The transverse profile measurement method of rut depth determination used by TRACS vehicles has
been shown to be highly comparable with the measurements made using a conventional straight edge
and wedge.
It is recommended that, where any length has been identified for further investigation as a result of
deep rut depths, that comparison be made between the left rut and right rut length weighted average
values contained within HAPMS. This is to check that there are no excessive differences which could
be caused by the inclusion of the edge line in the left or right rut measurements.
E/A4
Enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) and bump measure
E/A4.1
eLPV
The main parameter currently used for the assessment of ride quality, or profile unevenness, is the
enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) of individual deviations of the profile relative to a datum
obtained by removing (or filtering) longer wavelengths from the measured longitudinal profile. This
parameter was introduced in June 2004 and uses sophisticated filtering which removes the effects of
the pavement geometry (gradient, crossfall and curvature), which had previously caused high levels of
variance at, for example, the approaches to roundabouts. The previous simpler method of filtering
produced the parameter longitudinal profile variance (i.e. unenhanced).
The eLPV value reflects the unevenness associated with profile features that are equal to or less in
wavelength than the length of the filter used to calculate the eLPV. For example, the variance of
deviations from a 3-m filter reflects the unevenness of profile features with wavelengths equal to or less
than approximately 3 m.
The measurement of profile unevenness can be used to investigate the ride quality of the pavement.
The short, medium and long wavelength features that are found to relate with the perceived effect on
vehicle ride are represented by variance from 3 m, 10 m and 30 m filters respectively. The 3 m, 10 m
and 30 m eLPV values are calculated from the TRACS longitudinal profile measurements by MSP and
averaged over 10-m lengths for storage within HAPMS.
Extremes of 10-m eLPV may arise from poor reinstatements along the wheel-track, the presence of
high and/or variable levels of rutting, and bay length irregularities (in concrete roads). High levels of 30
m enhanced longitudinal profile variance may be associated with subsidence. Changes of crossfall
along the length of a road may also result in slightly higher 30 m eLPV being reported.
High levels of profile unevenness do not only affect ride quality. High levels of profile unevenness,
particularly in the 3-m and 10-m wavelength ranges, have been shown to contribute to increased
dynamic loading of the pavement, hence accelerating the deterioration of the road pavement.
Extremes of profile unevenness can also lead to increased stopping distances, and can have an
adverse effect on vehicle manoeuvrability and safety.
Research carried out on TRACS measurements has shown that TRACS survey vehicles may provide
eLPV data having lower levels of accuracy when surveying at slow speed, or under conditions of
significant acceleration or (more commonly) deceleration. To reduce the occurrence of low accuracy
data, limits have been specified for the TRACS surveys for speed and acceleration/deceleration
beyond which the data is considered invalid. Where these limits have been exceeded, the data is
marked as "unreliable" in the TRACS base eLPV data. The presence of a significant proportion of
unreliable values within any 100-m length results in missing values when the data is expressed as
100m-length weighted averages in HAPMS.
To distinguish between moving average LPV (reported prior to 1st June 2004) and eLPV, the TRACS
length weighted averages data source in HAPMS provides an additional label for the LPV data called
"enhanced". Where the label is not present this indicates that the value reported in the HAPMS TRACS
length weighted averages data source is the old moving average LPV.

E/A4.2
Bump measure
Research has shown that road users are also sensitive to short-length "bump" features that cause
jolt-like sensations within the vehicle. These features are not effectively identified using the eLPV
measure. Therefore a measure, called the "bump measure" was developed. The bump measure has
been designed to identify lengths of pavement containing short defects ("bumps"), such as sunken
ironwork, potholes, and poor joints. Such defects can cause jolting discomfort to the road user.
The bump measure is calculated from the longitudinal profile, and initially reported over 10-m lengths. It
reports either 0 or 1 for each reporting length, with a 1 indicating that the length contains one or more
bumps. 'Left bump' indicates whether there is one or more bumps in the left wheeltrack and 'right bump'
indicates whether there is one or more bumps in the right wheeltrack.
TRACS length-weighted average bump measure is reported over 100-m lengths and has a value of 0
or 1, where a 1 indicates that the length contains one or more bumps. The bump measure does not
give any indication of the number of bumps in the reporting length.
E/A5
Lane fretting intensity
TRACS "lane fretting" has been reported since January 2014. This replaced the TRACS "fretting"
parameter which was delivered between June 2004 and January 2014. The older fretting parameter
provided an indication of the amount of fretting present on HRA surfaced pavements only and was
calculated from the texture profile measured in the left wheelpath.
TRACS lane fretting has been introduced to improve the ability to identify fretting by using multiple
lasers across the width of the survey vehicle to provide a measure of the amount of fretting present on
the whole lane width. The parameter uses a different approach to calculating fretting so that the
measure is able to identify fretting on all asphalt surface types. The values reported by the measure are
not comparable to the values reported by the previous single line measure.
The lane fretting algorithm reports the intensity of lane fretting in the range 0 to 625. In general, the
higher the value of the fretting parameter, the more likely it is that there is fretting present at that
location on the network, and the more severe that fretting is likely to be. However, the way the
parameter is calculated means that the values actually quantify how different a local part of the
pavement is from its surroundings.
Significant weight should not be unduly applied to moderate proportional differences in the lane fretting
Intensity. For example it should not be assumed that lengths with lane fretting of 8 are twice as fretted
as lengths with lane fretting of 4. A value of lane fretting of 17.5 in one location is not necessarily more
fretted than a value of 16.4 in another place – both locations are probably fretted and should be
investigated.
It may not be possible to calculate a value of lane fretting intensity where the survey measurements
include a large area of road markings, or where a number of surfacing changes were identified within a
short distance of one another, or where the driving line of the survey vehicle deviated from the required
survey line and the data were flagged as being out of line by the survey contractor. The values are not
to be compared directly with measures obtained from manual visual condition surveys.

Appendix E/B. TRAffic-speed structural condition surveys (TRASS)
E/B1
Introduction
Non-invasive information on the structural condition of pavements can be provided from measuring the
deflection response under load. These measurements have been provided by the deflectograph and
the falling weight deflectometer (FWD). However these devices employ slow-moving (2.5 km/h) or
static measurement techniques that require traffic management and cause traffic disruption, which is
not ideal for routine network-level assessment.
In 2005, National Highways acquired a traffic speed deflectometer (TSD), developed in Denmark.
Following research and development into the operation of this equipment, network-level surveys
commenced with this machine on the English strategic road network in 2010 as part of National
Highways' first TRAffic-speed structural survey (TRASS) contract.
E/B1.1
Location referencing
All data collected by the TSD are referenced to the network sections. The start and end points of
sections are defined by location reference points (LRPs) in HAPMS referencing.
E/B1.2
Processing and reporting
TRASS data is delivered as raw condition data (RCD). National Highways' machine survey
pre-processor (MSP) software is then used to process the RCD, including checking of the data quality,
to generate TSD base condition data (BCD), which includes TSD slopes derived from the velocity
sensor measurements averaged over one-metre lengths. The TSD BCD can be queried in HAPMS and
reported using the database facilities, and can be displayed against a map background.
E/B2
TSD data collection / operation
The TSD comprises a complex array of instruments and recording equipment within an insulated,
temperature-controlled, steel container mounted on a single rear axle trailer assembly having a rear
axle load of approximately 10 tonnes.
Patented technology uses Doppler lasers, mounted in a stiff frame, to measure the velocity of the
deflection of the road surface at three positions in front of the loaded nearside twin rear wheels of the
trailer. A fourth velocity sensor, well in front of the loaded wheels, enables corrections to be made for
the movement of the vehicle. Other motion sensors enable further corrections for unwanted movement
of the mounting frame. Currently the equipment operates at a survey speed of between 50 and 80
km/h, with a target speed of 70 km/h.
The vertical deflection velocity measured at each point is scaled by the instantaneous survey velocity to
provide what is known as the TSD "slope", which is an indicator of the structural strength of the road.
This slope is sampled at around 1000 times a second (every 19 mm of travel at 70 km/h) and reported
over an average length of one metre.
Although the TSD does not measure the same response to load as the deflectograph, research has
shown that a fairly strong relationship exists between the TSD slope and the peak deflection measured
by the deflectograph in the nearside wheel-track. The research and development has also continued to
identify and implement improvements to the machine operating procedures and its systems to support
routine network surveys. These include the addition of a climate control system to reduce the influence
of thermal gradients on the measuring beam and more robust distance and survey velocity measuring
systems.
TSD surveys are carried out in accordance with standard operating procedures intended to ensure that
climatic and machine conditions are suitable for reliable data to be obtained. For example, surveys do
not provide valid data when the road surface is wet. The valid operating speed of the TSD has
constrained upper and lower limits. This is so that data that is sufficiently robust for network level use
can be obtained without need for correction of the results for the effect of vehicle speed.

E/B3
Data analysis
The analysis of TRASS data is carried out within HAPMS and creates outputs at a base reporting length
of 100 m. If the total length of a HAPMS section is not an exact multiple of 100 m then an output is also
provided for the final sub-100 m length of the section. The analysis procedure uses an algorithm to
convert each of the 1-m TSD slopes in the reporting length to an estimated peak deflectograph value.
The corresponding construction information held in HAPMS is used to calculate the "characteristic base
type" (CBT) for each 100-m length. This can be "BITS", "CEMT" or "GNCA" following the same rules
for classifying base types as used for deflectograph analysis in HAPMS as described in CS 229 [Ref
1.N]. The CBT of a reporting length is defined as the base type present for the majority of that length.
The estimated peak deflectograph values together with the construction and traffic information are used
to calculate the network structural condition (NSC) category as described in Section E/2.
It should be noted that at the present time the analysis does not include correction of TSD slope values
for the influence of survey speed or pavement temperature.
Further details of the analysis are provided in the HAPMS documentation, available to National
Highways staff and authorised service providers.
E/B4
Data quality
The analysis of TRASS survey data is only valid for flexible pavements, with the robustness of the
reported results being critically dependent on the availability of accurate construction and traffic data in
HAPMS. Service providers should therefore ensure that this information is sufficiently accurate before
using TRASS data in the planning of scheme level investigations.
A null NSC category is reported for 100-m lengths when it is not possible for HAPMS to complete the
analysis procedure satisfactorily. This includes where valid TSD data are not available for the reporting
length. This occurs for HAPMS sections where TRASS surveys have not been undertaken (for
example roundabouts) or where the TRASS survey data is invalid (for example if they are undertaken
outside of the required speed range). In these cases the TSD slope value is also reported as "null".
While the reported 85th percentile slope values are not currently to be used for maintenance
assessment planning, their presence is an indication that valid TRASS data has been collected for the
corresponding 100-m length. It is possible for valid TSD data to be present but the NSC category to be
reported as "null". This occurs where pavement quality concrete is present, where the construction is
too thin to meet the classification criteria for BITS or CEMT base types, or where there is a lack of valid
traffic information.
Where the NSC category is reported as null, the construction and traffic data held in HAPMS should be
reviewed and updated if appropriate before rerunning the TRASS analysis procedure in HAPMS.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland-specific
requirements for routine, network-level surveys of pavement surface condition and structural condition.
It sets out the requirements for reviewing the outputs from these surveys in order to identify lengths of
carriageway that are potentially in need of maintenance and that require a detailed assessment. It does
not cover the routine measurement of skidding resistance which is dealt with in CS 228 [Ref 6.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

NI/1. Network level surveys
NOTE 3
The TRACS cracking measure was introduced in 2018 and there are currently no guidance levels for
interpretation of this parameter.
NOTE 4
TRACS also measures retroreflectivity of road markings. Inspection and maintenance of road markings
is covered in CS 126 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 5
TRACS also collects high quality downward and forward facing images. These images provide
information that can be used for detailed visual condition surveys of the carriageway as described in CS
229 [Ref 1.N] and for the network visual assessment of rigid pavements, as described in this document.
NOTE 6
Detailed guidance on the TRACS parameters is provided in the TRACS guidance documents available
through National Highways staff at: http://hawacphap013/hapms/.
TRACS texture depth, rut depth and eLPV
TRACS condition categories
NI/1.10
TRACS texture depth, rut depth and enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) data shall be
assessed against the four condition categories defined in Table NI/1.10.
Table NI/1.10 Condition categories for TRACS texture depth, rut depth and eLPV
Condition category
Definition
1
Sound – negligible deterioration.
2
Some deterioration – low level of concern.

the PMS.
NOTE 2
Texture is reported on all surface types.
NOTE 3
Changes in texture depth can indicate a potential loss of skid resistance. Advice on the interpretation of
texture depth data in connection with skid resistance is given in CS 228 [Ref 6.N].
NOTE 4
Lower texture depth values are applied to HFS due to the different way in which skid resistance is
provided by these materials.
NOTE 5
The texture depth of HFS can only be in condition category 1 or 2.

NOTE 1
The categories apply to the 100-m TRACS length weighted (LW) average maximum eLPV values as
reported in the PMS.
NOTE 2
The three eLPV measures reported in the PMS indicate the level of profile unevenness within
wavelength ranges less than or equal to 3 m, 10 m and 30 m. These values are broadly correlated to
levels of ride comfort (ride quality).
NOTE 3
The eLPV values are set to reflect the standard of ride quality required on different types of road. For
example, motorways require a better standard of ride quality than urban single carriageways.
NOTE 4
The road classifications are based on the road classifications in the PMS.
TRACS lane fretting intensity
NI/1.14
TRACS lane fretting Intensity shall be assessed against the guidance values shown in Table NI/1.14.
Table NI/1.14 Guidance values for TRACS lane fretting intensity (100m lengths)
Description
Lane fretting intensity
Very low or no fretting
<2
Likely to be low fretting over long lengths
or
moderate fretting over a short length
2≤[lane fretting] <10
Likely to be moderate fretting over long lengths
or
severe fretting over a short length
10≤[lane fretting] <20
Likely to be severe patches of fretting
≥20
NOTE 1
The categories apply to the 100-m TRACS length weighted (LW) average lane fretting intensity values
as reported by HAPMS.
NOTE 2
TRACS lane fretting intensity applies to all asphalt surfaces.
NOTE 3
TRACS lane fretting intensity is reported within the range 0 to 625.
TRACS bump measure
NI/1.15
The TRACS bump measure shall be used to identify lengths containing short defects ("bumps") that are
not effectively identified from eLPV.
NOTE 1
The parameter is reported as 100-m TRACS length weighted average bump measure.
NOTE 2
"Bumps" can cause jolt-like sensations within vehicles. Examples of "bumps" include sunken ironwork,
potholes and poor transverse joints.
NOTE 3
The bump measure is reported as either 0 or 1. 1 indicates that the length contains one or more
"bumps".

NI/1. Network level surveys
TRACS surface type and noise
NI/1.16
TRACS surface type and noise shall be used to provide additional information about lengths of
pavement that have been identified as potentially being in need of maintenance.
NI/1.16.1
The TRACS surface type provides a prediction of the surface type based on texture data and luminosity
of the surface. The measure may be used to cross check the accuracy of the surface construction
records in the PMS.
NI/1.16.2
The TRACS noise measure provides a prediction of the noise levels generated by the surface/tyre
interaction based on texture and the TRACS surface type. The noise measure may be used to aid the
investigation of noise levels.
TRACS network visual condition assessment of rigid pavements
NI/1.17
TRACS downward facing images shall be reviewed and used to carry out a network visual condition
assessment of each running lane for all jointed rigid pavements and continuously reinforced concrete
pavements (CRCP).
NOTE 1
For jointed rigid pavements, the assessment is based on the percentage of bays that have cracked,
broken or been replaced in each 100-m length in each lane.
NOTE 2
For jointed unreinforced pavements, a bay is considered to be cracked or broken if it contains one or
more of the following defects:
1) a crack >0.5 mm wide crossing a bay transversely or longitudinally;
2) an intersection of transverse and longitudinal cracks;
3) wide corner cracking.
NOTE 3
For jointed reinforced pavements, a bay is considered to be cracked or broken when the total length of
cracks (>1.5 mm wide) exceeds the width of the bay.
NOTE 4
For CRCP, the assessment is based on the number of significant defects per 100-m length in each lane
(see CS 229 [Ref 1.N]] for the definition of significant defects).
NI/1.18
A procedure shall be put in place for reviewing the network at least once every three years.
NOTE
The review can be done by reviewing one third of the network each year or all of the network every
three years.
NI/1.19
The level of visual defects that shall be used to define condition category are given in Table NI/1.19.

Review of data (CS 230, 4.1)
NI/2.1
SCANNER and deflectograph condition data, obtained from the Pavement Management System
(PMS), and the additional data described in CS 230 [Ref 4.N]and CD 227 [Ref 2.N] shall be collated
and reviewed on an annual basis in order to identify lengths of pavement that are showing signs of
deterioration.
NI/2.2
TRACS condition data, where relevant, and the additional data described in DMRB CD 227 [Ref 2.N]
shall be collated and reviewed on an annual basis in order to identify lengths of pavement that are
showing signs of deterioration.
NI/2.3
The review of this data shall be used to select lengths of the network that warrant detailed investigation
in order to determine the causes and extent of the deterioration.
NOTE 1
Isolated short (100 m) lengths which are exhibiting slight levels of deterioration are unlikely to require
further investigation.
NOTE 2
Lengths which are exhibiting significant levels of deterioration or adjacent lengths that are exhibiting
moderate levels of deterioration are likely to require further investigation.
TRACS data
NI/2.4
The PMS database contains current and historical TRACS data. For the network review, TRACS
condition data (100-m reporting length) shall be obtained from the PMS using the most recent TRACS
length weighted average (LWAVG) data source.
NI/2.4.1
TRACS data from earlier surveys may also be used to provide additional information on the rate of
change of condition.
NOTE 1
Time series analysis can be useful in determining how quickly pavements are deteriorating.
NOTE 2
Some of the parameters have changed how they are reported over time and it is not appropriate to
directly compare values for these parameters.
NOTE 3
Further information on the evolution of the TRACS condition parameters is available through contacting
National Highways.

Appendix NI/A. Description of TRACS condition data
Appendix NI/A. Description of TRACS condition data
NI/A1
Introduction
TRACS surveys are carried out using survey vehicles equipped with lasers, video image collection and
inertia measurement apparatus to enable surveys of the road surface condition to be carried out whilst
travelling at variable speeds, of up to 100km/h, to match prevailing traffic, and hence cause minimum
disruption to other road users.
This section provides a short description of each of the main pavement-related parameters reported
under the current TRACS contract.
NI/A1.1
Location referencing
All data collected by TRACS survey vehicles are referenced to the network sections. The start and end
points of sections are defined by location reference points (LRPs) for referencing purposes.
NI/A1.2
Geometry
Three measures of road geometry are delivered by the TRACS survey: gradient, crosswalk, and radius
of curvature. Gradient and crossfall are delivered as percentages, whilst radius of curvature is in
metres. These measures are used primarily for the classification of site categories for assigning
investigatory levels of skidding resistance (see DMRB CS 228 [Ref 6.N]).
NI/A1.3
Processing and reporting
TRACS survey data is delivered in raw form as TRACS raw condition data (RCD). The machine survey
pre-processor (MSP) software is used to process the RCD to generate the TRACS base condition data
(BCD). The TRACS BCD is loaded into the PMS. The PMS provides maintenance engineers with
access to the condition data collected from their network, and enables them to identify potential
maintenance schemes and to monitor network performance. The TRACS BCD can be queried in the
Pavement Management System (PMS) and reported using the database facilities, and can be
displayed against a map background.
NI/A2
Texture depth
The surface texture depth measured by TRACS survey vehicles is the coarser element of macrotexture
and the finer element of megatexture formed by aggregate particles in the asphalt surfacing or by the
brushing or grooving of concrete surfacing. Texture depth contributes to skidding resistance, primarily
at medium and high speeds, in two ways. Firstly, it provides drainage paths to allow water to be
removed rapidly from the tyre/road interface. Secondly, the projections, which contribute to hysteresis
losses in the tyre, are an important factor in the braking process.
The MSP software calculates sensor measured texture depth (SMTD) from the raw texture profile
measurements collected by TRACS survey vehicles for the near side wheel-track and averages them
over 10-m lengths for storage as base data within the PMS.
NI/A3
Rut depth
To measure rut depth, TRACS survey vehicles record the transverse profile of the road surface at 200
points over a minimum width of 3.8 m using lasers. They also record the road marking profile over a
minimum width of 3.8 m and at the same transverse and longitudinal locations as the transverse profile.
The 200 transverse profile measurements are processed in MSP, which uses an algorithm to simulate
placing a notional 2-m straight edge on the recorded transverse profile, and measuring the largest
deviation from the straight edge to the transverse profile, excluding any measurements made on road
markings. This calculation is carried out for each wheel-track. MSP calculates the average of the
individual rut depths for each wheel-track over 10-m lengths for storage within the PMS.

Appendix NI/A. Description of TRACS condition data
The transverse profile measurement method of rut depth determination used by TRACS vehicles has
been shown to be highly comparable with the measurements made using a conventional straight edge
and wedge.
It is recommended that, where any length has been identified for further investigation as a result of
deep rut depths, that comparison be made between the left rut and right rut length weighted average
values contained within the PMS. This is to check that there are no excessive differences which could
be caused by the inclusion of the edge line in the left or right rut measurements.
NI/A4
Enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) and bump measure
NI/A4.1
eLPV
The main parameter currently used for the assessment of ride quality, or profile unevenness, is the
enhanced longitudinal profile variance (eLPV) of individual deviations of the profile relative to a datum
obtained by removing (or filtering) longer wavelengths from the measured longitudinal profile. This
parameter was introduced in June 2004 and uses sophisticated filtering which removes the effects of
the pavement geometry (gradient, crossfall and curvature), which had previously caused high levels of
variance at, for example, the approaches to roundabouts. The previous simpler method of filtering
produced the parameter longitudinal profile variance (that is, unenhanced).
The eLPV value reflects the unevenness associated with profile features that are equal to or less in
wavelength than the length of the filter used to calculate the eLPV. For example, the variance of
deviations from a 3-m filter reflects the unevenness of profile features with wavelengths equal to or less
than approximately 3 m.
The measurement of profile unevenness can be used to investigate the ride quality of the pavement.
The short, medium and long wavelength features that are found to relate with the perceived effect on
vehicle ride are represented by variance from 3-m, 10-m and 30-m filters respectively. The 3-m, 10-m
and 30-m eLPV values are calculated from the TRACS longitudinal profile measurements by MSP and
averaged over 10-m lengths for storage within the PMS.
Extremes of 10-m eLPV may arise from poor reinstatements along the wheel-track, the presence of
high and/or variable levels of rutting, and bay length irregularities (in concrete roads). High levels of
30-m enhanced longitudinal profile variance may be associated with subsidence. Changes of crossfall
along the length of a road may also result in slightly higher 30-m eLPV being reported.
High levels of profile unevenness do not only affect ride quality. High levels of profile unevenness,
particularly in the 3-m and 10-m wavelength ranges, have been shown to contribute to increased
dynamic loading of the pavement, hence accelerating the deterioration of the road pavement.
Extremes of profile unevenness can also lead to increased stopping distances, and can have an
adverse effect on vehicle manoeuvrability and safety.
Research carried out on TRACS measurements has shown that TRACS survey vehicles may provide
eLPV data having lower levels of accuracy when surveying at slow speed, or under conditions of
significant acceleration or (more commonly) deceleration. To reduce the occurrence of low accuracy
data, limits have been specified for the TRACS surveys for speed and acceleration/deceleration
beyond which the data is considered invalid. Where these limits have been exceeded, the data is
marked as "unreliable" in the TRACS base eLPV data. The presence of a significant proportion of
unreliable values within any 100-m length results in missing values when the data is expressed as
100-m length weighted averages in the PMS.
To distinguish between moving average LPV (reported prior to 1st June 2004) and eLPV, the TRACS
length weighted averages data source in HAPMS provides an additional label for the LPV data called
"enhanced". Where the label is not present this indicates that the value reported in the the PMS
TRACS length weighted averages data source is the old moving average LPV.
NI/A4.2
Bump measure
Research has shown that road users are also sensitive to short length "bump" features that cause
jolt-like sensations within the vehicle. These features are not effectively identified using the eLPV

Appendix NI/A. Description of TRACS condition data
measure. Therefore a measure, called the "bump measure" was developed. The bump measure has
been designed to identify lengths of pavement containing short defects ("bumps"), such as sunken
ironwork, potholes, and poor joints. Such defects can cause jolting discomfort to the road user.
The bump measure is calculated from the longitudinal profile, and initially reported over 10-m lengths. It
reports either 0 or 1 for each reporting length, with a 1 indicating that the length contains one or more
bumps.'Left bump' indicates whether there is one or more bumps in the left wheeltrack and 'right bump'
indicates whether there is one or more bumps in the right wheeltrack.
TRACS length-weighted average bump measure is reported over 100-m lengths and has a value of 0
or 1, where a 1 indicates that the length contains one or more bumps. The bump measure does not
give any indication of the number of bumps in the reporting length.
NI/A5
Lane fretting intensity
TRACS "lane fretting" has been reported since January 2014. This replaced the TRACS "fretting"
parameter which was delivered between June 2004 and January 2014. The older fretting parameter
provided an indication of the amount of fretting present on HRA surfaced pavements only and was
calculated from the texture profile measured in the left wheeltrack.
TRACS lane fretting has been introduced to improve the ability to identify fretting by using multiple
lasers across the width of the survey vehicle to provide a measure of the amount of fretting present on
the whole lane width. The parameter uses a different approach to calculating fretting so that the
measure is able to identify fretting on all asphalt surface types. The values reported by the measure are
not comparable to the values reported by the previous single line measure.
The lane fretting algorithm reports the intensity of lane fretting in the range 0 to 625. In general, the
higher the value of the fretting parameter, the more likely it is that there is fretting present at that
location on the network, and the more severe that fretting is likely to be. However, the way the
parameter is calculated means that the values actually quantify how different a local part of the
pavement is from its surroundings.
Significant weight should not be unduly applied to moderate proportional differences in the lane fretting
Intensity. For example it should not be assumed that lengths with lane fretting of 8 are twice as fretted
as lengths with lane fretting of 4. A value of lane fretting of 17.5 in one location is not necessarily more
fretted than a value of 16.4 in another place – both locations are probably fretted and should be
investigated.
It may not be possible to calculate a value of lane fretting intensity where the survey measurements
include a large area of road markings, or where a number of surfacing changes were identified within a
short distance of one another, or where the driving line of the survey vehicle deviated from the required
survey line and the data were flagged as being out of line by the survey contractor. The values are not
to be compared directly with measures obtained from manual visual condition surveys.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This national application annex gives the Transport Scotland-specific requirements for routine,
network-level surveys of pavement surface condition and structural condition. It sets out the
requirements for reviewing the outputs from these surveys in order to identify lengths of carriageway
that are potentially in need of maintenance and that require a detailed assessment. It does not cover
the routine measurement of skidding resistance, which is dealt with in DMRB CS 228 [Ref 6.N].
This document also sets out the requirements for identifying technically simple pavement schemes
(TSS). Technically simple pavement schemes are lengths of carriageway where there are no structural
problems i.e. where deterioration is confined to the surface course. These schemes will require renewal
of only the surface course and are subject to a simplified development and assessment process.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.

S/2.1
SCANNER and deflectograph condition data, obtained from the Transport Scotland pavement
management system (PMS), and the additional data described in CS 230 [Ref 5.N]and CD 227 NAA(S)
[Ref 1.N] shall be collated and reviewed on an annual basis in order to identify lengths of pavement that
are showing signs of deterioration.
S/2.2
SCANNER and deflectograph data for texture depth, rutting, LPV, cracks and deflection shall be
assessed against the condition categories defined in Table S/1.5.
NOTE
Time series analysis can be useful in determining how quickly pavements are deteriorating.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This national application annex gives the Welsh Government (WG) requirements for routine,
network-level surveys of pavement surface condition and structural condition. It sets out the
requirements for reviewing the outputs from these surveys in order to identify lengths of carriageway
that are potentially in need of maintenance and that require a detailed assessment. It does not cover
the routine measurement of skidding resistance which is dealt with in DMRB CS 228 [Ref 1.I].
This document also sets out the requirements for identifying technically simple pavement schemes
(TSS). Technically simple pavement schemes are lengths of carriageway where there are minimal
structural problems i.e. where deterioration is mainly confined to the surface course. These schemes
will require renewal of the surface course and are subject to a simplified development and assessment
process.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

Network level surveys
Surface condition surveys (CS 230, 2.2)
Network level road condition surveys contract and parameters
W/1.1
Network level road condition surveys on the WG motorway and all-purpose trunk road network, shall be
undertaken as part of the Integrated Roads Information System (IRIS) contract or future alternatives
managed by Welsh Government.
W/1.2
Network level road condition surveys shall include:
1) SCANNER;
2) Deflectograph; and,
3) Skidding resistance (referred to as SCRIM).
NOTE 1
SCANNER has been developed by the UK Roads Board (now UKRLG) to provide a consistent method
of measuring the surface condition of carriageways. Full details are given in the 5-volume User Guide
and Specifications published by the UK Roads Board (2011).
NOTE 2
Details of accredited devices are available on the UKRLG website at the following link:
https://ukrlg.ciht.org.uk/ukrlg-home/guidance/road-condition-information/data-collection/scanner/
NOTE 3
The survey coverage and frequency are documented in the IRIS contract. These network level surveys
will be undertaken as follows:
1) Lane 1 on the motorway and dual carriageway network;
2) both lanes of the single carriageway network;
3) Lane 1 of slip roads; and,
4) roundabouts are not included.
W/1.3
All survey data produced by the survey shall be capable of being loaded into IRIS and be controlled by a
detailed quality assurance procedure for the surveys, which includes the processing of the survey data.
W/1.4
The SCANNER surveys will be undertaken within the appropriate financial year; however, no surveys
shall be be undertaken in December and January unless explicitly agreed by WG.
W/1.5
The SCANNER survey shall capture the full list of parameters detailed in the SCANNER specifications,
including:
1) rutting and transverse profile;
2) longitudinal profile: 3 m and 10 m. Enhanced longitudinal profile;
3) sensor measured texture depth;
4) whole carriageway cracking;
5) alignment, including curvature, cross-fall and gradient;
6) GPS; and,
7) forward facing video.
NOTE
Road geometry measurements are used to assist in the assessment of site category and investigatory
levels of skidding resistance. See DMRB CS 228 [Ref 1.I].
W/1.6
Primary reporting from SCANNER shall be the 10-m data, and 100-m summary data. The 10-m data
will be used for asset management purposes, and the 100-m data used with other condition data for the
management of works programmes.
W/1.7
The SCANNER rut depth, texture depth, longitudinal profile variance (LPV) and cracking data shall be
assessed individually and collectively against the three condition categories defined in Table W/1.7.

NOTE 3
100-m texture depth >1.5 mm will be considered category 2.
NOTE 4
Changes in texture depth can indicate a potential loss of skid resistance. Advice on the interpretation of
texture depth data in connection with skid resistance is given in CS 228 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 5
Lower texture depth values are applied to HFS due to the different way in which skid resistance is
provided by these materials. The texture depth of HFS can only be in condition category 1 or 2.

The categories apply to the 100-m length weighted average texture eLPV as reported by IRIS. This
data is held in the SCANNER Defects RP701 Summary tables, and is reported in both wheel-paths,
and as a lane measurement.
NOTE 2
The eLPV measures reported in IRIS indicate the level of profile unevenness within the wavelengths
≤ssthanequal →3 m or 10 m. 30-m eLPV is not reported in IRIS.
NOTE 3
The eLPV values are set to reflect the standard of ride quality required on different types of road. For
example, motorways require a better standard of ride quality than urban single carriageways.
NOTE 4
The road classifications are based on the speed limit and the carriageway types in IRIS.
NOTE 5
Research into measurement of texture variability is being undertaken. It is anticipated that these
measurements will be used to determine the variability of texture depth, as an indicator of fretting and
early failures.

Review of data (CS 230, 4.1)
W/2.1
SCANNER and Deflectograph condition data along with the additional data described in CS 230 [Ref
4.N], shall be collated and reviewed to identify lengths of pavement that are showing signs of
deterioration.
W/2.2
All reviewed machine-based survey data, shall be used to assist in identifying lengths of the network
that warrant detailed investigation in order to determine the causes and extent of the deterioration.
W/2.3
The 10-m summary data shall be used to complement the 100-m summary data as part of this review,
with individual parameters used to determine the mode of deterioration and the most suitable treatment
processes to restore service life of the carriageway.
NOTE 1
This process may be significantly aided by an IRIS which can run multiple queries and combine
data-sets from different survey types into one query.
NOTE 2
Short isolated lengths (100 m) exhibiting slight levels of deterioration are unlikely to require further
investigation.
NOTE 3
Lengths of carriageway exhibiting significant levels of deterioration or adjacent lengths that are
exhibiting moderate levels of structural deterioration are likely to require further investigation.
SCANNER data
W/2.4
Only the most current data available from IRIS PMS, must be used for the initial network review.
W/2.4.1
Previous year's data may be used to provide an indication of the rate of change of condition.
NOTE 1
Deterioration modelling can be useful in determining how quickly pavements can deteriorate.
NOTE 2
Some of the parameters have changed how they are reported over time and it is not appropriate to
directly compare values for these parameters.
NOTE 3
The analysis of the rate of change of data over time is an excellent way of determining deterioration, as
is the use of additional data sets that can be derived from the raw data collected by SCANNER survey
vehicles.
Texture, rutting and LPV
W/2.5
SCANNER data for texture depth, rutting and ride quality shall be assessed against the four condition
categories defined in Table W/1.12.
W/2.6
Any 100-m length in condition category 4 shall be assessed as showing signs of deterioration.
W/2.7
Any two 100-m lengths in condition category 3 within 1 km of one another shall be assessed as
showing signs of deterioration.
Deflectograph data
W/2.8
For the network review, Deflectograph condition data (100-m reporting length) shall be obtained from
IRIS PMS using the most recent deflectograph data source.
NOTE
The IRIS PMS database contains current and historical deflectograph data.
W/2.9
The structural condition of each 100-m reporting length shall be assigned one of the five levels of
structural condition as defined in Table W/1.22.
NOTE
Deflectograph survey data can be used to assist in the identification of pavement schemes.
Identifying lengths suitable for maintenance scheme planning
W/2.10
Technically simple pavement schemes (TSS) are lengths of carriageway where there are no structural
problems, i.e. where pavement deterioration is present but is confined to the upper layers. These
schemes require renewal of only the surface and binder course and shall be subject to a simplified
development and assessment process.

W/2. Review of data (CS 230, 4.1)
NOTE
Isolated areas of structural deterioration that require deeper treatment can be included within TSS,
provided they are less than 10% of the scheme area.
W/2.11
TSS shall not include lengths of pavement over structures or rigid pavement (including those with
overlays).
Deeper treatments
W/2.12
Areas requiring deeper treatment within a TSS, shall be included, providing the defects cover less than
10% of the scheme area and the works cost associated with the deeper work is less than £100k
(excluding the surface and binder course). Clear evidence that the work proposed to address the
structural problem is appropriate will form part of the scheme submission.
NOTE
The evidence can include results from previous investigations on the scheme and from similar scheme
scenarios where treatments have performed well.
W/2.13
Where there is clear evidence that structural deterioration exceeds the requirements of W2.9, then the
scheme shall be classed as a technically complex scheme and be investigated in accordance with CD
227 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
Assessment of characteristic skid coefficients and investigatory levels is set out in CS 228 [Ref 1.I].
Design of technically simple pavement schemes
W/2.14
Where the decision is taken to proceed with a technically simple pavement scheme, the surfacing shall
be designed in accordance with Section 4 of CD 227 [Ref 2.N].
W/2.15
Any short lengths within the technically simple pavement schemes that require deeper treatment (within
the limits of W/2.22) shall be designed in accordance with Section 5 of CD 227 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
All planned schemes are listed and prioritised within the 'WG Value Management Process, which can
be provided upon request to WG Pavement Team.

Appendix W/A. Description of SCANNER condition data
Appendix W/A. Description of SCANNER condition data
W/A1
W/A1.1
Introduction
SCANNER surveys are carried out using survey vehicles equipped with lasers, video image collection
and inertia measurement apparatus to enable surveys of the road surface condition to be carried out
whilst travelling at variable speeds, of up to 100 km/h, to match prevailing traffic, and hence cause
minimum disruption to other road users.
As the SCANNER survey vehicles have progressed, the parameters measured and available to be
reported via PMS have changed as the technology has moved on. This appendix provides a short
description of each of the main pavement-related parameters available under the current SCANNER
specification together with other useful parameters, similar to TRACS parameter. More information on
available techniques will be available from the survey contractor.
W/A1.2
Location referencing
All data collected by SCANNER survey vehicles is referenced to the network sections. The start and
end points of sections are defined by using the IRIS referencing system.
W/A1.3
Geometry
Three measures of road geometry are delivered by the SCANNER survey: gradient, cross-fall, and
radius of curvature. Gradient and cross-fall are delivered as percentages, whilst radius of curvature is
in metres. These measures are used primarily for the classification of site categories for assigning
investigatory levels of skidding resistance (see DMRB CS 228 [Ref 1.I])
W/A1.4
Processing and reporting
SCANNER survey data is delivered either by loading directly into WG IRIS or by other agreed format
such and HMDIF or CSV files to allow the client to load the data. IRIS provides maintenance engineers
with access to the condition data collected from their network and enables them to identify potential
maintenance schemes and to monitor network performance. The SCANNER parameters and national
indicator weighting sets derived from SCANNER data can be queried in IRIS and reported using the
database facilities, and can be displayed against a map background.
W/A2
Texture depth
The surface texture depth measured by SCANNER survey vehicles is the coarser element of
macro-texture and the finer element of megatexture formed by aggregate particles in the asphalt
surfacing or by the brushing or grooving of concrete surfacing. Texture depth contributes to skidding
resistance, primarily at medium and high speeds, in two ways. Firstly, it provides drainage paths to
allow water to be removed rapidly from the tyre/road interface. Secondly, the projections, which
contribute to hysteresis losses in the tyre, are an important factor in the braking process. The UKPMS
software calculates sensor measured texture depth (SMTD) from the raw texture profile measurements
collected by SCANNER survey vehicles for the near side wheel-track and averages them over 10-m
lengths for storage as base data within the PMS database.
W/A3
Rut depth
To measure rut depth, SCANNER survey vehicles use scanning lasers to record the transverse profile
of the road surface at a minimum of 22 points over a minimum width of 3.2 m and a maximum width of
3.8 m. The transverse profile measurements are processed, using an algorithm to simulate placing a
notional 2-m straight edge on the recorded transverse profile, and measuring the largest deviation from
the straight edge to the transverse profile, excluding any measurements made on road markings. This
calculation is carried out for each wheel-track. The software calculates the average of the individual rut
depths for each wheel-track over 10-m lengths for storage within the client's PMS.

======================================================================
Appendix W/A. Description of SCANNER condition data
The transverse profile measurement method of rut depth determination used by SCANNER vehicles
has been shown to be highly comparable with the measurements made using a conventional straight
edge and wedge.
It is recommended that, where any length has been identified for further investigation as a result of
deep rut depths, that comparison be made between the left rut and right rut length weighted average
values contained within the PMS database. This is to check that there are no excessive differences
which could be caused by the inclusion of the edge line or verge in the left or right rut measurements
W/A4
Longitudinal profile variance
The main parameter currently used for the assessment of ride quality, or profile unevenness, is the
enhanced longitudinal profile variance (LPV) of individual deviations of the profile relative to a datum
obtained by removing (or filtering) longer wavelengths from the measured longitudinal profile.
For example, the variance of deviations from a 3-m filter reflects the unevenness of profile features with
wavelengths equal to or less than approximately 3 m. The measurement of profile unevenness can be
used to investigate the ride quality of the pavement. The short, medium and long wavelength features
that are found to relate with the perceived effect on vehicle ride are represented by variance from 3-m,
10-m and 30-m filters respectively. Due to the nature of the A Road network the 30-m filter is not
recommended for use, but it can still be derived from the raw data if required. LPV values are
calculated from the SCANNER longitudinal profile measurements by the processing software and
averaged over 10 m lengths for storage within PMS database.
Extremes of 3 m LPV may arise from poor reinstatements along the wheel-track, the presence of high
and/or variable levels of rutting, and indicate localised failures on evolved rural roads. Extremes of 10
m LPV may also arise from poor reinstatements along the wheel-track, the presence of high and/or
variable levels of rutting, the presence of inverted crowns or cambers around junctions and underlying
substrate issues on evolved rural roads. High levels of 30 m enhanced longitudinal profile variance
may be associated with subsidence particularly in areas of high/fluctuating water tables.
High levels of profile unevenness, particularly in the 3-m and 10-m wavelength ranges, have been
shown to contribute to increased dynamic loading of the pavement, hence accelerating the
deterioration of the road pavement. Extremes of profile unevenness can also lead to increased
stopping distances, and can have an adverse effect on vehicle manoeuvrability and safety.
Research carried out on SCANNER measurements has shown that some SCANNER survey vehicles
provide LPV data having lower levels of accuracy when surveying at slow speed, or under conditions of
significant acceleration or (more commonly) deceleration. To reduce the occurrence of low accuracy
data, limits have been specified for the SCANNER surveys for speed and acceleration/deceleration
beyond which the data is considered invalid. These limits will be shown on the TRL Accreditation
Certificate for the survey vehicle and will potentially affect the survey coverage and potentially
compliance with Table 4.12 of the SCANNER Specification.
W/A5
Lane fretting intensity
The latest NH TRACS specification has introduced a measure for lane fretting intensity, the width of the
survey vehicle to provide a measure of the amount of fretting present on the whole lane width. The
parameter uses an approach to calculating fretting that is able to identify fretting on all asphalt surface
types and is able to quantify how different a local part of the pavement is from its surroundings.
Depending on the survey machine set up it is possible to derive a lane fretting intensity from SCANNER
survey data.
