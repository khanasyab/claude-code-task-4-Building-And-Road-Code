Introduction
Introduction
Background
Accidental collisions of large goods vehicles with the supports and superstructures of highway bridges
can occur. The Highways Agency (now Highways England) released BD 48 (DMRB 3.4.7) detailing the
requirements for the assessment and strengthening of bridge supports that were considered to be
particularly at risk with respect to collision loads.
Subsequently IAN 91/07 concluded that the strengthening or protection of bridge supports, other than
those 'particularly at risk', does not represent best value for money in terms of making roads safer. It
suspended the strengthening and protection of all bridge supports, other than those particularly at risk
and directs project sponsors to the Structures Technical Approval Authority (TAA) for advice and
suggests that a very small percentage of supports will be in this category.
This document contains the prioritisation, the loading (including broad principles for its application) and
some specific guidelines for the assessment and any subsequent strengthening and protection of
bridge supports.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

Robustness
The ability of a structure to withstand events like fire, explosions, impact
or the consequences of human error, without being damaged to an
extent disproportionate to the original cause.
Smart Motorway Scheme
Smart motorways is the generic term for motorways where technology is
combined with operating procedures to actively control traffic flow.
Techniques such as varying the speed limits, making the hard shoulder
available to traffic and ramp metering are used to make journey times
more reliable, improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the assessment of existing bridge supports.
NOTE 1
This document does not cover the assessment of geotechnical structures, such as corrugated-steel
buried structures or reinforced soil abutments.
NOTE 2
The assessment of CCTV masts, lighting columns, sign and signal gantries and pipe bridges are not
within the scope of this document.
1.2
Where the traffic flow underneath an existing bridge has or is anticipated to significantly increase (e.g.
following the introduction of a smart motorway scheme) this document shall be used for the
assessment of the bridge supports.
1.3
The intention behind these requirements is that the overall structural integrity of the bridge shall be
maintained following an impact but that local damage to a part of the bridge support can be accepted.
1.4
For bridges other than highway or foot/cycle track bridges, such as rail bridges, over a highway, the
application of this document shall be agreed with the authority responsible for the bridge.
1.5
Where foot/cycle track bridge ramps and stairs are structurally independent of the main
highway-spanning structure and do not span over the highway themselves, their supports shall not be
assessed for the enhanced collision loading.
Implementation
1.6
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving bridge supports on the
Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 2.N].
Use of GG 101
1.7
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Prioritisation
2.
Prioritisation
2.1
All supports shall be categorised into one of the following 3 groups in accordance with Figure A1.1 in
Appendix A:
1) Group 1 - "Particularly at risk" supports.
2) Group 2 - "At Risk" supports.
3) Group 3 - "Low Risk" supports.
Group 1 supports
2.2
Supports in group 1 shall be divided into two subgroups in accordance with figure A1.1.
2.3
Group 1a supports shall be further assessed as outlined in section 5.
2.4
Where further assessment of a group 1a support determines it necessary to strengthen or protect the
support, immediate action shall be taken to mitigate the risk of a weak/vulnerable support.
2.5
Group 1b supports shall be further assessed as outlined in section 5.
2.6
Where further assessment of a group 1b support determines it necessary to strengthen or protect the
support, this repair shall be undertaken as part of the next suitable major maintenance project that
allows this activity to be carried-out without significantly delaying the project or disrupting the network.
2.6.1
Where no suitable project that allows this activity to be carried out has been identified, a risk
assessment should be carried out and the supports managed in accordance with the outcome of that
risk assessment.
2.7
Where it can be demonstrated by assessment, Category 2 in accordance with CG 300 [Ref 3.N], that
collapse of one or more spans will occur following the application of the collision loading for supports in
group 1a and 1b, strengthening or protection with a very high containment barrier shall be provided.
2.8
Where collapse cannot be confirmed the structure shall be moved into group 2.
Group 2 supports
2.9
Where deemed necessary by the TAA, further structural analysis on group 2 supports shall only be
carried out when a suitable major maintenance project has been confirmed within the forward
programme.
2.9.1
Where an assessment has shown that the support requires protection, group 2 supports should be
placed in the forward programme to be protected but only as part of the next suitable major
maintenance project when the existing vehicle restraint system is planned for renewal, to minimise the
disruption to the network.
Group 3 supports
2.10
Confirmation of group 3 categorisation shall be recorded on the Overseeing Organisation's structures
management information system with supporting information.

Collision loading
3.1
The loading requirements outlined in section 3 shall be used for the assessment of group 1 and group 2
supports.
Nominal loads
3.2
The supports shall be assessed for their ability to resist both the main and residual load components
acting simultaneously in accordance with Table 3.2.
Table 3.2 Collision loads on supports of bridges over highways
Load normal to
carriageway
below (kN)
Load parallel to
carriageway

3.2.1
Where protective plinths 1.5m high are provided to footbridge supports, the plinths may be assessed
for the combined main and residual load components and the bridge supports may be assessed for the
reduced residual load component shown in Table 3.2.
3.3
The loads shall be applied horizontally as secondary live loads in combination 4 in accordance with the
requirements of CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
3.4
Loads normal to the carriageway shall be applied separately from loads parallel to the carriageway.
3.5
For all bridge elements except foundations and elastomeric bearings, the effects due to vehicle collision
shall only be applied at the ultimate limit state.
3.6
The value of partial safety factor for loading γfL shall be taken as 1.5.
3.7
Where a permissible stress approach is used to assess foundations, and where elastomeric bearings
are assessed at the serviceability limit state only, a γfL factor of 1.0, shall be used.

4. Analysis
4.
Analysis
General
4.1
The method of analysis shall be agreed with the TAA.
4.1.1
Where bridge supports are assessed, a quasi-static analysis should be carried out in the first instance.
4.1.2
Where the structure fails this assessment dynamic analysis may be used.
NOTE
The quasi-static approach can be simpler to apply than the dynamic analysis but it can yield more
conservative results.
4.1.3
For the assessment of bridge supports using the quasi-static approach, the nominal loads given in
Table 3.2 may be multiplied by a reduction factor of:
Equation 4.1.3 Reduction factor for nominal loads in Table 3.2
(
30
30 + m
)
where: m is the mass of the support member in tonnes.
NOTE
The deck loading or weight of foundation cannot be included when calculating m as this reduction is
based on momentum conservation and assumes that the support member alone participates in the
dynamic response.
4.2
Where using a quasi-static analysis for the assessment of bridge supports this reduced value of impact
loading shall be applied statically.
4.2.1
Where assessments of foundations, deck slabs and other members directly connected to the support
member are being carried out, the loads in Table 3.2 may be reduced by 50% and treated as acting
statically.
4.2.2
Where assessments of more remote members are being carried out, for example piling systems, the
loads shown in Table 3.2 may be reduced by 75% and treated as acting statically.
NOTE
It has been shown by laboratory impact tests Watson & Inkester 1982 [Ref 1.I], that a considerable
amount of the impact energy can be lost through local damage and vibration.

5. Assessment
5.
Assessment
5.1
Concrete bridge supports shall be assessed in conjunction with the requirements of CS 455 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
Vehicle collision on abutments can normally be neglected as they are assumed to have sufficient mass
to withstand the collision loads for global purposes.
5.1.1
When considering shear, flexure and bonding, the values of γmv, γmc and γmb may be reduced by 10%,
for both characteristic and worst credible strength applications CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
5.2
Steel supports shall be assessed in conjunction with the requirements of CS 456 [Ref 6.N].
5.3
Where an impact has occurred, the overall integrity of a damaged structure shall be assessed at the
ultimate limit state.
5.4
Under the primary live loading derived using combination 1 serviceability limit state γfl factors given in
Table 1 of CS 454 [Ref 1.N]; γf3 shall be taken as 1.0.
5.5
When HB loading is applied, only 30 units shall be applied.
5.6
The structure shall be assessed to see if the support system as a whole will still be capable of carrying
the imposed load from the deck above, following a collision.
5.6.1
Non-linear methods such as plastic analysis may be used for assessment.
NOTE
In many instances considerable damage can be sustained by the bridge (including large rotations,
lateral displacements and local damage) or by an individual support member (including failure of the
member, its bearings or foundations), without the structure itself failing.
5.7
Where the removal of bridge supports would not affect the overall integrity of the structure, and where it
has been checked that after impacting and removing one support, a vehicle will not damage adjacent
supports and thereby cause a collapse of the bridge deck, the supports shall not be assessed for
collision loads.
5.8
Where there are multi-level carriageways, such as those encountered in motorway, all-purpose trunk
road or principal road interchanges, the collision loads shall be assessed for each level of carriageway
separately.
5.9
Assessment shall be carried out in two stages.
Stage 1 At the moment of impact.
5.10
A check shall be made at the moment of impact at ULS only, using the nominal impact loads with partial
factors γfl appropriate to load combination 4 in accordance with 'The assessment of Highway Bridges
and Structures' CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
5.11
No other live load shall be included.
5.12
Local damage shall be ignored.
5.13
Full transfer of the collision forces from the point of impact shall be assumed.
5.14
The load-path to transfer the impact loads to foundations, bearings or other supports shall be
determined.
5.15
Each structural element in the load-path shall be assessed starting with the element which sustains the
immediate impact.
5.16
Where a structural element is determined to be inadequate it shall be assumed to have affected the
transfer to the next element(s) in the load path.
5.17
Where a structural element is determined to be inadequate it shall be neglected in carrying out the
stage 2 check.
NOTE
Inadequacy of a structural element at this stage can help to absorb the impact force.
5.18
Each element in the load-path shall be assessed on the same basis.

CS 453 Revision 0
5. Assessment
5.19
The bearing and supports shall be assessed on their ability to resist impact loads to prevent the whole
structure being bodily displaced by the impact.
NOTE
The Overseeing Organisation can require that certain other elements are adequate to resist the impact
loads.
Stage 2. Immediately after the impact
5.20
The bridge shall be checked using combination 1 in accordance to CS 454 [Ref 1.N] to ensure that it
will be able to stand up immediately after an impact whilst still carrying traffic which can be crossing.
5.21
The check shall be carried out at ULS only using the partial load factors normally appropriate to SLS.
5.21.1
The partial factors γm and γf3 should take their usual ULS values.
5.22
HA loading and/or a maximum of 30 units of HB loading shall be applied for bridges carrying public
highways.
5.23
The check shall take into account what local damage might reasonably have occurred.
5.24
The bridge support check immediately after a collision shall disregard elements that were assumed or
found to be inadequate at Stage 1.
Foundations
5.25
Foundations shall be assessed in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.N] and CS 459 [Ref 4.N].
5.26
Where checking for bearing of foundations, the ultimate bearing capacity shall be used.
5.27
Foundations shall be assessed on their ability to resist the impact forces transmitted from the collision.
5.28
The check on the foundations shall be carried out at ULS only, both for structural elements and
soil-structure interaction.
5.29
Where a check against the sliding of the base and bearing capacity is carried out, even for piled
foundations, the collision loads shall be reduced by 50%.
5.30
Where a check against overturning is carried out, the full loading shall be applied.
Group 1a and 1b supports
5.31
All assessments shall be subject to technical approval in accordance with CG 300 [Ref 3.N].
Group 2 supports
5.32
For Group 2 supports, category 0 technical approval shall apply for the assessments unless otherwise
agreed with the TAA.
5.33
For Group 2 supports, the assessments shall be limited to quantifying the capacity of the support to
resist collision loading.

6. Strengthening and protection
6.
Strengthening and protection
6.1
Group 1 and 2 supports which fail assessments shall require strengthening or additional protection so
as to be able to sustain the collision loads given in current design standards.
Strengthening
6.2
Strengthening schemes for structures which fail assessment shall be designed in accordance with
current design standards.
6.2.1
Wherever possible, strengthening should be carried out with other maintenance or improvement works
in order to minimise delays to road users.
Protection
6.3
Protection schemes for structures which fail assessment shall be designed in accordance with current
design standards.
6.3.1
Where a bridge support is protected by a vehicle restraint system the support should be assessed for
the residual load components only, unless more accurate information on the likely resulting impact
loading is available.
6.3.2
For Group 1 supports, protection may be achieved through the provision of a very high containment
level barrier (H4a) with full working width.
6.3.3
For Group 2 supports, protection may be achieved through the provision of a higher containment level
barrier (H1 or H2) with full working width.
