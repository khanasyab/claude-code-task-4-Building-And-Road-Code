Ambient noise
Ambient noise is the total sound in a given situation at a given
time usually composed of sound from many sources, near

A-weighting
In addition to its non-linear amplitude response, the human
ear has a non-linear frequency response; it is less sensitive at
low and high frequencies and most sensitive in the mid range
frequencies.
NOTE 1: The A-weighting is applied to measured sound
pressure levels so that these levels correspond more closely
to the subjective response.
NOTE 2: A-weighted noise levels are often expressed in
dB(A).
Baseline scenario
A description of the state of the environment without
implementation of the project.
Basic noise level
The basic noise level (BNL) is a measure of source noise as
defined in Appendix A.

NOTE 1: The decibel scale is logarithmic rather than linear;
the threshold of hearing is zero decibels while, at the other
extreme, the threshold of pain is about 130 decibels.
NOTE 2: These limits are seldom experienced and typical
levels lie within the range of 30 dB(A) (a quiet night time level
in a bedroom) to 90 dB(A) (at the kerbside of a busy road).

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements in this document shall be applied to the assessment, reporting and management of
environmental effects, specifically changes in noise and vibration emissions, from the delivery of
projects.
1.2
Environmental assessments shall describe the effects of changes in noise and vibration emissions in
accordance with the wider requirements and advice provided in:
1) LA 101 [Ref 14.N] Introduction to environmental assessment;
2) LA 102 [Ref 19.N] Screening projects for Environmental Impact Assessment;
3) LA 103 [Ref 18.N] Scoping projects for environmental assessment; and
4) LA 104 [Ref 12.N] Environmental assessment and monitoring
1.3
The environmental assessment must, in line with the 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N] describe the likely significant
effects of proposed projects on the environment resulting from the emissions of noise and vibration.
1.4
Environmental assessment of noise and vibration emissions shall include likely significant effects from:
1) construction noise;
2) construction vibration; and
3) operational noise.
NOTE
Operational vibration is scoped out of the assessment methodology as a maintained road surface will
be free of irregularities as part of project design and under general maintenance, so operational
vibration will not have the potential to lead to significant adverse effects.
1.5
The assessment of noise and vibration shall inform the assessment of other environmental factors,
where appropriate.
Implementation
1.6
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all projects involving construction, improvement and
maintenance of motorways and all purpose trunk roads on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 15.N].
Use of GG 101
1.7
The requirements contained in GG 101 [ GG 101 [Ref 15.N] shall be followed in respect of activities
covered by this document.

2. Principles and purpose
2.
Principles and purpose
2.1
During options identification, the level of detail of a noise and vibration assessment shall be
proportionate to the quality of data available and the risk of likely significant effects occurring.
NOTE
Scoping assessments can identify and focus the assessment on the risk of likely significant
environmental effects occurring for route options.
2.2
The assessment shall determine and report likely significant effects on sensitive buildings within the
relevant study areas.
2.2.1
For cultural heritage resources, the impact of noise and or vibration on the people living in buildings
should be included within the noise and vibration assessment.
2.3
The assessment of whether noise and/or vibration levels generated by the project gives rise to, or
contributes to, a likely significant effect shall be undertaken and reported within the following
documents:
1) LA 108 [Ref 2.N] for receptors containing biodiversity resources;
2) LA 107 [Ref 16.N] for receptors containing landscape resources;
3) LA 106 [Ref 8.N] for receptors containing cultural heritage resources;
4) LA 112 [Ref 17.N] for receptors containing community recreational facilities.
2.3.1
For cultural heritage resources the impact of noise and vibration on the building itself, or its setting,
should be included within the cultural heritage assessment - see LA 106 [Ref 8.N].
Baseline scenario
2.4
The baseline scenario shall be defined and described in accordance with LA 104 [Ref 12.N].
2.5
The assessment shall predict:
1) construction noise levels and comparison with the baseline at noise sensitive receptors within the
construction noise study area;
2) construction vibration levels and comparison with the baseline at vibration sensitive receptors within
the construction vibration study area;
3) operational noise levels and changes from the baseline at noise sensitive receptors within the
operational noise study area.

Assessment methodology
Construction noise assessment
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall report on the following questions to gain an understanding of the need to
undertake further assessment:
1) does construction noise generated by the project have the potential to adversely affect any noise
sensitive receptors?;
2) are there any noise receptors where there would be a reasonable stakeholder expectation that a
construction noise assessment would be undertaken?
NOTE
An example of reasonable stakeholder expectation that a construction noise assessment would be
required is where works are not noisy enough to give rise to adverse effects at the noise sensitive
receptors, but will be visible from the receptor and/or last for many weeks.
3.2
Scoping assessments shall be based on existing available information.
3.3
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
3.4
The scoping assessment shall follow the process illustrated in Figure 3.4N.
NOTE
The flow diagram in Figure 3.4N illustrates the scoping process for construction noise.

LA 111 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
Study areas
3.5
A construction noise study area shall be defined, where the need for further assessment has been
established to include all noise sensitive receptors:
1) that are potentially affected by construction noise;
2) in areas where there is a reasonable stakeholder expectation that a construction noise assessment
will be undertaken.
NOTE 1
A study area of 300m from the closest construction activity is normally sufficient to encompass noise
sensitive receptors.
NOTE 2
Variations in the study area can be defined for individual projects.
3.6
A diversion route study area shall be defined where a project requires full carriageway closures during
the night (23:00-07:00) to enable construction works to take place.
3.7
A diversion route study area shall be defined to include a 25m width from the kerb line of the diversion
route.
NOTE 1
When full carriageway closures are implemented at night on major roads, traffic using those roads is
diverted onto local roads that normally experience lower traffic levels at night.
NOTE 2
The sudden change of traffic levels on diversion routes, as a result of night time closures, is highly likely
to cause disturbance to receptors next to (within 25m of) the road.
NOTE 3
It is possible to calculate changes in noise levels due to diversion routes, but it is not a proportionate
approach, as it would require significant work in additional traffic modelling and noise calculations that
would be highly likely to confirm that disturbance would occur.
3.8
A construction traffic study area shall be defined to include a 50m width from the kerb line of public
roads with the potential for a increase in baseline noise level (BNL) of 1 dB(A) or more as a result of the
addition of construction traffic to existing traffic levels.
Baseline
3.9
Construction noise baseline shall be determined via one or more of the following methods:
1) noise measurements, based upon actual survey data;
2) predicted noise levels (noise model outputs);
3) existing noise mapping undertaken by public bodies or as part of other developments.
3.10
The scope of the assessment of the extent and quality of data required to determine the baseline noise
environment shall be proportionate and include:
1) the risk of a likely significant effect occurring;
2) the stage of development of the project;
3) the availability of previously collected data.
3.10.1
Noise monitoring, specifically for the purposes of construction noise baseline data collection, should
only be undertaken where data from other sources is not sufficient to enable production of a
proportionate construction noise assessment.
NOTE
Additional methodology on predicting construction noise can be found in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N].
Determining significance
3.11
Lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) and significant observable adverse effect level
(SOAEL) shall be established and reported within the environmental assessment for all noise sensitive
receptors within the construction activity study area, with reference to baseline noise levels.

from standards to the Overseeing Organisation for approval.
3.13
Construction noise levels shall be calculated at selected locations which are representative of all noise
sensitive receptors in the study area.
3.13.1
Calculations may be undertaken at a selection of noise sensitive receptors, or at varying distances from
each activity, to represent all receptors in the study area.
3.14
The calculation of construction noise levels shall follow the methodology in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N] and
include the following sources where they are present:
1) construction plant in use on the project;
2) construction compounds;
3) traffic on haul roads not part of the public highway;
3.15
Construction traffic BNL increases shall be calculated for roads within the construction traffic study area.

3.18
For diversion routes used at night, a major magnitude of impact for construction noise impact shall be
determined at any noise sensitive receptors within the diversion route study area.
3.19
Construction noise and construction traffic noise shall constitute a significant effect where it is
determined that a major or moderate magnitude of impact will occur for a duration exceeding:
1) 10 or more days or nights in any 15 consecutive days or nights;
2) a total number of days exceeding 40 in any 6 consecutive months.
NOTE 1
It is more appropriate to use the specified timescales for highway construction, which are taken from
BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N] section E.4, rather than the '1 month or more' timescale included within E.3.3 of
BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N] due to the transient nature of most highway construction work.
NOTE 2
Where specific local circumstances mean that an alternative method for determining significance is
more appropriate, the alternative method can be submitted as a departure from standards to the
Overseeing Organisation for approval.
3.20
The following shall be reported in the environmental assessment:
1) data sources used;
2) assumptions applied during use of data;
3) the risk of any inaccuracies or errors within the data, or any modifications or assumptions made,
leading to the assessment drawing incorrect conclusion;.
4) locations of noise sources and noise sensitive receptors.
NOTE
Instruction on allowing for uncertainty in Environmental Impact Assessment is provided in LA 104 [Ref
12.N].
Design and mitigation
3.21
Two types of construction noise mitigation shall be incorporated into the design of the construction of
the project as follows:
1) best practice noise mitigation techniques to minimise the generation and impact of noise applied to
all construction activities;
2) specific noise mitigation measures to reduce the noise impact from activities which result in
moderate or major magnitude of effect.
3.21.1
Best practice noise mitigation techniques should include the following measures:
1) training of site personnel to raise awareness of noise and nearby noise sensitive receptors;
2) provision of information to the public on expected construction noise, including duration, especially
to those likely to be exposed to moderate and major magnitude of effect.
NOTE
Examples of best practice construction noise techniques are presented in the following references:
1) best practicable means as defined in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N];
2) guidance presented in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N];

3) information within industry specific schemes such as: Considerate Constructors Scheme Best
Practice Hub Considerate Contractor (Website) [Ref 1.I].
3.22
The implications of the use of specific mitigation measures on cost and construction timescales shall be
determined and reported to the Overseeing Organisation.
3.22.1
Specific noise mitigation measures for sources other than diversion routes may include:
1) specification of the use of noise reduction construction methods, for example: specifying the use of
rotary rather than driven piling;
2) provision of measures to reduce the noise reaching noise sensitive receptors, for example:
installation of temporary barriers;
3) restriction of some activities to less sensitive times, for example: restricting piling activity to the
daytime only;
4) providing noise insulation to houses, or temporarily rehousing local residents.
3.22.2
Specific noise mitigation measures for diversion routes may include:
1) use of more than one diversion route for different closures, to reduce the exposure of individual
noise sensitive receptors;
2) providing noise insulation to residents along the diversion routes.
3.23
Specific noise mitigation measures shall only be included within the project if they are practicable as
defined in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
Advice relating to the practicability of specific mitigation measures can be sought from project sponsors
and or those responsible for determining the construction methodology for the project.
3.24
Where a specific noise mitigation measure is not practicable, as defined in BS 5228-1 [Ref 5.N], the
measure shall not be included within the project design for the purposes of the construction noise
assessment.
3.25
Specific noise mitigation measures included within the project shall be listed in the assessment and
included within the construction stage of the environment management plan for the project.
Construction vibration assessment
Scoping
3.26
The scoping assessment shall report on the following scoping assessment questions to gain an
understanding of the need to undertake further assessment:
1) does vibration from construction have the potential to adversely affect any vibration sensitive
receptors?;
2) does the scale of the development or type of construction mean that there will be a reasonable
stakeholder expectation that a construction vibration assessment would be undertaken at any
vibration sensitive receptors?
NOTE
An example of reasonable stakeholder expectation that a construction vibration assessment would be
required is where works are unlikely to generate enough vibration to give rise to adverse effects at the
vibration sensitive receptors, but be visible and/or audible from the receptor and/or last for many weeks.
3.27
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', the scoping
assessment shall make a recommendation on the scope of further assessment.
3.28
Scoping assessments shall be based on reasonably available information.
NOTE
The flow diagram in Figure 3.28N illustrates the scoping process for construction vibration.

3. Assessment methodology
Study area
3.29
Where the need for further assessment has been established, a vibration study area shall be defined to
include all:
1) vibration sensitive receptors that are potentially affected by construction vibration;
2) vibration sensitive receptors in areas where there is a reasonable stakeholder expectation that a
construction vibration assessment will be undertaken.
NOTE 1
A study area of 100m from the closest construction activity with the potential to generate vibration is
normally sufficient to encompass vibration sensitive receptors.
NOTE 2
Variations in the study area can be defined for individual projects.
Baseline
3.30
The construction vibration baseline shall be assumed to be zero due to the absence of construction
work prior to project commencement.
Determining significance
3.31
Where the need for further assessment has been established, the LOAEL and SOAEL for construction
vibration shall be set as follows:
Table 3.31 Construction vibration LOAELs and SOAELs for all receptors
Time period
LOAEL
SOAEL
All time periods
0.3mm/s PPV
1.0mm/s PPV
NOTE
Where specific local circumstances mean that an alternative method of setting LOAEL and SOAEL for
vibration sensitive receptors is more appropriate,the alternative method can be submitted as a
departure from standards to the Overseeing Organisation for approval.
3.32
Where the need for further assessment has been established, the prediction methodology presented in
BS 5228-2 [Ref 6.N] shall be used to to calculate construction vibration levels for all activities with the
potential to adversely affect vibration sensitive receptors.
3.33
Magnitude of impact shall be determined in accordance with Table 3.33:
Table 3.33 Vibration level - magnitude of impact
Magnitude
Vibration level
Major
Above or equal to 10 mm/s PPV
Moderate
Above or equal to SOAEL and below 10 mm/s PPV
Minor

3.34
Construction vibration shall constitute a likely significant effect where it is determined that a major or
moderate magnitude of impact will occur for a duration exceeding:
1) 10 or more days or nights in any 15 consecutive days or nights; or
2) a total number of days exceeding 40 in any 6 consecutive months.
NOTE
The duration timescales are used to retain consistency with those used in the construction noise
assessment.
3.35
The following shall be reported in the environmental assessment:
1) data sources used;

4) the risk of any inaccuracies or errors within the data, or any modifications or assumptions made,
leading to the assessment drawing incorrect conclusions;
5) locations of vibration sources and vibration sensitive receptors;
6) the risk of structural damage due to construction vibration, with reference to criteria set out in BS

NOTE 1
Instruction on allowing for uncertainty in Environmental Impact Assessment is provided in LA 104 [Ref
12.N].
NOTE 2
Human response to vibration occurs at much lower vibration levels than would be required to cause
damage to buildings.
Design and mitigation
3.36
Two types of construction vibration mitigation shall be incorporated into the design of the construction
of the project as follows:
1) best practice vibration mitigation techniques to minimise the generation and impact of vibration
applied to all construction activities;
2) specific vibration mitigation measures to reduce the vibration impact from activities which result in
major or moderate impacts.
3.36.1
Best practice should include the following measures:
1) selection of construction method and plant to minimise vibration generated;
2) training of site personnel to raise awareness of vibration and nearby vibration sensitive receptors;
3) provision of information to the public on expected construction vibration, including duration,
especially to those likely to be exposed to moderate and major impacts.
NOTE
Examples of best practice construction vibration techniques are presented in the following references:
1) best practicable means as defined in BS 5228-2 [Ref 6.N];
2) guidance presented in BS 5228-2 [Ref 6.N];
3) information within industry specific schemes such as Considerate Constructors Scheme Best
Practice Hub Considerate Contractor (Website) [Ref 1.I].
3.37
The implications of the use of specific mitigation measures on cost and construction timescales shall be
determined and provided to the Overseeing Organisation.
3.37.1
Specific vibration mitigation measures may include:
1) restrictions on construction method to reduce vibration;
2) restrictions of some activities to less sensitive times, for example, restricting piling activity to the
daytime only;
3) temporarily rehousing local residents.
3.38
Specific vibration mitigation measures shall only be included within the project if they are practicable as
defined in BS 5228-2 [Ref 6.N].
3.39
Where a specific mitigation measure is not practicable as defined in BS 5228-2 [Ref 6.N], the measure
shall not be included within the project design for the purposes of the construction vibration
assessment.
NOTE
Advice relating to the practicality of specific mitigation measures can be sought from project sponsors
and or those responsible for determining the construction methodology for the project.

LA 111 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
3.40
Specific vibration mitigation measures shall be listed in the assessment and included within the
construction part of the environmental management plan (EMP) for the project.
Operational noise assessment
Scoping
3.41
The scoping assessment shall report on the following scoping assessment questions to gain an
understanding of the need to undertake a further noise assessment:
1) is the project likely to cause a change in the BNL of 1dB LA10,18hr in the do-minimum opening year
(DMOY) compared to the do-something opening year (DSOY)?;
2) is the project likely to cause a change in the BNL of 3dB LA10,18hr in the do-something future year
(DSFY) compared to the DMOY?;
3) does the project involve the construction of new road links within 600m of noise sensitive receptors?;
4) would there be a reasonable stakeholder expectation that an assessment would be undertaken?
NOTE
An example of reasonable stakeholder expectation that an operational noise assessment would be
required is where works involve changes to infrastructure but are not expected to give rise to significant
environment effect, such as smart motorway projects.
3.42
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', the scoping
assessment shall make a recommendation on the scope of further assessment.
3.43
Scoping assessments shall be based on available information.
Study area
3.44
Where the need for further assessment has been established, an operational study area shall be
defined within the scoping assessment to include:
1) noise sensitive receptors that are potentially affected by operational noise changes generated by the
project, either on the route of the project or other roads not physically changed by the project;
2) noise sensitive receptors in areas where there is a reasonable stakeholder expectation that noise
assessment is undertaken.
NOTE 1
An operational study area defined as the following can be sufficient for most projects, but it can be
reduced or extended to ensure it is proportionate to the risk of likely significant effects:
1) the area within 600m of new road links or road links physically changed or bypassed by the project;
2) the area within 50m of other road links with potential to experience a short term BNL change of more
than 1.0dB(A) as a result of the project.
NOTE 2
Variations in the study area can be defined for individual projects.
Baseline
3.45
The operational noise baseline shall be determined from do-minimum noise levels in each assessment
year.
3.45.1
Noise monitoring should be used to inform baseline noise modelling results and to provide data for
public consultation purposes.
NOTE
Validation of baseline can be undertaken by comparing modelled noise levels to measured noise
levels, using corrections to take account of expected changes in traffic levels between the date of
monitoring and the date of the baseline.
3.46
Where noise monitoring is undertaken, it shall follow the procedures set out in BS 7445-1 [Ref 9.N].
3.47
Noise monitoring data shall only be valid when it is undertaken during periods when:
1) wind speed is less than 5m/s;

2) there is no precipitation and road surfaces are dry.
3.48
Noise equipment used for monitoring shall be class 1 following the specification in IEC 61672 [Ref
11.N].
Determining significance
3.49
LOAELs and SOAELs shall be set for all noise sensitive receptors within the study area, for time
periods when they are in use.
NOTE
For example, schools are typically not in use at night when they are closed, so only daytime LOAELs
and SOAELs are required to be set for typical schools.
3.49.1
LOAELs and SOAELs should be set out in accordance with Table 3.49.1 for all noise sensitive
receptors:
Table 3.49.1 Operational noise LOAELs and SOAELs for all receptors
Time Period
LOAEL
SOAEL
Day (06:00-24:00)

Night (23:00-07:00)
40dB Lnight, outside (free-field)
55dB Lnight, outside (free-field)
3.50
LOAELs and SOAELs shall be modified where it is proportionate and merited by local circumstances
which can include, but are not limited to:
1) noise sensitive receptors that have reduced sensitivity to noise or vibration e.g., sensitivity to noise
is reduced if receptors have good noise insulation;
2) noise sensitive receptors that have an increased sensitivity to noise or vibration e.g., if a building is
regularly used by people with hearing impairments, it is likely to be more sensitive to the users, as
noise affects speech intelligibility at lower levels than it would for those with non-impaired hearing.
NOTE 1
Modification can be proportionate where it has the potential to change the assessment of likely
significant effects.
NOTE 2
Examples of receptors with good noise insulation can include properties that have been included within
Highway Authority insulation schemes, or newer properties that have noise insulation to reduce road
noise incorporated into their design (evidence to support the latter can be found in planning application
documents for developments).
3.51
Noise change due to the project shall be determined at noise sensitive receptors within the study area,
during the periods for which LOAELs and SOAELs have been set, for:
1) Short term: DMOY compared against the DSOY;
2) Long-term: DMOY compared against the DSFY;
3) Non-project noise change: do-minimum future year (DMFY) compared against the DMOY.
3.51.1
Noise level changes may be determined through:
1) calculation of noise levels at each individual noise sensitive receptor; or
2) calculation of noise levels at a sample of noise sensitive receptors representative of all noise
sensitive receptors.
3.51.2
Noise level changes may be determined by:
1) comparing noise levels calculated at noise sensitive receptors using CRTN [Ref 3.N] calculations as
modified by Appendix A;
2) Comparing of BNL change of road links using the methodology in Appendix A.
NOTE 1
CRTN [Ref 3.N] calculations of noise levels change at noise sensitive receptors are likely to be required
within 600m of new road links or roads physically changed by the project.

======================================================================
LA 111 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
NOTE 2
Calculations of BNL change are likely to be required for noise sensitive receptors not covered by
calculations of noise level change, and within 50m of road links where noise levels change by 1dB(A) in
the short term or 3dB(A) in the long term.
NOTE 3
Where BNL changes show likely significant effects for noise sensitive receptors along road links, it can
be appropriate to extend CRTN [Ref 3.N] calculations to include these road links.
3.52
Traffic data used for noise calculations shall be subject to the speed pivoting process set out in
Appendix A.
NOTE
The speed pivoting process is normally undertaken by traffic engineers who are responsible for
preparing traffic models for road projects.
3.53
Where the noise sensitive receptor is a building, the facade used to calculate noise change shall be
chosen as follows:
1) the facade with the greatest magnitude of noise change;
2) where the greatest magnitude of noise change is equal on more than one facade, the facade
experiencing the greatest magnitude of noise change and highest do-something noise level.
NOTE
The greatest magnitude of change is likely to occur on the facade facing the new or changed stretch of
road, or facades facing road links leading directly to major junctions, but this is not always the case,
particularly at buildings close to junctions.
3.54
The magnitude of change shall be defined in accordance with Table 3.54a for short term and Table
3.54b for long term:

3. Assessment methodology
3.57
It shall be determined whether the operational noise changes constitute a likely significant effect on
noise sensitive buildings as defined by the 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
3.58
The initial assessment of likely significant effect on noise sensitive buildings shall be determined using
Table 3.58.
Table 3.58 Initial assessment of operational noise significance
Significance
Short term magnitude of change
Significant
Major
Significant
Moderate
Not significant
Minor
Not significant
Negligible
3.59
Where the magnitude of change in the short term is negligible at noise sensitive buildings, it shall be
concluded that the noise change will not cause changes to behaviour or response to noise and as
such, will not give rise to a likely significant effect.
3.60
For noise sensitive receptors where the magnitude of change in the short term is minor, moderate or
major at noise sensitive buildings, Table 3.60 shall be used, together with the output of Table 3.58 to
determine final significance.
Table 3.60 Determining final operational significance on noise sensitive buildngs
Local circumstance
Influence on significance judgement
Noise level change (is the magnitude of change
close to the minor/moderate boundary?)
1) Noise level changes within 1 dB of the top of
the 'minor' range can indicate that it is more
appropriate to determine a likely significant
effect. Noise level changes within 1 dB of the
bottom of a 'moderate' range can indicate
that it is more appropriate to consider a
change is not a likely significant effect.

1) Where the long term impact is predicted to be
greater than the short term impact, it can be
appropriate to conclude that a minor change
in the short term is a likely significant effect.
Where the long term impact is predicted to be
less than the short term it can be appropriate
to conclude that a moderate or major change
in the short term is not significant.
2) A similar change in the long term and
non-project noise change can indicate that
the change is not due to the project and not
an indication of a likely significant effect.

3. Assessment methodology
Table 3.60 Determining final operational significance on noise sensitive buildngs (continued)
Local circumstance
Influence on significance judgement
Absolute noise level with reference to LOAEL
and SOAEL (by design this includes sensitivity of
receptor)
1) A noise change where all do-something
absolute noise levels are below SOAEL
requires no modification of the initial
assessment.
2) Where any do-something absolute noise
levels are above the SOAEL, a noise change
in the short term of 1.0dB or over results in a
likely significant effect.
Location of noise sensitive parts of a receptor
1) If the sensitive parts of a receptor are
protected from the noise source, it can be
appropriate to conclude a moderate or major
magnitude change in the short term and/or
long term is not a likely significant effect.
2) Conversely, if the sensitive parts of the
receptor are exposed to the noise source, it
can be more appropriate to conclude a minor
change in the short term and/or long term is a
likely significant effect.
3) It is only necessary to look in detail at
individual receptors in terms of this
circumstance where the decision on whether
the noise change gives rise to a significant
environmental effect is marginal.
Acoustic context
1) If a project changes the acoustic character of
an area, it can be appropriate to conclude a
minor magnitude of change in the short term
and/or long term is a likely significant effect.
Likely perception of change by residents
1) If the project results in obvious changes to the
landscape or setting of a receptor, it is likely
that noise level changes will be more acutely
perceived by the noise sensitive receptors. In
these cases it can be appropriate to conclude
that a minor change in the short term and/or
long term is a likely significant effect.
2) Conversely, if the project results in no
obvious changes for the landscape,
particularly if the road is not visible from the
receptor, it can be appropriate to conclude
that a moderate change in the short term
and/or long term is not a likely significant
effect.
NOTE 1
In relation to the location of sensitive parts of the receptor, an example of a situation where sensitive
parts of a receptor would be protected from the noise source would include a house with no, or very

few, windows of sensitive rooms facing the road, and its outdoor spaces are protected from the road by
buildings.
NOTE 2
In relation to the location of sensitive parts of the receptor, an example of a situation where sensitive
parts of a receptor would be exposed to the noise source would include a house with most windows of
sensitive rooms facing the road, and/or outdoor spaces facing the road.
3.61
The number of properties affected shall not be used to justify change between the initial operational
significance and the final operational significance.
3.62
The following shall be reported in the assessment:
1) data sources used;
2) assumptions applied during use of data;
3) the risk of any inaccuracies or errors within the data, or any modifications or assumptions made,
leading to the assessment drawing incorrect conclusions; and
4) locations of noise sources and noise sensitive receptors.
3.63
The assessment report shall include justification for determination of significance for each noise
sensitive receptor in the study area.
3.63.1
Presentation of the conclusions to determine likely significant effects on noise sensitive receptors
should:
1) be succinct;
2) be grouped to aid presentation; and,
3) present clear justification if likely significant effect exists.
NOTE
There are many options for grouping noise sensitive receptors to aid presentation, these can include
location, setting, similarity of noise change or other criteria.
Operational noise management
3.64
Any mitigation measure that has the potential to mitigate or manage existing operational noise, and/or
operational noise generated by a project, within a project area, shall be identified and reported within
the assessment.
3.64.1
Measures to mitigate and manage operational noise may include, but are not limited to:
1) vertical or horizontal alignment of the road;
2) earth bunds to act as a noise barrier;
3) noise barriers;
4) low noise road surfacing;
5) speed limits;
6) restrictions on noisy vehicle types.
NOTE
Speed limits or restrictions on noisy vehicle types are not normally practical for use on motorways and
all purpose trunk roads, as they can encourage drivers to take alternative routes, which can be less
safe and result in higher noise levels for populations along the alternative routes.
3.65
The suitability of each potential mitigation measure for use within the project area shall be determined
based on the following criteria:
1) for residential noise receptors only, a comparison of the monetised noise benefit of a mitigation
measure against the cost of the measure over the anticipated design life of the project;
2) the likely perceived benefit of the measure at any noise sensitive receptors;
3) the benefit of a measure in terms of elimination of likely significant effects;

3. Assessment methodology
4) practicality of the measure, for example, in terms of safety considerations and engineering
constraints;
5) the impact of the measure across other environmental factors, for example the visual impact of a
noise barrier.
NOTE
Information received at project consultation events can help to determine the likely perceived benefit of
a potential mitigation measure.
3.65.1
The cost of mitigation measures should be determined with reference to previously installed similar
measures, and include costs of installation and maintenance through its life.
3.65.2
Where the life of a mitigation measure is shorter than the assessment period, costs for replacement at
the relevant intervals should be included.
3.65.3
Detailed analysis of all of the criteria should only be undertaken where it is considered that that a
mitigation measure has the potential to be suitable based on all of the criteria.
NOTE
For example, where it was determined at the outset that a barrier would not be practical as there was
insufficient space, there would be no requirement to undertake detailed analysis on other criteria such
as value for money.
3.66
Mitigation measures that are deemed suitable for use shall be included within the project design.
3.67
The insertion loss for each noise barrier included within the project shall be reported.
3.68
Individual noise barriers included within the project shall be designated as either:
1) reflective, where there is no potential for increased noise levels at any noise sensitive receptors due
to reflections of noise from the road facing surfaces of the barrier; or
2) absorptive, where there is potential for increased noise levels at any noise sensitive receptors due to
reflections of noise from the road facing surfaces of the barrier.
3.69
Where barriers included within the project are required to be absorptive, each of the absorptive barriers
shall be designated as either:
1) a single barrier, where there are barriers on one side of the road; or
2) a parallel barrier, where there are barriers on both sides of the road.

Monitoring and evaluation
Construction
4.1
Likely significant environmental effects from noise and/or vibration during construction shall be
monitored.
4.1.1
Monitoring of likely significant effects should include one or more of the following:
1) verification that specific noise and vibration mitigation measures are in place for activities where
there is potential for likely significant effects to occur in their absence;
2) measurement of noise and/or vibration;
3) checking that noise and vibration management procedures and practices are sufficient to ensure
that adverse effects are no worse than set out in the assessment report.
Operation phase
4.2
Likely significant environmental effects from noise during operation shall be monitored and include:
1) ensuring mitigation measures included with the project design are incorporated with the as-built
project. Where they are not included, ensuring resultant noise levels, taking account of any
additional mitigation installed but not included in the assessed design, are no higher than set out in
the project assessment;
2) ensuring specifications of noise mitigation measures, including barriers and low noise surfaces,
meet design specifications.
NOTE
Post construction noise monitoring cannot provide a reliable gauge for whether the predicted
magnitude and extent of operational adverse impacts are greater or less than those predicted in the
assessment, this is due to the following reasons:
1) the assessment is based on annual average conditions with and without the project to ensure a
like-for-like comparison, which is not possible to replicate through monitoring within a reasonable
timescales;
2) monitoring in the absence of the project would need to be completed before the start of the
construction works, and would therefore be a number of years before the with-scheme monitoring
and the assessment completed for the environmental statement is based on calculated road traffic
noise levels, whereas ambient noise monitoring can be affected by other noise sources such as
people, agricultural activities, military activities, aircraft etc.

Appendix A. Operation noise calculations
Appendix A. Operation noise calculations
A1
BNL Calculations
BNL calculations are undertaken by using traffic flow, speed and HGV percentage to calculate a
reference noise emission from the road link, as set out in CRTN [Ref 3.N].
A2
CRTN Modifications
Modifications to CRTN [Ref 3.N] methodology are listed as follows:
1) adopt dual source lines for all dual carriageways;
2) include reflection and screening of barriers located in the central reservation within the noise model
if they equal to or more than 1.5m in height;
3) classify all vehicles with an unladen weight of less than 3.5 tonnes as light vehicles, and all vehicles
with an unladen weight of greater than 3.5 tonnes as heavy vehicles;
4) use pivoted speeds, as defined below, for road links within the noise model.
5) for thin surfacing with speeds of greater than 75km/h, adopt a surface correction of the RSI, or if RSI
data is not available assume an upper limit correction of -3.5dB;
6) Where speed changes from below or equal to 75km/h to above 75km/h (or vice versa) do not occur:
a) for hot rolled asphalt surfaces, a correction of -0.5dB should be used for speeds greater than
75km/h;
b) for brushed concrete surfacing, with speeds greater than 75km/h adopt a surface correction of:
+3.5dB;
c) for all roads with speeds of less than or equal to 75 km/h, adopt a surface correction of -1.0 dB
for all surfaces;
7) Where speed changes from below or equal to 75km/h to above 75km/h (or vice versa) do occur:
a) where the speed change is less than 15 km/h, adopt surface correction set out in modification 8
based on the DM speed in both scenarios;
b) where the speed change is more than 15km/h, adopt the surface correction set out in
modification 8 based on the speed for each scenario;
8) for roads with mixed surfaces, apply the surface correction applicable to the surface type covering
the largest proportion of the road, or if two surface types cover equal proportions of the road, apply
the surface correction that results in the highest magnitude of change;
9) use the equations set out in Charts 7 and 8 of CRTN [Ref 3.N] to calculate noise to a distance of
600m TRL PR/SE/611/99 [Ref 4.N] from the road. Assume distance attenuation of 3dB per doubling
of distance for distances in excess of 600m;
10) where purpose built noise barriers are classed as absorptive, a reflection correction is not needed;
11) apply correction for reflection effects from opposite facades when the horizontal distance between
the calculation point and the nearside kerb (d) and the horizontal distance between the source line
and the opposite facade (D) meet either of the following conditions, with reference to the limits of
application set out in CRTN paragraph 26.2:
a) d < 12m and D <= 20m;
b) 12m<d<=300m and D<=10(0.825+0.4log(d+3.5)).
Best available information should be used to determine where existing barriers are absorptive or
reflective for the purposes of CRTN calculations.
TRL research TRL PR/SE/451/02 [Ref 7.N] provides methods to convert LA10,18hr to other indices.
'Method 1' requires hourly traffic flows but gives reliable results. TRL 'Method 2' has been shown in
some circumstances to give large step changes and thus unreliable results.
TRL 'Method 3' provides reliable results for most UK roads. Exceptions to this can include roads where
the proportion of night time traffic to day time traffic is atypical, which can occur on roads serving
facilities that operate 24 hours per day, for example airports or ports.

Appendix A. Operation noise calculations
If TRL Method 3 is used with do-something traffic data on congestion relief projects, it has the potential
to over predict increases in night-time traffic.
A3
Speed pivoting process
Speed pivoting ensures that modelled speeds from the the traffic model are consistent with observed
speeds. The process can be applicable to all roads within the operational noise study area, and is
implemented by the project's traffic modelling team.
The implementation of speed pivoting process should be proportionate to the stage of the assessment,
e.g. it is not necessary to undertake the full speed pivoting process at early stages of a scheme,
particularly where the traffic models are likely to be updated.
The speed pivoting process is set out as follows:
1) observed vehicle speeds at a link level are obtained for the traffic model base year from data sets
such as TrafficMaster, GPS, mobile phone data, etc;
2) the observed speed is divided by the modelled speeds for the time period(s) considered by the noise
assessment, to generate the speed pivot factor.
3) modelled link speeds in each assessment scenario are multiplied by the speed pivot factor;
4) apply pivot factor.
Where observed speeds are not available for individual links and/or particular time periods, the speed
pivot factor can be estimated using the following information: the speed pivoting performance on
adjacent links, the speed pivoting performance on roads with similar characteristics either in the local
area or across the study area e.g. motorways, urban centre roads, single carriageways, rural roads.

NN-NPS Aim
Action
Action applicable to all three aims
Aim 1: Avoid significant adverse impacts on health
and quality of life from noise as a result of the new
development.
NOTE: Significant adverse noise effects occur
when noise levels are above SOAEL.
1) For each receptor or group of receptors, set
out the mitigation measures used to reduce
noise exposure to below SOAEL;
2) Where project noise levels are not predicted to
be below the SOAEL, report the reasons why
noise levels could not be reduced below the
SOAEL, in terms of Government policy on
sustainable development.
Aim 2: Mitigate and minimise other adverse
impacts on health and quality of life from noise
from the new development.
NOTE: Other adverse impacts occur when noise
levels are between LOAEL and SOAEL.
1) Set out measures used to mitigate and
minimise other adverse impacts for all
receptors or groups of receptors where project
noise levels are above LOAEL;
2) Where project noise levels are not predicted to
be below the LOAEL, report the reasons why
noise levels could not be reduced below the
LOAEL, in terms of Government policy on
sustainable development.
Aim 3: Contribute to improvements to health and
quality of life through the effective management
and control of noise, where possible.

E/2.
Noise Insulation Regulations
E/2.1
The environmental assessment shall report on the properties which are forecast to be eligible for
insulation under the Noise Insulation Regulations [Ref 5.N].
E/2.1.1
An assessment of indicative forecast eligibility may be undertaken at options identification stage where
routes pass through urban areas.
NOTE
The assessment of indicative forecast eligibility sets out which buildings are forecast to be eligible for
either statutory or discretionary noise insulation, and in urban areas it can be appropriate to complete
this at an early project stage to estimate costs of insulation, if there is potential for it to be required for
large numbers of dwellings.
