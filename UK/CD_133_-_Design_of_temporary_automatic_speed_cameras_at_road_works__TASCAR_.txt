CD 133 Version 1.0.0
2. General requirements for TASCAR
2.
General requirements for TASCAR
Principles to be applied to the design of TASCAR
2.1
TASCAR shall be designed:
1)
on a scheme-specific basis;
2)
to detect speeding offences 24 hours per day, 7 days per week during the required period of
operation;
3)
to allow each enforcement authority (EA) to retrieve and process evidence of speeding offences
using instation facilities in each EA's office;
4)
so that all TASCAR equipment is secured to prevent unauthorised access and tampering; and,
5)
to facilitate construction of the designed scheme and the temporary traffic management (TTM)
arrangements associated with the scheme.
2.1.1
TASCAR should be designed so that the installation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning
of TASCAR have minimal impact on the works to implement the designed scheme.
2.1.2
The positioning of TASCAR installations may need to change during the scheme works to account for,
for example, scheme phasing, changes in the length of carriageway subject to speed control measures,
or changes in the speed limit to be enforced.
2.2
Safe systems of work, including safety risk assessment, design review, and design approval, shall be
developed and followed throughout the design of TASCAR.
DMRB, MCHW and other documents applicable to the design of TASCAR
2.3
This document shall be read in conjunction with:
1)
CC 133 [Ref 1.N] (Construction of TASCAR);
2)
CD 130 [Ref 3.N] (Design and specification requirements for temporary traffic management at
road works and temporary layouts); and
3)
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 13.N] (Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 - Traffic safety measures and signs for
road works and temporary situations).

CD 133 Version 1.0.0
3. Detailed design requirements for TASCAR
Siting of TASCAR equipment
3.7
Where TASCAR equipment is to be installed on the road, it shall be sited:
1)
within the highway boundary;
2)
to allow HOTA-compliant operation; and
3)
to allow safe access for fault rectification, routine maintenance and wholesale replacement.
3.7.1
Where an average speed TASCAR system is to be installed, the length of the scheme area covered by
the TASCAR system should be maximised.
NOTE
The road safety benefits of an average speed TASCAR system can be maximised by placing TASCAR
equipment as close as possible to the beginnings and ends of speed control zones, although TSM
Chapter 8 [Ref 13.N]advises that entry sites to average speed control zones are not located between
the initial terminal speed limit signing and the first repeater sign.
3.8
Where TASCAR equipment is to be installed in an EA's office, the positioning of equipment and the
source(s) of electricity shall be agreed with the EA.
Temporary traffic signs and road markings for TASCAR
3.9
CD 130 [Ref 3.N] shall be used for the design of temporary traffic signs for TASCAR.
3.10
Temporary traffic signs for TASCAR shall include speed limit signs, speed camera signs and repeater
signs in accordance with the applicable traffic signs regulations.
3.10.1
Where an average speed TASCAR system is to be installed, the 'average speed check' variant of the
speed camera sign should be used.
3.11
A repeater sign, incorporating a speed limit repeater sign and a speed camera repeater sign, shall be
sited so that one repeater sign is visible in each photograph captured by TASCAR.
3.11.1
Making one repeater sign visible in each photograph captured by TASCAR may require the provision of
an additional repeater sign at each speed measuring device location.
3.12
Existing traffic signs that conflict or have the potential to conflict with the speed limit to be enforced
using TASCAR shall be identified for removal, covering or, in the case of variable message signs,
disabling so that they do not display a conflicting speed limit or other conflicting information when
TASCAR is in operation.
NOTE
The design and implementation of plans to disable existing variable message signs is likely to require
engagement and coordination with the Overseeing Organisation's control centre personnel.
3.13
Where calibration markings are required for a speed measuring device to be compliant with its HOTA,
CD 130 [Ref 3.N]and CC 130 [Ref 2.N]shall be used for the design and construction of the temporary
road markings.
NOTE
Calibration markings are not considered to be traffic signs in the applicable traffic signs regulations.
Power supplies for TASCAR equipment
3.14
The means of powering TASCAR equipment shall be determined.
3.14.1
Mains electricity for TASCAR may be obtained from existing power supplies for roadside technology
and communications where sufficient, spare electrical and physical capacity exists, or from on-site
generators.
3.14.2
Existing power supplies that are dedicated to road lighting or traffic signals should not be used for
TASCAR unless all other options are impracticable.
NOTE
Responsibility for determining and demonstrating whether existing power supplies have sufficient,
spare electrical and physical capacity to power TASCAR equipment rests with the TASCAR designer.

3. Detailed design requirements for TASCAR
3.15
Agreement for the use of existing power supplies for TASCAR shall be obtained from the Overseeing
Organisation prior to incorporation of such a feature in the designs for TASCAR.
NOTE
Obtaining agreement from the Overseeing Organisation for the use of existing power supplies for
TASCAR is likely to necessitate consultation with different parties within the Overseeing Organisation
including, for example, scheme managers, asset managers and maintenance managers.
3.16
Where electricity for TASCAR is to be obtained from existing power supplies, designs for TASCAR shall:
1)
maintain the electrical and physical integrity of the existing power supply installations;
2)
allow for connections to unmetered supplies in accordance with TG 411 [Ref 5.N]('Electricity
supply connections'); and
3)
include a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities for the ongoing inspection and
maintenance of the existing power supply installations to which TASCAR equipment is to be
connected.
3.17
Power supplies for TASCAR shall be as per the manufacturer's recommendations for the selected
speed measuring device.
3.18
Power supplies for TASCAR shall be as required by the HOTA for the selected speed measuring device.
NOTE
The Speedmeter, Traffic Light and Prohibited Lane Enforcement Camera Handbook ( SM v2.0 [Ref
10.N]), section 6.2.3, provides further information on the requirements when using mains electricity
supplies for speed measurement devices.
3.19
Electrical installations for TASCAR shall be designed in accordance with BS 7671 [Ref 7.N].
Telecommunications services for TASCAR

as required by the HOTA for the selected speed measuring device;
2)
independent of the Overseeing Organisation's telecommunications services;
3)
secured against unauthorised access; and
4)
available for at least 99% of the time for which TASCAR is deployed.
Cable ducting and cabling
3.21
Cable routes for power and communications cabling shall be designed to ensure TASCAR operation is
unaffected by any wider works.
3.21.1
Preventing TASCAR operation from being affected by any wider works areas may involve protecting
cables within a duct network, using armoured cables or directing cable routes away from works areas.
3.21.2
Where temporary cables for TASCAR are routed above ground, they should be:
1)
sleeved in ducts of a colour complying with the Guidelines on the Positioning and Colour Coding
of Utilities' Apparatus ( NJUG 1 [Ref 9.N]); and
2)
raised off the ground so that the installation is visible amongst its surroundings.
3.21.3
Ducts containing temporary cables for TASCAR may be raised off the ground by, for example, attaching
the duct to a fence or stakes.
Support structures for TASCAR
3.22
Support structures for TASCAR, including any sub-structures, shall be designed so that they:
1)
are as required by the HOTA for the selected speed measuring device;

systems
Secondary check measurements of vehicle speed are reliably
within ±10% of the vehicle's actual speed.
4
Accuracy and reliability of baseline link length
measurements
Average speed TASCAR
systems
The baseline link length measurements entered in the
TASCAR system are measured to an accuracy of ±1 m.
5
Quality of images
All TASCAR systems
For violation record images captured by the TASCAR system:
1) The make and model of each vehicle can be identified for
images captured during daylight;
2) The make and model of each vehicle can be identified for
images captured during the hours of darkness.
3) The registration number of each vehicle is legible.
4) Any reference marks that are used by the TASCAR
system are visible.
5) A speed limit repeater sign is visible.
6
Background radio field strength
All TASCAR systems
The background radio field strength at each on-road TASCAR
equipment location is no greater than that specified in The
Speedmeter, Traffic Light and Prohibited Lane Enforcement
Camera Handbook ( SM v2.0 [Ref 10.N]).

4. Commissioning, calibration and verification r...
4.4.1
Drive-through tests with a reference vehicle, which is equipped with a calibrated speed measurement
and location tracking device, should be used for the inspection, measurement and testing of:
1)
the accuracy and reliability of the TASCAR installation's speed measurements;
2)
the accuracy and reliability of baseline link length measurements for average speed TASCAR
systems; and
3)
the quality of images captured by the TASCAR system.
4.4.2
For the purposes of carrying out measurements and tests of the accuracy and reliability of the TASCAR
installation's speed measurements using a reference vehicle, the speed limit used by the TASCAR
system to establish when an offence has occurred may be temporarily lowered so that the reference
vehicle does not have to exceed the speed limit that applies to the road and can travel at the prevailing
traffic speed.
4.5
The TASCAR inspection, measurement and testing plan shall include the methodology to be used for:
1)
keeping each EA informed throughout the implementation of the inspection, measurement and
testing plan;
2)
calibrating the inspection, measurement and testing devices used in the inspection,
measurement and testing of TASCAR installations;
3)
producing calibration certificates for the inspection, measurement and testing devices used in the
inspection, measurement and testing of TASCAR installations which are signed and dated by the
person(s) responsible for their preparation;
4)
producing records of all inspections, measurements and tests which are signed and dated by the
person(s) responsible for their preparation; and
5)
producing a certificate which confirms compliance of the TASCAR installation with its HOTA and
the accuracy of the inspection, measurement and testing documentation, and is signed and dated
by the person responsible for its preparation.
TASCAR traffic signs verification plan
4.6
A TASCAR traffic signs verification plan shall be produced.
4.7
The TASCAR traffic signs verification plan shall provide the methodology to be used for the inspection
and checking of the traffic signs associated with TASCAR against the acceptance criteria in Table 4.7,
including:
1)
details of the traffic signs to be inspected and checked;
2)
the frequency of the inspection and checking of traffic signs;
3)
the inspection and checking procedures;
4)
the form of the documentation to be produced to record the inspection and checking of traffic
signs, including, for each set of inspections and checks:
a)
the name(s) of the person(s) carrying out the inspections and checks;
b)
the date and start time for the inspections and checks;
c)
the date and completion time for the inspections and checks;
d)
the plan of the traffic signs being inspected and checked;
e)
the date and time of the inspection or check of each traffic sign;
f)
any issues identified during the inspections and checks;
g)
any actions taken to resolve issues identified during the inspections and checks;
h)
any actions needed to resolve issues identified during the inspections and checks; and
i)
signing and dating of the documentation by the person(s) responsible for its preparation.
5)
the frequency of which documentation from the inspection and checking of traffic signs is to be
provided to the Overseeing Organisation and each EA.
