Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document, CD 536, is newly published. Much of the content of this document derives from the
Specification for Highway Works (SHW) Series 0500 Drainage and Service Ducts and the Highway
Construction Details (HCD) F series which are withdrawn.
This document gives the requirements and advice for the design of chambers for drainage pipes on
motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. The document can be read in conjunction with the following:
1)
Design of highway drainage systems - CG 501 [Ref 1.I];
2)
The certification of drainage design - CG 502 [Ref 3.I];
3)
Chamber tops and gully tops for road drainage and services - CD 534 [Ref 1.N];
4)
Concrete manholes and inspection chambers, unreinforced, steel fibre and reinforced - BS EN
1917 [Ref 2.N];
5)
Concrete pipes and ancillary concrete products - BS 5911-3 [Ref 3.N];
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 2.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition (optional)
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 5.N]

Chambers for drainage pipes
Chambers for drainage pipes include manholes, catchpits,
inspection chambers, draw pits and walled soakaways.
Catchpit
Chamber incorporating sediment collection sump
Inspection chamber
Chamber with a removable cover constructed on a drain or sewer
that permits the introduction of cleaning and inspection equipment
from surface level, but does not provide access to personnel.
Manhole
Chamber with working space at pipe/drain/sewer level used for
entry of personnel and equipment.
Chamber cover slab
The reinforced cast in situ, or reinforced precast concrete cover, that
acts as a platform to cap the chamber as well as provide a base for
any regulating brickwork prior to finishing with the chamber cover.
Chamber cover
Either a chamber top or gully top (refer to CD 534 [Ref 1.N] for
definitions).
Adjusting unit
A component to adjust the total height of the chamber, and cover
and frame, to achieve the finished cover level
Chamber foundation
Comprises a chamber base slab, a chamber base and chamber
base walls.
Chamber benching
A profiled smooth mortar infill haunching that is located between the
chamber walls and the internal channel pipe
Chamber safety chain
A grip for personnel that access the chamber from being swept
along a pipe in an emergency
Reducing slab
A precast concrete slab which reduces the diameter of a chamber
Landing slab
A precast concrete safety platform within deeper chambers
Weep or bore pipe
A pipe laid in the pipe bedding material and connecting into the
chamber to provide a drainage path for water in the trench to flow
into the chamber
Waterway area
The total area of all the slots in a grating through which water can
pass
