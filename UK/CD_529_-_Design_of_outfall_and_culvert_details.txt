Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives the requirements and advice for the design of outfalls and culverts. It
supplements the guidance given in CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N] and explains how the guidance in that
document applies to motorways and all purpose trunk roads.
In this document 'outfall' is a physical asset at the point where a drainage system discharges into a
different type of drainage system. The purpose of such an outfall is to discharge water from a drainage
system into a receiving water body at a specific location without causing erosion or embankment
instability. Note that the definition for an outfall used in this document is focused on a different aspect of
an outfall relative to the definition given in CD 535 [Ref 3.I]. In CD 535 the emphasis is on an 'outfall'
demarcating the ownership boundary between an Overseeing Organisation's highway drainage
network and a third party drainage system and might, or might not be coincident with a physical asset.
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 2.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

Terms and definitions
Terms and definitions
Term
Definition
Culvert
A culvert is defined as a buried conduit which carries, or is
intended to carry, flow from a watercourse, and which does not
form part of a larger pipe network.
Environmental protection
agency
The legislative body responsible for managing the quality of water
bodies and flood risk in public watercourses.
Groundwater
All water below the surface of the ground and in direct contact with
the ground or subsoil.
Outfall
In this document 'outfall' is a physical asset to mitigate erosion or
embankment instability at the point where a drainage system
discharges into a different type of drainage system or receiving
water body.
Outlet
The point at which water flows from a sub-surface continuous
asset (such as a pipe) to an open surface asset (such as a ditch or
a pond).
Screen
A screen at the inlet and outlet (or outfall) of a culvert can deter
unauthorised access. A screen on the inlet of a culvert can prevent
debris from entering a culvert and causing a blockage.
Surface water
A watercourse, lake, pond, reservoir, canal or stretch of coastal
water.
Water body
A body of surface water or groundwater.

Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 3.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by

Design of outfalls
2.1
Where an outfall is to a public watercourse, the design shall be determined in consultation with the
environmental protection agency.
2.2
The guidance on the hydraulic design of outfalls, as given in Chapter 12 of CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N], shall
be used in the design of outfalls.
2.3
The design of screens on outfalls shall follow the guidance in Chapter 4 of CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N].

3. Design of culverts
3.
Design of culverts
3.1
The presence and probable size of culverts shall be determined early in the design process.
NOTE 1
Culverts beneath highways have to accommodate restrictions imposed by carriageway alignment and
road construction, as these affect the cover to the top of the culvert.
NOTE 2
Culverts can be designed to facilitate crossings of highway ditches or channels.
NOTE 3
Culverts can be designed to transfer the drainage run from one side of the carriageway to the other.
3.2
Where a culvert conveys a public watercourse, the design shall be determined in consultation with the
environmental protection agency.
NOTE
Where a culvert conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse, no consultation is required.
3.3
The guidance on the hydraulic design of culverts, as given in Chapter 12 of CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N], shall
be used in the design of culverts.
NOTE 1
Culverts with a diameter or clear span of 900 mm or less are not structures and are considered to have
a design life of 60 years.
NOTE 2
Culverts with a diameter or clear span greater than 900 mm are structures and the design life for such
structures is given in CD 350 [Ref 5.I].
3.4
Where a circular culvert is longer than 12 metres it shall be at least 1.2 metres in diameter to facilitate
access for maintenance.
3.5
Where a box culvert is longer than 12 metres it shall have both span and height at least 1.2 metres to
facilitate access for maintenance.
3.5.1
The minimum culvert diameter should be 450 mm as smaller sizes are prone to blockage.
3.6
The design of screens to culverts shall follow the guidance in Chapter 4 of CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N].
3.7
Where a safety risk assessment identifies a need for a screen, this shall be provided.
3.8
The provision of screens to culverted public watercourses shall be discussed and agreed with the
environmental protection agency.
3.9
Where a culvert conveys a public watercourse, its invert shall be depressed below the natural bed level
as described in Chapters 9 and 11 of CIRIA C786 [Ref 1.N].
3.10
Where a culvert conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse, the invert shall be at least 75
mm below the bed of the drain.
NOTE
This is to ensure that water does not pond in front of the culvert.
3.11
Where a culvert conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse, the sides of the drain shall
be higher than the culvert soffit.
3.12
Where a culvert conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse, the headwall of the culvert
shall extend into the banks of the drain over the full depth.
3.12.1
The headwall of a culvert which conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse may be a
simple brick structure, cast in situ concrete, reinforced concrete or concrete bagwork.
3.13
Where a culvert conveys a highway drain that is not a public watercourse, a concrete apron shall be
designed in front of the headwall to suppress vegetation growth immediately upstream of the inlet and
downstream of the outlet.
3.14
Where a culvert conveys a carriageway channel, it shall be designed to carry the design flow without
surcharging.
3.14.1
Where a culvert conveys a carriageway channel, it may be designed to carry more than the design flow
to allow for sediment deposition within the culvert.
