Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document contains inspection and assessment requirements for traffic signalling systems.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
It is assumed that the parties reading TS 101 are aware of additional documents to those within the
DMRB. The Department for Transport (DfT) prepares general advice, some of which is applicable to
motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. Of these documents, the most relevant are Local Transport
Notes (LTN), and Traffic Advisory Leaflets (TAL), which mostly cover topics which apply to local rather
than strategic roads, but some are of general relevance.
