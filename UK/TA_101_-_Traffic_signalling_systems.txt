2. Appraisal

Appraisal
Appraisal report
2.1
An appraisal report shall be produced prior to the commencement of the preferred traffic signalling
installation design(s).
2.1.1
An experienced person with traffic signalling knowledge should be included within the appraisal team
and a decision for their inclusion recorded in the appraisal report.
NOTE
The level of experience and knowledge of the experienced person with traffic signalling knowledge has
no definition, but the level of competency can be assessed through previous experience and CV.
2.1.2
The appraisal team should comprise of those with relevant knowledge on other elements of the traffic
signalling installation(s) and a decision for their inclusion recorded in the appraisal report.
NOTE
Relevant knowledge depends on the scope of the traffic signalling installation(s) and can include
transport planning/modelling elements of the installation(s).
2.1.3
Where technical aspects of the traffic signalling installation(s) require clarification, a technical note
should be produced to support the appraisal report.
Data collection
2.2
The design file shall include site-specific data relevant to the traffic signalling installation(s).
2.2.1
Site-specific data relevant to traffic signalling installation(s) may include speed data, statutory
undertakers searches, accident data, traffic and walking, cycling and horse-riding demand flows,
inspection reports, and incident reports (near misses and known health and safety issues).
NOTE
The list of site-specific data for traffic signalling installation(s) is not exhaustive and other relevant data
can be used to obtain appropriate information.
2.2.2
The site-specific data obtained for the traffic signalling installation(s) should be used to inform the
design stage.
NOTE
Existing traffic signalling installation configuration data can be a source of site-specific data if
modification is part of the work to be carried out.
Site conditions
2.3
Site conditions shall be assessed prior to commencement of traffic signalling installation design and
recorded in the design file.
2.3.1
Site conditions may be assessed by desktop study (reviewing previous reports), video surveys, site
visit, ecological surveys, interview surveys, walking, cycling & horse-riding assessment and review,
traffic counts and speed surveys.
2.3.2
An assessment of the surrounding environment should be performed to ensure the sensitivity of the
landscape, heritage and local community are not detrimentally affected by the traffic signalling
installation design.
NOTE 1
An assessment of the surrounding environment can be achieved through a desktop study of the area
and a risk assessment.
NOTE 2
A video survey to review traffic and other user behaviours is an example of an assessment of the
surrounding environment.
2.3.3
The compatibility of traffic control equipment with existing traffic signal installations that are being
modified should be determined.
NOTE
Associated traffic signals equipment can include bus priority systems, CCTV and variable message
signs (VMS).
