Introduction
Introduction
Background
Traffic detection is an operational function that provides input data to systems, which process the data
to deliver particular outputs. Traffic detection systems are used to support:
1)
Safety - early and accurate detection of incidents that triggers appropriate operational responses;
2)
User satisfaction - early detection of events, enabling communication of issues affecting network
performance to customers, with appropriate alternative advice; and
3)
The smooth flow of traffic - incident resolution and network availability is enhanced by early and
accurate incident detection.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

MIDAS can perform three basic functions:
1) queue protection
2) congestion monitoring
3) traffic data collection
MIDAS sets signals and message signs
automatically when certain abnormal traffic
conditions occur and clears them automatically
when traffic conditions return to normal.
Motorway incorporating variable mandatory
speed limits
All forms of motorway which have variable
mandatory speed limits, including those with a hard

3. Detectors for motorway incident detection and...
NOTE
Primary sites for detectors are the first to be sited when designing a scheme. When the primary sites
have been identified, other sites can be located in relation to the primary sites in accordance with
spacing requirements.
3.2
Where detection functions for roadside technology and communications require multiple detector sites,
the spacing of detectors between primary sites shall meet operational requirements for detection
resolution.
NOTE
MIDAS-based incident detection uses a detection resolution of 500 m +100/-200 m for all types of
highway, with a scheme average tolerance of +50/-100 m.
3.3
One set of loop-based detectors for MIDAS detection equipment for roadside technology and
communications shall be used on both carriageways mid-link, when the majority of detectors to be
installed on the link are non-loop detectors.
NOTE 1
These non-loop detectors include (but are not limited to) side-fire radars and magnetometers.
NOTE 2
The midpoint loops-based MIDAS site are to be used as a reference point for the calibration of all other
types of detectors on the link.
3.4
A gap in traffic detection provision for roadside technology and communications shall not be created
between existing traffic detection locations or diverge connector roads adjacent to the scheme.
NOTE
For MIDAS-based incident detection, a gap of less than four signal sites creates a discontinuity in the
network detection provision.

Stopped vehicle detection for roadside technology and
communications
Provision of stopped vehicle detection for roadside technology and
communications
4.1
On all links comprising a motorway incorporating variable mandatory speed limits (VMSL) without a
hard shoulder, i.e. all lane running, stopped vehicle detection (SVD) for roadside technology and
communications shall be provided to meet the operational requirements of the Overseeing
Organisation.
NOTE 1
An all lane running carriageway link could have SVD provided throughout the length of that carriageway
link in accordance with these requirements, even if there were some sections of hard shoulder within
that link.
NOTE 2
A controlled motorway carriageway link could not have any SVD provision, in accordance with these
requirements, even if that link contained some sections without a hard shoulder.
NOTE 3
The operational regime and resultant SVD provision is determined separately for each carriageway.
4.2
On all intra-junction sections that are within the scheme extents of a motorway incorporating VMSL
without a hard shoulder, i.e. all lane running, SVD for roadside technology and communications shall
be provided to meet the operational requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
An intra-junction section in an all lane running scheme which retains hard shoulders would have SVD
provision in accordance with these requirements.
4.3
SVD for roadside technology and communications shall provide at least 95% coverage of mainline
running lanes per link per carriageway.
4.4
SVD for roadside technology and communications shall provide at least 95% coverage of each
mainline emergency area within the SVD coverage area.
4.5
SVD for roadside technology and communications shall provide at least 95% coverage of each
mainline place of relative safety within the coverage area.
NOTE
All safety benefits of SVD are only realised where there is traffic camera coverage of the SVD coverage
area.
4.6
SVD coverage on merge connector roads for roadside technology and communications shall
commence from the back of the merge connector road nose and extend downstream.
4.7
SVD coverage on diverge connector roads for roadside technology and communications shall extend
from the mainline to the back of the diverge connector road nose.
4.7.1
SVD coverage on the diverge connector road for roadside technology and communications may be
extended downstream of the back of the diverge connector road nose where;
1)
there is a location-specific safety hazard relating to stopped vehicles on a diverge connector
road, and
2)
where supported by a safety risk assessment that identifies SVD as a proportionate control
measure.
4.8
Connector roads with restricted access within a link which has VMSL without a hard shoulder, i.e. all
lane running, shall have SVD coverage in accordance with this section for roadside technology and
communications.
NOTE
Connector roads with restricted access include provision for depots, works units and turnaround points.
Both merge and diverge connector roads are included.
4.8.1
SVD coverage on a connector road with restricted access for roadside technology and communications
may be extended downstream of the back of the diverge connector nose or upstream of the merge
connector nose where:

1)
there is a location-specific safety hazard relating to stopped vehicles on a connector road with
restricted access; and,
2)
where supported by a safety risk assessment that identifies SVD as a proportionate control
measure.
NOTE
The activity being taken into account in the safety risk assessment is the associated hazards and risks
with road users using connector roads with restricted access as stopping places.
4.9
Any gap in SVD coverage of greater than 5 m in length for roadside technology and communications,
and which extends across more than half a lane's width, shall be subject to a safety risk assessment
with measures to mitigate risks associated with a stopped vehicle incorporated, to demonstrate that
risks have been reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.
NOTE 1
SVD coverage levels and gaps are set to meet the reasonable expectation that a stopped vehicle could
be detectable.
NOTE 2
SVD is only one component in a range of potential measures to mitigate the risks associated with
stopped vehicles.
Siting of stopped vehicle detection for roadside technology and
communications
4.10
SVD detectors for roadside technology and communications shall be sited and mounted to enable
detection at all times.
4.11
SVD detectors for roadside technology and communications shall be sited and mounted to enable
differentiation between vehicles stopped in mainline live lanes and vehicles stopped in mainline places
of relative safety.
4.12
SVD detectors for roadside technology and communications shall be sited and mounted in
consideration of the wider highway and roadside technology design, such that they continuously
provide the required coverage throughout the scheme's design life.
NOTE
Reasonably foreseeable impediments to continuously providing the required coverage could include
future vegetation growth or a planned change to the roadside assets or layout which could affect
detection reach or accuracy.
4.12.1
SVD detectors and associated roadside equipment for roadside technology and communications
should be co-located with other roadside technology equipment for efficient construction and ongoing
maintenance.
4.12.2
SVD detectors for roadside technology and communications may be standalone or attached to gantry
legs using brackets.

Traffic counting detectors for roadside technology and
communications
Provision of traffic counting detectors for roadside technology and
communications
5.1
Traffic counting detectors for roadside technology and communications shall be provided where traffic
monitoring capabilities are required.
NOTE
Traffic counting detectors are provided to monitor traffic flows, vehicle speeds and vehicle classification.
5.1.1
The Overseeing Organisation should be consulted to confirm the need for traffic monitoring for roadside
technology and communications.
NOTE
Typically, one traffic counting site per link is provided that is aligned across all lanes on both
carriageways. Other configurations can be applied for traffic counting sites on, for example, link roads.
