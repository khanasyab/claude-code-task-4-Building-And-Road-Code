Foreword
This document provides specifier instructions for the production of the works specific requirements for
CC 120 Construction of permanent traffic signs, road markings and road studs.
This document does not form part of the works specification.
The works specification is made up of both the Specification for Highway Works and the works specific
requirements completed by the Specifier.
This document is applicable for contracts throughout the UK, complemented by the additional
specification requirements and contractual changes of each Overseeing Organisation.
Users are responsible for applying all appropriate documents applicable to their contract.
Users are responsible for archiving contract documentation in accordance with the user's quality
management system.

studs
1.1
This document shall apply to permanent traffic signs, including upright traffic signs, parallel and zebra

markings and road studs, which are intended to remain in position on completion of the permanent
works.

1.3
Permanent light-emitting variable message traffic signs shall comply with "Variable message signs and
signals for roadside technology and communications" in Section 8 of TC 131 [Ref 21.N].
Electrical installations for permanent traffic signs
1.4
Electrical installations for permanent traffic signs shall comply with "General requirements for electrical
work for road lighting and illuminated traffic signs" in Section 1 of TC 501 [Ref 3.N].

1.5
Foundations for permanent traffic signs shall comply with one of the following options: "Planted
foundations for minor structures, excluding steel CCTV masts and steel high masts " in Section 13 of
CC 481 [Ref 10.N], "Foundations for minor structures with flange plates " in Section 14 of CC 481 [Ref
10.N], or "Prefabricated reinforced concrete foundations for minor structures" in Section 15 of CC 481
[Ref 10.N].
Asset and product identification labels for permanent traffic signs
1.6
Where the Overseeing Organisation has determined an asset identification label is required, a unique
asset identification label - i.e. the asset identification label provided in the WSR in each section of this
document - shall be affixed to each permanent traffic sign, unless otherwise stated in CC 120/WSR/001.
Works Specific Requirements to be provided within the WSR template where applicable are:
SI.1.6
The requirement for asset identification labels for permanent traffic signs is altered as follows: [enter

For a period of not less than ten years following installation or opening to traffic, whichever is later,
asset and product identification labels affixed to permanent traffic signs shall remain legible and, for
adhesive labels, not become detached or curled at the edges.
Verification for permanent traffic signs
1.10
Verification shall be undertaken for each permanent traffic sign with light-emitting or mechanical
components - e.g. flap signs, electromechanical variable message traffic signs, globes, flashing lights
- to confirm by testing that the permanent traffic sign is operating in accordance with the applicable
traffic signs regulations and the requirements of this document.
