Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document should be read in conjunction with the current health and safety legislation relevant to
the highway construction industry.
The records described by this document may not be sufficient for effective management in all
circumstances. Where this is the case, supplementary records can be compiled.
The document also identifies how the records should be held and those parties responsible for
creating, maintaining, reviewing and updating records.
The records described in this document are specifically identified to support the business needs and
processes for managing highway structures, important aspects of which include:
1) providing information the Overseeing Organisations are legally required to hold;
2) providing information that supports the management of highway structures, e.g. inspection
scheduling, maintenance planning, structural reviews and assessments;
3) ensuring that records remain current and accurate by adopting appropriate reviewing and updating
procedures;
4) ensuring that records are held in the required format, e.g. computerised asset management
systems;
5) ensuring that records are created, maintained and managed by the relevant personnel/parties.
Details of the manner in which these records are to be held by respective Overseeing Organisations
are provided within the National Application Annexes (NAA).
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

2.
Managing records
General
2.1
Records shall be collected for highway structures and the appropriate parties responsible for providing,
maintaining, reviewing and updating these records are described.
NOTE 1
The details of some records are described in other documentation, e.g. DMRB documents and
respective user manuals/guides for computerised asset management systems. Where this is the case,
the descriptions of the records are not duplicated in this document, instead the appropriate cross
reference is provided. Where descriptions of records are not provided elsewhere then a description is
provided in this document.
NOTE 2
Records can be held in different formats, but are typically held as electronic or hard copy (electronic
records can be held in different formats). Formats are defined in the NAA, and in some cases
supporting documents are referenced which define the format.
2.1.1
The records defined in this document should be consistent with CDM Regulation requirements in SI
2015/51 [Ref 8.N] and good asset management practice.
2.1.2
Additional records may be useful to support design and maintenance activities.
NOTE
Exclusion of additional records from this document does not preclude parties from holding them, but the
Overseeing Organisations do not accept any financial or other responsibilities for these records unless
formally agreed.

2.2
The asset management systems defined by Overseeing Organisations, with associated user manuals
and help files, shall be used.
NOTE 1
Details of asset management systems are provided in the NAA.
NOTE 2
The Overseeing Organisations have computerised asset management systems for highway structures.
These systems hold records, assist the creation and maintenance of records, and support
management processes, e.g. inspection and maintenance planning.
NOTE 3
Computerised management systems have associated user manuals and help files, which are
periodically updated to provide additional guidance to users and/or to reflect changes and
improvements to the system. This document does not replicate the guidance provided in user
manuals/help files; instead this document refers to these documents where necessary.
2.3
Where this document refers to user manuals/help files these shall be taken to be the latest versions.
NOTE
The latest versions of user manuals/help files can be obtained from the Overseeing Organisations.
Contact details are available from the relevant organisations.
Roles and responsibilities
2.4
The roles and responsibilities required for the creation and ongoing maintenance, review and updating
of records are described in detail in the NAA and shall be followed.

Appendix A. Example tables
Table A.8 Information sheet: Notes for inspection and maintenance (worked example) (continued)
Central pier base
Excavation to founding level revealed some small fissures in the
underlying sandstone. These were cleaned out, inspected and grouted
up prior to construction of the base slab. Further details are given in the
report, sketch and correspondence following these notes.
Drainage
Bearing shelf drainage at abutments and centre pier should be
inspected and cleared as necessary. The outlet pipes should be
inspected and rodded. Gullies at base of abutments should be
inspected and cleared as necessary. The rear face drainage layer
outfalls by underground pipe to manholes. These outlets should be
inspected to ensure they are functioning correctly. Any significant
accumulations of silt and debris on the bearing shelf or in the drainage
system should be noted and investigated.
Waterproofing
The bridge deck east service bay has a waterproof membrane of mastic
asphalt. The west service bay invert is waterproofed with Conidec. Any
defects in the deck surfacing should be investigated to assess possible
damage to the waterproofing. The service bay cover slabs are covered
by Bituthene and Bitushield. Deck waterproofing is to remain intact for
the reinforcement in the deck slab to be protected as required.
Joints
Sealants to expansion and movement joints should be checked for
deterioration. The epoxy mortar transition strips should be checked for
debonding or cracking. Holding down bolts to cover plates should be
checked for tightness.
Bearings
Guides and dowels and rubber pot bearings should be inspected to
ensure they are functioning correctly and to note any failure or
excessive wear of moving elements. Metal sections of bearings, guides
and dowels should be checked for corrosion and painted as necessary.
Rubber bearings should be inspected to ensure that the rubber
protection to the steel laminations has not cracked or debonded. The
condition of the bearing seating material should also be checked.
Holding-down bolts should be checked for tightness and any welds
checked for cracking.
Alkali-aggregate reactivity
During the construction contract period the Overseeing Organisation
issued additional substitute specification clauses to cover potential
alkali-aggregate problems. The Test House (give name) carried out an
assessment of the aggregates and concrete with particular reference to
concrete mix details and cement contents. Calculations using the
figures given in the Test House (give name) report with information from
cement provided (give name) gave total alkali contents for the class 45/
20 concrete marginally above the 3.0 kg/m3 maximum recommended.
Cement with a lower alkali content was used for the parapet edge
beams. For the other mixes calculations gave total alkali contents less
than 3.0 kg/m3. Further details are included in the appendix on alkali
aggregate reactivity.
Services and service bays
The services carried on the deck are indicated on the drawings.
Particular attention should be paid to the pipe bays to ensure they are
properly drained and that services are not leaking. It should be noted
that the pipe bays are not designed to carry backfill. Vent pipes with
flame traps lead from each service bay, to prevent pressure build up in
the event of a mains failure.
Etc.
