LD 119 replaces LA 119 which superseded HA 65/94 and HA 66/95. This full
document has been re-written to make it compliant with the new Highways
England drafting rules. LD 119 was originally published as LA 119 in October
2019 and is now republished as LD 119 as the requirements are design
requirements (D) and it was incorrectly coded as appraisal requirements before
this time (A).

Absorptive noise barrier
A noise barrier that has an absorptive lining.
A-weighting
In addition to its non-linear amplitude response, the human ear
has a non-linear frequency response; it is less sensitive at low and
high frequencies and most sensitive in the mid range frequencies.
NOTE 1: The A-weighting is applied to measured sound pressure
levels so that these levels correspond more closely to the
subjective response.
NOTE 2: A-weighted noise levels are often expressed in dB(A).
Decibel
The unit of measurement used for sound pressure levels and
noise levels quoted in decibels (dB).
NOTE 1: The decibel scale is logarithmic rather than linear; the
threshold of hearing is zero decibels while, at the other extreme,
the threshold of pain is about 130 decibels.
NOTE 2: These limits are seldom experienced and typical levels
lie within the range of 30 dB(A) (a quiet night time level in a
bedroom) to 90 dB(A) (at the kerbside of a busy road).
Earth bund
A bund constructed to provide noise or landscape mitigation.
Environmental assessment
A process by which information about environmental effects is
collected, assessed and used to inform decision-making.
NOTE: This includes Environmental Impact Assessment and
non-statutory environmental assessment.
Insertion loss
A measure of the effectiveness of noise control devices such as
silencers and enclosures.
NOTE: The insertion loss of a device is the difference, in dB,
between the noise level with and without the device present.
Noise barrier
Fence placed between a road and a noise sensitive receptor to
reduce noise levels. Includes all elements of the fence (posts and
fixings, as well as panels).
Parallel barrier
A noise barrier where there are existing or proposed barriers on
the opposite side of the road.
Reflective noise barrier
A noise barrier that reflects noise.
Roadside environmental
mitigation
Measure installed on the land between a highway and the
boundary of land owned by the Overseeing Organisation to
mitigate environmental effects of the highway.
Single barrier
A noise barrier where there are no existing or proposed barriers
on the opposite side of the road.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used to specify roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement measures,
which are measures installed between the nearside carriageway edge and the boundary of land
controlled, or planned to be controlled, by the Overseeing Organisation to reduce the impact of the
highway on the surrounding environment in terms of:
1) noise;
2) landscape and,
3) visual impact.
1.1.1
Roadside environmental mitigation or enhancement measures may include:
1) earth bunds constructed to mitigate noise, landscape impact and visual impact;
2) visual screens; and/or
3) noise barriers.
NOTE
Roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement measures are normally specified in
environmental assessment reports produced as part of the requirements of LA 104 [Ref 2.N].
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all projects which require roadside environmental
mitigation or enhancement on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads
according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 5.N].

2. Principles and purpose
2.
Principles and purpose
2.1
Roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement shall be designed to meet the general "principles
of good road design" in accordance with GG 103 [Ref 4.N].
2.1.1
The design of roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement should be coordinated with other
elements within the highway corridor and be appropriate to the scale and character of the local context.
NOTE
Aesthetic design is not limited to higher profile structures that stand out as a result of their scale or
location, but also include features that are regarded as commonplace, widespread and therefore highly
visible elements within the highway corridor.
2.2
Requirements for access determined through risk assessments undertaken in accordance with LA 113
[Ref 9.N] shall be incorporated into the design of roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement.
2.3
Roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement shall be designed to be as unobtrusive in the
landscape or townscape as possible or provide visual interest where integration is not feasible.
NOTE 1
The design process for roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement includes an evaluation of
the landscape or townscape context.
NOTE 2
The design of roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement can vary considerably in response
to individual urban, semi-urban or rural contexts.
NOTE 3
Materials and forms appropriate to the landscape or townscape context and the application of
architectural principles to the design of roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement can
reduce visual impact or provide visual interest.
2.4
Approval of structures used for roadside environmental mitigation and enhancement shall be obtained
following the procedures in CG 300 [Ref 12.N].

Noise barrier design
Location
5.1
The locations, heights and lengths of noise barriers shall be determined using information from
environmental statements or environmental assessment reports.
5.1.1
Alternative locations, heights and lengths of noise barrier, or an alternative noise mitigation or
enhancement measures, may be used where it is possible to achieve the same or better noise
reduction than a barrier determined using information from environmental statements or environmental
assessment reports.
NOTE
Noise barriers will normally be identified as requirements for mitigation within noise chapters.
5.2
Earth bunds intended for use as noise barriers shall be designed in accordance with Section 3 of this
document.
Noise barrier specification
5.3
The required sound insulation category specified by BS EN 1793-2 [Ref 11.N] shall be determined by
the addition of 15 dB(A) to the maximum insertion loss specified for the barrier in the environmental
statement or environmental assessment report.
NOTE
For example, if the insertion loss for a barrier was determined as 3 dB(A), the required sound insulation
is to be 18 dB(A), requiring a class B2 barrier.
5.4
Where the environmental statement or environmental assessment report states that an absorptive
barrier is required, the sound absorption shall be determined by BS EN 1793-1 [Ref 10.N], and:
1) where the barrier is determined as a single barrier, a minimum performance of class A1; or,
2) where the barrier is determined as a parallel barrier, a minimum performance of class A3.
5.5
Discretionary or ancillary (site-specific) characteristics that can affect the design or choice of product
shall be identified.
5.5.1
Discretionary or ancillary (site-specific) characteristics that can affect the design or choice of product
may include:
1) brush fire, shatter (wilful damage) properties, light reflectivity;
2) climatic conditions in the proposed location, including wind, flooding and snow;
3) aesthetics and sustainability with reference to GG 103 [Ref 4.N].
5.6
A generic product shall be selected to be used as the basis for design assumptions.
5.7
The generic product shall:
1) have an acoustic durability of a maximum of 0.25 dB loss per year;
2) have a non-acoustic durability of at least 20 years;
3) meet the requirements in this section for earth bunds used as noise barriers, specifying the sound
insulation category, and sound absorption for required absorptive barriers.
5.8
The characteristics of the generic product shall be used to derive self weight.
5.9
The self weight shall be used to calculate the following loading on the acoustic elements:
1) vertical loading;
2) normal (90o) wind and static loading;
3) where snow blowers are used in the barrier location, normal (90o) loading from snow clearance.
