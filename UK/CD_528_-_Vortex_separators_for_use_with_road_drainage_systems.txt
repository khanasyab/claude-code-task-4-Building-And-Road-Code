Introduction
Introduction
Background
The principle operation of the vortex separator is to use tangential flow into the chamber to induce
rotational motion in the fluid where a combination of gravity and boundary layer effects separate solids
from the liquid.
The hydraulic design ensures that the action of the circulating flow exerts a much greater tangential
force on the solids than the friction resulting from the centrifugal force generated by the rotating flow.
Differential velocities and the low energy of the vortex allow the denser sediment and grit material to
settle in the chamber while oil and floatables are retained in circulating flow on the surface. The
hydraulic characteristic of the core shape ensures the settled sediments are retained within the base of
the device irrespective of the velocities of the flow through the device.
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 3.N].
Assumptions in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
A vortex separator is assumed to have no minimum flow velocity at which it operates.
Vortex separators are assumed to operate at all velocities of flow; even below the design limit.

Design requirements
Hydraulic inflow and outflow design
2.1
Where the drainage system design in accordance with CG 501 [Ref 1.N] utilises a vortex separator, the
system's pipe design shall be compatible with the requirements of a (or range of) vortex separator(s).
2.2
Where the drainage system design includes a vortex separator, the design shall assume that the inflow
to the vortex separator is via a central core or an external annulus.
2.3
Where the inlet pipe to the vortex separator is submerged it shall maintain a positive hydraulic gradient.
2.3.1
The inlet pipe into the vortex separator may be required to be submerged, in accordance with
manufacturer's instructions.
2.4
Where a submerged inlet pipe is required, the outlet pipe from the vortex separator shall have a lower
invert level than the inlet pipe's upstream invert level.
2.5
Contributing pipelines shall be connected to a chamber upstream of the vortex separator.
2.5.1
The upstream chamber should be a manhole rather than a catchpit to minimise turbulence and
maintain stable flow conditions in the inlet pipe to the vortex separator.
2.6
Only one inlet pipe and one outlet pipe shall be connected to the vortex separator.
2.7
The drainage system design shall minimise turbulence and maintain stable flow conditions in the pipe
upstream of the vortex separator.
2.7.1
A vortex separator should be designed within the drainage system to remove sediment and debris as
close to the source as possible.
2.7.2
Some vortex separators may include an upstream meshed basket to aid in the removal of coarse
debris.
NOTE
Locating vortex separators immediately upstream of the point of discharge does not give the greatest
hydraulic benefit to the drainage system.
2.8
The location and design of the vortex separator shall include geotechnical design aspects, including
ground stability and flotation calculations.
Designing for maintenance
2.9
In designing for maintenance, the location of the vortex separator and vehicle access and egress
routes shall not interfere with other roadside features.
2.10
In designing for maintenance, access to the central core and annulus shall be provided via a
rectangular opening in a vortex separator's cover slab.
NOTE
Locating vortex separators remotely from the outfall can be beneficial where the outfall or topography
precludes access for maintenance.
Information to be provided to Overseeing Organisation
2.11
On completion of the drainage system design, a record of the following information on vortex
separators shall be provided:
1)
maximum and minimum discharge rates into the vortex separator;
2)
the calculation of sediment load in accordance with CD 523 [Ref 2.N]; and
3)
the routine maintenance period.
2.12
The treatment capacity of the vortex separator shall be calculated by the manufacturer.
2.12.1
The calculation of treatment capacity may be based on the calculation of sediment load in accordance
with CD 523 [Ref 2.N] and the routine maintenance period.

Operation and maintenance
General
3.1
The design shall facilitate safe access to the vortex separator for operational and maintenance staff
and vehicles.
3.1.1
The vortex separator should be positioned to be clear of the carriageway and to facilitate safe access
and manoeuvring, minimising the requirement for traffic management.
NOTE
Access for maintenance vehicles, especially larger vehicles such as a vacuum tanker, can require
construction of an adjacent hard-standing designed to withstand the expected loadings.
3.1.2
On roads with all lane running or without a hard shoulder, closing lanes and even minimal traffic
management is potentially not achievable and other access solutions should be sought.
3.2
The drainage system design shall allow space to maintain the vortex separator including inspections,
emptying retained sediment and cleaning in accordance with manufacturer's requirements.
3.2.1
A vortex separator may be used to retain surface water when there is an emergency spillage which
could cause a pollution incident.
Vortex separator asset data
3.3
Vortex separators shall be recorded, on all new and existing drainage systems, as a point asset in the
Overseeing Organisation's asset management system.
3.3.1
Where the vortex separator forms part of a continuous asset it should be connected as a point asset at
each end, with one point defined as upstream and the other as downstream.
Commissioning
3.4
The commissioning phase of the vortex separator shall evidence that the vortex separator is operating
with the level of removal of sediments and debris as designed, whilst maximising maintenance intervals.
3.4.1
The commissioning phase of the vortex separator may increase or decrease the maintenance intervals
(i.e. emptying) specified at the design stage due to site conditions.
3.5
A record of the vortex separator's requirements for operation, inspection, emptying and cleaning as a
result of the design and commissioning phase shall be provided.

A1
Drainage design philosophy
Following the introduction of CD 527 [Ref 1.I] the drainage philosophy is to reduce maintenance where
practical and improve the quality of surface water runoff discharging from the carriageway. The
elimination of the gully sump may lead to an improvement in water quality. However, this can potentially
increase the amount of sediment entering the drainage system. CD 523 [Ref 2.N] provides guidance on
the design of the pipeline to transport sediment and the assessment of the volumes of sediment that a
road might generate. There is scope to further reduce maintenance activity by reducing the number or
frequency of catchpits and instead trap sediment at more centralised locations, remote from the
carriageway.
At remote locations sediment can be removed without recourse to major traffic management associated
with lane closures. The vortex separator with its comparatively small footprint would enable these aims
to be achieved. To further this, National Highways undertook a full scale trial by installing a vortex
separator during M25 widening works. An 18- month long trial monitored the volume of sediment
retained and the contaminants present in both the sediment and the water. The trial has indicated that,
when properly maintained, vortex separators offer an effective additional treatment option in any
treatment train approach, for example when used in conjunction with isolating devices and other
propriety devices. This is particularly important when the quality of runoff discharging from a highway
requires significant improvement before entering to a receiving water body.
A2
Vortex separators operation
Some versions of the vortex separator contain internal filters to remove more of the suspended solids in
the runoff, including smaller sized particles. Alternatively filters can be installed in a chamber
immediately downstream of the vortex separator. Filters can be manufactured to remove soluble
pollutants such as toxic metals, as well as suspended solids. The inclusion of a filter offers a higher
level of environment protection, but at the expense of a reduced hydraulic capacity of the vortex
separator, as filters are more effective when treating significantly lower flows than vortex separator
capacity.
Applications where low flows from sub-annual rainfall events pass through both the vortex separator
and an additional chamber containing a filter, may be the ideal system where the receiving water
environment is vulnerable. Although a bifurcation arrangement, with a downstream filter chamber
which can be bypassed, would allow the higher flows from the less frequent rainfall events to be treated
by the vortex separator only and then bypass the filter chamber.
