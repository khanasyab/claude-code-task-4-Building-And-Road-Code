Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides requirements and advice on the geometrical design of grade separated
junctions. It merges and rationalises the content of TD 22/06 and TD 39/94 and incorporates the
connector road elements of compact grade separated junctions, which were previously covered by TD
40/94.
With the incorporation of the requirements and advice of TD 39/94, this document covers the
geometrical design of grade separated junctions with up to three lanes joining or leaving the mainline.
Notable changes from the previous documents listed above include:
1) merge layout referencing has been updated to better reflect the progression in capacity provision
through the types; for example Layout D in TD 22/06 is now Layout A Option 2 in this document.
The associated flow diagram references have therefore been updated to reflect this;
2) 3-lane merge and diverge layouts from TD 39/94 have been reviewed and amended to ensure that
only those layouts that reflect the safe design ethos of the more contemporary TD 22/06 are
included;
3) merge and diverge datum points that were originally included only in Interim Advice Note 149/17 for
existing motorways have been included; and,
4) simplification of the curve widening requirements and advice relating to compact connector roads.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.

a two-way connector road between a major and a minor road
designed as part of a compact grade separated junction
Compact grade separated
junction
a grade separated junction designed with a two-way

connector road joins the major road via a priority junction
designed to CD 123 [Ref 2.N] .
Connector road
a collective term for interchange links, link roads, slip roads and
loops designed as part of a full grade separated junction. A
connector road starts/ends at the back of a diverge/merge nose.
Datum points
defined points at merges and diverges used for the purposes of
locating features such as signs and signals and measuring
weaving lengths
Direct access
a connection to an all-purpose trunk road providing access to only
one of the following, which does not provide a through route:
1) a single dwelling;
2) a single field;
3) a single use public utilities site (such as an electric substation)
where access is needed for maintenance of that specific site only;
or,
4) a single use highway maintenance site (such as an attenuation
pond) where access is needed for maintenance of that specific
site only
Downstream
that part of the carriageway(s) where the traffic is flowing away
from the section in question
Fork
an at-grade junction of two roads, usually within an interchange,
which diverge from the approach road at similar angles
NOTE: Usually both diverging roads have equal status.
Full grade separated junction
a grade separated junction designed with free-flowing merges
and/or diverges in accordance with this document
Ghost island
an area of the carriageway marked to separate lanes of traffic
travelling in the same direction on merge and diverge layouts
NOTE 1: The purpose of the ghost island at a merge is to
separate the points of entry of two slip road traffic lanes.
NOTE 2: The purpose of the ghost island at a diverge is to
separate the points of exit to a slip road.
Grade separated junction
A grade separated junction has at least two carriageway links at
different levels, and usually involves the provision of a structure to
accommodate carriageways crossing.

Terms and definitions
Terms (continued)
Term
Definition
Interchange
a grade separated junction that provides free flow from one
mainline to another
Interchange link
a connector road carrying free-flowing traffic within an interchange
between one level and/or direction and another
Intrajunction
the section of mainline within a junction, between a diverge and
merge.
Lane drop
a layout where a lane or lanes of the upstream carriageway
becomes a lane or lanes of the diverging connector road
Lane gain
a layout where a lane or lanes of the merging connector road
becomes a lane or lanes of the mainline carriageway
Link road
In the context of junctions, a link road is one-way connector road
adjacent to but separate from the mainline carriageway carrying
traffic in the same direction. It is used to connect the mainline
carriageway to the local highway network where successive direct
connections cannot be provided to an adequate standard because
the junction spacing is too close.
Loop
a connector road, one- or two-way that is made up of the
elements of the loops shown in Figure 5.10N (this document) and
which passes through an angle in the range of approximately 180
to 270 degrees
NOTE: The loop is considered to extend to the end of the near
straight length of road contiguous with the back of the diverge or
merge nose.
Mainline
the major route within a junction that typically is a higher road
classification and/or carries greater traffic volumes
Near straight
a length of connector road with a radius no less than the desirable
minimum radius with superelevation of 5% as detailed in CD 109
[Ref 3.N] for the mainline design speed
Nose
a paved area, approximately triangular in shape, situated between
merging or diverging lanes and the mainline. The nose includes
hatched road markings to discourage drivers from crossing it.
Nose ratio
Nose ratio is the ratio of the back of nose width and the nose
length.
Parallel merge/diverge
a merge or diverge layout where an auxiliary lane is provided
alongside the mainline carriageway
Priority junction
a junction controlled by a 'Give Way' or 'Stop' arrangement.
NOTE 1: Stop arrangements are only used where there are
severe visibility restrictions.
NOTE 2: Direct accesses can operate in a similar manner but are
not classed as priority junctions.
NOTE 3: A priority junction can include a merge taper where the
formal 'Give Way' road marking is replaced by an edge of
carriageway road marking.

carriageway with a speed limit of 40 mph or less, or a dual
carriageway with a speed limit of 60 mph or less
Weaving section
the length of the carriageway between a successive merge or
lane gain and diverge or lane drop, where vehicles leaving the
mainline at the diverge or lane drop have to cross the paths of

Selection of grade separated junction form
Full grade separated junctions
2.1
Full grade separated junctions shall only be used on dual carriageways and motorways.
NOTE 1
Appendix A provides examples of typical full grade separated junction layouts.
NOTE 2
The transition between a dual carriageway and a single carriageway can be formed using a merge and
diverge as illustrated in Figure 2.1N2.
Figure 2.1N2 Dual carriageway to single carriageway transition
2.2
Where transitions between dual carriageway and single carriageways are at lane gain/lane drop grade
separated junctions (as illustrated in Figure 2.1N2), there shall be a minimum distance of 400 metres
between the end of the physical central reserve and the back of the merge nose.
NOTE
A distance of 400 metres allows for an appropriate sequence of lane gain warning traffic signs to be
accommodated prior to the merge.
2.3
The transitional section between a dual carriageway and a single carriageway at lane gain/lane drop
grade separated junctions shall include hard strips.
2.3.1
A merge forming part of a grade separated junction should not be located within 500 metres upstream
of a transition from a dual carriageway to a single carriageway, measured from the end of the merge
taper to the start of the lane reduction hatching.
2.3.2
Interchanges may be provided at the intersection of motorways and/or dual carriageways to provide
one or more free flow links to accommodate traffic flows that would normally exceed the capacity of
priority junctions, roundabouts and signal-controlled junctions.
NOTE
Appendix A provides examples of typical interchange layouts.
Compact grade separated junctions
2.4
Compact grade separated junctions shall not be used on motorways.
2.4.1
Compact grade separated junctions should not be used on dual- and single-carriageway roads when
mainline flows are above 30,000 AADT.
2.5
On single carriageways, compact grade separated junctions shall only be used where the junction
layout includes a section of physical central reserve on the mainline to prevent right turn movements.
NOTE
Compact grade separated junctions consist of left-in left-out priority junction(s), between the mainline
and connector road, designed in accordance with CD 123 [Ref 2.N] , and connector roads designed in
accordance with this document.

Full grade separated: merges and diverges
General
3.1
Offside merges and diverges shall not be provided at full grade separated junctions.
NOTE
Offside diverges do not include forks.
3.1.1
At a diverge, or as part of an interchange, the principal signed or through route should continue ahead
as the secondary route diverges on the left.

Ghost island width
3.7
The minimum width of a ghost island shall be 1.2 metres at a distance of 50 metres from the tip of the
ghost island head or tail.
NOTE 1
Ghost islands less than 1.2 metres in width cannot be marked with a chevron, and therefore 50 metres
keeps the unmarked section to a minimum.
NOTE 2
Ghost island layouts can require significant length and this needs to be reflected in land requirements.
Merges and diverges traffic flows
3.8
The mainline maximum vehicles per hour (vph) per lane shall be taken as:
1) 1,800 for motorways; and,
2) 1,600 for all-purpose roads.
NOTE
The flows for maximum vph per lane do not represent the maximum hourly throughputs that are
possible, but greater flows often results in decreasing levels of service and safety.

NOTE 1
As an example of how to use Figures 3.12a and 3.12b, if the merge flow is 2000 vph and the upstream
mainline flow is 4000 vph, this would give a Type E layout with 3 lanes upstream and 4 lanes
downstream.
NOTE 2
On Figures 3.12a and 3.12b, the # symbol indicates areas of uncertainty and the choice depends on the
upstream and downstream provision and the ability for the mainline to accept the flows from the merge.
NOTE 3
On Figures 3.12a and 3.12b, the ! symbol indicates that the minimum layout to be provided is:
1) Layout C for rural roads; or,
2) Layout A Option 2 for urban roads.

3.12.2
A merge layout that offers a higher level of capacity than the worst case peak flow may be provided, for
example Layout C instead of Layout A.
NOTE
A merge layout that offers less capacity than the worst case peak flow cannot be used, such as a
Layout C instead of Layout F.

3. Full grade separated: merges and diverges
NOTE 3
The merge layout lengths are measured along the projected nearside edge of the mainline
carriageway, with the exception of the overlap, reduction taper and the 50 metres and 3.75V
separations (Layouts A Option 2 and G Option 2 respectively), which are measured along the nearside
edge of the connector road.
3.21.1
On rural motorway mainlines, auxiliary lane lengths should be extended to 370 metres or greater where
merge and mainline traffic flows are both forecast to reach or exceed 85% of the maximum design
capacities given in Figure 3.12b for more than 1,000 hours per year.
3.21.2
On uphill gradients in excess of 2% and where the proportion of HGVs is greater than 10%, the
minimum auxiliary lane lengths given in Table 3.21 should be extended to allow merging traffic to match
mainline traffic speed.
NOTE
An extended auxiliary lane on a gradient in excess of 2% where there is a higher proportion of HGVs
can provide increased opportunity for merging vehicles to match their speed with mainline traffic.
3.22
For extended auxiliary lanes, or auxiliary lanes on crests, at least one sign indicating that the number of
traffic lanes reduces ahead shall be provided.
3.22.1
For extended auxiliary lanes, or auxiliary lanes on crests, more than one sign indicating that the number
of traffic lanes reduces ahead should be provided suitable to the length of auxiliary to be provided.
NOTE
Signs indicating that the number of traffic lanes reduces ahead are useful to drivers merging on
extended auxiliary lanes as they can mistake them for lane gains, and on crests because the end of the
auxiliary lane might not be be obvious.
Merge visibility
3.23
The connector road stopping sight distance (SSD) shall be provided along the length of the connector
road up to the back of nose with the SSD being available at any point along this length.
3.24
The mainline SSD shall be provided from the back of nose.
3.25
Obstructions to visibility between the connector road and mainline shall not occur along the full length
of the merge nose.
NOTE
Visibility across the merge nose is necessary to allow merging drivers to see vehicles on the mainline in
advance of merging.
Diverge
Diverge layout
3.26
For up to 2 lane diverges from the main carriageway, the adjusted hourly design flows for the worse
case peak flow (see Section 3, sub-section "Merge and diverge traffic flows") shall be inserted into
Figure 3.26a and Figure 3.26b to determine the minimum diverge layout to be provided.

mainline SSD is the more onerous. However, beyond the back of nose, when continuation of the
mainline SSD is not required, the connector road SSD becomes the more onerous, as illustrated on
Figure 3.35N. As an example, where the mainline SSD is 295 m and the connector road SSD is 160 m,
at a point 135 m behind the back of nose the connector road SSD starts to govern the design instead of
the mainline SSD.

Spacing greater than the minimum between successive merges and diverges may be provided to
accommodate signing and motorway signalling.
3.36.2
Diverges for left and right turning traffic at interchanges should be combined so that all turning traffic
leaves the mainline at one diverge, instead of multiple successive diverges from the mainline.
NOTE
Combining both diverging flows results in less complex layout that is easier to sign and reduces the
number of route choice made on the mainline.

Full grade separated: weaving and spacing
General
4.1
For all-purpose roads, the minimum length between a full grade separated junction and an at-grade
junction, service area and lay-by shall be:
1) 1 km for rural roads; and,
2) the minimum weaving section length as derived for urban roads.
NOTE
At-grade junctions include priority junctions, signal controlled junctions, roundabouts and direct
accesses.
4.2
A weaving section shall be assessed using the weaving section lanes calculation where successive full
grade separated junctions are spaced less than:
1) 3 km for rural motorways; and,
2) 2 km for rural all-purpose roads.
NOTE 1
An assessment of weaving is only required between closely spaced (less than 3 km for rural motorways
and 2 km for rural all-purpose roads) successive junctions where a merge is followed by a diverge.
NOTE 2
On motorways up to 5 lanes wide, merges and diverges tend not to interact where they are spaced
over 3 km apart.
NOTE 3
On all-purpose roads up to 3 lanes wide, merges and diverges tend not to interact where they are
spaced over 2 km apart.
NOTE 4
Weaving section lanes calculation is provided in Equation 4.7.
4.3
Motorway service areas accesses shall be treated as a junction for the purpose of weaving
assessments.

2) 1 km for all-purpose roads.
NOTE
Where the minimum weaving section length cannot be provided between two closely spaced grade
separated junctions, the need for a weaving section can be eliminated by the inclusion of link roads
between the junctions, as illustrated in Figure 4.5N.

Figure 4.6b Minimum weaving section length for urban roads based on design flows
NOTE 1
In Figure 4.6b, D is the maximum mainline flow (based on 1,800 vph per lane for motorways or 1,600
vph per lane for all-purpose roads) and V is the design speed of the mainline upstream of the weaving
section.
NOTE 2
For urban roads, the design flows are adjusted for uphill gradients and the presence of HGVs by using
Table 3.9a.
NOTE 3
Refer to Fig 4.7N5 for calculating QW1 + QW2.
NOTE 4
When determining the appropriate spacing between successive merges and diverges, it is necessary to
consider whether the spacing is sufficient to accommodate the necessary advance directional signage.
Weaving section lanes calculation

NOTE 1
The principle of the weaving section lanes calculation is that the weaving length is fixed based on road
type and the carriageway width is calculated from the lane formula. The purpose of this is to establish
the need for the addition of one or two auxiliary lanes.
NOTE 2
For the purpose of the calculation the 'available weaving length' is never less than the 'minimum
weaving length'.
NOTE 3
The purpose of calculating lanes for weaving sections is to determine whether any additional lanes are
needed over and above those provided for in Figures 3.12a, 3.12b. 3.26a and 3.26b.
NOTE 4
For weaving sections on motorways and dual carriageway roads, design flows are calculated as
indicated in Section 3.

On link roads the lower design speed in Table 5.4 should only be used where an appropriate mandatory
or advisory speed limit is signed.
5.5
A slip road longer than 0.75 km shall be designed as an interchange link.
5.6
Any transition curves at locations where the design speed changes shall be designed to the higher
design speed value.
5.7
On connector roads linking to motorways the longitudinal gradient shall not exceed 6%.
5.7.1
Diverge and merge slip roads should be on uphill and downhill gradients respectively.
NOTE
Uphill diverges help diverging traffic reduce their speeds on the approach to the end of the slip road
and downhill merges help merging traffic accelerate to the mainline speed.
5.8
Connector roads shall include a near straight at the back of nose, at least equal in length to the nose.
NOTE 1
Nose lengths are given in Table 3.21 and Table 3.31 for merges and diverges, respectively.

NOTE
A clear view across the extent of the loop ensures that drivers are able to perceive the whole of the
loop layout on their approach to it and adjust their speed accordingly.

For loops, where a vehicle restraint system obstructs the view to the 0.26 metre object height, a low
object height of 1.05 m shall be used.

Straight sections longer than the 100m within the compact connector road shall not be used, except
where they form the connector road linking two minor roads across the mainline (as illustrated on
Figure 5.24.1Nb).
NOTE
The inclusion of long straight sections can lead to increased speed of vehicles through the compact
connector road.
5.22.1
Transition curves may be omitted on compact connector roads due to their low speed nature.
5.22.2
The design of a compact grade separated junction should avoid rapid changes in crossfall (through the
combined effect of the gradient and superelevation), as this can result in sudden shifts in high loads.
NOTE
The geometric layout of the compact connector road requires successive application and removal of

Diamond
A diamond layout includes slip roads leading to/from two staggered priority junctions. The advantages
of this layout are minimised land from certain quadrants of the junction, conventional slip roads (rather
than loops, which are necessary with half-cloverleaf layouts) and the requirement for only one bridge.
The disadvantage is that there are a number of conflict points on the minor road resulting from the
staggered junctions. It is also necessary to evaluate the risk of road users turning into an off-slip from
the minor road when considering a diamond layout.
Due to the staggered priority junctions, diamond layouts are unsuitable to cater for high mainline
merging and diverging flows and can also be unsuitable where there are high ahead flows on the minor
road.
Figure A.1 and Figure A.2 illustrate a diamond layout and a half-diamond layout and the traffic flow
movements they cater for.

Half-cloverleaf
A half-cloverleaf layout includes 2-way slip roads leading to/from two priority junctions on the minor
road. They can be useful at locations where it is not practical to provide slip roads in all four quadrants
of the junction.
An advantage of a half-cloverleaf layout is that they include less conflict points compared to a diamond
layout; however, a higher concentration of the turning movements occurring at the same point. A
disadvantage of half-cloverleaf layouts is that they necessitate greater slip road curvature and loops
compared to diamond layouts.
A half-cloverleaf layout caters for similar flow levels to a diamond layout and they are therefore
unsuitable for high mainline merging and diverging flows. They can also be unsuitable where there are
high ahead flows on the minor road.
Figure A.3 and Figure A.4 illustrate half-cloverleaf layouts with the slip roads provided in alternative
quadrants and the traffic flow movements they cater for.

Dumbbell roundabout
A dumbbell roundabout layout includes slip roads leading to/from two roundabouts. In relation to traffic
flow capacity, a dumbbell roundabout layout can be considered an intermediate between the
diamond/half-cloverleaf and the two bridge roundabout layouts.
The dumb-bell roundabout has the advantage of requiring less land than both the diamond and the two
bridge roundabout layouts. It also requires only one bridge.
It is important to ensure that the link road between the two roundabouts can provide queuing storage
capacity otherwise queuing could extend back onto the roundabouts.

Two-bridge roundabout
The most common grade separated junction layout is the the two-bridge roundabout. They provide
greater traffic flow capacity than the dumbbell roundabout layout and are less complex from a road user
perspective. They do however require two bridges and have a greater footprint.
Requirements and advice on the geometric design of the roundabout elements of this layout are
provided in CD 116 [Ref 3.I] .

Interchanges
A5.1
4-way, 3-level interchange
Where two major roads cross, a 3-level arrangement with a roundabout can be provided as an
alternative to a full interchange where volumes of turning traffic allow. Its advantages are that both the
overall land take and the carriageway area are reduced when compared to a full interchange with
entirely free flow link roads.
The disadvantages are that this layout requires a relatively high number of structures and if the turning
movements exceed capacity, operational problems such as queuing on the roundabout entries can
occur. If queuing does become a problem, segregated left-turn lanes and restricted circulatory
carriageway width could be provided, or signalisation if the aforementioned would not suffice.

A5.2
4-way, 2-level 'cyclic' interchange
A 2-level 'cyclic' interchange utilises reverse curves. The land take is extensive however and it requires
a relatively high number of structures. One particular disadvantage is that it requires separate diverge
points for left and right movements from both mainlines, which can be complex to sign. The illustration
in Figure A.8 shows two successive diverges off and one merge on to the mainline. A variant of this
uses one diverge and two merges but the distance between the merges needs to be as great as
possible to avoid potential conflicts. One principal connection on the mainline for the diverge, and one
for the merge, is the preferred option with the final route selection occurring on the slip road as this
reduces weaving on the mainline.

4-way, 4-level interchange
A 4 level interchange layout has the advantages of reduced land take, absence of loops and a low
number of structures; however, it can be visually intrusive due to its overall height.

A 4-way, 2-level interchange layout, as illustrated in Figure A.10, is an alternative to the 4-level option
shown in Figure A.8. It is less visually intrusive, but has a larger land take and larger carriageway area.
Another disadvantage is that it includes loops.

3-way, 2-level 'trumpet'
A 3-way, 2-level 'trumpet' interchange has 2-way slip roads. It is not suitable for motorway-to-motorway
links or generally high-speed approaches to the loop from the minor road. As the minor road could be of
a lesser standard to the major road, careful consideration is needed in relation to signing and preventing
unauthorised users (in the case of the major road being a motorway) from entering the major road.
A 3-way, 2-level 'trumpet' is illustrated in Figure A.11.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex (NAA) gives the National Highways-specific requirements and
additional relaxations relating to the geometric design of grade separated junctions for:
1) modifying existing motorways where motorway regulations apply (herein referred to as 'existing
motorways');
2) modifying existing all-purpose dual carriageways; and,
3) smart motorways.
The additional relaxations included in this NAA allow greater flexibility when dealing with the constraints
associated with enhancing elements of existing motorways and all-purpose dual carriageways in
England.
This National Application Annex is to be used in conjunction with CD 122 [Ref 1.N] and GD 301 [Ref
3.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

Modifying existing motorways
Scope
E/1.1
The requirements and advice in section E/1 shall only be used when modifying existing motorways,
with the exception of smart motorway and expressway schemes.
E/1.1.1
The parameters in section E/1 should only be used where it is not practicable to comply with the
requirements of CD 122 [Ref 1.N].
E/1.2
The parameters in section E/1 shall not be used for new motorway elements, e.g. the construction of a
new slip road.
Geometric parameters
Merge layouts (CD 122 3.12 and 3.21)
E/1.3
CD 122 3.12 shall be used to derive the appropriate merge layout; however, for existing motorways, the
derived merge layout can be amended by only one of the following options:
1) the road class in CD 122 Table 3.21 can be relaxed to 'rural all-purpose 120kph'; or,
2) the CD 122 layout can be substituted as described below:
a) Layout D can be used instead of Layout E1 and E2;
b) Layout B, A1 or A2 can be used instead of Layout C; and,
c) Layout A1 or A2 can be used instead of Layout B; or,
3) where no lane gains are to be introduced the CD 122 layout can be substituted as described below:
a) Layout B can be used instead of Layout D; and,
b) Layout C or Layout E3 (see Figure E/1.3) can be used instead of Layout E1 and E2.
