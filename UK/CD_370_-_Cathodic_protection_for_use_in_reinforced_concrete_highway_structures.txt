Anode
The part of a corrosion cell at which metal is lost into solution and electrons are released
into the metal. In a cathodic protection system, an anode is an electrode deliberately
introduced into the structure to prevent the original metal corroding.
Cathode
In a corrosion cell, the cathode is the metal surface that accepts electrons from the
anode and at which the electrons are consumed in a reaction with oxygen and water to
produce hydroxyl ions. In a cathodic protection system, the cathode is the steel being
protected.

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document sets out requirements, advice and considerations in addition to BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref
2.N] which shall be used for the design of cathodic protection (CP) to stop/halt corrosion of
reinforcement in reinforced concrete highway structures.
NOTE 1
CP is an electrochemical process involving the use of low voltage direct current (d.c.) electricity which
flows through the concrete and discharge on the reinforcement resulting in control of corrosion to
insignificantly low rates. The d.c. can be provided via an electrical power supply (termed impressed
current cathodic protection (ICCP)) or as a result of the reinforcement being connected to a metal
which corrodes in preference (termed galvanic anode cathodic protection).
NOTE 2
This document relates principally to reinforced concrete highway structures at risk of reinforcement
corrosion damage due to chloride contamination.
1.1.1
This document may also be used where the corrosion is due to other factors like carbonation.
1.1.2
This document provides guidance on particular cases where CP may not be appropriate.
1.2
This document sets out requirements, advice and considerations in addition to BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref
2.N] which shall be used for the design of CP for new structures exposed to chlorides (also known as
"cathodic prevention").
Implementation
1.3
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving design of CP for
stopping/halting corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete highway structures on the
Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 6.N].
Use of GG 101
1.4
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Introduction to cathodic protection
2.
Introduction to cathodic protection
2.1
This document shall be used in conjunction with CS 462 [Ref 8.N] to ensure that CP is only applied to
structures that have been assessed and where the causes of their deterioration have been determined.
2.2
This document shall be used in conjunction with CS 462 [Ref 8.N] so that CP along with associated
repair and/or strengthening works is the most appropriate technique to extend the life of the structure.
2.3
This document shall be used in conjunction with CS 462 [Ref 8.N] to ensure that the repaired/protected
structures are fit for purpose following the remediation works.
NOTE 1
This document covers only Principle 10 of BS EN 1504-9 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 2
CP can be used where chloride contamination is threatening or causing corrosion of reinforcement but
little or no physical damage has occurred, or where physical damage has occurred, but where it is not
economic or practical to remove physically sound chloride-contaminated concrete. Where CP is used,
sound concrete can be left undisturbed wherever possible.
NOTE 3
Further information on CP on steel in concrete is provided in Concrete Society CS TR73 [Ref 3.I].
2.4
All CP design and check as listed and detailed within this document shall meet the requirements of BS
EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] is the main international design and performance standard for CP of steel
in concrete, which is to be used for all CP design, installation, operation and assessment of CP on
highway structure.
2.5
The design and certification of an a.c. electrical supply, to power an ICCP system or any permanent
monitoring provision associated with a galvanic anode system, shall be in accordance with BS 7671
[Ref 9.N].
2.6
All CP personnel as listed and detailed within this document shall meet the requirements of BS EN ISO
15257 [Ref 3.N].
NOTE
BS EN ISO 15257 [Ref 3.N] is the main international standard for evaluating and certificating CP
personnel which is to be used for all personnel responsible for designing, installing and operating CP
on highway structures.
System selection and life
2.7
Satisfactory performance in accordance with BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] before maintenance for a CP
system shall be between 10 and 50 years.
2.7.1
Some impressed current anode systems, such as mixed metal oxide titanium (MMMO/Ti) mesh or
ribbon, may have a theoretical design life of up to 120 years.
2.7.2
Electrical power supply and monitoring systems may require replacement between 12 and 25 years.
2.7.3
Electrical power supply and monitoring systems should be designed so that replacement is
straightforward.
System monitoring and long term costs
2.8
A continuous and uninterrupted flow of d.c. electricity shall be supplied for the operation of any CP
system.
2.8.1
Such electricity should be provided by mains a.c. power which is converted to d.c. for ICCP, or via the
consumption of galvanic anodes for galvanic cathodic protection system.
2.9
The effects of CP on the steel/concrete potential resulting from electrochemical changes shall be
monitored and recorded.
NOTE
There is an ongoing cost associated with electrical power (for ICCP) and a cost of specialist monitoring,
communication (if remotely monitored), control and assessment (for all types of CP system). These
costs are to be incorporated into any life cycle cost analysis.

Assessment prior to cathodic protection
Life cycle cost, sustainability, environmental and other whole life benefits
3.1
CP shall be selected when it is the most effective solution in terms of whole life costs.
3.2
Assessment of the structure and its condition shall determine whether or not to apply CP, and the
extent to which CP is applied across the structure.
NOTE 1
By applying CP compared with the alternate long term repair option of removal and replacement of all
chloride contaminated concrete, the whole life cost can be lower. CP can also have whole life cost
benefits when there are difficult or disruptive access issues.
NOTE 2
CP can be an effective method of stopping corrosion for those structures that require a long residual life
after repair. Further cycles of repair patching are typically avoided as only maintenance of the anode
system, cabling and electronics are required.
3.2.1
CP can allow chloride contaminated but otherwise sound concrete to remain which should reduce the
cost of repairs and provide significant and lasting environmental and sustainability benefit.
NOTE 1
ICCP of reinforced concrete highway structures has been rigorously assessed and demonstrated to be
reliable and effective in stopping corrosion of reinforcing steel in chloride-contaminated concrete (for
further information including history of cathodic protection of reinforced concrete see CS TR73 [Ref 3.I]
and Technical Note 3 [Ref 2.I]).
NOTE 2
An ICCP system is capable of preventing reinforcement corrosion at any level of chloride contamination
(please refer to CS TR73 [Ref 3.I] and Technical Note 3 [Ref 2.I] for further information).
3.2.2
There should be significant cost savings for prestressed structures where it can not be possible to
remove all chloride contaminated concrete.
Comparison of cathodic protection with other techniques
3.3
Selection of repair methodology for corrosion damaged reinforced concrete shall be in accordance with
CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.3.1
Irrespective of the selected treatment to stop or repair corrosion related damage, it may be
advantageous to minimise future chloride contamination, where possible, by preventing ingress of
chloride laden water through deck waterproof liners or waterproof plug joint.
NOTE 1
Improvement to the provision or maintenance of drainage, replacement of expansion joints and
waterproofing can reduce future water ingress.
NOTE 2
For further details about advantages and limitation of the different treatment method to stop or repair
corrosion related damage, refer to CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
Evaluation
3.4
All available drawings and records shall be reviewed to assess the location, quantities, nature (e.g.
smooth, galvanised, epoxy coated, prestressed) and electrical continuity of the reinforcement.
3.5
The information on the available drawings and records shall be confirmed and supplemented as
necessary by site and laboratory tests as described in CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.6
In order to determine the most technically suitable and cost effective repair solution, the structural,
physical and electrochemical condition shall be determined in accordance with the guidelines provided
in CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.7
A structural integrity check shall be assessed in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.N] and CS 455 [Ref
11.N] to determine the current state of the structure in the deteriorated state, the impact of proposed
repair and remediation activities and the final state of the structure following remediation activities.

3. Assessment prior to cathodic protection
Site survey
3.8
All areas of the structure requiring CP shall be checked for delamination of the concrete cover or other
defects as detailed within CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.8.1
Cracks, honeycombing, or poor construction joints that permit significant water penetration should be
recorded.
3.8.2
Chloride content, in increments of depth through the cover zone and past the reinforcement should be
measured as described in CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.8.3
Carbonation depth measurements should also be conducted as described in CS 462 [Ref 8.N].
3.8.4
Concrete cover and reinforcement dimensions should be measured as described in CS 462 [Ref 8.N]
for correlation with chloride and carbonation measurements and to confirm quantities and locations of
reinforcement.
3.9
Existing repairs shall be checked to ensure they are in good condition and are compatible with CP, i.e.,
capable of passing current to the reinforcement.
3.9.1
Concrete resistivity testing may be conducted, where there is any doubt as to the compatibility of the
concrete or any repair in the concrete areas requiring cathodic protection.
3.10
The risk of electrical short circuits between anodes and reinforcement and with other steel for example,
tie wires shall be assessed.
3.11
The risk of possible stray-current interference shall be assessed and includes the risks to discontinuous
reinforcement, other metalwork, buried services or other structural elements.
3.12
Methods to alleviate stray-current interference, by for example continuity bonding or isolation of items
assessed at risk shall then be included in the cathodic protection design.
3.13
Loss of reinforcement section within the repair area, due to corrosion, shall be assessed in accordance
with CS 455 [Ref 11.N].
3.14
Following the assessment in accordance with CS 455 [Ref 11.N], necessary repairs and strengthening
works to the reinforcement shall be carried out prior to the installation of any cathodic protection system.
3.15
The availability of power supply and communication for the CP system shall be investigated by
conducting a services/utility search.
3.16
The extent of electrical continuity shall be determined in accordance with Clause 5.7 of BS EN ISO
12696 [Ref 2.N].
3.17
The method of electrical continuity verification shall be in accordance with the guidelines provided in
CS TR60 [Ref 4.I].
3.18
Potential (half-cell) surveys of representative areas, both damaged and undamaged, shall be carried
out in accordance with the guidelines provided in CS 462 [Ref 8.N] and CS TR60 [Ref 4.I].
3.19
For all structures which are to be protected with CP, a potential (half-cell) survey shall be completed for
the entire structure following electrical continuity testing/bonding and concrete repairs but prior to
anode installation activities.
3.20
All potential (half-cell) survey data shall be recorded and presented graphically for interpretation.
3.21
The information obtained after the potential survey shall be used to identify suitable locations for
permanent reference electrodes and identify the as-found natural potential prior to anode installation.
NOTE
This potential (half-cell) survey data can be used to evaluate the long term benefits of applied CP at the
end of system life or following a period of system interruption.
Cathodic protection of critical elements
3.22
Caution and attention to detail shall be required when the application of CP to critical or vulnerable
structural details such as prestressed, post-tensioned concrete hinges or half joints is considered to
meet the requirements of BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N].

CD 370 Revision 2
3. Assessment prior to cathodic protection
3.23
The existing condition and structural performance of critical or sensitive elements shall be assessed in
order to determine that stopping corrosion by the application of CP can result in continued safe
operation.
3.24
Critical or sensitive elements tend to have complex reinforcement details and as such, the design shall
include the assessment and distribution of current and the provision of performance monitoring devices.
3.25
All CP design for critical elements shall be subject to assessment and checking in accordance with CG
300 [Ref 10.N].
Additional requirements for cathodic protection
3.26
Any CP system shall require electrical continuity of the reinforcement.
NOTE 1
Fusion bonded epoxy coated reinforcement is difficult to protect by CP unless the reinforcement cage
has been made electrically continuous prior to coating. Any other coatings could have similar problems.
Metallic coatings on the reinforcement (e.g. galvanising) can change the requirements for cathodic
protection and require evaluation. In all cases, the level of protection by CP is limited due to normally
high resistance of coating.
NOTE 2
CP applied in accordance with the procedures described in BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] to reinforced
concrete has been demonstrated to have no adverse effects on the bond between the steel
reinforcement and the concrete.
3.27
Where alkali silica reaction/alkali aggregate reaction (ASR/AAR) is a principal cause of deterioration
and not reinforcement corrosion, CP shall not be used.
3.27.1
There is a theoretical risk that the alkali generated at the reinforcement by the cathodic reaction may
exacerbate any tendency for alkali silica reaction in the aggregates.
NOTE
CP designed and installed in accordance with BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] has been demonstrated to
have no influence on alkali silica reaction/alkali aggregate reaction. This has further been verified by
laboratory testing and site installations over the recent years.
3.28
The steel/concrete potential limits listed within BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] shall be adhered to.
NOTE 1
The application of CP changes the steel/concrete potential which is measured between an embedded
reference electrode and the steel.
NOTE 2
Where the potential becomes too negative, the cathodic reaction generates excessive hydrogen.
3.28.1
Steel with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of >550MPa may be sensitive to hydrogen embrittlement
resulting in hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) and, due to the high tensile loading of
prestressing members, failure can be catastrophic.
3.28.2
The risk of HISC is even more acute if there is any chloride contamination or corrosion of the
prestressed steel as corrosion pits or notches form initiation sites for failure due to increased stresses
and are more susceptible to hydrogen evolution as corrosion pits may contain low pH solutions.
3.29
Where carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) strengthening materials are installed or planned to be
installed within a repair and strengthening scheme in conjunction with CP, there shall be no electrical
connection between the CP system and the CFRP elements (that can detrimentally affect the bond
between CFRP and the parent concrete or impact the CP system performance).
3.30
CP design for elements containing coated reinforcement, prestressing or CFRP shall be subject to
assessment and checking in accordance with CG 300 [Ref 10.N].

Description of cathodic protection systems
General
4.1
Where it has been determined that CP is required this shall be by the use of ICCP unless it can be
assured at design stage that the use of galvanic anodes meets the performance criteria for cathodic
protection in Clause 8.6 a, b or c of BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N] for full design life of the system.
NOTE 1
Both impressed current and galvanic anode systems are discussed in this section although galvanic
anode systems have limited performance data available in UK applications to demonstrate the required
cathodic protection criteria in atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures.
NOTE 2
Corrosion occurs by the formation of anodes and cathodes on the reinforcement surface, as shown in
Figure 4.1N2 below. Corrosion occurs at the anode; a generally harmless reduction reaction occurs at
the cathode. By introducing an external anode and an electric current, the reinforcement is forced to
become cathodic and reduces corrosion to insignificant levels.
Figure 4.1N2 Anode and cathode formation on corroding reinforcing bar in concrete
Galvanic anode cathodic protection
4.2
Galvanic anode cathodic protection shall operate in the same principles as an ICCP, except that the
anode is a less noble (i.e. more active) metal than the steel to be protected and is consumed
preferentially, generating the cathodic protection current.
NOTE 1
Galvanic cathodic protection of buried or submerged reinforced concrete structures from anodes
installed into soil or water surrounding the concrete structures are well proven and have been
demonstrated to be reliable and effective. For example, galvanic anodes of magnesium (normally for
soil applications), zinc or aluminium alloys (normally for sea water applications), have a long and
proven record.
NOTE 2
Galvanic cathodic protection of atmospherically exposed structures from anodes installed onto or within
the parent concrete have greater applicability as part of a corrosion management system rather than for
provision of full cathodic protection as defined by the criteria of protection in Clause 8.6 of BS EN ISO

4. Description of cathodic protection systems
12696 [Ref 2.N]. There is not adequate data to demonstrate galvanic anodes are suitable to provide full
cathodic protection for atmospherically exposed concrete.
NOTE 3
The potential difference between anode and cathode is a function of the environment and the relative
electrode potentials of the anode and cathode materials. The current is a function of the potential
difference and the electrical resistance. Figure 4.2N3 below illustrates a galvanic system.
Figure 4.2N3 Schematic of a galvanic anode system
NOTE 4
As the voltage and current cannot generally be controlled, the level of protection cannot be guaranteed
and a low resistance environment is required.
NOTE 5
Some systems that operate long term as galvanic anode systems include an initial impressed current
charge period, typically using an external d.c. power supply. This is sometimes termed hybrid cathodic
protection.
NOTE 6
Where new anode systems are proposed, evidence is to be provided to demonstrate good
performance and a high probability of achieving the desired design life. This evidence includes
adequately researched and monitored accelerated laboratory testing and field trials. Field trials
incorporate a minimum of two UK winters and are to be applied to a civil engineering structure exposed
to conditions that are representative of the environment of the highway structure being considered as a
recipient of the new anode system.
Impressed current cathodic protection
4.3
ICCP system shall consist of an anode system, a d.c. power supply (typically a power supply
connected to an a.c. supply which is converted to d.c.) and monitoring probes, with associated wiring
and control circuitry.
4.4
ICCP system shall be designed to operate at a current density to the steel surface in the range of
2-20mA/m2.

CD 370 Revision 2
4. Description of cathodic protection systems
4.5
The suitable current density to be used shall be defined in the design based upon the exposure
conditions and extent of chloride contamination of the structure.
NOTE
An anode zone is an area that can be independently adjusted and monitored to provide cathodic
protection for the specified element. Typically each anode zone has a dedicated d.c. power source and
monitoring facilities which enable localised adjustment of current and voltage without affecting isolated
and adjacent anode zones.
Impressed current anode systems
4.6
Each structure shall be divided into anode zones to account for different levels of reinforcement,
different environments or different elements of the structure.
NOTE 1
The ICCP anode is a material that is consumed at a negligible or controlled rate by the anodic oxidation
reaction.
NOTE 2
One of the key decisions is the choice of anode. The alternatives are conductive coatings applied to
the concrete surface, mixed metal oxide coated titanium mesh or grid encapsulated within a concrete
overlay, conductive mortar and overlays, mixed metal oxide coated titanium ribbon in slots, or various
discrete anode materials embedded in holes drilled in the concrete. A schematic of an impressed
current system is shown in Figure 4.6N2 below.
Figure 4.6N2 Schematic of an ICCP on an atmospherically exposed reinforced
concrete structure
NOTE 3
Figure 4.6N2 above illustrates an atmospherically exposed concrete structure where anodes are
distributed across the concrete surface to pass current evenly to the reinforcing steel. For buried or
submerged concrete remote anodes can pass current through low-resistance soil or water. In this
application conventional anodes similar to those used for pipelines or submerged structures can be
employed, as shown in Figure 4.6N3 below, provided that consideration is given to the extra resistance
of the concrete.

Conductive coating anodes shall be applied to the surface of the concrete.
NOTE
Conductive coating anodes include a variety of formulations of carbon pigmented solvent or water
dispersed coatings, and, with a much smaller UK track record, thermal sprayed zinc.
4.8
Mixed metal oxide coated titanium mesh or ribbon anode systems shall be fixed to the surface of the
concrete and overlaid with a cementitious overlay which can be poured or pumped into shutters or
sprayed.
4.8.1
Anode ribbon may also be installed in purpose cut slots in the concrete.
4.9
Discrete anodes shall be installed in purpose drilled holes in the concrete. They are either:
1) mixed metal oxide coated titanium tubes;
2) mixed metal oxide coated titanium ribbon formed into cylinders;
3) conductive ceramic tubes in cementitious grout.
4.10
For any application, the CP design shall meet the requirements of BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N].

CD 370 Revision 2
4. Description of cathodic protection systems
NOTE
Corrosion Prevention Association Technical Note 12 [Ref 1.I] provides information on anode
performance and associated budget costs for different anode systems.
4.10.1
Where the foundations are either buried or immersed in sea or brackish water, cathodic protection
using buried or immersed anodes remote from the foundations may be applied.
NOTE 1
Impressed current anodes (high silicon cast iron or mixed metal oxide coated titanium), have a long
and proven record in the applications of cathodic protection to steel exposed to soils and waters.
NOTE 2
Typically these anode systems in soils or waters can be designed with an anticipated life in the range
20-40 years, but they are easier to replace than anodes installed in or on atmospherically exposed
concrete.
Impressed current power supplies
4.11
A permanent power supply shall be provided for any ICCP system.
NOTE 1
The direct current is to be be provided by an a.c. powered transformer-rectifier or equivalent power
unit, taking single phase a.c., transforming it to lower voltage and rectifying it to d.c. and outputting it at
typically 1-5 ampere, 2-24 volts to each independently operated anode zone.
NOTE 2
The electrical consumption of an ICCP system is low but is accounted for within the operation and
monitoring cost.
4.12
Where the power supply is locally not available, arrangements shall be made and allowed for in the
assessed system costs.
NOTE 1
Where a.c power is not available, there are emerging alternatives such as solar panels, thermal electric
generators (TEG) and wind generators.
NOTE 2
The solar and wind generators are used to charge batteries which in turn provide power to the CP
system. It is noted that the batteries have a fixed operational life based on the charge and discharge
cycle and can fail at end of life or due to lack of maintenance.
4.12.1
Street lighting may be a useful source of power to the ICCP system.
4.12.2
The power supply may be distributed across the structure and connected to a central control unit, or
clustered at a single access point.
NOTE
Distributed systems reduce the amount of cabling required, but future access to the outstations can be
complicated, compared with a single central access point. If communications to the outstations fail it
requires work to identify the cause and re-establish communication. The d.c. power supply can be
controlled:
1) manually;
2) remotely via a modem;
3) a combination of both.
Monitoring system
4.13
All CP systems shall be designed with full system monitoring in accordance with the requirements of
BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
Historically some galvanic systems have been installed without any monitoring facilities; this approach
has prevented accurate performance assessment of these systems and negated any potential benefits
associated with an evidence based management strategy.
4.14
The performance of CP systems (both galvanic and impressed current) shall be monitored by
measuring the effects of the cathodic protection current flow on:
1) steel/concrete potential measured with respect to reference electrodes installed in the concrete
adjacent to the steel;

4. Description of cathodic protection systems
2) steel/concrete potential measured with respect to reference electrodes or (less accurate) probes
installed in the concrete and the magnitude of potential decay with time after the cathodic protection
system is switched off.
4.15
Reference electrodes shall have a life expectancy of at least 20 years.
4.16
Reference electrodes or probes shall all be selected on the basis of documentary data from the
manufacturers or system suppliers to demonstrate their accuracy, their functional ability and their
longevity as required within the CP system.
NOTE 1
Suitable reference electrodes are:
1) silver/silver chloride/0.5M potassium chloride gel electrode (Ag/AgCl/0.5M KCl);
2) manganese/manganese dioxide/0.5M potassium hydroxide electrode (Mn/MnO2 /0.5M NaOH).
NOTE 2
Potential measuring probes (sometimes called pseudo electrodes) are less accurate but have a life
expectancy in excess of 20 years.
NOTE 3
Steel/concrete/reference electrode potential measurements taken with the cathodic protection current
switched "ON" will contain errors due to the voltage established by the current (I) flowing through the
resistive (R) concrete and films on the reinforcement. These are termed IR drop errors. To avoid these
errors the steel/concrete potential is measured "instant off" typically between 0.1 seconds and 0.5
seconds after switching "OFF" the cathodic protection current. The absolute value of the steel/concrete
potential is one of the criteria in BS EN ISO 12696 [Ref 2.N], as well as the decay from that value over
a period of 24 hours or longer with the cathodic protection current switched "OFF".
4.16.1
The voltage signals from the performance monitoring reference electrodes or potential decay probes
and their associated connections to the steel reinforcement may be data logged either locally or via a
modem interface for remote interrogation and data collection.
NOTE
The decision on the requirement for inclusion of remote monitoring and control is to be structure
specific. Considerations include the need to reduce exposure of personnel to hazards by reducing the
requirement for manual monitoring, the requirement to site equipment at high level to prevent
vandalism and other site specific issues.
4.17
Remotely controlled distributed d.c. power supplies shall incorporate remote monitoring and control as
an integrated part of their package.
NOTE
The larger multi-channelled systems in centralised enclosures can typically be provided with or without
remote monitoring.
4.18
Remotely controlled and/or remotely monitored cathodic protection equipment shall transmit their data
and be commanded with control instructions via communication networks.
NOTE 1
Communication networks can be hardwired telephone, wireless (mobile) telephone, e-mail or radio.
NOTE 2
Possible extensions of the CP system and associated communication network can be considered in
design and the relative merits of simple stand-alone systems or extensive networked systems can be
considered.
4.19
Additional reference electrodes shall be placed in the concrete at locations of particular structural
sensitivity, at representative locations of high reinforcement complexity or at locations of sensitivity to
excessive protection.
Other life determining factors
4.20
The d.c. cables for any CP system shall be suitable for embedding in concrete.
NOTE 1
Many cathodic protection systems, particularly those using mixed metal oxide coated titanium mesh or
grid anodes encased in cementitious overlays, encase all cabling within the concrete. Encasing the
cables within the concrete protects them from environmental damage and, in particular, vandalism.
NOTE 2
The anodic reaction products generate acidic conditions adjacent to the anodes, requiring careful
selection of sheath materials, particularly if the cable is in close proximity to the anode.

4. Description of cathodic protection systems
NOTE 3
Cabling systems installed on the external surfaces of highway structures in cable trays or similar cable
management systems have been vulnerable to vandalism and present maintenance problems.
4.21
Where it is required cables shall be buried in chases within the concrete for protection.
4.22
The connection between the copper wire and a titanium element of an anode shall be sealed to prevent
water ingress.
4.23
Power supplies, monitoring systems and their enclosures, located in external environment, shall not be
vulnerable to damage and to atmospheric corrosion.
4.23.1
The specification and location for these enclosures should aim to minimise the risks of vandalism and
mechanical damage.
4.23.2
The enclosure should provide environmental protection and impact against the worst case environment
and impact risk in accordance with BS EN 60529 [Ref 4.N] and BS EN 62262 [Ref 5.N].
4.23.3
The enclosure materials and/or corrosion protection treatment should provide a minimum of 20 years to
first maintenance in respect of atmospheric corrosion.
NOTE
It is reasonable to anticipate a minimum 20 year life before replacement of the electrical and electronic
systems that comprise the transformer-rectifiers and monitoring systems.
4.24
The location of the power and control equipment shall be selected to facilitate future access without the
need for elevated access or road closures if possible.
Cathodic protection of new or undamaged structures
4.25
A CP system applied to reinforcing steel in concrete that is not presently corroding shall be capable of
reducing future corrosion (this is sometimes referred to as 'cathodic prevention').
NOTE
The application of cathodic prevention at construction is beneficial for any structure where the exposure
conditions to chlorides mean that significant corrosion can occur during the design life of the structure.
This includes the tidal zones of marine highway support structures or tunnels where the external
ground water or estuarine conditions are saline.
4.25.1
A CP system may also be applied where new reinforced concrete elements are included into/onto old
chloride contaminated structures which have an increased risk of concentration of cell corrosion.
NOTE 1
Cathodic prevention has not been extensively used in the UK but it is increasingly used in regions with
severe durability problems. Examples include CP to structures near coastal areas, marine structures or
inaccessible elements of structures subjected to severe exposure conditions.
NOTE 2
Cathodic prevention, particularly if installed at the time of construction, can be significantly lower in cost
than cathodic protection installed during the service life of a structure.
4.25.2
Where chloride contamination due to exposure is sufficient to result in corrosion damage during the
design life of the structure, but does not presently justify the installation of a cathodic prevention system
at construction, a corrosion/durability monitoring system may be installed. This can give early warning
of the ingress of chlorides, and the ability to plan a cathodic prevention system installation or other
preventative maintenance.
4.26
The reinforcement shall be made electrically continuous to assist with installation of future corrosion
monitoring or cathodic protection.
4.26.1
A dedicated electrical connection point to the reinforcement may facilitate future electrochemical testing.

Appendix A. Impressed current systems versus galvanic an...
Appendix A. Impressed current systems versus galvanic anode systems
A1
A brief comparison of the two systems
The majority of cathodic protection systems applied to reinforced concrete internationally and,
particularly in the UK, are impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems where the electrical
d.c. power supply is a mains powered transformer-rectifier or similar power supply.
ICCP systems can be controlled to accommodate variations in exposure conditions and future chloride
contamination. The systems require an external power source, are more controllable and can often be
remote monitored and controlled. This can minimise the requirement to attend site for monitoring
providing health and safety benefits. The ICCP system has demonstrated that the reinforcement
corrosion can be arrested through its application.
Galvanic anode systems do not require an external power source, and so cannot be adjusted. They
typically do not come with remote monitoring systems. The life of the system is limited by resistivity of
the parent concrete, extent of contamination, which are factors that affect the consumption of the
anode, and other factors such as anode corrosion product formation.
Galvanic anode systems for atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete have had more limited use in
the UK and a number of trials are ongoing on the strategic highways network. Their use has generally
been to areas with low levels of chloride contamination and less critical structural areas. There is some
evidence of a positive impact of their use in these environments. However, it is considered that more
extensive performance data will be required for galvanic anode systems applied to atmospherically
exposed reinforced concrete in UK conditions before their use can be recommended for highway
structures in the UK beyond use as part of a corrosion management system.

Appendix B. Merits of cathodic protection
Appendix B. Merits of cathodic protection
B1
The main advantages of cathodic protection are:
1) undamaged chloride contaminated or carbonated concrete does not require replacement meaning
concrete repair costs are consequently minimised;
2) concrete breakout is minimised meaning temporary works such as structural propping during repair
will also be minimised;
3) concrete repair work and structural propping frequently requires lane closures and traffic control.
The CP minimises the need for these activities;
4) minimising concrete breakout reduces uncertainties over structural behaviour due to redistribution of
stress;
5) there is no need to cut behind the reinforcement to remove chlorides. In practice this can be
required, in part or whole, to ensure adequate bonding of the patch repair material;
6) the ability to not remove, dispose and replace chloride contaminated concrete negates the
associated environmental impact resulting from CO2 production generated during concrete removal,
concrete replacement and transportation of the waste;
7) cathodic protection controls corrosion for all the steel regardless of present or future chloride level or
extent of carbonation;
8) cathodic protection can be applied to specific elements, e.g., cross heads, or to entire structures;
9) the cathodic protection current controls corrosion in areas adjacent to concrete repairs that are
susceptible to incipient anode formation if only patch repairing were carried out;
10) regular monitoring of a cathodic protection system ensures that a continuous assessment of the
corrosion condition is available;
11) the integration of continuous corrosion condition monitoring can be an important benefit for critical
structures and for structures in severe exposure conditions.
