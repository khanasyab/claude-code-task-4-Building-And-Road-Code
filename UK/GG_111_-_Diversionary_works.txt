Introduction
Introduction
Background
The processes for taking measures necessary where apparatus owned by Undertakers is affected by
major works (Diversionary Works) have been established in HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N] (hereinafter
referred to as the CoP), complemented by the HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] (hereinafter referred to as
the Advice Note).
This document provides guidance on the steps to be taken under UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] when
diversionary works may be required to apparatus owned by an Undertaker. Diversionary works can
include the removal, alteration and protection of Undertakers' apparatus. Some advice is also given
where UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] is not applicable to the necessary diversionary works.
For all diversionary works, positive dialogue with all Undertakers will be instigated as early as possible
and maintained for the project's lifetime, in order to secure the efficient implementation of the necessary
work and the avoidance of unnecessary delay.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

GG 111 Version 1.0.0
1. Scope - principles and application (C1)
1.
Scope - principles and application (C1)
Application of NRWSA to diversionary works
1.1
Section 84 (England and Wales) and 143 (Scotland) of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] must be applied to
situations when apparatus in a street or road is or can be affected by Overseeing Organisation (OO)
works.
NOTE
The legislation empowers the Secretary of State (SoS) to issue or approve codes of practice giving
practical guidance on matters and steps to be taken by the OO and Undertaker to discharge their
respective duties. Practical guidance is provided in HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N] particularly with
regard to the agreement of necessary measures.
1.2
The four major guiding principles which are embodied in the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N] shall be
followed.
1.3
The diversionary works provisions of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] and its associated regulations shall be
applied when:
1)
the affected apparatus is in a maintainable highway (England and Wales) or public road
(Scotland); and,
2)
the works are major works, being either major highway works (in accordance with Section 86(3)
of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N](England and Wales)), major works for road purposes (in
accordance with Section 145(3) of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] (Scotland)) or major bridge works
(in accordance with section 88(2) of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] (England and Wales) and 147(2)
of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N](Scotland)).
NOTE 1
Where the apparatus affected is not laid in a maintainable highway or public road, but is in a greenfield
site, the appropriate legislation can be applied to effect the necessary diversionary works.
NOTE 2
The procedures for dealing with diversionary works under UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] can be applied to
greenfield sites. Sharing of costs in accordance with the Sharing of Cost Regulations does not apply. If
an Undertaker wishes to enhance the capability or increase the capacity of its apparatus, those costs
are to be borne by the Undertaker.
NOTE 3
Appendix A contains illustrated examples of when UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] and its associated
regulations apply to diversionary works for different types of OO schemes.
1.4
Whenever an OO scheme is affected by an Undertaker's apparatus, an audit trail shall be initiated and
maintained from initial inquiries through to final account settlement for any diversionary works,
recording the key stages in agreeing the measures and actions.
Procurement
1.5
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, the OO shall always retain the functions of ordering and
paying for the diversionary works.
1.5.1
The functions of the OO under UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]may be performed by agent authorities,
consultants, contractors or others acting as agents of the OO.
1.5.2
When an OO Agent is used, the OO should remain ultimately responsible for all functions and
authorisations of the highway or road authority.
1.5.3
Where an OO Agent has been appointed and functions are delegated to that Agent, the Undertaker
should be informed of the appointment of the Agent using either:
1)
standard letter NRSWA/C1.1 (see Appendix B) for individual schemes; or,
2)
standard letter NRSWA/C1.2 (see Appendix B) for term maintenance contracts.
NOTE
The OO uses various forms of contract to procure works, whether they be individual schemes or asset
maintenance. Each of these forms can impact upon the standard procedure contained in this standard.
In such cases, the procedure to be adopted can depend upon the form of procurement.

GG 111 Version 1.0.0
1. Scope - principles and application (C1)
1.5.4
The form of contract used to procure a scheme should be determined and the corresponding standard
letter used to inform Undertakers of the appointment of the Agent.
1.5.5
No stage of the process should be omitted until Undertakers have been consulted.
NOTE 1
Timescales for the submission of proposals, estimates and other information from Undertakers are
stated in the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N], extended where applicable and by agreement, depending
on the size or complexity of the scheme. Liaison can take place with Undertakers to establish realistic
timescales that will allow prompt submission.
NOTE 2
Design Build Finance and Operate (DBFO) contracts are unique, and it is therefore necessary to make
reference to the specific contract documents for clarification of the points made and to understand the
functions to be carried out by the OO and the DBFO Company.
1.5.6
Regular discussion should take place with the Undertakers throughout the planning and
implementation of the OO scheme and any associated diversionary works.

Scheme identification and preliminary inquiries (C2)
2.1
The processes undertaken for scheme identification and preliminary inquiries shall be in accordance
with the processes set out in HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N].
2.1.1
The advice set out in HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] for scheme identification and preliminary inquiries
processes should be followed.
2.1.2

2.1.3
All responses to preliminary inquiries and associated reports should be maintained as part of the audit
trail referred to in Section 1.
NOTE 1
It is important that Undertakers are made aware that the inquiry is on behalf of the OO in order that they
do not charge for the information.
NOTE 2
It is important that the audit trail contains details of the date of preliminary inquiries, to whom they were
sent, expected response dates, the information ultimately supplied in response to the inquiries, and any
likely special problems identified by any Undertaker.

Scheme options and budget estimates (C3)
Scheme options
3.1
The processes undertaken for scheme options and budget estimates shall be in accordance with the
processes set out in HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N].
3.1.1
The advice set out in HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] for scheme options and budget estimates
processes should be followed.
3.1.2
During preparation of engineering reports to consider the options being assessed by the scheme,
preliminary inquiries should be followed up and details submitted of the proposed scheme options to
the Undertakers using standard letter UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]/C3.1 (see Appendix B).
3.1.3
Pro forma NRSWA/C3.2 (see Appendix B) should be enclosed for completion by the Undertaker.
NOTE
It is not mandatory for the Undertaker to complete the UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]/C3.2 pro forma.
3.1.4
Separate proposals and budget estimates should be requested for each alternative route identified.
3.1.5
Confirmation should be sought from the Undertaker that proposals and budget estimates (including
completed pro forma UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]/C3.2 or similar) include:
1)
confirmation that the submissions conform with the requirements of the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref
2.N]; and
2)
an outline of the proposed discussions with the Undertaker to review the draft scheme and
possible modifications thereto in order to ensure that the most economical solution is adopted.
3.2
Before preparation of the TAR, any significant issues in relation to the Undertaker's outline proposals
shall be assessed; in particular any high-risk critical items or issues and any possible need for advance
works (see Section 5).
Preferred route
3.3
Once the preferred route has been announced, and the scheme is likely to start within the following 10
years for major bridge works comprising replacement of the bridge or five years for other major works,
a section 85 (England and Wales) or 144 (Scotland) UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] notice shall be served
on all Undertakers known to be operating in the area.
3.3.1
The section 85 or 144 UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] notice should also include all side roads that are not
part of the OO network, if the major works are likely to affect Undertaker's apparatus located in those
streets or roads.
3.4
Section 85 or 144 notices shall be served using standard letter UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]/C2.2 (see
Appendix B).
3.4.1
Notices should be served accordingly and copies incorporated in the Register.
3.4.2
A designated person within the OO should be responsible for serving section 85 or 144 notices using
standard letter UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N]/C2.2 (see Appendix B).
NOTE
The details required to serve the notice include details of the extent of affected maintainable highway or
public road and the intended start date for the scheme.
3.4.3
Key decisions in relation to the proposed scheme and associated diversionary works should be fully
documented as part of the audit trail referred to in Section 1.
NOTE 1
The documents of the audit trail can include copies of all C3 budget estimates, the discussions and
decisions made in establishing the basis for the detailed scheme and supporting documentation to
support any decision to omit C4 estimate if agreed with the Undertaker. In cases where the C4 stage is
omitted, a specification for the necessary measures will be required at the C5 stage (see Section 5).
NOTE 2
As the scheme evolves, discussions with Undertakers on details of the scheme and proposed
diversionary works, along with possible alterations to both, can ensure optimal solutions in terms of time
and cost are adopted, including the provision of updates from the Undertaker of the budget estimates.

Any terms and conditions of contract or engagement accompanying the C4 estimate that are
inconsistent with the provisions of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N], have no legal force and should be
rejected.
NOTE
There is always a need to agree a specification and programme for the necessary measures.
4.1.6
Revised C4 detailed estimates should be obtained where further discussion with the Undertaker results
in modifications to the scheme.

Scheme commencement and advance orders (C5)
5.1
The processes undertaken for scheme commencement shall be in accordance with the processes set
out in the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N].
5.1.1
The advice set out in HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] for scheme commencement processes should be
followed.
5.1.2
Undertakers should be notified of commencement of the scheme using standard letter NRSWA/C5.1
(see Appendix B).
5.2
Unless specifically required any notification shall clearly state that the Undertaker does not proceed
with advance ordering of materials or commencement of any works.
5.2.1
Orders for advance works and materials should be issued using standard letter NRSWA/C5.1 (see
Appendix B) and an Official Works Order (pro forma NRSWA/C6.2).
5.2.2
Copies of scheme commencement notifications to, and responses from all Undertakers, and copies of
all advance orders and records justifying the placing of advance orders should be retained as part of
the audit trail referred to in Section 1.
NOTE 1
Materials with long delivery periods and potential advance preparatory work necessary to avoid delay
can be identified during consultations with the Undertaker at the C3 and C4 stages and measures
identified that can require action in advance of the main works.
NOTE 2
For certain schemes it can be desirable, within budget constraints, to carry out some or all diversionary
works in advance of the scheme commencing in order to minimise the interface between the
diversionary works and scheme construction. In such circumstances, consider the risks of committing
to the diversionary works prior to commencement of the OO scheme.
5.3
Where a contribution towards the allowable costs of the ordered work is sought from the Undertaker,
advance payments shall be agreed with the Undertaker in accordance with the Sharing of Costs of
Works Regulations as WSI 2005/1721 [Ref 8.N] UKSI 2000/3314 [Ref 7.N] SSI 2003/509 [Ref 6.N].
5.3.1
HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N] and HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] contain information on the sharing of
costs for diversionary works, which should be followed.
NOTE 1
Sharing of costs is at the volition of the OO and advance payment is optional. Where the OO does not
wish to obtain the 18% contribution from the Undertaker, no advance payment is required, with a single
payment of the total allowable costs being made following the completion of the works.
NOTE 2
There are certain situations which vary from the standard principle relating to the sharing of costs which
are covered in the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N].
NOTE 3
The Undertaker takes full account of betterment and deferment of renewal, including deductions for the
full value of recovered materials (including scrap), which can be realised during the diversionary work.
In certain circumstances, the assessment of betterment and deferment of renewal can be complex,
requiring specialist advice where appropriate.
NOTE 4
Where the provisions of UKPGA 1991/22 [Ref 4.N] apply to the ordered diversionary works, advance
payment can be considered to secure an 18% contribution from the Undertaker in accordance with the
standard cost sharing principle (see Section 1).
NOTE 5
Details of the financial principles and the construction of invoices can be found in the HAUC(UK) DW
COP [Ref 2.N].
5.3.2
Where it is agreed that the OO will carry out part of the diversionary works, any advance payment to
the Undertaker should be adjusted accordingly by deducting the estimated cost of the OO works from
82% of the total estimated cost of the works (including the OO works) before applying the 75%.

Invoicing and payment (C9)
9.1
The processes undertaken for invoicing and payment shall be in accordance with the processes set out
in the HAUC(UK) DW COP [Ref 2.N].
9.1.1
The advice set out in HAUC(UK) 2010/01 [Ref 1.N] for invoicing and payment processes should be
followed.
9.1.2
The final account should comply with the Recovery of Costs Regulations, the C4 detailed estimate or
the agreed C6 costs where these differ from the C4 estimate, and include deductions, cost sharing
where applicable, and provide that the allowable costs for the necessary measures comprise relevant
direct costs and associated overheads.
9.1.3
Where any information is incorrect or missing from the final account or where there is a need to verify
charges being made through an audit, the Undertaker should be advised promptly, and in any event no
later than 30 days after the invoice date, to avoid any claim from the Undertaker for late payment.
9.1.4
The final payment made should be based on an itemised invoice detailing all Allowable Costs of the

EXAMPLE A: OO scheme merges with existing maintainable highway/public
road – Diagram A (Figure A.1).
This example shows the construction of an OO scheme which merges into an existing maintainable
highway/public road containing an Undertaker's apparatus.
Having discussed all options, it is agreed that the Undertaker's apparatus in the existing maintainable
highway/public road needs to be diverted as a result of the OO scheme. The layout shown in Figure
A.1 indicates the agreed new route of the apparatus, diverting along the new scheme and reconnecting
to the existing apparatus at points appropriate to the new scheme alignment.
Where the OO scheme merges with the existing maintainable highway/public road, the reconstruction
is major highway works/major works for road purposes.
As the affected Undertaker's apparatus is in the existing maintainable highway/ public road and the OO
is undertaking major highway works/major works for road purposes, the provisions of NRSWA and the
Sharing of Costs of Works Regulations apply to the diversionary works.

EXAMPLE B: OO scheme crosses existing maintainable highway/public road
requiring a new overbridge with temporary diversion of the existing
maintainable highway/public road – Diagram B (Figure A.2).
This example shows an OO scheme crossing an existing maintainable highway/public road. The
existing maintainable highway/public road is to be vertically realigned to pass over the new scheme.
Scheme construction will require temporary diversion of the existing maintainable highway/public road,
which contains an Undertaker's apparatus.
Having discussed all options with the Undertaker, the agreed measures include the temporary diversion
of the Undertaker's apparatus to allow bridge construction and the permanent relocation of the
apparatus in the verge of the raised maintainable highway/public road crossing the bridge. Part of the
agreed measures will require work outside the boundary of the maintainable highway/public road.
The vertical realignment of the existing maintainable highway/public road involves major highway
works/major works for road purposes.
As the affected Undertaker's apparatus is in the existing maintainable highway/ public road and the OO
is undertaking major highway works/major works for road purposes, the provisions of NRSWA and the
Sharing of Costs of Works Regulations apply to the agreed necessary measures, being both the
temporary and permanent diversion of the apparatus, including any off-site works.

This example shows an OO scheme crossing an existing maintainable highway/public road with the
introduction of a new roundabout. The existing maintainable highway/public road is widened and
reconstructed to link to the roundabout. The Undertaker's apparatus is in the verge of the existing
maintainable highway/public road.
Having discussed all options with the Undertaker, the agreed measures shown in the diagram indicate
the new route of the apparatus diverted around the perimeter of the new roundabout.
The introduction of the new roundabout is major highway works/ major works for road purposes.
As the affected Undertaker's apparatus is in the existing maintainable highway/ public road and the OO
is undertaking major highway works/major works for road purposes, the provisions of NRSWA and the
Sharing of Costs of Works Regulations apply to the agreed diversionary works.

EXAMPLE D: OO scheme across open countryside – Diagram D (Figure A.4).
This example shows an OO scheme, through open country, crossing a gas pipeline and overhead
electricity cable.
Having discussed all options, it is agreed that the Undertakers' apparatus needs to be diverted as a
result of the OO scheme. The layout shown in the diagram indicates the agreed new routes of the
apparatus crossing the OO scheme at right angles before linking back to the original line.
The affected apparatus is not in a maintainable highway/public road. Therefore any diversionary works
do not fall under the provisions of NRSWA and the Sharing of Costs of Works Regulations do not apply.
The PS should establish the alternative legislation applying to the relocation of the apparatus (e.g. the
Town and Country Planning Act). Nevertheless, the PS should endeavour to apply the procedures in
this guidance when agreeing and arranging the necessary diversions, the OO accepting the reasonable
costs for the diversionary works.

Please provide preliminary details of the effects on your apparatus, indicating on one copy of the
enclosed plan or an alternative plan of suitable scale and quality, your existing apparatus and the
alterations proposed.
In addition, please identify any special requirements involved such as:
1)
items of equipment on long delivery and the need for advance ordering;
2)
interruption of supplies to consumers;
3)
disconnection of supplies to premises which are to be demolished;
4)
special wayleave agreements associated with the diversion of your apparatus;
5)
early access to sites for the construction of special structures such as sub-stations, pressure
regulation stations, etc.;
6)
planning consents or special ministerial consents; and
7)
any other high-risk critical items or issues.
Please also provide C3 Budget Estimates based on current rates, including all direct costs and
overheads likely to arise from the necessary measures in consequence of the proposed works. A pro
forma detailing the information required at this stage is attached to this letter for your completion.
Where apparatus is at substandard depth (i.e. within the bound layers of the road construction), we
should jointly consider whether there is justification for you to make a greater contribution to the cost of
diversionary works. An increased contribution would not be expected where you have already
accepted reduced depth as a result of previous highway improvement (see Measures Necessary
Where Apparatus Is Affected By Major Works (Diversionary Works) Code of Practice).
Detailed discussions between the [OO] and yourself and other undertakers, either separately or jointly,
will follow to consider any modifications to the scheme, which may assist in facilitating the programming
of the works and/or reducing the cost of the diversionary works.
These discussions will also help us to decide whether a C4 stage of the process is required.
When replying, please provide an indication of the possibility of an allowance for 'Deferment of the
Time for Renewal' based on the formula set out in Appendix E, and for 'Betterment' given in Appendix F
of the Measures Necessary Where Apparatus Is Affected By Major Works (Diversionary Works) Code
of Practice and 'Materials Recovered'.
Under the CoP, the requested information should be provided free of charge and normally within 20
working days. Please contact us at your earliest convenience if you are unable to provide the
information within this time.
Should the scheme proceed, formal orders and notice will be served in due course
If you require any further information, please contact our representative, [Insert name of OO Agent
representative] at the above address (Telephone No. [Insert OO Agent telephone number]).

Please provide preliminary details of the effects on your apparatus, indicating on one copy of the
enclosed plan or an alternative plan of suitable scale and quality, your existing apparatus and the
alterations proposed.
In addition, please identify any special requirements involved such as:
1)
items of equipment on long delivery and the need for advance ordering;
2)
interruption of supplies to consumers;
3)
disconnection of supplies to premises which are to be demolished;
4)
special wayleave agreements associated with the diversion of your apparatus;
5)
early access to sites for the construction of special structures such as sub-stations, pressure
regulation stations, etc.;
6)
planning consents or special ministerial consents; and
7)
any other high-risk critical items or issues.
Please also provide C3 Budget Estimates based on current rates, including all direct costs and
overheads likely to arise from the necessary measures in consequence of the proposed works. A pro
forma detailing the information required at this stage is attached to this letter for your completion.
Where apparatus is at substandard depth (i.e. within the bound layers of the road construction), we
should jointly consider whether there is justification for you to make a greater contribution to the cost of
diversionary works. An increased contribution would not be expected where you have already
accepted reduced depth as a result of previous highway improvement (see Measures Necessary
Where Apparatus Is Affected By Major Works (Diversionary Works) Code of Practice).
Detailed discussions between the [OO] and yourself and other undertakers, either separately or jointly,
will follow to consider any modifications to the scheme, which may assist in facilitating the programming
of the works and/or reducing the cost of the diversionary works.
These discussions will also help us to decide whether a C4 stage of the process is required.
When replying, please provide an indication of the possibility of an allowance for 'Deferment of the
Time for Renewal' based on the formula set out in Appendix E, and for 'Betterment' given in Appendix F
of the Measures Necessary Where Apparatus Is Affected By Major Works (Diversionary Works) Code
of Practice and 'Materials Recovered'.
Under the CoP, the requested information should be provided free of charge and normally within 20
working days. Please contact us at your earliest convenience if you are unable to provide the
information within this time.
Should the scheme proceed, formal orders and notice will be served in due course
If you require any further information, please contact our representative, [Insert name of OO Agent
