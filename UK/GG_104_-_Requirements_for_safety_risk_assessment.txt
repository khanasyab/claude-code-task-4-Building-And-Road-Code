GG 104 - ENAA Version 0.1.0
Introduction
Introduction
Background
National Highways has a Safety Management System (SMS) that reflects our commitment to safety.
GG 104 fulfils the requirement for a framework that covers the identification of hazards and the
associated safety risk assessment and mitigation process.
National Highways has a number of values and business imperatives to take into account when
developing, maintaining and operating the network. Compliance with this document will provide the
means to demonstrate that safety impacts have been assessed and included in transparent
multi-criteria decision making, that will show rigour and withstand scrutiny if challenged to protect the
business. Our aim is that no one should be harmed when travelling or working on the strategic road
network.
The approach set out in this document promotes a safety focus, allowing decision makers to balance
safety implications with other considerations.
Safety risk assessments support decision making. Safety risk decisions on the viability of activities to
be undertaken, including decisions to 'do nothing', need to be supported by a safety risk assessment.
The presumption that to do something is always necessary does not guarantee the optimal safety
outcome for everyone.
By providing a framework safety risk assessment process rather than a rigid process, the requirements
provide flexibility for safety risk assessments to be as simple or as complex as the activity being risk
assessed requires and can be applied to the many and varied activities undertaken across the
business or otherwise affecting it.
When an activity is initiated through problem identification, a safety risk assessment will help determine
the nature and extent of any safety risk and the most effective way to proceed to reach the optimal
safety outcome for everyone.
The requirements support safety risk assessments throughout the entire project life-cycle including:
1)
Option selection.
2)
The design and departure processes.
3)
All aspects for which the application of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations
2015 UKSI 2015/51 [Ref 5.I] is required.
4)
The handover into operations, and maintenance.
5)
For the continuing safe operation of completed schemes, as part of the strategic road network.
The requirements detail the need to document the scope of the safety risk assessment and any
evidence used in it. This is to assure that a thorough audit trail is provided and there is no ambiguity
around the decisions made.
The application of these requirements will assure that safety risk decisions are aligned with National
Highways objectives, policies, duties and responsibilities, and are demonstrably evidence-led and
transparent.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
The requirements and advice given in this document are provided on the basis that an appropriate
governance process is in place and the outputs of the safety risk assessment process and decisions
are used to assure it.
In this document the term so far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP) is used as in the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act ( UKPGA 1974/37 [Ref 1.N]).

Introduction
The Health and Safety Executive provides further advice on the evaluation and treatment of safety risks
and this can be used to supplement the advice provided in section E/3 of this document to guide
decision making in identifying and managing safety risks SFAIRP.
Safety-related systems are not fully responsible for controlling hazards. The breakdown of a
safety-related system only has the potential to be hazardous when combined with the failure of other
systems and/or human error. Such systems and their operation are required to be managed, and their
performance assured.

Activity/activities
The function(s) carried out by individuals or groups in meeting
National Highways obligations as a strategic highways
company appointed by the Secretary of State under section 1 of
the Infrastructure Act 2015 ( UKPGA 2015/07 [Ref 1.I]), or third
party functions.
Competence
The combination of training, skills, experience and knowledge
that a person has and their ability to apply them to perform a
task safely.
External party hazard
These are hazards to National Highways network users and
workers that result from activities outside our network. [Note:
Such activities may include cyber activities]
Governance
The processes for making, recording and implementing
decisions.
Hazard
A source of potential harm, loss or failure.
Rigour
The quality of being extremely thorough and careful.
Safety baseline
Level of safety against which the safety objectives are set and
measured.
Safety objective
A statement describing what, if any, contribution an activity will
deliver from a safety perspective.
Safety risk
The expected consequence of a specified hazard being realised
with the combination of the likelihood and expected severity of
the outcome.
NOTE: The safety risk consequence is usually a measure of
harm or loss associated with an activity.
Safety-related systems
Safety-related systems are those that are required to perform a
specific function or functions to manage safety. They are not
fully responsible for controlling hazards. The breakdown of a
safety-related system only has the potential to be hazardous
when combined with the failure of other systems and/or human
error. Such systems and their operation are required to be

E/1. Application of this document
E/1.
Application of this document
E/1.1
The approach set out in this document shall be applied to determine the level of complexity of any
activity that does or can have an impact on safety risk, either directly or indirectly. This applies to both
National Highways and any third party activity, including through the planning and development
process.
E/1.1.1
Activities that do or can have an impact on safety risk for any of the populations or sub-populations as
defined in table 1.4. include, but may not be limited to:
1)
planning, preparing, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and disposing of assets, and
third party activities (examples of direct influences on safety risk, with nothing or no-one in
between);
2)
revising National Highways requirements and advice documents and all procedures, policies and
strategies (examples of indirect influences on safety risk).
E/1.2
The approach set out in this document shall be applied to carry out safety risk assessments to support
departure applications.
E/1.3
The approach set out in this document shall be applied to establish the relative rigour of the safety risk
assessment.
NOTE
The degree of rigour required for a safety risk assessment is proportionate to how simple or complex
the activity being risk assessed is.
E/1.4
Populations shall be classified as shown in Table E/1.4.
Table E/1.4 Populations
Population
Classification
People directly employed by National Highways either permanently e.g. traffic
officers, or periodically e.g. those undertaking site visits; and people in a
contractual relationship with National Highways, including our national vehicle
recovery contract operatives, all workers engaged in traffic management
activities and incident support services, and any other activities such as persons
carrying out survey and inspection work.
Workers
All road users, including but not limited to the emergency services, equestrians,
cyclists and pedestrians, as well as those others who are at work but are not in a
contractual relationship with National Highways such as privately contracted
vehicle recovery and vehicle repair providers.
Users
'Other parties' includes any person or persons who could be affected by the
National Highways motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, but who are neither
using it, nor working on it e.g. living or working adjacent to the motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads, or using other transport networks that intersect with the
motorway and all-purpose trunk roads.
Other parties
E/1.5
This document shall be applicable throughout, and to all potential options for undertaking an activity.
Implementation
E/1.6
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all activities that do or may have an impact on safety
risk, either directly or indirectly, for all populations as defined in Table 1.4 and according to the
implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE 1
Throughout this document the framework for the safety risk assessment process has been illustrated
by a series of flowcharts which provide a visual representation of the requirements. The full flowchart
can be found in Appendix E/A.

Safety risk assessment process
E/2.1
The framework safety risk assessment process presented in Appendix E/A of this document shall be
followed throughout the safety risk assessment process.
NOTE 1
If anything changes that affects the activity or component part(s) of it, a review to check that whatever
has changed does not invalidate the safety risk assessment is necessary.
NOTE 2
The initial planning and preparation prior to undertaking the risk assessment is summarised in Figure
E/2.1N2.

E/2.2
The tasks required to carry out the safety risk assessment using the framework safety risk assessment
process presented in Appendix E/A shall be defined before beginning a safety risk assessment.
E/2.2.1
The author(s) should include evidence of their competence to undertake the safety risk assessment.
E/2.3
The tasks required to carry out the safety risk assessment shall be documented in accordance with the
governance arrangements for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
E/2.4
A safety risk assessment shall start by clearly defining and recording the question(s) that it is seeking to
address.
E/2.5
Where the safety risk of an activity has already been assessed, then a reasonable and proportionate
effort to review previous, relevant decision making shall be completed and reflected in the safety risk
assessment.

E/2.6
Where there are a number of alternative approaches to undertaking an activity, each of these
approaches, known as options, shall be the subject of a safety risk assessment.
E/2.6.1
Safety impacts of options should be informed by the outputs of the safety risk assessments.
Multi-criteria decision making shall take account of the safety impacts and shall be in accordance with
the governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
NOTE
Option preferences formed ahead of the safety risk assessment process evaluation stage can lead to
unconscious bias influencing the outcome of the safety risk assessment process.
Categorisation of the activity type
E/2.7
The safety governance of the activity shall be determined by categorisation of the activity type in
category A, B or C in accordance with Table 2.7.

Activities for which there is limited experience in National Highways but
there is experience and previous safety studies and data are available
elsewhere in the UK or internationally, including in different industries,
which is deemed sufficiently similar to the activity in question to be
deemed relevant.
Activities for which there is experience within National Highways but
that experience and previous safety studies and data that are available
are in a different application of the activity and some adaptation will be
required. There might also be local and site specific issues to take into
account that can affect the relevance of the available experience.

Table E/2.7 Categorisation of activity type (continued)
A
The activity is substantially or entirely within the scope of existing
standards, guidance, formal processes or procedures and applicable
legislation.
The activity requires minimal or no safety related departures from
standard or safety related changes to formal processes or procedures
(including any legislation).
The nature and type of a departure is the most important element in
determining the categorisation and so a single safety departure may
change this.
B
The activity is largely within the scope of existing standards, guidance,
formal processes or procedures. There can be some safety related
departures from standards needed and/or safety related changes to
formal processes or procedures.
The activity can need minor changes to existing legislation.
Whilst the number of safety departures from standards, formal
processes or procedures can affect the categorisation, the most
important element in determining this is the nature and type of the
departures.
Statutory and formal processes and procedures (including standards
and legislation).
Consideration of the applicability of current standards, formal
processes or procedures, guidance and legislation.
C
Activities that are not within the scope of existing standards, formal
processes or procedures and require new ones to be developed.
Activities for which significant departures from standards, formal
processes or procedures are required.
Activities which require significant changes to existing legislation or
new legislation to be written.
Whilst the number of safety departures from standards, formal
processes or procedures can affect the categorisation, the most
important element in determining this is the nature and type of the
departures. For example, a large number of safety departures that can
be addressed straightforwardly will have less impact on feature type
than a single safety departure that cannot and requires a detailed risk
assessment to support it.

overall activity categorisation as the lower
category type, the features that were identified
with the higher category type require a greater
rigour of analysis, assessment and evaluation,
as well as governance.
E/2.9
The results of the categorisation process, and the rationale for determining the individual activity
features and overall category, shall be documented and supporting evidence recorded, in accordance
with the governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
E/2.10
The results of the categorisation process shall be used to determine if a safety control review group is
to be established to approve the category type and accept the safety risk assessment process.
E/2.11

E/2. Safety risk assessment process
NOTE
The section on safety risk governance provides guidance on establishing a safety control review group,
the purpose of the group, roles, responsibilities and escalation routes to the National Safety Control
Review Group (NSCRG).
E/2.12
An activity shall be referred to the NSCRG where any individual feature other than stakeholder impact
and interest is categorised as type C, and where the activity scale feature has the potential for an
increase to a type C categorisation.
E/2.13
Any NSCRG attendance shall be preceded by the establishment of an SCRG.
E/2.14
For activities categorised as type A, the categorisation shall be approved by the person responsible for
managing the activity.
Identification of affected populations
E/2.15
A safety risk assessment shall clearly identify all populations, prompted by the non-exhaustive list
described in Table E/1.4, and record how each is or can be affected by the activity.
NOTE
Sub-populations identified within an overall population as described in Table E/1.4 can be affected in
different ways because of their inherently different characteristics.
E/2.15.1
Where sub-populations to the populations described in Table E/1.4 with differing characteristics exist,
these should be assessed separately.
E/2.16
The identification of all affected populations shall be documented and supporting evidence recorded, in
accordance with the governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
Safety risk assessment scope
E/2.17
The purpose of the activity and how this will be undertaken shall be clearly defined within the scope of
the safety risk assessment.
E/2.18
What is included and what is excluded and all the populations affected by the activity and how it will be
undertaken shall be defined and recorded.
NOTE 1
The point of defining the scope of the safety risk assessment is to understand how the individual and
composite features of the activity work together to achieve the overall activity outcome.
NOTE 2
Defining the scope of the safety risk assessment supports subsequent safety risk assessment actions
by enabling those responsible for undertaking them to understand how individual features contribute to
the achievement of the activity.
E/2.19
The scope of the safety risk assessment shall be documented and supporting evidence recorded, in
accordance with the governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
Safety baselines and safety objectives
E/2.20
A safety baseline and safety objective relevant to the activity shall be defined, documented and
evidenced, in accordance with the governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is
undertaken.
E/2.21
Safety baselines and safety objectives shall include all populations.
E/2.22
Safety objectives for all populations shall always be to manage risk SFAIRP.
E/2.23
The safety baseline shall be established from the current or recent historic safety performance of the
activity.
E/2.23.1
The information sources or metrics used to establish the safety baseline and safety objective should be
the best available.
NOTE 1
There are a variety of information sources or metrics that can be used to establish the safety baseline
and safety objective depending on what the activity is.

E/2. Safety risk assessment process
NOTE 2
It is important to use the best available information sources or metrics and to understand any limitations
there are on what is chosen.
NOTE 3
If the activity is new, the information used to establish any safety baseline and safety objective can be
sourced from expert opinion.
E/2.24
When a safety improvement is not the primary purpose of the activity a safety objective shall still be set
for the populations affected.
E/2.24.1
Safety objectives may be set using individual or collective risk metrics.
E/2.25
Safety objectives shall be expressed in the same metric that is used to define the baseline.
NOTE 1
The metrics used do not have to be the same for every population in the safety risk assessment.
NOTE 2
The metric used does have to be the same for a population when evaluating any change from the
baseline as a result of the activity.
NOTE 3
Individual risk is calculated on the safety risk to a single person and is used to represent the statistical
risk of any individuals exposed to the risk.
NOTE 4
In terms of individual risk the commonest metric is the probability of a typical worker being killed or
injured during a year whilst undertaking their work.
NOTE 5
Collective risk is used to represent the statistical risk to a group of people, or a population, associated
with a particular activity.
NOTE 6
In terms of collective risk the commonest metric is the average number of fatalities per year that would
be expected to occur for a given activity.

E/3.2
All reasonably foreseeable hazards associated with an activity shall be identified.
NOTE
The identification of all reasonably foreseeable hazards includes understanding;
1)
who – might be affected by the hazard, which population(s);
2)
what – is the hazard;
3)
where – does the hazard originate on the road network, or is it an external party hazard, and/or is
it limited to specific surroundings or conditions;
4)
when – is the hazard limited to specific times;
5)
why – what is it about the population that means it is a hazard for them;
6)
how – does the hazard have potential to cause harm, loss or failure.

E/3. Safety risk assessment
E/3.3
All steps of hazard identification shall be documented and supporting evidence recorded in accordance
with the governance procedures for the business areas.
Hazard analysis
E/3.4
The identified hazards shall be analysed to understand the resulting safety risks and all reasonably
foreseeable consequences if those risks are realised.
NOTE 1
A simple test of effective hazard, risk and consequence identification is if they can be described in this
way: "because of <insert hazard here> <the risk> might occur which would lead to <insert possible
events here>".
NOTE 2
Hazards do not only occur in isolation so it is important to assess the impact of both single and
combined hazards.
Analysis of safety risk
E/3.5
The level of detail for any safety risk analyses shall be proportionate to the safety risks being assessed
and the activity type categorisation.
E/3.5.1
The analysis of the safety risks for each population should include an assessment of the likelihood of
the risk being realised and the most common potential severity of the consequences.
NOTE
Risks do not only occur in isolation so it is important to assess the impact of both single and combined
risks.
E/3.5.2
The analysis of the safety risks for each population may use a range of evidence sources, including:
1)
quantitative data;
2)
qualitative data including:
a)
previous experience;
b)
expert opinion;
c)
stakeholder input;
d)
research;
3)
combination of quantitative and qualitative data.
E/3.6
A qualitative, well-reasoned argument shall be used to justify decisions, supported by the best available
data.
E/3.6.1
Values for likelihood and severity of outcomes may be assigned to qualitative data for the purposes of
assessment (see Appendix E/C).
NOTE
Applying numbers to a largely qualitative assessment can create the impression that the assessment
has a higher degree of accuracy than it does, which could encourage inappropriate calculations, such
as percentage risk changes, to be made using numbers that are not supported by sufficient evidence.
Evaluation of safety risks
E/3.7
Outputs from safety risk analyses shall show the level of the safety risk associated with the activity.
E/3.8
Outputs from safety risk analyses shall be compared to the safety baseline and safety objectives set for
the activity.
E/3.9
During the normal and outside of the normal operation of motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, in
addition to evaluating the safety risk against the safety baseline and safety objective, safety risk must
be evaluated against the SFAIRP criteria for each affected population [Ref 3.9N2].
NOTE 1
The term normal operation is used to describe when the use of the road is not constrained by National
Highways implementing planned roadworks and includes instances when emergency traffic
management is deployed.
NOTE 2
The term outside of normal operation is used to describe when the use of the road is constrained by
National Highways implementing roadworks.

The evaluation of the safety risk analyses and any decisions on whether a measure meets the SFAIRP

procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
E/3.11
Escalation to and acceptance by the senior responsible owner for the activity shall be specifically
required for an outcome of the safety risk assessment evaluation that identifies an increase in residual
safety risk for a hazard, population, or sub-population, in accordance with the governance procedures
for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
Safety risk treatments
E/3.12
Where the outcome of the safety risk assessment evaluation for an option being safety risk assessed is
within the list below, safety risk treatments shall be explored:
1)
it shows a safety risk disbenefit from the safety baseline;
2)
it does not meet the safety objective;
3)
it does not accord with SFAIRP.
NOTE 1
Safety risk treatments are implemented to reduce the likelihood of a risk being realised or lessen the
severity of the potential outcome. Safety risk treatments are also known as mitigations or control
measures.
NOTE 2
National Highways can, with suitable and sufficient justification, exercise discretion in deciding to
provide or omit safety risk treatments.
NOTE 3
Safety risk treatments that rely solely on road user compliance require careful consideration and
justification and are not advised; a combination of treatments are likely to be more successful in
achieving the safety objective and compliance with SFAIRP.
E/3.13
Safety risk treatments shall follow the ERIC hierarchy - Eliminate, Reduce, Isolate and Control for each
safety risk.
NOTE 1
The ideal option for a safety risk treatment is to eliminate the safety risk.
NOTE 2
Where the elimination of safety risks cannot be achieved or the costs to do so are grossly
disproportionate, treatment measures for reducing risk through substitution, isolation, or engineering
and administrative treatments, are assessed in turn.
E/3.13.1
To identify appropriate treatments, a justification may be required that measures benefits versus costs,
known as a benefit-cost ratio (BCR).
NOTE
A BCR for a safety risk treatment that is > 2 shows a good return on investment for what it costs and
can be promoted on safety grounds.
E/3.14
Gross disproportion cannot be defined by reference to a BCR alone. There is a sliding scale of
likelihood, severity and exposure to affected populations that must also be taken into account, which is
where professional judgement supported by appropriate risk analysis is key.
NOTE
For a low likelihood, high severity, high exposure scenario then a very low BCR could be assessed as
appropriate. i.e.: a BCR that is < 1.
E/3.14.1
Any safety risk treatment with a BCR between 1 and 2 may be considered alongside all other options.

E/3.14.2
It should be taken into account where a greater benefit can reasonably be achieved by allocation of the
cost of a safety treatment with a BCR between 1 and 2 elsewhere within the project or a wider
programme of works.
NOTE
The benefits in a BCR will generally be measured against a monetised value for a risk of death i.e.
value of preventing a fatality (VPF) (see TAG Unit 2.2.4 [Ref 7.I]); depending on the data available other
metrics such as FWIs, KSIs, PICs TAG Unit 2.1.5 [Ref 6.I]or incidents can also be used.
E/3.14.3
A decision to do nothing may be a valid one if it is the proper conclusion of the assessment process
outlined in this document.
E/3.14.4
The residual safety risk should be assessed for comparison to the safety baseline and the safety
objective for each safety risk treatment considered.
E/3.15
Safety risks for the activity shall be managed to optimise the safety risk benefits and deliver that which
is SFAIRP.
E/3.15.1
In maximising the safety risk benefit of the activity, the HSE-approved concept of trade-off may be
applied (in accordance with the HSE document 'R2P2 Reducing Risks and Protecting People' HSE
Reducing Risks [Ref 3.N].
E/3.15.2
In applying a trade-off, any safety risk disbenefit to a single population should be outweighed by a
safety risk benefit to one or all of the other populations, relevant to the hazard being managed.
E/3.16
Where a safety risk disbenefit occurs to one population to enable a decrease in risk exposure for
another population, the residual risk for the disbenefited population shall remain with that which is
tolerable.
NOTE 1
Tolerability of risk is based on the understanding that it is not possible to fully eradicate all risk
associated with every activity, and it acknowledges the relationship between the willingness to accept
risks to secure benefits.
NOTE 2
The concept of tolerability contains boundaries that describe risks as unacceptable, tolerable and
broadly acceptable; 'unacceptable' because the benefits secured do not warrant the risk being taken
and 'broadly acceptable' because the risk is so low that there is no discernible benefit from reducing it
further.
E/3.16.1
Transfer of a safety risk disbenefit should only occur between populations affected by the same hazard,
and where risks to all populations remain tolerable.
E/3.17
Individual sub-populations shall be identified that may be affected differently by a hazard so that their
safety risks are managed appropriately.
E/3.18
All risk treatment options considered and discarded shall be recorded within the safety risk assessment.

Safety risk governance
Ownership, approval and acceptance arrangements
E/5.1
Throughout the life cycle of an activity, ownership and accountabilities in relation to the safety risk
assessment process shall be clearly identified and documented, in accordance with the governance
procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
NOTE
Ownership can transfer during the whole life cycle of an activity. When this occurs, responsibility for
continuing to apply the appropriate approach to the safety risk assessment process also transfers to
the new owner.
E/5.2
Safety risk assessment process outputs and decisions for type B and C activities shall be consulted
upon before acceptance and approval can take place. This is necessary to gain a whole life
understanding of how the activity affects National Highways and to gain agreement from across
National Highways that it can be implemented safely. This will be activity-specific assessment, so that:
1)
all activities define the roles that are consulted to support the acceptance and approval process;
2)
acceptance and approval is undertaken by competent persons;
3)
acceptance and approval is recorded, in accordance with the governance procedures for the
business area in which the activity is undertaken; and
4)
the acceptance and approval process applies to any changes introduced to the activity and the
safety documentation after implementation and is recorded, in accordance with the governance
procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
Type A activities
E/5.3
The activity type categorisation and the safety risk assessment process shall be reviewed and agreed
by the activity manager. The activity manager's agreement is documented in accordance with the
governance procedures for the business area in which the activity is undertaken.
Type B activities
E/5.4
The activity type categorisation and the safety risk assessment process shall be referred to a safety
control review group (SCRG).
Type C activities
E/5.5
The activity type categorisation and the safety risk assessment process shall be referred to a SCRG
prior to the National Safety Control Review Group (NSCRG).
Safety Control Review Group (SCRG)
E/5.6
An SCRG shall be formed by the activity manager for any activity categorised as type B or C. The
SCRG is formed of competent representatives of those business areas who are involved in undertaking,
or affected by the activity at any stage in the development, implementation and adoption of the activity.
NOTE
An SCRG is formed for the purpose of consultation on, reviewing, and accepting of the activity and its
categorisation, as defined in the Management Arrangement of Safety Risk for National Highways
Activities document NSCRG & SCRG [Ref 2.I].
E/5.7
For activities with a categorisation accepted as type B, the SCRG shall consult on, review and accept
the safety risk assessment process. The SCRG agrees the outputs of the safety risk assessment
process and any decisions made within it.
E/5.8
For activities with a categorisation accepted as a type C, the SCRG shall review the categorisation and
submit it to the NSCRG to accept. If the NSCRG agrees the type C categorisation, the SCRG will
undertake the same role for consultation, review and agreement of safety risk assessment process
outputs and decisions made within it but it will submit all of these to the NSCRG for their acceptance.

E/5. Safety risk governance
E/5.9
An activity shall be referred to the NSCRG where any individual feature other than stakeholder impact
and interest is categorised as type C, and where the activity scale feature has the potential for an
increase to a type C categorisation.
National Safety Control Review Group (NSCRG)
E/5.10
NSCRG shall be convened for any activity categorised as type C.
NOTE
NSCRG is a standing committee with membership as defined in the Management Arrangement of
Safety Risk for National Highways Activities document NSCRG & SCRG [Ref 2.I]. The key objectives of
the NSCRG are to:
1)
provide direction on safety matters to activities, and provide assurance that statutory and
regulatory duties have been discharged by National Highways, as well as any opportunities for
continuous improvement.
2)
assure alignment of safety objectives with National Highways objectives and targets, including
those that are not safety related;
3)
act as a specialist advisory group providing support to the Chief Highways Engineer;
4)
review and advise on complex, unique or contentious safety issues arising on activities;
5)
review and advise on safety issues that have a national impact or have not arisen before;
6)
assure consistency of approach to managing safety across activities;
7)
provide advice for corrective actions to senior responsible owners; and
8)
inform the senior responsible owner where an activity is not working in accordance with National
Highways stated requirements for safety governance, and require the activity manager to provide
evidence of their assessment of safety risk.
E/5.11
The NSCRG shall make a determination of the acceptability of any proposed solutions on type C
referrals made by SCRGs and either:
1)
accept the proposed activity;
2)
refer back to the project team for further consideration; or
3)
escalate the activity to the Chief Highways Engineer should the NSCRG feel that the issue has
implications beyond its authority.
Approvals
E/5.12
Type A activities shall require no more than a 'business as usual' approach, and therefore will not
require any additional approvals beyond those required by the governance process of the business
area.
Type B activities
E/5.13
The SCRG shall decide whether or not to accept safety risk assessment outputs and decisions or will
comment on the safety implications. This will be documented in the minutes of the SCRG.
E/5.14
The SCRG shall have the authority of the senior managers who ultimately sign off the safety risk
assessment process outputs.
Type C activities
E/5.15
The NSCRG shall decide whether or not to accept safety risk assessment outputs and decisions or will
comment on the safety implications. This will be documented in the minutes of the NSCRG.

Framework safety risk
assessment process steps
Task
Description of activity
Reason for carrying out the activity
Type A project - Risk assessment.
Identify and document reasonably
foreseeable hazards associated with the
activity for all populations. Conduct
safety risk assessment.
Record details of any residual risks, and
provide clear guidance on how these will
be managed/monitored into the future.
Supports the identification and
documentation of the hazards that will
affect the activity; enabling them to be
appropriately safety risk assessed and
subsequently treated.
To assure any residual risks are handed
over to the appropriate owner within
National Highways for ongoing
management.
Type B project - Risk assessment.
As above, and conduct additional,
appropriate safety risk assessments.
Consider use of sensitivity analysis to
support safety risk assessments.
As above. Provides additional detail and
rigour to the safety risk assessments and
ensures that options are informed by risk
assessment.
Sensitivity analysis on risk scores will
help focus resources on areas where
significant safety improvements are
necessary.
Hazard identification and
analysis.
Analysis and evaluation of
safety risk.
Safety risk treatment.
Type C project - Risk assessment.
As above, and conduct additional hazard
analysis and appropriate safety risk
assessment for all populations which
may include:
Preliminary hazard analysis (PHA);
System hazard analysis (SHA);
Sub-system hazard analysis (SSHA);
Interface hazard analysis (IHA);
Operation and support hazard analysis
(OSHA)
Supports the identification of hazards
arising from various sources and
interfaces, enabling the activity to be
thoroughly risk assessed and
subsequent treatments proposed. The
management of these hazards will be
consolidated in a log of hazards.
Document the safety risk
assessment.
Document all safety risk assessment
tasks undertaken. Include evidence
showing that appropriate safety
objectives have been developed and
demonstrate how these objectives have
been achieved.
To demonstrate that the appropriate
level of safety management has been
undertaken to assess the expected
safety performance.

Framework safety risk
assessment process steps
Task
Description of activity
Reason for carrying out the activity
Update the safety risk
assessment.
Updating safety documentation.
Safety risk assessments are live
documents which are to be reviewed and
updated throughout the life of the activity.
If anything changes that affects the
activity or component part(s) of it, a
review to check that whatever has
changed does not invalidate the safety
risk assessment will be necessary.
Maintain documentation as a record of
status of the safety risk assessment and
records ongoing achievement of safety
objectives.
This activity demonstrates that the
activity still meets all of the necessary
safety requirements and that appropriate
safety risk management is continuing.
Assumption validation and
monitoring.
Define and document review scope
and timescales.
Verify that the activity has implemented
any identified safety requirements and
assure that all planned safety activities
have been adequately undertaken.
Validate assumptions and meeting safety
objectives. This will require post
operational monitoring.
If any activities have not been
completed, or have been completed but
not in accordance with the safety plan,
then this will be reported to the National
Highways project manager. Safety risk
treatments will be developed,
implemented and recorded.
To demonstrate that the safety
requirements have been actioned.
Validate that the activity design satisfies
its safety objectives.
It is important to make it clear what has
been done to treat issues where
activities have not been completed as
planned, or outcomes are not as
expected.
