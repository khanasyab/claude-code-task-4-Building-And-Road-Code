Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document details the maintenance requirements for buried concrete box structures.
Buried concrete box structures are often used as culverts and underpasses through highway
embankments in the UK. Most buried concrete box structures are performing well and have required
little in the way of maintenance. However, where defects are identified, and without proper
maintenance, the service life of the structure is likely to be reduced.
A number of documents for the assessment, inspection and maintenance of concrete structures have
been written for concrete bridge decks such as CS 459 [Ref 5.N], CS 455 [Ref 6.N], CS 450 [Ref 2.N]
and CS 470 [Ref 4.N]. Much of this information also applies to buried concrete box structures.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

2. Maintenance
2.
Maintenance
Routine maintenance
2.1
Routine maintenance shall be undertaken to maintain and prolong the working life of buried concrete
box structures.
2.2
The condition and cause of deterioration identified through an inspection of buried concrete box
structures (Ref. CS 432 [Ref 1.N]) shall be used to plan, cost and undertake effective maintenance
work.
NOTE
Regular maintenance can be more cost-effective than early replacement of a structure as the costs of
regular maintenance are usually significantly lower than the capital cost for replacement.
2.3
The following shall be addressed during routine maintenance:
1)
invert silting;
2)
blocked drainage, including pipes, weep holes and internal gullies;
3)
vandalism;
4)
cracking of mortar joints; and,
5)
perished joint seals.
2.4
Clearance of silt, debris or vegetation shall be carried out without damaging the structure.
NOTE 1
Clearance of silt, debris and other vegetation can be necessary in order to inspect the invert of the
structure.
NOTE 2
Silting of an invert commonly occurs in culverts built on waterlogged ground or where ﬂow rates are low.
NOTE 3
Drains can become blocked leading to a build up of hydrostatic pressure and possible breakdown of
the structure's waterproofing.
2.5
Damage due to vandalism shall be repaired where it is detrimental to the structure.
NOTE 1
Vandalism is usually a local hazard confined to structures with pedestrian access.
NOTE 2
Superficial damage to lights, fittings, and drainage and by fire are in most cases not structurally
significant but their early repair can prevent further deterioration.
2.5.1
Graffiti should be removed from concrete surfaces where:
1)
it is detrimental to the structure; and/or
2)
it is deemed an aesthetic issue.
NOTE
The effects of graffiti on unprotected concrete is commonly limited to being an aesthetic issue.
2.6
The method of removal of graffiti shall not cause damage to the concrete.
2.7
Mortar joints and joint seals which have cracked or perished shall be repaired or replaced.
NOTE
Deteriorated and damaged mortar joints and joints seals can lead to the ingress and egress of water or
effluent.
Remedial maintenance due to critical defects
2.8
Strengthening or replacement of a structure where critical defects have been identified shall be
undertaken where the adequacy cannot be demonstrated through an assessment.
NOTE 1
Critical defects are defects which raise concerns over the stability and safety of the structure.
NOTE 2
Carrying out a more detailed method of analysis of the structure can sometimes prevent unnecessary
expenditure on the strengthening or replacement of serviceable structures when the initial assessment
by calculation has shown the buried concrete box structure to have a critical defect.

2. Maintenance
2.9
Site constraints shall be evaluated to determine whether replacement is more cost effective than
undertaking extensive remedial works including:
1)
for culverts, the cost of temporarily diverting the watercourse;
2)
for underpasses and subways, the availability of alternative routes for vehicular and pedestrian
traffic; and,
3)
the potential traffic management requirements and resultant traffic delays.
NOTE 1
Extensive remedial works can involve the renewal of the soffit or waterproofing system, or
strengthening using a reinforced concrete saddle.
NOTE 2
Extensive remedial works can be necessary, particularly for older structures designed and constructed
to less onerous standards. Some of these older structures were constructed without contiguous
waterproofing systems.
NOTE 3
Traffic management and traffic delays can be substantial for structures on the trunk road and motorway
network. Relining the structure with, for example, a glass reinforced plastic liner can avoid significant
traffic management and statutory undertaker's costs.
2.10
Where critical defects are observed which results in the buried concrete box structure being classed as
an immediate risk structure, the structure shall be managed in accordance with CS 470 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
Tilting of a buried concrete box structure supporting a highway can be an indication of an immediate
risk structure.
Environmental considerations
2.11
Where maintenance works are proposed, the environmental impacts of the works shall also be
assessed and managed.
2.11.1
Where remedial maintenance works are proposed, the potential for improvements to the structure with
respect to the environment should be considered.
NOTE
Improvements to the structure can include the provision of aids to fish migration and mammal ledges.
2.11.2
Sacrificial linings should be provided where the integrity of structural concrete could be adversely
affected by deleterious environmental liquids.
NOTE
Deleterious environmental liquids can include urea, animal slurry and petrol and diesel fuels.
