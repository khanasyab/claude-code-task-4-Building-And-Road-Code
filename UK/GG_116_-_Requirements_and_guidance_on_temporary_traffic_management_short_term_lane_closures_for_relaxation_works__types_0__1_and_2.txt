116 Requirements and guidance on temporary

for relaxation works, types 0, 1 and 2
Revision 0
Summary
This National Application Annex contains the Highways England specific requirements for the
use of impact protection vehicles (IPVs) for short term closure (STC) of single lanes where
"relaxation scheme" road works criteria apply. This document also introduces optional alternative
temporary traffic management (TTM) techniques which reduces the requirement for traffic
management operatives to undertake live lane working.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
The techniques within this document have been developed to reduce health and safety risks
associated with activities traditionally undertaken using live lane working. Providing physical protection
to road workers and directing traffic safely around the works location using an impact protection vehicle
(IPV) using this short-term closure (STC) technique can significantly reduce road worker risk without
adversely affecting road user safety.
Research and on-road use has shown that the three STC techniques detailed in this document provide,
under relaxation conditions, adequate warning to road users that the lane is closed and provides a
substantial increase in safety for road workers. This is achieved by removing the requirement for road
workers to cross the live carriageway to undertake fixed, short-term responsive works which presents a
lower risk option when compared with live lane working. This is in part largely due to lower
consequence severity if an IPV were to be struck compared with a road worker.
The service provider should determine the most suitable temporary traffic management (TTM) for any
given situation, to minimise safety risks to road workers, and whilst managing safety risks to road users
to an acceptable or tolerable/ALARP level. This is in accordance with the general principles applied in
the Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 ( TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N]). This document builds upon the
guidance given in the TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N], interim advice regarding the use of IPVs and guidance
relating to relaxation scheme traffic management.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

Definition
As low as reasonably practicable
(ALARP)
Reasonably practicable involves weighing a risk against the
trouble, time and money needed to control it. Thus, ALARP
describes the level to which we expect to see workplace risks
controlled.
Impact protection vehicle (IPV)
A vehicle, in accordance with TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N]
Section O.5 fitted with appropriate signing and lorry mounted
crash cushion, which is used to provide protection to road
workers and guidance to road users.
Small-scale planned maintenance
activity
Works that are pre-planned and can be completed in a short
period of time; such works can typically be carried out either
by live lane working or involve carriageway crossings in
preference to using either a mobile lane closures or relaxation
scheme lane closures due to the scale of works involved.
STC type 0
A TTM technique that can be used for small scale planned
maintenance activity that can be completed in less than 5
minutes, using a stationary IPV in the live lane to protect the
workforce and direct traffic around the work location plus an
optional 'Workforce In Road Slow' warning sign.
STC type 1
A TTM technique that can be used to protect planned
maintenance activity that can be completed in less than 20
minutes, using a stationary IPV in the live lane to protect the
workforce and direct traffic around the work location with one
lane closed warning ('wicket') sign and a 'Workforce In Road
Slow' warning sign.
STC type 2
A TTM technique that can be used to protect planned
maintenance activity that can be completed in less than 45
minutes, using a stationary IPV in the live lane to protect the
workforce and direct traffic around the work location with two
lane closed warning ('wicket') signs.
Works vehicle
A vehicle being used for traffic authority purposes where the
vehicle is being used in connection with the execution of
works on the road and meets the conspicuity and
roof-mounted beacon in accordance with TSM Chapter 8 [Ref
6.N] Section O5.

E/1. Planning
E/1.
Planning
E/1.1
Before carrying out any work, all risks associated with the work activity shall be assessed and used to
select a method of work that results in risk that is ALARP for all parties affected.
E/1.2
A suitable and sufficient risk assessment must be undertaken and appropriately documented by a
competent person, who is responsible for planning and carrying out the work in accordance with
HASAWA 1974 c.37 [Ref 1.N], Section 2 and MHSWR 1999, Section 3 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
For the purpose of this document, 'suitable and sufficient risk assessment' is defined in GG 104 [Ref
3.N], which sets out the framework and approach for safety risk assessment to be applied when
undertaking any activity that does, or can have, an impact on safety on Highways England's motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads, either directly or indirectly.
E/1.2.1
As part of the risk based design, the use of the short-term closure technique should be assessed as a
potential mitigation measure for works of up to 45 minutes duration where the risk assessment
identifies the need to eliminate live lane working in a nearside or offside lane on a dual carriageway
under relaxation scheme conditions (in accordance with TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N] paragraph D/O1.6.3)
to achieve a risk level that is ALARP.
E/1.2.2
Where the short-term closure technique (STC) is assessed and determined to be unsuitable for use in
the situation being assessed, other alternatives to live lane working that would achieve a risk level that
is ALARP should be evaluated.
E/1.3
The STC technique shall only be used for the short-term lane closure of live lanes at distinct and
separate locations, with each closure planned individually.
E/1.3.1
Where STC is being assessed for use at a number of sites that are near to each other, the risk based
design should evaluate the risks of the use of STC against the use of other TTM techniques to achieve
a risk that is ALARP.
E/1.4
The principles within the Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 ( TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N]) shall be applied in
respect of the safety zone or minimum lateral clearance required when working within a short term
closure.
E/1.4.1
Where a safe lateral clearance cannot be achieved, other traffic management measures should be
assessed for their suitability and implemented accordingly.
E/1.5
Information that helps to ensure the safety of those involved with the use of the STC technique shall be
provided to those undertaking the STC and working within the closed lane(s) prior to commencement of
the works.

Traffic management
E/2.1
All STC type techniques shall only be used where risk assessment indicates their use results in a risk
that is ALARP for all parties affected.
E/2.1.1
Risk based planning for the use of STC should include contingency arrangements in case planned
work takes longer than anticipated, in order that STC duration are not exceeded.
E/2.2
For all STC type techniques, no more than one works vehicle shall be positioned downstream of the
IPV.
E/2.2.1
For all STC type techniques, the works vehicle should be positioned 75m +/- 25m downstream of the
IPV and both the works vehicle and the IPV display the correct signing to guide traffic safely past the
work location.
Short term closure - type 0
E/2.3
The STC type 0 technique shall only be used for works that require the closure to be in place for less
than 5 minutes (including any contingency time for completion of the works).

Where used, the optional 'workforce in road slow' sign ( TSRGD [Ref 5.N] S.I. No. 362 diagram
