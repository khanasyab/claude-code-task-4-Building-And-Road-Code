2. Designing for pavement maintenance of footway...
2.
Designing for pavement maintenance of footways and cycle tracks
2.1
Data collected from visual inspections shall be used to assess the condition of footways and cycle
tracks.
NOTE
Information on visual inspections is given in GS 801 [Ref 1.N].
2.2
The following shall be determined to inform the design for maintenance of footways and cycle tracks:
1)
surfacing type present;
2)
location, nature, extent and severity of each defect;
3)
probable cause of each defect;
4)
whether the defect is confined to the surface or extends deeper into the pavement structure;
5)
treatment options;
6)
headroom at structures, gantries and overhead lines; and,
7)
consequential impact on ancillary assets.
NOTE
Information on headroom is given in CD 143 [Ref 5.N] for pedestrians and CD 195 [Ref 4.N] for cyclists.
2.3
Where deterioration of the footway or cycle track is confined to the surface layers, or limited to
cracking, surface only maintenance treatments shall be used.
NOTE
Surface only maintenance includes replacement/repair/reinstatement of the surface layer, crack sealing
and/or pavement surface treatment.
2.4
Where deterioration extends deeper than the surface layer, or is structural, partial or full reconstruction
shall be designed in accordance with CD 239 [Ref 7.N] to rectify the deterioration.
NOTE
Structural deterioration refers to physical and functional degradation, which includes heave, settlement
and root growth.
2.4.1
Where deterioration includes loss of edge, details should be designed in accordance with CD 239 [Ref
7.N].
2.4.2
Where vehicle overrun is found to have contributed to the deterioration, then partial or full
reconstruction design should either:
1)
be selected for the vehicle loading category in accordance with CD 239 [Ref 7.N]; or,
2)
include measures to prevent motor traffic access in accordance with CD 195 [Ref 4.N].
2.5
Where inadequate or ineffective drainage is found to have contributed to the deterioration, then repair or
improvement of drainage shall be designed in accordance with CG 501 [Ref 3.N] and CD 524 [Ref 6.N].
2.6
Where geometry is found to have contributed to the deterioration, then improvement of geometry shall
be designed in accordance with CG 501 [Ref 3.N] and Inclusive Mobility [Ref 2.I].
Designing for maintenance of asphalt surfaced footways and cycle tracks
2.7
Bituminous materials and thicknesses for the maintenance of footways and cycle tracks shall be
selected from the options in CD 239 [Ref 7.N].
2.8
The following shall be detailed for slurry surfacing:
1)
minimum PSV;
2)
maximum AAV;
3)
colour;
4)
nominal layer thickness; and,
5)
performance category.
2.9
The options for crack sealing of bituminous layers for maintenance of asphalt surfaced footways and
cycle tracks shall be selected from CD 227 [Ref 2.N].

2. Designing for pavement maintenance of footway...
Designing for maintenance of concrete-surfaced footways and cycle tracks
2.10
The design of repairs to concrete surfaced footways and cycle tracks shall be in accordance with
design of surface-only maintenance for pavements (with a concrete surface) in CD 227 [Ref 2.N].
2.10.1
Bituminous mixtures may be used as a repair material for the full depth of the concrete footways and
cycle tracks, unless there is evidence of vehicle overrun causing deterioration.
2.11
The design of full depth repairs to concrete-surfaced footways and cycle tracks with pavement quality
concrete shall detail:
1)
concrete compressive strength class and requirements for air entrainment;
2)
joint spacing and types;
3)
surface finish; and,
4)
any joint sealing.
NOTE 1
Load transfer devices are typically not used in concrete footways and cycle tracks.
NOTE 2
Joints are not typically sealed in concrete footways and cycle tracks.
2.11.1
Expansion joints should be included where there is evidence of compression failures as a result of
thermal expansion of the concrete.
Designing for maintenance of modular surfaced footways
2.12
Modular paving materials for the maintenance of footways shall be selected from the options in CD 239
[Ref 7.N].
2.12.1
Where modular surfaced footways are to be repaired, intact paving units may be recovered and reused
within the repair.
2.13
Materials shall be identified to match existing modular paving on registered high amenity footways and
cycle tracks.
Designing for maintenance of tactile paving
2.14
The selection of tactile paving materials shall be in accordance with CD 239 [Ref 7.N].
Designing for maintenance of kerb units
2.15
The selection and placement of kerb units shall be in accordance with CD 239 [Ref 7.N].
