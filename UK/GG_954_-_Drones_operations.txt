Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document details requirements that govern the use of unmanned aerial systems, commonly
referred to as drones, for / on behalf of the Overseeing Organisation.
The Overseeing Organisations recognise the benefits that using drone platforms can offer, allowing
work to be undertaken in safer, smarter, and more efficient ways. With drones being more accessible
and widely used throughout the highways (and related) industries, it is critical to ensure their use is safe
for everyone.
Uncontrolled drones have the potential to damage infrastructure assets, distract road users, and disrupt
other safety-critical airborne and ground-based activities. Whilst all risks associated with their use
cannot be eliminated, these should be recognised, assessed, and mitigations and protections planned
and implemented.
Accordingly, this document contains requirements that apply to the use of drones, over and above
those defined by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.

UAS equipment
Selecting equipment
5.1
To minimise potential disruption and safety risk, drone equipment shall be selected according to the
following principles:
1)
reliability, additional safety features and redundancy are sufficient to ensure safe operation; and,
2)
size and weight to be minimised to limit distraction to others and potential impact should a
collision occur.
5.2
Drones must display the UAS Operator registration number as required by the CAA.
5.3
If fitted, the ADS-B transponder shall be switched on for all drone activities.
5.4
Drone equipment for each use-case must comply with the legislative requirements defined by the CAA,
specifically corresponding the drone equipment (weight, size, payload, flight type, etc.) to the
limitations of the relevant CAA operational (sub)category.
NOTE 1
Selecting suitable equipment is a factor for the SRA, and ensuring that equipment is appropriate for the
use-case will facilitate both health and safety requirements and ensure that the drone operation
delivers its intended outcomes.
NOTE 2
Drones manufactured prior to December 2020 are classed as legacy drones by the CAA. Legacy
drones can continue to operate normally until December 2023. After this date new CAA guidance will
come into place.
NOTE 3
Prior to December 2022 and subject to weight and/or other variables, a drone activity can fall into the
CAA operational subcategory A1, A2, A3 or Specific, and this will dictate the specific cases legacy
drones operate in without an operational authorisation. From the 1st January 2023 all new drones have
to meet a set of standards that dictate the open categories they can be flown in. Drones classed as C0
or C1 can be flown in the A1 sub-category, C2 can be flown in the A2 sub-category, whilst C3 and C4
can only fly in the A3 sub-category.

E/3.5.1
Activity Managers should access the DGH repository of information on previous drone activities in
support of their completion of the GG 104 [Ref 4.N] assessment for drone activity.
NOTE 1
A number of preliminary SRA's are available from the DGH, to inform a variety of drone activities and
classes, to assist completion of the required GG 104 [Ref 4.N] risk assessment. These can be used as
reference materials, but will require adapting to the drone operation as these do not evaluate the
specific operational environment or activities to be undertaken.
NOTE 2
An exemplar GG 104 [Ref 4.N] SRA and example template is available from the DGH via an internal
portal page to assist the Activity Manager in the compilation of their site-specific SRA.
NOTE 3
National Highways Activity Managers have access to an internal portal page providing pertinent
reference information for drone activities.
E/3.5.2
Activity Managers should direct enquiries through the DGH (drones@nationalhighways.co.uk).
E/3.6
The Activity Manager shall maintain and update the SRA throughout the activity lifespan.
Submitting SRA for review
E/3.7
The Activity Manager shall engage the following groups in an escalating sequence, according to the
SRA type category:
1)
Drone Governance Hub;
2)
Drone Safety Control Review Group; and,

E/3. Managing safety risk
Pre-activity information
E/3.19
Immediately before accepted drone activities are undertaken, the Activity Manager shall inform the
DGH, confirming the date and time of the activity.
NOTE
The SRA includes information on the dates and frequencies of flight (clause 3.8 item #4), however this
typically provides a range to work within. Due to the nature of drone operations, some flexibility is
required (such as to work around poor visibility or high winds).
Post-activity information
E/3.20
Once a drone activity has been undertaken, the Activity Manager shall report back to the DGH,
informing them of the completion and providing feedback documentation as requested.

drones in the vicinity of the network, and can be referenced by the DGH, Drone SCRG and NSCRG
during the SRA process.
Line of sight
E/4.7
All drone operations shall be limited to either:
1)
VLOS: those where direct unaided visual observation is maintained by the remote pilot at all
times, where operations do not exceed 500 m from the remote pilot; or,
2)
EVLOS: those where direct unaided visual observation is maintained by the remote pilot or the
unmanned aircraft observer at all times, where operations do not exceed 1500 m from the the
remote pilot or 500 m from an unmanned aircraft observer.
