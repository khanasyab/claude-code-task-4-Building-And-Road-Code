Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives requirements and advice on the structural review and assessment of highway
structures. Structural review is to be used to support decisions on whether highway structures are
required to undergo assessment. With the issue of BD 101/11, the following standards were withdrawn:
BD 34/90, BA 34/90, BD 46/92 and BD 50/92.
Road vehicles in the United Kingdom are categorised for regulatory purposes into three broad groups
as given below:
1) Vehicles complying with The Road Vehicles Construction and Use (C&U) Regulations SI 1986/1078
[Ref 12.N] and Authorised Weight (AW) Regulations SI 1998/3111 [Ref 11.N]. This group includes
cars, light goods vehicles, and rigid and articulated heavy goods vehicles up to a gross weight of 44
tonnes. These vehicles are not subject to permit and notification requirements. For convenience,
the term AW referred to hereinafter is to be taken to include C&U. The effects of these AW vehicles
are assessed in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 2.N].
2) Vehicles complying with The Road Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) General Order (STGO
Regulations) SI 2003/1998 [Ref 10.N] . This group includes vehicles that do not comply with the AW
Regulations such as those used for carrying or drawing abnormal indivisible loads. Vehicle
operators are required to provide notification of vehicle movements in accordance with STGO
Regulations. The effects of STGO vehicles are assessed in accordance with CS 458 [Ref 8.N].
3) Special order (SO) vehicles. This group includes vehicles that do not comply with the AW or STGO
Regulations and is covered by Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 [Ref 6.N] . Vehicle operators
are required to submit to the Overseeing Organisation an application for an individual SO
authorising the movement of an SO vehicle. In Northern Ireland the equivalent vehicles are covered
by Article 60 of the SI 1995 No. 2994 (NI 18) [Ref 9.N] Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.
The effects of SO vehicles are assessed in accordance with CS 458 [Ref 8.N].
Overseeing Organisations have undertaken comprehensive programmes of bridge assessment and
strengthening. The aim of these programmes was to ensure the bridge stock could safely carry AW
vehicles. However, for those bridges that could safely carry AW vehicles, the assessed HB capacity (for
STGO vehicles) was occasionally less than required. Also, studies have shown that the HB loading
model does not represent accurately the effects of real STGO and SO vehicles, and is particularly
onerous for structures with loaded lengths of less than 10m. Thus the concept of assessing for STGO
and SO vehicles was introduced by BD 86. This offers the benefit of attainment of higher load capacity
ratings, particularly for structures with loaded lengths of less than 10m. This may assist in avoiding the
need for costly and disruptive strengthening work. Although HB capacity is still used in some cases as
a comparator for determining some abnormal load routes, the intention is that use of HB ratings is to be
phased out (see CS 458 [Ref 8.N]).
Objectives
This document presents a system for structural review and assessment of structures as recommended
by "Management of Highway Structures – A Code of Practice" MHS CoP [Ref 4.N].
Structural review and, where necessary, assessment and strengthening, are on-going activities in the
management of highway structures, ensuring that the operational capacity available reflects the needs
of the network, including STGO and SO vehicle movements. This ensures that the capacities of
structures are kept up-to-date and reduce the risk of structural inadequacy due to ongoing
deterioration, accidental or other damage, changes in vehicle loading, and changes in design and
assessment standards.
Structural review and assessment contribute to route strategies, for example enabling identification of
the points of lowest capacity on a route and supporting decisions on route upgrades.
Structural review and assessment also contributes to maintenance strategies. For example, by
capturing the reserve factors of the bridge stock, and recording them in the Overseeing Organisations'

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for requirements and guidance on:
1) structural review – the method of establishing whether structures need to undergo assessment, and
setting priorities for assessment; and,
2) assessment procedures and reporting.
1.2
This document shall be applied to the following highway structures:
1) bridge, buried structure, subway, underpass, culvert and any other structure supporting the highway
and subject to applied vehicular traffic loading with clear span or internal diameter of 1.8m or greater
except that corrugated steel buried structures are included if they have spans of 0.9m or more;
2) earth retaining structures (as defined in CG 302 [Ref 1.N]) with an effective retained height of 1.5m
or greater, and subject to applied vehicular traffic loading; and,
3) reinforced/strengthened soil/fill structure with hard facings (as defined in CG 302 [Ref 1.N]) with an
effective retained height of 1.5m or greater, and subject to applied vehicular traffic loading.
1.3
Structures that have not been previously assessed, because they have either been designed to
standards which allow for current vehicle loading or they pose a low risk of failure due to current vehicle
loading, shall not be brought into the scope of structural review unless agreed by the Overseeing
Organisation.
NOTE
Details of the structures which were not included in assessment programmes and do not fall within the
scope of this document are:
1) bridges, culverts, buried structures used as under-passes, pedestrian subways and cattle creeps,
where these are of less than 1.8m span; multi-cell culverts where the cumulative span is 5m or less;
retaining walls of 1.5 metres height or less from finished ground level in front of the wall to the top of
the wall;
2) culverts and buried structures of 3m span or less with cover of 1 metre or more;
3) structures carrying accommodation roads and other non-public roads; and,
4) structures that have been certified as designed to carry at least 30 units of HB, or in the case of
walls, type HA surcharge or equivalent, unless suffering from a reduction in capacity as described in
the Terms and Definitions under 'SO vehicles, STGO vehicles and SV load models'.
1.3.1
This document may be applied to other highway structures, such as footbridges, as agreed by the
Overseeing Organisation.
Implementation
1.4
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the assessment, design,
construction, operation, management and maintenance of the Overseeing Organisations' motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 3.N].

2. The structural review and assessment process
2.
The structural review and assessment process
General
2.1
The structural review and assessment process shall comprise two stages:
1) the structural review, which determines the requirement for, and priority of, the second stage; and,
2) an assessment (or part assessment) in accordance with the relevant assessment document.
Structural review
2.2
Structures shall undergo a structural review on a 12 year cycle, to align with alternate principal
inspections (PIs).
2.2.1
Where there are reasons for not undertaking a structural review of a structure which is within the scope
of this document, or for varying the 12 yearly intervals, these should be recorded and presented to the
Overseeing Organisation for agreement.
NOTE
All eligible structures are to undergo their first structural review within 12 years of the date of publication
of this document, and receive a further structural review every 12 years thereafter.
2.2.2
Where the period between PIs has been increased by a risk assessment, and agreed with the
Technical Approval Authority (TAA), the structural review should match this cycle, e.g if the period
between PIs has been increased to 8 years then subsequent structural reviews can be undertaken at
16 year intervals.
NOTE
As an increased period between PIs reflects the risks posed by a structure then the period between
structural reviews can be similarly extended.
2.3
An annual programme of structural reviews shall be identified to smooth the workload associated with
this activity.
2.3.1
The programme for structural reviews should be guided by operational needs and the PI programme.
NOTE
Structures which have defects that are likely to affect their design or assessed capacity; and structures
which have, or are going to have, changes to their imposed loading can be identified as high priorities
for structural review and would appear early in the programme.
2.3.2
The structural review should include the following criteria in a risk appraisal which provides an
evaluation of the consequences of a failure to identify a shortcoming in the carrying capacity of the
structure:
1) load capacity – this can can be from an assessment, original design loading, or assumption on
design loading based on year of construction;
2) the presence, or otherwise of interim ( CS 470 [Ref 5.N]) measures;
3) the current condition of the structure, from a recent PI;
4) the accessibility of critical elements of the structure to inspection;
5) the presence, or otherwise of a monitoring regime for the structure;
6) any changes in condition that have occurred since the assessment (if assessed) or design, that are
likely to detrimentally affect the load capacity;
7) any increase in loading that has occurred since the assessment (if assessed) or design;
8) any proposed increase in loading; and,
9) the route carried and obstacle crossed.
2.4
The structural review shall be carried out with reference to the assessment documents current at the
time of the review.
NOTE
The reviewer can evaluate any differences between the current assessment standards and the
standards used for previous assessment or design, and make a recommendation as to whether those
differences are significant to the current loading regime on the structure.

CS 451 Revision 0
2. The structural review and assessment process
2.4.1
Any obvious inaccuracies noted in the existing assessment calculations may be identified in the
structural review.
NOTE
Unless otherwise specified, the structural review is not expected to verify the accuracy of existing
assessment calculations.
2.4.2
Structures with a structural review confirming they have been designed or have previously been
assessed and their capacity recorded as 40 tonne assessment live loading (ALL) and 45 units of HB
with no significant change in condition may, if necessary and with the agreement of the TAA, have their
corresponding reserve factors for special vehicle (SV) load models ascertained using the conversion
charts given in CS 458 [Ref 8.N] (subject to the stated limitations).
NOTE
It is intended that over time vehicle ratings are to replace HB ratings as an indication of the STGO and
SO load capacity of a bridge.
2.5
The structural review process shall be undertaken as follows, using Appendix A of this document:
1) establish that the structure is within scope for a structural review;
2) determine the structure's year of construction;
3) determine the load carrying capacity of the structure from design or assessment documentation;
4) where design/assessment documentation is insufficient to determine load carrying capacity, review
other sources of information to determine capacity, e.g general arrangement drawings;
5) using engineering judgement decide which of three scenarios best fits the structure and the
information available and complete the appraisal using the tables and equations provided;
6) from the numerical appraisal, engineering judgement and local knowledge determine if an
assessment is justified and the priority for undertaking any assessment.
2.6
The structural review shall be documented in a record of structural review form in accordance with the
format shown in Appendix B, summarising the evidence with recommendations as to whether an
assessment is required and the priority for any assessment.
2.7
The record of structural review form shall be submitted to the TAA for acceptance.
2.8
The completed form(s) and the criteria used shall be recorded in the Overseeing Organisation's records
management system.
Assessment
2.9
An assessment shall not be carried out unless the structural review recommends that it is necessary,
and that recommendation is accepted by the TAA.
2.10
Assessments shall be carried out in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 2.N] and CS 458 [Ref 8.N] as
relevant, as well as any other published documents relevant to the specific assessment task at the time
of the assessment.
2.10.1
The level of assessment (1, 2 or 3) should be recommended in the Approval in Principle (AIP), drawing
on the advice in CS 470 [Ref 5.N] and CS 454 [Ref 2.N], taking into account the complexity of the
structure and the operational requirements of the route/network.
NOTE
Consultation with the relevant parts of the Overseeing Organisation can be beneficial if in doubt of the
level of assessment to be recommended. .
2.10.2
New assessments for HB ratings may be permitted in addition to assessment for SV load models (see
CS 458 [Ref 8.N]), subject to the agreement of the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
For the continued operation of load management systems HB ratings are sometimes required.
2.11
For consistency in reporting, all assessments shall be reported in accordance with the standard report
format shown in Appendix C.
2.12
Assessment results shall be recorded in the Overseeing Organisation's records management system.
2.13
Any structures found by assessment, and agreed with the TAA, to be unable to carry the required
operational load shall be managed in accordance with CS 470 [Ref 5.N]).

Appendix A. Risk appraisal
Appendix A. Risk appraisal
In order to fully address the risks associated with an existing structure not having had a load
assessment a number of scenarios have been developed which covers most circumstances. Where an
exact circumstance is not addressed then the closest scenario available should be used and the
reasoning for using this scenario provided. The procedure is as follows:
1) select closest applicable scenario, B1, B2 or B3;
2) select from Table A.1, Table A.2 or Table A.3 the value of variable D (B1), variable D (B2) or variable
D (B3);
3) select from Table A.4 to Table A.11 values of variables E, F, G, H, F, J, K, R1, R2, R3, interpolation
of values is not required, the value which most closely reflects the structure should be selected;
4) determine from the structure details values of structure width (W), length (L) and maximum span (S),
all measurements in metres;
5) apply these values into the following Equation A.1 to Equation A.6;
6) from the risk and reliability scores from Equation A.5 and Equation A.6 use the decision matrix,
Table A.12, to prioritise an assessment;
Equation A.1 Consequences 1
Consequences(C1) = 18000((S + 70) × R1 + (W + 70) × R2)
Equation A.2 Consequences 2
Consequences(C2) = (((9.6 × S) + 242) × L + W) + (5124 × W) + (1742 × L) + 50000
Equation A.3 Consequences 3
Consequences(C3) = 337500 × (R1 + R2)
Equation A.4 Consequences 4
Consequences(C4) = 0.4 × (R3 + C1 + C2 + C3)
Equation A.5 Reliability
Reliability = C4 × (D × E × F × G × H × J × K)
Equation A.6 Risk
Risk =
1
1000 × (D × E × F × G × H × J × K)
Scenario B1
The bridge has had an assessment and the documentation indicates an assessed load capacity for the
structure. Where different capacities have been assessed for different parts of the structure the
capacity for that part which supports the running lanes should be used.
For this scenario the variable D (B1) should be obtained from the following table:

Scenario B2
The bridge may have had an assessment however the documentation to confirm this is not complete or
is non-existent. The age of the bridge can determine if it was likely that it was included as part of an
assessment programme. It should be noted that not all bridges constructed have been required to be
assessed.
For this scenario the variable D (B2) should be obtained from the following table:
Table A.2 Variable 'D' (B2)
Confidence Level / Year
Pre-1950 or
unknown
1950-1

Scenario B3
The bridge has not had an assessment however there was no requirement for it to be assessed. Due to
changes that have occurred since construction it may now be considered prudent that the need for an
assessment should be appraised.
For this scenario the variable D (B3) should be obtained from the following table:
Table A.3 Variable 'D' (B3)

Pre-1950 or
unknown
1950-197

The following tables apply to all scenarios and address the criteria interim measures, current condition,
inspectability, monitoring, change in condition and change in loading.

considered valid but unduly conservative, in which case a new assessment might be
appropriate. Other appraisals, such as those for half-joints should be referenced if applicable.
Where a new assessment is recommended, an outline of the scope of the assessment should
be given, further details would be required in an AIP if the assessment is to be progressed.>

Introduction
Introduction
Background
Road vehicles in the United Kingdom are categorised for regulatory purposes into three broad groups,
one of which is 'special order vehicles'. This group includes vehicles that do not comply with the AW or
STGO Regulations.
In Northern Ireland the equivalent vehicles are covered by Article 60 of the Road Traffic (Northern
Ireland) Order 1995 as amended - SI 1995 No. 2994 (NI 18) [Ref 3.N]. The effects of SO vehicles are
assessed in accordance with CS 458 [Ref 2.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] and its NI NAA apply to this document.
