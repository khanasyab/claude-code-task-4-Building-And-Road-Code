4.
Communications network for emergency roadside telephones for
roadside technology and communications
Selection of communications network for emergency roadside telephones for
roadside technology and communications
4.1
ERTs for roadside technology and communications shall use either the Overseeing Organisation's
private telecommunications network or the public mobile communications network.
4.2
The type of ERT for roadside technology and communications for each location shall be selected
through the appraisal of the communications network service present at that location, to include:
1)
the public mobile communications network coverage and service availability, as well as the
presence of the Overseeing Organisation's private telecommunications network; and
2)
a comparison of the whole-life cost for the ERT where the network service is acceptable for both
types of ERT.
NOTE 1
A method for undertaking the appraisal is provided in Appendix A.
NOTE 2
The whole-life costs are not required if there is only one option that meets the network service
requirements for the ERT.
4.2.1
The whole-life cost of the ERT for roadside technology and communications provision should take into
account the Overseeing Organisation's existing telecommunications infrastructure within the scheme
extents.
Overseeing Organisation's private telecommunications network for emergency
roadside telephones for roadside technology and communications
4.3
When using the Overseeing Organisation's private telecommunications network a service delivery point
(SDP) shall be located within the ERT installation to facilitate connection to the network.
Public mobile communications network for emergency roadside telephones for
roadside technology and communications
4.4
When using the public mobile communications network, the combined service availability for the
proposed mobile operators that provide an acceptable signal level to support a single ERT shall be at
least 99.9%.
4.4.1
When the combined service availability from the proposed mobile operators that provide an acceptable
signal level to support a single ERT using the public mobile communications network cannot be
achieved, advice may be sought from the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
The service availability for mobile operators is taken from published data and is only valid for the stated
timescales. The future service availability for mobile operators cannot be guaranteed by the
Overseeing Organisation.
4.5
When using the public mobile communications network, the minimum outdoor signal level for the
proposed mobile operator networks shall be -100 dBm.
4.6
When using the public mobile communications network, the signal level for the mobile operator's
network shall be measured on-site using calibrated receiving and antenna equipment before
completion of the detailed design stage.
NOTE 1
Depending on the location of the site, different methods can be used to safely obtain signal strength
measurements to maximise operatives' safety.
NOTE 2
Mobile operators and Ofcom only provide predicted coverage levels, not measured signal levels.
4.6.1
When using the public mobile communications network, the mobile operator's network should be
obtained from more than one cellular mast to mitigate against the failure or downtime of a single mast.

5.
Siting and spacing of emergency roadside telephones for roadside
technology and communications
Emergency roadside telephone siting and spacing on motorways with a hard
shoulder
5.1
ERTs shall be sited so that the ERT can be accessed without incurring any additional risks, or so that a
telephone legend on a permanent location marker post is visible.
NOTE
Siting ERTs so that they can be accessed without incurring any additional risks, or so that a telephone
legend on a permanent location marker post is visible, can mitigate the risk of crossing carriageways or
climbing structures.
5.2
ERT siting shall be prioritised around junctions before other ERT locations.
5.2.1
ERTs should be sited in the following sequence:
1)
ERT locations on the main carriageway near junctions (before diverge and after merge connector
roads);
2)
ERT locations near to (before and after) hard shoulder discontinuities;
3)
intra-junction ERT locations;
4)
inter-junction ERT locations;
5)
ERT locations on slip roads and motorway to motorway connector roads.
5.3
ERTs on the main carriageway near junctions shall be sited in relation to the exit and entry datum points:
1)
between 400 m and 300 m upstream of the exit datum point; and,
2)
between 300 m and 400 m downstream of the entry datum point.
5.4
At sections of hard shoulder discontinuities, the ERT shall be sited between 100 m and 300 m from the
upstream and downstream tips of the discontinuity tapers.
5.5
When the full width hard shoulder length is between 100 m and 200 m, the ERT shall be sited at the
midpoint of the length of full width hard shoulder.
5.6
Where the full width hard shoulder length is not between 100 m and 200 m, the provision of ERTs along
highways shall be agreed in consultation with the Overseeing Organisation on a scheme-by-scheme
basis.
5.7
ERTs shall be sited adjacent to an intra-junction hard shoulder at least 100 m downstream of the back
of the diverge nose, with a minimum of 50 m of hard shoulder upstream and downstream of the ERT
location.
5.7.1
Intra-junction ERTs should be sited such that they are not visible from the verge of an adjacent
connector road.
NOTE
Siting Intra-junction ERTs such that they are not visible from the verge of an adjacent connector road
can mitigate the risk of pedestrians crossing live lanes to access an ERT.
5.8
Sites where conditions do not allow for intra-junction ERTs to be sited so that they are not visible from
the verge of an adjacent connector road shall be subject to a safety risk assessment.
5.9
The safety risk assessment for intra-junction ERTs visible from the verge of an adjacent connector road
shall include measures to mitigate risks associated with the risk of pedestrians crossing live lanes to
access an ERT, to demonstrate that risks have been reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.
5.10
Where full width hard shoulders are provided, ERT sites shall be sited in the verge.
5.11
Where site conditions allow, replacement ERTs shall make use of existing cross carriageway ducts.

For motorways with climbing lanes, ERT spacing shall be consistent with the number of lanes in the
link, not the number of lanes at the gradient.
5.15
Where ERTs are to be provided on connector roads, they shall be provided at regular intervals of 1,500
m +/- 10%.
Emergency roadside telephone siting on motorways without a hard shoulder or
where it is dynamically used as a running lane
5.16
ERTs shall be sited at each emergency area.
5.17
ERTs provided at an emergency area, shall be sited 2 m (+/- 1 m) downstream of the delineated
stopping bay markings.
5.18
ERTs shall be provided on a diverge connector road adjacent to a hard shoulder defined as a place of
relative safety, sited at least 100 m downstream of the back of the diverge nose with a minimum of 50 m
of hard shoulder upstream and downstream of the ERT location.
NOTE
Locating an ERT downstream of the back of the diverge nose can mitigate the risk of late manoeuvres
from the main carriageway.
5.18.1
ERTs on diverge connector roads should be sited such that they are not visible from an adjacent
intra-junction verge.
5.19
Sites where conditions do not allow for ERTs on diverge connector roads to be sited so that they are
not visible from an adjacent intra-junction road shall be subject to a safety risk assessment.
5.20
The safety risk assessment for ERTs on diverge connector roads visible from an adjacent intra-junction
road shall include measures to mitigate risks associated with the risk of pedestrians crossing live lanes
to access an ERT, to demonstrate that risks have been reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.
5.21
ERTs shall be provided at the midpoint of a new short section of hard shoulder (NSSH) on a diverge
connector road, and be sited a minimum of 100 m downstream of the back of the diverge nose.
NOTE
Locating an ERT downstream of the back of the diverge nose can mitigate the risk of late manoeuvres
from the main carriageway.
5.22
ERTs shall be provided adjacent to an intra-junction hard shoulder defined as a place of relative safety,
and be sited at least 100 m downstream of the back of the diverge nose, with a minimum of 50 m of
hard shoulder upstream and downstream of the ERT location.
5.22.1
Intra-junction ERTs should be sited such that they are not visible from the verge of an adjacent
connector road.
NOTE
Siting Intra-junction ERTs such that they are not visible from the verge of an adjacent connector road
can mitigate the risk of pedestrians crossing live lanes to access an ERT.
5.23
Sites where conditions do not allow for intra-junction ERTs to be sited so that they are not visible from
the verge of an adjacent connector road shall be subject to a safety risk assessment.
5.24
The safety risk assessment for intra-junction ERTs visible from the verge of an adjacent connector road
shall include measures to mitigate risks associated with the risk of pedestrians crossing live lanes to
access an ERT, to demonstrate that risks have been reduced so far as is reasonably practicable.
Emergency roadside telephone siting on all-purpose trunk roads
5.25
ERTs provided on all all-purpose trunk roads shall be sited at a place of relative safety.

Note 1 - Determine predicted coverage levels for each mobile operator
The predicted coverage level for each mobile operator is determined using Ofcom mobile coverage
checker [Ref 2.I].
An acceptable predicted coverage level on the Ofcom mobile coverage checker is when the outdoor
voice service is shown as "OK coverage".
Online websites are available to convert national grid references into post code areas.
A2
Note 2 - Determine the combined service availability for the mobile operators
The service availability for each mobile operator that provides an acceptable predicted coverage level
is determined using the most recent data on mobile network performance.
The combined service availability for a service that is provided by more than one mobile operator is
determined as shown in Equation A.1.
Equation A.1 Combined service availability provided by more than one mobile operator
X = 1 −
n
∏
i=1
(1 −Ai)
where:
X is combined service availability
Ai is service availability of mobile operator i over a minimum 90 days
n is the number of mobile operators with an acceptable predicted coverage at that location
i is the identifier of the mobile operator, for example A1 is the service availability of the first operator
Equation A.1 relies on the service availability percentage figures being entered in decimal form.
