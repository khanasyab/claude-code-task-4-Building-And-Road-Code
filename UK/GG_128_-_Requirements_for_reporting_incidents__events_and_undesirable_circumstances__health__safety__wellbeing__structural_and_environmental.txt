Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex sets out the National Highways-specific requirements, related advice
and guidance on the reporting and investigation of health, safety, wellbeing, structural or environmental
events, incidents and undesired circumstances.
It also sets out the requirement for the recording and reporting each month of the hours worked and the
number of workers engaged on National Highways contracts.
Why do we need to report?
Effective reporting of incidents supports the National Highways vision, "We want everyone who works
with us and who travels on our network to get home safe and well."
Consistent reporting and recording of information about incidents, events and undesired circumstances
helps us understand what happened, how and why.
In turn, this supports making informed decisions about the safety of people and the strategic road
network.
Therefore, all incidents, events and undesired circumstances described in this document need to be
reported, irrespective of cause, along with data for the total hours worked and headcount.
Who does this requirements document apply to?
This document applies to everyone who is doing any type of work directly or indirectly for or on behalf
of National Highways.
Everyone that works with, for, or on behalf of National Highways needs to read, understand and apply
the reporting and investigation requirements set out in this document.
Statutory and legal obligations
None of the requirements, advice or guidance given in this document change any obligation to report
health, safety, wellbeing, structural or environmental incidents, events or undesired circumstances to
any statutory or regulatory organisations.
Additionally, nothing in this document provides any justification to prevent or delay implementation of
mitigating actions intended to reduce risks associated with a hazard to a level so far as is reasonably
practicable (SFAIRP), as required by law or regulations.
Where an investigation is subject to legal privilege, this is not a reason to delay reporting to National
Highways. Key learning points are to summarised and shared with National Highways as soon as they
become available.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

What to report (continued)
Terms
Definitions
Damage to an infrastructure asset
(DTIA)
Damage to an infrastructure asset is a specific situation where
an unexpected defect or damage is identified on an asset that
could cause a fatal or serious injury, disrupt the operation of
the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network or otherwise
disrupt work for National Highways.
'Unexpected' in this situation means the defect or damage
could not have been identified through normal routine
maintenance or inspection activities.
'Fatal or serious injury' in this situation means a fatality or
injury that falls under the definitions in RIDDOR and has to be
reported to the Health and Safety Executive.

roads;
3) near National Highways motorway or all-purpose trunk
roads; or,
4) on National Highways land.
High-potential near miss
An unplanned, uncontrolled near-miss event that has the
potential severity to cause a reportable injury, a dangerous
occurrence, occupational disease, major injury, or fatality, or
where the learning from the near miss could provide
significant value to others. 'Serious injury' in this situation
means an injury that falls under the definitions in RIDDOR
and has to be reported to the Health and Safety Executive.

Customer in Crisis Intervention
People working on the network who are involved in
incidents with vulnerable people who are potentially
intending to take their own life.
A crisis intervention is described as "To make contact
with a person(s) with the aim to prevent them from
intentional self-harm or taking their own life".
A simple test to consider is "but for the intervention of
those concerned, the individual would have
self-harmed, attempted or taken their own life".
Positive intervention
The action of intentionally becoming involved in a
situation with the aim of improving it to prevent harm to
people or damage to an asset or to property.
Recorded in Highways Accident Reporting
Tool (HART)
An entry is made and submitted within the system by
keying in the required data to the appropriate fields
followed by the pressing of the 'Submit' button. Note: a
record or data entry only enters the system once the
'Submit' button is used - no other options are available
to capture and store data or create a record.

outside of work time.
"Directly for" means any person or machine directly
employed via a contract with National Highways (for
examples contractors, service providers and supply
chain partners), and doing work on behalf of any part of
National Highways.
"Indirectly on behalf of" means any person or machine
working for an organisation that is itself directly
employed via a contract with National Highways, and
doing work on behalf of any part of National Highways.
Work related
An event that occurs as a result of, or in connection
with work. The fact that there is an accident at work
premises does not, in itself, mean the accident is work
related. The work activity itself has thus to contribute to
the accident. An accident is 'work related' if any of the
following play a significant role
1) the way the work was carried out
2) any machinery, plant, substance or equipment used
for the work or the condition of the site or premises
where the accident happened.
Working Day 1
The first working day (Monday to Friday) of each
month, excluding Bank Holidays.

E/1. What to report
E/1.
What to report
E/1.1
Any health, safety, wellbeing, structural, environmental event or concern occurring during work for or on
behalf of National Highways listed in E/1.2 shall be reported using the Highways Accident Reporting
Tool (HART).
E/1.2
Events that shall be reported are:
1) any work-related death, defined as a death caused by or related to work for National Highways;
2) any specified injury or confirmed case of an occupational disease (diagnosed by a registered
medical practitioner) specified in RIDDOR UKSI 2013/1471 [Ref 4.N];
3) any event specified as a dangerous occurrence in the RIDDOR UKSI 2013/1471 [Ref 4.N] ;
4) any absence from work that is a reportable absence, arising where a person is injured by; whilst
carrying out; or as a consequence of a work activity and as a result is absent from work and/or
unable to perform their normal work duties for more than seven days, in accordance with RIDDOR
UKSI 2013/1471 [Ref 4.N]
5) any lost time incident;
6) any incident where a person suffers injury or ill health when working for and on behalf of National
Highways;
7) absence due to musculoskeletal injury or repetitive strain injury that is work related;
8) any high potential near miss;
9) any utility damage or disturbance;
10) any incursion;
11) any impact protection vehicle strike;
12) any incident where a person is involved in a road traffic collision when travelling for or on behalf of
National Highways business, excluding any normal commute to work;
13) any wellbeing event related to intervening with a customer in crisis;
14) any damage to a structure or an infrastructure asset;
15) any structural safety event involving a failure, or which led to an incident;
16) any structural safety concern, including high potential near miss;
17) any environmental incident, event or concern taking place as a consequence of undertaking work
directly or indirectly for National Highways;
18) any visit or contact (written or verbal) from a regulatory organisation such as the Health and Safety
Executive or the Environment Agency.
E/1.3
Exact data for headcount and hours worked shall be reported using HART by 23:59 hrs on Working
Day 1 of each month by each service provider or delivery partner for:
1) each of the contracts and projects they are working on for National Highways; and,
2) each activity they are working on for National Highways.
NOTE
All Tier 1 contractors working in a joint venture submit their own hours worked data and reportable
incidents via HART. This means each Tier 1 supplier within the joint venture is allocated the hours they
work on the project and owns the reportable incidents that involve their workforce, which improves the
accuracy of National Highways reporting for all supply chain partners.
E/1.4
The following incidents occurring during work for or on behalf of National Highways are excluded from
health, safety and wellbeing issue reporting and shall not be reported:
1) any incident that is not work related; or,
2) any incident caused by an existing underlying health condition, unless aggravated by a work activity.

E/3. Investigation requirements
E/3.
Investigation requirements
General investigation requirements
E/3.1
Incidents, events and undesired circumstances shall be investigated to:
1) identify the facts surrounding the event, such that the immediate, underlying and root causes that
led to the event can be determined;
2) establish and so enable implementation of corrective and preventive actions to prevent future harm;
and,
3) learn and share lessons such that health, safety, wellbeing and the environment are improved for
everyone.
E/3.2
All investigations shall be carried out by a competent person who has the capability to apply or use
related knowledge, skills and abilities required to successfully investigate incidents, events and
undesired circumstances.
Initial investigation report
E/3.3
For all reported events, an initial investigation report shall be provided and uploaded to HART within
three days of the event occurring.
NOTE
Initial investigations reports typically include detail of the severity or potential severity of any harm
caused, along with its causes and consequences as known at this early stage of the investigation.
E/3.4
Where the initial investigation into an incident identifies information that could prevent future harm or
raise awareness of the event, this useful information shall be shared via a safety alert.
NOTE
Upon receipt of the proposed safety alert, National Highways is to review and issue the safety alert to
notify others of the potential corrective and preventative actions to be taken and share any lessons
learned.
Full and final investigation
E/3.5
In order to maintain a valid record in HART, National Highways shall be kept informed of developments
during investigation or follow-up activity within three days.
NOTE
Where an investigation is subject to legal privilege, this is not a reason to delay reporting.
E/3.6
Where the outcomes of the investigation are subject to legal privilege, any key learning points shall be
summarised and shared as soon as they have been identified.
E/3.7
During the investigation, any additional immediate mitigating measures (corrective actions) identified
that immediately reduce risk SFAIRP and/or could prevent future harm shall be put into practice.
E/3.8
Where further preventative measures are identified that assist with reducing future risk to a level
SFAIRP (that are not immediate mitigating measures/corrective actions), these shall be described in
the final investigation report.
E/3.9
The final investigation report shall contain:
1) the immediate, underlying and root causes that led to the event as identified from the investigation
work undertaken;
2) details of mitigating measures (corrective actions) that were identified and put in place to reduce
immediate risk SFAIRP and/or could prevent future harm;
3) details of agreed mitigating measures identified that assist with reducing future risk SFAIRP;
4) an assessment of the effectiveness of the mitigating measures that have already been implemented;
5) an agreed timetable for implementation of the additional mitigating measures, to ensure that risks to
affected populations are reduced to a level that SFAIRP;
6) recommended evaluation criteria for the mitigating measures; and,

E/3. Investigation requirements
7) organisational, contractual and other issues, barriers and challenges that are likely to have
contributed to or minimised the likelihood and/ or severity of the incident.
E/3.10
The full and final investigation report shall be completed and uploaded to HART within 20 days of the
event occurring.
E/3.11
Where 20 days is insufficient for thorough investigation of the incident, an extension in time shall be
requested from National Highways.
NOTE 1
Certain events where there are complex circumstances or where serious or fatal injuries have occurred
are likely to require a longer period of time for a full investigation to be completed.
NOTE 2
Sign-off 1 (event closure) is carried out by the supply chain. Sign-off 2 for RIDDOR reportable
investigations is the responsibility of National Highways.
E/3.12
When any investigation is concluded, the record in HART shall undergo a final check by the record
owner, with updates made to the record to ensure accuracy and completeness.
E/3.13
Once the final check has been completed, the record owner shall indicate that the record is complete
and accurate by completing the required level of sign-off.
NOTE
The level of sign-off is determined by the severity of the event. All events require level 1 sign-off,
however event types of a higher severity will also require a level 2 sign-off.
