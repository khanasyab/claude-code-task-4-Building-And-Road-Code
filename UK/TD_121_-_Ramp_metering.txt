Introduction
Introduction
Background
Ramp metering is a traffic management technique which manages the number of vehicles joining a
main carriageway at peak periods. The purpose of ramp metering is to prevent or delay the onset of
flow breakdown on the main carriageway and assist with its recovery.
Ramp metering systems use part-time traffic signals on the slip road which come into operation when
traffic sensors on the main carriageway indicate heavy traffic. The detectors on the main carriageway
along with queue detectors on the slip road enable the system to determine the required flows from the
slip to keep the main carriageway flowing close to critical occupancy.
A successful design of a ramp metering site relies on knowledge and understanding of motorway
communication devices and design, traffic flows, motorway traffic behaviours and ramp metering
control algorithms.
Ramp metering systems aim to control the flow of vehicles joining the motorway and all-purpose trunk
road network and are recognised as being fundamentally different to traditional traffic signalling
systems which manage vehicle conflicts and provide safety functionality.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

3. Design
3.
Design
General
3.1
Prior to commencing design, an operational strategy document shall be completed to assist with design
decisions.
NOTE 1
The operational strategy document template is in Appendix A.
NOTE 2
Information is recorded in the operational strategy document to both assist with design decisions during
detailed design of a ramp metering site and to assist with generating initial system settings used in the
configuration file at the beginning of the site calibration process.
3.1.1
The operational strategy document should be completed based upon:
1)
the traffic characteristics and road geometry;
2)
an understanding of the cause and effect of congestion at the intended installation location; and,
3)
an understanding of ramp metering operation.
3.1.2
The sequence of the ramp metering site design should be:
1)
determine the position of the stop line and traffic signal poles;
2)
determine the position of presence and release detectors;
3)
determine the position of queue override detectors;
4)
determine the total number and position of queue detectors;
5)
determine the position of equipment cabinets and associated infrastructure;
6)
determine the position/select main carriageway detector sites;
7)
determine the position and design warning signs and road markings;
8)
determine the extents of high friction surfacing (HFS) provision; and,
9)
develop the site configuration file.
NOTE
Fixed warning signs and HFS design can commence once the stop line and queue override detector
locations are known.
3.2
The condition of the site shall be assessed to ensure that the existing pavement is capable of
accommodating the ramp metering infrastructure (e.g., detectors, HFS, road markings).
3.3
Infrastructure not protected by vehicle restraint systems shall employ passively safe functionality.
NOTE
Signs and signals mounted on passively safe poles typically have a minimum mounting height of 1800
mm.
3.4
Following the implementation and switch on of a site, the performance shall be evaluated to ensure it
gives the optimum benefits.
NOTE
On-going, periodic assessment ensures that the operational performance is maintained and that the
site is not affecting traffic conditions negatively.
Stop line and traffic signal pole positions
3.5
The position of the stop line shall be determined:
1)
in accordance with the operational strategy document;
2)
to provide a balance between sufficient acceleration distance to enable safe merging and
sufficient storage for queuing vehicles; and,
3)
to provide forward visibility of the signal heads for vehicles approaching the stop line.
3.5.1
The main carriageway conditions adjacent to the merge should be visible from any vehicle stopped at
the stop line.

TD 121 Version 0.0.2
3. Design
NOTE 1
The location of the stop line has an impact on safety and governs visibility for drivers approaching the
signals and queue on the entry slip road.
NOTE 2
A stationary vehicle behind the stop line needs to accelerate to reach a suitable speed and merge
safely with traffic travelling in lane 1 of the main carriageway during ramp metering operation
(anticipated ramp metering switch-on speed as detailed in the operational strategy).
NOTE 3
The greater the distance between the ramp metering site and the downstream congestion seed point,
the higher the main carriageway speeds are at the upstream detector.
NOTE 4
If the main carriageway uses variable mandatory speed limits, speeds can be controlled/reduced as a
result of unrelated control algorithms rather than an increase in traffic density.
NOTE 5
The impact of an incorrect switch on speed can be:
1)
the ramp metering system becomes operational too late, after flow breakdown has already
occurred and does not provide the maximum benefit possible; or
2)
vehicles are unable to reach the necessary speed to safely merge with lane 1 of the main
carriageway.
NOTE 6
The typical distance from the back of nose to the ramp metering stop line is 40 metres +/- 20 metres.
3.6
The ramp metering signals must be provided in accordance with UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 5.N]
diagram 3000 and its authorised, non-prescribed variants.
NOTE
Authorisation for implementing ramp metering schemes incorporating light signals on motorway and all
purpose trunk roads are described in the National Application Annexes.
3.7
Passively safe traffic signal poles shall be positioned 2 metres downstream of the stop line, one in the
offside verge and one in the nearside verge.
3.8
The distance from each kerb for passively safe signal poles shall be 2 metres +1 metre / - 0.8 metre.
Presence and release detector locations
3.9
Presence detectors shall be provided with the trailing edge of the detector being 2 metres upstream of
the stop line.
3.10
Release detectors shall be provided with the leading edge of the detector being 2 metres downstream
of the stop line.
Queue override detector locations
3.11
Queue override detectors shall be positioned downstream of the adjoining network boundary to allow
an area of road space which accommodates vehicles and avoids additional obstructions on the
adjoining road network.
3.11.1
Queue override detectors should be positioned to provide a zone with minimum length of 39 metres in
advance of the queue override detectors.
NOTE
The minimum length of 39 metres allows sufficient road space on the entry slip road for two heavy
goods vehicles to approach the back of the queuing traffic (the queue override detectors) without
obstructing the adjoining road network.
3.12
Queue override detectors shall be positioned to limit the maximum queuing time on the slip.
3.13
Queue override detectors shall be positioned no more than 300 metres from the stop line.
Queue detector locations
3.14
Queue detectors shall be evenly spaced between the presence detectors and queue override detectors.
NOTE
The queue management algorithm operates most effectively when the detector spacing is evenly
distributed.

3. Design
3.14.1
The queue detectors should be provided such that the distances between these detectors are as near
to 25 metres as possible.
3.15
A minimum of two queue detectors per lane shall be provided on the entry slip road, with 25 metres
between adjacent detectors.
3.15.1
A maximum of seven queue detectors per lane may be provided.
3.15.2
The spacing of the queue detectors should be as consistent as site conditions permit to allow the ramp
metering system to operate most effectively.
NOTE
Where other existing detectors (for example those used for MIDAS) located on the entry slip road clash
with the desired ramp metering queue detector locations, either the number of queue detectors can be
reduced, or the other existing detectors can be relocated further upstream or downstream.
Equipment cabinets and their associated infrastructure
3.16
Equipment cabinets shall be located in a position where safe access is permitted.
3.16.1
The ramp metering outstation (RMO) cabinet should be positioned to allow the signal heads to be
observed from the cabinet position to aid commissioning and maintenance.
NOTE
Providing a safe area on site for validation of the ramp metering system (e.g. site acceptance testing,
calibration and maintenance) enables the validation exercise to be carried out in a safe and convenient
manner whilst avoiding the need for traffic management and a negative impact on vehicle behaviours.
3.17
Equipment cabinets shall accommodate the RMO and provide power to the site as part of a ramp
metering system installation.
3.17.1
A dedicated power supply outlet on the electrical interface cabinets should be provided to avoid the
ramp metering system tripping out the local power supply unit.
3.18
A dedicated duct network shall accommodate the traffic signal cable between the RMO and each traffic
signal pole.
Main carriageway detector selection
3.19
At least one downstream detector site shall be located in advance (upstream) of the area of the main
carriageway where flow breakdown occurs.
NOTE
The downstream detector site is necessary to provide the RMO with an accurate measurement of lane
occupancy in the area of the main carriageway where flow breakdown occurs. If the detector site is
located beyond where flow breakdown occurs it can fail to detect the network congestion.
3.20
The upstream detector shall be located upstream of the merge with no exit slip roads between the
detector site and the merge.
NOTE 1
The upstream detector site is necessary to measure the speed in lane 1 of the main carriageway prior
to the point adjacent to the merge tip of nose. The closer the detector site is to the merge, the more
accurate the measurement of speed on the main carriageway at the point where traffic from the entry
slip merges.
NOTE 2
An existing MIDAS installation can be a source for upstream and downstream main carriageway
detectors.
Warning signs and road markings
3.21
The ramp metering site shall use warning signs and road markings to maintain lane discipline and to
advise drivers about the hazards associated with the use of ramp metering signals and the likelihood of
the presence of queues.
3.22
Where the entry slip road has multiple access points, the requirement for additional fixed signs shall be
assessed.

The stop line is described in UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 5.N] diagram 1001.
3.26
Lane markings and road studs shall be provided in accordance with UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 5.N]
diagrams 1004.1 and 1005.1.
3.27
For sites with reduced sight lines, an assessment of the use of electronic/variable message signs to
provide advanced warning of the operation of ramp metering shall be undertaken.
NOTE
Experience shows that electronic/variable signs which activate only when ramp metering is in operation
can be used effectively to provide advanced warning about likely presence of queues.
High friction surfacing (HFS)
3.28
HFS shall be provided on approach to the stop line and the queue override detectors.
3.28.1
If the queue override detectors are installed less than 50 metres downstream of the start of the entry slip
road, the HFS should be installed from the start of the entry slip road to the queue override detectors.
3.28.2
Longer lengths of HFS may be provided at sites with poor sight lines (for example due to road
curvature) or at sites where longer stopping distances are required (for example due to a downhill entry
slip road) to enable vehicles to stop safely.
3.29
The implementation of HFS shall preserve or improve the integrity of existing lane markings and road
studs.
Site configuration file
3.30
The initial software configuration necessary for the site's operation shall be defined for inclusion in the
site configuration file.
NOTE
The site configuration file contains all the site-specific configuration and calibration settings to allow the
system to operate at a specific junction/site. This includes, for example, the main carriageway and
ramp detectors, initial algorithm variables, passwords and access levels.
