Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document contains the requirements related to the non destructive testing (NDT) of highways
structures.
Typical uses of NDT for highway structures are as follows:
1) gaining increased assurance as to the quality of new construction such as weld testing of steelwork;
2) gaining increased assurance as to the integrity of earlier construction where similar types of
construction have been shown to be defective, such as detecting voids in post-tensioned concrete;
3) providing an indication of the possible internal structure of old bridges for assessment purposes,
such as the structural form of masonry arches;
4) providing supplementary indications of the condition of structures which are showing signs of
distress, such as the degree of contamination and corrosion of reinforced concrete bridges exposed
to chloride attack; and,
5) recording acoustic emissions from bearings exhibiting cracking or excessive friction or from bedding
to bearings undergoing cracking.
The expert interpretation of NDT results can be of assistance with structural appraisal.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

CS 464 Revision 1
2. Preliminary work
2.
Preliminary work
Assessment of the structure condition
2.1
A visual inspection of the structure shall precede specification of a testing programme.
NOTE
An initial visual inspection allows particular circumstances and the current condition of the structure to
be taken into account.
2.2
During the preliminary stage, the following factors shall be determined:
1) visual defects that require further investigation;
2) the influence of access and test number on costs;
3) the effectiveness of a staged approach in prevailing circumstances;
4) the cost of tests relative to the potential significance of the irregularities; and,
5) the time required for test results and their interpretation, if further testing is dependent upon results.
NOTE
Due to the varied nature of structures and their defects, specification of the same types and number of
tests as used on another structure is rarely likely to be appropriate.
2.2.1
In order to assess the current capacity, and the likely durability of a structure and to plan remedial
works, the following information should be obtained:
1) age of the structure and the dates of any modifications or repairs;
2) materials with which the structure has been built or modified;
3) properties of these materials, such as strength and ductility;
4) geometry of the bridge, the size of members and details of the joints; and,
5) condition of the members, joints and protection of the structure, including defects; corrosion, and
distortion or damage including fatigue damage.
2.2.2
Testing programmes should be devised, upon assessing the following:
1) striking a balance between obtaining sufficient information to make a reasonable judgement on risk,
and seeking so much information that the examination itself compromises durability by intrusive
sampling;
2) the effectiveness of testing in combination; for example ducts can be located by specialist probes or
radar in preparation for intrusive drilling and sampling or impact-echo testing as per guidance in
Impact-Echo of PT concrete [Ref 3.I] and NDT 2004 [Ref 4.I];
3) tests can be interpreted in combination; for example a representative sample of locations revealing a
particular characteristic can be examined in greater detail by a variety of more detailed tests as per
guidance in ACI Technical Report 228.2R-13 [Ref 10.I];
4) particular characteristics can be examined in greater detail by a variety of more detailed tests;
5) testing programmes are only provisional, and can require amendment as a result of continuing
testing and interpretation. Staged testing, permitting interpretation of results between each stage,
can be appropriate on larger jobs; and,
6) intrusive drilling and sampling can provide invaluable information on materials, corrosion details,
void volumes, and atmospheric leakage in order to calibrate the NDT techniques.
2.2.3
The condition evidence required may be obtained by combining different examination and test
methods, each one offering particular advantages and disadvantages:
1) visual examination including, for example, looking for corrosion, cracks, deformities, mechanical
damage or indication of slip or movement at joints or at the interface between concrete deck and
steel beams;
2) testing of small samples of the materials taken from structurally safe locations to determine
properties unless these are known with certainty;

CS 464 Revision 1
2. Preliminary work
3) geometric survey to determine straightness, verticality, deformation and deflection of members, and
the positions and sizes of members and details of joints;
4) hammer tapping survey, where appropriate, to determine soundness of bolts and rivets, or corrosion
leading to delamination within wrought iron members; and,
5) NDT techniques to locate and/or size defects, and to determine member or paint thickness.
NOTE
The effectiveness of NDT methods can be heavily influenced by the geometry and materials of the
structure under investigation, such as the depth reinforcement or other key hidden structural elements
as per guidance in Martin, J. & Forde, M.C. (1995) [Ref 6.I] and Lyons et al 2005 [Ref 7.I].
Selecting appropriate NDT methods
2.3
The prevailing condition of the structure shall be assessed to determine a suitable combination of tests
that together build up a picture of the structure and its condition.
NOTE 1
NDT techniques are not definitive, and require calibration and therefore it can be necessary to
frequently evaluate the results from different tests in combination, in order to achieve a meaningful
interpretation.
NOTE 2
A return to site, after the analysis of early tests, to undertake further testing can be necessary.
2.4
The effectiveness of each NDT method in the prevailing situation shall be predicted in advance of
specification.
NOTE
The effectiveness and accuracy of each NDT method for use in a particular structure and in specific
circumstances can be different.
2.4.1
Staged work should be identified to enable targeted testing and determine more detailed information
about features identified in earlier tests.
NOTE
Additional tests can be required in order to determine the extent of structural features or faults.
2.4.2
Prior to commissioning the NDT, a site visit should be undertaken to assess the structure and the
suitability of the proposed testing strategies, as well as to determine any specific requirements.
2.4.3
The testing strategy should be chosen through consultation between the designer and the testing
contractor.
2.4.4
NDT should only be used where, after allowing for the accuracy of the testing, the results would
usefully inform on the assessed capacity of a structure.
NOTE 1
A sensitivity analysis can be necessary prior to commencing the works to identify whether NDT testing
is sufficiently accurate to be useful.
NOTE 2
Trial NDT testing can be necessary to establish that a full set of testing provides useful data.

Post-tensioned concrete structures
6.2
For testing of conditions within post-tensioned ducts, the following information shall be included:
1) the location of the ducts and tendons;
2) the presence and characteristics of voids within ducts;
3) the existing degree of tendon corrosion; and,
4) the probability of future corrosion.
NOTE
Guidance on NDT of post tensioned structures is set out in CS 465 [Ref 8.I], and CS TR72 [Ref 2.N].
Masonry arches
6.3
The appropriateness of different testing techniques shall be evaluated depending on disruption costs,
depth of the investigation required, the extent and the nature of the structure to be investigated in
accordance with recommendations of RILEM [Ref 12.I] and McCann et al [Ref 11.I].
6.3.1
Visual inspection may be used to identify the geometry of the arch, the surface condition of the
masonry and the location of surface defects.
NOTE 1
Masonry arch bridges are highly variable in their geometry and construction.
NOTE 2
Hollowness of the masonry can be identified, in conjunction with visual inspection, by hammer tap
testing or coin-tap-testing on the surface.
NOTE 3
Routine investigations, used to supplement a visual inspection, generally comprise trial holes
excavated on top of the bridges, through the surfacing and fill to expose the upper surface of the barrel
or any backing.
NOTE 4
Where the initial inspection indicates the need, or the purpose of the survey requires it, further
investigation can be carried out by coring to determine the nature and condition of the internal masonry.
6.3.2
Cores may be used to determine the compressive strength of the masonry.
Impact echo
6.4
Procedures shall be adopted to minimise damage to the surface caused by the impactor used for the
impact echo tests to ensure the concrete surface does not crumble on impact.
NOTE
Minimising damage to the structure being tested reduces inaccuracies in the results from the impact
echo test.
6.4.1
Impact echo testing may be carried out in line with guidance set out in Carino & Sansalone 1992 [Ref
1.I] and Carino & Sansalone 1984 [Ref 9.I].
NOTE
Carino, N. J. et. al. NDT 2004 [Ref 4.I] describes impact echo test method and provides information
about where the techniques can be applied.
6.5
The limitations of impact echo testing shall be assessed prior to carrying out any testing.

6. Specific structure/method requirements
NOTE 1
Dense reinforcement can affect the accuracy of impact echo testing readings - see Martin, J. & Forde,
M.C. (1995) [Ref 6.I].
NOTE 2
Outer ducts can mask impact echo readings from inner ducts - see Carino & Sansalone 1992 [Ref 1.I].
6.5.1
Vacuum testing rather than sonic techniques should be used to determine the volume of the voids in
grouted ducts as a precursor to re-grouting them in accordance with The Concrete Society's Technical
Report 'Durable post-tensioned concrete structures', 2010 CS TR72 [Ref 2.N].
6.5.2
The test report from the impact echo test should include the following:
1) the likely impact frequency achieved and the ball bearing sizes used at each location; and,
2) a discussion of the ball sizes and frequencies used and a demonstration of whether these were
appropriate for locating voids at all locations investigated.
Sonic tomography for masonry arches
6.6
The tender documentation setting out the NDT testing scope shall set out specific requirements
associated with sonic tomography.
6.6.1
The tender documents should include the requirement that the following additional information is
provided:
1) the number of sonic transmission transits required through each element and whether tomography is
to be used; and,
2) all available construction details of the structure to be tested.
6.6.2
The testing organisations providing sonic tomography testing should be asked to state:
1) the type of sonic survey proposed and proposed transit locations; and,
2) details of the hammer to be used.
6.6.3
The specification setting out the requirements for the sonic tomography testing should require details of
the sonic survey carried out and the transit locations used.
NOTE
Colla et al (1997) [Ref 13.I] describes sonic tomography test method and provides information about
where the techniques can be applied.
6.6.4
The sonic tomography test method may be used when surveying the structure of masonry arches to
identify construction details, voids and poor compaction of fill materials as per recommendations in
Colla et al (1997) [Ref 13.I].
NOTE
The tomographic procedure can be very time consuming unless multiple receiving transducers are
used.
6.6.5
Anomalies identified during sonic tomography testing should be further investigated by drilling or
excavation.
6.7
Surface damage to the structure during sonic tomography testing shall be minimised.
Ground penetrating radar
6.8
The following additional information shall be required within the tender documentation for ground
penetrating radar (GPR):

6. Specific structure/method requirements
5) expected standard of interpretation of the results, such as voids detected or no voids detected –
together with a percentage confidence level.
6.8.1
GPR may be employed both for structural monitoring in time and for checking the outcome of repair
interventions as per ASTM D6087-03 [Ref 14.I].
NOTE
ASTM D6087-03 [Ref 14.I] and Malhotra, V.M et. al. NDT 2004 [Ref 4.I] describe the GPR test method
and provide information about where the techniques can be applied.
6.9
Testing objectives shall depend on the geometry and material of the structure.
6.9.1
Test locations should be dictated by engineering objectives such as areas of high load concentrations
or areas critical to the structural integrity.
6.9.2
Any variation in material quality or condition throughout the structure should be measured if possible.
6.9.3
Dimensions including spans, deck widths, structural depths etc. should be measured accurately to
enable subsequent mapping to be undertaken.
6.9.4
The deliverables from the testing should include the following information:
1) whether used in monostatic or bi-static arrangement;
2) the number and frequency of the operating antennae;
3) the time range used and rate of data recording (number of scans per second, number of samples
per scan, etc.);
4) whether filtering and gain were applied and of which kind;
5) use of survey wheel on the antenna and antenna orientation in relation of the direction of scan;

9) whether transmission or reflection mode survey has been carried out and the surface distance
covered by transmitting and receiving antennae;
10) test results compiled in the form of grey-scale plot accompanied by time window or depth scale; and,
11) 2-D and 3-D interpretative model.
Acoustic emission
6.10
Prior to commissioning the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring, the root cause, damage mechanisms
and an awareness of how and when the damage is likely to propagate shall be identified in order to
specify the duration and extent of monitoring.
NOTE 1
BS EN 13554 [Ref 5.N] describes the AE test method and provide information about where the
techniques can be applied.
NOTE 2
A short AE monitoring duration can miss defects inactive under prevalent conditions whereas extended
monitoring can provide no further new information.
NOTE 3
Typical uses of AE are as follows:
1) detection of cracking and failure in concrete structure;
2) detection of deterioration in reinforced concrete bridges, in particular for providing information on the
condition of half joints and hinge joints, and detecting reinforcement corrosion;
3) detection of the residual strength of concrete beam;
4) detection of wire fractures in steel cables in both suspension and cable stayed bridges; also
detecting tendon wire breaks in post-tensioned concrete bridges tendons;
5) detection and location of cracks in welded steel structures;

girders, steel corbels, shear studs and bridge bearings; and,
12) detection of secondary effects of steel fatigue such as plastic deformation and crack face fretting
(rubbing).

a typical sensor;
2) the method used to hold the sensor to the structure;
3) the method of coupling the sensor;
4) the method for verifying sensor sensitivity, location accuracy and attenuation of the structure; and,
5) make and model of AE data capturing system.
6.10.3
Global and semi-global monitoring should be used for steel plate structures.
6.10.4
Local monitoring may be used for both steel and the more heavily damped concrete structures.
6.10.5
The chosen testing strategy should identify the level of monitoring (number of sensors and information
required) and the duration of monitoring.
6.10.6
The monitoring of fatigue cracking in a steel structure using an AE technique should be performed with
a representative period of vehicular loading, such as one day on motorway bridges or two or more days
for less frequently trafficked bridges as per Mori & Obata 1998 [Ref 2.I].
6.11
Where appropriate, AE shall be used for long-term/permanent monitoring.
6.11.1
Long-term/permanent AE monitoring should be used in the following circumstances:
1) when the defect is serious and failure or an increase in damage size could lead to the closure of a
structure;
2) where damage propagation is sporadic with long intervals in between where a short period of
monitoring could miss AE activity;
3) sub-standard bridges, as described in CS 470 [Ref 4.N] as examples, detection of wire breaks in
suspension cables, cable stays and post-tensioning tendons; and,
4) where a structure requires periodic evaluation to assess degradation.
6.12
The location accuracy of the AE monitoring system shall be verified before the start of a test.
6.13
The position of detected AE sources found during testing shall be verified at the end of the test.
6.13.1
Verification tests should use Hsu-Nielsen source (pencil lead break) device to simulate an AE event in
accordance with BS EN 1330-9 [Ref 7.N]).
6.13.2
Active AE locations may be followed up with more sensor-intensive monitoring.
6.13.3
Where defects are suspected within a structure, it may be beneficial to use a more intensive strategy
such as semiglobal or local monitoring from the outset to provide accurate source location.
6.13.4
Specific additional requirements such as specific method of installation, test objectives, outputs from
monitoring or limitations should be set out where required for AE monitoring in accordance with BS EN
13554 [Ref 5.N].

CS 464 Revision 1
6. Specific structure/method requirements
6.16.1
The selection of the AE system should enable waveform feature recognition with separate data
channels, be able to measure individual signal amplitude (dBAE), risetime, duration, absolute energy
and counts, as an absolute minimum and have a sufficient sampling rate for feature extraction and
waveform analysis.
6.16.2
Suitable sensors should be selected depending on:
1) material, geometry and size of the structure under test;
2) working environment;
3) type of data analysis required;
4) sensitivity and frequency range required; and,
5) signal attenuation in the material under test.
6.16.3
Global monitoring of the whole structure should use large spacings between sensors and local
monitoring closer spacing.
6.16.4
Clamps should be used to hold the sensors in place and cables to be held in position to avoid
interference from electromagnetic signals.
6.16.5
The settings of the AE instrumentation should be in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's
recommendations where records are to be kept of the settings used during the test.
6.16.6
The sensitivity of sensors should be checked in accordance with procedure BS EN 1330-9 [Ref 7.N],
where the checks are to be done at the beginning, at the end and if possible in the middle of the test.
6.16.7
A noise and attenuation study should be performed.
6.16.8
During AE monitoring additional formation, such as displacement and/or strain, together with the
environmental conditions under which the measurements were made such as wind, temperature and
rain, should be recorded and utilised when setting the threshold value of the equipment.
6.16.9
The following universal AE set-up information should be included for an acoustic emission bridge
investigation:
1) the threshold used for recording signals and whether AE waveforms were also recorded and the
corresponding threshold;
2) the type and accuracy of source location and whether location accuracy is based on an
experimental investigation on the structure or previous investigations, including references;
3) the background noise level. Where background noise were unacceptable, details of the methods
used to control it, such as guard sensors, using location analysis to exclude known sources of noise
from the analysis, or other established methods.

7. Interpretation of results
7.
Interpretation of results
7.1
The data collected shall be interpreted with reference to what it means in terms of physical features or
material properties.
NOTE 1
Testing assists in the determination of the condition of a structure at a particular time. It can be
necessary or cost effective to take remedial action at that time, or it can be considered safe and
economical to delay remedial action.
NOTE 2
Where remedial action is delayed, it can be prudent to monitor deterioration to ensure safety is
maintained and to determine the optimum time for remedial action.
7.1.1
Monitoring may be carried out by retesting at intervals or by continuous monitoring whereby equipment
is installed which records information at short intervals on a regular basis.
7.2
The accuracy of predicted NDT results shall be checked before reliance is placed on the results.
7.3
The limitations of the NDT technique used shall be taken into account in assessing the results.
Results
7.4
The following key issues shall be assessed prior to installing continuous monitoring:
1) robustness of site equipment and its ability to withstand elements of the weather and sited to
minimise the risk of vandalism;
2) maintenance of system including its power source by either battery or mains with battery back-up;
3) data logging capacity and its potential to store the required data between downloads and
transferring the data to an offsite computer remotely;
4) facilities for analysing potentially large volumes of data.
7.5
Results from testing shall be used to inform future maintenance strategies including whether to:
1) repair;
2) monitor by automated monitoring or repeat testing;
3) leave unrepaired and revert to standard inspections.
7.6
When establishing the monitoring requirements, any additional monitoring required in conjunction with
the main data shall be specified.
NOTE 1
Additional monitoring can include an accurate measure of the temperature at the same time as strain
measurements or core and surface temperature monitoring to allow temperature gradients to be
determined. This can be particularly applicable where solar radiation can induce large thermal
differences, causing displacements and strains.
NOTE 2
Ambient air temperatures alone cannot fully determine differential structure temperatures.
