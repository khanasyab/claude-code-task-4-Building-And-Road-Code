Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives the requirements and advice for the design of vegetated drainage systems to
convey, store and treat runoff from motorways and all-purpose trunk roads. It has been developed to
address the requirements of the European Parliament Directive 2000/60/EC [Ref 5.I] and the
Assessment and Management of Floods Directive 2007/60/EC [Ref 12.I]. These systems can provide
benefits arising from their sustainability. They are described as vegetated drainage systems because
they contain a significant element of vegetation and they are designed for use especially in the
drainage networks of motorways and all purpose trunk roads.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard", or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 5.N].

2. Selection of vegetated drainage systems
2.
Selection of vegetated drainage systems
2.1
Where vegetated drainage systems are implemented, they shall be used as components of a drainage
network to convey, store and treat water running off motorways and all-purpose trunk roads, before it
outfalls to the receiving waters.
2.1.1
Vegetated drainage systems may be designed to supplement or replace conventional drainage
systems.
2.1.2
A landscape assessment, combined with a hydrological study, an ecological survey and an
archaeological investigation, may be used to influence the nature, scale and location of a vegetated
drainage system.
NOTE 1
Vegetated drainage systems are a type of sustainable drainage.
NOTE 2
Descriptions of vegetated drainage systems are given in Appendix B.
NOTE 3
A landscape assessment, combined with a hydrological study and an ecological survey can help to
secure a well-integrated system within its site context; protecting existing landscape features (natural or
man-made) wherever desirable, reflecting the character of the surrounding landscape. Further
information can be found in LA 108 [Ref 1.I] and LD 117 [Ref 8.I].
NOTE 4
Guidance on the character of the surrounding landscape is often available from the statutory
environmental consultees.
2.2
Vegetated drainage systems shall be designed to mimic the characteristics of the existing local
hydrology of the area.
NOTE
Mimicking the characteristics of the existing local hydrology can ensure the systems do not increase
flood risk within the local catchment.
2.3
Where the vegetated drainage system offers the opportunity to deliver other environmental benefits
these shall be identified at the beginning of the design process.
2.4
In providing for other environmental benefits, the design shall not adversely affect the primary function
of a vegetated drainage system to convey, store and treat water running off motorways and all-purpose
trunk roads.
NOTE
Other environmental benefits can include, but are not limited to, improved biodiversity, enhanced
groundwater recharge, improved amenity and reduced use of energy.
2.5
A review of the planning context shall be carried out to establish the presence of any international,
national or local designations within, adjacent to or in the vicinity of the proposed site area that can be
affected.
2.5.1
Where designated sites that can be affected are identified, vegetated drainage systems can be
particularly appropriate and the acquisition of any additional land required for them may be justified on
account of the environmental benefits they can bring.
2.5.2
Where designated sites that can be affected are identified, the use of more than one vegetated
drainage system may be justified.
NOTE 1
References to wildlife legislation, designated sites and areas of potential nature conservation interest
are given in table 3.24 in LA 108 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
A review of the planning context can indicate the relative importance of the landscape and ecology of
the area, and whether it is likely that environmental mitigation will be a significant part of a road scheme.
Treatment of highway runoff
2.6
The level of treatment of highway runoff shall be determined by the assessment of the potential impact
on the receiving water body.
NOTE
Methods for assessing highway runoff are described in LA 113 [Ref 7.N].

CD 532 Version 0.2.0
2. Selection of vegetated drainage systems
2.7
A vegetated drainage system shall be designed to treat all runoff from the design rainfall event.
2.7.1
Where it is not possible to treat all the water in a rainfall event, the systems should be designed to treat
the first flush separately.
NOTE 1
The intensity of highway runoff can be influenced by the climate. Areas in the south-east of the UK,
although having the lowest annual rainfall, experience the most intense storms.
NOTE 2
When intense rainfall events follow long dry periods, the build-up of pollutants on the road surface is
washed off first. The highway runoff from the first part of a rainfall event is usually the most seriously
polluted, and referred to as the 'first flush' effect of a storm.
NOTE 3
Discharges from short intense storms with long antecedent dry periods pose a higher pollution threat
than discharges from longer rainfall events, which provide higher dilution.
NOTE 4
Loadings of heavy metals and organic compounds (especially aromatic hydrocarbons) and sometimes
suspended solids, tend to be of greatest concern.
NOTE 5
A high proportion of highway pollutants are found to be adsorbed to the fine silt fraction of the
suspended solids. By collecting, filtering and treating the fine sediment which is subsequently removed,
the system is dealing with a significant part of the runoff pollution.
Other factors affecting the selection of systems
Land availability
2.8
To inform decisions about land acquisition, the purpose of the vegetated drainage system shall be
clearly defined early in the design process.
2.8.1
This land may need to be acquired, or rights of access obtained for maintenance, which could impose
their own constraints on the landscape.
2.8.2
For improvement schemes, where land availability can be limited, it may be necessary to acquire extra
land where it is necessary to achieve an efficient design.
2.8.3
Installation of infiltration trenches and long linear ponds may be feasible if designed to tie in with
existing features.
2.8.4
Where existing ponds are available, it may be possible for these to be adapted, provided that their use
for attenuation or treatment is ecologically acceptable.
NOTE 1
Whilst the designs described in this document represent an ideal to be aimed at, in sites where land
availability is limited, a compromise solution is preferable to a design without any vegetated drainage
system.
NOTE 2
By making landowners aware of the benefits of using vegetated drainage systems, it can often be
possible to obtain the necessary land by agreement.
Soil permeability
2.9
When selecting vegetated drainage systems for use in permeable areas, the design must be in
accordance with the requirements of the 2000/60/EC [Ref 5.I] to avoid pollution of the saturated zone
by hazardous substances.
2.9.1
On permeable soils, where swales (see Section 3 and Appendix B), grassed channels, infiltration
basins and trenches are potentially effective solutions, the design should mitigate the effects of the
possible transmission of pollutants to the underlying subsoil, particularly where vegetated drainage
systems are situated above aquifers.
2.10
Where proposed sites for vegetated drainage systems are situated above aquifers, the vulnerability of
the groundwater shall be identified by reference to the groundwater vulnerability maps, information on
abstraction source protection zones and by consultation with the EPA.
2.11
When designing vegetated drainage systems to protect discharges to groundwater bodies, they shall
be designed to mitigate the risks assessed using the method in Appendix C in LA 113 [Ref 7.N].

2. Selection of vegetated drainage systems
2.11.1
Where reliable information is available on the attenuating properties of the subsoil in respect of
pollutants routinely found in highway runoff, this may be used as an alternative to the method in
Appendix C in LA 113 [Ref 7.N] for determining the need to mitigate the risks to groundwater bodies.
NOTE 1
Where the risk of groundwater pollution from highway runoff is unacceptable (using assessment
methods described in LA 113 [Ref 7.N]), an impermeable membrane to prevent seepage from the
vegetated drainage system can provide a solution.
NOTE 2
Impermeable membranes can prevent contamination or flooding of the drainage system by the
surrounding groundwater.
NOTE 3
In areas of impermeable soils, swales are less effective and wetlands and ponds are generally more
suitable. Ponds tend to retain water, and basins designed to allow infiltration have to be constructed
above the impermeable soil, using suitable granular materials.
2.12
Where an impermeable liner is designed for vegetated drainage systems, its depth and location shall be
clearly identified on drawings to reduce the risk of accidental damage during maintenance operations.
2.13
Where vegetated drainage systems are to be designed in areas with erosion-susceptible soils, such as
sands or silts, the maximum design velocity of the highway runoff shall be low enough to prevent
erosion.
2.14
Where it is not possible to minimise the design velocity of the water flowing through a vegetated
drainage system, rip-rap, flow spreaders or concrete aprons shall be designed to reduce velocities and
prevent scour.
Topography
2.15
The surrounding topography shall be used to integrate the vegetated drainage system into the
landscape.
NOTE 1
In areas with little or no gradients, larger systems such as wetlands, basins or ponds are possible if
sufficient water is available to prevent wetlands and ponds from drying out.
NOTE 2
In undulating countryside, treatment and attenuation systems can be smaller and more frequent to
blend into the landscape.
NOTE 3
In undulating countryside, ponds and basins are possible, but swales, which require gentle even
slopes, are harder to design sympathetically.
NOTE 4
Figures 2.15N4a and 2.15N4b show indicative sections of vegetated drainage systems in undulating
and flat landscapes.

2. Selection of vegetated drainage systems
Spillage risk
2.16
Where a vegetated drainage system is chosen, it shall include a method to control the discharge of any
spillage, regardless of whether designated containment provision is made.
NOTE
It can only take one spillage incident to cause considerable damage to the receiving water body.
2.17
The selection of mitigation measures such as spillage containment and control facilities shall be
determined to mitigate the risks assessed using LA 113 [Ref 7.N] and the guidance in CG 501 [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 1
Information on the need for mitigation can be obtained from the EPA.
NOTE 2
Exceptionally sensitive locations at high risk of spillage can require dual containment measures.
NOTE 3
The risk of accidental spillage can influence the choice of vegetated drainage system.
2.17.1
Where the estimated probability of a major spillage is assessed at less than 1% annually,
non-mechanical methods of pollution control should be used.
NOTE
Non-mechanical methods of pollution control such as check dams, booms or notch weirs, requiring little
maintenance, are more suitable than mechanical devices such as penstocks or gate valves, which are
more susceptible to vandalism and can become ineffective through lack of use.
2.18
Pollution control devices shall be simple to find, readily accessible from the highway and capable of
being operated easily and quickly.
NOTE
Details of signs to be used to locate pollution control devices are given in CG 501 [Ref 1.N].
2.19
Vegetated drainage systems shall be designed so as not to increase the risk of pollution to downstream
water bodies.

3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
3.
Design of vegetated drainage systems
General
3.1
Vegetated drainage systems shall be integrated into the surrounding landscape.
3.1.1
The design of vegetated drainage systems should enhance and complement the surrounding
landscape beyond the immediate limits of the selected vegetated drainage system.
3.1.2
Features to enhance and complement the surrounding landscape may include:
1)
hedgerows – new hedges and hedgerow trees to link with and enhance existing wildlife corridors;
2)
woodland areas – new native woodland areas to reflect the surrounding landscape character and
provide new habitats;
3)
shrubs/woodland edge – new habitats and enhancement of the surrounding area;
4)
specimen/landmark trees – individual or small groups of trees to provide features within the
landscape; and,
5)
grassland/wildflowers – landscape enhancement and habitat creation.
3.1.3
Where adjacent development proposals are identified, the design of vegetated drainage systems
should exploit opportunities to integrate solutions for restoring or enhancing existing habitats, or
creating new habitats, particularly marginal and wetland habitats and woodland planting.
3.1.4
To assist integration with existing landscape character, local materials and soils should be used for
engineering features and boundary treatments.
NOTE 1
Where abrupt changes in level are required within more confined areas, the sensitive use of stepped
gabions filled with local stone can be very effective.
NOTE 2
Stone-filled gabions can be quickly vegetated by spreading soil on top of them and then seeding.
NOTE 3
The use of appropriate local stone within the gabions can reflect the character of the area.
3.2
Access roads to the vegetated drainage systems shall be designed to accommodate the size and
weight of the relevant maintenance equipment.
3.3
Access roads to the vegetated drainage systems shall be sensitively located to fit with the flow and
pattern of the surrounding landscape.
3.4
Where vegetated drainage systems are to be constructed adjacent to an existing watercourse, a
margin shall be provided to allow for maintenance and access by the riparian owner and land drainage
authority.
NOTE
A margin of up to 8 metres can be required to allow for maintenance and access by the riparian owner
and land drainage authority.
3.4.1
Discussions should be held with the riparian owner and land drainage authority, as this can result in a
reduced margin being permitted.
3.5
The design of vegetated drainage systems shall not prejudice the stability of embankments, cuttings or
other highway structures, by ensuring that the systems contain the water flowing through them.
3.6
The design of vegetated drainage systems shall account for the timing and phasing of seasonal
operations and location of possible storage areas.
Health and safety in design
3.7
Where open bodies of water are proposed to manage runoff, a risk assessment shall be undertaken to
identify all hazards and risks.
3.8
Where a risk assessment identifies a threat to life or serious injury associated with a proposed body of
open water safety, warning signage or other controls shall be provided.

======================================================================
CD 532 Version 0.2.0
3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
3.9
All warning signage deployed adjacent to open bodies of water must comply with The Health and
Safety (Safety Signs and Signals Regulations) 1996 UKSI 1996/341 [Ref 8.N].
3.10
A record of the implementation of safety/warning signage shall be entered into the Overseeing
Organisation's drainage data management system, in accordance with the requirements of CD 535
[Ref 2.N].
3.11
Where, exceptionally, public access to a vegetated treatment system is allowed for the purposes of
amenity or recreational use, water levels adjacent to the pond edge shall be shallow and the slopes
gently graded.
3.12
Access routes for authorised personnel shall deliver a safe working environment.
3.13
Where there is a risk of unauthorised entry to a vegetated drainage system, the design shall
incorporate appropriate security fencing and secured access.
NOTE
Secured access can be provided using retractable and lockable metal bollards concreted into the
entrance.
3.13.1
Fencing around vegetated drainage systems should be designed to prevent public access.
3.13.2
Public access to vegetated drainage systems that can contain standing water should be avoided
because of their role in the treatment and control of highway runoff.
3.13.3
The use of thorny plants, surrounding the vegetated drainage system, combined with low fences or
walls and a planted narrow fringe, may be used as a boundary deterrent.
3.13.4
Security fencing should be designed to be unobtrusive and child-proof, and facilitate movement of
wildlife.
3.14
Where ponds are proposed to be raised above existing land, they must comply with the requirements of
the UKPGA 1975/23 [Ref 6.N].
Swales
3.15
Swales shall be designed for a 5-year, 24-hour event, and checked against a 10-year event.
NOTE 1
A description of a swale and its characteristics is given in Appendix B.
NOTE 2
Swales represent an effective pollution control measure which, even if insufficient for all the treatment
requirements in themselves, can provide significant primary treatment prior to secondary systems such
as ponds or wetlands.
NOTE 3
The potential that swales have to trap suspended solids can reduce the frequency of major
maintenance on downstream systems.
3.16
The velocity of flow in swales shall not exceed 0.25 m/sec for the 5-year, 24-hour event.
NOTE
Swales provide the most effective water treatment when residence times are long and flow is slow.
3.17
The longitudinal slope of a swale shall not exceed 6.25% (1 in 16).
3.17.1
The longitudinal slope should be less than 2% (1 in 50).
NOTE 1
Residence time is best extended by increasing flow width and length but can also be increased through
the incorporation of check dams and depressions.
NOTE 2
For pollutant removal, longer swales are beneficial, although wider swales can compensate for lack of
depth.
3.18
Swales shall be designed without any abrupt changes in vertical or horizontal direction.
NOTE
Gentle changes in shape and form create more attractive features that are easier to maintain.
3.18.1
Swales should be located as close to the road as possible, where flow rates are slowest.
NOTE
Swales are well suited to areas where drainage from the road flows over the edge.

CD 532 Version 0.2.0
3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
3.18.2
Where it is necessary to channel water from a piped flow to a swale, a flow spreader should be used.
NOTE
The use of a flow spreader reduces the risk of rivulets or channels occurring, as these can reduce the
treatment effectiveness of the swale.
3.19
Where ground conditions allow, the design shall include a vertical component to the flow to enhance
rates of settlement and infiltration.
NOTE 1
A vertical component to the flow, allowing discharge to ground, is possible in cases where subsoils are
permeable.
NOTE 2
Although the majority of swales have a gradient unsuited to containing a major spillage, designing the
lowest part of the swale with a shallower gradient and a surrounding berm can improve a swale's
capacity to contain a spillage event.
3.20
Swales shall be integrated into the general landscape of the highway, incorporating existing and
proposed landscape elements such as trees or hedges.
NOTE
Swales can be incorporated in the design of an interchange or in a road realignment, so that the water
from the carriageway flows into swales.
3.21
The design of swales shall incorporate a dense and even grass sward consisting of species with a
combination of rapid establishment and recovery, some salt tolerance and tolerance of wet conditions
and periodic inundation.
3.21.1
The grass in swales should be recommended species such as perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne)
and creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera).
3.21.2
Where salt tolerant species are required, salt tolerant cultivars of fescue species (Festuca spp.) or rush
species (e.g. Juncus spp.) may be used.
3.22
The grass height of the swale shall be at least twice the depth of water to be treated in a 5-year,
24-hour event and between 100 mm and 200 mm.
NOTE
Grass shorter than 100 mm cannot treat flows from a 5-year, 24-hour event and grass taller than 200
mm has a tendency to be flattened.
3.23
Seeding to establish vegetation of the swale shall be uniform and carried out early in the construction
process as soon as soils are ready, and in the late summer/autumn (August to November).
3.23.1
Where quick establishment is required, turf laying may be used in the design to prevent the creation of
rills in swales.
3.23.2
Geotextiles may be employed to prevent erosion of swales in early stages or as temporary measures in
advance of seeding, but are not to be relied on in the long term as they can degrade.
Ditches
3.24
Ditches shall consist of earth channels lined with a native grass species (or combination of species), in
order to provide resilience to flow erosion.
NOTE 1
Possible locations for ditches are along the edge of the road, along the top of cuttings or at the toe of
embankments.
NOTE 2
A typical section of a ditch is shown in Figure 3.24N2.

3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
Figure 3.24N2 Ditch section
3.25
Ditches shall have a minimum of 35 mm of topsoil.
3.26
The value of X shown in Figure 3.24N2 shall not exceed 1.
3.27
The dimension l2 shown on Figure 3.24N2 shall be at least 500 mm.
3.28
The dimensions l1 and l3 shown on Figure 3.24N2 shall be at least 300 mm.
3.28.1
Where ditches are located alongside the road, they may be designed to convey the runoff from the
carriageway as well as that from any adjacent cutting slope.
3.28.2
Ditches should be located where they can fully intercept the flow from the natural catchments adjacent
to the road.
3.29
Surface water runoff from adjacent land shall be managed in accordance with the requirements given in
CD 522 [Ref 3.N].
3.30
Ditches shall be positioned so that surface water does not contribute to slope instability.
3.30.1
Ditches may be located at the top of the cuttings to avoid potential erosion of the slope by surface water.
NOTE
Suitable measures to reduce the risk of slope instability can include geotechnical stabilisation of the
slope or locating the ditch at road level.
3.31
Ditches shall be sized for conditions at their locality.
NOTE
The size of ditches can be calculated using Manning's equation.
3.31.1
A check on the design of the ditch should be carried out at intermediate locations.
3.32
Where intermediate conditions are checked and the size of ditch is found to be inadequate, the
gradients shall be adjusted accordingly.
NOTE
Intermediate locations in ditches can include lengths where flow rates are smaller and gradients are
flatter.
3.32.1
Where conditions in a ditch are found to vary along its length, the required size of ditch may vary
accordingly.
3.33
Where Manning's equation is used for the design of new ditches and where a maintenance programme
is to be put in place, a value of 0.050 for the Manning's roughness coefficient, n, shall be used.
3.34
The minimum design gradient for ditches shall be 0.2% (1/500) to ensure flow conveyance in flat areas.
3.35
To achieve stability and high flow capacity, the cross-sectional shape of ditches shall be trapezoidal.

3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
3.36
Where space allows, existing ditches shall be widened, their slopes slackened and emergent reed-type
vegetation introduced to create a linear system, resembling a natural stream.
NOTE
Where pools and areas of reed can be incorporated, that can have added treatment benefit.
3.36.1
A section of piped drain may be replaced with an open ditch or swale, particularly if a form of spillage
containment is to be introduced.
3.37
When designing ditches, the long-term drainage characteristics of environmentally sensitive soils, such
as peat bogs, shall be preserved.
NOTE
Ditches located in certain environmentally sensitive soils can lead to environmental and ecological
impacts beyond the immediate vicinity of the ditch.
3.38
Where retrofitting of vegetated drainage systems is proposed, the hydraulic performance of the whole
drainage system shall not increase the risk of flooding.
Basins
3.39
The size of a basin shall be determined by the catchment area draining to it.
NOTE 1
A description of a basin and its characteristics is given in Appendix B and a typical plan is shown in
Figure 3.39N1.
Figure 3.39N1 Plan view of a basin (reproduced from CIRIA)
NOTE 2
Figure 3.39N1 is reproduced from CIRIA C753 [Ref 9.N].
3.40
The basin shall be designed to accept the first 10 mm of a storm without over-topping.
3.40.1
The catchment draining to any one basin should be between two and ten hectares.
3.40.2
A narrow trench-like basin may be used for smaller catchments.
3.40.3
More than one basin may be used for larger catchments.
3.41
The basin shall be designed to empty within 72 hours from all events with an annual exceedence
probability of more than 1%, plus an allowance for climate change effects.
3.42
Where the basin is designed to allow infiltration, it shall have a level base, sited at least 1.2 m above
the highest recorded groundwater level.

======================================================================
CD 532 Version 0.2.0
3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
NOTE 1
A basin designed to allow infiltration is known as an infiltration basin.
NOTE 2
A separation of at least 1.2 m between the base of the basin and the highest recorded groundwater
level is necessary to ensure that the filter layer is not saturated and that water percolates through at a
reasonable speed.
NOTE 3
A basin that is designed to prevent infiltration is known as a detention basin.
3.43
The basin inlet shall be designed to prevent scouring of the basin.
3.43.1
Rip rap or flow spreaders may be included to prevent scouring of the basin.
3.44
Where space permits, the first flush shall be isolated in a smaller basin and a second basin used for
attenuation.
NOTE
Without any control to capture the sediment, basins can act as sources of pollutants rather than sinks
where subsequent storms cause scouring of suspended solids, which are then released by
over-topping to the receiving waters.
3.45
Where the basin is designed to allow infiltration, the design shall allow for easy access for removal and
replacement of the filter material, either at predetermined major maintenance intervals or following an
accidental spillage.
3.46
Where the basin is designed to allow infiltration and the risk of accidental spillage requires containment,
the highway runoff shall be passed through a containment area prior to discharge into the basin.
3.47
The design of the basin shall utilise the layout and form of the surrounding environment to minimise
materials use and visual impact.
3.48
Where existing basins have a negative visual impact on the landscape they shall be remediated.
NOTE
The construction of carefully designed low mounds in conjunction with strategic planting can provide
screening for passing road users.
3.48.1
The grass in basins should be recommended species such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and
creeping bent (Agrostis stolonifera).
3.48.2
Where salt tolerant species are required, salt tolerant cultivars of fescue species (Festuca spp.) or rush
species (e.g. Juncus spp.) may be used.
Ponds
3.49
The size of a pond shall be determined by the catchment area draining to it.
3.49.1
The pond depth should be between 0.5 m and 2 m with a permanent water depth of at least 0.5 m.
NOTE 1
A description of a pond and its characteristics is given in Appendix B and a typical plan is shown in
Figure 3.49N1.

NOTE 2
Figure 3.49N1 is reproduced from CIRIA C753 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE 3
For a given volume of storage, shallow ponds are better than deep ones in terms of pollutant removal
efficiency.
Requirements for attenuation of highway runoff
3.50
Where a pond is designed to attenuate highway runoff, it shall have sufficient capacity to retain the
runoff from all events with an annual exceedence probability of more than 1%, plus an allowance for
climate change effects.
NOTE 1
A pond designed primarily to attenuate highway runoff is known as a retention pond.
NOTE 2
For guidance on climate change allowances see LA 113 [Ref 7.N].
3.51
Where a pond is designed to attenuate highway runoff, it shall be located outside flood zone 3.
NOTE 1
Advice on flood zones can be obtained from the local land drainage authority, who can advise on any
history of local flooding and whether the relevant EPA is to be consulted.
NOTE 2
Advice on the risks of damage to habitats and species associated with an increased rate of surface
runoff from the road into sensitive receiving waters can be obtained from the relevant EPA.
3.52
The local land drainage authority shall be consulted about both pond capacities and discharge rates,
and agreement reached with them.

CD 532 Version 0.2.0
3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
3.53
Any requirements that arise as part of the agreement with the local land drainage authority shall be
integrated into the drainage design.
NOTE 1
Land drainage authorities are able, if they wish, to stipulate maximum discharge rates as a condition of
the consent needed for the construction of the outfall, provided that the requirement is reasonable.
NOTE 2
Consents from land drainage authorities cannot be unreasonably withheld as highway authorities have
powers to drain highways as described in Section 100 of the UKPGA 1980/66 [Ref 4.N].
3.54
The rate of discharge from the pond shall be managed to ensure that the water has a slow flow-path
with a generous retention time.
3.54.1
The rate of of discharge from a pond may be achieved by means of a small diameter pipe, an orifice or
a flow control device.
Requirements for treatment of highway runoff
3.55
Where the highway runoff is assessed as having a high risk of pollution and requiring mitigation, ponds
shall be designed to treat runoff.
NOTE 1
A pond designed primarily to treat highway runoff is known as a sedimentation pond.
NOTE 2
The primary treatment function of a pond is to allow suspended solids to settle out of the highway runoff
prior to its discharge into the receiving watercourse.
NOTE 3
By retaining the highway runoff and only permitting a controlled discharge, the available dilution by the
receiving water body can be increased, thereby reducing the pollutant concentrations in the receiving
water body.
3.55.1
Where the available land is limited, incorporation of by-pass facilities may still allow the first 10 mm of
runoff to be fully treated through settlement.
3.56
For optimum treatment performance the design of the pond shall create a long, slow, flow path,
providing a generous residence time, but avoiding stagnant areas.
NOTE
Long ponds, with the inlet at the opposite end from the outlet can provide a generous residence time.
3.56.1
Where space for ponds is restricted, baffles close to the inlet or outlet, or islands, or long or irregular
shorelines should be designed to increase the flow path from inlet to outlet of the pond.
3.56.2
Direct pathways or channels between the inlet and outlet of the pond should be avoided.
3.56.3
The design of the pond should not cause the flow speed to increase in localised areas, as this reduces
the treatment effectiveness of the pond, by increasing the risk that resuspension of particles can occur
during intense storms.
3.57
The design of the inlet shall allow water to enter without scouring the pond surface.
3.58
Where ponds are designed to act as a form of spillage containment, the outlet control system shall be
easily accessible and safely maintainable.
3.58.1
Where risk of spillage is not high (annual probabilities less than 1%), low maintenance control systems
such as sandbags or a notched weir should be incorporated into the design.
NOTE 1
In emergencies, the quicker control devices can be used, the lower the risk of pollution.
NOTE 2
There is a risk that devices such as penstocks can be more susceptible to vandalism and deteriorate
over time due to prolonged periods without use.
Requirements for pond integration into the landscape
3.59
New pond land-forms shall reflect the overall character shape and scale of the prevailing topography.
3.60
Geometric shapes and steep uniform banks shall be avoided.
NOTE
Curvilinear or indented pond shapes that 'marry in' smoothly with adjoining contours, create more
interesting and attractive features, as shown in Figure 3.60N.

Vegetation for ponds
3.63
Gently sloping shelves shall be incorporated within ponds to provide conditions for emergent and
marginal vegetation.
3.63.1
Vegetation may be planted close to the inlet of the pond to promote sedimentation.
NOTE 1
A vegetation band installed across the entire width of a pond can enhance retention and residence
times.
NOTE 2
A submerged berm in a pond for the vegetation to grow on can mitigate any risk of failure of the
vegetation due to low water levels.
NOTE 3
Allowing margins to develop with vegetation where land meets water can create an area for wildlife.
3.64
Plants selected for ponds shall be appropriate for the climate, water depth and variations in depth of
water.
3.64.1
Where planting in ponds is proposed, species should be selected from those given in Table 3.64.1.

3. Design of vegetated drainage systems
NOTE
A flow spreader can assist in producing an even flow, as can the use of stone pitching to stabilise the
entry channel.
3.71.1
Where groundwater levels are high, groundwater flows may be utilised to keep the wetland moist,
provided that arrangements for introducing the groundwater prevent any possibility of contamination of
the aquifer by pollutants from the wetland.
3.72
Where a wetland is designed to act as a spillage containment facility, the outfall shall be designed so
that spills can be contained, either mechanically, by a penstock or similar, or by emergency personnel
using sandbags or booms to block a suitable channel.
NOTE
Although the wetland can need to be thoroughly renovated following a serious spillage, this is
considered acceptable for events where the estimated probability is less than 1% annually, or where
the wetland is used as the secondary containment system where dual containment has to be provided.
3.73
When designing a catchment spillage containment system the implication of providing a separate
containment system shall be weighed against the need to renovate a wetland following a spillage
event, and the vulnerability of the receiving water body to such a pollution event.
3.74
Establishment of vegetation species in wetlands shall be from planted rhizome/root stock in the spring.
3.74.1
Vegetation species for wetlands should be selected from those given in Table 3.64.1.
3.75
The design of vegetation planting in wetlands shall be such as to deliver a band of vegetation across
the entire flow path.
3.75.1
Where there is a reliance on vegetation-related removal of metal pollutants, the removal rates given in
Table 3.75.1 may be used to estimate the minimum size of vegetation in wetlands.

Combination of systems
3.76
Where required to maximise the treatment of the highway runoff, and space is restricted, vegetated
drainage systems shall be designed and built as a combination of two or more systems.
NOTE
An example of one such combination of vegetated drainage systems is a system containing a wetland
and a retention pond.
3.77
When designing a combination of vegetated drainage systems the benefits of each constituent system
shall be preserved.

Appendix A. Runoff constituents and treatment processes
Appendix A. Runoff constituents and treatment processes
A1
Suspended solids
Suspended solids are the principal road runoff constituents requiring treatment because of the harmful
physical effect they can have on aquatic habitats. Many of the other potentially harmful constituents of
runoff (heavy metals, organic compounds) are in particulate form or attached to particles which can
accumulate in the water course, leading to chronic pollution. Research FHWA-RD-96-095 Volume I [Ref
11.I] and FHWA-PD-96-032 [Ref 6.I] indicates that typically more than 50% of both metal and organic
contaminants associated with suspended particles are contained within the fraction finer than 63 µ m.
The main removal mechanisms of solids by vegetated systems are due to enhanced settlement through
reduced flow velocities and filtering effects as described in research Humphries & Walker 1994 [Ref
10.I]. Settlement is the main process in very slowly flowing standing water as in ponds and contained
types of inundated wetland. It is not, however, a significant process in swales, infiltration basins and
those wetlands without standing surface water, where there is a through flow and short residence time.
Settlement will be most effective in systems where there is a long residence time or where there are
structures that induce particulate collisions and arrest the flow thereby promoting settlement. 24 hours
is the recommended minimum duration and this should be exceeded where possible. The filtering
process will only take place where there is a significant flow through vegetation, as in swales and
grassed channels, infiltration basins, and open types of wetland without standing surface water.
A2
Heavy metals
As much of the metal content of the runoff is particulate, the principal removal processes within
vegetated systems are the same as for the suspended solids (settlement and filtering). Precipitation
and formation of metal hydroxides and other insoluble compounds can also occur in certain
oxidation/reduction conditions. Vegetated drainage systems such as swales and grassed channels,
wetlands and infiltration basins, and ponds with a vegetation cover will remove heavy metals in the
particulate form either by filtration and/or by settlement. Settlement column studies indicate that, for
runoff from a single storm event, the majority of heavy metal pollutant removal occurs within the first 6
hours. Removal of copper and zinc, the two metals most likely to be present in significant
concentrations, improves if there is up to 24 hours residence time.
Adsorption of metals to soil and vegetation, and assimilation by microbes and plant uptake of soluble
metals, also take place in vegetated systems, but are considered to be of less significance than the
physical processes and are reliant on a relatively long residence time. Plant uptake is dependent on
active vegetative growth and microbial activity on temperature; both are likely to be significantly lower in
the late autumn-winter period and metals may be released on decomposition.
Precipitation of metal oxide solids is a secondary process that removes metals from the runoff water.
Insoluble metal oxides typically form under aerobic conditions in retention systems such as ponds, and
are then precipitated. Aeration of water is therefore an important part of standing/flowing water systems
such as ponds. Precipitation as a removal mechanism may be less in soft water.
There is substantial research evidence Norrstrom & Jack 1998 [Ref 2.I] and Novotney et al 1998 [Ref
3.I] that remobilisation of metals may occur especially with high inputs of sodium chloride into sandy
non-calcareous substrates, due to displacement of the metals by sodium ions. This is caused by the
use of salt as a deicing agent.
A3
Organic constituents
This group contains a wide range of chemicals. Adsorption to suspended solids and subsequent
settlement is a significant removal process for oils and grease. Lighter aromatic fuel additives may
volatilise prior to degradation, in which case prolonged exposure of runoff to the air is beneficial. Other
aromatic compounds such as PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) and PAHs (Polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons) are toxic and may be more persistent, but have a tendency to adsorb to suspended
solids.

CD 532 Version 0.2.0
Appendix A. Runoff constituents and treatment processes
As much of the organic content of the runoff is associated with particles, the principal removal
processes within vegetated systems are the same as for suspended solids (settlement and filtering).
Significant amounts may therefore be removed by settlement processes. Vegetated drainage systems
such as swales and channels, wetlands and infiltration basins, and ponds with a vegetation cover will
remove it in the particulate form.
Biological degradation of oils and grease is relatively slow, taking several days even in ideal conditions.
The biodegradation process is therefore considered to be of less significance in the removal of organic
constituents from runoff than settlement. The process is likely to be of significance, however, in the in
situ degradation of accumulating material. Ponds and wetlands are probably the best systems for such
in situ transformation as they are more likely to support the requisite aerobic microbes.
A4
Nutrients
Nitrogen and phosphorus are usually the primary nutrients of concern to the EPAs, but are not normally
present in significant concentrations in highway runoff, and are therefore not a major consideration for
treatment. Where significant concentrations occur, uptake by vegetation and microbes in vegetated
systems are likely to reduce these concentrations, but only in the growing season. Vegetated systems
sometimes contribute to higher nutrient discharges than are normally associated with road runoff owing
to accumulation and degradation of plant material, but this should be significantly less than other
sources, particularly agriculture.
A5
Sodium chloride and other dissolved constituents
Other than heavy metals and nutrients, the significant dissolved constituent of highway runoff in the UK
is sodium chloride (NaCl), applied as deicing salt. Vegetated systems are unable to reduce
concentrations of common salt to any significant extent. Sodium chloride can cause damage to
vegetation, and can potentially trigger the release of accumulated nutrients and heavy metals adsorbed
to the suspended solids into solution. Where use of deicing salt is likely to be very frequent and the
dilution of runoff by receiving waters is low, either the 'first flush' should be diverted to infiltration
facilities with groundwater protection or only ponds should be used.
A6
The importance of residence time and loading
Residence time (sometimes referred to as retention time, Rt, where Rt = V/Q where Q is the outflow
and V is volume of the system) is the period during which the runoff is retained within the drainage
system. It is probably the overall key design parameter for all treatment systems that depend on the
settlement process (such as ponds and wetlands) for removal of sediment, metals and hydrocarbons.
Permanent pool storage capacity (min 10-15%), hydraulic gradient <1%, length-width ratios >3:1,
uniform cross-section, flow path (zig-zag), flow arrest structures (submerged islands/weirs, vegetation
across flow), and outfall structures are often cited (see RCHR 98/7 [Ref 9.I]) as important design and
influencing features. Where appropriate, these apply to separate, hybrid or combination systems.
Hydraulic loading has also become recognised as an important factor, where the efficiency of the
treatment systems declines with increased loading. Flow rates under storm conditions are also
significant in remobilisation of sediment and bypass structures are frequently recommended.
A7
Treatment processes
Table A.1 summarises the principal treatment processes in each system.

Appendix B. Description of vegetated drainage systems
Appendix B. Description of vegetated drainage systems
Table B.1 gives a description of vegetated drainage systems.
Table B.1 Description of vegetated drainage systems
Name of
vegetated
system
Description
Treatment functions
Swale
Shallow grassed open channel;
deeper and wider than grassed surface
water channel;
well-suited to areas where the road is
on a gently sloping embankment as the
embankment slopes can be designed
to be part of the swale.
Primary function: Slow the flow of
water to provide filtration.
Additional functions: conveyance and
water storage.
Particularly effective in controlling
pollution when there is a degree of
infiltration to the subgrade, or where
residence times are long and flow
velocities are low.
Can be used to reduce spillage risk by
the addition of check dams, which can
also attenuate flow.
Can operate as the first form of
attenuation and treatment in a drainage
system.
Ditch
Open trench, normally with battered
side slopes.
Lined or unlined.
Usually parallel to carriageway at the
back of the verge or remote when
associated with the earthwork.
Also Intercepts and conveys surface
water runoff from the carriageway,
earthworks and/or adjacent land.
Settlement of suspended solids and
filtration (less effective than swales).
Unlined ditches can allow infiltration of
runoff through soil and vegetation,
particularly where residence times are
long.
Lined ditches can act as containment
basins if located between the road
drain and receiving watercourses.
Where unlined ditches are located
above permeable strata, there is a risk
that highway runoff will infiltrate and
potentially contaminate any underlying
aquifer. There is also the possibility
that high groundwater levels will fill the
ditch.
Detention basin
Shallow depression that detains storm
water flows as temporary storage
before the water is directed to a
surface water outfall;
Does not allow infiltration to ground
and can be lined to prevent this.
Allows suspended solids to settle out of
the runoff prior to its discharge into the
receiving surface watercourse or
groundwater;
Can be used to receive the first flush
flows and to hold and treat these, with
the rest of the flow bypassing the basin
to other systems;
Stores and treats water, and can
therefore provide a degree of risk
reduction for both flooding and pollution
downstream.

Name of

system
Description
Treatment functions
Infiltration basin
Shallow depression that detains storm
water flows as temporary storage and
allows water to percolate through a
permeable base, often comprising a
filter layer, such as gravel.
The water may be directed to a surface
water outfall, or it may continue to
percolate through to groundwater.
Allows suspended solids to settle out of
the runoff prior to its discharge into the
receiving surface watercourse or
groundwater;
Can be used to receive the first flush
flows and to hold and treat these, with
the rest of the flow bypassing the basin
to other systems;
Store and treats water, and can
therefore provide a degree of risk
reduction for both flooding and pollution
downstream;
Not suitable for retaining accidental
spillages, because of the difficulty in
cleaning them, and should be sited
downstream of an appropriate spill
containment device, unless this risk is
perceived to be low.
Wetland
Shallow depression or low lying level
ground that is permanently saturated
by surface water or groundwater so
that it is able to support aquatic and/or
semi-aquatic (emergent) vegetation
such as reed swamps, marshes, or
bogs, depending on the degree of
saturation and inundation.
Primary flow is across or close to the
surface of the growing medium and
through the above ground parts of the
plants.
Effective in the removal of suspended
solids and associated heavy metals
through the physical processes of
settlement and filtration;
Provided there is a relatively long
residence time (24 hours or more),
adsorption and microbial degradation
and biological uptake of metals and
nutrients can occur;
Well-suited to treatment of highway
runoff as it is able to deal with the high
suspended solid loads in highway
runoff. However it needs to be
designed so that it remains sufficiently
wet in the summer months.
Retention pond
Pond that generally retains some water
at all times.
Can have permeable base or banks.
Primarily designed to attenuate flows
by accepting large inflows, but
discharging slowly.
Can also treat water by allowing
suspended solids to settle out.
Sedimentation
pond
Pond that generally retains some water
at all times.
Usually has an impermeable base.
Designed primarily to treat water by
allowing suspended solids to settle out.
Will also attenuate flows by accepting
large inflows, but discharging slowly.
