Introduction
Introduction
Background
The main purpose of providing signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres is to guide drivers to
their intended destination during the latter stage of their journey, particularly where the destination or
entrance could be difficult to find.
Traffic signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres can be perceived by businesses as useful
marketing tools but this is not the purpose for which they are provided.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

2. Qualifying requirements
2.
Qualifying requirements
Eligibility requirements
2.1
Signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres shall be provided only where there are specific, local
traffic management or safety reasons.
NOTE 1
The purpose of signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres is to guide visitors to their intended
destination along the most appropriate route during the latter stage of their journey.
NOTE 2
Traffic signs are not used as a means to circumvent planning control of advertisements, nor as a
substitute for promotional material.
2.1.1
Signing should not extend more than 5 miles from the destination (as measured along a route) for:
1) a retail destination with more than 70,000 square metres of retail space; or,
2) an exhibition centre with more than 10,000 square metres of exhibition space.
2.1.2
Signing should not extend more than 2 miles from the destination (as measured along a route) for:
1) a retail destination with less than 70,000 square metres of retail space; or,
2) an exhibition centre with less than 10,000 square metres of exhibition space.
2.2
Retail destinations or exhibition centres shall only be signed from motorways if:
1) a retail destination has over 70,000 square metres of retail space (excluding public areas, access
roads and car parks); or,
2) an exhibition centre has over 10,000 square metres of exhibition space.
2.3
Only standard directional signing as prescribed by TSRGD SI2016 No.362 [Ref 3.N] shall be used for
new or replacement signs for retail destinations and exhibition centres.
2.3.1
Retail destinations and exhibition centres should not be shown on route confirmatory signs.
NOTE 1
Guidance on the design of traffic signs is contained in TSM Chapter 7 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE 2
Guidance on the use of directional signing generally is contained in LTN 1/94 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE 3
As a general principle, it is assumed that the owner or operator advertises the retail destination or
exhibition centre, its opening times, the location and its accessibility by road and public transport,
through the appropriate publicly accessible channels.
2.4
Traffic signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres shall not be provided along a route, where a
retail destination or exhibition centre can be reached by following existing directional signs along that
route from the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network to a location which appears on the postal
address of the retail destination or exhibition centre.
2.4.1
Traffic signs to retail destinations and exhibition centres may be provided along a route where the
location is signed from multiple junctions and there is a need to identify the appropriate junction to
direct visitors to the destination.
NOTE 1
Retail destinations and exhibition centres identifiable with towns or cities signed on a motorway or all
purpose trunk road are not normally signed on the motorway or all purpose trunk road unless specific
route guidance is needed.
NOTE 2
Figure E/2.4.1N2 depicts an example scenario, where those seeking Any Town Exhibition Centre and
approaching from the south could find the destination by following existing directional signs to Any
Town. However, this would not be the case for those approaching from the north, where exhibition
centre signing could be appropriate (subject to other factors).

Figure 2.4.1N2 Illustrative network example
2.5
Traffic signing shall not be provided for retail destinations or exhibition centres which have directional
advertisements adjacent to the highway / road.
2.6
There shall be consistency and continuity of signing across highway / road authority boundaries.
2.6.1
To agree consistent arrangements for cross-boundary signing, and to provide consistent signing across
highway / road authority boundaries, the signing strategy for a destination should be developed after:
1) internal consultation with managers of affected routes;
2) external consultation with adjoining highway / road authorities.
Safe accommodation of signing
2.7
Retail destination and exhibition centre signing shall be allowed only where it can be safely
accommodated at the roadside.
NOTE
It can be difficult to accommodate retail destination and exhibition centre signing because of physical
constraints or the number of other destinations requiring signing in the area, which includes local
destinations and regional destinations.

Retail destination or exhibition centre signs
3.1
Individual retail establishments shall not be named on a traffic sign.
3.1.1
Where appropriate for traffic management or safety reasons, the collective name of a retail destination
or exhibition centre may be used on the directional traffic sign.
3.1.2
The collective name of a retail destination or exhibition centre should be concise and easy to assimilate.
NOTE
Examples of collective names include 'Cheshire Oaks' or 'N.E.C.'.
3.2
A collective name shall only be used on a directional traffic sign for a retail destination if the collective
name is included in the postal address of the individual establishments within the retail destination.
3.3
Where there is no collective name or the collective name does not meet the criteria in this section,
generic names for retail destinations or exhibition centres shall be used on a traffic sign.
NOTE
Examples of generic names include 'Local shops', 'Shopping centre', 'Retail park', 'Supermarket',
'Exhibition Centre' etc.

Review of existing signs
Not fit for purpose
4.1
Where a sign to a retail destination or exhibition centre is not fit for purpose, the sign shall only be
replaced where the owners of the retail destination or exhibition centre submit up to date information in
accordance with the eligibility requirements in this document.
4.2
Where the owner of the retail destination or exhibition centre fails to provide up to date information, or if
the up to date information fails to demonstrate eligibility, then the retail destination or exhibition centre
shall no longer be signed.
4.3
Where a sign to a retail destination or exhibition centre is removed and was part of a series of signs to a
destination, i.e. a continuity sign, then all directions to the retail destination or leisure facility shall also
be removed.
Route alteration
4.4
Where a route is to be altered to the extent that it affects the signing eligibility of a retail destination or
exhibition centre (such as a bypass increasing signed route mileage), the scheme responsible for the
alterations shall contact the retail destination or exhibition centre to discuss ongoing eligibility on the
altered route.
4.5
Where the retail destination or exhibition centre remains eligible, the installation and maintenance costs
of the new signs on trunk roads shall be met by the scheme responsible for altering the route.
Closed retail destinations or exhibition centres
4.6
Where a retail destination or exhibition centre has permanently closed, signs directing road users to
such locations shall not be permitted to remain.
4.6.1
Where the sign only directs traffic to the closed retail destination or exhibition centre, it should be
removed.
4.6.2
Where the sign directs traffic to other locations as well as the closed location, it should be replaced or
have the appropriate legend(s) covered up.
