Introduction
Introduction
Background
The design of temporary traffic management differs from the design of permanent features. While
requirements and advice documents (RADs) relating to the latter identify an end requirement which
needs to be met, aspects relating to temporary traffic management identify aspects which need to be
considered within the scheme specific risk assessment along with an indication of what is considered
reasonably practicable on the majority of the UK network.
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] includes basic requirements for changeovers and crossovers design;
however, feedback from designers and contractors has highlighted the need for additional advice to
provide consistency in the design and layout of crossovers on dual carriageway all-purpose roads and
motorways. The application of the recommended design rules should ensure appropriate locations,
and satisfactory horizontal and vertical design. A requirement of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] is that
crossover location, and more particularly crossover length, is not to be dictated by using an existing
central reserve gap that is too short for the design speed. A well-designed crossover will minimise
vehicle braking and queuing, therefore reducing the risk of nose-to-tail accidents upstream.
The current drafting rules for RADs require the removal of information and advice not related to a
requirement. This has led to the omission of advice currently in TA 92/03. Until this can be incorporated
into other documents, such as TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N], TA 92/03 will be available in the DMRB
archive.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

Bend
A horizontal radius in the existing road alignment.
Changeover
A change of lanes introduced to divert traffic within an existing
carriageway, including the hard shoulder. A changeover is normally
associated with temporary works where one or more lanes are
closed.
NOTE: Changeover may occur after the traffic has been merged into
fewer lanes than the permanent situation.
Crossover
Where one or more lanes on a dual carriageway or motorway are
diverted onto the opposing carriageway. This is normally where a
contraflow situation is required to carry out works on the primary
carriageway.
NOTE 1: Crossover length is shown in Figure A.1.
NOTE 2: A second crossover is needed to return to the primary
carriageway. Crossover site is the paved area within the central
reserve used as part of the crossover.
Curve
The crossover "S" shape.
Entry curve
The first curve of the "S" shape.
Exit curve
The second curve of the "S" shape.
Non-assisting
Superelevation that assists traffic in the non-works situation but
adversely affects traffic through a crossover curve.
Road works scheme
Any planned maintenance, construction or inspection activity which
requires the placing of temporary traffic management equipment on
a road. It also covers street works.
NOTE: Temporary layouts not relating to construction etc; activities,
in place for up to six months use temporary signs which are within
scope of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N]; temporary layouts in place for
more than six months are signed using design rules for permanent
signs

Design requirements for road works
2.1
The design and operation of all road works and temporary layouts shall meet with the requirements and
guidance in Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 ( TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N]) and relevant legislation.
NOTE 1
Appendix A to D contain supplementary information and guidance for designers to use within scheme
specific designs to meet this requirement.
NOTE 2
While the basic principles of crossover and changeover design are covered in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N]
there are locations on the motorway and all purpose trunk road network where designers, including
those designing a road scheme being constructed and also temporary traffic management (TTM)
designers, need to undertake a more detailed engineering assessment to ensure that a safe crossover
or changeover design can be adopted. This document gives details of design parameters and
considerations for changeovers and crossovers which would meet the requirements of TSM Chapter 8
[Ref 4.N].
NOTE 3
The safety requirements for road users interacting with the works and road workers involved with the
installation of the temporary traffic management or involved with construction activities (including
maintenance and inspection activities) are identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE 4
During road works the safety requirements for both road users and road workers are required to be
based on the principle of 'As Low as Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP).
2.2
Safety risk assessments shall follow the principles identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] for all affected
populations.
NOTE
As the design of temporary traffic management and the identification of a safe method of working is the
responsibility of the contractor, no departures from this standard can be granted.
2.3
Any non-compliance with guidance identified in this document shall be supported by a scheme specific
risk assessment.
2.3.1
While the responsibility for the design of safe traffic management in association with adopting a safe
method of working remains with the contractor, the impact of the proposed TTM on traffic flow or other
network affect should be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation (as indicated in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref
4.N]).

Appendix A. Crossovers
A1
General
In addition to the maintenance of safety, the design of a crossover is a balance between available
locations, economical construction cost, environmental impact and convenience to road users. As
crossovers form part of a temporary and often changing situation, attention should be given to the
possibility that the exact nature of any design may be affected by unplanned changes or events.
The basis of the design recommendations in this document allows for a reduction in normal driver
comfort within the design while maintaining acceptable limits for sideways acceleration. Temporary
traffic management arrangements should be prominently signed and consequently road users should
be aware of any road layout they are approaching. In this situation drivers are able to tolerate a tighter
geometric design than can be accepted in a non-roadworks situation on the assumption that the
chosen design speed is consistent with, but not necessarily the same as, any temporary reduced
mandatory speed limit.
New construction within the central reserve should normally be retained for future use, unless there is
justification for removal at the completion of the works e.g. where retention creates a safety hazard or
affects the environment.
A2
Re-use of existing crossover sites
Prior to re-use of an existing crossover site a design assessment is required by TSM Chapter 8 [Ref
4.N], even where it has operated without problems in the past. There is no requirement to assess any
existing crossover site until plans arise to re-use it.
A3
New roads and network improvement schemes
The design of new roads or network improvement schemes would not normally provide crossover sites
for the purposes of future maintenance works. However, part of the design process for a new road or
improvement scheme assesses future maintenance needs. This document should be used when
identifying lengths of central reserve which could be designed to contain the minimum of equipment to
allow for the construction of crossovers, at a later date. In all cases the maintaining organisation should
be consulted.
A4
Construction records
As-built drawings for the works should indicate the assumed design speed used in the design of a
crossover. This will assist at a later date when crossover sites are assessed for potential re-use. These
should be included in the Health and Safety file (see relevant CDM Regulations CDM 2015 [Ref 1.N])
plus any as-built data requirements for the relevant Overseeing Organisations.

B1
Design speed and speed limits
Any temporary mandatory speed limit to be used for a scheme should be determined by reference to
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N]. The design speed to be adopted for a crossover is related to either the
temporary reduced mandatory speed limit or the nature of the works which would naturally reduce the
speed of traffic passing through a crossover.
The selection of design speed is not affected by the status of the crossover site as permanent or
temporary.
It is not acceptable to attempt to reduce costs by selecting a crossover design speed and corresponding
temporary speed limit lower than TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] identifies as being required. In the case of
pre-existing crossover sites, shown by assessment to be sub-standard, the cost implications of
enhancement to that required given the likely future use should be assessed as part of the design.
It is recommended that the speed limit at crossovers reflect any mandatory reduced speed limit in place
throughout the works; however, TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] identifies that it is undesirable to set the
speed limit along the whole length of the schemes based on the conditions along only a short length of
the schemes. If a crossover cannot be designed for the prevailing temporary reduced mandatory speed
limit it should be designed for an appropriate lower design speed and if needed for road user safety the
temporary reduced mandatory speed limit may be further reduced at the crossover.
Reducing the design speed by one step (Table D.1) is preferable to two steps, and a two-step reduction
should only be permitted in extreme cases where the costs of adopting a one-step reduction remain
disproportionately high. Reductions of more than two steps are not suitable as the reduced standard
will be insufficiently conspicuous to approaching traffic to transit the crossover safely or adjust their
speed to obey such low speed limits without unacceptably reduction in capacity.
The advice of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] normally recommends that a mandatory speed limit is
undesirable where the length of the speed limit is less than 800m. However, at a crossover the length
of any locally lower mandatory speed limit will normally be less than 800m. In the case of an additional
reduction of 10 mph this is normally acceptable as the advance signing of the crossover and the need
to change steering input tends to make the lower limit self-enforcing. Any reduced speed limit for a
crossover at the start of a contraflow will apply to all lanes on the approach to the crossover until the
point the contraflow starts. If needed for a return crossover the start of any limit would be at the end of
the contra-flow and start of the crossover. This ensures that the same speed limit applies in both
directions over the length of the contraflow and the reduced limit applies to traffic in the primary direction
only. The design and choice of any speed enforcement technology will need to accommodate any
change in mandatory speed limit through a crossover. The requirements of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N]
means it is not acceptable to omit the reduced mandatory speed limit for the sole reason of adopting a
single section of an average speed camera system to cover the scheme before and after the crossover.
Where the design of the works provides the full stopping sight distance on the approach to the
crossover, the approach signing meets the recommended sizes and visibility distance in TSM Chapter
8 [Ref 4.N] and the capacity of the crossover is sufficient to avoid queuing traffic on the approach, then
the extra reduction in mandatory speed limit may be dispensed where there is up to a one-step
reduction in design speed. If the same limitations apply then a 10 mph extra reduction in mandatory
speed limit may be implemented where there is a two-step reduction design speed. The adoption of
either option may depend on the wider design of the schemes and will need to be justified in the
scheme specific risk assessment required by TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N].
B2
Design philosophy
The design philosophy adopted for crossovers is based on providing acceptable horizontal radii for an
"ideal" crossover and where various adverse factors exist, reducing the risk by increasing the radii in
steps to continue to provide an acceptable layout. Appendix D gives design tables to determine the

curve radii to be used for a particular situation. The tables do not identify a specific requirement; they
can be used to identify if TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] requires a lower provision to be justified in the
schemes specific risk assessment.
B3
Horizontal alignment
Horizontal curvature on the existing carriageway, i.e. a bend at the proposed crossover location, may
cause difficulties in the design. It is preferable that the radius of curvature of the entry curve into the
crossover is the same as that of the exit curve. The effect of any existing bends on the ability to provide
this has to be assessed, see Table D.3.
The provision of equal entry and exit curve radii poses no difficulty if the carriageway is straight.
Any existing horizontal bend has an adverse effect on the curves forming the crossover. An existing
right hand bend results in a tighter entry radius than would be the case with a straight road. Similarly an
existing left hand bend causes tightening on the exit curve.
An existing bend may also effectively form a third curve either before entry to the crossover or on the
exit. Although this occurs entirely on the existing carriageway, it will cause a 'triple' bend to be created.
Introducing a third change of direction for drivers to negotiate is undesirable.
Where a bend on the approach to a crossover has superelevation in any direction, the radius of the
crossover entry curve should be increased in accordance with Table D.3 to allow a greater margin of
safety when drivers are already experiencing different sideways forces before entering the crossover.
Where the entry and/or exit curves are located partly on the existing carriageway and partly on the
central reserve there may be a change of vehicle sideways acceleration. Crossover radii should be
increased in accordance with Tables D.3 and D.4 when acceleration changes occur on any curve. The
extreme case is a change from assisting superelevation to adverse camber.
An extreme case is where the existing bend is of the same hand and its radius is approaching the
design limit for the radius of the entry curve. In this case the entry curve approximates so closely to the
radius of the existing bend that, effectively, no 'lateral shift' can take place. In these circumstances the
crossover should be sited elsewhere.
The use of unequal curve radii through the crossover is undesirable and it should be avoided, but with
one exception: where a right-hand bend exists, the radius of the exit curve can be greater than that of
the entry curve, provided that the crossover will only be used in this direction. If the crossover is to be
used later in the other direction then undesirable "tightening" through the crossover would occur. In this
situation the crossover would need to be designed and constructed with equal radii curves.
Alternatively the crossover would need to be reconstructed if used in the reverse direction.
The use of crossovers with equal entry and exit curve radii will result in long crossover lengths if they
are situated on a significant bend in the road and such crossovers will be asymmetric. However, this is
preferred as this will not be particularly noticeable to a driver whereas any change of radii would.
B4
Transition curves
Generally transition curves are not required in the design of a crossover and the 'tightening radius'
effect created is undesirable. However, the lack of a transition curve will increase the impact of narrow
lanes on road user's ability to stay in lane through the crossover. If transitions are not provided for the
reasons identified below, to mitigate this risk delineation via road markings, studs, cones and/or
cylinders would need to be enhanced as identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N].
The use of a transition curve will cause the overall length of the crossover to increase. This will
normally increase the length of the central reserve gap in most designs with a resulting increase in
construction costs.
Where the crossover cannot be better located or designed in accordance with the recommendations of
this document, the use of a transition curve may be required to reduce sideways acceleration or
overturning problems.

Appendix B. Geometric design
B5
Vertical alignment
The vertical alignment to be considered in the design of the crossover is that lying on the vehicle path
for the temporary layout, rather than that of the centreline of the normal carriageway.
The longitudinal vertical curve to be considered is the approximate curve that can be fitted between the
two existing vertical curves, one for each carriageway, allowing for any temporary construction. Figure
B.2 gives an example of fitted curve diagrams for a particular case where the secondary carriageway is
higher than the primary carriageway.
Adverse factors through the crossover has to be assessed due to the effects of the crest curve on the
limits of adhesion or the overturning of large vehicles. See Tables D.3 and D.5.
Any sag curve has to be assessed to avoid an unacceptable reduction in comfort level or distances
illuminated by headlights. See Tables D.3 and D.5.
Taking the fitted curve as shown in Figure C.2, the vertical alignment through the crossover should be
designed to comply with Table D.5.
The affects of a two-way crossovers will need to be included when assessing gradient.
Crossovers should not be located where the downhill gradient exceeds the desirable maximum
reproduced below:
3% Motorways
4% AP Dual Carriageways
Where downhill gradients steeper than these are unavoidable, measures to reduce speed e.g. speed
enforcement cameras, may be required. Downhill gradients may cause undesirable adverse camber
effects (Table D.2) and horizontal radii may need to be increased (Table D.3).
The effect of an uphill gradient on approach to the crossover is generally beneficial. However, if the
uphill gradient or height risen is near to the advice limits for the start of provision of climbing lanes in
CD 109 [Ref 2.N] then traffic throughput may be reduced to unacceptable levels.
B6
Crossfall and height differences between carriageways
The longitudinal alignment should be checked along the centreline of the temporary lanes through the
crossover, including entry and exit curves. The effective alignment along this path will involve both the
existing fitted vertical curve (Figure C.2) and the effects of carriageway crossfall and level differences
between the carriageways. Situations may arise where the gradient of the fitted curve and the crossfall
combine to give an unacceptable resultant value of adverse camber. The resultant value of adverse
camber and downhill fitted gradient is calculated using Table D.2. Along the full S-curve there may be
various different values of resultant adverse camber. The worst value should be determined and
inserted into Table E.3. As gradient will usually vary along the fitted curve, the worst case
instantaneous downhill gradient that occurs along the length of route at which adverse camber is being
considered should be used. Relieving effects of uphill gradients are not taken into account.
The section of road being assessed should have minimum crossfalls to both carriageways wherever
possible. In circumstances where the road falls to the nearside verge of each carriageway, the
crossfalls will form an adverse camber on the curves through the crossover. It will only be in the
circumstances where the road falls towards the central reserve that it will assist with one or both curves
through the crossover.
Whenever possible, the crossover location should have no significant difference in the levels between
the edges of each carriageway across the central reserve.
Where the level of the secondary carriageway is lower than that of the primary carriageway, assuming
a superelevation not greater than 7% is formed, this will normally assist with the entry into the
contraflow section, but will normally create an adverse camber at the exit curve, and the latter case
should be used to determine the horizontal design.

Appendix B. Geometric design
Where the level of the secondary carriageway is greater than that of the primary carriageway, an
adverse camber is formed which should not exceed the resultant values given in Table D.2. This will
generally be the limiting factor when deciding what level difference between the two lanes can be
accepted.
Where a significant difference of level between the two carriageways exists and there is no alternative
location for the crossover, additional design and construction may be necessary, possibly in the form of
an overlay to raise the level of one of the carriageways. The fitted curve can then be adjusted.
The side profiles of drainage channels can cause adverse camber to increase while travelling through
the crossover entry or exit curve. Where such drainage items are present then the crossover should be
located and designed so that any profile does not adversely affect the design and performance of the
crossover. Where this is not possible, the termination of channels and use of alternative drainage
methods is advised. The elimination of adverse conditions by filling with wearing course material is not
recommended, unless a suitable bond can be guaranteed, because a loss of wearing course filler may
create a hazard.
Linear drainage channels systems affect both the lateral and longitudinal alignment levels and need to
be assessed under both categories when using Table D.2.

Rollover
The worst case for rollover is when changing from a 7% adverse camber in one direction to a 7%
adverse camber in the other. This does not supply enough energy for a large goods vehicle to roll-over
although it is close to the limit. Camber changes of greater than 10% (e.g -5 to +5%) are not
recommended so as to allow a margin of safety.
These factors would need to be assessed when checking the sufficiency of the design:
a) crossovers from one 7% adverse camber to another would not be within what is acceptable in TSM
Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N];
b) crossovers should cross the central reserve at a shallow angle of no more than 20 degrees, where
possible, to the existing road. This factor is important whatever the width of the central reserve;
c) changes in level or camber should be gradual and preferably on a straight section.
B8
Stopping sight distance
Stopping sight distances (SSD) should be measured to the low object in accordance with CD 109 [Ref
2.N], for each temporary lane. Sighting outside the line of cones is not permitted when measuring SSD.
Table D.1 gives the absolute minimum requirements for SSD through crossovers for the temporary
mandatory speed limit adopted. Cones and barriers should be placed so that Table D.1 values are
achieved. For some roads e.g. smart motorways, the SSD requirements for the permanent design of
the road may be reduced or subject to extra relaxations. These do not apply during road works as the
safety requirements for road users are different and the requirements of Table D.1 apply even if longer
than that provided in the permanent road design.
The specification for the temporary traffic management should include details of the required SSD.
Sometimes visibility greater than the absolute minimum SSD requirement can be partially achieved if
TTM equipment is carefully located to allow some limited enhancement of sightlines across the safety
zone or working space.
Where width is limited and narrow lanes and reduced setbacks to cones or barriers are to be adopted, it
may be necessary to increase horizontal radii purely for the reason of achieving the required SSD.
Where adverse factors exist (Table D.3), the step increases in radii (Table D.4) will also automatically
help to improve SSD. Using small radii may compromise SSD in certain circumstances. In all cases
SSD should be checked locally, including vertical effects, to ensure that Table D.1 values are achieved.
Due to the large number of variables at a crossover, using radii from Table D.4 does not guarantee SSD
compliance in the horizontal plane.

Appendix C. Changeovers
Appendix C. Changeovers
Changeover geometry should follow the same principles as used with crossovers. Changeovers are
more likely to be designed with multiple lanes leading to the need to assess different methods of
delineating the layout to road users. In addition changeovers can be used in 'relaxation' schemes
where the design speed is always the permanent speed limit.
Changeovers on standard schemes may result in lane widths changing along their length, to fit in with
existing lane markings or where all the markings have been removed to enable a narrower lane to be
applied. It is recommended that any lane width reduction is implemented in locations where the
desirable minimum SSD from CD 109 [Ref 2.N] is achieved to both the high and the low point. This
may require lane widths to be maintained where the inner radius of a curve is delineated by cones,
cylinders or barriers. Where lane widths do change through a changeover the delineation on both
edges of any lane needs to be clear; it would be expected that higher performing products identified in
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] are used.
To be within the scope of a relaxation scheme identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] any changeover
will need to provide an adequate level of road user safety without the removal or replacement of road
markings. If more than one lane is included in the changeover then the edge delineation will need to be
enhanced as identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] i.e. Class R2B cones and warning lamps used as a
minimum.
To be within the scope of a relaxation scheme identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] the SSD at
changeovers will need to be at least the desirable minimum for the design speed from CD 109 [Ref
2.N]. Transient reduction in SSD to the low point caused by the TTM may be acceptable but SSD to the
high point will need to be be maintained throughout the changeover.
To be within the scope of a relaxation scheme identified in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 4.N] a single lane
changeover will need to be wider than the desirable minimum for the class(es) of vehicle using the
changeover e.g. non-notifiable abnormal loads. The lane width downstream of the changeover will
need to be at least 3.3m. If a scheme is designed outside this boundaries then it would not meet the
criteria for a relaxation scheme.
