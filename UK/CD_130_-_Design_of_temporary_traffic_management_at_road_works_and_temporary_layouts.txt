Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides the requirements for the design of temporary traffic management for road
works and temporary layouts.
This document is intended for use by specialist temporary traffic management designers. For the
majority of schemes, temporary traffic management is a construction phase design item.
Consistent design of traffic management arrangements at road work sites minimises the risk to road
users, road workers and other parties at these obstructions.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 8.N] apply to this document.

through road works or other temporary road layouts through
the provision of information, instructions and warnings.
Temporary traffic regulation order
(TTRO)

Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 and Safety at Street Works and Road Works: A Code of Practice
2.1
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 27.N] and Streetworks CoP [Ref 18.N]shall be applied to the design of TTM for
road works and temporary layouts as described in the national application annexes of this document.

TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 27.N] sets out a code of practice to enable the Overseeing Organisations to meet
the relevant legal requirements in a wide variety of circumstances at road works and other temporary
situations.
NOTE 2
Streetworks CoP [Ref 18.N] sets out a code of practice for those carrying out signing, lighting and
guarding of street works and road works on all highways and roads, except motorways and any dual
carriageways with a speed limit of 50 mph or more.
NOTE 3
Compliance with Streetworks CoP [Ref 18.N]does not assure compliance with the Applicable Equality
Act.
Applicable Traffic Signs Regulations
2.2
Temporary traffic signs must be of the size, shape, colour and type prescribed for that use in the
Applicable Traffic Signs Regulations.
NOTE
Working drawings are provided for some temporary traffic signs by the Overseeing Organisation.
2.3
Miscellaneous temporary traffic signs must only be used for the situations permitted in the applicable
traffic signs regulations.
2.4
Miscellaneous temporary traffic signs must be the size, shape, colour and type, shape, colour and type
permitted in the applicable traffic signs regulations.
2.5
Authorisation shall be obtained for temporary traffic signs that are not prescribed in the applicable traffic
signs regulations.
NOTE
The authorisation procedure is described in CD 120 [Ref 3.N].
General requirements for TTM
2.6
TTM shall be designed on a site-specific basis.
2.7
TTM shall be designed to minimise traffic delays and disruption to all road users and other parties.
2.8
Safe systems of work, including safety risk assessment, design review and design approval, shall be
developed and followed in the design of TTM.
2.9
Where required by the proposed TTM arrangements, temporary traffic regulation orders (TTROs) shall
be implemented.
NOTE 1
The highway authority is responsible for drafting, promoting and making TTROs although input (e.g.
the location of the TTM signs) is required from the TTM designer.
NOTE 2
TTROs will be needed, as examples, for
1)
a temporary reduction in speed limit;
2)
temporary hard shoulder running;
3)
temporary road closures;
4)
temporary use of the offside lane of a motorway with three or more lanes by prohibited vehicles;
and,
5)
the temporary imposition or suspension of other parking or moving traffic restrictions (e.g.
banned turns).

2.10
The outputs from the design of TTM shall include all details to define the scope of the TTM
arrangements; the TTM phases; and the TTM personnel, plant, equipment and systems of work to be

parties, where required.
2.12
TTM layout drawings or models shall detail all permanent and temporary traffic signs, road markings,
road studs and temporary vehicle restraint systems, which are to form part of the TTM arrangements or
are to be removed, including their:

applicable traffic signs regulations; and,
3)
dimensions.

Temporary traffic signs
Design outputs for temporary traffic signs
3.1
For each temporary traffic sign, the design outputs shall include:
1)
the coefficient of retroreflection class;
2)
the mean luminance or illuminance class;
3)
the mounting arrangements; and,
4)
the ballast weight (where required).
The design of temporary traffic signs
3.2
The design of temporary traffic signs shall be carried out by applying BS 8442 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE
Section 2 of CC 130 [Ref 2.N] contains the applicable visual performance characteristics and classes
for temporary traffic sign faces from BS EN 12899-1 [Ref 6.N].
Coefficient of retroreflection for temporary traffic signs
3.3
For temporary traffic signs that require retroreflection, the minimum coefficient of retroreflection class of
the sign face shall be as stated in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3 Minimum retroreflection class of sign face
Retroreflection class
Scenario
RA1
For lit signs or signs only displayed during daylight hours
RA2
Where the sign is unlit or partially lit during the hours of darkness
R3B-UK or R3C-UK
Where TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 27.N] uses these classes for specific signs or
uses
3.4
Microprismatic retroreflective material shall be mounted vertically unless a sign sheeting supplier
confirms in writing that the microprismatic material performs adequately when erected at an angle off
the vertical not exceeding 22.5 degrees.
NOTE
The retroreflective performance of a sign mounted non-vertically is lower than compared to a sign
installed vertically. Designers are encouraged to mount signs vertically whenever possible.
3.4.1
Microprismatic retroreflective sheeting that meets the initial requirements of Class R2 or R1 in BS EN
12899-1 [Ref 6.N] may be used in place of material to Classes RA2 and RA1 respectively.
Mean luminance or illuminance class for temporary traffic signs
3.5
Where a temporary traffic sign is transilluminated or externally illuminated, the background luminance
of the area in which it is to be placed shall be established so that the mean luminance or illuminance

3. Temporary traffic signs
3.8
Where a temporary traffic sign is to be in place for road works for between 6 to 12 months, an
assessment shall be undertaken to determine whether post-mounting or use of a temporary support is
more appropriate.
3.9
Where a temporary traffic sign is to be in place for temporary layouts for longer than 6 months then it
shall be post-mounted.
3.10
Any system used to mount temporary traffic signs shall be capable of resisting a specified wind load
according to BS 8442 [Ref 9.N].
3.11
The lower edge of a temporary traffic sign face shall be a minimum of 300 mm from the surface of the
carriageway.
3.11.1
Temporary traffic signs which are self-supported should be positioned in verges or central reservations,
where present.
Ballasting of temporary traffic signs
3.12
The type and amount of ballast to be added to self-supported temporary traffic signs shall be
determined in accordance with BS 8442 [Ref 9.N]so that they remain stable.
Covering traffic sign faces
3.13
Where permanent traffic sign faces are to be temporarily covered so that they are not visible to road
users, a product which is capable of being removed without damage to the sign face shall be selected.
3.13.1
Where a permanent traffic sign is to be temporarily covered, guidance should be sought from the sign's
manufacturer about the most suitable temporary covering method.
NOTE
Methods of temporarily covering a permanent traffic sign can include masking, bagging and
obscuration.
