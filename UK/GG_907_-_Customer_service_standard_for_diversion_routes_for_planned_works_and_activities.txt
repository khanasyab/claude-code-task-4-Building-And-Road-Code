Introduction
Introduction
Background
By virtue of the Infrastructure Act 2015 c.7 [Ref 5.N], the Traffic Management Act 2004 c.18 [Ref 12.N]
was revised to include Highways England as a network management authority. As such, Highways
England is legally obligated to facilitate the expeditious movement of traffic both on our own network
and on the network of other traffic authorities. Consequently, this changes our legal position in terms of
diversion routes; with fit for purpose diversion routes being central, not only to meeting this obligation,
but to providing our customers with a continuous journey during closures of the network, which
ultimately supports our Highways England Licence [Ref 3.N] requirement to proactively minimise
disruption.
Section 5.1 of Highways England's licence stipulates that Highways England should:
1) seek to minimise disruption to road users that might reasonably be expected to occur as a result of:
a) planned disruption to the network (including from road works); and,
b) unplanned disruption to the network (including from incidents on the network and the short-term
effects of extreme weather conditions); and,
2) proactively and reactively provide relevant, accurate and timely information about traffic and
conditions on the network to road users, including when there is disruption.
Highways England has therefore developed requirements for diversion routes for planned works and
activities in order to build customer trust in diversion routes and show our customers that we care.
The objective of this document is to ensure the safe and suitable transportation of motorway and all
purpose trunk road network traffic around a planned closure and to proactively seek to minimise the
disruption to our customers and communities.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] apply to this document.
