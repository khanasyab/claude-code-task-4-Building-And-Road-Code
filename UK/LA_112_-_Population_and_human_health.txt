Introduction
Introduction
Background
The motorway and all-purpose trunk road(s) connect people and places, supporting businesses and
enabling access to employment, healthcare, education and other community assets.
Conversely, impacts associated with construction and improvement projects, (such as direct land take
and severance) may affect private property, community and businesses/development land as well as
agricultural land holdings.
The motorway and all-purpose trunk road network network can also affect the health of individuals and
communities.
This document provides a framework for assessing, mitigating and reporting the effects of motorway
and all-purpose trunk road projects on population and health. It introduces significance criteria that aid
consistent and proportionate assessment to support the reporting of significant effects of population
and human health.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Land-use and accessibility
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall report on the likely effects of projects on land-use and accessibility
covering the following elements:
1) private property and housing;
2) community land and assets;
3) development land and businesses;
4) agricultural land holdings; and
5) WCH.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall report on the nature and scale of effects on the land use and
accessibility elements as either:
1) beneficial;
2) neutral; or
3) adverse.
3.3
The scoping assessment shall report on the likely changes to accessibility and severance for private
property and housing, community land and assets, development land and businesses and agricultural
land holdings.
3.4
The scoping assessment shall report on the likely changes to WCH provision as a result of the project.
3.5
Where the requirement to acquire land and assets is likely to result in significant effects, either through
direct land take or the restriction of accessibility/introduction of severance, further assessment shall be
undertaken.
Study area
3.6
The study area shall be based on the construction footprint/project boundary (including compounds and
temporary land take) plus a 500m area surrounding the project boundary.
3.6.1
Where likely effects are identified outside the 500m area surrounding the project boundary, the study
area should be extended accordingly.
3.6.2
Where effects are unlikely to occur within the 500m area surrounding the project boundary, the study
area should be reduced accordingly.
Baseline scenario
3.7
The process for developing the land use and accessibility baseline shall comprise the following phases:
1) data collection (commencing at the screening/scoping stage and developed with greater detail if
further assessment is required);
2) spatial data mapping; and
3) consultation (where required to inform assessment conclusions).
3.8
The indicative types of data to be collected to form the baseline for land use and accessibility shall
comprise:
1) private property and housing:
a) the location and number of properties at risk of demolition, or from which land will be
required/access affected by a project; and
b) the location of residential development land and number of units that will be affected by a project.

3. Assessment methodology
Design and mitigation
3.15
The following mitigation hierarchy shall be implemented during design and assessment:
1) avoidance and prevention:
a) identify alternative design/route options that avoid the requirement to compulsory purchase
property, land and assets; and
b) identify alternative design/route options that avoid introducing or worsening severance and avoid
reducing WCH provision/increasing journey times.
2) reduction:
a) minimise impacts on property, land and assets by selecting route alignments that avoid land take
from the most sensitive receptors/aspects of receptors thereby maintaining viability; and
b) by altering alignment to minimise severance to communities and disruption to WCH provision.
3) remediation: where it is not possible to avoid or reduce a significant adverse affect, e.g. community
sports pitches have to be acquired to facilitate construction, provide equivalent facilities as close to
the original location as possible.
NOTE
Engagement with designers and stakeholders early in the assessment and design process increases
the effectiveness of design and mitigation measures.
3.16
WCH design, assessment and provision shall be in accordance with GG 142 [Ref 8.N] Walking, cycling
and horse-riding assessment and review.
Environmental enhancement
3.17
Enhancement opportunities shall be identified and reported during all stages in a project's life cycle.
NOTE
Example enhancement opportunities for land use and accessibility include;
1) returning non-operational highway estate to community use/ownership (in agreement with relevant
land owners) following completion of construction.
Reporting
3.18
Land use effects shall be assessed during construction and for the first year of operation (future year
scenario).
NOTE
After year the first year of operation, effects on land use associated with routine maintenance
operations are unlikely to be significant.
3.19
The design and assessment shall follow the process illustrated in Figure 3.19.

3. Assessment methodology
2) severance/accessibility and the ability of communities to access community land, assets and
employment.
NOTE
Changes in accessibility/severance for communities that can influence health outcomes include (but
are not limited to):
1) reduced or increased access to open green space/recreational facilities;
2) reduced or increased opportunities for WCH; and
3) reduced or increased opportunities for accessing healthcare facilities.
3.22
Where a project has the potential to result in adverse health outcomes, further assessment shall be
undertaken.
Study area
3.23
The study area shall be defined based on the following:
1) the extent and characteristics of a project, and
2) the communities/wards directly and indirectly affected by the project.
NOTE
The study area is unique to each project and is based on the sensitivity of affected communities and
the nature/extent of the project resulting in changes to health determinants.
Baseline scenario
3.24
The process for developing the health baseline shall comprise the following phases:
1) data collection (commencing at the screening/scoping stage and developed if further assessment is
required);
2) spatial data mapping; and
3) consultation.
3.25
The baseline health profiles of the communities within the study area shall be established, including the
following data;
1) percentage of community with increased susceptibility to health issues (vulnerable members, e.g.
<16 & >65);
2) percentage of community with pre-existing health issues (e.g respiratory disease/chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD));
3) deaths from respiratory diseases;
4) percentage of community with long term illness or disability;
5) general health;
6) life expectancy; and
7) income deprivation.
3.26
The following indicative types of health determinants shall be identified to inform the baseline scenario:
1) the location and type of community, recreational and education facilities and severance/separation
of communities from such facilities;
2) the location of green/open space and severance/separation of communities from such facilities;
3) the location of healthcare facilities and severance/separation of communities from such facilities;
4) outline spatial characteristics of the transport network and usage in the area, including the
surrounding road network, Public Rights of Way (including bridleways), cycle ways, non-designated
public routes and public transport routes;
5) air quality management areas and ambient air quality;

6) areas recognised as being sensitive to noise (e.g. noise important areas, noise management areas)
and the ambient noise environment;
7) sources and pathways of potential pollution (e.g. land/water contamination);
8) landscape amenity;
9) safety information associated with the existing affected road network (e.g. numbers of killed and
seriously injured); and
10) where available, information collated from stakeholder consultation.
NOTE
Information collated to inform the land use and accessibility assessment can be used to inform the
changes in accessibility/severance to communities in the context of human health.
3.27
Data collected shall be in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's asset data requirements.
Assessment criteria - human health
3.28
A qualitative assessment of human health shall be undertaken, with evidence provided to support
conclusions.
3.28.1
The geographical extent of the impacts considered within the qualitative assessment should be
dependent upon the nature and characteristics of a project and sensitivity of receptors.
NOTE 1
Although the assessment of human health effects describes the likely qualitative health outcomes, it is
not possible to quantify the severity or extent of the effects which give rise to these outcomes. The
potential health outcomes during construction and operation are based on broad categories for the
qualitative impacts identified.
NOTE 2
The plausibility of a project generating an impact on the health of individuals and communities can be
evidenced using a source-pathway-receptor model IEMA health in EIA [Ref 1.I].
3.29
Changes to health determinants as a result of a project shall be identified.
3.29.1
Information gathered for other environmental factors, such as air quality, should be used to help identify
changes to health determinants.
NOTE
A change to a single health determinant can affect the health status of different individuals or
communities depending on their characteristics and sensitivity to change, thereby generating multiple
health outcomes.
3.30
Once the health profile of communities has been established, the sensitivity of a community/population
to change shall be identified (supported with evidence).
3.31
The sensitivity of a community/population shall be reported as:
1) low;
2) medium; or
3) high
3.32
Once community/population sensitivity and changes to health determinants likely to occur as a result of
a project have been established, the likely health outcome(s) shall be identified in line with the
categories in Table 3.32, with evidence provided to support conclusions.

3. Assessment methodology
Design and mitigation
3.33
The following mitigation hierarchy shall be implemented during the design and assessment process:
1) avoidance and prevention: identify alternative design/route options that avoid severing highly
sensitive communities and avoid compounding existing health issues in sensitive communities, e.g.
avoid worsening air quality in sensitive communities where EU limit values are currently being
exceeded;
2) reduction: minimise severance/isolating communities from facilities/services by providing
connectivity over/under the route option, and provide mitigation to minimise health effects e.g. install
noise fencing where appropriate; and
3) remediation: where there is likely to be a significant change to a health determinant, e.g. loss of
recreation space, provide replacement equivalent facilities as close as possible to the original
facility.
NOTE
Engagement with designers and stakeholders early in the assessment and design process increases
the effectiveness of design and mitigation measures.
Environmental enhancement
3.34
Enhancement opportunities shall be identified and reported during all stages in a project's life cycle.
NOTE
Example enhancement opportunities for population and health include:
1) increasing WCH provision from baseline levels to encourage WCH journeys and reduce journey
times; and
2) investment in community initiatives such as tree planting on community land/open space as a
means of enhancing the local landscape amenity.
Reporting
3.35
Health effects shall be assessed during construction and up to year 15 of operation (future year
scenario).
NOTE
After year 15 of operation, population and health effects associated with routine maintenance
operations are unlikely to be significant.
3.36
The design and assessment shall follow the process illustrated in Figure 3.36.
