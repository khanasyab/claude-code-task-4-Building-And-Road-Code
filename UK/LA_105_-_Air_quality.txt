Introduction
Introduction
Background
Projects can have significant air quality effects on human health and designated habitats and / or affect
the UK's reported ability to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible.
Effects can result from the project itself (alone) or in combination with other plans or projects.
This document provides a framework for assessing, mitigating and reporting the effects of motorway
and all-purpose trunk road projects on air quality by:
1)
determining whether the impacts of a project on human health or designated habitats can trigger
a significant air quality effect;
2)
determining whether the impacts of a project affects the UK's reported ability to comply with the
2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible;
3)
determining whether construction activities associated with the delivery of the project triggers a
significant air quality effect on nearby sensitive receptors;
4)
assessing and applying the appropriate mitigation measures and air quality monitoring where a
project:
a)
triggers a significant air quality effect;
b)
affects the UK's reported ability to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest
timescales possible; or,
c)
results in adverse dust impacts.
This document aligns with Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU (hereafter referred to as
the EIA Directive).
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] apply to this document.

Assessment methodology
Scoping
2.1
The following traffic scoping criteria shall be used to determine whether the air quality impacts of a
project can be scoped out or require an assessment based on the changes between the do something
traffic (with the project) compared to the do minimum traffic (without the project) in the opening year:
1)
annual average daily traffic (AADT) ≥1,000; or
2)
heavy duty vehicle (HDV) AADT ≥200; or
3)
a change in speed band; or
4)
a change in carriageway alignment by ≥5 m.
NOTE 1
The AADT and HDV criteria are applied to the sum of carriageways and not individual carriageways.
NOTE 2
The 1,000 vehicles and 200 HDVs represent the lowest threshold above which the traffic model can
represent change in traffic conditions to a reasonable level of confidence.
2.2
The air quality assessment shall be based on the most likely forecast of traffic flows.
NOTE
There is no requirement to model other traffic growth sensitivity scenarios; for example high and low
growth traffic scenarios.
2.3
The traffic scoping criteria shall only be applied to the area covered by the traffic model that the
competent expert for traffic has identified as reliable for inclusion in an environmental assessment, and
is referred to as the traffic reliability area (TRA).
2.3.1
The competent expert for traffic should work with the competent expert for air quality to ensure that the
TRA covers those areas that are likely to be sensitive to changes in air quality, e.g. where there are:
1)
monitored exceedances of air quality thresholds;
2)
air quality management areas (AQMAs);
3)
areas identified by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as exceeding
EU limit values; and/or
4)
designated habitats.
NOTE
Where applicable, Overseeing Organisation-specific requirements for air quality are provided in the
National Application Annexes.
2.4
The traffic and air quality competent experts shall agree the study area to be included in the air quality
assessment.
2.5
A statement shall be included in the assessment detailing how the study area was defined and that the
TRA is appropriate for the air quality assessment.
2.6
Where the project does not lead to a change in any of the traffic scoping criteria then an air quality
assessment shall not be required and can be scoped out.
2.7
Where the air quality assessment is scoped out, a statement shall be provided stating that the traffic
scoping criteria have not been triggered and consequently there was no requirement for an air quality
assessment.
2.8
Where a project triggers the traffic scoping criteria, a figure shall be prepared depicting all the roads
that meet these criteria, and all roads with modelled traffic data within 200 m of these roads.
NOTE
All roads that trigger the traffic screening criteria, and adjoining roads within 200 m, is defined as the
affected road network (ARN).
2.9
Once the need for an assessment has been concluded, the type of assessment, either a simple or
detailed assessment, shall be determined.
2.10
The flow chart in Figure 2.10 shall be used to determine whether a simple or detailed air quality
assessment is required and the level of assessment is determined by the level of risk and the stage of
assessment for a project.

2. Assessment methodology
2.10.1
The level of assessment is determined by the level of risk and the assessment stage for the project,
and at the options selection and preliminary design stages a simple assessment should be sufficient.
NOTE 1
A simple assessment provides sufficient information to confirm that the project does not result in any
exceedances of the air quality thresholds.
NOTE 2
A detailed level of assessment is more likely where there is a risk of exceeding air quality thresholds
and for the detailed design stage of the project lifecycle.
2.11
Tables 2.11a and 2.11b shall be used in conjunction with the flowchart in Figure 2.10 to determine a
project's risk potential, and whether a simple or detailed air quality assessment is undertaken.

NOTE
Low risk projects are likely to result in traffic changes that are localised to the project and high risk
projects are likely to impact traffic flows over a much wider area.
2.12
Where monitoring data evidence is used to inform the risk to the receiving environment, a competent
expert for air quality shall determine whether there is a sufficient coverage of monitoring sites or if
additional monitoring sites are required.

2. Assessment methodology
2.14
The competent expert for air quality shall consult the Overseeing Organisation if a detailed assessment
is being proposed at options selection and preliminary design stage, with a justification for this
approach.
Baseline
Air quality data
2.15
The following baseline information shall be gathered to inform the air quality assessment:
1)
air quality monitoring data such as obtained from local authority, Defra, and the Overseeing
Organisation;
2)
local authority air quality reports including the locations of any AQMAs within, or close to, the
border of the ARN;
3)
local authority air quality action plans (AQAPs);
4)
information regarding compliance with the EU Directive, zonal / agglomeration exceedance status
including local air quality plans prepared to support the Government's National Air Quality Plan
for achieving compliance with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N];
5)
pollution climatic mapping (PCM) modelled concentrations that coincide with roads included in
the ARN;
6)
background maps for NOx concentrations and nitrogen deposition, where designated habitats are
included in the assessment; and,
7)
planning applications for any future developments that could introduce new receptors that could
be affected by the project in the opening year.
2.16
Where it is identified that additional project-specific baseline air quality monitoring is required following
the review of the baseline information, this shall be justified to and agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation prior to any monitoring being deployed.
2.17
Monitoring data shall be provided to the Overseeing Organisation on a quarterly basis throughout the
monitoring period.
Air quality modelling
Selecting sensitive receptors - human health
2.18
Sensitive receptors shall be chosen within 200 m of the ARN and include residential properties, schools
and hospitals for the assessment of annual mean air quality thresholds.
2.19
Where there is a risk of the short term air quality thresholds being exceeded then sensitive receptors
locations including gardens and playing fields shall be assessed.
NOTE
Sensitive receptors are defined in Defra's local air quality management technical guidance (LAQM) TG
16 [Ref 8.N].
2.20
Representative sensitive receptors shall be chosen to ensure that those receptors with the highest
pollutant concentrations (closest to the road, junctions, etc.) or anticipated to experience highest level
of change (next to roads within the ARN with the largest change in the traffic screening criteria) are
included in the air quality assessment.
2.21
Where exceedances of the air quality thresholds are predicted at the representative sensitive receptors
in the air quality modelling, additional sensitive receptors shall be included in the air quality modelling to
capture all sensitive receptors with exceedances in either the do minimum or do something scenarios.
2.21.1
There should be no need to model all receptors within 200 m, or an excessive number of receptors in
the same area, to determine whether there is likely to be any exceedances in the do minimum or do
something scenarios.
2.21.2
It should only be necessary to model PM10 for the base year to demonstrate that there is no impact on
achievement of the PM10 air quality thresholds as a result of the project.

2. Assessment methodology
2.21.3
Where the air quality modelling indicates exceedances of the PM10 air quality thresholds in the base
year then PM10 should be included in the air quality model in the do minimum and do something
scenarios.
2.21.4
There should be no need to model PM2.5 as the UK currently meets its legal requirements for the
achievement of the PM2.5 air quality thresholds, and the modelling of PM10 can be used to demonstrate
that the project does not impact on the PM2.5 air quality threshold.
NOTE
There are very few areas in the UK outside of London that exceed the air quality thresholds for
particulate matter (PM10 or PM2.5).
Selecting qualifying features - compliance risk assessment
2.22
The compliance risk assessment shall only be undertaken on the roads identified in the PCM model
which are within the ARN.
2.23
The assessment shall identify areas with qualifying features on the PCM road network that meet
Defra's interpretation of the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 1
Qualifying features include public access (footpath for example) and sensitive receptors (such as
residential properties, schools) within 15 m of the running lane/kerbside, but are not within 25 m of a
junction.
NOTE 2
Where applicable, Overseeing Organisation-specific requirements for air quality are provided in the
national application annexes to this document.
2.24
Sensitive receptors shall be chosen within 15 m of the ARN and include residential properties, schools,
hospitals, and public access for inclusion in the compliance risk assessment for the assessment of
annual mean EU limit values.
Selecting sensitive receptors - designated habitats
2.25
Internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological conservation importance on
protected species and on habitats and other species identified as being of principal importance for the
conservation of biodiversity (known as designated habitats), within 200 m of the ARN, shall be included
in the air quality assessment.
NOTE
Designated habitats include 'Ramsar' sites, special protection areas, special areas of conservation,
sites of special scientific interest, local nature reserves, local wildlife sites, nature improvement areas,
ancient woodland and veteran trees.
2.26
For each designated habitat, transect receptor points at 10-m intervals shall be modelled, starting from
the nearest point of the designated habitat to the road, up to a maximum distance of 200 m regardless
of whether the habitat extends beyond 200 m.
2.26.1
Only sites that are sensitive to nitrogen deposition should be included in the assessment. (It is not
necessary to include sites, for example, that have been designated as a geological feature or water
course.)
Traffic data requirements
2.27
The traffic data used shall be proportionate to the level of the air quality assessment.
2.27.1
For options selection and preliminary design stage or simple air quality assessment, AADT/AAWT
traffic data should suffice.
2.27.2
For a detailed air quality assessment, traffic split by the four periods, morning (AM), inter peak (IP),
evening peak (PM) and overnight period (OP) should suffice.
2.27.3
It should not be necessary to model weekend traffic conditions unless there is a specific requirement
for the project and a weekend traffic model has been produced.
2.27.4
The Overseeing Organisation should be contacted for a copy of the traffic data template, which sets out
the required traffic data format to undertake the air quality assessment.

2. Assessment methodology
NOTE 1
It is not necessary to incorporate diurnal profiles into the AADT traffic flows, period flows can be used in
preference as they include different flow profiles (total and percentage heavy duty vehicles) and speeds.
NOTE 2
The competent expert for traffic can advise on the hours that are most representative of the various
periods used in the air quality assessment.
Choice of air quality model
2.28
The most appropriate air quality model shall be used to complete the air quality assessment.
2.28.1
The DMRB air quality spreadsheet, which is available from the Overseeing Organisation, may be used
for early option appraisal and simple air quality assessments.
2.28.2
A detailed dispersion air quality model may be used in instances that require the modelling of complex
motorway junctions or for detailed air quality assessments.
Speed band emission factors
2.29
The pivoted speeds shall be allocated a speed band. There are four speed bands for urban roads and
four speed bands for motorways.
2.30
The method specified in Appendix A shall be used to to generate the speed bands from the traffic
model.
2.31
The air quality model shall use the latest speed banded emission factors which are available from the
Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
The speed band emissions tool is to be updated when a new version of the emission factor toolkit is
released.
2.32
The emission factors corresponding to each speed band provided from the traffic data shall be used in
the air quality model.
NOTE
In addition to speed bands for normal driving conditions, speed bands have also been generated for
speed management interventions, including 70 mph and 60 mph speed management options.
2.33
Where speed management mitigation measures are included in the project air quality action plan
(PAQAP), they shall only be applied to motorways and dual carriageways where they operate at high
speed driving conditions.
2.34
Where AADT or AAWT traffic information is used to undertake the assessment, the AADT or AAWT
speed shall be used to identify the relevant speed band.
2.35
Where mainline motorway links are identified as being in the heavy congestion speed band category,
then a check shall be undertaken by a competent expert for traffic of the observed speeds to ensure
that the evidence supports the selection of this speed band.
2.35.1
Within a 100-m radius of the centre of the junction on an urban/rural road in all directions should be
assigned the light congestion speed band, but there can be instances when the heavy congestion
speed band is a better representation of the traffic conditions.
2.36
Only areas around junctions identified as sensitive to changes in air quality that can result in
exceedances of air quality thresholds shall be assessed in greater detail.
NOTE
It is recommended that a proportionate approach is adopted when splitting the traffic model links into
more detail around junctions.
2.37
Emissions on motorway entry slip roads shall be set to heavy congestion.
2.38
Emissions on motorway exit slip roads shall be set to free flow.
NOTE
Emissions on motorway entry and exit slip roads can be significantly different due to vehicle dynamics
and emissions can be much higher for vehicles using entry slip roads as they accelerate to join the
mainline, where as engine load is much lower on exit slip roads as vehicles slow for the junction.

2. Assessment methodology
Calculation of road NOx
2.39
The air quality assessment shall include predictions for the base year, do minimum and do something
scenarios, in the opening year.
2.39.1
The modelling should take account of the latest version of Defra's Local Air Quality Management
Technical Guidance TG 16 [Ref 8.N].
2.40
Road NOx concentrations shall be calculated for each of the identified sensitive receptors for the base
year, and do minimum and do something in the opening year.
2.41
For each designated habitat, modelled road nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations shall be calculated at
the identified transect receptor points, for the base year, and do minimum and do something in the
opening year.
2.42
The road NOx concentration shall be converted to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using the latest published
version of Defra's air quality tools LAQM [Ref 9.N] including the background pollutant maps and NOx to
NO2 conversion spreadsheet.
Calculation of nitrogen deposition
2.43
For each point along a transect, the road NOx concentration shall be converted to road NO2, for the
base year, and do minimum and do something in the opening year.
2.44
The road NO2 shall be converted to dry nutrient nitrogen (N) deposition rate (kg N/ha/yr).
2.44.1
The following conversion rates of NO2 concentrations (1 µg/m3 ) to N deposition kg N/ha/yr taken from
the air quality advisory group guidance document AQTAG06 [Ref 2.I] should be used for:
1)
grassland and similar habitats: 1 µg/m3 of NO2 = 0.14 kg N/ha/yr;
2)
forests and similar habitats: 1 µg/m3 of NO2 = 0.29 kg N/ha/yr.
2.44.2
The following conversion rates of NO2 concentrations (1) to N deposition kg N/ha/yr taken from the air
quality advisory group guidance document should be used for:* grassland and similar habitats: 1 of
NO2 = 0.14 kg N/ha/Yr;* forests and similar habitats: 1g/m3 of NO2 = 0.29 kg N/ha/yr.
NOTE
Wet deposition does not need to be considered for the assessment of road projects as this is not
significant for short range emissions such as those emitted from vehicles.
2.45
The road N deposition rate for the base year, do minimum and do something in the opening year shall
be added to the background N deposition for each point along the transect.
2.46
The source for the background nitrogen deposition rate shall be recorded in the air quality assessment.
2.46.1
The background nitrogen deposition rate may be obtained from the air pollution information system
(APIS) (see APIS (website) [Ref 1.I]) for the relevant designated habitat.
NOTE
The N deposition rates from the APIS background maps can be used as published, and there is no
requirement to remove road components from the background maps.
Addressing uncertainty in predicted future roadside nitrogen dioxide
concentrations
2.47
Once the air quality modelling has been completed for the project, adjustments to the verified modelled
nitrogen dioxide concentration shall be made to account for future roadside NO2 concentrations.
2.48
To ensure that the modelled roadside NO2 concentrations are not too optimistic, an additional scenario
(hereafter referred to as the projected base year) shall be included in the air quality modelling to enable
a gap analysis to be completed.
NOTE
The gap analysis is the application of adjustment factors which take into consideration the assumed
roadside rates of reduction in NOx and NO2 by Defra's modelling tools compared to observed roadside
monitoring trend; that is the gap between the predicted reductions and those observed.

2.50
Total NO2 concentrations for the projected base year scenario shall be calculated and verified using the

2.51
Individual gap factors shall be calculated for each modelled receptor using the following approach:
1)
collate the modelled total NO2 concentrations for the base year, projected base year, do-minimum
and do-something in the opening year;
2)
divide the modelled projected base year NO2 concentration by the modelled base year NO2
concentration (ratio A);
3)

base year and opening year, i.e. opening year projection factor divided by the base year
projection factor (ratio B); and,
4)
calculate the gap factor by dividing ratio B by ratio A.
2.52

is consistent with Defra's reporting on compliance with the EU limit values.
2.55
Where the gap factor is either too conservative or too optimistic when compared to local monitoring
trends, justification for the deviation from the published gap factor shall be clearly laid out and

NOTE
Evidence supporting such a decision would be primarily based on the trend in air quality monitoring
data from monitoring sites local to the project.

Dust
2.56
The construction dust assessment shall determine the construction dust risk potential of the project to

2.57
All sensitive receptors (human and designated habitats) within 0-50 m, 50-100 m and 100-200 m of all
construction activity shall be identified on a constraints plan.

LA 105 Version 0.1.0
2. Assessment methodology
2.62
The assessment of construction traffic impacts on sensitive receptors shall be proportionate and limited
to the areas of key risk of exceeding air quality thresholds.
Operational assessment
2.63
The outputs of the air quality modelling shall inform the compliance risk assessment and the local air
quality assessment (impact of the project on human and designated sites) to determine whether the
project leads to a significant air quality effect.
Compliance risk assessment
2.64
The competent expert for air quality shall determine whether a project affects UK's reported ability to
comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible and inform whether the
project triggers a significant air quality effect.
2.65
The assessment shall use the latest reported information from Defra's Pollution Climate Mapping
(PCM) model Modelled air quality data [Ref 10.N] , local authority's air quality plans and the modelled
NO2 concentrations from the project's air quality assessment.
NOTE 1
The PCM network includes the roads that Defra model for reporting whether a zone/agglomeration they
reside within complies with the EU limit values.
NOTE 2
For the purposes of assessment and reporting, the UK is divided into 43 zones and agglomerations
(hereafter referred to as zones) and a zone becomes compliant when everywhere in the zone is below
the EU limit values.
2.66
The compliance risk assessment shall be based on identifying areas that have qualifying features that
meet Defra's interpretation of the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N], which include public access (such as a
footpath) and sensitive receptors (residential properties, schools, as examples) that are within 15 m of
the running lane/kerbside, but are not within 25 m of a junction.
NOTE
The annual mean EU limit value applies at the qualifying feature as set out in Defra's technical guidance
on producing local plans for the purposes of assessing compliance with the Air Quality Directive.
2.67
The road links in the PCM model that reside within the extents of the ARN for the project shall be
identified.
2.67.1
The PCM model is not always a perfect match and the professional judgement of a competent expert
for air quality should be applied to align the PCM model road network to the roads included in the ARN.
2.68
Where none of the road links from the PCM model coincide with the ARN a compliance risk assessment
is not required and shall be scoped out and a statement provided stating that, "There are no road links
from the PCM model in the study area for the project and therefore the project does not affect the UK's
reported ability to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible."
Assessment
2.69
For each PCM link within the ARN a review shall be undertaken to determine the location of qualifying
features i.e. a sensitive receptor or public access within 15m of the edge of the running lane (excludes
the hard shoulder) / kerbside, and outside of 25m of a junction.
2.69.1
In relation to public access, footpaths that are perpendicular to the road (pedestrian crossings,
footbridges or pedestrian tunnels across, under or over the road) these should not be considered, as
public exposure would be minimal in these locations, and Defra has advised that they are not to be
included in the compliance assessment.
2.70
The area 25 m around junctions shall be excluded from the compliance risk assessment, irrespective of
whether there are any sensitive receptors or public access within 15 m of the edge of the roads within
the junction.
NOTE 1
For major motorway junctions the area is defined as 25 m from the end of the slip road.

2. Assessment methodology
NOTE 2
For non-motorway junctions a "major junction" is defined as a junction which interrupts the traffic flow
on the road and includes, for example, traffic-light-controlled junctions.
2.71
A figure showing the PCM road network and the qualifying features modelled for the compliance risk
assessment shall be reported in the environmental assessment.
2.72
If there are no qualifying features within 15 m of the running lane and not within 25 m of a junction,
along the length of the PCM link, then no further assessment for the PCM link shall be undertaken; this
conclusion is to be recorded in the environmental assessment.
2.73
Where there are qualifying features along the PCM link the air quality model used for the project shall
be used to model NO2 concentrations for:
1)
the nearest qualifying feature along each PCM link where concentrations are highest; and,
2)
a 4-m point from the running lane in the same location as the qualifying feature for comparison
against the national PCM modelled point.
Local model 4-m point validation
2.74
The 4-m model results from the project modelling shall be tabulated to include the PCM road census
ID, and the modelled NO2 concentration from either the PCM model or local authority local air quality
plan for the base year for comparison against the PCM model.
2.75
The 4-m point shall be used to determine whether the air quality for the project aligns with the PCM
outputs from the national model corresponding to the opening year of the project.
2.75.1
If there are significant differences between the two modelled values at the 4-m point (i.e. greater than
10%), where there are modelled exceedances in either data set, the inputs into the local model used for
the project should be investigated to ensure that the outputs of the project's traffic and air quality
modelling are robust.
2.76
The output from this review of the 4-m modelling shall confirm that the traffic and the local air quality
modelling for the project are robust, i.e. confirmation that the model verification is the most appropriate
and the traffic data in that area has been appropriately validated.
2.77
The local air quality model predictions shall be used instead of the reported NO2 concentrations from
the PCM model to inform the compliance risk assessment.
Assessment of compliance risk
2.78
The modelled concentrations in do minimum and do something for the project and the change in
concentration in the opening year, the corresponding PCM road census ID, the modelled NO2
concentration from either the PCM model or local authority local air quality plan for the opening year
shall be tabulated.
2.79
The flow chart in Figure 2.79 shall be followed to complete the compliance risk assessment.

2. Assessment methodology
1)
there is no modelled exceedances of the air quality thresholds for any PCM link; or
2)
there are modelled exceedances of the air quality thresholds for any PCM link, but the change in
annual mean NO2 concentrations between the do minimum and do something is less than or
equal to +/-0.4 µg/m3 ; or,
3)
the project does not materially impact on measures within local air quality or national plans for the
achievement of compliance.
NOTE 1
Local air quality plans developed for the purposes of achieving compliance in the shortest timescales
possible are not the same as local air quality actions plans developed following the declaration of an air
quality management area.
NOTE 2
A material impact on the plan is where the project causes a measure within the national or local plan to
become non-deliverable and thereby having the potential to impact on the achievement of compliance
in the shortest timescale possible.
2.81
A PAQAP shall be prepared describing the proposed mitigation measures as there is a risk to the UK's
reported ability to comply with the Air Quality Directive in the shortest timescale possible where:
1)
the project causes a compliant zone to become non-compliant or delays compliance i.e. it
creates a new maximum in any zone; or,
2)
the project materially impacts the delivery of measures set out in local authority local air quality
plans.
2.82
Proposed viable mitigation measures shall be set out in the PAQAP to ensure the project:
1)
does not cause a compliant zone to become non-compliant, or delays compliance, otherwise the
project cannot be progressed; and,
2)
does not materially impact the delivery of measures set out in local authority local air quality plans.
2.83
Additionally a PAQAP shall be produced where a project leads to a higher concentration at qualifying
features with a change >0.4 µg/m3 in the do something compared to the do minimum.
NOTE
If the maximum do something predicted modelled concentration is lower than in the maximum predicted
do minimum concentration, overall the project is unlikely to delay compliance within the study area for
the project.
2.84
If the proposed measures set out in the PAQAP do not reduce the impact to within 0.4 µg/m3 of the do
minimum and/or there is worsening in air quality of >0.4 µg/m3 on any of the PCM links that exceed the
EU limit value, the competent expert for air quality shall conclude whether this would trigger a
significant air quality effect.
2.84.1
The competent expert for air quality should use the following criteria to establish whether a project
triggers a significant air quality effect;
1)
the qualifying feature being affected e.g. little used/small section of footpath, heavily used
footpaths (such as high streets with cafes etc), residential properties, school etc;
2)
the level of change in concentration as a result of the project and whether it is an overall
worsening or improvement; and,
3)
the number of features being affected e.g. number of PCM links resulting in a deterioration in air
quality as a result of the project.
2.84.2
The use of existing information and mapping collected for the project should provide information on
likely use of public access and it is not envisaged that additional surveys are required.
Evaluating the outcomes of the compliance risk assessment
2.85
The concluding view of the risk to compliance with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales
possible shall be reported in the environmental assessment.
2.86
The assessment shall summarise the evidence behind the conclusion as to whether the project has:

affected the reported ability of the zone to comply with the latest reported timescales;
2)
caused a zone to be non compliant; and/or
3)
materially affected the national or local air quality plan in relation to achievement of compliance in
the quickest time possible.
2.87
The outcomes of the compliance risk assessment shall inform the judgement of significant air quality
effects.
Modelled / monitored exceedances not included in the PCM road network
2.88
Where the local air quality assessment for human health predicts air quality concentrations above the
air quality thresholds, but do not coincide with the PCM road network or are more than 15 m away from
a PCM link, the competent expert for air quality shall contact the Overseeing Organisation.
Human health
2.89
Table 2.91 shall be completed using the outputs from the air quality modelling for only those sensitive
receptors where there are exceedances of the air quality threshold in either the do minimum and/or do
something scenarios.
NOTE
The difference in concentrations is the difference between the do something minus the do minimum
modelled concentrations for each relevant receptor in the model year of the project, that is the worse
case for air quality, which is normally the opening year.
2.90
A conclusion of no likely significant air quality effect for human health shall be recorded where the:
1)
outcomes of the air quality modelling for human health indicate that all concentrations are less
than the air quality thresholds; and/or,
2)
difference in concentrations is imperceptible, that is less than 1% of the air quality threshold (e.g.
0.4 µg/m3 or less for annual mean NO2).
2.91
Where changes in concentrations are greater than 1% of the air quality threshold at qualifying
receptors, then each receptor shall be assigned to one of the six boxes in Table 2.91.

2. Assessment methodology
2.93
The guideline bands shall be used to inform whether the project triggers a significant air quality effect.
2.93.1
Whilst the guideline bands have been provided, they should be a guide as to whether the project is
significant e.g. 29 small worsenings is not significant or 31 small worsenings are significant to
determine whether a project triggers a significant air quality effect.
2.94
The change in concentration at receptors and the total number of receptors shall be used to inform
whether a project has a significant air quality effect.
NOTE 1
Where the total number of receptors compiled in Table 2.92N is less than the lower guideline band for
all the six magnitude of change categories, the project is unlikely to trigger a significant air quality effect
for human health.
NOTE 2
A project can still be deemed significant if the number of receptors affected are below the lower
guideline band, for example where there are changes in concentrations in the small magnitude of
change category, but the changes are approaching the medium magnitude of change criteria (e.g. 1.8 /
1.9 µg/m3 ) then it can still be concluded that the project triggers a significant air quality effect.
2.95
Where the total number of receptors are greater than the upper guideline band in any of the magnitude
categories the project shall trigger a significant air quality effect.
2.95.1
The competent expert for air quality should use the following criteria where the number of properties
resides between the lower and upper guideline bands for any of the magnitude of change criteria in
Table 2.92:
1)
the absolute concentration at each receptor; i.e. is the modelled concentration 40 µg/m3 or 60
µg/m3;
2)
how many receptors are there in each of the magnitude of change criteria; that is does the project
create more worsening than improvements?; and,
3)
the magnitude of change in concentration at each receptor, for example 0.6 µg/m3 vs 1.8 µg/m3.
2.96
Where the competent expert for air quality has deemed that the project has triggered a significant air
quality effect, a PAQAP shall be prepared setting out the measures that are required to mitigate the
effects of the project.
Designated habitats
2.97
An assessment of the impacts on designated habitats shall be completed using the outputs from the air
quality modelling.
2.98
The flow chart in Figure 2.98 shall be followed to complete the assessment of significant air quality
effects on designated habitats by a competent expert for biodiversity.

2.99
If the change in N deposition is greater than 0.4kg N/ha/yr for the project, the competent expert for
biodiversity shall review the air quality attribute target for the site to confirm whether it is 'restore' or
'maintain' and update the assessment if necessary.
2.100
The competent expert for biodiversity shall conclude whether the changes in nitrogen deposition are
likely to trigger a significant air quality effect.
2.101
The competent expert for biodiversity shall reference Table 21 in the published nitrogen deposition
dose response report by Natural England NECR210 [Ref 2.N] in their assessment of significant air
quality effects.
2.102
For designated habitats not included in Natural England's report, the habitat with the lowest change in
nitrogen deposition likely to lead to the loss of one species, excluding nutrient impoverished sand
dunes, shall be used to inform the judgement of significant air quality effects.
Evaluating the outcomes of the significance
Operation
2.103
The competent expert for air quality shall determine whether a project triggers a significant air quality
effect by assessing the following:
1)
the effects on human health;
2)
the effects on designated habitats; and,
3)
the outcomes of the compliance risk assessment.
2.104
The effects on human health, designated sites and the outcomes of the compliance risk assessment
shall be assessed to determine whether a project triggers a significant air quality effect.
2.105
The view on significance shall be supported by a statement setting out how that judgement was arrived
at, together with the supporting evidence.
Construction
2.106
The competent expert for air quality shall determine whether the effect of construction traffic from a
project triggers a significant effect by assessing the following;
1)
effects on human health;
2)
effects on designated habitats; and,
3)
the outcome of the compliance risk assessment.
NOTE
With best practice construction mitigation measures the impact of construction dust is unlikely to trigger
a significant air quality effect.
Design and mitigation
Construction
2.107
Construction dust mitigation measures for the project shall be contained within the environmental
management plan (EMP).
NOTE
There is no requirement to provide a detailed breakdown of mitigation measures within the assessment.
2.108
The construction dust assessment shall be used to inform the best practice mitigation measures in the
EMP depending on whether the project has a high or low dust risk potential.
2.108.1
Table 2.108.1 sets out the supporting activities that should be followed, based on the construction dust
risk potential, to monitor the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures to be included in the
EMP.

NOTE
In most cases monitoring for dust deposition/ambient dust would not be required given the nature of
work undertaken on the majority of the construction of road projects.
Operation
2.109
Where the air quality assessment concluded that the project triggered a significant air quality effect
and/or affected the UK's reported ability to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest
timescales possible, a project air quality action plan (PAQAP) shall be included in the air quality
assessment.
2.110
Any mitigation measures set out in the PAQAP shall:
1)
be viable; and,
2)
quantify the change in concentrations associated with the measure.
2.111
Where mitigation measures are required, the following shall be assessed for their suitability, alongside
any other proposed viable mitigation measure for the project:
1)
a vertical barrier capable of reducing the difference between the monitored / modelled
concentration for an identified section of the ARN and the required legal air quality threshold for
annual mean nitrogen dioxide (40 µ g/m³) to be achieved in the shortest timescales possible; and,
2)
speed limits adjusted for air quality.
NOTE
Speed limits for air quality can include reduction to 60 mph and enforcement at 70 mph.
2.112
The minimum level of change to be delivered by a vertical barrier shall be 5 µ g/m3 NO2 concentration
at the location of the identified qualifying feature.
2.112.1
The barrier should cover the extent of the air quality exceedences plus 80 m either end of the qualifying
feature.
2.112.2
Where it is not possible to extend the barrier by 80 m at either end, the designer should recommend
and justify an alternative length to the Overseeing Organisation.
2.113
Where a vertical barrier is required to deliver mitigation, the proposed minimum levels of change in
annual mean NO2, with the vertical barrier in place, shall to be evidenced by 'real world' air quality
monitoring.
2.114
Evidence for real world air quality monitoring shall be supported by a minimum of 6 months of air quality
monitoring, in line with published standards.
2.114.1
The proposed air quality monitoring should gather data from around the proposed barrier, and control
locations.
2.115
The analysis of the air quality monitoring data and associated reports on the performance of the
proposed measure, such as a vertical barrier, shall be undertaken by a competent expert for air quality.

NOTE
Evidence based only on wind tunnel testing and/or computational fluid dynamic modelling is not an
acceptable substitute for evidence of real world performance underpinned by air quality measurements.
2.116
Where a vertical barrier is required to deliver mitigation, it shall meet the requirements of:
1)
DMRB 'Design of minor structures' CD 354 [Ref 6.N];
2)
DMRB 'The design and appearance of highway structures' CD 351 [Ref 13.N]; and,
3)
DMRB 'Technical approval of highway structures' CG 300 [Ref 12.N].
2.117
Structural design requirements for air quality barriers shall be agreed with the Technical Approval
Authority.
NOTE
It is expected that air quality barriers will have similar design and certification requirements to noise
barriers but with heights >3 m being Category 1.
2.118
All mitigation measures shall be capable of being in place before the annual mean NO2 threshold is
predicted to be met.
2.119
The policy of the Overseeing Organisation on the purchase of properties shall be sought prior to being
considered as a possible mitigation measure.
2.120
PAQAP shall be structured in the following way:
1)
a brief description of the project;
2)
a brief description of the project impacts over the study area;
3)
list all mitigation measures that have been considered in developing the PAQAP, and split by lead
delivery authority ( i.e. Overseeing Organisation, local authority or Government) and the change
in NO2 concentrations at the effected receptors; and,
4)
a figure illustrating the single, or combination of the identified viable mitigation measures, and the
receptors they effect.
NOTE
In developing the PAQAP, adopted actions contained within the Government's National Air Quality Plan
JAQU Plan 2017 [Ref 3.I] or local measures within their local air quality plans and already included in
the traffic model for the project, cannot be included in the PAQAP as this would be double counting.
2.121
The impacts of the project shall be re-evaluated, including the proposed mitigation measure(s), to
ensure there is no longer a significant air quality effect and/or a risk to affecting the UK's reported ability
to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible.
2.122
In the event that the proposed mitigation measures are assessed not to be effective, further measures
shall be investigated and assessed and the impacts of the project re-evaluated.
Assumptions and limitations
2.123
The assumptions and limitations associated with the air quality assessment for the project shall be
included in the environmental assessment with a description of the potential influence on the model
outcomes.
NOTE
Air quality modelling like all modelling is inherently uncertain, but it is the most reliable, reasonable and
robust tool available to determine whether a project has a significant air quality effect and/or affects the
UK's reported ability to comply with the 2008/50/EC [Ref 1.N] in the shortest timescales possible.
2.124
To help manage uncertainty in air quality modelling, the modelled concentrations in the base year shall
be verified against air quality monitoring data in accordance with Defra guidance TG 16 [Ref 8.N].
2.125
The verification adjustment factors shall be applied to the modelled concentrations in the base year and
do minimum and do something scenarios in the opening year.
2.126
Uncertainty in future air quality is one of the key assumptions in air quality modelling and the approach
for addressing uncertainty in predicted future roadside NOx and NO2 trends shall be followed.

Speed banding of traffic modelled speeds for use with air quality assessments
A1.1
Background
The competent expert from the traffic team provides the competent expert for air quality with the speed
bands required to generate the vehicle emission factors for the corresponding speed band .
Speed banding ensures that speeds from the traffic model are used to reflect different states of driving
conditions with an assigned emission factor.
The speed band descriptors for motorway and urban roads are presented in Tables A.1 and A.2.
Table A.1 Motorway speed bands
Category
Speed range
(kph)
General description
Heavy
congestion
5 – 48
Traffic with a high degree of congestion and stop-start
driving behaviour, junction mergers, slip roads with queuing
traffic.
Light congestion
48 – 80
Traffic with some degree of flow breakdown, typical
volume/capacity (v/c) >80%. Normal operation on slip
roads.
Free flow
80 – 96
Motorway generally free-flow driving conditions with little or
no flow breakdown. Motorway busy but not congested, v/c <
80%.
High speed
96 - 140
Motorway unconstrained, typical of overnight conditions
when traffic light.
Table A.2 Urban speed bands
Category
Speed range
(kph)
General description
Heavy
congestion
5 – 20
Traffic with a high degree of congestion. Within a 100-m
radius of road junction with a high degree of congestion.
Light congestion
20 – 45
Typical urban traffic with a reasonable degree of congestion.
Within a 100-m radius of road junction.
Free flow
45 – 80
Typical urban traffic with limited or no congestion.
High speed
80 - 112
High speed urban single or dual carriageway.
The speed pivoting methodology is only to be applied to road links included in the traffic reliability area
(TRA) and for only those road links used in the air quality assessment.
A proportionate approach to the speed pivoting process is required, e.g. if there is no possibility of
exceedances of air quality thresholds, or the air quality assessment is at options stage for the project
using AADT traffic data, then speed pivoting is not required.
For early stages of project development it is not necessary to undertake the full speed pivoting process,
particularly where the traffic models are likely to be updated. The amount of detail required for the
speed banding is proportionate to the stage of the assessment.

LA 105 Version 0.1.0
Appendix A. Speed pivoting methodology
Where significant risks to air quality have been identified during the early stages of a project, which
could risk a delay to project delivery, it is necessary to undertake selective speed pivoting in the area of
concern.
A1.2
Speed pivoting process
Observed vehicle speeds at a link level will need to be obtained for the traffic model base year from
data sets such as TrafficMaster, GPS, mobile phone data, etc.
The observed traffic speeds along the road links provided for use in the air quality assessment need to
be obtained for the base year and averaged over the period corresponding to the same period in the air
quality model.
For a detailed air quality assessment, the air quality model is generally broken down into four periods to
represent the change in emissions over the day (AM, IP, PM and OP). The AM period, for example,
generally represents a 3-hour period 07:00 until 10:00.
The traffic model network and the network used for the observed speeds are likely to be different, as a
result, the data needs to be processed so that the observed speeds are comparable geographically
with the traffic-modelled road links.
The factor generated between the comparison of the base year modelled speed and the observed
speed, known as the speed pivot factor (SP) (i.e. SP = speed observed in base year/speed modelled in
base year), will need to be calculated and used to adjust the individual base year and forecast year link
speeds output from the traffic model.
It is recognised that observed speed data is not always available for every road link in the traffic model
and consequently an 'infilling' process will be required to pivot the modelled traffic speeds on these
road links.
For those road links and/or times of day when observed speeds are not available infilling needs to be
undertaken whereby an SP on roads representative of the link with no observed speeds is used.
The infilling process can be informed by considering, for example, the speed pivoting performance on
adjacent links, the speed pivoting performance on roads with similar characteristics either in the local
area or globally across the TRA if available, e.g. motorways, urban centre roads, single carriageways,
and rural roads.
Where there is no observed speed, i.e. the link is a new road (e.g. bypass) the modelled speed needs
to be used to generate the speed band.
Where the speed pivot factors are high then it may not be appropriate to apply these to the forecast
speeds as any change (between assessment scenarios) would be magnified and/or the result in
speeds being greater than the speed limit of the road.
In these circumstances a judgement should be made by the competent expert for traffic to determine
whether the traffic conditions are likely to have changed because of the project from the base year.
If the competent expert for traffic deems the traffic conditions observed for the base year are not likely
to significantly change in the forecasts years, then the base year speed band needs to be used and the
reasoning behind the judgement recorded.
The speed bands are to be plotted in GIS to check the speed bands spatially in the forecast years to
identify any anomalies in the generated speed bands. This will be useful for example to determine
whether there are changes in speed bands along the same section of motorway which may be because
of very small changes in speed.
Where speed bands have changed between the do minimum and do something scenarios, the bands
need to be checked to ensure that the change in band can be justified because of the project.
This analysis however needs to focus on areas identified as sensitive to changes in air quality that may
result in exceedances of air quality thresholds to ensure it is proportionate.

LA 105 Version 0.1.0
Appendix A. Speed pivoting methodology
Very small changes in speed between modelled scenarios will not always necessitate a change in
speed band. It is important that the speed banding process is not just a numerical process whereby the
speed ranges are put into the respective bands with no sense-checking of the bands that the links have
been allocated to.
The receptor concentrations modelled in the base year by the competent air quality expert will provide
an indication of the areas that are sensitive to change and hence require greater analysis in relation to
changes in speed bands as a result of the project.
