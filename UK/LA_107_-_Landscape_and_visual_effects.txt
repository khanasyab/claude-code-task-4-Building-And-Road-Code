Introduction
Introduction
Background
Construction, improvement, operation and maintenance of motorways and all-purpose trunk roads can
result in environmental effects on landscape and the visual amenity.
Development of this document has been influenced by:
1) the UK Government's commitment in ratification of the European Landscape Convention ELC 2000
[Ref 10.N] (hereafter referred to as the Convention), to recognising landscape matters in law, and
promoting landscape planning, protection, and management policies;
2) the Convention's ELC 2000 [Ref 10.N] widely adopted definition of landscape which recognises:
a) landscape as a resource inclusive of townscape;
b) the relationship between people and place; and
c) all landscapes are important, irrespective of their location (i.e. natural, rural, urban, and
peri-urban areas) or condition (i.e. outstanding or degraded);
3) Landscape Institute and IEMA's Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment GLVIA
[Ref 1.I]; and
4) Landscape Institute's Technical Information Notes (i.e. Townscape Character Assessment, LI TN
05/2017 [Ref 3.I], Landscape Character Assessment, ( Technical Info Note 08/15 [Ref 2.I]) and their
visualisation information guidance (Advice on photography and photomontages, and Visual
representation of development proposals, TGN 06/19 [Ref 4.I]).
This document aligns with Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU [Ref 3.N]
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] apply to this document.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements in this document shall be applied to the assessment, reporting and management of
environmental effects on landscape and visual amenity from the delivery of projects.
1.2
Environmental assessments shall describe the likely impacts on the landscape as a resource, and
visual amenity in line with the wider requirements and advice provided in;
1) LA 101 [Ref 6.N] Introduction to environmental assessment;
2) LA 102 [Ref 9.N] Screening projects for Environmental Impact Assessment;
3) LA 103 [Ref 8.N] Scoping projects for environment assessment; and
4) LA 104 [Ref 4.N] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
1.3
Environmental assessments must, in accordance with Annex IV of the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU
2014/52/EU [Ref 3.N], identify, describe and assess the likely significant effects of a project on the
landscape (i.e. the direct and indirect change to the landscape character, the landscape
quality/condition, and the visual amenity and visual receptors).
NOTE 1
In undertaking landscape and visual assessment (LVIA), an understanding of the interaction between
environmental factors and their effect on landscape elements (i.e. individual parts of the landscape
such as human influences, land cover and physical influences) is necessary, see GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref
1.I].
NOTE 2
The LVIA process does not differentiate between "landscape" and "townscape", as it is applicable to
any landscape - urban, rural or a combination of both, see GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 3
For townscape assessment the Landscape Institute have developed a Technical Information Note (TIN)
"Townscape Character Assessment" specifically for undertaking a character assessment for
"townscape" LI TN 05/2017 [Ref 3.I].
1.4
LVIA shall be clear about the distinction between the following two elements:
1) effects on the landscape as a resource; and
2) effects on views and visual amenity.
NOTE 1
Effects on landscapes of historical, cultural or archaeological significance are assessed in LA 106 [Ref
2.N] Cultural heritage assessment.
NOTE 2
Effects on nature conservation and biodiversity are assessed in LA 108 [Ref 1.N] and LA 115 [Ref 5.N]
Habitats Regulations assessment.
Implementation
1.5
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all projects involving landscape and visual effects on
the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk road network according to the
implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 7.N].
Use of GG 101
1.6
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

LA 107 Revision 2
2. Principles and purpose
2.
Principles and purpose
Assessment and consultation
2.1
The iterative planning, design and assessment process shall include analysis of the landscape and
character of a site as well as its visual amenity and its context to minimise landscape and visual effects.
2.2
Landscape design shall seek:
1) to deliver excellence in design quality that responds to the needs of people and places, while
complying with the Overseeing Organisation's design vision and principles; and
2) to deliver an inclusive, resilient and sustainable design solution.
2.3
LVIA, as a key tool to effective decision making that includes landscape character assessment, shall be
undertaken by a Landscape Architect.
2.4
Baseline studies shall establish the landscape and visual conditions, potential constraints (i.e. sensitive
landscapes - designated sites or locally valued areas) and possible design opportunities (i.e. use of
existing land-form/topography to better integrate the design) to inform the design process.
2.5
LVIA application of the term 'sensitivity', as defined in terms and definitions, shall be applied throughout
this document.
2.6
Assessment of the project's potential effects against the baseline situation shall examine and assess:
1) seasonal differences with or without the project including summer with foliage and winter without
foliage;
2) both day and night time situations with or without the project;
3) a winter scenario in the year of opening, and a summer scenario - fifteenth year of operation to traffic;
4) landscape character types and/or landscape character areas; and
5) the opinions and consensus of the local public and different interest groups, their perception of the
landscape, the value they place it and assessment of the change the project will incur.
2.7
The effect of a project on the landscape and visual amenity shall be assessed independently and the
outcome combined to a single conclusion of the likely significant effect on landscape and visual amenity.
2.8
Consultation about the impact on the landscape and visual amenity shall be undertaken in accordance
with the the Overseeing Organisation's requirements and LA 104 [Ref 4.N] and LA 103 [Ref 8.N].
NOTE 1
Consultation includes stakeholders likely to be affected by the project, or are aware of certain
information or issues to assist the design and assessment (i.e. concerns regarding local sensitivity).
NOTE 2
Consultation includes the appropriate statutory body responsible for primary, definitive source of policy,
information and opinion on statutory protected landscape.
2.9
Qualitative judgements used in landscape impact assessment and visual impact assessment shall be
clear and transparent so as the reasoning applied at different stages can be understood.
NOTE
Aspects of LVIA are objective (i.e. landscape character assessment), however, many require
professional judgement (i.e. determining landscape quality or condition, ascertaining magnitude level of
change).

Assessment methodology
Overview
3.1
LVIA shall identify and assess the significance of and the effects of change of a project on the
landscape as a resource, and people's views and visual amenity as part of the iterative steps in
assessment and design development, GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
3.2
LVIA whether undertaken as part of a statutory Environmental Impact Assessment or non-statutory
environmental assessment shall apply to all projects and be informed by these key iterative steps:
1) defining the purpose and scope of assessment;

LA 107 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
3.4
The assessment of the likely significant effects shall be informed by:
1) the sensitivity of the landscape receptor (susceptibility to changes combined with value of the
receptor) and the magnitude of effects on the landscape (change - scale, extent, duration); and
2) the sensitivity of a visual receptor (susceptibility to changes in views combined with values of the
receptor) and magnitude of effects (change - scale, extent, duration) GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
3.4.1
The assessment of susceptibility to change should be tailored to the project.
NOTE
A possible example could be where receptors with prominent views towards the highway infrastructure
are more likely to have a low susceptibility to change of a project, than receptors with no existing views
towards the highway infrastructure which are more likely to have a high susceptibility to change.
3.4.2
Assessment and reporting of the impacts on the landscape resource, and views and visual amenity
from temporary construction works, should follow the wider advice and requirements found in LA 104
[Ref 4.N].
3.5
Baseline information (desk based studies, consultation, field studies) shall be informed by:
1) identifying the local and wider landscape likely to be affected (i.e. character, condition, constituent
elements, experience of it, geographical extent, history, its value);
2) identifying the different landscape and visual receptors likely to be affected;
3) identifying the visual amenity and views likely to be affected (i.e. ZTV to identify areas visibly
connected with the proposal); and
4) utilising data obtained from a range of relevant sources (i.e. statutory environmental bodies, local
authorities, and/or National Park Authorities).
3.5.1
Visualisation (i.e. computer simulation, digital technology, photographs, photomontages, etc.) is
important in communicating information and should be proportionate and accord with the Overseeing
Organisation's requirements.
3.6
An overall assessment of the likely significance of the cumulative landscape and visual effects required
by LVIA shall provide clear evidence and justifications as to inform the professional judgements made.
3.7
Overlaps in assessment shall be identified and clearly cross-referenced as to where the assessment is
being reported.
NOTE
For example, the installation of noise screening can have visual implications whereas screen planting
can disturb archaeological remains or conflict with wildlife considerations.
Assessment of landscape effects
Scoping
3.8
LVIA scoping assessment shall identify and report on:
1) the likely nature, extent and scale of the project to determine effects of change and development;
2) the likely nature and scale of landscape effects (positive, neutral or negative) during the construction
and operation of the project;
3) the likelihood of the project to affect the aesthetic and perceptual aspects of the landscape, its
distinctive character and its elements; and
4) issues likely to require further assessment together with the methods to be applied.
3.9
The scoping assessment shall identify potential significant effects by answering the following questions
to gain an understanding of the need to undertake further landscape assessment:
1) is the project likely to affect designated landscapes (statutory or local designation)?;
2) is the project likely to affect the distinctiveness of a landscape character area or type?;
3) is the project likely to affect national, regional or local characteristics or distinctive features?;

4) is the project likely to affect the condition or quality of a landscape?;
5) is the project likely to affect the intrinsic character, qualities and local identity of the urban
environment (sense of place)?
3.10
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
NOTE
A positive response to the queries above would indicate potential significant effects.
Study area
3.11
The study area shall be identified on a project by project basis and be proportionate to the following
factors:
1) the project boundary/construction activity (including compounds and temporary land take);
2) the wider landscape setting within which the project/its works has the potential to influence;
3) the extent of the area visible by the project; and
4) the full extent of adjacent or affected landscape receptors of special value (i.e. conservation areas,
designated areas) whose setting can be influenced by the project.
Baseline scenario
3.12
The scale of landscape character assessment information required to provide a basis for LVIA shall be
established at the outset.
3.13
Baseline studies, appropriate and proportionate to the context of the project, shall establish the relative
value of the areas of landscape to be affected, either as a whole or individual components that
contribute to its character.
3.14
Baseline studies shall identify important characteristics of the landscape including:
1) a description of the landscape receptors that make up the landscape to include night-time
characteristics, geological, habitat, as well as historic and cultural landscape features;
2) a description of the aesthetic and perceptual characteristics contributing to the landscape's
distinctive character (i.e.pattern, scale, tranquillity, wildness);
3) the condition or quality of the landscape;
4) its importance and/or value (i.e. national parks, Special Landscape Areas (SLAs), local importance
or value); and
5) influences of past and future trends and forces for landscape change (i.e. current pressures causing
change, future developments with planning permission, climate change).
3.15
Site surveys shall be appropriate/proportionate to confirm, supplement and update the baseline data
obtained (i.e. reports, mapping, aerial photographs) for assessing landscape effects, GLVIA 3 GLVIA
[Ref 1.I].
Assessment
3.16
Landscape assessment shall judge the nature of receptors likely to be affected (sensitivity), and the
nature of effects likely to occur on the landscape (magnitude) to report on a project's likely significant
effects.
3.17
Landscape character assessment, the key tool to understanding the landscape, shall describe the
variation in the landscape's character against the baseline, explaining a project's likely effect on a
combination of landscape components, which include:
1) natural/physical (i.e. geology/soils, land form, river/drainage systems, land cover/vegetation,
buildings);
2) aesthetic/perceptual (i.e. appearance, architectural styles, scales, tranquillity), and

LA 107 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
3.25
The approach to deriving impact significance from receptor/resource sensitivity (susceptibility and
value) and magnitude of effects shall be in accordance with the Table 'Significance categories and
typical descriptions', set out in the Environmental assessment methodology section of LA 104 [Ref 4.N].
3.26
The approach to deriving impact significance from landscape sensitivity and magnitude of effects shall
be based on the significance matrix within the Environmental assessment methodology section of LA
104 [Ref 4.N] and include evidence to support any professional judgements that have been made.
3.26.1
For landscape, LVIA's term for sensitivity should apply to read - 'Landscape sensitivity (susceptibility
and value)' instead of 'Environmental value (sensitivity)', as set out in the Environmental assessment
methodology section of LA 104 [Ref 4.N].
3.27
Reporting the assessment shall state whether or not a project is likely to give rise to significant
landscape effects and the significance of the effect (i.e. large or slight, adverse or beneficial, temporary
or permanent).
NOTE
Significant effects comprise of effects that are/remain within the moderate, large or very large
categories once design development has identified the necessary mitigation to be taken into account.
Assessment of visual effects
Scoping
3.28
Visual impact scoping assessment shall identify and report on:
1) the likely nature, extent and scale of the project to determine effects of change and development;
2) the likely nature and scale of effects (positive, neutral or negative) on views and visual receptors
during the construction and operation of the project;
3) the likelihood of the project to result in significant visual effects; and
4) issues likely to require further assessment together with the methods to be applied.
3.28.1
The assessment scope, to include identification of representative viewpoints and/or visual receptors
should, in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's requirements, be agreed with the relevant
local authority.
3.29
The scoping assessment shall identify likely significant effects by answering the following questions to
gain an understanding of the need to undertake further visual assessment:
1) is the project likely to affect receptors (individuals or range of people) views and the visual amenity
of the area?;
2) is the project likely to affect the sensitivity of views to and from designated and/or valued
landscapes, or from public rights of ways, public open spaces or from national trials?;
3) is the project likely to affect a range of viewpoints and nature of views from which the project is
visible?;
4) is the project likely to generate significant visual effects (daytime and night time)?
3.30
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
Study area
3.31
The study area shall be identified on a project by project basis and proportionate to the following factors:
1) the project/construction visual footprint (including compounds and temporary land take);
2) the wider visual envelope within which the project has the potential to influence;
3) the extent of representative viewpoints visible of the project; and
4) the extent of adjacent or affected visual receptors and the visual amenity of the area that can be
influenced by the project.

LA 107 Revision 2
3. Assessment methodology
3.32
The study area and selection of viewpoints shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE 1
Viewpoints selected for assessment and illustration of visual effects fall into three broad categories:
1) representative viewpoints - represents the experience of different types of visual receptors, where
large numbers of viewpoints cannot be included individually, with similar (unlikely to differ) significant
effects;
2) specific viewpoints - key and sometimes promoted viewpoints in noteworthy areas; and
3) illustrative viewpoints - to demonstrate a particular effect or specific issue, GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
Actual visibility can depend on such visual obstructions as buildings, topography, tree cover, as well as
elevation, direction and distance of views and light and weather conditions, GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
3.33
Relevant local authorities shall be consulted on the study area and selection of viewpoints early in the
assessment process.
3.33.1
The study area, using digital methods to identify the ZVI or ZTV, should include the whole of the area
from which any part of the proposed project can be visible.
NOTE
Map products ZVI or ZTV, are commonly referred to as ZTV with the latter being the desk study
component of visibility analysis and used throughout in reference to land from which the proposal could
theoretically be visible, GLVIA 3 GLVIA [Ref 1.I].
Baseline scenario
3.34
The baseline shall establish the various categories of visual receptors, their locations and quantity, as
well as the sensitivity of each, focusing on information that helps to identify significant visual effects.
3.34.1
Viewpoints selected should be informed not only through discussions with local authorities, but by the
ZTV analysis and fieldwork and take account of:
1) accessibility to the public;
2) number and sensitivity of viewers who can be affected;
3) viewing direction, distance (i.e short, medium or long distance views) and elevation;
4) nature of the viewing experience;
5) view type; and
6) cumulative views in conjunction with other projects.
3.35
The ZTV identified for linear infrastructure projects, such as roads, shall be constructed for a sequence
of points along the road with heights of structures (i.e. bridges and gantries) and vehicles along with
existing screening features built into it to better demonstrate visibility of all aspects.
3.35.1
Mapping existing screening features identified (i.e. tree lines, woodland, industrial/large buildings, etc.)
in the ZTV to assist the visibility analysis is difficult to achieve accurately, therefore field surveys should
be used to judge their effects.
NOTE
The Landscape Institute's advice on photography and photomontage, technical guidance note on
visualisation TGN 06/19 [Ref 4.I], together with advice on visual effects within GLVIA 3 ( GLVIA [Ref
1.I]), provide information for what can be required for assessment and presentation purposes.
3.36
ZTVs, determined by computer analysis, shall be site verified to ensure accuracy and applicability.
3.36.1
Separate ZTVs may be required in certain circumstances for a project to facilitate determination of the
degree of change resulting from the project.
3.36.2
ZTVs should be undertaken under the guidance of or by a Landscape Architect with an understanding
of the requirements in undertaking these together with detailed knowledge of the project proposals.
Assessment
3.37
Visual assessment shall record the degree of change in the composition of the view from that which
would exist without the project to that which would result as a consequence of the project.

In determining the magnitude of visual effect (degree of change), it should be agreed prior whether just
listing what has been taken into consideration is sufficient or whether some additional explanation is
required for clarity.
Cumulative effects
3.47
Cumulative effects, as set out in LA 104 [Ref 4.N] shall establish a project's consequences on key
landscape characteristics and visual amenity by examining links between landscape and visual effects,
as well as effects identified in other factors (intra-project) and between projects (inter-project).
Design and mitigation
3.48
Design and mitigation hierarchy outlined in LA 104 [Ref 4.N] Environmental assessment and monitoring
shall be applied to avoid, reduce or remediate (offset) potential effects on the landscape, views and
visual amenity.
3.49
Landscape design shall seek to:
1) reflect the beauty of the natural, built and historic environment through which it passes; and
2) avoid likely significant effects by taking account of the importance and sensitivity of the landscape
resource, of views and the visual amenity, their susceptibility and value, to avoid likely significant
effects.
3.49.1
Where effects cannot be avoided through alignment/design choices, a mitigation strategy should be
developed to reduce the potential effects.
Enhancement
3.50
The LVIA process shall identify enhancement opportunities to form an integral part of project design for
improving, reconstructing, and/or restoring the local landscape character and/or visual amenity.

4. Monitoring
4.
Monitoring
4.1
In addition to the requirements found in LA 104 [Ref 4.N], monitoring shall determine the effectiveness
of delivery of mitigation measures linked to the landscape or screening commitments agreed as part of
the assessment process.
4.2
A handover environmental management plan (HEMP) and/or landscape management plan (LMP), as
part of an EMP, shall set out the landscape mitigation measures and commitments agreed to and
delivered, together with specific management and/or monitoring requirements over a set period of time
stated.
NOTE
A HEMP is an iterative document to be continually updated during the initial environmental and
landscape establishment period (aftercare period) and to form the basis for a LMP to agree the
management requirements during the routine management period.
4.3
Monitoring results shall be reported to the Overseeing Organisation and used to update the LMP
identifying any necessary non-conforming or remedial actions to be undertaken and the agreed time
frame to complete them in.
