NOTE 3
Where there are DTS, it is notable that some structures installed prior to the year 2000 contain
asbestos.
NOTE 4
The process and procedures for asbestos management are held within GG 105 [Ref 1.N].
4.44
The duct route shall maximise the use of existing viable DTS for roadside technology and
communications.
4.44.1
The viability of existing DTS for roadside technology and communications should be determined by the
proximity to the duct route, the proved condition and capacity for new cables.
4.45
Where the condition of an existing DTS for roadside technology and communications is unfit for reuse
or there is capacity constraints, one of the following options shall be chosen:
1)
Option 1: sub-duct the DTS;
2)
Option 2: use an alternative existing DTS; or
3)
Option 3: provision of a new DTS.
4.45.1
Option 1 should be applied where an existing DTS for roadside technology and communications is fit
for re-use and there is no capacity constraints.
4.46
There shall be chambers at the demarcation point between DTS and longitudinal or local ducts for
roadside technology and communications.
4.46.1
DTS for roadside technology and communications should connect to ducts, via chambers such that a
continuous duct route is formed.
NOTE
DTS are integral elements of the structure in which they are located.
4.47
Sub-ducts for roadside technology and communications shall be installed to bridge interfaces between
variations in duct diameter and allow a continuous run between interface chambers either side of the
structure.
NOTE
Some existing structures contain ducts that are smaller in diameter than standard longitudinal ducts,
which are often truncated at the edge of the structure.
4.48
The physical transition between ducts in the soft verge and DTS for roadside technology and
communications shall be implemented such that cables can be safely installed through the DTS without
damage to the cables or the ducts.
4.49
