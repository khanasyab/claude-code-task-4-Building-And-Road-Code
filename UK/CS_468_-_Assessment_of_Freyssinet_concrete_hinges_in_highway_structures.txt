Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides requirements and advice for the assessment of existing Freyssinet concrete
hinges in highway structures. This document supersedes BE 5/75, which has been withdrawn.
Concrete hinges provide release of bending moment in a member by their action which approximates
to a pin connection. The pin action is achieved by notching the member to form a throat which
transmits axial and shear forces while relieving the bending moments. Concrete hinges have been in
use since the end of the nineteenth century, with different types of hinges used to transmit the member
forces through the throat.
Freyssinet hinges make use of the high compressive strength which is developed in the throat due to
the tri-axial confinement of the concrete so that there is no primary structural requirement for
reinforcement to pass through the throat. Freyssinet hinges were first used on the Chandelier Bridge in
1923 Freyssinet 1923 [Ref 4.I].
Design models for Freyssinet concrete hinges have been developed in Germany, Sweden, Great
Britain, France and the Netherlands (see Proc ICE Paper 1400020 [Ref 2.I]).
In the early 1960's, the Cement and Concrete Association (now the Concrete Society) published
research, undertaken by Base, into Freyssinet hinges which included extensive laboratory testing, as
reported in CCA TRA 359 [Ref 6.I] and CCA Research Report No. 17 [Ref 5.I]. Based on the
experimental results, Sims & Bridle 1964 [Ref 7.I] developed empirical rules for the design of Freyssinet
concrete hinges, which were later used in England for the design of some bridges on the M1 motorway
Proc ICE Paper 1400020 [Ref 2.I]. During this period concrete hinges were also used on many other
bridges as support members and rocker bearings.
In 1975, the Highways Agency (now Highways England) published the technical memorandum BE
5/75, 'Rules for the design and use of Freyssinet concrete hinges in highway structures'. BE 5/75 was
based on the model for calculation developed by Sims & Bridle 1964 [Ref 7.I] from tests by Base CCA
TRA 359 [Ref 6.I].
The concrete hinge is an area of high stress concentration which is densely reinforced in the end
blocks. The reinforcement and the highly profiled geometry of the notch create difficulty to achieve the
required level of compaction of the concrete. The load bearing capacity strongly depends on the ability
of the tensile reinforcement in the end blocks to resist the tensile splitting forces. Reinforcement across
the hinge throat is not necessary under the multi-axial state of stress in the throat. Excessive
reinforcement disturbs the state of stress in the hinge throat and can lead to shrinkage cracks as shown
by Base in CCA TRA 359 [Ref 6.I], cited in Proc ICE Paper 1400020 [Ref 2.I].
The existing Freyssinet concrete hinges on motorway and all purpose trunk road bridges in England
have generally been shown to be structurally reliable to date. Concrete hinges themselves require low
maintenance and can therefore be very durable if designed and constructed properly (see Marx &
Schacht 2010 [Ref 1.I]).
However, the hinge areas are vulnerable to cracking and concrete spalling which may lead to water
ingress and subsequent corrosion of the reinforcement. Past inspections have recorded instances of
sub-standard workmanship, difficulty to gain access for inspection, hinges being buried below ground
level, issues related with tension in hinges, and non-compliant throat details.
Concrete hinges are also vulnerable in lateral shear due to vehicle collision forces. The assessment
values of collision forces as given in CS 453 [Ref 7.N] have increased significantly since the
introduction of the concrete hinges.
BE 5/75, which was primarily a design document, has been applied to previous assessments of
concrete hinges via departures from standard, necessary because of the limitations of BE 5/75 which
can be summarised as follows:
1) BE 5/75 was written as a working stress document, prior to the introduction of limit state design;

CS 468 Revision 1
Introduction
2) BE 5/75 addressed a specific design configuration with a rectangular shaped throat for a limited
range of material properties;
3) BE 5/75 proposed a theory which is shown to be adequate for the prescribed design configuration
but not readily adaptable to other configurations; and,
4) the complex behaviour of the concrete within and around the hinge not being addressed in detail.
The use of concrete hinges in new design is not permitted, unless there is absolutely no alternative
solution, such as in situations where the articulation of an existing the bridge being widened has to be
maintained. In such cases, the hinges are required to be designed to be accessible for inspection and
maintenance CD 350 [Ref 8.N].
In 1977, Crossley published design recommendations for circular hinges which included full scale
laboratory testing Crossley 1977 [Ref 3.I]. Crossley proposed design charts based on experiments and
compared his results by adapting the theory from BE 5/75. This update of BE 5/75 has incorporated the
design recommendations by Crossley for use in the assessment of existing circular hinges.
A critical review on concrete hinges was carried out by who compared the different theories in common
use worldwide. While the theory in BE 5/75 had some limitations, it was seen to be adequate within the
available knowledge.
This document updates and adapts BE 5/75 for use in the assessments of concrete rectangular and
circular hinges. The findings from research studies published after the publication of BE 5/75, as well
as provisions from previous departures from standards relating to the assessment of concrete hinges,
have been incorporated as appropriate.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 "Introduction to the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges".

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the assessment of existing Freyssinet concrete hinges with:
1) rectangular or circular throat section; and,
2) profiled notch geometry.
NOTE
Refer to Appendix A - Figure A.1 for typical illustrations of a rectangular hinge block and definitions of
terminology.
1.2
This document shall be used for concrete hinges:
1) with no reinforcement through the throat; or,
2) in which the area of reinforcement through the throat of the hinge does not exceed 5% of the cross
sectional area of the throat.
NOTE 1
Freyssinet concrete hinges assume that reinforcement through the throat of the hinge does not
participate to transmit forces through the throat.
NOTE 2
Excessive reinforcement disturbs the state of stress in the throat and can cause shrinkage cracks in the
hinge throat.
1.3
This document shall be used where the concrete cube strength is not less than 30 N/mm2 for the hinge
throat and end blocks.
NOTE
A minimum concrete cube strength of 30 N/mm2 is required, based on testing, for the assumed action
of splitting the end blocks and the development of high confined strengths at the throat.
1.4
Rotation of the rectangular section hinge shall be only in one plane, that is about the longitudinal axis.
1.5
This document shall apply to concrete hinges with:
1) throat width within the range of 50mm - 250mm; and,
2) throat height less than half the width, up to a maximum of 50mm.
1.6
This document shall not be used for the assessment of:
1) bridge with deck hinges; or,
2) hinges with no primary requirement to carry axial forces.
NOTE
The structural assessment of deck hinges is covered in CS 467 [Ref 4.N].
Implementation
1.7
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the assessment of existing
Freyssinet concrete hinges in highway structures on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 3.N].
1.8
Where this document duplicates or covers the requirements in existing standards during a period of
co-existence, it shall take precedence unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
Use of GG 101
1.9
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

Inspection and material properties
General
2.1
Inspection of highway structures which include concrete hinges shall be carried out in accordance with
CS 450 [Ref 2.N], CS 454 [Ref 1.N] and as given in this section.
Hinge inspection
2.2
Where accessible, hinge positions shall be inspected for signs of deterioration, for example due to
water ingress and corrosion of the reinforcement.
NOTE 1
The throat concrete is not always visible where:
1) the entire hinge is buried below ground; or,
2) material used for notching the faces of the throat was left in place after construction.
NOTE 2
Previous inspections have noted wood and filler board used as hinge notch former on some structures.
2.3
The hinge positions shall be examined for:
1) evidence of cracking across the throat;
2) spalling of concrete in the throat; and,
3) transverse cracking on the end blocks adjacent to the throat.
NOTE 1
Cracking of the concrete at the hinge is not a sign of failure of the hinge, but it is essential to limit water
ingress to prevent corrosion of reinforcement.
NOTE 2
Spalling of concrete is acceptable where it is not progressive into the throat.
NOTE 3
Cracking generally occurs in the end blocks in areas where the tensile reinforcement provided cannot
resist the tensile splitting forces.
2.4
The concrete in the throat area shall be inspected for local deformation or heave due to poor quality of
workmanship around the hinge position.
NOTE 1
Tension cracking of the throat can have implications on the long term performance of concrete hinges.
NOTE 2
Deviations in the surface of the hinge throat are an indication of poor quality workmanship at the time of
construction.
NOTE 3
The concrete in the end blocks adjacent to the hinge throat is reinforced and profiled. Heavy
reinforcement can lead to substandard workmanship at construction due to lack of compaction,
particularly where standard sized 20mm aggregate has been used. The recommendation was for the
use of 10mm aggregate in the construction to ensure good compaction of the concrete.
2.4.1
The hinge may be assumed to have been propped prior to the application of permanent loading, unless
otherwise stated in the construction history.
NOTE
Hinges had to be supported during construction from the time of casting to the completion of the
structure incorporating the throat to prevent rotation of the throat.
2.5
Where the hinge positions are buried or inaccessible for inspection, the structure shall be surveyed to
establish any sign of movement or distress which has been caused by collapse of the hinge.
NOTE 1
Failure of the hinge throat is likely to cause distress or displacement elsewhere on the bridge
superstructure. As structures with these hinges were built over 30 years ago, defects of this nature are
apparent if a failure of the hinge is occurring or has occurred. The failure mode of the throat is expected
to be gradual.
NOTE 2
Signs of movement or distress caused by collapse or rotation of the hinge can include displacement of
the bridge joint and cracking of the carriageway surfacing over the hinged support and around the joint,
respectively.

CS 468 Revision 1
2. Inspection and material properties
2.5.1
Where signs of movement are detected in a buried or inaccessible hinge position, the position should
be exposed for further inspection.
Hinge geometry
2.6
Hinges covered by this document shall be rectangular or circular.
2.7
For rectangular hinges, where the notches of hinges have a curved profile, the effective throat width, a1
, or , effective length, b1 , shall be taken as the actual as-built dimensions recorded for the throat width,
a , the throat length, b , respectively a1 = a or b1 = b .
2.8
For circular hinges, where the notches of hinges have a curved profile, the effective diameter, d1 , shall
be taken as the actual as-built dimension recorded for the throat diameter, d .
2.9
Where the notches of hinges have straight profiles, the effective throat width, a1 , effective length, b1, or
effective diameter, d1 , shall be taken as the as-built dimension reduced by the throat height, t .
a1 = a −t , b1 = b −t , or d1 = d −t .
NOTE 1
Appendix A - Figure A.3 illustrates a typical elevation showing formation of a V-notch on a circular
hinge with a straight profiled throat.
NOTE 2
Full scale testing has shown that limited spalling of the concrete occurs across the width of the throat
with a straight profile at serviceability limit state, to form a curved notch profile.
2.10
For rectangular hinges, the throat length shall include a minimum recess of 75mm between the throat
and member edge at either end as shown in Appendix A - Figure A.2.
NOTE
Full scale testing has shown that spalling occurs along either end of the length of a rectangular throat to
an extent of 75mm from the member edge where no recess already exists.
2.11
Where spalling already exists, the effective width or length shall equal the intact measured dimension.
Material properties
Concrete
2.12
The characteristic or worst credible concrete cube strength for use in the assessment shall be
determined in accordance with CS 455 [Ref 6.N].
2.13
The maximum concrete cube strength for the assessment of concrete hinges shall not be greater than
52.5 N/mm2.
NOTE
The assessment resistance model and rules developed from experimental results are applicable for
hinges with a concrete cube strength up to of 52.5 N/mm2.
2.14
The short term elastic modulus of elasticity shall be determined in accordance with CS 455 [Ref 6.N].

3. Assessment
3.
Assessment
General
3.1
Assessment of highway structures which include concrete hinges shall be in accordance with CS 454
[Ref 1.N], CS 455 [Ref 6.N], CS 453 [Ref 7.N] and as given in this section.
Hinge analysis
3.2
The assessment of concrete hinges shall be carried out at serviceability limit state.
NOTE 1
The serviceability limit state is characterised by the onset of water ingress to cause corrosion of the
reinforcement as a result of:
1) cracking across the throat due to tension or lift-off;
2) progressive spalling at the throat due to concrete crushing; or
3) transverse cracking of the end blocks due to the normal force from the hinge causing splitting.
NOTE 2
Experimental tests on concrete hinges have shown that ultimate failure of the concrete in the throat
which occurs at high stresses up to 6fcu is difficult to predict due to the complex stress configurations in
the notch area.
NOTE 3
The methods for the assessment of resistance for rectangular and circular hinges at serviceability limit
state used in this section have been derived from the empirical and experimental assumptions in
Appendix B.
3.3
Allowance for deterioration and condition factor for assessment of resistance shall be determined in
accordance with CS 455 [Ref 6.N].
3.4
Elastic analysis of the structure shall be carried out to determine the forces in the hinge and the
coexistent hinge rotations under the loading in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.N] and CS 455 [Ref 6.N].
3.5
The rotation per unit axial load shall be determined for each condition of loading including the most
lightly loaded condition.
NOTE
The maximum value of rotation per unit axial load can occur under the most lightly loaded condition.
3.6
Analysis shall be carried out for load combinations in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
3.7
Where existing Freyssinet concrete hinge supports are vulnerable to the effects of vehicular collision
forces, they shall be assessed in accordance with CS 453 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE

Rectangular hinge
Experimental work and tests supported the development of the design approach in the withdrawn
Technical Memorandum (Bridges) Rules for the Design and Use of Freyssinet Concrete Hinges in
Highway Structures (BE 5/75) which was published by Highways Agency. Those experimental work
and tests are referenced herein and form the basis for the assumptions on the rotation and stress
distribution at the hinge throat for the assessment of rectangular hinges.
For the hinge to sustain large rotations without causing tensile stress in the throat, the width of the
throat has to be assessed in relation to the required rotation. The experimental work showed that the
behaviour of the concrete is elastic for short term loading and that under long term loading the creep is
proportional to the initial stress.
It is therefore possible to calculate from elastic considerations the rotation, ϕ which if rapidly applied,
causes annulment of the compression on one side of the throat. See Figure B.1.

Figure B.1 Rotation and stress distribution at the throat
The stress distribution across the throat for an axial compressive load is of the form shown in Figure
B.1, the maximum stresses being at the sides of the throat.
Tests showed that if this maximum stress is defined as
kN
a1b1 then the notch factor, k , may be taken to be
1.5 for the range of tests carried out (i.e., for the throat widths up to 250 mm). This covers the range
within which hinges have been used in highway bridges. Therefore maximum direct stress can be
expressed as 1.5N
a1b1
Let σb = the extreme fibre bending stress due to a superimposed moment in the hinge; then

R = Eϕ
he
or σb = ± Ea1ϕ
2he
For no tensile stresses in the throat the maximum direct compressive stress at the sides has to be
greater or equal to the maximum bending stress at any time. This is expressed as
1.5N
a1b1 ≥± a1
2he × ∑Eϕ
where: ∑Eϕ represents the sum, at any time, the products of rotation and modulus of elasticity for
each type of loading.
It was found experimentally that he , the effective height of the throat, can be taken to be 125mm and
hence the above expression may be rewritten as:
∑Eϕ
N
≤1.5 × 2he
a2
1b1 ≈380
a2
1b1
The value of the modulus of elasticity of the hinge for long-term rotations due to shrinkage, creep,
elastic shortening and permanent loads is taken as being half that for temperature and variable loads.
If Ecm = modulus of elasticity for temperature and variable loads (kN/mm2); ϕs = total rotation due to
variable loads and temperature (rads); and, ϕp = total rotation due to shrinkage, creep, elastic
shortening and permanent loads (rads).
Then ∑Eϕ = Ecmϕs + Ecm
2 ϕp
= Ecm
(
ϕs + ϕp
2
)
= Ecmϕe
When the limiting value of zero tension on one side of the throat is reached it follows that the maximum
compressive stress on the other side is 2 × 1.5
N
a1b1 , i.e. three times the average compressive stress
N
a1b1 . Testing showed that under these conditions working values of the average compressive stress
may safely be as much as twice the 28 day cube strength of the concrete or 105 N/mm2, whichever is
the lesser.
B2
Circular hinge
The assessment of circular hinges is based on recommendations by Crossley given in Crossley 1977
[Ref 3.I].
Based on an assumed stress distribution, Crossley determined that for no tension to develop on a
circular throat d1 <
(
3√
1.7Nhe
0.5Eϕ
)
.
Safe load/rotation envelope was derived from the test results on circular hinges.
The graph in Table B.1 gives load/rotation combinations on a chart of
N
fcud2
1 versus ϕe by Crossley in
Crossley 1977 [Ref 3.I].
Table B.1 also provides guidance on the expected performance and condition of the throat in terms of
the acceptable damage to the throat concrete for any applied axial load and corresponding hinge
rotation.
The chart is useful for comparing information obtained during hinge inspections with assessment
calculation results especially where the throat is visible.
On the basis of the test results, areas A, A1, B, and B1 are acceptable for serviceability limit state
assessments.
In areas C, C1 where the mean stress on the throat is less than 2fcu , there is a possibility that damage
of the throat face can be progressive particularly under repeated loading indicating the onset of failure
at serviceability limit state.
