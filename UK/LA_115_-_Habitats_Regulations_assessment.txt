construction, operation and maintenance, of highways and/or roads projects on European sites.
These requirements accord with the relevant national legislation transposing the provisions of
Council Directive 92/43/EEC, on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora
(Habitats Directive), and Council Directive 2009/147/EC, on the conservation of wild birds (Birds
Directive). Habitats Regulations assessment includes Habitats Regulations screening, informing
the appropriate assessment and assessment of alternative solutions, IROPI and compensatory
measures.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
Development of new roads, and improvement and maintenance of existing roads can have 'likely
significant effects' on, or affect the integrity of, 'European sites'. Likely significant effects can result from
the roads project itself (alone) or in combination with other plans or projects.
The development of this document has been specifically influenced by:
1) requirements outlined within the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC [Ref 2.I];
2) requirements outlined within the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC [Ref 2.N];
3) the UK relevant transposing regulations for the implementation of these Directives; and
4) relevant case law.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
It is assumed that practitioners maintain their own up to date knowledge of relevant case-law.

network of sites that enable the natural habitats types and
species' habitats to be maintained or, where appropriate,
restored at a favourable conservation status in their
natural range.
Compensatory measures
Measures that are independent of the project (including
any mitigation measures) intended to offset the negative
effects of the plan or project so that the overall ecological
coherence of the network of European sites is maintained.
Competent authority

European sites
Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC [Ref 2.I] or Birds Directive
2009/147/EC [Ref 2.N], sites including:
1) Special Protection Areas (SPAs), and potential SPAs
(pSPAs);
2) Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and candidate
or possible SACs (cSACs or pSACs); and
3) Ramsar sites.
Evidence plan
A formal mechanism to agree upfront what information
and evidence the applicant needs to supply in the HRA.
Favourable conservation status
For a natural habitat, it occurs when
1) its natural range and areas it covers within that range
are stable or increasing; and
2) the specific structure and functions which are
necessary for its long-term maintenance exist and are
likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future;
and
3) the conservation status of its typical species is
favourable.
For a species, it occurs when
1) the population dynamics data on the species
concerned indicate that it is maintaining itself on a
long-term basis as a viable component of its natural
habitats;
2) the natural range of the species is neither being
reduced nor is likely to be reduced for the foreseeable
future;
3) there is, and will probably continue to be, a sufficiently
large habitat to maintain its populations on a long-term
basis.
Functionally linked land
Areas of land or sea occupied by the qualifying interests
(species) of a European site that lie beyond the boundary
of the site. Such areas support activities such as feeding,
roosting and migration NECR207 [Ref 3.I].
Habitat of a species
An environment defined by specific abiotic and biotic
factors, in which the species lives at any stage of its
biological cycle.
Integrity
The coherence of a site's ecological structure and
function, across its whole area, that enables it to sustain
the habitat, complex of habitats and/or the levels of
populations of the species for which it [is or] was classified
ODPM Circular 06/2005 [Ref 4.N].

Imperative reasons of overriding public
interest
Situations where plans or projects are considered
indispensable:
1) within the framework of actions or policies aiming to
protect fundamental values for citizens' lives (health,
safety, environment);
2) within the framework of fundamental policies for the
State and society;
3) within the framework of carrying out activities of an
economic or social nature, fulfilling specific obligations
of public service.
These are plans or projects which are:
1) both necessary and urgent;
2) of such a scale of importance that the reasons
outweigh the scale of harm to the integrity of the site;
and
3) deliver public good rather than a private interest.
Likely significant effects
Under the Habitat Regulations an effect is likely if:
1) it cannot be excluded, in that it is capable of having an
effect, on the basis of objective information; and
2) it is likely to undermine the site's conservation
objectives.
Mitigation measures
Measures aimed at minimising or even cancelling the
negative impact of a project, during or after its completion.
Natural habitats
Terrestrial or aquatic areas distinguished by geographic,
abiotic and biotic features, whether entirely natural or
semi-natural.
Natural habitat types of community
interest
Natural habitats which, within the territory referred to in
Article 2 92/43/EEC [Ref 2.I]:
1) are in danger of disappearance in their natural range;
or
2) have a small natural range following their regression or
by reason of their intrinsically restricted area; or
3) present outstanding examples of typical characteristics
of one or more of the five following biogeographical
regions: Alpine, Atlantic, Continental, Macaronesian
and Mediterranean.
Objectivity
Sufficient evidence to prove any conclusions beyond any
reasonable scientific doubt.

Principles and purpose
Integration with consent procedures and planning policy
2.1
HRA shall report the effects of a project on:
1) Sites of Community Importance (SCIs);
2) Special Protection Areas (SPAs), and potential/proposed SPAs (pSPAs);
3) Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and candidate (cSAC) or possible/proposed (pSAC) sites;
and
4) Ramsar sites.
2.2
The precautionary principle shall be applied in reporting through all HRA stages.
2.2.1
Recourse to the precautionary principle may be relevant when there:
1) are "potentially negative effects"; or
2) is "insufficiency of the data, which makes it impossible to determine with sufficient certainty the risk
in question".
2.2.2
Site conservation objectives should prevail where there is uncertainty.
2.2.3
Adverse effects should be reported in the HRA in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
2.3
The consequential stages set out in Figure 2.3 shall be followed and the outcomes reported using the
relevant templates in the Appendices to this document.

2. Principles and purpose
2.5
Screening shall report likely significant effects where mitigation of potential effects on the interest
features of a European site are relied upon.
2.5.1
Where the project adopts construction good practice or measures required to avoid nuisance or to
ensure wider legislative compliance these measures should be reported as part of the project
description.
2.6
Where HRA's progress beyond screening, sufficient evidence shall be demonstrated to support all
conclusions beyond reasonable scientific doubt.
Uncertainty

3. Screening
Determination of connection with site management
3.2
The HRA report shall provide evidence of whether the works are connected with or necessary to the
management of a European site.
3.2.1
Such works should include those that are:
1) for conservation purposes;
2) management which is 'directly connected with or necessary' to the site; and
3) solely conceived for the conservation management of a site and not direct or indirect consequences
of other activities.
3.3
Exceptionally when works are concluded to be connected with European site management, the formal
written opinion of the relevant SEB shall be sought on this conclusion.
Examination of the nature of proposed works
3.4
The HRA shall record whether the proposed works are projects in accordance with the 2014/52/EU
[Ref 3.N].
3.5
The description of the project shall include design measures that are considered integral.
3.6
The description of project shall not include mitigation measures that are introduced to avoid harm to the
European site or to avoid likely significant effects (LSE).
Identification of potential effects on European sites
3.7
The screening stage of HRA shall be completed for all European sites where a route corridor or project
meets any of the following screening criteria:
1) is within 2km of a European site or functionally linked land;
2) is within 30km of a SACs, where bats are noted as one of the qualifying interests;
3) crosses or lies adjacent to, upstream of, or downstream of, a watercourse which is designated in
part or wholly as a European site;
4) has a potential hydrological or hydrogeological linkage to a European site containing a groundwater
dependent terrestrial ecosystem (GWDTE) which triggers the assessment of European sites in
accordance with LA 113 [Ref 6.N];
5) has an affected road network (ARN) which triggers the criteria for assessment of European sites LA
105 [Ref 1.N].
3.7.1
For the purposes of HRA, where the established risk to GWDTE is assessed to be above negligible,
further assessment in accordance with LA 113 [Ref 6.N] may be required.
3.7.2
Additional European sites should be subject to screening where the existence of ecological connectivity
between projects and European sites is identified beyond the screening criteria.
Reporting the outcomes of screening
3.8
The screening stage of HRA shall be reported within an HRA report which includes completed
screening matrices for European sites which meet the screening criteria.
3.9
Screening matrices shall support a conclusion that either:
1) there is an absence of LSE; or
2) there are LSE.
3.9.1
Where the screening stage of HRA concludes that there is an absence of European sites which meet
the screening criteria, evidence should be reported in the form of a file note or finding of no significant
effects report.

3. Screening
NOTE
Effect pathways on qualifying interests that are mobile species can extend to land occupied outside of
the designated site boundary.
3.10
Where screening concludes that significant effects are likely (alone or in combination) or that sufficient
uncertainty remains then further HRA shall be undertaken.
Consultation
3.11
Where screening concludes that significant effects are likely (alone or in combination) or that sufficient
uncertainty remains then the opinion of the relevant SEB shall be sought.
3.11.1
Where the relevant SEB(s) disagrees with the reported screening conclusions and this matter cannot
be resolved, then LSE should be assumed.

Appendix C. Outline contents for a statement to inform an...
Present details of those elements of the project which are considered to be mitigation that is plainly
established and uncontroversial (as assumed during screening) or mitigation that has been subject to
further assessment (for elements of project that are considered to have any complexity). Mitigation
should be considered in response to impacts on the European site identified in
Describe mitigation examined in response to impacts on the European site identified in C6.
Briefly describe the alternative solutions considered as part of the EIA.
Present details of how cumulative impacts have been considered.
C6
Potential impacts on protected sites
For each site present information which clearly identified the specific nature of the impacts of the
project on the European Site.
Clearly define the nature of the impacts and described in terms of the following:
1) where the impact directly or indirectly affects the site;
2) loss of Area of European Site;
3) change in species population numbers of qualifying interests;
4) disturbance to species within European Site;
5) effects of fragmentation cased by the project;
6) the reversibility or the impacts;
7) the duration (i.e. long- or short-term).
Describe the sources of information used to make this assessment. This may be from the EIA for the
project or from surveys commissioned specifically to answer questions raised as part of the HRA
process. There should be a statement as to how far professional judgement and the precautionary
principle have been used if there are not fully sufficient professional methodologies to enable the
impacts to be categorically defined. If a qualifying interest is not affected, this should be clearly stated.

Appendix C. Outline contents for a statement to inform an...
Table C.1 Integrity of site checklist
Conservation objectives
Does the project have the potential to:
1) cause delays in progress towards achieving the conservation objectives of the site?;
2) interrupt progress towards achieving the conservation objectives of the site?;
3) disrupt those factors that help to maintain the favourable conditions of the site?;
4) interfere with the balance, distribution and density of key species that are the indicators of the
favourable condition of the site?
Table C.2 Other indicators
Other indicators
Does the project have the potential to:
1) cause changes to the vital defining aspects (e.g. nutrient balance) that determine how the site
functions as a habitat or ecosystem?;
2) change the dynamics of the relationships (between, for example, soil and water or plants and
animals) that define the structure and/or function of the site?;
3) interfere with predicted or expected natural changes to the site (such as water dynamics or
chemical composition)?;
4) reduce the area of key habitats?;
5) reduce the population of key species?;
6) change the balance between key species?;
7) reduce the diversity of the site?;
8) result in disturbance that could affect population size or density of the balance between key
species?;
9) result in fragmentation?;
10) result in loss or reduction of key features (e.g. tree cover, tidal exposure, annual flooding, etc)?
C7
Mitigation
Provide details of the proposals to avoid, reduce and remediate any potential impacts.This should
include sufficient information on the design, construction and monitoring of such measures to allow
their likely success to be determined. Confirmation should be produced to illustrate the applicant's
ability to deliver the mitigation. Evidence of where similar mitigative techniques have been used
previously would also be helpful.

IRZs should be used to support HRA screening and specifically support the assessment of likely
significant effects on the interest features of European sites.
E/1.1.2
Those European sites with IRZs within the project boundary or footprint should be subject to HRA
screening.
NOTE 1
IRZs can be used to identify the areas over which interest features and sensitivities of European sites
extent.
NOTE 2
IRZs can be used to identify the extent of compensatory measures delivered for other projects or plans,
which are not formally included within modifications of the European site boundaries.
E/1.2
Screening outcomes shall for nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs), in addition to the
assumptions within LA 115, be summarised and reported in accordance with the screening matrices
templates in Advice Note 10 [Ref 1.I].
