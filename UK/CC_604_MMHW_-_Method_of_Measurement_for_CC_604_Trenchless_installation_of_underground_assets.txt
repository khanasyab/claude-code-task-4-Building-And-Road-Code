Trenchless crossings - Scope and definitions
Scope
1.1
This method of measurement shall apply to the installation by trenchless techniques of highway drains,
service ducts and culverts of internal diameters 2m or less.
1.2
This method of measurement covers the trenchless or minimum dig installation and the associated
temporary works. All other items of the permanent works shall be measured under CC 500/MMHW
[Ref 7.N].
1.3
For the purposes of this measurement the launch and reception pits shall be considered temporary
works and not measured separately.
Definitions
1.4
The Earthworks Outline is defined in clauses 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 of CC 601/MMHW [Ref
8.N] inclusive and shall apply equally to this method of measurement for trenchless crossings.
1.5
Any reference to chambers shall be deemed to include manholes, catchpits, oil interceptors and
drawpits.
Note
Pipe run is the term used to describe a specific trenchless crossing which has a unique 'Trenchless
crossing identification number'.
