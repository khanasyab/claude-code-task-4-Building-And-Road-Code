Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the walking, cycling and horse-riding assessment and review (WCHAR)
process for highway schemes on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
It defines the applicable highway schemes and stages in the highway scheme development process at
which walking, cycling and horse-riding assessments and reviews are needed, together with the
process requirements.
The purpose of this document is to facilitate the inclusion of all walking, cycling and horse-riding modes
in the highway scheme development process from the earliest stage, enabling opportunities for new or
improved facilities and their integration with the local and national network(s). This could include the
creation and/or improvement of facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians that are separate
from the highway.
WCHAR is intended to provide increased collaboration, interaction and engagement with key
stakeholders.
The WCHAR process is not an independent audit of walking, cycling and horse-riding matters related to
the highway scheme.
The competencies expected of the Lead Assessor responsible for leading this work are set out in
Section 3 of this document.
The process is made up of two distinct parts - the assessment and review.
The aims of carrying out a walking, cycling and horse-riding assessment are:
1) to gain an appropriate understanding of all relevant existing facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and
equestrians (users) in the local area;
2) to provide background user information that can be referred to throughout the development of the
highway scheme;
3) to identify opportunities for improvement for users.
The aims of carrying out a walking, cycling and horse-riding review are:
1) to continually review proposals for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians throughout the
development of the highway scheme design;
2) to review the potential impact of the proposed highway scheme on users in the area and on existing
facilities;
3) to identify new opportunities for improvement (or removal of constraints) for users that may arise
from the development of the highway scheme that were not evident during the assessment phase.
The process concludes prior to the commencement of construction of a highway scheme.
The WCHAR process is summarised in the WCHAR process summary:

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for all highway schemes on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road
network.
1.2
Highway schemes shall be exempt from the requirements of the assessment and the review phases of
the WCHAR process where:
1) they are located entirely within the extents of existing roads for which motorway regulations apply;
2) they are located entirely within the extents of existing roads where pedestrians, cyclists and
equestrians are not permitted;
3) they have no impact on pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians, and where this can be clearly
demonstrated prior to commencing the WCHAR process.
1.3
Where the assessment and review phases are not applied to a highway scheme, as a result of a valid
exemption, the design team leader shall record this decision on an exemption file note to be kept on
record in the project file.
NOTE 1
The design team leader determines the applicability of the WCHAR process on a scheme-by-scheme
basis.
NOTE 2
Appendix A provides an exemption file note template.
1.4
Ex-vehicle pedestrians, such as those using a lay-by or emergency refuge area, shall be exempt from
the WCHAR process as their primary mode of travel to a particular location on the motorway and
all-purpose trunk road network is vehicular.
1.5
The assessment and review phases of the WCHAR process shall apply to the pre-construction
activities associated with a highway scheme.
NOTE
The WCHAR process concludes before the construction phase of a highway scheme and no further
assessment or review applies post-construction.
Developer-led and third party organisation-led highway schemes
1.6
Where developer-led and third party organisation-led highway schemes impact on the motorway and
all-purpose trunk road network, this document shall be applied.
Implementation
1.7
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all highway schemes involving walking, cycling and
horse-riding on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the
implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 1.N].
Use of GG 101

relevance to the highway scheme or crossing points.
4.13.2
The Lead Assessor should be accompanied by any additional assessor(s) that have been appointed.
NOTE
A site visit allows the Lead Assessor and assessor(s) to identify opportunities that can be missed from
online mapping or other sources of desktop data collection and are therefore an important part of the
assessment.
4.13.3
The specific timing of a site visit should be determined by the Lead Assessor.
4.13.4
The specific timing of a site visit should be influenced by the proximity of certain trip generators such as
