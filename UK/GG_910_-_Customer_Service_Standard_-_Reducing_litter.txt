Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives National Highways-specific requirements for reducing litter on
motorways and all purpose trunk roads.
Through our customer service strategy, we aim to deliver better relationships with our customers.
Customer service standards (CSS) are a mechanism to address customer pain points and are a way of
defining what customers can expect and the role National Highways plays in improving customer
satisfaction.
A customer service standard is one which:
1)
draws on customer insight and seeks to address key customer, communities, and stakeholders,
needs and expectations; and
2)
is aligned to the customer service strategy of the Overseeing Organisation.
The purpose of a customer service standard can be either:
1)
to reinforce existing policy/standard (in which case the new standard will signpost the existing
policy rather than duplicate);
2)
to introduce a new standard where one does not currently exist; or,
3)
to seek to identify and address behaviours that are preventing existing policy being followed.
This customer service standard is applicable to asset delivery and where National Highways has
delegated the management and delivery of litter/litter clearance to an external provider.
National Highways roads are the gateways to our towns, cities and major ports and the quality of the
environment is important to customers and key stakeholders. Roads free from litter, refuse and
fly-tipping create a positive impression of the motorway and trunk road network.
Littering is considered socially unacceptable and people are more likely to drop litter if the environment
is already littered.
The motorway and trunk road network can be litter-picked and returned to grade A as defined in the
Litter CoP [Ref 2.N]and within 24 hours litter will begin to accumulate again. Adopting an approach of
continually removing litter from the motorway and trunk road network is uneconomic and increases
risks to road workers undertaking the litter picking activities adjacent to high speed traffic.
National Highways developed and implemented a Litter Strategy [Ref 6.N]which outlines the
overarching goal to reduce the need for litter picking and to deliver an effective litter clearing service.
This strategy is being delivered under four work streams that contribute to the vision of a network
predominantly free from litter without compromising safety and affordability. These are:
1)
influence littering behaviour;
2)
improve operational delivery and asset maintenance;
3)
seek and respond to customer feedback; and,
4)
improve partnership working.
National Highways is not responsible for sweeping and cleaning across all of the motorway and trunk
road network. The Litter Strategy [Ref 6.N]details which roads are the responsibility of National
Highways and which roads are the responsibility of the local authority (LA).
This customer service standard provides details of how the National Highways Litter Strategy [Ref
6.N]should be delivered, whilst complementing existing inspection and maintenance standards by
utilising innovative solutions to reduce littering at source, reduce the exposure of risk to roadworkers,
reduce litter picking frequencies, improve customer satisfaction and ultimately reduce the spend that is
assigned to litter clearance that could be better utilised maintaining other assets.

Introduction
This customer service standard follows the same priority order that is outlined within the Litter Strategy
[Ref 6.N], this being:
1)
reduce the need for litter picking activities by influencing littering behaviours;
2)
utilising intelligence to undertake litter picking activities at the optimum time and/or in conjunction
with other maintenance works to reduce the overall risk to roadworkers;
3)
incorporate customer feedback to tailor future maintenance frequencies or to develop a
behavioural intervention to influence littering behaviours and reduce the need for litter picking;
and,
4)
for roads that National Highways is not responsible for, work with the local authorities to
co-ordinate their litter picking with other maintenance works and/or implement a behavioural
intervention to reduce the need for litter picking.
This standard promotes an outcome-focused, intelligence-led approach to identifying the needs,
implementing a behavioural intervention, and undertaking the cyclic and repair maintenance activities.
This is achieved by using network knowledge, network inspections, asset intelligence, customer insight
and safety risk implications to create bespoke cyclical maintenance frequencies and undertake repair
maintenance activities, when appropriate, based on asset needs. Analysing the intelligence allows for
the development of the right behavioural intervention and ensures cyclic and repair maintenance
activities are undertaken at the optimum time without over specifying maintenance activities and
increasing unnecessary risk to roadworkers.

Definition
Fly-tipping
illegal disposal of waste.
Hot spot
A litter hot spot is an area or location that is particularly challenging to keep free
of litter, refuse or fly-tipping in relation to frequency and volume of littering as
well as the practical aspects to safely collect the litter.
Litter
Litter is most commonly assumed to include materials, often associated with
smoking, eating and drinking, that are improperly discarded and left by
members of the public; or are spilt during business operations as well as waste
management operations.
Refuse
Refuse should be regarded as having its ordinary meaning of waste or rubbish,
including household and commercial waste, and can include fly-tipped waste.
Litter champion
champions any litter-related issues on the motorway and trunk road network.

The EPA ( UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N]) places a statutory duty on National Highways and LAs, so far as
is practicable, to keep public highways clean and clear of litter and refuse.
NOTE 2
The EPA ( UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N])makes a distinction between special roads, which are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State and National Highways manages litter clearance; and trunk
roads, which are the responsibility of the LA. There are some exceptions, e.g. Design Build Finance
Operate (DBFO) roads, where the Secretary of State has retained responsibility by order under Section
86(11) of the EPA ( UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N]). Details of these roads are contained in the Litter
Strategy [Ref 6.N].
NOTE 3
The Litter CoP [Ref 2.N] will assist in delivering the obligations.
E/1.2
The commitments in the DEFRA Litter Strategy (England) [Ref 5.N]shall be delivered.
NOTE
National Highways commitments in the DEFRA Litter Strategy (England) [Ref 5.N]are;
1)
Commitment 25. Identify opportunities for improvement in the cleaning of the motorway and trunk
road network.
2)
Commitment 26. Put in place measures to deliver a lasting improvement in cleanliness at 25
priority hot spots on the motorway and trunk road network.
E/1.3

E/2. Requirements
E/2.
Requirements
Influencing littering behaviour
E/2.1
The objective of this customer service standard shall be to provide methods and processes that assist
in reducing the need for litter-picking the motorway and trunk road network by influencing littering
behaviour.
Intelligence discovery
E/2.2
Intelligence shall be used to identify areas of concern and understand the root cause of littering and
litter hot spots.
NOTE
Examples of intelligence include but are not limited to;
1)
safety patrols, safety inspection and condition inspection, and litter performance indicator data;
2)
understanding the correlation between litter and low speed areas of the network; for example slip
roads and roadworks;
3)
understanding the location of service areas and the associated distribution patterns of litter;
4)
assets vulnerable to the impact of litter; for example gullies in flood risk areas or concrete central
reservation barriers trapping windblown litter; and,
5)
customer complaints, internal and external customer surveys/data, Strategic Road Users Survey
(SRUS) and stakeholder feedback (e.g. Transport Focus).
E/2.3
Intelligence shall be used to monitor trends and the impact of interventions.
Interventions
E/2.4
To keep the motorway and trunk road network free from litter, refuse and fly-tipping, interventions shall
be developed to address the root cause and encourage behavioural change.
NOTE
The National Highways behavioural toolkit has worked examples of behavioural interventions with
detailed guidance on how to implement them. Please e-mail litter@nationalhighways.co.uk for a copy.
Assessment
E/2.5
An assessment shall be undertaken to determine the potential safety risk impact to roadworkers, road
users and other affected parties as defined in GG 104 [Ref 5.I] including costs from implementing a
behavioural change intervention.
Intervention validation
E/2.6
Each intervention shall be measured, monitored and impact evaluated to determine if the intervention
delivered the desired outcomes and if any continual improvements can be incorporated to future
interventions.
NOTE
Interventions such as anti-litter campaigns, targeted poster campaigns, car/HGV height drive up to
bins, mobile variable message signs (VMS), HGV in-cab bins, messages on temporary signs
highlighting the risk to roadworkers have been previously used successfully.
Reporting
E/2.7
The outcomes of any behavioural interventions shall be reported to the Litter Steering Group (LSG).
Enforcement
E/2.8
Where littering from a vehicle is witnessed, the following information shall be recorded and shared with
the relevant LA to be used as evidence to enable them to prosecute:
1)
location;

any enforcement powers.
Campaigns
E/2.9
All litter campaigns relevant to the motorway and trunk road network shall be developed based on
intelligence/ data/research, and the impact evaluated to determine if the campaign delivered the
desired outcomes and if any continual improvements can be incorporated to future campaigns.
Improve operational delivery and asset maintenance
E/2.10
Where accumulations of litter fall below the accepted grade, the motorway and trunk road network must
be brought up to the required grade and within the required response period as defined in the EPA (
UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N]).
E/2.11
The Litter CoP [Ref 2.N] and National Highways maintenance standards define the approach that shall
be utilised to comply with the UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N].
E/2.12
Evidence shall be recorded in accordance with the ADMM [Ref 1.N].
E/2.13
Reducing the need for litter-picking the motorway and trunk road network by influencing littering
behavioural shall be achieved by implementing behavioural change interventions/measures.
E/2.14
Effective operations and maintenance shall focus on litter picking and collection but also on
preventative maintenance to mitigate the effects of litter on other assets.
NOTE
This relates to assets vulnerable to the impact of litter, for example gullies in flood risk areas or
concrete central reservation barriers trapping windblown litter.
Inspection and classification
E/2.15
Litter accumulations shall be classified and recorded as a defect when any part of the motorway and
trunk road network fails to meet the grade defined by the Litter CoP [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
The Litter CoP [Ref 2.N] emphasises the need for a management plan to ensure an area is keep clean.
E/2.16
Litter-related defects as defined by the Litter CoP [Ref 2.N]shall be identified through safety patrols,
safety inspections, condition inspections or through reporting by third parties.
NOTE
For asset delivery areas/regions, a performance indicator (PI) has been introduced during Roads
Period 2. This PI provides an overview of the grading of the motorway and trunk road network in
accordance with the Litter CoP [Ref 2.N]. The PI is calculated using the cleanliness data collected
whilst carrying out network condition inspections, as outlined in GS 801 Asset Delivery Asset
Inspection Requirements (ADAIr) GS 801 [Ref 1.I]. Network condition inspections are usually carried
out on a rolling 12-month basis.
E/2.17
Where the litter grade fails to meet the Litter CoP [Ref 2.N] on roads that the LAs are responsible for,
the relevant LA shall be informed for them to carry out work.
Developing intelligent-led maintenance strategies
E/2.18
Intelligence shall be used to develop cyclical maintenance frequencies ensuring litter picking activities
are undertaken at the optimum frequency without over-specifying maintenance activities and/or
increasing unnecessary risk to road ADMM [Ref 1.N]workers.

Where LAs are responsible for keeping the network free from litter, refuse and fly-tipping, collaboration
with the LA shall be undertaken to facilitate them delivering their statutory duty.
NOTE
The EPA ( UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N]) makes a distinction between special roads, which are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State and National Highways manages litter clearance; and trunk
roads, which are the responsibility of the LA. There are some exceptions, e.g. Design Build Finance
Operate (DBFO) roads, where the Secretary of State has retained responsibility by order under Section
86(11) of the EPA ( UKPGA 1990/43 [Ref 3.N]). Details of these roads are contained in the Litter
Strategy [Ref 6.N].

NOTE 1
The purpose of the tackling litter together collaboration pack is to actively encourage engagement with
LAs, which includes development of an integrated approach.
NOTE 2
The aim of this collaboration is to work with the local authorities and co-ordinate their litter picking
activities with other maintenance works to reduce customer disruption and road worker exposure,
and/or implement a behavioural intervention to reduce the need for litter picking.
E/2.35.1
A memorandum of understanding or working arrangements should be agreed with the LA that
documents the approach to be taken in working together towards the common objective of making the
network free from litter, refuse and fly-tipping.
NOTE 1
This approach includes sharing best practice and gathering information that can be used as evidence
to address anti-social behaviour (for example, littering from vehicles).
NOTE 2
Under S.5 of the Highways Act ( UKPGA 1980/66 [Ref 4.I]) there is a general duty to co-operate, in so
far as reasonably practicable, with other persons exercising functions which relate to highways.
E/2.36
Where the motorway and trunk road network adjoins other highway authority roads, National Highways
shall consult together with the relevant LA to develop an integrated approach and identify opportunities
to improve how litter, refuse and fly-tipping is reduced.
