Introduction
Introduction
Background
In order to use public funds more effectively, future highways schemes need to make better use of
existing roads and associated infrastructure. The widening of highways is an efficient means of
achieving this.
Widening gives rise to many issues affecting existing structures. The treatment of these issues can
have a major influence on the design and cost of a widening scheme.
This document updates and replaces BD 95/07, containing the requirements and advice for the
treatment of structures on highway widening schemes on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads, and
setting out the principles to be applied in the process.
A consistent approach is promoted to improve efficiency and avoid unnecessary design and
construction work, with the overall aim of achieving better value for money on widening schemes.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 4.N].

CD 367 Revision 0
2. Principles to be adopted in the development o...
2.
Principles to be adopted in the development of the widening
scheme
Structure-highway interface
2.1
The loading and geometric criteria for the scheme shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation
prior to the preparation of the structure options reports (SORs).
2.1.1
Each structure should be reviewed individually to determine if the desired cross-section can be
achieved, taking account of geometric constraints, accident statistics etc.
2.1.2
The benefits of a consistent highway cross-section should be balanced against the cost benefits
associated with local variations driven by specific structural and/or site constraints.
Treatment of existing non-compliance
2.2
Any structures-related non-compliance with a DMRB assessment or maintenance requirement shall be
addressed as part of the scheme.
NOTE
Maintenance requirements are specific DMRB requirements for a performance feature to be
maintained during the service life of a structure, e.g. CD 127 [Ref 1.I].
2.3
Any known structures-related non-compliance with a DMRB design requirement shall be addressed as
part of the scheme if any of the following criteria apply:
1) retaining a non-compliance represents a significant safety risk;
2) the risks associated with the non-compliance are exacerbated by the widening scheme;
3) there is a national policy to upgrade particular elements during major schemes or DMRB design
documents include a relevant requirement to be implemented on improvement schemes;
4) based on an assessment of whole life costs, there is a clear case for upgrading, maintenance or
even replacement to be carried out as part of the widening scheme;
5) upgrading works at the structure to address the non-compliance are required to be carried out in the
short term.
2.3.1
A non-compliance may be addressed by:
1) undertaking works to eliminate the non-compliance or;
2) obtaining approval from the Overseeing Organisation to retain the non-compliance through the
departures approval system.
NOTE
A widening scheme often presents an opportunity to carry out maintenance, upgrading or strengthening
works in a cost effective manner and with minimal further disruption to the road network.
2.4
When reviewing existing non-compliances, agreement shall be sought from the Overseeing
Organisation regarding:
1) the scope of works;
2) acceptable non-compliance(s);
3) the responsibility for design and construction;
4) the funding for the work.
2.4.1
The scope, responsibility and funding of works should be agreed at preliminary design stage with the
Overseeing Organisation.
2.4.2
Irrespective of whether non-compliances were known about in advance, the principles that should be
applied to dealing with them remain the same.
NOTE
Additional non-compliances can become apparent from inspections and/or assessments undertaken as
part of the scheme.

CD 367 Revision 0
2. Principles to be adopted in the development o...
Retention of non-compliances
2.5
Any proposed retention of non-compliance with a DMRB assessment or maintenance requirement shall
require a departure from standards.
2.5.1
A non-compliance with DMRB design requirements should not require a departure from standards
provided that none of the criteria in 2.3 are applicable.
2.6
Details of the retained non-compliances shall be included in a list of latent departures for each
individual structure.
NOTE
No departure from standards is necessary in relation to the assessed capacity of a structure for special
types general order and special order vehicles.
2.7
A departure from standards submission shall be required for non-compliance with the following,
regardless of whether the structure is unaffected or requires works to accommodate the scheme:
1) DMRB assessment requirement;
2) DMRB maintenance requirement.
2.7.1
In the case of missing assessment documentation, one of the following options should be implemented:
1) a reassessment is carried out;
2) justification for retaining the structure in use is provided to the Overseeing Organisation.
2.8
A departure from standards submission shall be required for non-compliance with DMRB design
requirements, whether the structure is unaffected or requires works to accommodate the scheme,
where any of the criteria in 2.3 are applicable.
2.8.1
Non-compliance with DMRB design requirements in unaffected structures may be accepted with no
further approval action, where none of the criteria in 2.3 are applicable.
2.9
Where the structure requires works to accommodate the scheme and none of the criteria in 2.3 are
applicable, non-compliance with DMRB design requirements shall be included in the list of latent
departures and submitted to the Overseeing Organisation for review.
2.10
Where a departure from standards has previously been approved for a specific issue, a further
departure from standards submission for that issue shall only be required where any of the criteria in
2.3 are applicable.
NOTE
For example, where the risks at the time the previous departure from standards was approved are
increased as a consequence of the scheme.
Replication of a structures related non-compliance
2.11
A formal departure from standards submission shall be required in every case of replicating an existing
non-compliance in the process of extending or modifying an existing structure.
NOTE 1
This requirement applies whether the extension or modification works are necessary to accommodate
the widening scheme, such as deck widening; or the works are not directly related to the widening,
such as deck strengthening.
NOTE 2
Replicating existing non-compliances can be justified in some circumstances, for example providing
new joints to match the existing over intermediate supports.
Modifying, strengthening or upgrading an existing structure
2.12
Where a structure is to be modified or a non-compliance is to be addressed, then the modification,
strengthening or upgrading shall be designed in accordance with DMRB design requirements.
2.13
The existing elements of a modified, strengthened or upgraded structure shall comply with DMRB
assessment requirements.

2.13.1
The whole structure of a modified bridge should be certified, unless partial certification has been
agreed with the Overseeing Organisation, e.g. in the case of isolated strengthening or upgrade works.
NOTE 1
Where different requirements are applied to the new and existing parts of a bridge, there is potential for
it to have varying capacity.
NOTE 2
In some cases the capacity of the whole bridge is limited by the existing elements. In other cases,
heavier loads could be permitted but restricted to particular lanes.
2.13.2
Where different parts of a bridge have different capacities, any need to restrict heavier loads to
particular lanes should be identified in the assessment report and certificate.
Future inspection and maintenance
2.14
Future maintenance and inspection shall be addressed in the development of the proposals.
2.15
The means of facilitating future maintenance and inspection shall be recorded in the SORs, and later in
the structure review process documents.
Aesthetics and heritage issues
2.16
The aesthetics of modified structures shall be designed in keeping with the existing infrastructure and
surrounding environment.
NOTE
Guidance on aesthetics of modified structures is provided in CD 351 [Ref 2.I].
2.17
Any heritage issues associated with the existing structures shall be addressed in accordance with CG
304 [Ref 3.N].
Redundant structures
2.18
All abandoned or redundant existing structures within the new highway boundary shall be demolished,
partially demolished, concrete filled or otherwise made safe in order to remove any maintenance
liability and to eliminate any effect on the performance of the network, unless otherwise agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation.

Clarifying requirements for assessment of existing structures
Structures to be assessed
3.1
Unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation, structures shall be assessed where there
is:
1) no existing assessment or design valid for the proposed treatment of the structure;
2) a change in the design load of the structure;
3) a change in the condition of the structure;
4) a change in legislation or the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation; or,
5) a proposed modification of the structure.
3.2
Structures which are being modified in a way which affects their structural behaviour shall require
assessment.
3.3
Any project-specific requirements or principles to be adopted regarding assessment of structures,
including any requirement to assess for special order vehicle loading, shall be agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation.
Assessment validity
3.4
The validity of an existing assessment (or design) for the proposed condition shall be determined
through the completion of a record of structural review form (RSRF) as set out in CD 350 [Ref 9.N].
3.5
Reasoning as to why the structure is deemed acceptable without further assessment shall be recorded
in the RSRF.
NOTE
It is not necessary to verify the accuracy of the existing assessment.
Assessments standards
3.6
Existing structures or existing elements of modified structures shall be assessed to DMRB assessment
requirements.
NOTE
Where an existing element complies with DMRB design requirements a check to DMRB assessment
requirements is not necessary.
Achieving minimum required capacity
3.7
Where a structure is found not to be capable of carrying the proposed loading, one of the following
options shall be undertaken, with the agreement of the Overseeing Organisation:
1) carry out further assessment (such as more accurate field measurements, materials testing or more
detailed analysis techniques), ref CS 454 [Ref 2.N] for levels of assessment;
2) obtain a departure from standards;
3) carry out strengthening or replacement.
3.7.1
Other options to address a failed assessment may be acceptable with the agreement of the Overseeing
Organisation.
Assessment for substructure impact and parapet impact
3.8
Where the proposed works increase the likelihood or consequences of vehicle/substructure impact,
then unless a valid assessment for substructure impact already exists, this particular assessment shall
be carried out.
NOTE
An example of a situation which can increase the likelihood or consequences of vehicle/substructure
impact is where closer proximity between traffic and the existing piers is proposed as part of the
widening scheme.

3.9
Where the substructure fails an assessment in accordance with CS 453 [Ref 8.N] the non-compliance
shall be addressed as part of the scheme.
3.9.1
The non-compliance may be addressed by undertaking strengthening/protection works or by obtaining
approval from the Overseeing Organisation to retain the non-compliance.
3.10
Vehicle restraint system provision on a widening scheme shall be determined in accordance with CD
377 [Ref 5.N].
3.11
The decision on whether to upgrade or replace parapets shall be determined by undertaking an
assessment in accordance with CS 461 [Ref 1.N].
3.12
Where a new vehicle restraint system is being installed, an assessment shall be required to verify that
the load effects acting on the structure can be accommodated.
NOTE
No further assessment is required if an existing assessment is valid for the load effects associated with
a new parapet.
Assessment criteria
3.13
Unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation, the structural assessment of existing
structures shall be carried out in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 2.N].
3.14
For schemes involving partial assessment, assessment certification shall identify the elements covered
and record the extent to which the previous design or assessment remains valid.

The process for dealing with existing structures
4.1
The process for dealing with existing structures, including any special requirements, specific actions or
amendments to the design/assessment process at any stage, shall be agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation prior to the commencement of the associated work.
NOTE
The process for dealing with existing structures can be dependent on the contract form and scheme
specifics.
4.1.1
The process for dealing with existing structures should involve (subject to the agreement of the
Overseeing Organisation):
1) agreement of the scope of the widening scheme and identification of the preferred highway
cross-section;
2) a full search for data relating to all of the structures on the widening scheme;
3) a review of this data to identify any missing data or discrepancies, including the updating of the
asset database or equivalent if inaccuracies or supplementary information is found;
4) consultation with the Overseeing Organisation to obtain missing data and address any
discrepancies; as well as to agree any structural renewals, inspection or assessment work to be
carried out as part of the scheme;
5) conducting any further inspection or assessment work agreed with the Overseeing Organisation
where necessary to de-risk the scheme at an early stage;
6) the preparation of SORs for all modified, strengthened, upgraded or otherwise affected structures,
and a schedule of any unaffected structures within the scheme, including the assumptions made in
their classification as such;
7) the detailed design of the geometric widening proposals for the scheme;
8) the detailed design of the strengthened, upgraded, or modified structures, following approval of the
preliminary design proposals by the Overseeing Organisation.
4.1.2
The flow chart below illustrates the typical process that should be followed for existing structures.

NOTE
Reductions in required highway cross-sections across an existing structure, with the agreement of the
Overseeing Organisation, can provide a means of accommodating the widened highway without
demolition/reconstruction or modification of the existing structure.
4.1.3
The technical process for the assessment/design of a modified structure may be simplified with the
agreement of the Overseeing Organisation, depending on the type of structure and the modification
proposed.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Transport Scotland specific requirements for treatment of
existing structures on highway widening schemes. In order to use public funds more effectively, future
highways schemes need to make better use of existing roads and associated infrastructure. The
widening of highways is an efficient means of achieving this.
Widening gives rise to many issues affecting existing structures. The treatment of these issues can
have a major influence on the design and cost of the widening scheme. Valuable experience has been
gained from a number of previous schemes, but this has not been recorded centrally and is not readily
available to others in the form of advice.
A consistent approach is promoted to improve efficiency and avoid unnecessary design and
construction work, with the overall aim of achieving better value for money on widening schemes.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
