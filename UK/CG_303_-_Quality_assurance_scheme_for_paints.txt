2. Paint quality assurance scheme
2.
Paint quality assurance scheme
2.1
Any paint used for the protection of steelwork in highway structures against corrosion shall be in
accordance with the paint quality assurance scheme as defined in this Section, comprising:
1)
certification; and
2)
contract compliance testing of 'A' samples as specified in CC 487 [Ref 4.N]or CC 486 [Ref 14.N].
NOTE 1
The paints are used in various protective systems, the details of which are given in CC 486 [Ref 14.N]
for new works and CM 431 [Ref 3.N]for maintenance works.
NOTE 2
The protective systems for new works are specified through CC 486 [Ref 14.N], with design outputs
provided in accordance with CD 350 [Ref 17.N]Appendix E.
NOTE 3
The protective systems for maintenance works are specified through CC 487 [Ref 4.N], with design
outputs provided in accordance with CM 431 [Ref 3.N].
Certification
2.2
Any paint supplied for the protection of steelwork in highway structures against corrosion shall have a
certificate confirming compliance with a product acceptance scheme that meets the requirements for
product acceptance schemes in GC 101 [Ref 1.N] and the characteristics described in BBA Guidelines
No 12 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 1
BBA Guidelines No 12 [Ref 1.I] describes the requirements for obtaining BBA HAPAS certification of
paint products.
NOTE 2
The certification of paint materials includes the review of paint manufacturers' formulations and the
assessment of the performance of paint samples by the certification body to ensure they comply with
the performance requirements stated in the BBA HAPAS document BBA Guidelines No 12 [Ref 1.I].
2.3
The certificate shall confirm compliance of the paint to an Item Number from the Manual of Paints for
Structural Steelwork in Appendix A, except paints supplied for HM IV Maintenance 1 or 2 Coat Short
Possession System, as defined in CM 431 [Ref 3.N].
2.4
Any paint supplied for HM IV Maintenance 1 or 2 Coat Short Possession System, as defined in CM 431
[Ref 3.N], shall have a current Network Rail PADS registered certificate, confirming the paint meets the
testing requirements of NR/L2/CIV/039 [Ref 15.N] and complies with NR/L3/CIV/040 [Ref 18.N].
NOTE
Some paints defined in NR/L3/CIV/040 [Ref 18.N] have a similar definition and formulation to National
Highways products, but they are not interchangeable. Only the paints specified for HM IV Maintenance
1 or 2 Coat Short Possession System are permitted, and only for use in that system.
2.5
All paints supplied for the works must be labelled in accordance with The Chemicals (Hazard
Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009, UKSI 2009/716 [Ref 16.N].
2.6
The requirements for 'Product acceptance schemes' in Section 12 of GC 101 [Ref 1.N] shall apply to
paint used for protection of steelwork against corrosion.
Contract compliance testing
2.7
'A' samples, when tested in accordance with Testing of 'A' and 'B' paint samples in Section 3 of this
document, shall have properties consistent with the registered values.

Appendix A. Manual of paints for structural steelwork
A1
Description of the manual of paints for structural steelwork
A1.1
Item sheets
The manual of paints for structural steelwork provides details for paints in the item sheets. Each item
sheet gives the item number and:
1)
a description of the paint;
2)
its colour;
3)
its use;
4)
its dry film thickness range;
5)
its build and method of application;
6)
an outline composition.
The item sheets do not provide information on the selection of suitable paint systems for new
construction or the maintenance of existing structures.
A1.2
Standard terminology
Paints are described in the manual of paints for structural steelwork using standard terminology to
enable paints to be described in generic terms and without specifying trade names.
The standard terminology is used for the registered description in paint item sheets and in CC 486 [Ref
14.N] and CM 431 [Ref 3.N], and may be used in paint data sheets to convey the following information:
1)
name of pigment e.g. micaceous iron oxide (MIO), zinc phosphate;
2)
description of the type of medium e.g. polyurethane, polysiloxane, epoxy;
3)
application of the paint item e.g. blast primer, primer, undercoat or finish;
4)
type of finish e.g. sheen, gloss;
5)
description of use, where the paint item is suited to a specific use, e.g. maintenance, internal,
adhesion promoter;
6)
number of components that make up the material e.g. 'single component', 'two pack'; and
7)
other descriptions to reflect specific properties, e.g. moisture cured, extended cure, high build.
NOTE 1: Where pigments provide colour, opacity or act as extenders etc. the pigments are not named.
NOTE 2: For 'application of the paint item', the first coat only in a paint system is described as a blast
primer or primer; all subsequent intermediate coats are described as undercoats, the last coat being
the finish.
