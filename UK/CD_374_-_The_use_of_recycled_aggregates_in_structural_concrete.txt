Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives requirements and advice for the use of recycled aggregates in structural concrete
for highways structures, providing key information that is required to design structural concrete
containing recycled aggregates and manage the risks in their adoption.
Recycled aggregates, as opposed to natural and manufactured aggregates that are of mineral origin,
result from the processing of inorganic material previously used in construction and can be made of
different constituents, defined in BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N] as:
1)
Rc (concrete, concrete products, mortar, concrete masonry units);
2)
Ru (unbound aggregate, natural stone, hydraulically bound aggregate);
3)
Rb (clay masonry units such as bricks and tiles, calcium silicate masonry units, aerated
non-floating concrete);
4)
Ra (bituminous material);
5)
FL (floating material in volume);
6)
Rg (glass);
7)
X (other - cohesive clay or soil, ferrous or non ferrous metals, non-floating wood, plastic, rubber,
gypsum plaster).
Aggregates for concrete, including recycled aggregates, are covered in BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N] which
gives, as one of the essential characteristics, the composition of coarse recycled aggregates in terms of
categories of content for each constituent.
This document clarifies that the performance requirements for recycled aggregates to be used for
highway structures, including their composition, are those given in BS 8500-1 [Ref 4.N] and BS 8500-2
[Ref 5.N].
This document sets out the considerations a designer should take into account for using recycled
aggregates in highways structures. It also sets out the limitations on where these should be used and
describes the effects on concrete properties.
The document is also intended to summarise the provisions of the standards and documents relevant
to the use of recycled aggregates in the UK. Since the publication of the previous edition, a number of
those have been published or updated, updated, allowing the streamlining of the requirements and
advice, and refer, where appropriate, directly to those.
Relevant standards and documents include BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N] and the associated PD 6682-1 [Ref
2.N], BS EN 206 [Ref 3.N] and the complementary British Standards BS 8500-1 [Ref 4.N] and BS
8500-2 [Ref 5.N], and CC 482 [Ref 1.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 8.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard", or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with GG 101 [Ref 8.N].

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements set out in this document shall be adopted for the use of recycled aggregates in
structural concrete for highway structures.
NOTE 1
The use of recycled aggregates in structural concrete is encouraged, as it can provide benefits
associated with sustainable development, related to prudent use of natural resources and maximising
use of recycling of construction waste, and potential for cost savings; however, while their use is well
established for low grade applications such as subbase in road construction, use in structural concrete
applications has been limited.
NOTE 2
An inherit characteristic of recycled aggregates is that they have a higher water demand than
aggregates of mineral origin, which could lead to reductions in strength and durability performance of
the hardened concrete. For this reason, they are generally used only in combination with natural and
manufactured aggregates within a concrete mix.
NOTE 3
Until a track record of successful use of recycled aggregates in structural concrete is established, their
use is restricted to structural elements subject to less onerous exposure classes and with inherent
robustness.
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the use of recycled aggregates
on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the
implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 8.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 8.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

Recycled aggregate
Supply
2.1
Recycled aggregates for use in structural concrete shall be specified to conform to BS EN 12620 [Ref
1.N].
NOTE
PD 6682-1 [Ref 2.N] gives guidance on the use of BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N] and recommends the limiting
values of aggregate properties for use in the UK within the permitted range.
2.2
When coarse recycled aggregates are used, the performance requirements of the aggregates in
relation to the essential characteristics in BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N], including the composition in terms of
categories of content of constituents of recycled aggregates, shall be as those given in BS 8500-2 [Ref
5.N] for coarse crushed concrete aggregates (CCA).
NOTE 1
Definitions and distinction between coarse and fine aggregates are given in BS EN 12620 [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 2
The performance requirements given in BS 8500-2 [Ref 5.N] for coarse CCA in terms of category of
content of constituents ensure that the coarse recycled aggregates are adequate for use in structural
concrete.
NOTE 3
The use of fine recycled aggregates in structural concrete applications is not recommended, as there
are challenges in establishing their suitability, as clarified in BS 8500-1 [Ref 4.N] and BS 8500-2 [Ref
5.N].

Structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates
Design
3.1
Design of structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates, undertaken to BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref
7.N] and BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 6.N], shall take into account the changes in properties of fresh and
hardened concrete resulting from the presence of recycled aggregates in the concrete mix.
NOTE
Mix design of concrete incorporating recycled aggregates is a specialist skill to be undertaken by
personnel with the appropriate knowledge and experience.
3.1.1
The magnitude and significance of changes in the properties of concrete, due to the use of recycled
aggregates, which could affect the design of the structural concrete element should be assessed.
NOTE 1
Incorporating recycled aggregates into concrete can have an effect on the concrete properties, and as
the amount of recycled aggregates increases the changes become more pronounced. This can lead to
changes in physical properties of the concrete and potential effects on durability.
NOTE 2
Guidance on properties of recycled aggregates and their effect on structural concrete is provided in
Appendix A.
3.1.2
For non-prestressed concrete, where the proposed percentage of recycled aggregates exceeds 30% of
the total aggregates by mass in the concrete mix, the modulus of elasticity of the concrete should be a
measured value from trial concrete mixes and not values based on cube strength (as is often used for
normal concrete), as the relationship between cube strength and modulus can be different.
NOTE
BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref 7.N] clarifies that the modulus of elasticity of a concrete is controlled by the
modulus of elasticity of its components, which is largely dictated by the aggregates.
3.1.3
For prestressed concrete, the modulus of elasticity should be measured from trial concrete mixes in all
cases.
3.1.4
BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref 7.N] gives guidance on shrinkage and creep for normal concrete and this may
need to be adjusted to suit the properties of the concrete mix incorporating recycled aggregates on the
basis of the results from trial concrete mixes.
Limitations to use
3.2
The percentage of recycled aggregates to the total aggregates by mass in the concrete mix shall not
exceed:
1)
60% for non-prestressed concrete structures; nor,
2)
20% for prestressed concrete structures.
NOTE 1
The effect on concrete properties when high percentages of recycled aggregates are used can be
considerable and it is not considered appropriate at this stage for this percentage to exceed 60%.
NOTE 2
The 20% limit on percentage of recycled aggregates to the total aggregates by mass in the concrete
mix for use in prestressed concrete is in relation to the increasingly higher effects on drying shrinkage
and potential effects on creep on concrete incorporating recycled aggregates beyond that level, which
are considered to give too high an unknown for the long-term properties of prestressed concrete.
3.2.1
When the proposed percentage of recycled aggregates to the total aggregates by mass in the concrete
mix in non-prestressed concrete structures is in excess of 30%, and in all cases for prestressed
concrete structures, trial mixes should be specified at an early stage on the proposed resulting concrete
to verify the properties to be used in design, to be subsequently agreed as part of the technical
approval process to CG 300 [Ref 9.N].
3.2.2
For buried structures and structures with no access for inspection, the percentage of recycled
aggregates to the total aggregates by mass in the concrete mix should not be in excess of 30%.
NOTE 1
A percentage of recycled aggregates of up to 30% of the total aggregate by mass in structural concrete
is recommended as the limit in BS EN 206 [Ref 3.N] for typical exposure classes; up to this level the

impact on the design properties for non-prestressed concrete is considered minimal and no additional
measures need to be undertaken..
NOTE 2
Guidance on the properties of structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates that could affect
the design considerations is given in Appendix A.
3.3
Structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates shall not be used for structures in exposure
classes other than X0, XC1, XC2, XC3, XC4, XF1, XD1 and DC-1.
NOTE
The exposure classes for structural concrete for use in the UK are defined in BS 8500-1 [Ref 4.N].
3.4
Structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates shall only be used for strength classes up to
C40/50 as per the recommendations in BS 8500-2 [Ref 5.N], unless the recycled aggregates is
obtained by crushing hardened concrete of known composition that has not been in use, e.g. surplus
precast units or returned fresh concrete, and not contaminated by storage or processing.

Appendix A. Properties of recycled aggregate and its effect on structural
concrete
A1
Properties of recycled aggregate
Particles of recycled aggregate generally comprises crushed stone aggregate partially coated with
mortar or cement paste. The amount of surrounding mortar will vary depending on the method by
which the recycled aggregate was produced; for example, an increasing number of cycles in a ball
crusher can reduce the amount of mortar present. However there are other more efficient processing
methods available, but the aim should still be to remove as much of the mortar as possible. The mortar,
which is lighter and more porous than aggregates used in standard concrete mixes, affects the physical
properties of the recycled material notably with respect to water absorption and density. This has
implications for concrete mix design and concrete properties such as elastic modulus, shrinkage, creep
and permeability. Moreover, the increased alkali content resulting from the mortar, and the presence of
unknown aggregate types in the parent concrete of the recycled aggregate might increase the risk of
internal degradation of concrete (IDC). The parent concrete could also have additional contaminants
such as high chloride levels, carbonated material or IDC reaction products. In fact such features might
be the reason for the concrete to have been recycled in the first place.
A2
Internal degradation of concrete (IDC)
IDC needs greater consideration where recycled aggregates are used. The mortar surrounding the
aggregate particles will increase alkali levels and there is the possibility that the source concrete for the
recycled aggregate included reactive aggregates, although the risk of expansion would be reduced
because of the higher porosity of recycled aggregate. If the specification for the original source
concrete is known then the aggregate reactivity could be assessed but this will not always be the case.
There is also the possibility that partial replacement with recycled aggregate could result in pessimum
proportions – the concentration of reactive aggregates where the reaction is maximised. If it is known
that active IDC or significant quantities of IDC were present in a source structure this would preclude its
use as a source of recycled aggregate. Moreover, if there is any reason to believe that there might be
reactive aggregates in the recycled aggregate, a petrographical examination can be carried out or the
recycled aggregate classed as high reactivity for the purpose of checking the susceptibility of the
resulting concrete to ASR.
A3
Properties of structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates
A3.1
Physical properties
The impact of the following on physical properties on the concrete should be accounted for in the
development of a mix design for structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates, which are areas
where there are likely to be differences compared with similar strength concretes made with traditional
aggregates:
1)
water demand (in the fresh state) increases with increase in recycled aggregate content, where
the degree of demand increases as the proportion of recycled aggregate increases;
2)
density is reduced, where the degree of reduction increases as the proportion of recycled
aggregate increases;
3)
modulus of elasticity is reduced, where the degree of reduction increases as the proportion of
recycled aggregate increases;
4)
shrinkage is increased, where increasing levels of recycled aggregate lead to increased
shrinkage and potential problems with creep, especially relevant for prestressed concrete;
5)
permeability is increased, which could result in more rapid ingress of contaminants;
6)
potential impacts on other concrete properties include coefficient of thermal expansion, tensile
strength, and bond strength; and
7)
the cement content of the mix containing the recycled aggregate and its effect on various
properties of concrete.

======================================================================
CD 374 Version 0.0.1
Appendix A. Properties of recycled aggregate and its eff...
As the information available on the degree of such effects is not extensive, it is prudent to adopt a
conservative approach to the use of recycled aggregate in structural concrete, which results in its use
not being recommended for high percentage of replacement, especially in more sensitive cases such
as prestressed concrete, concrete structures difficult to inspect and high strength concrete applications
with higher degrees of doubt about the condition of the source concrete of the recycled aggregates.
A3.2
Effects on durability
The impact of the following on durability of the concrete should be accounted for in the development of
a mix design for structural concrete incorporating recycled aggregates, which are areas where there
are likely to be differences compared with similar strength concretes made with traditional aggregates:
1)
there are no indications that freeze-thaw resistance and resistance to carbonation are particularly
different, provided that properly quality controlled recycled aggregate has been used;
2)
the increased permeability of concrete incorporating recycled aggregate can increase the rate of
chloride ingress and may lead to higher corrosion rates; however the increased alkali content of
recycled aggregate could assist in raising the chloride threshold level which triggers corrosion,
and the use of blended cements with higher proportions of additions such as GGBS or fly ash
may greatly mitigate the effects;
3)
sulfate attack can result in expansive disruption of concrete. In some cases sulfate contamination
could be present in recycled aggregate (e.g. from plaster), and this should be taken into account
in choosing source material for the recycled aggregate. There are no indications that resistance
to external sources of sulfate would be dissimilar to traditional aggregate concrete; and
4)
alkali silica reaction and, more generally IDC, needs greater consideration, as described in
section A2 of this Appendix.
