Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the process for the appraisal of the deployment of renewable energy systems
(RES) on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads. It specifically addresses the high-level approach for
RES requirements as well as the competencies of those involved in this area of the service.
The primary purpose of introducing RES on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network is to
reduce carbon emissions through a greater proportion of energy to be provided from renewable
sources. Consequently a key consideration is the potential carbon saving, which can be used in order
to provide economic justification for the introduction of renewable energy systems.
Other considerations where RES provides benefits, such as economic value in remote locations not in
the proximity of existing DSO electrical networks, can also be quantifiable and therefore can be
recorded and taken into account.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N]apply to this document.
This document is written for the competent electrical roadside technology professional/practitioner,
electrical engineer and road safety engineer with experience in the appraisal of renewable energy
schemes for all electrical roadside assets in order that a renewable energy appraisal is undertaken that
is suitable for motorway and all-purpose trunk roads.
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a 'British Standard' or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 3.N].

Concept overview
Location of equipment and safety
3.1
The potential location of any RES shall be determined by the operational requirements of the
equipment requiring an electrical supply.
NOTE
Once this location is determined then the feasibility of deploying a RES can be appraised.
3.2
When locating a RES the choice of system and locations shall be assessed to minimise the risk of
vandalism and theft.
3.3
Any RES shall be located at a setback from the carriageway as to minimise any risk to all affected
populations.
3.4
An assessment in accordance with CD 377 [Ref 4.N] shall be included within the findings report.
3.5
The location of a RES shall assess the likelihood of coming in close proximity with all affected
populations.
3.5.1
Where a fence or barrier is required, the cost of this should be included within the economic appraisal.
3.6
Any proposed RES locations shall provide a safe working environment for persons interfacing with the
installation.
Availability of supply
3.7
The availability of a DSO electrical connection (exit point) shall only be determined through liaison with
the DSO and with reference to TG 411 [Ref 2.N].
3.8
Where a DSO-derived supply (exit point) does not currently exist or is not viable, after liaison with the
DSO, then a RES shall be appraised as an alternative source of energy.
3.9
Where a DSO-derived supply (exit point) already exists/is viable, the RES shall be appraised either as
an alternative source or as a hybrid supply source. This applies to existing electrical connections both
to be retained and those requiring an upgrade by the DSO.
3.10
Where a hybrid supply is proposed this shall be documented within the findings report and presented to
the Overseeing Organisation with supporting information and evidence of the liaison that has taken
place.
NOTE
Hybrid supplies require liaison with the Overseeing Organisation and the DSO in order to be permitted.
3.10.1
The existing metering arrangement and electrical supply terms and conditions should be ascertained to
inform the appraisal report.
Reliability of supply
3.11
The supply configuration shall be reliable for the nature of the equipment supplied.
3.11.1
The energy demands of the equipment should be met through either:
1)
the use of a RES capable of providing reliable energy,
2)
the use of a RES and a suitable energy storage system,
3)
the use of a RES and a DSO-derived supply, or
4)
the combination of RES, a suitable energy storage system and a DSO-derived supply.
3.12
Where the nature of the equipment supplied warrants a reliability of supply, unless it can be
demonstrated that a RES can supply this load profile requirement independently, either through
generation and/or the provision of an energy storage system, then a DSO-derived supply shall also be
required.
3.13
The energy storage system shall be suitable for the environment in which it is proposed.

TA 401 Version 1.0.0
3. Concept overview
NOTE
For example, street lighting typically operates at night therefore the load requirement can be inversely
proportional to the generation profile of a PV-based RES due to the availability of daytime solar
insolation, where as VSS can be operational at all times.
3.14
Where the load profile exceeds the calculated potential energy generation profile (including any
contribution from an energy storage system) and reliability of supply is required, then a DSO supply
shall also be required.
3.15
The system autonomy of installation supplied from a RES shall be calculated and presented to the
Overseeing Organisation.
Standardised equipment
3.16
Industry standard and non-proprietary commercially available off-the-shelf renewable energy
components and systems shall be assessed.
NOTE 1
The standardisation of equipment ensures less diversity of devices, reduced maintenance stock and
improved operative familiarity with the equipment on site. This requires far less effort to get to know the
devices and reduces the complexity of keeping the plant operating.
NOTE 2
New innovative systems can be considered for trials off the motorway and all-purpose trunk road
networks to determine their viability.
3.17
Evidence showing proposed equipment complies with the DSO connection requirements shall be
included with the appraisal findings report.
Non-quantifiable requirements
3.18
The RES installation and appearance shall be sympathetic to the environment in which it is located.
NOTE 1
For example, potential glint and glare from the solar PV panels, shadow flicker and acoustic noise from
wind turbines can impact the surrounding environment.
NOTE 2
Installation appearance can be influenced by the choice of equipment and mounting heights.
3.19
In instances where specific protected or designated fauna or flora are present, national guidance shall
be followed to mitigate any adverse effects.
3.20
In locations of historical and cultural significance, specific mitigation shall be required and subject to the
agreement of the Overseeing Organisation.

Economic appraisal
Benefit-cost analysis
4.1
A benefit-cost analysis shall be undertaken reviewing all gains (benefits) and losses (costs) to show the
potential rewards expected from a RES compared with a solely DSO-derived supply. This includes
capital costs, operating costs, decommissioning costs and carbon savings over the expected operating
life of the system.
4.2
A RES shall offer an overall proposition that is comparable in terms of overall benefit-cost to that of the
DSO-powered alternative.
4.2.1
Where a RES is not able to have a favourable benefit-cost ratio then a threshold BCR should not be
assumed.
NOTE
Reporting energy use and carbon emissions is vital to ensure a full account of climate change and
energy impacts when appraising and evaluating projects.
Capital expenditure (CapEx) appraisal
4.3
The CapEx for both the RES and the DSO-powered alternative shall be assessed in order to provide a
basis of comparison.
4.4
CapEx for both the RES and DSO-powered systems shall include the full cost of design, procurement,
installation and commissioning.
4.4.1
Costs should be based on sources and historical pricing data such as; equipment supplier quotes, DSO
connection quotes or recent costs for similar works on other projects.
Operational & maintenance expenditure (OpEx) appraisal
4.5
An assessment of the operation and maintenance requirements of the RES shall be carried out with
respect to working on the motorways and all-purpose trunk road network environment and the
Operations directorate, or equivalent, will be consulted.
4.6
This assessment of the operation and maintenance of the RES shall include:
1)
maintenance tasks that are required for the reliable operation of the RES;
2)
expected frequency and duration of these tasks considering the harsh environment on the
motorways and all-purpose trunk road network;
3)
maintenance staff skills & competencies required and expected duration of maintenance tasks;
4)
understanding the safety and cost implications of working on live road networks;
5)
impact of maintenance tasks on system operation (e.g. whether they result in interruption to
supply); and,
6)
other impacts (e.g. whether maintenance requires restriction on access to other areas, temporary
traffic management etc.).
4.6.1
Maintenance task frequency should take into account the environment and conditions of the motorways
and all-purpose trunk road network and the requirement for periodic tasks required to keep the RES
operational.
NOTE
For example, removal of dirt and salt residue from PV arrays where its build-up could adversely affect
the RES performance.
4.7
Whole life costing shall follow BS ISO 15686-5 [Ref 1.N].
4.8
OpEx for both the RES and the DSO-derived supply alternative shall be assessed in order to provide a
basis of comparison.
4.9
An allowance linked to Construction Output Price Indices (OPI) shall be included for increasing the
operation and maintenance costs.

4. Economic appraisal
4.10
The expected lifetime of components within the RES shall be estimated and allowance made for any
components that are expected to require replacement during operating life of the RES.
NOTE
Guidance can be sought from equipment manufacturers on maintenance requirements.
4.11
Decommissioning costs shall be included as part of the OpEx appraisal process.
Carbon saving calculator
4.12
An appraisal shall be undertaken on the carbon savings, of DSO supplies versus RES alternatives,
over the whole life of the equipment supplied.
4.12.1
Guidance on carbon savings should be taken from the Overseeing Organisation's carbon appraisal or
calculator scheme or, where unavailable, a suitable alternative.
NOTE 1
An example of an OO carbon appraisal or calculator scheme is the National Highways carbon
emissions calculation tool HECT [Ref 3.I]and the associated guidance HECT(G) [Ref 4.I].
NOTE 2
There are standardised approaches and guidance documents such as the DMRB LA 114 [Ref 2.I] and
the publicly available standard PAS 2080 [Ref 1.I]. These resources give guidance how to measure
carbon and what is to be included in your calculations.
