Introduction
Introduction
Background
This standard is introduced as part of an objective to support the adoption of new guidance and best
practice into application as quickly as possible. This will supplement Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I], which will continue to retain the majority of guidance and best practice relating
to road works and temporary situations.
The Traffic Signs Manual chapters are subject to cyclical updates, around every three to four years at
present, therefore leaving a significant period of time between publications. Currently there are limited
other opportunities to disseminate new guidance and best practice relating to road works and
temporary situations into industry for consideration.
This standard will ensure that industry, customers and stakeholders will be facilitated to realise the
benefits of new practice and guidance more efficiently. The content will largely be located within the
appendix of this standard, as it will be the decision of temporary traffic management (TTM) designers
and schemes as to when it is incorporated into their works, in line with current working practices.
However, it should better support the industry in making decisions relating to the design and operation
of TTM given the continued updates to guidance through this mechanism.
It is envisaged that content situated in this standard will transfer into future iterations of TSM Chapter 8
[Ref 3.I]where applicable. This will be determined via existing governance and procedures and would
need to be consented to by the devolved administrations and other identified stakeholders.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.

Appendix A. Enhanced mobile carriageway closure
Appendix A. Enhanced mobile carriageway closure
A1
Overview of enhanced mobile carriageway closure
Traffic Signs Manual TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]provides guidance for those responsible for the design
and operation of temporary traffic management (TTM). It is expected that those persons looking to
utilise the enhanced mobile carriageway closure (EMCC) outlined within this document are suitably
trained and possess the relevant qualifications to adopt this technique. They should also be both
experienced and familiar with the principles of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I] and TTM.
On dual carriageway roads, including motorways, some traffic management tasks and works
operations may need to be conducted on the carriageway using a temporary traffic free zone (TFZ),
where the road is clear of passing traffic for a short period of time. The installation or movement of a
short length of coning and signing to change the configuration of a TTM layout during road works,
which takes less than 5 minutes, is one such example where this may be required.
The mobile carriageway closure (MCC) and the convoy control vehicle technique are existing and
established techniques with guidance outlined in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]. They are operated by the
traffic Authority or contractor using signs to provide warnings and information relating to restrictions or
changes in carriageway conditions. The traffic signs used as part of these techniques are done so by
the powers provided by Sections 64/65 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 UKPGA 1984/27
(RTRA) [Ref 6.N]. EMCC signs require authorisation for each highways/road Authority they are used
on. At the time of publication the only authorisation is for National Highways' roads. For their use on
other Overseeing Organisation's roads one should check with the relevant national body responsible
for signs authorisations.
The EMCC, as described in this document, is a development of both the aforementioned techniques.
Whilst the EMCC includes the word "closure" its use does not include planned closures of the
carriageway by bringing traffic to a stop (see Section A2).
The implementation and selection of any technique for an operation should be considered and
evaluated as part of the planning phases. Both contractors and the Authority should be aware that the
EMCC is to be considered as a potential method of working alongside other existing and established
TTM techniques.
It is essential that the use of the EMCC technique does not transfer risk from road workers to road
users. The principles of ALARP need to be adhered to as outlined in TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I].
Temporary traffic free zones have traditionally been created by requesting police or traffic officer
support to implement a rolling road block. With the emergence of the EMCC, requests for police or
traffic officers to support planned work activities should begin to be limited to unplanned incidents.
The traffic free zone created by the EMCC allows for traffic management operations to be conducted in
a sterile area. EMCC can be used for the installation, maintenance, switching or removal of any
temporary traffic management layout and pre-setting of equipment. It can also be used to support the
maintenance of a traffic management system such as when live lane working is required for crossing a
carriageway to maintain traffic management equipment, managing displaced traffic management
equipment and retrieving debris, all of which are expected activities occurring as part of planned works.
The EMCC technique can be used for short-term works operations to avoid a planned total closure of
the carriageway. This technique may be useful for the installation of TTM exit slip road detail, as it
eliminates the need for a temporary short term exit slip road closure.
The EMCC technique described in this document may be suitable for use on dual carriageways and
motorways with up to four lanes. Where used on four lane carriageways up to a maximum of one
additional lane from a junction (e.g. a parallel merge) can be incorporated. This technique may also be
used on slip or link roads where safe and practicable to do so.

traffic conditions, initially showing rear signing to Diagram 7404 'HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE' with
chevrons and rear beacons on (Figure A.1 Aspect A).
The EMCC vehicle will then change to show rear signing formed of an upper panel of the red 'X' and a
lower panel of the sign to Diagram 7029 "CONVOY VEHICLE NO OVERTAKING with rear beacons off
(see Section A6) to create a lateral closure across the carriageway. The speed of the EMCC vehicle is
then gradually and steadily reduced from the 85th percentile speed of private cars and light vehicles to
around 10 mph.
It is this slowing of traffic at a controlled rate which creates a traffic free zone downstream between the
EMCC vehicle(s) and the traffic moving away at normal speed in front of the EMCC vehicle, creating
time for the works operation to be undertaken. To ensure the traffic free zone is a safe and sterile area,
any hard shoulders, emergency areas or other identified stopping places for vehicles need to be
confirmed as clear, prior to the work commencing.

Appendix A. Enhanced mobile carriageway closure
When the last of the traffic downstream of the EMCC vehicle has passed the proposed working area,
(Figure A.1 Aspect B), work on the carriageway can commence in the traffic-free zone.
The EMCC vehicle(s) moves towards the working area (Figure A.1 Aspect C) travelling at a reduced
speed of around 10 mph (see Figure A.2). Before the EMCC vehicle(s) reaches a minimum of 200 m
upstream of the working area, the carriageway is restored to a safe arrangement for the passage of
traffic and personnel located in a place of relative safety.
Figure A.2 Typical EMCC operation speed and distance chart
When the relevant operation has been confirmed as completed or suspended via radio communication
it is essential that the EMCC vehicle(s) steadily build up speed (to between 30 to 40 mph). This is to
space out the traffic behind the EMCC vehicle and allow traffic to change lanes, if required, before
resuming normal speed. When the EMCC vehicle(s) has passed through the area of works operation
for which the EMCC has been put in place, they will change to showing the rear signing to Diagram
7404 'HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE' and chevrons. They then move to the left-hand lane of the
carriageway to allow traffic to pass. The operation is then complete.
A2.2
Unplanned stops
An EMCC is not permitted to bring traffic to a planned stop to allow a works operation. Traffic may only
be brought to a controlled stop in the event of an incident or emergency arising during the operation.
Where no official confirmation, via radio communication, is received from the works team that the
working area is clear from personnel at the boundary of the safety zone (a minimum of 200 m prior to
the working area) then the EMCC vehicle slowly brings traffic to an unplanned stop around 100 m from
the working area.
Where an unplanned stop occurs, the relevant control room needs to be contacted immediately.
Subsequently, the Authority is informed whenever traffic has been brought to a stop through this
technique and the event recorded as an unplanned incident. The Authority should also be informed of

any near misses, incursions or incidents, prior to, during or shortly after the EMCC which may be
related to the operation. Such events are to be recorded by the Authority.
A2.3
Communications
Work in a traffic free zone needs to be supported by a functioning digital incursion warning system as
one of the primary means of managing the residual risk of any vehicle passing the EMCC. A dedicated
two-way radio system also needs to be provided as a supporting secondary means of verbal
communication between the EMCC vehicle and the working area.
Multiple crews can work in one traffic free zone. Where more than one crew works in one traffic free
zone it is essential that they are connected to the same two-way radio communication channel and
incursion warning system. When the EMCC vehicle(s) activates an alarm or communicates with the
working areas all crews will receive the same message simultaneously.
A2.4
Digital incursion warning system
The use of the EMCC technique is underpinned by using a digital incursion warning system activated
when there is breach by any vehicle, inclusive of emergency vehicles. The incursion warning system
needs to be manually activated by the EMCC vehicle operator which immediately delivers an audible
and visual alarm, warning of an errant vehicle to all persons in the working area, allowing them to move
to a place of relative safety. The EMCC vehicle may need to continue to proceed at the reduced speed
up to the proposed working area, until the operation has been confirmed as suspended.
The warning system will need to automatically deliver an alert at 500 m prior to the approach working
zone and then an incursion alarm at 200 m prior to the safety zone (See Figure A.3). 200 m is the
minimum distance for the final automatic alarm. Where a larger safety zone is implemented e.g. 300 m,
the final alarm should be aligned to the same distance of 300 m.
Figure A.3 Minimum digital incursion warning system alert distances
The digital incursion warning system is automatically activated when the sign on the rear of the EMCC
vehicle changes to Figure A.8. When the rear of the vehicle is showing signing to Figure A.9 it is
deactivated. Where the EMCC vehicle is travelling at a speed equal to, or greater than, 30 mph the
alert at 500 m will still sound, but the automatic alarm at 200 m will not.
In the unlikely event of a total communication failure, including the failure of the digital incursion
warning system and radio communication during the operation, the EMCC is not to be aborted as this
may compromise the safety of the personnel in the working area. The EMCC vehicle(s) should proceed
with caution at the reduced speed towards the working area. If the carriageway is not clear of
personnel and/or equipment then the EMCC comes to an unplanned stop.
A2.5
Multiple passes for one works operation
Works need to be planned to ensure the number of passes conducted are kept to an absolute
minimum, to reduce the impact on the road network. Consultation with the Authority is generally
required if more than two passes are anticipated to establish traffic management layout on one
carriageway. Where appropriate, pre-placement of traffic management equipment may be undertaken
to reduce the consecutive number of passes to establish the works (see Figure A.4).

Design and planning considerations
This document does not distinguish between the differing features of a carriageway such as a
'controlled motorway', 'dynamic hard shoulder' or 'all lane running'. These characteristics need to be
assessed at the design and planning stage of the works, along with any risk mitigations based on the
site.
In general, the duration required to create the sterile area should be planned to generally remain in the
5-to-7-minute range, and should not exceed 9 minutes, before the EMCC vehicle starts to accelerate
from 10 mph to release traffic back to free flow conditions.
At an average speed of 10 mph the EMCC vehicle and traffic behind it will cover around 300 m every
minute. The distance upstream, and therefore the traffic free zone, needs to be identified based on;
1)
the 500 m area of deceleration at the EMCC start point;
2)
the number of minutes required for the working window multiplied by 300 m; and,
3)
plus a minimum 200 m of longitudinal safety zone.
Maintaining a minimum longitudinal safety zone of 200 m between the working area and the EMCC
was shown in the trials to support a safe system of working, although a safety risk assessment should
determine the required distance.
A traffic sign arrangement consisting of signs to Diagram 584 and Diagram 7003.1 UKSI 2016/362
(TSRGD) [Ref 7.N] (see Section A6) need to be erected upstream of the EMCC start point on all
approach carriageways including slip and link roads when using the technique (see Figure A.5).

The presence of features such as entry slip roads or lane gain/drops within the traffic free zone

implemented. This can include a slip road closure, or additional EMCC vehicles being provided and
coordinated to merge to continue downstream of an entry point (Figure A.6). TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]

A3.1
Traffic flow and volumes
When installing and removing TTM, this technique can be suitable for use in traffic conditions that
exceed the definition of low traffic flow as defined by TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]. The designer needs to
assess the likely capacity of the traffic management system after installation of the TTM using Table
A.2, to decide a time to commence use of the technique to decelerate traffic from normal traffic speed.
Suitability of the technique and when it can be used will be determined by the designer and is subject to
a risk assessment. This technique is less suitable for use where traffic volumes are generally less than
400 vehicles per hour, irrespective of the number of lanes remaining open, as there can be larger gaps
in approaching traffic leading to delays in forming the EMCC.
When removing traffic management at night-time, contractors may need to wait until traffic arriving in
groups exceeding 200 vehicles per hour or free flow traffic conditions of over 400 vehicles per hour
spread over all lanes.
Safety of the platoon is maximised when the EMCC vehicle(s) progressively and steadily decelerates
traffic from the 85th percentile speed of private cars and light vehicles to the lowest speed required to
create the traffic free zone.
When work is confirmed as completed and it is safe to proceed, traffic is steadily led back to between
30 and 40 mph for a short period before the traffic controlled by the EMCC vehicle is released. Sudden
deceleration(s) and acceleration(s) of traffic should be minimised.
Safety risk assessments support the decision making process to determine the most appropriate traffic
management and on-site work activity. Where EMCC is selected, it is essential to include reference to
its use during the road space booking and coordination process, and contractor liaison, with the
relevant Authority and control room representatives.
A contractor can create a traffic free zone at a location of planned works for any task between the first
advanced warning sign and the end of road works signs. Where the task is at the extremities of the
advance zone the technique can be implemented upstream of the first sign location.
Road space does not need to be extended beyond the parameters normally booked when using the
technique, as Part 1 of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]Table 3.3 "Distance between sites" normally provides

sufficient space. However, the Authority needs to be consulted during the planning of the works to
ensure that impact to the network is managed and coordinated as part of the risk assessment.
A Temporary Traffic Regulation Order (TTRO) is not required to use this technique, but a TTRO may be
required for the road works.
A4
Operator and staff training
When undertaking an EMCC operation the operator of the EMCC vehicle needs to be a competent,
qualified individual and they will have completed a recognised training course in the use and operation
of the EMCC. It is essential that regular monitoring of EMCC operator performance occurs.
As with all work instructions and operations taking place on a live carriageway a briefing and equipment
testing takes place before the event. Briefing and testing on the EMCC will normally include items such
as communication protocols and time constraints, the incursion warning system and two-way radio
equipment prior to use. This needs to be covered as part of the risk assessment for the operation.
Where an EMCC vehicle is not used as part of an EMCC operation, such as for welfare facilities only,
the operator is not required to have completed the EMCC training.
A5
Signing
A5.1
Enhanced mobile carriageway closure vehicle signing
The EMCC vehicle(s) is a specially adapted vehicle displaying a sign arrangement that is authorised for
use in connection with the technique. Where the authorised sign is correctly displayed and used it is an
offence for a member of the public to overtake the EMCC vehicle.
The authorised vehicle mounted sign arrangement consists of a lower panel sign to Diagram 7029
'CONVOY VEHICLE NO OVERTAKING' . This is supported by an upper panel consisting of an active
light source displaying a steady red 'X' with alternating lamps (see Section A6) for when an EMCC is in
operation.
Deviation from the design of the lower panel including its dimensions, vinyl specification and size of the
surrounding yellow lower panel from what is authorised would not be considered a traffic sign. The
upper panel arrangement can only be altered to another manufacturer's red 'X' where there is an
authorisation of the active light source.
The sign arrangement needs to be capable of being operated from the cab of an EMCC vehicle. In the
case of equipment failure the sign needs to be capable of being manually returned to Diagram 7404
UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 7.N].
When the EMCC vehicle is not used as part of the operation the rear sign shows Diagram 7404 UKSI
2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 7.N] 'HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE' sign and chevrons (see Section A6) with the
upper panel being blank.
A5.2
Approach signing
The sign arrangement shown in Section A6 replaces the requirement to display the Diagram 7003.1
'WORKFORCE IN ROAD-SLOW' sign when this technique is used to create a traffic free zone.
When a technique is being used to install a traffic management system it is essential that the EMCC
vehicle does not pass the lane indication signs to Diagram 7202.1 UKSI 2016/362 (TSRGD) [Ref 7.N]
until those signs display the correct indication of the layout of the reduction in lanes being installed. The
traffic management contractor needs to provide adequate resources to achieve this.
When motorway incident detection and signalling (MIDAS) is available it should be used but disabled
downstream of the first cone of the taper. However, MIDAS needs to remain in operation upstream of
the first cone, as is the current normal operational practice in road works.

Appendix A. Enhanced mobile carriageway closure
A5.3
Variable signs and signals (VSS) with the enhanced mobile carriageway closure
In general, when this technique is used the overhead VSS commonly set to support the presence of
stationary traffic management vehicles in live traffic lanes do not need to be set. The signals normally
consist of a series of lane usage indications and reduced speed mandatory limits but as this technique
eliminates traffic from the hazard of stationary traffic management vehicles and travels at a much lower
speed, the signal indications are superfluous.
On those occasions where VSS are used as the primary advanced signs for road works, replacing
roadside advance signs, the signing methodology outlined in this section will need to be adapted
appropriately and the requirements of D6.13.13 in TSM Chapter 8 Part 1 and U2.15.29 to .32 in TSM
Chapter 8 Part 3 TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I]will need to be met. In circumstances where signals are set,
conflicting signs and messages to the road user need to be eliminated.
The contractor notifying or requesting permission to commence the EMCC with the relevant control
room establishes a clear understanding whether the VSS are required. Reference should be made in
communications to the control room operator that the "enhanced mobile carriageway closure" is being
used.

The authorised sign arrangement is formed of an upper panel, the red 'X', which currently can
only be formed of an LED panel, and a lower panel of the sign to Diagram 7029 "CONVOY
VEHICLE NO OVERTAKING" .
2)
The illumination of the upper panel red 'X' would need to automatically switch off any warning
beacons and lamps in the rear half of the vehicle.

It is essential that the means of switching from this sign to Figure A.9 is done from the operator's
cab. A prism sign was used in the trial vehicle. The roller blind is not prohibited, but there is no
known material suitable for a roller blind which meets the above performance classes.

It is essential that road users are always presented with identical signs when approaching identical
situations and therefore the design should not be deviated from. The 150 x-height / 1200mm size sign
need to be used on roads with a speed limit of 60 or 70 mph and a smaller 125 x-height / 900 mm sign
may be used on roads with an 85th percentile speed of around 50mph.
A yellow or grey backing board may be used with yellow being recommended on wider carriageways.

10)
display an agreed logo on each side, normally of the traffic or highway Authority with a unique
identification number to the vehicle e.g., "001" in characters of 375 mm character height in
Transport Heavy font to enable highway users to identify the EMCC vehicle to the contractor; and,
11)
display the company or project logo on the driver and passenger doors.
Images of the trial vehicles are provided below and contractors need to maintain uniformity of vehicle
presentation to support ongoing road user comprehension and technique safety. The EMCC vehicle
may also perform another function such as a welfare van. However, the only staff who are permitted to
travel in the vehicle during an EMCC are the trained operator and any one person supporting,
assessing, training or supervising the operator.
The signs on the rear of the EMCC vehicle need to be regularly inspected for cleanliness and reflective
condition. To ensure the suitability of the signs and vinyl refer to the sign condition assessment guide in
TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 3.I].
