Introduction
Introduction
Background
The requirements and advice given in this document are based upon the guidance in BS EN 1295-1
[Ref 25.N]. Further guidance for the structural design of buried pipelines in the UK can be found in BS
9295 2010 [Ref 11.N].
BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N] contains a National Annex A which states the vehicle loadings to be used for
pipeline design. These loadings were derived from BS 5400-2 2006 [Ref 24.N], which has since been
revised. The loadings reported in BS 5400-2 2006 [Ref 24.N] are still employed in pipeline design as
they give a more conservative result than loadings derived from newer standards.
The charts and tables given at the appendices are based on BS 5400-2 2006 [Ref 24.N] and BS 9295
2010 [Ref 11.N]. These charts and tables provide a simplified method for defining the pipe and bedding
combinations required for permitted vehicle loading requirements and to be compliant with the range of
permitted combinations given in CC 500 [Ref 8.N] and Section 4 of this document.
CC 500 [Ref 8.N] permits a range of pipes of different material properties to be used for drainage works
in highways. This document also allows a choice in the method of bedding pipes where the degree of
structural support given to the pipe when it is laid in a trench varies. Not all possible combinations of
pipe and bedding selected from the permitted options will be suitable for a particular design solution.
Permitted combinations are therefore specified for each contract. The charts given in the appendices to
this document are intended for a wide range of pipe bedding combinations for a range of manufactured
pipe thicknesses, possible trench widths and bedding factors.
This document supersedes the figures and requirements for pipe bedding previously shown in the
Highway Construction Details, F series (HCDs F-series).
This document provides requirements and advice used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 8.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 12.N] apply to this document.

Where types Z and A are constructed in aggressive ground as defined in BRE SD-1 [Ref 21.N], a
suitably durable concrete mix should be used.
NOTE 1
For the material specification refer to 'Product requirements for bedding and surround material for
drainage pipes' and 'Product requirements for backfill material for drainage pipes' in CC 500 [Ref 8.N].
NOTE 2
Type Z is for use with any type of pipe for permanent protection against mechanical damage.
NOTE 3
Type T bedding for rigid pipes is less likely to be economic for the same degree of support.
NOTE 4
Different bedding combinations provide varying degrees of support to the pipe. In the case of combined
surface and sub-surface drains the granular bedding and surround additionally functions as a filter
medium.
NOTE 5
For specific information in relation to ancillary concrete refer to Section 9 of CD 350 [Ref 27.N].

NOTE 1
For the material specification refer to 'Product requirements for bedding and surround material for
drainage pipes' and 'Product requirements for backfill material for drainage pipes' in CC 500 [Ref 8.N].
NOTE 2
All bed types shown for filter drains are suitable for both rigid and flexible pipes.
NOTE 3
Type A material is intended for sub-soil drainage. The specification permits a wide grading envelope
from BS EN 13285 [Ref 29.N] so that local sources can be used as far as possible.
NOTE 4
When soils to be drained require a particular grading of filter aggregate it can be specified under the
heading Type C.
NOTE 5
Type B material is a coarse aggregate complying with BS EN 13242 [Ref 2.N], intended for use where
the drain is designed to intercept surface water flowing to the pipe. Grit from the carriageway could
slowly block this type of filter and it could require cleaning or replacement periodically.
NOTE 6
For specific information in relation to ancillary concrete refer to Section 9 of CD 350 [Ref 27.N].
4.5.2
The design should be based on knowledge of local sources of supply.
4.5.3
Where filter drains are located close to carriageways and are likely to be overrun by traffic, methods of
preventing the problem of 'stone scatter' should be assessed for effectiveness.
NOTE
Some possible solutions for stone scatter are shown in CD 524 [Ref 10.N].
4.6
The following performance characteristics shall be specified for Type C filter material in accordance
with BS EN 13285 [Ref 29.N]:
1)
material size;
2)
grading;
3)
oversize category;
4)
category for tolerances at mid-size sieves; and
5)
category for maximum fines.
4.7
The bases of trenches formed on water soluble soils shall be sealed with a waterproof geotextile
membrane protected by a layer of non-woven geotextile on each side.
4.8
Where a geotextile is required, this shall be designed in accordance with CD 524 [Ref 10.N].
Loading on pipes
4.9
Main road loading (which include motorways and all-purpose trunk roads) shall be applicable to pipes
under pavements including cross drains and for pipes in verges where heavy loads can occur.
4.10
Main road loading shall consist of eight wheel loads, each of 112.5 kN including impact factor, in the HB
loading pattern corresponding to 45 units of HB loading in accordance with BS 5400-2 2006 [Ref 24.N]
as reflected by BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N].
4.11
Field loading shall apply to fields and lightly trafficked access tracks.
4.12
Field loading shall consist of two wheels 1.0 m apart each of a static load of 30 kN with an impact factor
of 2.0 giving a total load for each wheel of 60 kN.
4.13
Filter drain loading shall be applicable to pipes in filter drains in verges and central reserves.
4.14
Filter drain loading shall correspond to outer verge loading specified with 30 units of HB loading with
each wheel load being 62.5 kN.
4.15
Only two wheel loads shall be used for filter drain loading but with an increased impact factor of 1.4
giving a total load for each wheel of 87.5 kN.
4.15.1
Filter drains not immediately adjacent to the carriageway may be designed for field loads.
4.16
Water loads, that is the weight of the pipe content, shall only apply to pipes greater than 600 mm
internal diameter.

NOTE
The design charts, included in Appendix A, Figures A.1 to A.3, cater for three categories of loading
conditions which include imposed surface loads together with soil and water loads as appropriate.
Loads during construction
4.17
Where imposed loads during construction exceed normal in-service loads, the design charts in
Appendix A of this document shall not be used.
4.18
Where pipes laid under and adjacent to roads are subject to higher loads during construction, guidance
shall be followed from: "A Guide to Design Loadings for Buried Rigid Pipes" by Young & O'Reilly
(TRRL) [Ref 1.N], BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N] or BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N].
Settlement
4.19
Where pipes are bedded in highly compressible soil, granular beds (types B, F and S) shall be used.
4.20
Where pipes are bedded in highly compressible soil, a geotextile filter in accordance with CD 524 [Ref
10.N]shall be designed on the base of the trench to prevent contamination of the bedding material.
Rigid pipe design
4.21
Rigid pipes shall be designed either in accordance with BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N] or with the design
charts in Appendix B.
NOTE 1
Rigid pipes are those which fracture before significant deformation occurs (such as those of clayware,
and concrete).
NOTE 2
The derivation of the design charts for rigid pipes in this document is in accordance with the principles
given in "A Guide to Design Loadings for Buried Rigid Pipes" Young & O'Reilly (TRRL) [Ref 1.N] and
"Simplified Tables of External Loads on Buried Pipelines" Young, Brennan & O'Reilly (TRRL) [Ref 3.I]).
4.21.1
Reference should be made to "A Guide to Design Loadings for Buried Rigid Pipes" Young & O'Reilly
(TRRL) [Ref 1.N] and "Simplified Tables of External Loads on Buried Pipelines" Young, Brennan &
O'Reilly (TRRL) [Ref 3.I] for the full theory and for the design of special cases not covered by the
appendices to this document.
4.22
The safe supporting strength of the pipe/bed combination Ws shall be given by Equation 4.22:
Equation 4.22 Safe supporting strength of the pipe/bed combination
Ws = Wt · Fm
Fs
where:
Wt
= crushing strength
Fm
= bedding factor
Fs
= factor of safety taken as 1.25
4.23
The allowable depth range of the pipes shall be determined such that Ws > W , where W is the total
load on a particular pipe at a given depth.
4.24
The load on the pipe shall be found with the "narrow trench" equation, as defined in "A Guide to Design
Loadings for Buried Rigid Pipes" Young & O'Reilly (TRRL) [Ref 1.N].
NOTE
The load on the pipe is directly related to the trench width. Thus if the width of trench constructed
exceeds the assumed design width then the load on the pipe is likely greater than the design load.
4.25
Where the "narrow trench" equation is used for pipes greater than 375 mm internal pipe diameter, the
trench width shall be taken as at least 700 mm greater than the pipe outside diameter. See Young &
O'Reilly (TRRL) [Ref 1.N].

4.26
For all pipes below 375 mm internal diameter the "wide trench" equation (see Young & O'Reilly (TRRL)
[Ref 1.N] ) shall be used to calculate the load on the pipe, and in this case no restriction on the trench
width is necessary.
Bedding factor
Carrier drains (Figure 4.3)
4.27
The bedding factors for rigid pipe design shall be in accordance with BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N], which
are summarised in Table 4.27 N2.
NOTE 1
The bedding factor is the ratio of the failure load for the pipe installed in the ground to its failure load in
a crushing test machine and is generally greater than unity.
NOTE 2
The bedding factors in Table 4.27 N2 , which have been taken from BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N], are the
values of the bedding factors that have been assumed for the bed types shown in this document.
Table 4.27N2 Bedding factors for narrow trench condition

Description
Bedding factor

1.1
S
granular surround
2.2
4.27.1
Though not constituting a bedding type in accordance with BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N], the bed type Z
"concrete surround" , may have an assumed bedding factor of 2.6.
Filter drains (Figure 4.5)
4.28
A bedding factor of 1.9 shall be used for bed types I, K and M.
NOTE
A bedding factor of 1.9 is used in order to allow for the full range of likely filter material.
4.29
A bedding factor of 2.2 shall be used for bed type H.
4.30
A bedding factor of 2.6 shall be used for bed types G, J and L.
Flexible pipe design
4.31
Flexible pipes shall be designed in accordance with BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N] and BS EN 1295-1 [Ref
25.N], or in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 8.N].
NOTE 1
Flexible pipes are those which deform to a significant extent before collapse (such as those in plastics,
or steel).
NOTE 2
Commonly, flexible pipes used for highway drainage are manufactured from thermoplastic materials.
NOTE 3
The design charts in Appendix A are based on a design method in BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N] for flexible
pipes which takes into account the relative stiffness of the pipe and the surrounding soil.
4.32
A maximum ring deflection (that is, change in diameter) of 5% and a factor of safety against ring
buckling of 2 shall be used to obtain the safe depth ranges.
4.32.1
The pipe bed surround E values provided in Table 3.26.1N1 should be used in the design process for
the design of flexible pipes provided in BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N] and BS EN 1295-1 [Ref 25.N].

4. Design of pipe and bedding combinations for d...
NOTE 1
The degree of compaction of the pipe bedding material has a significant effect on the results and
consequently the worst case, with the material in a loose condition, has been assumed. The
corresponding E values used are provided in Table 4.32.1N1.
Table 4.32.1N1 Bed type E values
Bed type
Description
Surround E value
S
granular surround
5 MPa
T
sandy surround
2 MPa
All
filter drains
5 MPa
NOTE 2
The strength of a thermoplastic pipe is a function of the initial pipe stiffness and the modulus E of the
native soil material through which the trench has been excavated, and that of the pipe bedding and
surround. The compaction of the sidefill material is, therefore, fundamental to the performance of
flexible/semi rigid pipes.
Design assumptions
4.33
The design assumptions in this section shall be used when designing pipe/bedding combinations with
the charts in Appendix A.
4.33.1
Class T bedding should not be specified for main road loading situations.
NOTE
Granular bedding material is deemed to be relatively self compacting and provides adequate support
with minimal compaction. It is the preferred bedding material
4.34
The embedment for semi-rigid and flexible pipes shall be as set out in Table NA8 of BS EN 1295-1 [Ref
25.N].
NOTE
Thermoplastic pipes principally comprise those manufactured from PVC-u, polyethylene and
polypropylene, though there are variations. The performance of each polymer is different and is
dependent on the initial pipe stiffness, and the creep ratio.
Withdrawal of trench supports during backfilling
4.35
Coefficients for soil modulus and bedding angle of friction relating to the removal of trench support
systems shall be in accordance with BS 9295 2010 [Ref 11.N].
NOTE 1
The withdrawal of trench support systems is usually completed in stages.
NOTE 2
When pipes are laid in trenches where the sides are supported by trench support systems, the values
of the soil modulus and the bedding angle of friction are reduced by a coefficient depending on the
stage during the backfill process at which the support system is withdrawn.
4.35.1
Where trench support systems are withdrawn in stages before each layer of backfill is compacted, the
friction coefficient should be taken as unity.
4.35.2
Where trench support systems are removed in stages after the backfill is compacted, the friction
coefficient should be taken as 0.6.
NOTE
A friction coefficient of 0.6, for when trench support systems are removed in steps after the backfill is
compacted, is recommended by most pipe manufacturers.
4.35.3
Where the trench support systems are withdrawn after the trench is completely backfilled, the friction
coefficient should be taken as 0.2.
4.35.4
Withdrawing trench support systems after the trench is completely backfilled should be avoided.

Appendix C. Worked example
Appendix C. Worked example
The design charts for determining safe pipe/bedding combinations are given in Appendix A. Figures
A.1, A.2 and A.3 of Appendix A are used to determine a pipe group number for three categories of
loading corresponding to main road, field and filter drain loadings respectively. Having determined the
group number, Figures B.1, B.2 or B.3 from Appendix B are then used to obtain the safe combination
for carrier drains or filter drains respectively.
As an example, consider a carrier pipe 300 mm in diameter located in the carriageway verge with depth
of cover of 2.0 m minimum and 3.0 m maximum.
For the location of the pipe it is decided that main road loading should be assumed and therefore
Figure A.1 would be applicable.
From Figure A.1 the group number corresponding to the minimum and maximum depth of cover to the
pipe is found to be group 7.
From Figure B.1 the permitted combinations are indicated by those having group numbers greater than
or equal to 7. For a 300 mm diameter pipe these are found to be:
Table C.1 300 mm diameter pipe

A,S,B,F
200
A,S,B,F,N
Precast concrete
120
A,S,B
Thermoplastic
S,T
For filter drains the procedure is similar except that the bedding strength provided by all filter drain
types shown in Figure 4.5 is acceptable. Thus the design is a check on the suitability of the pipe for the
given loading.
Using the previous example of a 300 mm diameter pipe from Figure A.3 the group number is found to
be 4. From Figure B.3 suitable pipes for a group number equal to or greater than 4 are found to be:
Table C.2 Suitable pipes for a group number equal to or greater than 4

It should be noted that in Tables B.1, B.2 and B.3 (Appendix B), where some group numbers are
omitted, it is because either the particular class of pipe is not usually manufactured in that diameter or
that the strength of the given pipe bed combination is insufficient.
When the properties of pipe materials are known, the methods detailed in the "Materials Selection
Manual for Sewers, Pumping Mains and Manholes" WSA 1993 [Ref 2.I] may be used to verify the
suitability of the pipes in accordance with the schedule in CC 500 [Ref 8.N].

Appendix D. Testing methods for thermoplastic structured wall pipes
D1
Test method for longitudinal bending
(i) The test specimen is to be a six-metre length of pipe or the maximum length available from the
manufacturer (if less than six metres);
(ii) The apparatus for the test is to include:
1)
two level support blocks at least 250 mm wide and of sufficient height to allow the pipe to sag
over its length without touching the ground; and,
2)
a means of measuring the vertical distance between the pipe at the centre of the span and a fixed
point of reference to an accuracy of ±0.5mm.
(iii) The test procedure:
1)
condition the specimen for at least 1 hour at 23°C ± 2°C;
2)
set the supports at a distance apart equal to the length of pipe minus 500 mm;
3)
place the pipe symmetrically on the supports;
4)
measure the distance between the top of the supports and the fixed point of reference, in the
vertical axis through the centre line of the pipe;
5)
after a period of two minutes measure the distance between the underside of the pipe at mid
span and the fixed point of reference; and,
6)
record the difference in readings as a percentage of pipe length.
D2
Test method for rodding resistance (internal puncture)
(i) The test specimens are to be:
1)
twenty specimens cut from the structured wall pipe, each specimen to be 242 mm to 246 mm in
length and a quarter section of the circumference; or,
2)
twenty specimens cut from a number of identical fittings.
(ii) The apparatus for the test is to include:
1)
a standard drop weight pipe testing apparatus capable of dropping a tup from a height of 1 m;
2)
a 300g tup which can be varied in 30g multiples with a striker consisting a steel rod 18 mm in
diameter with a 9 mm hemispherical end; and,
3)
a 250 mm x 250 mm box containing dry Leighton Buzzard sand (Garside quarry) such that there
is at least 100 mm of sand beneath the test specimen when bedded down.
(iii) The test procedure is as follows:
1)
mark the intended point on the inside of the pipe on the intersection of the centre lines. With
profiled pipes the point of impact is to be at the point nearest the intersection that mid way
between the ribs or in the middle of a hollow corrugation;
2)
alternatively mark the intended point of impact on the section of fitting;
3)
condition the test specimens in air at a temperature of 4°C ± 2°C for a period of at least one hour
before the test;
4)
locate the box under the drop tube of the impact apparatus;
5)
embed the specimen into the sand using a vibrator with the inner surface exposed and facing
upwards;
6)
locate the specimen such that the marked point of impact is under the centre line of the tup;
7)
drop the tup from a height of 1 m onto the inner surface of the specimen within 10 seconds of
removing the specimen from the conditioning environment;

8)
examine the specimen for damage. Damage is defined as a puncture or crack of the inner layer.
Ductile bending or "whitening" is not considered to be damage;
9)
if the specimen exhibits no damage the next test is to be conducted with a tup of 30 g greater
mass. If the specimen does exhibit damage the next test is to be conducted using a tup of 30 g
smaller mass; and,
10)
after having completed the 20 strikes calculate the average of the energies where a pass (no
damage) was recorded and the average of the energies where a failure (damage) was recorded,
then calculate the average of the two averages.
(iv) The test report is to include:
1)
identification of the samples;
2)
identification of the samples; and
3)
whether or not the specimens were damaged.
D3
Test method for resistance to sharp objects
(i) Test specimens are three samples of duct each 300 mm long.
(ii) The apparatus includes:
1)
a compression testing machine;
2)
a 4.7 mm diameter steel rod with an hemispherical end; and
3)
a 120° steel block at least 300 mm long.
(iii) The test method:
1)
condition the test specimens for at least 1 hour at 23°C ± 2°C;
2)
insert the steel rod in the jaws of the movable platen of the compression testing machine so that
the hemispherical end protrudes at least 15% of the nominal pipe diameter;
3)
position the specimen in the the block and place directly below the steel rod. For twin-walled pipe
the specimen is to be positioned firstly so that the rod strikes on the corrugation or rib, and
secondly in the valley (where possible);
4)
set the machine to lower at a rate of 5 mm/min; and
5)
allow the rod to travel into the pipe a distance equal to 10% of the nominal internal diameter of
the pipe (T10 mm) or until the pipe wall is perforated. When the outer skin of a twin wall pipe is
perforated before 10% is attained, the rod travel up to the point of failure is to be recorded (Tf
mm) and the rod allowed to travel to the inner wall. The rod travel is to be continued to a total of
10% (i.e. T10 - Tf) or until complete penetration occurs.
(iv) For each test specimen: pipe size, reference, maximum load and rod travelare to be recorded.
D4
Variations in test method
Variations in the test methods specified within this appendix can be made where deemed necessary by
the British Board of Agrément (or equivalent) following consultation with the manufacturer and in
agreement with the Overseeing Organisation. All such variations are to be recorded in the report.
