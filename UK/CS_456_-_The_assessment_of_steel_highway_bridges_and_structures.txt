Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives requirements for the assessment of existing steel structures and structural
elements on motorways and other trunk roads.
This document was developed to assess structures designed using BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N], BS 5400-10
[Ref 4.N] and older Standards.
The requirements for assessment are presented as additions and amendments to the design clauses
and annexes of BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] for static strength, and BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N] for fatigue strength.
These additions and amendments have been specifically developed to suit assessment conditions.
The objectives of this document include:
1) To cater for structural forms that are not permitted by BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] and BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N]
or by BS EN 1993-2 [Ref 2.N].
2) To produce a more realistic assessment of the strength of steel elements than is possible using the
design codes. This is achieved in part by taking advantage of the information available during
assessment in respect of the material strength, geometric properties and imperfections, and actual
bridge usage which can only be predicted at design stage.
3) To amend some parts of BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] and BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N] which have been either
conservatively interpreted for use in design, or updated by later evidence allowing a less conservative
interpretation.
This document also includes updates to BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] that were previously published in BD 13.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

Assessment processes and basis for assessment for static
strength
Assessment processes
2.1
The assessment processes described in CS 454 [Ref 1.N] shall be applied to static strength
assessment.
Basis of assessment
2.2
The provisions of BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] as amended by Appendix A and BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N] as
amended by this document shall be applied for assessment of existing steel structures and structural
elements.
NOTE 1
Appendix A is presented in the form of additions to BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] for assessment. The additions
in Appendix A have been specifically developed to suit assessment conditions.
NOTE 2
Clause references in Appendix A refer to BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] as amended by Appendix A.
2.3
Where a clause in BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] is not replaced or modified in Appendix A, the clause from BS
5400-3 [Ref 5.N] shall be applied for assessment without modification.
2.4
Annexes in Appendix A and in BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] that are termed Normative shall be applied for
assessment.
2.5
Annexes in Appendix A and in BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] termed Informative shall be applied for assessment
unless an alternative method is agreed with the Overseeing Organisation and documented in the
assessment basis.
Assessment Objectives
2.6
The assessment objectives shall be according to Section 4 of BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] as amended by
Appendix A.
NOTE 1
The assessment objectives include requirements for loads, partial factors and limit states for
assessment, and typically refer to CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 2
The assessment objectives include assessment of the SLS limit state according to BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N]
as amended by Appendix A.
NOTE 3
The partial factor γf3 in BS 5400-3 [Ref 5.N] and the assessment additions is included as a reduction to
the resistance. This approach differs from the usage in CS 454 [Ref 1.N]. The additional application of
this factor on the load side results in double counting.

Assessment process and basis of assessment for fatigue
General guidance
3.1
Fatigue assessment shall be undertaken for one or more of the following reasons:
1) where damage tolerance is poor and fatigue failure can cause premature loss of strength or
serviceability;
2) where fatigue life predictions are required in order to plan future maintenance.
NOTE
Fatigue analysis is not normally necessary for bridge assessment because it is not usually necessary to
repair or strengthen a structure at the present day just because it might theoretically need to be
repaired or strengthened at some time in the future.
3.2
Fatigue assessment shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in BS 5400-10 [Ref
4.N] and this document.
3.3
Fatigue assessment of shear connectors shall also take account of the provisions of CS 456 [Ref 7.N].
3.4
Highway bridges shall be assessed for fatigue for the standard design life of 120 years using the
standard traffic loading model and the annual flow of commercial vehicles given in Table 1 of BS
5400-10 [Ref 4.N] unless special circumstances apply (see Cl. 3.4.1 below).
3.4.1
Where special circumstances apply, a non-standard design life, a non-standard load spectrum or
non-standard vehicle flows may be used. Special circumstances can include:
1) temporary structures, which may employ a non-standard design life;
2) structures subject to weight restrictions, and accommodation bridges where the vehicle weights
depend upon a particular usage (such as access to a farm or factory), which may employ a
non-standard load spectrum;
3) structures that carry traffic flows substantially different from standard flows, which may employ
non-standard vehicle flow rates.
NOTE
Any special circumstances that currently apply to a particular structure can change during its design life.
3.5
Where a fatigue life prediction is required, the theoretical remaining fatigue life shall be determined in
accordance with the damage calculation procedures described in BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
A prediction of remaining life depends upon the actual past and predicted future traffic using the bridge.
It will therefore require realistic or conservative past and future traffic models to be defined.
3.6
The effective stress range for a welded detail shall include compression stresses.
NOTE
Compression stresses are considered to be just as damaging for fatigue assessment as tensile
stresses.
3.7
The fatigue life of any detail shall be based on the 2.3% probability of failure criterion as used to obtain
the design curves in Figure 14 of BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
This criterion is also implicit in the damage charts in Figure 10 and the limiting stress ranges in Figure 8
of BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N].
3.8
The modifications to fatigue assessment criteria provided by this document have been specifically
developed to suit assessment conditions and shall not be used in design or construction.
Corrections to BS 5400: Part 10: 1980
3.9
The following corrections shall be made to the text of BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N], as shown in Table 3.9 for
the purposes of this document.

Table 3.13a shall be used to assess whether fatigue shear checks at the end of the span are required.
If all the conditions noted in Table 3.13a are satisfied, no fatigue checks at the end of the span are
needed.

of loading as described in BS 5400-2 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
The stud connectors are assumed to have a design life of 120 years and be subjected to the standard
load spectra and traffic flows given in BS 5400-10 [Ref 4.N].
3.15
Table 3.13b shall be used to define the traffic model for accommodation bridges that have limited usage
and that are designed for HA loading only.

3. Assessment process and basis of assessment fo...
1) n = actual annual flow of particular vehicle type in traffic lane;
2) N = maximum allowable annual flow of particular vehicle type/lane if the traffic consisted of only this
vehicle type;
3) the stud shear connectors can be anywhere in the span and are assumed to be designed to the
minimum static strength requirements of BS 5400-5 [Ref 6.N]; and,
4) the bridges are assumed to be simply supported, single carriageway with one or two lanes.
NOTE
Some conservative assumptions have been made in deriving these tables. Thus even though a table
indicates that the fatigue strength or life is inadequate the connector can be found to be satisfactory
when detailed calculations are carried out.
Assessment: mid span regions
3.17
Stud connectors at mid-span regions shall be checked for fatigue even when Tables 3.13a and 3.13b
illustrate that the design of stud connectors is not governed by static considerations at the ends of a
span.
3.18
For plates less than 40 mm and greater than 12 mm, the effective life shall be taken as:
[calculated design life] · [1 −0.02[t −12]] , where t = plate thickness in mm .
3.19
For plates less than 100 mm and greater tor equal to 40 mm, the effective life shall be taken as:
[calculated design life] · [0.44 −0.004[t −40]] where t = plate thickness in mm .
3.20
Where structures have no specified fatigue loading criteria, welded connections with classification
inferior to Class F shall be assumed to be at risk of premature cracking.
NOTE
Some structures (including footbridges), have no specified fatigue load model. Some non-load-carrying
welded joints can attract uncertain stresses due to displacements. Inspection can be the only rational
approach to assessing such details.

4. 
Assessment objectives 
[BS5400, Replace clause 4.1.1 with] 
4.1.1 
Assessment Basis 
The basis of assessment shall align with the requirements of CS 454. 
NOTE 1 
This includes general requirements for verification that were covered by BS 5400-1. 
The compliance criteria for assessment of structural steelwork in existing bridges shall be in 
accordance with the design requirements, except as amended for assessment.  
Where other documents are used for derivation of load effects, analysis or other objectives, 
the principles and requirements of this document shall still be applied unless specifically 
stated otherwise.  
The information used for assessment shall be established or verified as required by Annex I 
and the inspection requirements of CS 454.  
NOTE 2 
An initial (preliminary) assessment will usually be carried out prior to full assessment to 
determine the criticality of components and thus avoid undue detailed assessment, 
inspections and analyses on non-critical elements. See further comments in 8.5.1 and Annex 
I in relation to imperfections and inspection. 
Assessment resistance shall be based on the requirements of this document. 
For purposes of assessment, alternative methods of calculating strength or resistance of 
elements may be used provided that the results of an adequate number of representative 
laboratory tests are performed to enable the statistical relationships between the strength or 
resistance by the alternative methods and the observed results to be obtained.  
The tests should be appropriate for the element being assessed with respect to: 
1) Loading and support conditions;
2) The effects of imperfections or eccentricities;
3) Material properties;
4) Dimensional parameters (such as slenderness);
5) For elements where the strength is influenced by residual rolling or welding stresses, the
size and fabrication procedures of the specimens to be similar to those of the elements
being assessed.
NOTE 3 
To provide significant benefit at least five relevant test results are generally needed, 
excluding any “outliers”.  
The relevant material properties (such as yield stress) should be obtained for the 
components of the specimens and allowed for in the theoretical or empirical predictions. 
Where geometric imperfections are important for models of failure, all relevant geometric 
imperfections in the specimen should be recorded and allowed for in the prediction method 
used, together with the actual cross sectional dimensions.  
[BS5400-3, Replace clause 4.1.2 with] 
4.1.2 
Assessment loads and combinations 
The loading for assessment of existing bridges shall be in accordance with CS 454.

The assessment should determine, in terms of vehicle loading, the carrying capacity of the 
structure as limited by the critical sections or elements.  
4.2.2  
Serviceability limit state 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 4.2.2, under Table 1] 
Where serviceability criteria in this standard cannot be met, the following information shall be 
determined and submitted to the Overseeing Organisation for approval before the 
assessment is undertaken: 
1) the level of the serviceability criteria at which there would be a loss of utility or public 
concern or excessive permanent deflection 
2) the proposed alternative criteria for assessment.  
NOTE 1 
The serviceability limit states for steel bridges are defined in 3.3 of BS 5400-1 and 4.2.2 of 
BS 5400-3 in general terms.  
NOTE 2 
The particular requirements of individual assessments can demonstrate the need for more 
specific serviceability checks or the possibility of accepting some levels of unserviceability 
depending on user requirements and individual circumstances. 
NOTE 3 
Where additional serviceability checks are required in further cases than Table 1 according 
to individual assessment circumstances, the requirements are set out in the relevant clauses.  
NOTE 4 
The following NOTES 5 to 10 are given in relation to Table 1 and the assessment notes 
where serviceability checks are required: 
NOTE 5 
For Clause 9.2.3.1(a), the value of the ratio between maximum and mean stress in particular 
will generally not be applicable and serviceability checks could be required for significantly 
lower ratios, (see 9.2.3 and use of ΨR). The intention of the check is to ensure that outer 
parts of wide flanges do not yield under SLS conditions with consequent loss of stiffness. For 
stiffened compression flanges this also serves as a control of premature buckling of the 
outermost stiffeners which have been designed elastically. The redistribution capacity of 
stiffened flanges cannot be simply determined even for compact sections. With possible 
lower ratios between 𝛾𝑓𝑙𝛾𝑓3 at ULS and that at SLS the serviceability check is ever more 
necessary (see further guidance in 9.2.3.1). 
NOTE 6 
Clauses 9.2.3.1(b) & 9.5.5 are intended as a control on permanent deformation under SLS 
conditions. Clearly the amount of permanent deformation depends on the proportions of a 
beam. 9.5.5 limits the strain allowed in the tension flange at ULS to twice the yield strain. 
With ratios between 𝛾𝑓𝑙𝛾𝑓3 for the two limit states (ie ULS/SLS) greater than 1.3 no yielding is 
expected at the SLS in a particular beam. Even in extreme cases the limitation on flange 
strain at the ULS serves to restrict permanent deformation at the SLS to a fraction of the 
elastic deflection.  
NOTE 7 
For Clauses 9.2.3.1(c) & 9.10.3.3, in assessment of the adequacy of existing beams, these 
clauses are necessary to limit permanent deflections under SLS loading. The limit to 
deformation of a deck plate is commonly set by criteria related to the performance of the 
surfacing. Permanent rutting could necessitate resurfacing. 9.10.3.3.1 deals with a loading 
condition not treated at ULS and in consequence the serviceability check of 9.10.3.3 is 
required. 
NOTE 8 
For Clauses 9.9.8 & 9.2.3.1(d), if the shape factor, S, is less than the ratio between 𝛾𝑓𝑙𝛾𝑓3 for 
the ULS and SLS respectively there can be no need for a SLS check for steel beams. 
However the check is included for assessment because it is increasingly likely for SLS to be 
critical due to the smaller partial factors which can used. 
NOTE 9 
For Clause 12.2.3, permanent strains due to secondary stresses are unlikely to cause 
permanent deflections of a bridge but they could cause buckling of non-compact sections. 
The check serves to avoid this (see further guidance in 12).

NOTE 10 For Clauses 14.2.3 & 14.5.4.1.2, when deflections resulting from bolt slip are shown to have 
no adverse effects, the criteria are waived (see further guidance in 14). 
4.3.2 
Safety factor format 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 4.3.2] 
Where deterioration or damage has occurred to the structure which cannot be included in the 
resistance calculation using measured dimensions or imperfections, a condition factor shall 
be estimated to represent the resistance remaining.  
Where a condition factor is required to be applied, the safety format to be used in applying 
the assessment requirements of this document shall be according to Equation 4.3.2: 
(𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝛾𝑓𝐿, 𝑄𝑘) ≤
𝐹𝑐(𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝜎𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑒𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠)
𝛾𝑓3𝛾𝑚
 Equation 4.3.2 
where 
Fc  
is the condition factor. 
𝑄𝑘, 𝛾𝑓𝐿 
are the Actions and load factors according to [BD21]. 
NOTE 1 
Condition factors are not intended to cover deficiencies of the materials in a structure that are 
separately allowed for in the calculation of resistance, for example in cases where the 
strength of deficient material is calculated from testing. 
Loads used with the clauses in this document should not include 𝛾𝑓3 as a partial factor. 
NOTE 2 
The partial factor 𝛾𝑓3 in this document and in BS 5400-3 is already included as a reduction to 
the resistance and use on the load side would result in double counting. 
[BS5400-3, Replace existing clause 4.3.3 with] 
4.3.3 
Values of partial factors 
The partial factor 𝛾𝑓3 shall be taken from CS 454. 
NOTE 2 
The partial factor 𝛾𝑓3 is applied throughout this document as a reduction to the resistance in 
accordance with 4.3.2, which is different to the approach in CS 454. 
Where measurements have been taken to verify the dimensional accuracy, the measured 
stresses closely resemble the load effects and approval from the Overseeing Organisation is 
obtained, the partial factor 𝛾𝑓3 may be reduced to 1.05 at the ultimate limit state. 
The partial factor 𝛾𝑓𝐿 shall be taken from CS 454. 
NOTE 3 
Where permanent locked in effects occur due to the weight of formwork added and removed 
at different stages, the same partial factor 𝛾𝑓𝐿 applies for both addition and removal. 
The partial safety factor 𝛾𝑚 shall be taken from Table 2, except where alternative methods of 
calculating strength and resistance are used.

4.5.1  
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 4.5.1] 
For existing bridges, any inaccessible surface that does not comply with 4.5.5.1 or 4.5.5.2 as 
appropriate shall be surveyed for corrosion losses in accordance with 8.7 and Annex I. 
The thickness for assessment shall be in accordance with 8.7.

Provision of drainage 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 4.5.2] 
Existing sealed box members and other hollow sections shall be inspected to determine 
whether water has collected in them.  
Water shall not be permitted to remain or continue to collect. 
NOTE 1 
Water can collect in nominally sealed members, possibly due to condensation from air 
passing through small welding pores. This can cause bursting due to freezing and internal 
corrosion.

4.5.6  
Thickness of weathering steel  
The thickness of material for assessment shall be taken as the specified thickness at 
construction reduced by a corrosion allowance but not exceeding the current measured 
thickness. 
The corrosion allowance should be taken in accordance with CD 340. 
NOTE 2 
The corrosion allowance for weathering steel is a reduction in thickness considered to cater 
for the loss of structurally effective material due to the developing rust patina during the 
remaining life of the structure. 
NOTE 3 
The loss of thickness is typically very small, but in some circumstances the material does not 
perform as intended and the corrosion is significant (e.g. with poor detailing or adverse 
environmental conditions).  
Where weathering steel surfaces receive corrosion protective treatment, the corrosion 
allowance may be taken as zero. 
For parts of a structure where the measured loss of thickness since the time of construction 
meets or exceeds the corrosion allowance, these parts shall be assessed based on the 
measured thickness and the parts protected by a corrosion protection system.

Robustness 
The load rating for the structure shall be determined without any reductions due to 
robustness.  
Additionally, the robustness of the structure should be considered during the preliminary 
assessment.  
Any areas of the structure having insufficient robustness such as to risk a loss of integrity in 
one or more critical structural components shall be considered for special assessment.  
Details of the areas with insufficient robustness and proposals for special assessment (if any) 
shall be submitted for approval to the Overseeing Organisation before the assessment is

of the concrete parts using CS 455, composite action shall not be assumed.

[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 5.6] 
Where permanent changes or residual effects arise from temporary attachments, the 
consequences shall be taken into account in assessment. 
NOTE 1 
Construction diaphragms and fixings can cause stress raisers and welding residual stress 
with the consequent potential risk of brittle fracture and fatigue. Where they have been 
removed it is possible that they can still cause adverse effects.

Performance 
NOTE 1 
Not applicable to assessment. 
 
[BS5400-3, Replace existing clause 6.2 with] 
6.2  
Nominal yield stress 
The nominal yield stress for assessment shall be derived in accordance with Annex H. 
For assessment of critical components in existing structures, nominal measured material 
thicknesses should be used where possible.  
For assessment of critical components in existing structures, the yield stress should be taken 
as either: 
1) the specified minimum yield stress, or  
2) the yield stress determined by test results without reduction to allow for thickness 
variability. 
NOTE 1 
The values of nominal yield stress given in 6.2 of BS5400-3 allow for the tolerances in 
thickness for rolled materials and provide consistent characteristic values of the ratio of the 
product of yield stress and thickness to that of nominal thickness and specified minimum 
yield stress. This is not always the case for assessment because yield strength can be 
derived from testing, and therefore does not include an allowance for thickness tolerance, 
however this remains valid because the assessment is based on measured thickness (see 
8.7) for critical components. 
 
 
 
Where beams of hybrid construction using steel with different grades are assessed, each 
part shall be assessed with the yield stress appropriate to that part. 
6.3  
Ultimate tensile stress 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 6.3] 
The ultimate tensile stress of tension elements and their connections of steel not complying 
with BS EN 10025, BS 4360, BS 15, BS 968 or BS5400-6 shall be established from mill test 
certificates or by tests on samples of the materials of the elements.  
Where test data is used to derive the values of the ultimate tensile stress, the method shall 
be applied as for yield stress according to Annex H. 
Where a plastic method of analysis is used in assessment in accordance with clause 7.5, the 
steel in the parts assumed to have plastic capacity shall comply with 1 or 2 below: 
1) BS EN 10025, BS 4360, BS 15 or BS 968 
2) have ultimate tensile stress not less than 1.1 𝜎𝑦  
where 
𝜎𝑦   
is the nominal yield stress derived in accordance with Annex H.

NOTE 1 
The available data shows that, for particular samples of BS 4360 structural steels, the 
coefficients of variation of yield stress and of ultimate stress are similar. Thus, the 
assumptions made regarding the variability of yield stress are a reasonable basis for 
determining ultimate stresses.  
The ultimate tensile stress may alternatively be assessed approximately by means of 
hardness test.  
6.4  
Ductility 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 6.4] 
Where one or more of the following methods are used for assessment: 
1) plastic method of analysis is used in accordance with 7.5, or 
2) the plastic moment capacity of a compact section is utilised, or 
3) redistribution of tensile stress is assumed, 
the ductility of the steel shall be not less than equivalent to an elongation of 15% on a gauge 
length 5.65(𝑆𝑜
0.5).  
where 
𝑆𝑜 
is the original cross-sectional area of the test piece. 
Where a plastic method of analysis is used, the strain capacity of the material at the ultimate 
tensile stress shall be at least 20 times the strain corresponding to the yield stress. 
NOTE 2 
In addition where plastic methods of global analysis are used, an adequate yield plateau is 
required. This is deemed to be satisfied if the stress-strain diagram for the steel shows that 
the ultimate strain corresponding to the ultimate tensile stress is at least 20 times the yield 
strain corresponding to the material yield stress. 
6.5 
Notch toughness 
6.5.1  
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 6.5.1] 
Existing structures shall meet the requirements of 6.5.4 or 6.5.5. Where structures do not 
comply with 6.5.4 or 6.5.5, the processes in 6.5.6 shall be applied.  
NOTE 1 
Earlier bridge design codes had lesser requirements for notch toughness, and sometimes 
none at all. The majority of bridges built before about 1970 therefore have, by today’s 
standards, either inadequate or unknown and probably inadequate notch toughness. These 
bridges have experienced low temperatures during service, with or without live load, 
depending on circumstances, yet there are very few recorded examples of failure due to 
brittle fracture. 
6.5.2  
Design minimum temperature 
 
[BS5400-3, Amend clause 6.5.2] 
The definition of 𝑈𝑒 shall be replaced with: 
𝑈𝑒 
is the minimum effective bridge temperature given in CS 454, in degrees 
Celsius.

6.5.3.5 
Rate of loading  
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 6.5.3.5] 
Where the impact loading from over height vehicles is assessed and at least 5.3 m 
headroom is available, the value of 𝑘𝑠 should be taken as 1.0. 
6.5.4 
Maximum permitted thickness  
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 6.5.4] 
The fracture toughness of the welds in tensile areas shall satisfy the minimum fracture 
toughness of the parent material or where permitted by BS5400-6 the relaxed limits for welds 
with overmatching strength.

6.5.5 
Energy Absorption  
Where the requirements of 6.5.4 are not met, the energy absorption measured in joules, 𝐶𝑣, 
of the material used to resist the applied tensile stress shall satisfy the inequality in Equation

type 1 
is any part which is subjected to applied principal tensile stress at the ultimate 
limit state (ignoring geometric stress concentrations) greater than 100 N/mm2 
and which in addition has either 
1. any welded connection or attachment, or
2. welded repair of surface defects and has not been subsequently inspected
by crack detection of at least a 10% random sample, or 
3. punched holes which have not been subsequently reamed.
type 2 
is all parts subjected to applied tensile stress and which are not type 1. 
𝐶𝑣 
is the energy absorption in Charpy V-notch tests defined in BS EN 10025 and 
carried out at the design minimum temperature U (in joules). 
𝜎𝑦 
is the nominal yield stress. 
𝑡 
is the thickness of the plate or section in mm. 
Where in the assessment of the adequacy of the bridge either the tensile components do not 
satisfy the provisions of 6.5.4 or the impact energy absorption values are unknown, the 
energy absorption of the material, 𝐶𝑣, may be determined by testing samples taken from non-
critical areas of the components.

[BS5400-3, Add new clause 6.5.6] 
6.5.6 
Assessment of risk for non-compliant structures 
Where a structure does not comply with 6.5.4 nor 6.5.5, the risk level category shall be 
determined using the flow chart in Figure X.1 of Annex X.  
Structures in the risk level 1 category may be deemed satisfactory with no further 
assessment.  
Structures in the risk level 2 category shall be deemed non-compliant unless they are 
demonstrated to be satisfactory by alternative criteria or information. Any alternative criteria 
and information shall be submitted to the Overseeing Organisation for approval. 
NOTE 1 
The flow chart Figure X.2 gives guidance on the action to be taken if Risk Level 2 has been 
identified. 
NOTE 2 
Where non-compliance with the requirements of 6.5.5 is shown and the structure cannot be 
shown to comply with risk level 1, it can still be possible to deem a bridge satisfactory based 
on its form of construction, the then current design codes and steel specifications, and the 
service history of the bridge. For example, bridges which have been in service for a long 
period might have sufficient notch toughness to withstand normal traffic.  
The following information is important to provide in these circumstances: 
1) details of investigations carried out including test results; and
2) the load history e.g. actual abnormal load movements; and
3) the service history e.g. operation at low or very low temperatures; and
4) the details of any non-compliant joints; and
5) any evidence of cracking at non-compliant joints.
Where the fracture toughness of the welds in tensile areas does not satisfy the minimum 
fracture toughness of the parent material for risk level 1 given on Figure X.1, the structure 
shall be treated as risk level 2.

Alternatively, a plastic method of analysis according to 7.5 may be used. 
7.2  
Sectional Properties 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 7.2] 
The sectional properties to be used for global analysis shall be calculated assuming one of: 
1) the specified sizes, or 
2) the specified sizes less the allowance for the loss of thickness in accordance with 4.5.6, 
or 
3) the measured sizes. 
 
NOTE 
The reduction due to corrosion (see 8.7) can be ignored in the global analysis.  
7.4  
Construction in stages 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 7.4]  
Where the actual construction sequence is known in the assessment of an existing bridge, 
this actual construction sequence shall be used in the analysis. 
Where the construction sequence is not known or is uncertain, a worst possible sequence 
shall be assumed which leads to maximum effects in the structural element being 
considered. For this purpose, the worst possible sequence shall be chosen from among a 
realistic set of possible construction sequences likely to have been considered at the time of 
construction. 
NOTE 1 
More than one possible sequence might be required for a bridge, each appropriate to 
different groups of structural elements. 
7.5  
Plastic methods of analysis 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 7.5]  
Where a plastic method is employed it shall take account of all parts of the structure which 
can participate in the global response and shall be able to follow the progressive 
development of plastic hinges (in parts which are essentially linear in configuration) and of 
yield lines.  
Plastic methods of analysis shall be in accordance with 7.2.4 in BS 5400-1.  
Where a plastic method of analysis is used, the following requirements shall be met: 
1) The steel materials shall satisfy the appropriate requirements of 6.3 and 6.4. 
2) The member cross sections shall satisfy the requirements of 9.3.8. 
3) The structure shall be assessed in addition for the serviceability limit state using an 
elastic method of analysis.

4) The assessment of supports, supporting structures, webs and connections shall be 
based on the most onerous of the load effects derived from plastic and elastic analysis 
respectively. Where a plastic method is used consideration shall be given to all adverse 
patterns of loading and potential failure mechanisms to determine those providing the 
least safety margins. 
5) Lateral restraint to plastic hinges shall be provided as required in 9.12.6. 
6) Slenderness of members shall satisfy the requirements of 9.7.6. 
 
NOTE 1 
Compact stocky beams designed by use of elastic methods of global analysis could have 
some reserve of strength which could usefully be taken into account by means of the use of 
plastic analysis for assessment at the ultimate limit state.

with CS 457. 
8.3  
Distortion and warping stresses in box girders 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 8.3] 
Where the stiffness of a crossframe or diaphragm does not comply with the requirements of 
Annex B, distortional and warping stresses shall be calculated for 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.3.2 by 
analysis using a Finite Element plate model of the box girder and its diaphragms.  
The Finite Element plate model for calculating distortional and warping stresses shall be of 
sufficient extent to ensure that the effects calculated are insensitive to the end conditions 
assumed. 
8.5  
Imperfections 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at start of clause 8.5] 
Measurements of imperfections shall be carried out as necessary in accordance with Annex 
I. 
In deciding on the criticality of components with strengths influenced by imperfections in 
accordance with Annex I, a preliminary assessment should be made of the differences 
between predicted strengths using values of imperfections of one half and twice the 
tolerances given in BS 5400-6.  
Where the adequacy of any component depends on its actual imperfections or that 
preliminary inspection has indicated relatively large imperfections, accurate surveys should 
be carried out where possible in accordance with Annex I.  
Measures shall be taken to determine the accuracy of the surveys.  
The level of inaccuracy of the surveys shall be reviewed and an appropriate allowance made 
for the values used in subsequent assessment. 
Where surveys are impractical the worst credible values of imperfections should be 
assumed, making use of remote visual observations or experience with other similar 
structures or any other available information. 
NOTE 1 
The assessment additions provide a basis for allowing for measured geometric imperfections 
in calculating load effects and strength. The need to survey the actual imperfections depends 
on the sensitivity of strength predictions to the magnitude of imperfection and on the potential 
benefits of reducing allowance. The sensitivity to imperfections depends on the structural 
configuration, particularly in relation to slenderness parameters.

8.5.1  
Imperfections allowed for 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 8.5.1] 
Where bridges do not comply with the specification requirements of BS 5400-6 and BS 5400-
9, the assessment shall use values of imperfection for bearing misalignment, errors in level, 
bearing inclination and imperfections in flatness and straightness that are determined by 
inspections and as described in Annex I.  
Where measured imperfections of a structural element are greater than the BS5400 
tolerances and explicit provision is not made in the assessment additions to include 
measured imperfection, the strength and stiffness of that element shall be assumed to be 
zero.  
Where measured imperfections are less than the BS5400 tolerances, the benefit from 
reduced imperfections may be taken into account or the design strengths given in BS 5400-3 
may be used.  
Where imperfections are to be taken into account in assessment, they shall be assumed to 
be 1.2 times the measured imperfections to allow for inaccuracies of measurement.  
NOTE 1 
This factor of 1.2 is embodied into the relevant assessment additions, and could only be 
varied with the approval of the Overseeing Organisation where the nature and accuracy of 
the survey so warrants. 
8.5.2.1  
Torsionally stiff girders 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 8.5.2.1] 
For assessment the imperfections in common planarity of bearings shall be assumed to be 
1.2 times the tolerances specified for the bridge or 1.2 times the imperfections recorded in 
as-built information.  
Where specified tolerances or as-built information for common planarity is absent, 
imperfections shall be measured during preliminary inspections as described in Annex I and 
adopted in analysis of load effects. 
8.5.2.2  
Columns 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 8.5.2.2]

Members should be examined for presence of sharp notches, evidence of cracking, or 
curvature beyond twice the material thickness. For compression elements the remaining 
effectiveness of the section should be determined. 
Where there is evidence of differential settlement having occurred then monitoring of such 
movements should take place over a period of time to determine the rate of settlement or 
whether seasonal movements are involved. 
NOTE 1 
Guidance on other defects is given in the Inspection Manual for Highway Structures 
(reference 8.5.1). In particular for steel bridges these defects could include:  
1) Local damage to members, such as distortion of beam flanges due to accidental impact.  
2) Differential settlement, which might be evident by observations of:  
a. 
deformation of cracking in finishes;  
b. 
tilting of supports;  
c. 
departures from even road profiles.  
Where as-built levels are available from the time of construction, the settlement shall be 
based on movement from the as-built profile to the current profile. 
NOTE 2 
It is assumed that the steelwork would have been adjusted during its erection (e.g. at the site 
splices as is usual practice) to suit any discrepancies of support levels. In this case the 
effects of such apparent differential settlement would not be present.  
Where no as-built levels are available, the specified levels should be used instead. 
8.7  
Variations in structural dimensions 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 8.7] 
Measured section sizes shall be determined according to Annex I and used in assessment of 
strength of all critical sections.  
Due account shall be taken of any existing losses of section due to corrosion.  
Where it is impossible or impracticable to measure the actual dimensions of sound steel 
remaining in a corroded section (e.g. in unpainted non-corrosion resistance steel), an 
estimate should be made based on the original nominal dimensions minus a loss derived 
from an assumed rate of corrosion.  
Where remedial action to reinforce the damaged part and to reliably protect it is not taken, 
allowance shall be made in the strength assessment for existing and future losses . 
In the absence of other information the annual rates of corrosion at any surface of a section 
may be assumed to be equal to the extra thicknesses required under 4.5.5.1 divided by 240.  
NOTE 1 
Attention is drawn to the possibility that deep pitting corrosion can reduce not only the static 
strength of an element, but also its toughness and fatigue life. 
 
NOTE 2 
Section sizes for analysis in 7.2 can be based on specified or measured sizes, i.e. with or 
without corrosion loss.

Serviceability limit state 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.2.3.1] 
NOTE 2  
Studies have shown that the limiting value of 𝜓 can be typically less than 0.77(𝜎𝑚𝑎𝑥 > 1.30 
𝜎𝑎𝑣), for which the SLS check governs. This is more likely to occur in cases where 𝛾 factors 
at ULS are reduced or where dead load effects are relatively high in proportion to live load 
effects. Both of these aspects can be common in assessment, e.g.:  
1) Reduced surfacing and other superimposed load factors might be used for Assessment.  
2) Reduced live load might be used for structures with a reduced load rating.  
3) Other factors might be derived as part of the assessment procedure, e.g. material factors. 
NOTE 3 
The typical value referred to above is equivalent to:  
𝛾𝑓3𝛾𝑚𝛾𝑓𝐿 =  1.1 ×  1.05 ×  1.125

Non-complying outstands in compression shall be assessed according to 9.3.1. 
NOTE 1  
Although a limit is desirable for new structures to assist in avoiding wide outstands which 
may be prone to welding distortion by fabrication and to accidental damage, there appears to 
be no reason to downgrade strength if such limit is exceeded for assessment. It appears 
unlikely that the limit will actually be exceeded because of its historical use.

9.3.4.3 
Combinations of closed and open stiffener 
Where stiffeners are composed of a combination of closed and open sections, the 
proportions of individual components shall meet the requirements of 9.3.4.1 or 9.3.4.2 as 
appropriate. 
Where an element is not connected directly to the parent plate, benefit shall not be assumed 
from the restraining effect of the parent plate when using Annex S or any other method. 
NOTE 1 
This is intended to cover, for example, the case of “wine-glass” stiffeners (see Figure 1A). In 
this case the tee portion is not connected directly to the plate and hence no advantage can 
be taken of the restraining influence of the plate. This means that the option to use Figure

NOTE 1 
Generally the rules in BS EN 1993-1-1 are less severe for Class 1 sections than the rules for 
compact sections in BS 5400-3. The one exception is for webs primarily in compression, but 
with the neutral axis within the depth of the web. As in plastic design, the stress blocks are 
rectangular rather than triangular, the web will be more prone to instability when the distance 
from the plastic neutral axis to the compression edge is fairly large. The rules quoted are 
always more stringent than those in BS EN 1993-1-1, and follow it for 𝑑1  ≤ 0.5 𝑑𝑤. For 
larger 𝑑1 there is a linear reduction until the whole web is in compression.  
 
For comparison, BS EN 1993-1-1 gives 29.3𝑡𝑤 for 𝑑1  ≤ 0.5 𝑑𝑤 falling off (not linearly) to 
26.85𝑡𝑤 for 𝑑1 = 𝑑𝑤. It is noted however, that BS EN 1993-1-1 defines the depth of the web 
differently from BS5400-3 and in consequence the Figures are not exactly comparable. The 
necessary correction has been made to allow for the fact that BS EN 1993-1-1 is based on a 
yield of 235 N/mm2 instead of 355 N/mm2.

Compression flanges 
For plastic sections the compression flanges shall comply with the provisions for compact

In all cases the BS EN 1993-1-1 rules for Class 1 sections are less severe than the BS 5400-

NOTE 4  
Angle sections used alone as beams are not covered by the above. The behaviour of angle 
sections is affected by the non-coincidence of the principal U-U and V-V axes. 
NOTE 5  
The 𝑘4 factor (taken on 0.9 for rolled sections and 1.0 for all other beams) is an 
approximation that is reasonably conservative for design and is a simplification of the factor u 
given in BS 5950 Annex B. The replacement factors that can be used for assessment can be 
less conservative for general cases of beams symmetrical about either of the main axes and 
can thus be of benefit in assessment. Similarly for rolled sections symmetrical about either of 
the main axes, the buckling parameter given in published tables can be used in lieu of 𝑘4. 
The expression given for composite beams has is based on a practical range of composite 
sections, and could have a significant benefit for assessment in some cases.

Effective section for longitudinal flange stiffeners 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.10.2.2] 
As an alternative to the requirements of this clause for design, stiffeners may be assessed 
using an alternative effective section to calculate longitudinal stress, 𝜎𝑎, in accordance with 
a), b) and c) below.  
NOTE 1 
Where these alternative methods are used to calculate longitudinal stress, 𝜎𝑎, the values of 
𝑘𝑙1, 𝑘𝑠1, 𝑘𝑙2 and 𝑘𝑠2 are calculated differently according to 9.10.2.3 and 9.10.3.3.2.  
NOTE 2  
The calculations are complicated by the differences between the secant stiffness (related to 
𝐾𝑐′) and the tangent stiffness (related to 𝐾𝑐′′) and the need for iterative calculations. The 
parameters are listed below in the sequence of calculation with the iteration steps described. 
Where 𝐾𝑐′ or 𝐾𝑐′′ are used for multiple flange panels in one cross section, the iterations are 
carried out for all the panels together. 
a) For checking against criterion (a) in 9.10.2.3 
𝜎𝑎 may be calculated using an effective section of the beam based on 𝐾𝑐= 𝐾𝑐′.  
where  
𝐾𝑐′ 
(step 1) is obtained by iteration from Figure 5a using parameters 𝜆 and 𝜎𝑎′/𝜎𝑦𝑒. 
For the first iteration, 𝐾𝑐′ can be guessed, or taken as 𝐾𝑐 from Figure 5.

NOTE 3  
The strength of a stiffener with a large outstand is commonly governed by compressive 
failure of the outstand (by 9.10.2.3). In such cases the coincident stress in the plate when 
yield occurs in the outstand is less than the average stress on the effective section. 
Consequently, the section properties to be used in assessing strength for outstand failure are 
based on plate effective width coefficients relating to a stress on the plate of 𝜎𝑎𝛾𝑚𝛾𝑓3. The 
effective width coefficients based on this stress are typically larger than the plate effective 
width coefficients that would otherwise be used (i.e. larger than 𝐾𝑐 relating to strength, from 
Figure 5).

The rules for calculation of the effective widths of flange given in 9.4.2.4 were derived so that 
the compressive strength of plate panel is given by 𝐾𝑐𝜎𝑦 × 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒. As a 
conservative simplification the axial tangent stiffness and secant stiffness of a panel are also 
taken as those corresponding to the same effective width. The plate strength effective widths 
apply to plates having residual stresses equal to 0.1𝜎𝑦.  
NOTE 7  
The effective width coefficients 𝐾𝑐′ and 𝐾𝑐′′are derived for plates unrestrained in-plane along 
their edges and are consequently conservative for restrained plates.

Strength of longitudinal flange stiffeners 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.10.2.3] 
Allowance may be made for orthotropic action of a stiffened flange with or without

Equation 9.10.2.3 
where 
𝜎𝑐𝑟1

is the modified critical buckling stress derived in accordance with Annex N.  
Where overall buckling under the complete stress field is considered in calculation of 𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′  for 
a multi-stiffened panel between its boundaries or between intermediate transverse stiffeners, 
𝑘𝑠1 and 𝑘𝑠2 may be taken as zero. 
𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′  shall be calculated according to Annex N. 
Where in accordance with 8.5 assessment is to be based on measured imperfections in 
straightness of stiffeners, l/625 in the equation for 𝛥 shall be replaced by 1.2|𝛥𝑠𝑥|𝑒𝑓𝑓.  
The parameter |𝛥𝑠𝑥|𝑒𝑓𝑓 shall be determined from the measurements in accordance with 
Annex J and be taken with a positive sign when applied in this clause. 
Where imperfections are measured and allowance is made for orthotropic action, values of 
𝛥𝑠𝑥 may be measured using the gauge length G according to Annex N. 
Where the longitudinal stress, 𝜎𝑎, is calculated using the secant modulus 𝐾𝑐′ instead of 𝐾𝑐, 
the radius of gyration of the effective section of the longitudinal stiffener, 𝑟𝑠𝑒, should be 
calculated from one of the following two methods: 
1) Using Equation 9.10.2.3a above, accounting for orthotropic action. 
2) According to 𝑟𝑠𝑒= √
𝐼𝑜𝑥
𝐴𝑠𝑒, where 𝐼𝑜𝑥 is the second moment of area of the effective section 
according to 9.10.2.2 with 𝐾𝑐 taken as the tangent modulus 𝐾𝑐′′ and 𝐴𝑠𝑒 is the area of the 
effective section according to 9.10.2.2 with 𝐾𝑐 taken as the secant modulus 𝐾𝑐′. 
 
NOTE 2 
The use of different moduli, 𝐾𝑐′ and 𝐾𝑐′′ in (2) above ensures that the elastic critical buckling is 
given with respect to the total load in the stiffener and based on a stiffness derived using the 
tangent modulus.

stress, the following shall apply:

NOTE 3  
There can be a benefit in allowing for the orthotropic action of a longitudinally stiffened panel 
and deriving 𝜆, for the determination of more favourable values of 𝑘𝑙 or 𝑘𝑠. Such benefit can 
prove particularly advantageous when a panel contains intermediate transverse stiffeners 
between cross-beams or diaphragms or when the transverse plate stiffeners are relatively 
high in comparison with that of the longitudinal stiffeners or when stiffeners have high 
torsional rigidity. The BS 5400-6 design rules do not apply to transversely stiffened panels in 
which the transverse stiffness is not stiff enough to prevent overall buckling. In such 
instances recourse can be made to the rules for calculating the critical buckling stresses for 
orthotropic plates given in Annex N. Those rules are derived from classical elastic buckling 
theory and may be used to calculate stress levels to cause overall buckling of a panel 
between rigid boundary or buckling between intermediate transverse stiffeners, the lowest of 
which will govern the appraisal strength.  
In the context of these rules the boundaries of the panels are taken as being at webs, plated 
diaphragms or other transverse members satisfying the requirements of 9.15.3.  
The tolerance on initial bow of stiffeners in BS 5400-6 is l/750 and the rules of BS5400-3 
allow for 1.2 times that tolerance.

Curtailment of longitudinal flange stiffeners

point, due account of this shall be taken in application of the foregoing clauses.  
The arrangement shall always be checked to ensure the extension beyond any assumed cut 
off point is sufficient to develop the assessment loads in the stiffener.  
The assessment procedure shall take due account of the actual end of the stiffener in 
deriving the capacity of the arrangement, by working back to the cut-off point where the 
stiffener can be assumed to be effective.  
The resulting extension of the stiffener beyond the assumed cut-off point shall be ignored for 
calculating stresses and other strength checks. 
9.11.4.3.1 General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.11.4.3.1]

Where the out-of-flatness of the plate panels is less than the tolerance in BS 5400-6, a 
beneficial allowance may be made for this in the assessment of strength.

General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.11.5.2] 
Where in assessment of the adequacy of a longitudinal web stiffener allowance is to be 
made for initial departures from straightness, the parameters 𝜎𝑙𝑠 and 𝑘𝑠 shall be calculated

𝛥𝑠𝑥 
is the initial departure from straightness measured in accordance with BS 5400-
6 over a gauge length taken as a. 𝛥𝑠𝑥 is taken as positive when the bowing is in 
the direction away from the extreme fibre under consideration 
The benefit of orthotropic action may be utilised by using the modification to 𝑟𝑠𝑒, 𝑘𝑠1 and 𝑘𝑠2 
in accordance with 9.10.2.3.  
Where the stresses (or stiffener properties) vary and orthotropic action is considered, checks 
shall be made for each stiffener using the stress field at the position of the stiffener. 
NOTE 2 
The strengths given in this clause for design are deemed to allow for initial out-of-
straightness equal to 1.2 times the tolerance in BS 5400-6, i.e. a/625, as well as the effects 
of residual stresses. 
 
The value of 𝜂 corresponding to an initial departure from straightness equal to 1.2Δ𝑠𝑥 is 
1.2 Δ𝑠𝑥𝑦𝑟𝑠𝑒2

Adjustment of the 𝜂 value is therefore made in the assessment addition to allow for 
differences between measured imperfections and the tolerance. The adjustment made allows 
for the empirical relationship between 𝜂 and 𝜆 used in Annex G.13 whereby 𝜂= 0 for 𝜆≤15.

the cross section. 
Discontinuous longitudinal stiffeners may be used in assessing the stability of the web under 
shear and/or compression, provided they are terminated not more than four times the web 
thickness from the transverse stiffeners.

where 
𝛥𝑓 
is the measured imperfection taken over a gauge length normally equal to the

NOTE 3 
Where the restraints at supports are not effectively rigid, the mode of buckling of the 
compression flange adjacent to supports will be such that the end supports will deflect in a 
direction opposite to that of the intermediate U-frames. For a given lateral deflection of an 
intermediate frame relative to the end support the absolute deflections of the intermediate 
frame will be reduced. The rule given for factoring 𝐹𝑅 has been derived for the case in which 
there are a number of intermediate frames within the critical buckling half-wave length. 
Where there are only one or two frames within that length, the rule becomes conservative but 
can still be applied.  
NOTE 4 
Where several half-waves occur in a span, the influence of end support flexibility on the 
forces 𝐹𝑅 in frames within half-wavelengths remote from the supports is slight.

Where structures are assessed using plastic methods of analysis in accordance with 7.5, 
lateral restraint shall be present at locations of all plastic hinges and satisfy the following: 
1) be within a distance along the member from the theoretical plastic hinge locations not 
exceeding half the depth of the member. 
2) be adequate to resist the lateral restraint force, in addition to any other lateral forces. 
NOTE 1 
The requirement for torsional restraint close to plastic hinge positions is consistent with BS 
EN 1993: Part 1.  BS EN 1993: Part 1 does not offer guidance in determining this force but a 
reasonable value, consistent with other treatment in BS EN 1993: Part 1, would be that 
obtained as follows: 
1) for each beam in which a plastic hinge is taken to be developed as a result of the applied 
loading, a lateral force is calculated as 1% of the value of the plastic moment capacity 
divided by the depth of the beam, then  
2) each (and all) of these lateral forces are applied to the restraint system at the level of the 
compression flange at the appropriate beam, together with any other applied lateral 
forces. Lateral forces are applied such as to induce the greatest effects in the bracing 
system. 
9.13 
Transverse web stiffeners other than supports 
9.13.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.13.1] 
For each case of the following: 
1) a transverse web stiffener is absent at the crossbeam connection to the web, or 
2) a transverse web stiffener is absent where a sloping flange changes direction, or 
3) a transverse web stiffener does not extend over the whole depth of the web, or 
4) a transverse web stiffener is not fitted closely to the flange at a point of application of a 
concentrated load to the flange, or 
5) cut outs in a transverse web stiffener are not properly connected to the longitudinal 
stiffener, 
then detailed analysis shall be carried out to cater for local effects in the areas concerned.  
The assessment may utilise the relevant aspects of 9.14.6 and 9.15.6. 
The adequacy of transverse web stiffeners for deep webs with longitudinal stiffeners may be 
assessed using the methods of 9.15.6 as an alternative to the requirements of 9.13.3 to 
9.13.6.  
Where a transverse web stiffener does not extend the full depth of the web (or is not 
provided), a conservative check may be made with 9.11 by assuming that the load that would 
otherwise be carried in the stiffener is applied to the web panel as a transverse stress, σ2. 
For this purpose the transverse stress σ2 may be determined by applying the load over a 
length of web equal to twice the connected length of the stiffener or cross beam.

Where a transverse web stiffener is missing or not full depth, assessment of the web may 
alternatively be carried out using finite element analysis that includes non-linear effects 
associated with web buckling and tension field action.

Finite element analysis can be particularly appropriate for the case of a cross beam of a box 
girder connected to a deep web other than at the position of a web transverse stiffener.

Advice given in Eurocode on structural modelling could be of assistance.  
Where the transverse web stiffener is stopped short of a flange and local loading is applied to 
the flange, the unstiffened part of the web shall be assessed for the effects of the applied 
load. 
The connections between the girder and the transverse web stiffeners should be adequate to 
resist an assumed shear equal to 2.5% of the axial force in the transverse web stiffener. For 
this purpose the load effects to be included in calculating the axial forces are given in clause

2) the bearing stiffener is not fitted closely to the flange; or 
3) cut outs are not properly connected to the longitudinal stiffener;  
then detailed analysis shall be carried out to cater for local effects in the areas concerned.  
Where bearing stiffeners are not provided in accordance with the above, the adequacy of the 
web under transverse loading shall be checked in accordance with 9.14.6. 
Where the end of a bearing stiffener is not fitted and there is evidence of more than a small 
gap, the welds or other connecting parts shall be assessed to carry the load rather than by 
contact at the end of the bearing stiffener. 
Where there is a gap and an inadequate weld (or no weld), a check shall be made in 
accordance with 9.14.6.

NOTE 1 
In welded construction, it can generally be presumed that bearing stiffeners are fitted as a 
matter of formal fabrication practice, with such fitting achieving good contact over the end of

deformation would occur if there is a small gap and that the bearing stress check of 9.14.4.2

A gap at the end of a bearing stiffener is considered small if the connecting parts have 
sufficient ductility for the gap to close without loss of strength. 
For riveted connections, the bearing area should include areas within the dispersal lines of 
the flange angles and stiffener cleat angles which are riveted to the flange. 
Where the end of a bearing stiffener has a cleated connection, one of the following shall be 
applied for assessment: 
1) a check of the cleated connection for adequacy; or 
2) a check of the web in accordance with 9.14.6.  
NOTE 3 
Riveted construction will normally not have fitted stiffeners. 
The connections between the girder and the bearing stiffeners should be designed for an 
assumed shear equal to 2.5% of the axial force in the bearing stiffener, with axial force 
calculated to include load effects in accordance with clause 9.14.3.1.

Eccentricity 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.14.3.3] 
Where error in positioning or any unevenness of seating on a flat bearing is measured, 
assessment shall take into account the following values of eccentricity in respect of (c) and 
(d) above:  
1) half the width of the flat bearing surface plus the measured error in positioning for flat 
topped rocker bearing in contact with flat bearing surface; or 
2) the measured error in positioning for radiused upper bearing resting on flat or radiused 
lower part or for flat upper bearing resting on radiused lower part.

NOTE 1  
The use of measured imperfections can give benefit where strength is initially assessed as 
insufficient. 
NOTE 2 
For assessment this clause includes a built-in factor on the measured imperfection of 1.2. 
When assessment is made using measured imperfections equal to the BS 5400-6 tolerance, 
this gives a slightly different result from BS 5400-3. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clauses 9.15.6 and 9.15.6.1] 
9.15.6 
Compression flange transverse members with insufficient stiffness to prevent overall 
buckling of the flange, or with insufficient strength 
9.15.6.1 
General 
Where the stiffness of the effective transverse member does not comply with 9.15.3, 
assessment shall be made by one of the following alternative methods which cater for overall 
buckling of flanges:  
1) a full analysis using a structural model, in accordance with 9.15.6.2, or 
2) an assessment for overall buckling of the flange based on calculated critical stress in 
accordance with Annex K. 
The methods in this section may also be used to assess transverse stiffeners with insufficient 
strength. 
The effective sections for the approaches 1 and 2 above shall be as set down in 9.15.2. 
The effects to be considered for the approaches 1 and 2 above shall be as set down in 
9.15.4. 
Further to the above, advantage may be taken of the reduced destabilising effects that can 
be obtained by using more exact stress proportions and distributions in the flange (e.g. shear 
lag).  
The assessment may also derive benefit from using measured imperfections.  
NOTE 1 
The criterion for stiffness of a transverse member on a compression flange in 9.15.3 is based 
on ensuring that the overall buckling mode for the flange is one in which the transverse 
members alternate up and down. Under certain circumstances (and particularly when the 
span of the transverse members is large compared with their spacing) this can be a very 
onerous and, indeed, unnecessary requirement.  
 
It is known that some compression flanges perform perfectly adequately without meeting the 
criterion of 9.15.3 and this can be shown by a detailed non-linear three-dimensional analysis.  
NOTE 2 
Some further guidance on the stability of transverse members is given in references 9.15.1 to 
9.15.4.  
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 9.15.6.2] 
9.15.6.2 
Structural model when a full analysis is utilised 
The model shall be in the form of a non-linear analysis that takes fully into account the 
stiffness of the orthotropic deck systems and the magnified stresses resulting from 
deformation of the cross girders due to combined actions of longitudinal deck stresses and 
imperfections of the cross girders.

Treatment of imperfections 
The structural model shall include imperfections of the flange as an initially deformed shape.  
Where measurements of the actual flange imperfection are not available, the relevant 
imperfection specified in Item 5 of Table 8 of BS 5400-6 may be used as a peak value. 
Where the imperfection is derived from a specified imperfection, the peak values shall be 
applied at the mid points of each span of the transverse member and at the cantilever tips, 
with a smooth curve between. Alternate spans of a particular transverse member shall be 
deformed up and down. 
Adjacent transverse members along the bridge shall be deformed up and down either 
alternately, or alternately in groups of two, three ... etc., whichever eventually gives the 
highest forces and moments. Consideration shall also be given to having an undeformed 
transverse member between the up and down groups. 
Measured imperfections may be used instead in the model, subject to a minimum of 3mm. 
This measured imperfection shall be increased by a factor of 1.2. 
Where the result of the analysis shows a deflected form at collapse radically different from 
the measured form, further analyses shall be made with the initial deformation conforming 
more closely to the final deflected pattern. 
NOTE 1 
The required multiplier of 1.2 when using actual deformations allows for minor departures of 
the deflected member from the mode of buckling and small variations which may cause 
overestimates of strength. This is consistent with various clauses in BS 5400-3 where the 
design imperfections is 1.2 times the specified maximum value. 
 
Computer program requirements 
The computer program shall be capable of analysing displacement in all six primary degrees 
of freedom (three linear, three rotational).  
The computer program shall take into account the effect on stiffness due to the change of 
geometry under load.  
Material behaviour 
Member material behaviour may be taken as linear elastic with no allowance for plasticity. 
Loading 
The compressive load in the flange shall be applied at the end and side boundaries of the 
model, as appropriate for the actual loading conditions. The transverse loads on the flange 
and transverse members shall be those defined in 9.15.4.1(a) to (f) insofar as they are not 
otherwise taken into account in the model.  
Loading between transverse members shall be applied directly at the appropriate position 
rather than distributed as described in 9.15.4.5.  
The loads should not be magnified by the destabilising factors i1 and i2. 
Extent of model  
The width of the model shall include at least one whole segment as defined in 9.15.3.1.

PAGE 66 of 174
======================================================================
65 
 
NOTE 2 
Where multiple segments of different spans are analysed together, benefit can occur for the 
long segments due to partial end fixity from the adjacent short segments. 
The number of transverse members to be included longitudinally shall extend to cover a 
minimum of two half wavelengths of buckling. For this purpose, the wavelength for overall 
buckling may be obtained either theoretically or by progressively lengthening the model to be 
used for analysis until the critical length is found.  
Idealisation 
The analysis model shall be constructed of either beam elements, shell elements or a 
mixture of both. 
NOTE 3 
It is generally sufficiently accurate to represent all elements of the flange by beams with their 
neutral axes in a common plane.  
NOTE 4 
In some cases (eg a flange with no longitudinal stiffeners) ‘equivalent’ beams can be used to 
represent the plate stiffness and area.  
The distribution of stiffness and area in the analysis model shall correspond to that of the 
flange being assessed.  
Where beam properties are used to represent stiffeners, an appropriate effective width of 
plating should be included in the effective stiffener section.  
The analysis model shall be subdivided into elements which are sufficiently short to 
represent the buckling behaviour accurately. 
NOTE 5 
This will to some extent be dependent on the program used – for example, if it is a simple 
iterative extension to a linear stiffness analysis, a much finer subdivision will be needed than 
if it includes stability functions.  
NOTE 6 
Accurate representation of the buckling behaviour requires the analysis model to reproduce 
accurately the internal forces, moments and displacements in the buckled shape of the 
flange. The number of elements required to do this depends on their capability to represent 
internal variation in forces, moments and displacements (e.g. linear or quadratic finite 
elements).  
 
Boundary conditions.  
The boundary conditions should be simple pinned supports with no moment continuity.  
Where moment continuity is used at supports, the analysis should consider a larger portion 
of the flange such that the effects of the support stiffness are insignificant 
NOTE 7 
The basic notes on the structural model in this clause are not considered as all 
encompassing, and each specific case demands individual attention.

Girder layout 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.16.2.1] 
Where cross frames do not comply with the requirements of this clause for design, 
assessment shall be made in accordance with 9.16.6. 
9.16.2.2 
Cross frames 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.16.2.2] 
Cross frames not complying with the limitations of this clause for design shall be assessed 
using analytical models that fully account for the plane direction of the frames and the 
interconnection between the frames and longitudinal members. 
The methods in this document may be applied to cross frames not complying with these 
limitations, with the exception of Annex B.  
9.16.3 
Load effects to be considered 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.16.3] 
The forces and stresses carried by a cross frame due to torsion shall be determined 
according to either: 
1) elastic analysis (see 9.16.4.2), or  
2) in accordance with Annex B.3.4, for boxes with web inclination and provided that the 
cross frames comply with 9.16.2.2. 
Where the webs of the box girder are inclined to the vertical, the assessment shall include 
the effects of any horizontal components of load induced in top and bottom transverse 
members. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 9.16.4.4] 
9.16.4.4 
Ring frame corners 
The strength of the connection between web transverse members and flange transverse 
members shall be adequate to transfer the forces and moments from one member to the 
other.  
The assessment shall account for how both shear and the forces in the flanges of the 
transverse member are transferred. 
NOTE 1 
At the corner of a box the junction of web and flange members is required to transfer 
moment, shear and axial forces. The magnitude of each of these components depends very 
much on the configuration of the cross section. For example, the moments at the bottom 
corner of a small rectangular box will be quite small whilst those at the top corner of a large 
trapezoidal box will be quite large. For the former a simple lapped connection can be 
adequate whilst for the latter a stiffened portal knee can be required. 
In determining the strength of the connection at corners of the box, the requirements of 
9.16.2.3 for corner stiffening shall apply.

NOTE 2 
The web and flange of the box generally act as flanges to the transverse members. At the 
corners of the box they can only be considered to do so if there is stiffening along the 
junction line. This is covered by the limitation in 9.16.2.3. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 9.16.6] 
9.16.6 
Cross frames not complying with limitations 
Where cross frames do not comply with the limitations defined in 9.16.2, the strengths of the 
components of the frames shall be determined from this document in accordance with the 
following requirements:  
1) Global analysis is undertaken in accordance with 7.1 and 7.2.  
2) The structure is analysed either by a finite element method with all its primary 
components modelled or an equivalent grillage provided that the elastic properties of the 
equivalent members are derived from finite element analysis of the box girders. 
Analysis to determine load effects from local loads and reactions including distortional effects 
shall be undertaken using a finite element method on a model of sufficient extent to ensure 
that the effects calculated are insensitive to assumed end conditions. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 9.16.7] 
9.16.7 
Cross girder stiffness 
Where distortional and warping stresses in the box girders are calculated in accordance with 
Annex B, the stiffness of a cross girder shall comply with the requirements of B.3.4. Where 
the stiffness requirements are not complied with, the stresses shall be derived in accordance 
with 8.3.

Stiffened diaphragms not complying with the limitations in 9.17.2 shall be assessed using the 
procedures in Annex L. 
NOTE 1 
For diaphragms not complying with 9.17.2, more refined analysis id required which is 
described in Annex L. 
9.17.6.7 
Buckling of Diaphragm Stiffeners 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 9.17.6.7] 
The benefit of orthotropic action may be utilised by using  the modification to 𝑟𝑠𝑒, 𝑘𝑠1  and 𝑘𝑠2 
given in 9.10.2.3. 
NOTE 1 
Due to the general presence of stresses in the direction of the diaphragm stiffener, 
transverse to the stiffener and the likely presence of significant shear stresses, sub-panel 
modes as well as overall buckling are important for the determination of 𝑟𝑠𝑒.

Assessment of compression members 
 
10.3.4 
Circular hollow sections 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.3.4] 
Non-complying sections may be assessed according to the criteria of 9.3.6. 
10.6.1.1 
Strength 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.6.1.1] 
Where in assessment of the adequacy of a compression member allowance is made for 
initial departures from straightness, 𝜎𝑐 shall be calculated from the Equation in G.16 with 𝜂 
taken from Equation 10.6.1.1: 
𝜂 
= 𝛼(𝜆−15) + (
𝜆−15
𝜆) [
(1.2𝛥𝑠−0.0012𝐺)𝑦
𝑟2
] 
Equation 10.6.1.1 
 
but not less than zero. 
where 
𝛼, 𝜆 
are as defined in G.16. 
𝑟, 𝑦 
are as defined in 10.6.1.1. 
𝛥𝑠 
is the initial departure from straightness measured in accordance with BS5400-
6 using gauge length G. 
𝐺 
is the gauge length for measurement equal to the clear length of the 
compression member. 
 
NOTE 2 
The curves given in Figure 37 are derived empirically by reference to test data and include 
allowances for the effects of residual welding and rolling stresses as well as accidental 
eccentricities and initial bows.  
NOTE 3 
Since they are applicable to members within the tolerances in straightness given in BS 5400-
6, it is justifiable to adjust the limiting compressive stresses when departures from 
straightness differ from the tolerances.  
The term β in the Perry formula is given by 𝛥𝑦/𝑟2 
NOTE 4 
The tolerance in BS 5400-6 is 𝛥𝑠=
𝐺
1000 and throughout the design rules allowance has been 
made for 1.2 times the tolerance.  
NOTE 5 
The modified 𝜂 equation consequently provides allowance for 1.2 times the difference 
between measured imperfections and tolerances with the same empirical reduction factor to 
allow for the plastic capacity of stocky members.

Strength 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.6.2.1] 
For assessment of the adequacy of a uniform member of I-section subject to combined 
bending and axial compression, the buckling criterion given in 9.9.4.2 shall be used instead 
of the criterion above.

Evaluation of stresses 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.7.2 part (c)] 
Where measured initial departures from straightness are used in assessment of a 
compression member with longitudinal stiffeners, Δ𝑖 shall be taken as: 
𝛥𝑖 
=  1.2 Δ𝑠, determined separately for the X-X and Y-Y axes. 
where  
Δ𝑠  
is the departure from straightness measured in accordance with BS 5400-6 
over a gauge length 𝐺 equal to the distance between points of restraint 
appropriate to the axis being considered.  
10.8 
Battened compression members 
10.8.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.1] 
Where the arrangements of the member do not comply with any of the above requirements, 
the strengths of the battens and of the battened member shall be assessed in accordance 
with 10.8.5.3 and 10.8.5.4 respectively.  
NOTE 1 
The rules for battened strut design stem from those in BS 153 which is based on the work of 
Koenigsberger (ref 10.8.1). The arrangements and proportions of the members defined are 
intended to be such that the member as a whole has a compressive strength of at least 80% 
of that of a corresponding member free from shear distortion of battens and of the individual 
components.  
NOTE 2 
Members having more flexible and widely spaced battens can be structurally adequate but 
allowance is made in their strength assessment for shear flexibility and buckling of battens 
and of individual components between them.  
NOTE 3 
The rules for assessment are based on the theory and experimental evidence forming the 
basis for the rules for design.  
10.8.2 
Radius of gyration of the member 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.2] 
Where the battened member does not comply with the requirements of 10.8.1, the radius of 
gyration of the member shall be taken as 𝛷0.5 times the actual radius of gyration where 𝛷0.5 
is as defined in Annex M.  
NOTE 1 
The reduction factor of 0.9 on radius of gyration given in 10.8.2 of BS 5400-3 allows only for 
the loss of full effectiveness due to battening of a member complying with design 
requirements. Provision is made in assessment for reduction factors for less effective 
arrangements. 
10.8.3 
Spacing of battens 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.3] 
Where the spacing of the battens exceed the limits derived from the above requirements, the 
strengths of the battened member shall be assessed in accordance with 10.8.5.4.

Length 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.4.1] 
Where the length of any batten is less than the criteria above, the strength of the battened 
member shall be assessed in accordance with 10.8.5.4. 
10.8.4.2 
Thickness 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.4.2] 
Where the thickness of any batten is less than that the criteria above, the adequacy of the 
batten shall be assessed in accordance with 10.8.5.3.  
NOTE 1 
The batten thickness defined in 10.8.4.2 of BS5400-3 is such that the battens so sized can 
be accepted without consideration of their buckling. Smaller thicknesses can be accepted in 
assessment provided that they are checked against buckling.  
10.8.5.1 
Arrangement of battens 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.8.5.1] 
Where the arrangement of battens does not comply with the recommendations above, the 
battened compression member shall be assessed in accordance with 10.8.5.4. 
10.8.5.2 
Loads and moments on battens 
 
[BS5400-3, Amend clause 10.8.5.2] 
For assessment, (a) and (b) shall be modified to read: 
(a)  a longitudinal shear force equal to 
𝐾𝑏𝑄𝑠
𝑛𝑏 
(b)  a bending moment, acting in the plane of the batten, equal to
𝐾𝑏𝑄𝑠

𝑙 
is the overall length of the battened member 
𝑥1, 𝑥2 
are the respective distances from one end of the member to points a distance 
s/2 either side of the centre line of the batten under consideration. 
 
NOTE 1 
The shearing forces and moments defined in 10.8.5.2 of BS5400-3 are those due to the 
effects of axial load on a deformed member, and are treated as constant irrespective of the 
location of the batten. The assessment values take account of the variation in slope from the 
nominal axis of a bowed member in relation to the initial imperfection implicitly assumed.

Inclination of lacing bars 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 10.9.2] 
Where a laced member has lacing bars not complying with the above limits to inclination, the 
critical buckling loads and strength of the whole member shall be determined as follows: 
The critical loads for buckling about the Y-Y or X-X axes respectively shall be taken as 𝑃𝐸𝑌
′  =
 𝛷𝑃𝐸𝑌 and 𝑃𝐸𝑋
′  =  𝛷𝑃𝐸𝑋 where 𝛷 shall be derived from Equation 10.9.2: 
𝛷= {1 + 𝜋2 𝐴𝑒𝑟2
𝑙2 [
1
𝐴𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑠𝑖𝑛2 𝜃]}
−1
 
Equation 10.9.2 
where 
𝐴𝑙 
is the total cross-sectional area of the lacing bars within a laced panel in the 
appropriate plane of the bracings. 
𝜃  
is the angle of inclination of the lacing bars to the axis of the member. 
𝑙 
is 𝑙𝑥 or 𝑙𝑦 as appropriate. 
𝑟 
is the radius of gyration of the laced member as a whole about the X-X and Y-Y 
axes as appropriate. 
𝐴𝑒 
is the effective area of the laced member determined in accordance with 10.5. 
𝑃𝐸𝑌, 𝑃𝐸𝑋 
are as defined in 10.8.5.2. 
The strength of the member as a whole shall be determined in accordance with 10.9.1 with 
the radius of gyration about the appropriate axis taken as 𝜑0.5 times the actual radius of 
gyration using the value of 𝜙 appropriate to the axis considered. 
NOTE 1 
The rules in BS5400-3 for design of laced compression members ensure that the buckling 
loads of the members as a whole are not diminished significantly as a result of shear 
flexibility in the planes of the bracings and that individual components do not fail prematurely. 
Where the bracing is inclined to the axis of a member at smaller angles or is relatively light, 
allowance needs to be made for shear flexibility in the assessment procedure.

Assessment of tension members 
 
11.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.1] 
This section shall be applied only to nominally straight members subjected to axial tension or 
subjected to combined tension and bending.  
Where members are subjected to compression in some loading scenarios and it cannot be 
shown that sufficient redundancy or alterative load path exists for such compression to be 
ignored, the members shall be assessed in accordance with 10. 
NOTE 1 
Where structures are designed to earlier standards such as BS 153, the assessment 
provisions (and the provisions of recent design codes) can often be used to demonstrate a 
much greater load carrying capacity. This is because earlier codes used a much larger factor 
of safety than the current codes and typically imposed a maximum slenderness for tension 
members. 
11.3.2 
Effective area 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.3.2]

or less than 1.0 
 
Note 
𝜎𝑦 and 𝜎𝑈𝐿𝑇 are the nominal yield stress and ultimate stress derived in accordance with 6.2 
and 6.3 respectively. 
 
NOTE 2 
The rules in BS4500-3 for tension members and connections together with the associated 
safety factors relate to materials which have specified ultimate tensile stresses which exceed 
their yield strengths by certain amounts depending on the grade of steel. The margins 
provided by BS 15 and BS 968 correspond to those for grades 43 and 50 steel in BS 4360. 
NOTE 3 
For steels of other qualities allowance is made for the ratio of ultimate/yield stress. The 
modifications to the factor 𝑘2 provide compatibility with a ratio of 1.1 for grade 50 steel and 
1.2 for grade 55 steel.

Pin connected members 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.3.5] 
Where this requirement is not met, it shall be ensured through additional checks that tearing 
will not occur beyond the pin hole. 
11.4 
Thickness at pin holes 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.4] 
Where this requirement is not complied with, it shall be ensured through additional checks 
that local buckling will not occur beyond the pin hole.

General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.6.1] 
Where battens have been incorporated to cater for lateral loading or vibration (or for erection 
and handling during construction), and the requirements of 11.6.2 to 11.6.7 are not complied 
with, the battens and their fixings shall be assessed to resist the effects of all loading to 
which they are subjected including wind.

General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.7.1] 
Where lacing has been incorporated to cater for lateral loading or vibration (or for erection 
and handling during construction), and the requirements of 11.7.2 to 11.7.5 are not complied 
with, the lacing bars and their fixings shall be assessed to resist the effects of all loading to 
which they are subjected including wind. 
11.8.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 11.8.1] 
Where the above requirements are not met, the perforated plate shall be assessed to resist 
the effects of all loading to which it is subjected including wind.

their fixings shall be assessed to resist the effects of all loading to which they are subjected 
including wind. 
NOTE 1 
Where any requirements are not complied with there is a potential for local effects to be 
significant. However, stability criteria are not applied and battens/lacings can be thinner and 
lighter than for compression members.

Assessment of trusses 
 
12.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 12.1] 
Where joints between members are formed using untensioned bolts or rivets in clearance 
holes such that any secondary bending developed can be relieved by joint movement, 
bending of members that is solely due to axial deformation of truss members may be ignored 
for fatigue and serviceability limit states in 12.2.2 and 12.2.3. 
NOTE 1 
BS 5400-3 permits deformation stresses to be ignored in the middle third of the length of 
compression members at the ultimate limit state, but other secondary stresses due to 
eccentricity and off joint loading are included. The assessment method permits that 
secondary stresses may be ignored altogether provided joints are formed using untensioned 
bolts or rivets in clearance holes because any developed secondary bending will be relieved 
by joint movement. As far as fatigue is concerned it is generally unlikely that this will govern 
highway bridges except where poor details were used. 
Vierendeel or other non-triangulated girders or frameworks may be assessed using the 
requirements of this section. In this case bending and other secondary effects shall be 
included in assessment of the joints and members. 
12.5.2 
Restraint to compression chord 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 12.5.2] 
Where assessment of an intermediate U-frame uses measured initial departures from 
straightness of the compression chord, the value of 𝐹𝑅 shall be calculated in accordance with 
9.12.2 with 𝑙𝑒 in accordance with 9.6.4.1.1.2 or 9.6.4.1.3 as appropriate and with the chord 
treated as a compression flange.

12.6.1 
Lateral bracing not providing adequate restraint 
Where any provisions of 12.6 are not met, such bracing shall either be: 
1) ignored and assumed to provide no restraint, or 
2) assumed to provide partial restraint, provided it can be justified using a rigorous non-
linear analysis of the complete system.  
12.7 
Curved members 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 12.7] 
Members not curved to a circular arc or not complying with any of the requirements (a) to (d), 
shall be assessed for the following effects instead of using (a) to (d) above: 
1) The forces and stresses according to 9.5.7 or the adequacy of flanges to resist the radial 
component of the flange force, and 
2) The effects of the change in neutral axis position due to curvature, and 
3) The buckling resistance of sections that do not satisfy the criteria for a compact section.

Assuming the axial force in the flange is distributed uniformly across the width, the line load 
radial force per unit width across the flange per unit length of the flange can be expressed 
as:

Detailing 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 12.8.2] 
Where gusset plates have severe changes in geometric shape such as the presence of 
sharp re-entrant cuts, the effect of stress concentrations shall be included to determine 
stress in the gusset plate. 
Where 𝑏𝑔/𝑡 exceeds the above limit then the gusset plates shall be checked for local 
buckling either by means of a detailed analysis or by means of reducing the yield stress 𝜎𝑦 
given in 12.8.1 to a value given by Equation 12.8.2.

If the limit on gusset plate thickness from BS5400-3 is exceeded, then gusset plates are 
assessed for instability. There is no guidance on this item in previous bridge codes, but 
exceedance is not often expected because the limit is similar to limits for proportions of 
bottom plates in earlier codes.

Assessment of connections 
14.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.1] 
For assessment the term ‘fastener’ shall apply also to the components of members such as 
screwed tie rods and turnbuckles. 
14.2.3 
Serviceability limit state 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.2.3] 
The criteria to prevent slip at connections under serviceability factored loading in accordance 
with 14.5.4.1.2 may be disregarded provided all of the following criteria are met: 
1) no distress is apparent at the joints;  
2) the connection strength is adequate for ultimate factored loading in accordance with 
14.5.4.1.1(b); 
3) fatigue endurance is adequate in accordance with 14.2.2 with the fasteners assumed to 
be black bolts; 
4) the calculated deflections due to bolt slip do not cause unserviceability.  
NOTE 1 
SLS criteria for assessment are described further in 4.2.2. 
Where there is evidence of loose rivets in riveted connections then the fatigue endurance of 
the joint shall also be checked in accordance with 14.2.2 by assuming the fasteners to be 
black bolts. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 14.3.3.3] 
14.3.3.3 
Assessment 
Elastic analysis in accordance with 14.3.3.1 shall be used for:  
1) checking of HSFG bolts under 14.2.3 to the serviceability limit state, and  
2) assessment of welds under 14.2.2 for fatigue endurance. 
Plastic analysis in accordance with 14.3.3.2 shall be used in all other cases.  
NOTE  
For the assessment of connections in beams at the ultimate limit state it can normally be 
assumed that all the bending is resisted by the flanges (along with any associated flange 
angles) and that shear only is resisted by the web, provided that this is compatible with the 
basis of the assessment of the member.  
NOTE 2 
Prior to 1949, practice is known to have been to design the flanges of girders to resist the 
bending, and the web to resist the shear, though one-eighth of the web plates could have 
been included in the estimated sectional area of each of the flanges if the web plates are 
efficiently covered to transmit the horizontal stresses. This means that girder web splices in 
pre-1949 bridges are likely to be found deficient if, as is now usual practice, the webs and 
splices are assumed to share in the bending resistance. However, except in the case of 
HSFG bolts which do not appear in pre-1949 bridges (except as replacements for rivets) 
14.3.3.2 permits “plastic analysis” which can be taken to mean flanges resist all of the 
bending and web splices resist only shear.

14.3.4 
Distribution of load to the connected members 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.3.4] 
Where any part of a member is connected so that the load is not distributed over its effective 
section, the load dispersion from the fastener shall be determined by detailed analysis or by 
assuming the load is dispersed from a fastener onto a connected part within an angle of ± 
45° from the direction of the force. 
14.3.5 
Connection of restraints to parts in compression 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.3.5] 
Where the connection cannot resist the forces in (a) and (b) above, the intermediate restraint 
shall be ignored or the system checked by making allowance for the maximum restraint that 
can be provided, in accordance with 9.6. 
14.3.6 
Prying force 
 
[BS5400-3, Replace existing clause 14.3.6 with] 
Where more than one line of bolts or rivets is present and in the absence of more detailed 
analysis or effective stiffening to reinforce the connection, only the inner line of fasteners 
adjacent to the web shall be assumed as effective in resisting the tensile load. 
The value of additional bolt force, 𝐻 due to prying shall be taken as the greater of 𝑃𝑡/10, 𝐻1 
and 𝐻2, taken according to Figure 45a, Equation 14.3.6a and Equation 14.3.6b.

NOTE 1 
More detailed expressions are provided for deriving values of prying force for assessment, 
since the minimum value given for design could be unsafe for some situations where the 
design arrangements are not met or unnecessarily excessive for other cases.  
NOTE 2 
The value of the prying force developed in the fasteners of a connection is dependent on a 
complex relationship between the bending stiffness of the flange and the axial stiffness of the 
fastener but generally for a given connection geometry, as the stiffness of the flange is 
reduced then the prying force increases.  
NOTE 3 
The requirement that a lower bound value for prying force of 10% of the applied tension in 
the fastener be considered is an attempt to limit any possible loss of preload due to yielding 
of the fastener under overload conditions. 
As a simplified alternative for initial assessment the additional bolt force, 𝐻 may be taken 
instead as the greater of 𝐻3 and 𝐻4 according to Equation 14.3.6c and Equation 14.3.6d.

NOTE 4 
It is unlikely that the effect of prying forces on tensile connections will have been considered 
in the design of existing bridges designed prior to [BS 5400-3]. Riveted structures generally 
avoided the use of fasteners in tension so the absence of prying treatment in previous codes 
is not likely to be serious for these cases.  
NOTE 5 
Further background data on prying action is given in references 14.3.2 to 14.3.5.

Where only one surface of the spliced part is provided with covers, bending effects due to 
eccentricity between the cover plate and the spliced part shall be included for calculation of 
stress in the connected parts except where stated otherwise below. 
These bending effects due to eccentricity may be ignored in the following situations: 
1) at ultimate limit state except for compression components that may be vulnerable to 
buckling, or

2) with the presence of surrounding or adjacent concrete or other solid infill that prevents 
bending, or  
3) with the presence of an element that prevents bending of either the parent material or the 
cover and provided that this element is within a distance of 12t from the furthest fastener, 
where t is the thickness of the parent material to which the cover plate is attached. 
NOTE 1 
Where single sided covers only are present, it is likely that use of the full eccentricity of the 
cover and spliced part will significantly reduce the assessed capacity because of the bending 
stress apparently created. Although the effect of eccentricity is important for single sided 
splices, the stresses can be much lower than adding the product of eccentricity and load as a 
moment in the cover. Tests have demonstrated, for example, that in some circumstances 
welded single sided covers can develop the full capacity of bulb flats.  
NOTE 2 
Where splices are in tension at ultimate load the bending stresses would tend to be 
redistributed as the joints distort, so requirements are given only for serviceability. 
For the calculation of bending effects due to eccentricity it may be assumed that the line of 
action of the axial force in the splice is located along the interface between the parent 
material and the cover.

Obsolete splicing methods 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.4.5]

Connections made with bolts, rivets or pins

14.5.1.3 
Staggered spacing 
Where bolts or rivets are staggered at equal intervals and the gauge is not greater than 
80mm, the maximum distance between centres of bolts or rivets, permitted by 14.5.1.2.2 and 
14.5.1.2.3, may be increased by 50%. 
NOTE 1 
The value of 80mm has been used for assessment since it is believed that existing bridges 
might have a gauge length of 3 inches, i.e. greater than the 75mm used in [BS5400-3], but 
for which no reduction is really needed. 
 
[BS5400-3, Add new clause 14.5.1.5] 
14.5.1.5 
Assessment of non-complying arrangements 
Where the spacing of fasteners does not comply with 14.5.1.1, 14.5.1.2, 14.5.1.3 or 14.5.1.4, 
the following shall apply: 
1) Where there is evidence of plate bulging, distortion near or to fasteners or excessive rust 
forming, allowance shall be made for the reduction in strength.  
2) Where the spacing between fasteners is less than 2.5d, the friction capacity shall be 
reduced in linear proportion from a value of 100% of the normal capacity at 2.5d to 80% 
of the normal capacity at 2.0d. Where the spacing is less than 2.0d, the friction capacity 
of one fastener shall be ignored. 
3) Where the spacing between two fasteners away from an edge is less than 2.5 times the 
diameter of the shank of the bolt or rivet, the strength of each shall be reduced in linear 
proportion to a value of zero when the spacing is 1.5 times the shank diameter. Where a 
fastener is close to more than one other, the reduction factors shall be multiplied together 
4) Where the maximum pitch requirements in 14.5.1.2 are exceeded and the parts joined 
are in tension or shear, the connections shall be examined carefully to determine whether 
any corrosion has occurred. In the absence of evidence for such corrosion, a reduction of 
strength shall not be required.  
NOTE 1 
The maximum pitch requirements in [BS5400-3] are intended to avoid corrosion by ensuring 
that the plates are kept sufficiently close together for the paint film to be able to seal any 
gaps between the plates. 
NOTE 2 
Away from edges, this examination might be limited to any signs of corrosion around bolt 
heads or nuts, or bulging of plates. 
5) Where the parts joined are in compression and the limits that are given as a multiple of t 
are exceeded, a reduced yield stress of the outer plies shall be used, with the reducing 
factor, 𝑘𝑟, taken from Equation 15.5.1.5a. Where the limits are exceeded in two 
directions, the lesser value of the reducing factor in the two directions shall be used.

NOTE 3 
Where the plates are in compression, the requirements for spacing given as a multiple of t 
are intended also to prevent local buckling of the plates. 
6) Where the parts joined are in compression and the  limits quoted as absolute dimensions 
are exceeded, the connections shall be examined carefully to determine whether any 
corrosion has occurred.  
7) Where spacing is staggered, the same approach as in (1) to (6) above may be used. 
8) A similar approach to (5) above may be used in cases of non-compliance with 14.5.1.4. 
However, in this case the reducing factor, 𝑘𝑟, for yield stress, to be applied to the plate or

Edge and end distance 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.2] 
Where for assessment purposes any of the above limits for design are not complied with, the 
strength of the fastener or plate shall be reduced as follows:  
1) Where a fastener is adjacent to an edge that is parallel to the direction of force, the value 
of 𝑘2 in 14.5.3.6 shall be linearly reduced from the value 2.5 when the edge distance is 
1.2𝑑 to a value of zero when the edge distance is 0.8𝑑.  
2) Where the end distance of a fastener at the end of a plate is not less than 0.8𝑑 and the 
load is applied from the fastener to the plate in a direction away from the plate edge, no 
reduction shall be required due to end distance. Fasteners closer than 0.8 to the end of 
the plate shall be ignored.  
3) Where a fastener is adjacent to the end of a plate and the load is applied from the 
fastener to the plate in a direction towards the plate edge, the value of 𝑘2 in 14.5.3.6 shall 
be reduced linearly from the value of 1.2 when the edge distance is 1.2𝑑 to a value of 
zero when the edge distance is 0.9𝑑.  
4) Where the edge distance is less than 1.5𝑑, the friction capacity shall be reduced linearly 
to a value of zero when the distance is 1.0𝑑. 
5) Where strengths are mutually affected by more than one limit, the resulting reduction 
factors shall be multiplied together.

NOTE 1 
For rivets tests have shown that the actual strength capacity often exceeds that shown by 
calculations. Consequently testing of connections could show greater strength than that 
specified in the standards. 
Where black bolts have been used in permanent main structural connections, their 
assessment shall include a fatigue check. 
NOTE 2 
Fatigue check of black bolts is generally as Class G detail.  
Bolts shall be assumed to be black bolts and rivets shall be assumed to be hand driven 
unless there is evidence to the contrary. 
As an alternative, the requirements in BS EN 1993-1-8 together with the partial factors for 
materials in BS EN 1993-1-8 may be used to determine the strength capacity. 
NOTE 3 
Capacity from BS EN 1993-1-8 is based on the ultimate strength of the bolts or rivets rather 
than the yield stress.  
The diameter of the hole shall be taken as given on record drawings.  
Where the hole diameter is not known, it may be taken as a normal clearance hole of 2mm 
greater than the bolt diameter for bolts smaller than 27mm and 3mm greater than bolt 
diameter for bolts of 27mm and over. 
For structures to imperial units, reference should be made to contemporary standards for the 
limiting sizes of holes.  
NOTE 4 
Typically, clearance holes were taken to be 1/16"(1.6 mm) larger than the bolt; rivets were 
driven in holes 1/16" (1.6 mm) greater than their nominal diameters.  
Where there is reason to suggest that the holes are oversize, this shall be investigated or a 
suitable allowance made.  
NOTE 5 
To determine the actual diameter, d, of the holes in individual plies, and whether holes have 
been reamed, it can be necessary sometimes to remove sample bolts. 
Where the bolt holes are larger than clearance holes, the capacity of the connection shall be 
taken as a lower bound capacity which is calculated to prevent excessive deformation or 
premature failure of individual bolts.   
For the application of 14.5.3.1, all connections that are subjected to live or wind load effects 
shall be considered to be “permanent main structural connections”. 
Where HSFG bolts are used in connections with mixed bolts and rivets, the HSFG bolts 
should be considered only to act in friction at ULS, as the rivets cannot accommodate the slip 
necessary for clearance bolts to act in bearing/shear.

standards, values of tensile area and 𝜎𝑡 shall be taken from the relevant standard. 
Where the relevant manufacturing standard of bolts is not known, the tensile area may be 
taken as 60% of the shank area.

A worst credible value for 𝜎𝑡 of 230 N/mm2 can be presumed in most cases. 
Alternatively, tensile tests may be carried out on a statistically significant sample of bolts 
taken from the structure.

High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts specified to BS 4395-2 shall not be used to resist 
applied axial tension.

Rivets subjected to axial tension 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.3.3] 
Where there is significant loss of rivet heads, the tensile capacity shall be reduced. 
Where rivets are subject to tension due to live loads, 𝜎𝑓 shall be reduced to that for 
countersunk rivets, for which the remaining effective head diameter is not more than 1.3 
times the nominal diameter.  
Where rivets are subject to tension due to live loads and the remaining effective head 
diameter is less than 1.3 times the nominal diameter, 𝜎𝑓 shall be reduced to zero.  
Where the sizes of the rivet holes are not known, sample rivets of each head size and 
diameter shall be removed to determine the size of the hole.  
14.5.3.4 
Bolts subject to shear only 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.3.4] 
For bolts other than turned barrel bolts, the bolt shank area should only be taken as the 
shear area if it can be ensured from bolt dimensions on drawings or otherwise that the 
threaded length is clear of the shear planes.  
When checked for the shear capacity of HSFG bolts that are in accordance with BS 4395 
Parts 1 and 2 in accordance with 14.5.4.1.1 (b), the shear planes should be assumed to pass 
through the threaded length. 
NOTE 2 
For HSFG bolts in accordance with BS 4395 Parts 1 and 2, it would have been desirable at 
installation to have a reasonable thread length within the grip length of the bolt, as the major 
proportion of bolt extension takes place in this length. 
14.5.3.8 
Long grip rivets 
Where the grip length of a rivet exceeds eight times the diameter of the hole, the connection 
shall be inspected carefully for any signs of slip or separation at the interfaces.

14.5.4.1.1 Ultimate limit state 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.4.1.1] 
Friction group bolts of types, arrangements or tightness not in accordance with this or any of 
the following sub clauses shall be assessed by reference to 14.2 and published data relating 
to the bolt type or by tests on selected bolts in the structure.  
Where waisted shank bolts are used and evidence of slip indicates that the bolts are acting in 
bearing/shear, the following shall apply: 
1) each bolt should be inspected to confirm that it has not fractured, and  
2) the strength of the fastener shall be calculated as for a bolt in bearing/shear based on the 
waisted diameter. 
NOTE 1 
Normally only ULS is to be assessed and not SLS, but see assessment criteria given in 
14.2.3. In most cases the shear/bearing capacity will determine the strength of the fasteners.

Friction Capacity 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.4.2] 
Where bolts have been tightened in accordance with BS 4604 and the condition of the 
friction surface during installation is known with confidence and there is no evidence of 
contamination,  
1) the partial factor 𝛾𝑚 shall be taken as 1.30 at the ultimate limit state and 1.20 at the 
serviceability limit state, and  
2) 𝜇 may be taken as given in 14.5.4.4. 
Where circumstances are different from the above, the following shall apply: 
1) determine appropriate partial factors and 𝜇 factors by taking into account the probable 
prestress in the bolts and the condition of the friction surfaces.  
2) determine values for 𝛾𝑚 based on the methods given in 4.3.3. 
3) Where the condition of the friction surface is unknown and it is impracticable to remove 
any cover for inspection, use a value of not greater than 𝜇= 0.10. 
NOTE 1 
For blasting carried out in accordance with the Specification for road and bridge works (1976 
Edition), 1st quality to BS 4232 would have been required, for which a value of 𝜇= 0.5 is 
appropriate. The value of 𝜇= 0.45 was recommended for other qualities of blast cleaned 
surfaces to BS 4232 (by BA19/85 - withdrawn). 
NOTE 2 
Departmental Standard BD 7/81 (now CD 361) specified a 3rd quality blast cleaning to BS 
4232 for weathering steel, for which 𝜇= 0.45 was recommended.

14.5.4.5 
Oversized and slotted holes 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.5.4.5] 
Where the size of the holes is larger than the limits in the Table 12 or cannot be confidently 
taken to lie within the limits, the performance of the connection shall be assessed on an 
individual basis, paying particular attention to the likely condition of the interfaces and the 
consequences if slip were to occur.  
Alternatively, the capacity of all bolts in holes which do not comply with the limits may be 
taken as zero and the adequacy of the connection determined from the capacity of the 
remainder of the bolts.  
Where it is known or confidently believed that the size of the holes complies with Table 12, 
𝑘ℎ may be taken as 0.85 for over-sized and short slotted holes, or 0.70 for long slotted holes.  
Table 12 may be interpolated for use with imperial sizes and minor infringements arising from 
conversion ignored.  
The reduction factor 𝑘ℎ should be applied if the hole in any of the plies is greater than 
normal. 
Values of 𝑘ℎ shall not be extrapolated to less than those quoted above except after 
verification by testing. 
NOTE 1 
Where the clearance around HSFG bolts is greater than that in normal clearance holes, the 
potential movements if slip should occur is greater. There is also a greater risk of impact and 
consequent fracture of the stressed bolt if a sudden slip occurs. In such circumstances it is 
usual to specify a higher factor against slip and this is achieved by applying the reduction 
factor 𝑘ℎ to the calculated friction capacity.  
14.6 
Welded connections 
14.6.1 
General 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.6.1] 
Welded connections known to have been welded in accordance with BS EN 1011, BS 5400-
6, BS 5135: 1974 or BS 5135: 1984 may be assessed using the strengths in 14.6.2.3 for butt 
welds and in 14.6.3.11 for fillet welds.  
Welded connections not known to comply with the above standards may be assessed using 
the following alternative criteria for strength: 
1) Where butt welds are in compression the strength may be taken as defined in 14.6.2.3 
2) Where butt welds are in tension or shear and are free from surface cracks the strength 
may be taken as: 
a. 
equal to the strength as defined in 14.6.2.3, for welds complying with the re-
inspection criteria in Annex I, or  
b. 
85% of the strength defined in 14.6.2.3, for other cases. 
3) Where fillet welds are constructed to BS 153: Part 1: 1958 or BS 153: Part 1: 1972 and 
are free from surface cracks, the strengths may be taken as: 
a. 
equal to those derived from 14.6.3.11, for welds complying with the re-inspection 
criteria in Annex I, or

======================================================================
96 
 
b. 
90% of the strength derived from 14.6.3.11, for other cases. 
4) Where fillet welds are not in accordance with (3) but are free from visible surface cracks, 
the strengths may be calculated in accordance with 14.6.3.11, but replacing the term 
𝜎𝑊= 0.5(𝜎𝑦 +  455) by: 
a. 
𝜎𝑊= 0.5(𝜎𝑦 +  400), for welds complying with the re-inspection criteria in Annex 
I, or 
b. 
𝜎𝑊= 0.4(𝜎𝑦 +  400), for other cases. 
Where any of the general or specific requirements of this or any of the following sections are 
not met, due allowance shall be made in the assessment of the strength of welds. 
Crack like defects in critical tensile regions shall not be permitted. 
NOTE 1 
Welded connections in existing bridges can also be deficient in terms of their toughness 
properties, which cannot be measured in-situ by non-destructive testing. The requirements 
for toughness are given in 6.5. 
Where welds are not detailed in accordance with requirements of this document, any 
reduction of strength or fatigue implications should be taken into account.  
NOTE 2 
Examples of non-complying details might be: 
1) welds not detailed to BS 5135 or of yield stress less than that of parent material (14.6.1);  
2) intermittent or partial penetration butt welds (14.6.2);  
3) fillet welds with excessive gaps, incomplete end welds or returns, end connections with 
non-complying side fillets or overlaps and packings not trimmed flush (14.6.3);  
4) non-complying plug welds (14.6.4);  
5) welds with defects.  
NOTE 3 
Often it will not be known whether welds had been detailed to BS 5135, (ie with root face and 
gap dimensions as recommended), but this would not be detrimental provided appropriate 
procedural and production testing was undertaken at the time of construction. 
NOTE 4 
It can reasonably be argued that bridges constructed since 1974 (ie at publication of BS 
5135) will have been welded to BS 5135 such that their weld metal yield strength is at least 
equal to that of the parent metal, and that full penetration was likely to have been achieved in 
the butt welds where this was intended.  
NOTE 5 
The same are also likely to be true for bridges welded to the earlier standards BS 1856 and 
BS 2642. However at that time the sensitivity of equipment for non-destructive testing of 
welds was such that significant hidden defects could remain undetected, whereas visible 
defects would have been discovered and repaired. Except in cases where other evidence is 
available, it would therefore appear prudent to downgrade the strength of welds in bridges 
built prior to 1974 where hidden defects or lack of penetration could be significant, i.e. in butt 
welds.  
NOTE 6 
It is a fact that all welds contain defects of one sort or another, there being no such thing as a 
perfect weld. Many defects such as porosity and minor lack of penetration do not significantly 
affect strength. BS 153: 1972 allowed butt welds to be treated as parent metal. Permissible 
stresses in fillet welds were between 0.43𝜎𝑦 for Grade 43 to 0.37𝜎𝑦 for Grade 50. Allowing for 
the factor of safety of 1.7 in BS 153: 1972, the corresponding values from BS 5400-3 are 
0.43𝜎𝑦 for side fillets in Grade 43 and 0.35𝜎𝑦 for side fillets in Grade 50. It appears, therefore, 
that although BS 5135 was not available, the BS 5400-3 strengths were considered to be 
satisfactory in 1972.

NOTE 7 
The value of 𝛾𝑚 used at ultimate limit state in BS5400-3 for fillet weld strength is increased 
from 1.1 to 1.2 by BD 13/90. The value of 1.1 was based on the calibration of pre-1974 
results. The strengths of welds in bridges built before 1974 are therefore downgraded unless 
evidence is available that welds comply with modern standards. It is not easy to stipulate a 
value for 𝛾𝑚 to represent a downgrading because 𝛾𝑚 already varies depending upon the type 
of member. The simplest way is to reduce the yield stress of the weld metal. The measure of 
strength reduction due to the presence of weld defects is addressed by BS 7910 in detail, but 
a basis for assessment is to assume that the strength of the welds are downgraded by a 
maximum of 15% unless there is evidence that the weld complies with the re-assessment 
criteria in Annex I by results of n.d.t either at the time of construction or since. 
 
[BS5400-3, Delete existing clause 14.6.2.1 and replace with] 
14.6.2.1 
Intermittent butt welds 
For the assessment of intermittent butt welds, a length equal to three times the throat 
thickness at each end of any intermittent length shall be ignored in the calculation of 
strength. 
NOTE 1 
It is unlikely that the intermittent butt welds will exist often. The assessment provisions ignore 
a length at the weld ends because full penetration is difficult to achieve here. Arbitrarily it is 
proposed to deduct the contribution of the weld ends equal to approximately three times the 
throat thickness.  
 
14.6.2.2 
Partial penetration butt welds 
 
[BS5400-3, Add at end of clause 14.6.2.2] 
The strength of partial penetration butt welds shall be calculated as for fillet welds. 
For single sided joints where transverse bending causes tension across the root then the 
yield stress of the weld metal shall be taken as 50% of the weaker of the parts joined in 
assessing the resistance to transverse bending.  
NOTE 1 
BS5400-3 effectively bars the use of partial penetration butt welds under tensile stress and 
was drafted to avoid designs where cross bending is applied to single sided welds such that 
the root is operating at peak tension. However, in many cases partial penetration welds are 
provided as part of a two sided joint and cross bending does not put the root into peak 
tension.  
NOTE 2 
In assessment it is reasonable that partial penetration welds be treated as for fillet welds 
when they are not eccentric. Where single sided welds occur then the tensile stress in the 
root is limited arbitrarily by assuming that the yield stress of the weld metal is 50% of the 
strength of the weaker part joined. 
Partial penetration butt welds in non-fatigue prone connections may be assessed by 
reference to BS 5950.  
NOTE 3 
BS 5950 does not apply for eccentric welds carrying tension or compression. 
Where welds are not known to have been tested through procedure trials at the time of 
construction nor demonstrated by testing, the throat thickness of a partial penetration butt 
weld shall be taken as 90% of the nominal.

Outmoded forms of construction 
 
15.1 
General 
This section shall be used to assess the buckle plate, joggled stiffener and knee stiffener 
forms of construction.  
Any outmoded forms not covered within this section shall be assessed using the relevant 
section of this document where possible.  
NOTE 1 
In some cases additional studies, special analyses and tests could be beneficial to the type 
and form of outmoded construction encountered, to supplement the assessment checks 
carried out. 
15.2 
Buckle plates 
15.2.1 
General 
Buckle plates consisting of vertically curved steel plates with ballast or non-structural filling 
and spanning between supporting steel members shall be assessed by 15.2.2 or 15.2.3 as 
appropriate. 
NOTE 1  
Buckle plates are an outmoded form of construction in which curved or "buckled" steel (or 
wrought iron) plates span between supporting beams as shown in Figure 15.2. Buckle plates 
can either be arched (bowing upwards) or suspended (bowing downwards) and are normally 
riveted or bolted down to the supporting steelwork. It is noted by one reference that buckle 
plates were unsuitable for supporting block pavement under concentrated moving loads. 
 
 
Figure 15.2 – Buckle plates 
 
NOTE 2 
There appears to be little published information or methods of design for buckle plates. 
However some capacities are provided by the 1920 “Arrol’s Bridge & Structural Engineer’s 
Handbook” from experiments with arched wrought iron plates 0.91m square and with 50mm 
rise (see ref 15.2.1). Comparison of these capacities with notional calculations based on 
various design approaches are shown in Table 15.2. The capacities calculated for 
comparison assume a uniformly distributed loading and a “working stress” approach with 
mild steel at 165 N/mm2 bending stress.

Buckle plate 0.91m2, supported 4 sides. Table shows capacity for uniformly distributed

NOTE 3 
The comparisons in Table 15.2 show that buckled plates derive some benefit from arching 
action, but that full horizontal thrust capacity is probably not available. It is seen that a 
reasonable comparison is reached assuming that the plate when acting as an arch is 
analogous to a strut having an effective length equal to half the span. Clearly in practice the 
capacity depends on: 
1) Span, plate thickness and rise; 
2) Whether supported, or stiffened, on 2 or 4 sides; 
3) Form of filling, loose or solid; 
4) Resistance to thrust by connections and capacity of supporting members; 
5) Uniform or concentrated loading. 
NOTE 4 
In order to establish a fully reliable assessment method it would be necessary to undertake 
research by testing. The number of different forms of buckle plates means that this could be 
extensive. It is unwarranted compared with the number of bridges likely to be remaining in 
service carrying traffic loading on buckled plates, because often they occur beneath footways 
only. A simple and conservative approach is therefore proposed for checking the capacity of 
buckle plates typically encountered based on the available information given above and upon 
judgment. A simplified approach based on arch or catenary action is considered appropriate 
for spans up to 1.2m only, with rise between 1/12th and 1/18th of the span, where the plates 
are riveted or bolted down on at least 2 sides. In other cases and where the structure is 
limited by the thrust capacity of the fixings or supporting members, then a flat plate approach 
is used.  
15.2.2 
Spans of 1.2 m or less 
Where the clear span measured between edges of supporting members is 1.2 m or less and 
complies with the following: 
1) the rise is between 1/12th and 1/18th of the clear span, and 
2) the plate thickness is at least 6 mm,  
the strength may be assessed assuming arch or catenary action with the horizontal thrust

calculated is assumed to occupy the full area of the plate. 
𝐿  
is the span of buckle plate between edges of supporting members. 
𝑟

Where arching action is used, the capacity of the arch for horizontal thrust may be checked 
as a straight compression members in accordance with 10.6, with parameters taken instead 
to be the following when calculating the value of 𝜎𝑐: 
𝜂  
is the buckling parameter to be taken as 𝜂= [𝑎(𝜆−15)]. 
𝑙𝑒 
is the effective length, to be taken as extending from the end of the span to the 
intersection point with the wheel distribution, but not less than 0.5𝐿. 
NOTE 1 
This 𝜂 value is consistent with the BS5400-3 clause, i.e. without using measured 
imperfections. 
Where catenary action is used, the capacity for tension in the plate shall be checked as a 
tension member in accordance with clause 11.  
Where arch or catenary action is assumed, the fixings and the supporting members shall be 
capable of resisting the horizontal load.  
Alternatively to the methods above, the buckle plate may be checked as a flat plate without 
the effects of catenary or arch behaviour. 
15.2.3 
Spans of more than 1.2 m 
Domed buckle plates of spans greater than 1.2m shall be checked as flat plates unless 
testing or detailed analysis is carried out demonstrating greater capacity. 
Suspended buckle plates of spans greater than 1.2m may be checked as a flat plate or as a 
tension member according to the method in 15.2.2. 
15.3 
Joggled stiffeners 
15.3.1 
Assessment of joggled stiffeners 
The criteria for assessment of joggled stiffeners shall use the additional requirements of 
15.3.2 or 15.3.3 combined with the relevant sub-clauses of 9.13 or 9.14 as appropriate, to 
derive effective sections and loading and assess the strength.  
In addition, the limitations on shape shall be addressed in accordance with 9.3. 
NOTE 1 
Joggled stiffeners to beams are an outmoded form which occurs in riveted construction 
where the necessity to employ flange angles interrupted the web depth. This means that 
stiffeners are “joggled” to clear the vertical leg of the flange angles. The alternative was to 
insert packings between stiffener and web as practised when the stiffeners acted as bearing 
stiffeners. The different types are shown in Figure 15.3.

Figure 15.3 – Stiffener types in riveted construction 
NOTE 2 
Joggled or knee stiffeners ((i) & (iv) above) introduce a local eccentricity which could reduce 
their strength (although no experimental work is known) in carrying axial load, i.e. as a 
bearing stiffener, but much less likely to reduce their effectiveness as intermediate stiffeners. 
This had been appreciated in the drafting of old codes such that it is unlikely in practice that 
joggled or knee stiffeners will exist except as purely intermediate stiffeners.  
15.3.2 
Joggled stiffeners acting as transverse web stiffeners other than at supports 
Joggled or knee type transverse stiffeners shall be assessed as transverse web stiffeners.  
Where an axial force resulting from application of 9.13.3.1 (c), (d), (e) and (f) is applied to 
joggled or knee type stiffeners other than within the straight portion between joggles, the 
additional bending stress introduced by the shape of the stiffener shall be included within the 
joggle height when checking yielding of the stiffener under 9.13.5.2. 
The additional bending stress shall be in accordance with 1 for joggled stiffeners and in 
accordance with 2 for knee stiffeners: 
1) For joggled stiffeners the bending stress shall be calculated assuming that a bending 
moment is applied to each stiffener leg equivalent to its axial load multiplied by an 
eccentricity equal to one half of the joggle offset.  
The joggle height over which the bending stress can be included shall be taken as at the 
level of the joggle and extending to the first fastener either side which connects the 
stiffener to the web. 
2) For knee stiffeners the bending stress shall be calculated assuming that a bending 
moment is applied to each stiffener leg equivalent to its axial load multiplied by an 
eccentricity equal to one half of the horizontal distance from the centroid of the stiffener to 
the point of intersection of its flange with the beam flange. 
The height, over which the bending stress is to be included, shall be taken as from the 
flange in contact with the stiffener to the first fastener where the stiffener is connected to 
the web. 
15.3.3 
Joggled stiffeners acting as load bearing support stiffeners 
Where joggled stiffeners or knee stiffeners occur as load bearing support, the additional 
bending stress introduced due to the shape of the stiffener shall be assessed when applying 
9.14.4.1. The additional bending stress may be calculated in accordance with 15.3.2.

NOTE  
Where stiffeners act as bearing stiffeners then either packed or gusseted stiffeners would 
appear to require no special assessment over existing BS 5400-3 requirements. Joggled or 
knee types deserve consideration, although it seems unlikely that many will exist because of 
the requirements of the old codes. 
Joggled gusseted stiffeners and knee gusseted stiffeners can be assessed more easily by 
ignoring the joggled region from assessment.

Bearing types within scope of BS 5400-9 shall be assessed to BS 5400-9.  
Steel bearings of types outside the scope of BS 5400-9 shall be assessed using BS 5400-3 
(as implemented by this document).  
Bearings may alternatively be assessed to BS EN 1337 where applicable. 
Where movement of a bearing is impaired or restricted, then load effects shall be included in 
the assessment in accordance with CS 454.   
NOTE 1 
The transfer of horizontal loadings, especially longitudinal forces, can also be uncertain. As 
far as temperature restraint effects are concerned it is likely that structure will be showing 
signs of distress, such as by local spalling of masonry, where temperature effects have been 
relieved. The specific assessment of inbuilt temperature effects is therefore considered of 
secondary importance because it is mainly a question of unserviceability. 
16.2 
Beams without bearings 
Where beams do not have discrete bearings and bear directly on concrete, brickwork, or 
masonry substructures with or without a bearing plate or other distributive layer, then the 
local distribution of load to the substructure shall be assessed taking due account of any 
rotation or movement.  
Patch loading to the web of the beam shall be assessed in accordance with 9.9.6 where 
appropriate. 
16.3 
Pressure distribution under bearing areas 
Where the end of a beam bears directly on a substructure without bearings a linear pressure 
distribution shall be assumed varying from a maximum at the inner face of the contact area 
down to zero at the far face or free end of the girder.  
The assumed length of the contact area shall not exceed the length of girder in contact, or 
the depth of the beam if less.  
For distribution transversely or in other directions as appropriate, a dispersal angle of 2 
horizontal to 1 vertical shall be assumed through any flange angles, flange plate(s) and 
bearing plate (s) present onto the surface of concrete, brickwork, masonry or other material 
of the substructure.  
NOTE 1 
This assumption follows that in BS 153. 
The effective span of the beam shall be assumed to extend from the centroid of the contact 
area determined. 
NOTE 2 
The dispersal angle and the extent of effective span are illustrated in Figure 16.3.

16.4 
Maximum pressures under bearing areas 
For concrete substructures the compressive stress in the contact area shall not exceed the 
allowable limits given by CS 455.  
For masonry bed stones the bearing stresses shall not exceed 0.4 𝑓𝑐𝑢, with 𝑓𝑐𝑢 being the 
characteristic compressive strength of the masonry. Where inspection has shown evidence 
of no local spalling, no cracking and no other distress, this value may be increased to 0.6 𝑓𝑐𝑢.  
The compressive strength of the masonry should be derived by testing where possible. 
Failing this, published information of guidance on strengths of different materials quoted in 
CS 454 should be used. 
Bearing loads shall be assumed to disperse at an angle of 1:1 through masonry bed stones 
down to supporting coursed masonry or brickwork.

[BS5400-3, Add new Annex H] 
Annex H - Derivation of nominal yield stress for assessment 
H.1 
General 
The nominal yield stress, 𝜎𝑦, for use in the assessment of existing bridges shall be derived 
using one of the methods from this Annex. Although written in terms of yield stress some 
methods may also be used to assess ultimate tensile stress. 
NOTE 1 
The choice of methods given in Annex H for deriving the assessment yield stress depend on 
the extent of knowledge of the origin and properties of the steel used in a structure. Some 
methods can also offer advantages for recent structures when there are several relevant 
mills’ test certificates showing a mean strength substantially greater than the specified 
minimum. 
H.2 
Yield stress based on specifications 
The nominal yield stress may be determined depending on the specification of the steel from 
construction using Table H.2.

steel from construction

value specified in the relevant Standard. 
BS 15, BS 548, BS 968 or 
BS 2762 and thickness up 
to 63mm 
the nominal yield stress may be taken as the 
minimum value specified in the relevant Standard 
for material appropriate to the thickness of 16mm 
irrespective of the actual thickness of the 
component. 
Material quality specified 
is not known and no test 
information is obtained 
the steel may be assumed to be a mild steel 
grade with specified minimum yield stress in BS 
15 or BS 4360 appropriate to the date of 
construction provided that the steel can be 
identified, by means of trade marks or names, as 
being made by a recognised supplier. 
In all cases the material standard referred to should be that current at the date of fabrication.  
H.3 
Yield stress based on tests of the material in the component to be assessed 
For the nominal yield stress to be taken as the measured value without adjustment, the 
tensile testing shall be in accordance with BS 4360 and using a sample from the particular 
component to be assessed. 
These samples should be taken at the locations within the cross section defined in BS 4360.

H.4 
Yield stress based on mill test certificates or tests on samples 
H.4.1 
Yield stress based on mill test certificates or tests on samples taken from existing 
structures composed of BS EN 10025, BS 4360, BS 15, BS 548, BS 968 or BS 2762 
steel 
Where the nominal yield stress for assessment is derived from test results using this clause, 
the following shall all apply: 
1) mill test certificates for the material used are available or tests are undertaken on the 
materials for representative parts, and 
2) the materials were specified to one of BS EN 10025, BS 4360, BS 15, BS 548, BS 968 or 
BS 2762 
Where mill test certificates are available which can be identified as applying to the cast 
number and product type of the component being assessed but not necessarily to a 
particular batch from which the component was rolled, the nominal yield stress of that 
component may be taken as the greatest of the values from H.2 above and from Equations 
H.4.1a and H.4.1b. 
Where the results of tests in accordance with BS 4360 on samples taken from components 
of the same profile and the same structure as the part to be assessed are obtained, the 
nominal yield stress of that component may similarly be taken as the greatest of the values 
from H.2 above and from Equations H.4.1a and H.4.1b.

2 
Equation H.4.1b 
where  
𝜎𝑦𝑚 
is the mean of the yield stresses on the relevant certificates or obtained from 
the tests. 
𝑛 
is the number of relevant certificates or test results. 
𝑠∗ 
is the standard deviation from 𝜎𝑦𝑚 of the relevant test results. 
𝑘 
is a statistical coefficient values of which are given in Table H.4 for various 
numbers, 𝑛, of relevant test results. 
 
NOTE 1 
The statistical Equation H.4.1a is based on the assumption that the coefficient of variation of 
yield stress of parts of the same product type is 6.4% from one case of modern UK structural 
steels, and is derived by use of a one-sided confidence interval calculation as described in 
BS 2846: Part 2: 1981, using a 95% confidence interval. However, owing to the uncertainties 
involved in assessing population statistics from small numbers of samples, the equation does 
not provide a benefit unless the mean yield stress is relatively high and/or many relevant test 
results are available. 
NOTE 2 
The Equation H.4.1b is based on that described in BS 2846: Part 3: 1975  Table 7 in which 
two alterations are made:  
1) a factor of 2/1.65 is introduced to allow for the overestimation of the static yield stress 
due to the high strain rates used in mill testing, and  
Downloaded from https://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk on 12-Nov-2025, CS 456, published: Mar-2020



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 174
======================================================================
109 
 
2) a reduction factor is introduced to apply when the variability in the yield stress exceeds 
that of current UK structural steels in order to avoid modification to the partial safety 
factors in 4.3. 
Where for Equation H.4.1b few results are available having a high coefficient of variation, the 
value of this coefficient of variation judged as the maximum credible may be used instead of 
the value from the tests.  
NOTE 3  
The Equation H.4.1b requires no prior knowledge of the coefficient of variation but can 
produce pessimistic values when few results are available having a high coefficient of 
variation.  
NOTE 4  
For the statistical analysis to be valid, the specimens tested are asked to be supplied from 
the same source as the component being assessed, and the tests are assumed to be 
undertaken on material from the same part of the cross section (e.g. flange when assessing 
flange strength) at the locations defined in BS 4360.  
Where a mill test certificate is available which is identified as applying to the same cast from 
which the component being assessed was rolled, or the result of a test on a sample taken 
from the component is obtained, the nominal yield stress may be taken from Equation 
H.4.1c: 
𝜎𝑦 
= 𝜎𝑦𝑡− 10 𝑁/𝑚𝑚2 
Equation H.4.1c 
 
where  
𝜎𝑦𝑡  
is the yield stress given on the certificate or obtained from the test in 𝑁/𝑚𝑚2. 
NOTE 5 
The greatest benefit can be expected to result from testing material taken from a critical 
component, but this is not always practical or desirable.

Where the steel material is not known to comply with BS EN 10025, BS 4360, BS 15, BS 
548, BS 968 or BS 2723, test results shall be used from samples taken from the components 
or similar components in the same structure to determine the yield stress and the nominal 
yield stress should be derived in accordance with Equation H.4.1b above.

In the absence of knowledge of the specification or test data related to the steel of a 
component, assumptions may be made as to the worst credible yield stress being the value 
judged to be the least that the actual yield stress would have.  
The worst credible yield stress should be taken as the steel of the weakest grade of 
structural steel in use at the time of construction.   
In this context the results of hardness testing (see 6.3) may be used to provide an estimate 
of the U.T.S. from which the grade of steel may be judged. 
Where worst credible values are used, the sensitivity of the strength of the structure to the 
yield stress of the component should be reviewed.

[BS5400-3, Add new Annex I] 
Annex I - Inspections for assessment 
I.1 
General 
Inspections for assessment shall comply with the aims and provisions of CS 454 and where 
possible with the recommendations given in this Annex. 
I.2 
Preliminary inspection and criticality ratings 
A preliminary inspection shall be undertaken with nature and extent appropriate to: 
1) the prior knowledge of the construction of the bridge, including as-built drawings, 
construction procedures, dimensional surveys and material property data; and 
2) the criticality of each part of the bridge in relation to its overall and local structural 
adequacy. 
A preliminary inspection should establish the following: 
1) In the absence of drawings or previous dimensional surveys of any part of the whole of a 
bridge, the layout dimensions and nominal component sizes should be recorded. Details 
of all accessible connections should be measured and the locations of any inaccessible 
parts or connections should be noted.  
2) Where design drawings but no as-built drawings or previous dimensional surveys are 
available, the layout dimensions should be checked against the design drawings and 
nominal component sizes used should be verified. Connections should be visually 
inspected for compliance with the drawings and any variation in location or arrangement 
noted. 
3) For bridges where the load effects are sensitive to errors in level inclination or common 
planarity of bearings and no as built records of these are available, the bearings should 
be surveyed and the errors recorded. 
4) Locations of significant visible damage, deterioration or cracking should be recorded. 
NOTE 
Where the information from 1-3 is given by as-built drawings and/or previous surveys are 
available, the purpose of preliminary inspection is only to determine condition. 
An initial assessment of the adequacy of the structure should be undertaken using the best 
information then available.  
The initial assessment should be used to establish the relative criticality of each part and to 
identify what further information is required to enable the final assessment to be undertaken.  
Where information is lacking (e.g. material properties, or constructional imperfections), 
pessimistic assumptions should be made for the initial assessment.  
Any parts assessed as likely to be inadequate or shown by the preliminary inspection to be 
significantly corroded or deteriorated should be identified on drawings and used for reference 
in the detailed inspection.

I.3  
Detailed inspections 
The detailed inspection of a bridge shall be carried out as necessary to supplement the 
information concerning the details and conditions obtained in the preliminary survey as set 
out in I.4 to I.6. 
NOTE 1 
Inspection requirements for sealed box members and hollow sections are given in 4.5.2. 
I.4  
Structural arrangements and sizes 
Measurements of components on the structure shall be appropriate to the level of the as-built 
information and the criticality of the elements. 
The section dimensions of components at critical locations should be measured. 
Dimensions of connections at critical locations and their connectors should be recorded, 
including weld sizes. 
NOTE 
Note that fillet welds larger than specified could be to compensate for a larger root gap which 
does not increase the throat thickness. 
I.5  
Constructional imperfections 
Measurements of construction imperfections shall be appropriate to the construction quality 
information and the criticality of the elements. 
All components should be visually inspected for gross deformations from intended flatness or 
straightness.  
Where a part is critical and the strength of the part is related to geometric imperfections, 
detailed measurement of deviations should be made in accordance with 5.6 of BS 5400-6 or 
as otherwise defined in this document. 
The alignments of all bearings in relation to load bearing stiffeners and/or diaphragms should 
be measured.  
The coincident ambient temperature of the main bridge members should be recorded during 
measurements of bearing alignment and appropriate adjustment made to the eccentricities or 
alignment to allow for the differences between the observed and the effective bridge 
temperature relative to the assessments required. 
I.6  
Condition 
I.6.1  
General 
At all locations where corrosion, deterioration and/or damage including missing components 
is apparent, its significance shall be assessed by reference to the criticality ratings, taking 
detailed measurements of loss of section and/or investigating potential influences on fatigue 
life or fracture propensity. 
I.6.2 
Welded connections 
All welds shall be checked for completeness and loss of section due to corrosion.

Welds in critical tensile areas shall be subject to 100% visual testing (VT) to confirm the 
minimum weld sizes and the absence of visible crack like defects.  
Critical tensile areas shall include all areas in tension for which damage tolerance is poor and 
failure can cause premature loss of strength. 
Visual testing of welds covered by paint which are not to be subject to other forms of NDT is 
acceptable provided the paint is less than 100 microns thick and provides a suitable contrast 
for inspection.  
Where there is any doubt as to the effectiveness of visual inspection over paint, the paint 
shall be removed and the weld VT repeated. 
In-line butt welds in critical regions that are underfilled or ground flush with reduced thickness 
shall be surveyed to measure the remaining thickness. 
Where any of the following situations apply to welded connections in critical tensile areas, the 
welded connections shall be inspected using the re-inspection criteria in I.8: 
1) where there is a lack of confidence that the workmanship meets the criteria for re-
inspection and materials meet the criteria of 6.5, or 
2) where the theoretical fatigue life is deficient or has been exceeded, or 
3) where defects are identified in the weld from visual testing 
4) where defects are suspected due to other reasons, for example if similar details 
elsewhere on the structure have known defects. 
The inspection criteria for welded connections subject to fatigue should be appropriate to the 
detail category assumed in the fatigue assessment.  
Where a transverse web stiffener is stopped short of a flange by more than five times the 
web thickness, inspection should pay particular attention for fatigue cracking.  
I.6.3 
Bolted and riveted connections 
The inspection of bolted and riveted connections shall be appropriate to the criticality, 
condition and the level of as-built information. 
All bolted and riveted connections should be inspected for loss or looseness of connectors. 
HSFG bolted connections should be tested for tightness by application of the appropriate 
torque to a representative sample of nuts. 
NOTE 1 
The purpose of applying a torque to existing High Strength Friction Grip Bolts is to check for 
tightness to ensure they were originally tightened substantially beyond the bedding torque 
and plastically strained.  
 
NOTE 2 
Testing for tightness using a torque wrench is needed even where load indicating washers 
have been used since these can be an unreliable indication of whether the correct tension 
has been achieved in the bolt. 
HSFG bolts with obvious signs of movement (e.g. paint cracking, slackness of fit) or 
considered suspect after light hammer tapping should be given more detailed examination 
and replaced if necessary. Re-tightening of HSFG bolts shall not be permitted. 
Rivets should be tested for tightness by hammer tapping.

======================================================================
114 
 
When a rivet is removed for inspection the rivet should be replaced by a new HSFG bolt or 
by reaming the hole and fitting a close tolerance bolt.  
NOTE 1 
Where HSFG bolts are used in connections with mixed bolts and rivets, the HSFG bolts can 
be considered only to act in friction at ULS. This is because slip is prevented by the rivets, 
preventing any clearance bolt from acting in bearing/shear. 
I.7  
Material testing 
Where testing is required for strength according to Annex H, test specimens and tensile 
testing for plates and sections shall be accordance with BS EN 10025.  
Strain rates in tensile testing should be similar to those used in mill testing.  
Where testing is required for toughness according to 6.5, Charpy impact testing shall be 
carried out.  
NOTE 1 
Where a sample is taken which includes a weldment it is usually effective to carry out a 
range of tests, similar to that for weld procedure tests, including toughness testing using 
Charpy specimens, macroscopic sections including hardness tests, and tensile tests.  
NOTE 2 
Sub-size Charpy specimens can be used to minimise the size of the samples required or to 
suit the details being tested. Sub-size Charpy specimens test temperatures require 
correction from the nominal test temperature which can be done using the method described 
in BS 7910 and require adjustment to achieve equivalent full-size specimen values based on 
the ratio of net cross-section area. 
The location of samples should be in accordance with the following: 
1) To make use of results of such tests in accordance with Annex H, the samples should be 
taken in the same structure and considered to be likely to have been supplied from the 
same batch of material. 
2) Where possible samples should be taken from a position on a member remote from its 
critical region. 
3) The locations of the samples within a section should be relevant to the strength criteria 
being used (e.g. within a flange of a beam when considering bending capacity) and in 
accordance with BS EN 10025. 
4) The location of Charpy specimens within a weldment shall be in accordance with BS 
5400-6 Annex B. 
Where samples are taken from an existing structure for any purpose, the introduction of 
stress concentrations in the structure shall be avoided.  
The method and extent of removal shall avoid modification of the material properties of the 
samples due to heat input. 
I.8 
Criteria for re-inspection of welds 
Where re-inspection of the welds is necessary, the criteria in this section shall be applied. 
Non-destructive testing (NDT) of welds should be carried out in accordance with the 
recommendations of BS EN ISO 17635 including visual testing (VT) in accordance with BS 
EN ISO 17637 and other methods of NDT as described below.

PAGE 116 of 174
======================================================================
115 
 
NOTE 1:  Non-destructive testing (NDT) is now considered to include visual testing or examination of 
welds (VT). Refer to BS EN ISO 17635 Table 1. Note visual testing (VT) includes taking 
measurements of weld features. 
The acceptance criteria for NDT should be in accordance with BS5400-6 as a minimum.  
NOTE 3 
Additional NDT or acceptance criteria can be required in some cases to comply with the 
assumptions of the assessment, e.g. in critical welds sensitive to fatigue or with low 
toughness.  
The minimum extent of inspection should be in accordance table I.1 for butt welds and table 
I.2 for fillet welds. 
Where a defect is identified in a weld by any NDT method, the extent of MT and UT (where 
applicable) shall be increased to 100% of the weld length. 
NOTE 2  
The extent of inspection in tables I.1 and I.2 is based on the requirements of BS5400-6. 
For the purposes of the extent of inspection requirements of Table I.1 and Table I.2 a 
longitudinal weld shall be taken to be a weld for which the axis lies within 30° of the direction 
of tensile stress.  
Welds at all other orientations including remnants of temporary attachments shall be deemed 
to be transverse welds.

compression flanges 
J.1  
Effective stiffener imperfection

(𝛥𝑠𝑥)𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑟,𝑛)is the peak imperfection of stiffener 𝑛 in panel 𝑟, measured in accordance 
with the requirements for 𝛥𝑠𝑥 in BS5400-6. The sign of the imperfection is taken 
as +ve when the bowing is in the direction away from the stiffener outstand and

[BS5400-3, Add new Annex K] 
Annex K – Assessment of crossbeams in compression flanges 
K.1 
General 
This Annex may be used as an alternative method for the assessment of cross beams in 
compression flanges.  
To use this Annex, the critical longitudinal stress for buckling of the cross beams should be 
determined using the methods and subject to the provisions in K.2. 
The destabilising factors 𝑖1 and 𝑖2 should then be calculated using the methods in K.3.  
These values for the destabilising factors 𝑖1 and 𝑖2 should then be used in the assessment of 
the crossbeams, in place of the values from 9.15.4.5.4.  
NOTE 2 
This Annex gives the following benefits with respect to the design clauses: 
1) assessment is made possible for cases where 9.15.3.2 is not satisfied, by considering 
overall buckling of the flange,  
2) additional restraint from continuity can taken into account for crossbeams spanning more 
than 2 webs, 
3) benefit can be taken from a more favourable longitudinal stress distribution due to shear 
lag using Finite Element methods.  
4) these benefits can allow more favourable values of 𝑖1 and 𝑖2 to be calculated, thereby 
reducing the assessment load effects in the cross beam. 
K.2  
Calculation of critical stress, 𝝈𝒄𝒓 
The longitudinal stress, 𝜎𝑐𝑟 to cause elastic buckling of the crossbeam shall be calculated. 
The critical stress, 𝜎𝑐𝑟, may be obtained from finite element analysis using the eigenvalue for 
buckling load. For this purpose, the finite element analysis should be carried out in 
accordance with the guidance from BS EN 1993-1-5. Where it is difficult to identify the most 
critical mode relating to buckling of the crossbeam, it is recommended for the full analysis in 
accordance with 9.15.6.2 to be used. 
Alternatively the critical stress, 𝜎𝑐𝑟, may be obtained from finite element analysis using the 
Southwell plot method. For this purpose, the analysis should be as described in 9.15.6.2.  
NOTE 1 
For details of the Southwell plot method see Reference 9.15.4. 
For flanges without cantilevering parts, such as bottom flanges, the critical longitudinal stress 
may be calculated instead using Annex N. 
The equations and charts given in BD56/10 and previous versions should not be used.

K.3 
Calculation of destabilizing factors from the critical longitudinal stress 
Where the destabilising factors, 𝑖1 and 𝑖2, are to be calculated based on the critical 
longitudinal stress for buckling of the cross girder, 𝑖1 and 𝑖2 shall be calculated using 
Equations K.3a and K.3b respectively. 
𝑖1 
= 1 +
𝑙𝑖
𝐿𝑓(
𝜎𝑓
𝜎𝑐𝑟−𝜎𝑓) 
Equation K.3a 
𝑖2 
= (
𝜎𝑐𝑟
𝜎𝑐𝑟−𝜎𝑓) 
Equation K.3b 
where 
𝜎𝑐𝑟 
is the critical longitudinal stress for buckling of the cross girder, related to the 
longitudinal stress such that 𝜎𝑐𝑟= 𝜆𝑏𝜎𝑓, where 𝜆𝑏 is the factor of increase of 
stress 𝜎𝑓 in order to cause critical buckling. 
𝜎𝑓 
is the longitudinal compressive stress in the flange, based on the assumption of 
uniform in-plane stress without shear lag. 
𝜎𝑎 
is the longitudinal stress due to axial load (not subject to shear lag). 
𝜎𝑏 
is the longitudinal stress due to bending moment, = 𝜎𝑓−𝜎𝑎. 
𝑙𝑖 
is the half wavelength of buckling calculated. 
𝐿𝑓 
is as defined in 9.15.4.5.4. 
In the cross-beam assessment, these destabilizing factors should then be used to factor the 
effects from the applied loads in 9.15.4.5.1 and 9.15.4.5.2 for 𝑖1 and 𝑖2 respectively. 
NOTE 1 
Where loading has contributions of uniformly distributed load (giving the same effects on 
multiple cross beams) and concentrated loading (giving differing effects on adjacent cross 
beams), significant benefit can be achieved by separated the load into uniform and non-
uniform contributions for the application of 𝑖1 and 𝑖2. 
NOTE 2 
The use of destabilizing factors is described in Reference 9.15.2 for the context of the design 
code. 
For deriving 𝜎𝑐𝑟 benefit may be utilised in the cross beam assessment by using a modified 
longitudinal stress distribution due to shear lag. 
The benefit from shear lag shall not be utilised unless all other parts of the cross section, 
including girder flange and web checks, are also satisfied in this condition. 
Where full non-linear analysis is used which includes stress distribution of all collapse 
factored loads and takes account of all destabilising magnifications, then 𝑖2 = 𝑖1 = 1.0. 
K.4  
Measured imperfections 
The assessment imperfection (Δ𝑐𝑜) to be used shall be based on measured imperfections or 
the design tolerance (Δ𝑐𝑥).  
The assessment imperfection, Δ𝑐𝑜, should be calculated according to Table K.4, using the 
buckling wavelength, 𝑙𝑖, and other terms as defined below and in Figure K.4.

The adequacy of stiffened diaphragms not complying with the limitations in 9.17.2 may be 
assessed in accordance with this Annex.  
L.2  
Loading on diaphragms 
L.2.1  
Derivations 
The load effects in diaphragms and associated parts of box girders should be derived from 
global analysis undertaken in accordance with 9.4.1.  
The structure should be analysed by an elastic finite element method with shell elements to 
model all its primary components, including each box web and support diaphragms, so 
modelled as to enable the global forces transmitted to the boundaries of the diaphragms and 
their distribution to be determined.  
Analysis to determine load effects from local loads and reactions, including distortional 
effects, should be undertaken using a finite element method on a model of sufficient extent to 
ensure that the effects calculated are insensitive to assumed end conditions.  
The model should include any cross beams and cantilevers integral with the diaphragm. 
The models used should reproduce the actual geometry including any skew or out of 
verticality in diaphragm alignment.  
Supports to diaphragms should be modelled to represent their degrees of freedom and 
stiffnesses.  
Since stress fields derived from the analysis will be complex, reference may need to be 
made to L.9 in deriving effective stresses for buckling checks.  
The treatment of buckling of panels with large openings is not covered by this Annex and 
such panels should either be framed and ignored in stress analysis and strength checks or 
reference made to relevant research papers.  
L.2.2  
Effects to be considered 
The effects defined in 9.17.3.2 shall be included as appropriate. 
L.2.3  
Effective sections 
For determining stresses in a diaphragm the effective sections to be assumed should be 
derived in accordance with 9.17.4.2.2, 9.17.4.2.3(b) and (c), 9.17.4.4(a) and 9.17.4.5.

loading the analysis model shall be three dimensional. 
Where diaphragm openings do not comply with the limits in 9.17.2.8, the openings should be 
included in the analysis model or the affected panels ignored in analysis and strength 
assessments.

The effective stresses for buckling checks should be derived in accordance with L.3.1.2 with 
𝜎2𝑏 taken as the effective horizontal bending stress and 𝜎2𝑞 as the effective horizontal mean 
stress, and 𝜎𝑑2 = 𝜎2𝑏+ 𝜎2𝑞 in the panel under consideration. 
L.3.2.3  
Shear stresses 
The shear stresses, 𝜏, for yield checks should be derived in accordance with L.3.1.1.

Derivation of effective stresses in plate panels and stiffeners 
L.9.1  
Effective values of stresses varying in a complex manner in plate panels 
Where rectangular plate panels are subject to complex stress systems the following method 
may be used to determine effective stresses. 
Each panel should be considered to be composed of rectangular elements of uniform size, 
forming an array of 𝑝 elements over the dimension 𝑎, and 𝑞 elements over dimension 𝑏, as 
shown in Figure L.9.1. 
The mean values of each of the orthogonal stress components, 𝜎1 and 𝜎2, in each of the 
𝑝 ×  𝑞 elements in the panel should be first determined.  
The mean values of each of the orthogonal stress components should then be reduced to the 
six effective components of overall edge stresses in the whole panel shown in Figure L.9.1 
and defined as:  
𝜎𝑚1  
is the effective mean of stresses 𝜎1, 
𝜎𝑣1  
is the effective linear variation of 𝜎1 stresses in direction 1 (over half the panel 
length), 
𝜎𝑏1  
is the effective linear variation of 𝜎1 stresses in direction 2 (over half the panel 
width), 
𝜎𝑚2  
is the effective mean of stresses 𝜎2, 
𝜎𝑣2

width), 
𝜎𝑏2  
is the effective linear variation of 𝜎2 stresses in direction 1 (over half the panel 
length).

These effective stress components should be calculated from the stresses in the 𝑝 ×  𝑞 
elements by means of the arrays of coefficients given in Tables L.9a, L.9b and L.9c. 
1) To calculate 𝜎𝑚1, using the array in Table L.9a having p columns and q rows, the element 
stresses, 𝜎1, should be multiplied by the corresponding element coefficients, 𝑘𝑚, and 
summed. 
2) To calculate 𝜎𝑏1, using the array in Table L.9b having 𝑝 columns and 𝑞 rows, the element 
stress values, (𝜎1 - 𝜎𝑚1), should be multiplied by the appropriate coefficients, 𝑘𝑏, and 
summed. The coefficients should be used either as presented in Table L.9b, or reversed 
top to bottom, to obtain the larger positive value of 𝜎𝑣1. 
3) To calculate 𝜎𝑣1, using the array in Table L.9c having 𝑝 columns and 𝑞 rows, the element 
stress values, (𝜎1 - 𝜎𝑚1), should be multiplied by the appropriate coefficients, 𝑘𝑣, and 
summed. The array should be used with larger coefficients to the left or to the right in 
such a way as to obtain the larger positive value of 𝜎𝑣1. 
4) The stresses 𝜎𝑚2, 𝜎𝑏2 and 𝜎𝑣2 should be obtained similarly from the element stresses, 𝜎2, 
by turning the stress array through 90°, making the direction of application of the stress 
coincident with that shown in Tables L.9a to L.9c. 
All coefficients should to be applied algebraically with compressive stresses always being 
regarded as positive. 
The effective uniform shear stress should be calculated using Equation L.9.1a:

𝑎(𝑄1+𝑄3)−𝑏(𝑄2+𝑄4)

where   
𝑄1, 𝑄2, 𝑄3, 𝑄4 are the boundary shear forces acting on each edge of the panel, taken as 
positive if in a clockwise direction. (See Figure L.9.2) 
Where the direct stress resultants on opposite edges of a panel are unequal as shown in 
Figure L.9.1, effective uniform stresses, 𝜎1 and 𝜎2, may be calculated as follows: 
𝜎𝑚1 + 𝜎𝑣1 and 𝜎𝑚1 + 𝜎𝑣1 should be taken as the longitudinal direct stresses on the two 
opposite shorter edges.

[BS5400-3, Add new Annex N] 
Annex N – Modified critical buckling stress of stiffened panels utilising 
orthotropic actions 
N.1.1 
General 
The methods in this Annex may be used to assess stiffened panels using the benefit of 
orthotropic stiffness.  
For this purpose, the minimum factor against critical buckling, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛, should be calculated. 
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛 shall be taken as the lowest of: 
1) 𝛼𝑐𝑟 according to N.2, and 
2) 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 according to N.4. 
Values of 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 shall be derived for each stiffener in a multi-stiffened panel 
with due allowance for any variation of 𝜎1, 𝜏 and 𝜎2 (i.e. particular 𝜎1 in web panels).  
The minimum value of 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟 (as derived for the whole stiffened panel) 
shall then be adopted as the governing 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛 for each stiffener. 
Where panels have negligible coincident in-plane shear and transverse stress, the sub-panel 
buckling modes in 2) and the corresponding factors 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1.and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 may be ignored. 
NOTE 
Additional methods are also provided in this Annex to carry out strength checks for stiffened 
panels under combined stress. 
N.1.2 
Derivation of Strength 
The capacity of each effective longitudinal stiffener shall be checked at both the tip of the 
stiffener outstand and at the junction with the attached plate boundary, with stresses 
appropriately magnified for the governing (minimum) load factor against buckling, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛, 
derived from N.1.1.  
NOTE 1 
Although each stiffener strictly requires separate checks on both aspects, generally for multi-
stiffened panels with uniform equally spaced stiffeners the governing stiffener will be 
apparent by inspection (e.g. when the maximum shear stress and maximum longitudinal 
compressive stress are concurrent on the same stiffener).  
NOTE 2 
Methods for the outstand check are given in N.1.3 and methods for the plate boundary check 
are given in N.1.4.  
The checks shall include the effects of residual stresses and assumed values of initial 
imperfections.  
NOTE 3 
Methods for treatment of residual stresses and imperfections are given in N.1.5 and N.5.3. 
N.1.3  
Stiffener Outstand Checks 
N.1.3.1 
Verification method using modified radius of gyration  
Checks may be made using 9.3.2 (flanges), 9.11.5.2 (webs) and 9.17.6.7 (diaphragms) as 
appropriate but in each case using 𝑟𝑠𝑒 calculated from Equation N.1.3.

Equation N.1.3 
where 
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛 
is the governing (minimum) load factor against critical buckling. 
𝜎𝑠𝑒 
is the appropriate equivalent stress in the stiffener in accordance with 
9.10.2.3(a), 9.11.5.2 and 9.17.6.3.4 for flanges, webs and diaphragms 
respectively. 
𝑎𝑠 
is the length of the stiffener (i.e. 𝑙 for flanges, 𝑎 for webs and 𝑙𝑠 for diaphragms) 
compatible with the use in N.4.2. 
 
NOTE 1 
Based on this expression for 𝑟𝑠𝑒, the slenderness for a stiffener can be expressed as 𝜆𝑠𝑒=
𝑎𝑠

𝜎𝑦𝑠
355 = 75√
𝜎𝑦𝑠
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑚𝑖𝑛𝜎𝑠𝑒 , where 𝜆𝑠𝑒 is the equivalent 𝜆 for use on Figure 19 or 24. 
NOTE 2:  Note that this procedure is iterative due to the dependence of the slenderness parameter, 𝜆, 
as well as the buckling coefficients (𝑘𝑠 and 𝑘𝑙) on 𝑟𝑠𝑒.  
The procedure in N.1.5 and N.5.3 may be used to allow for the variation of initial 
imperfections (and residual stresses, if required) as well as effective stress levels in the plate 
via use of modified effective widths of plate. 
N.1.3.2 
Verification method using amplified stress  
As an alternative to the method in (N.1.3.1), to obtain the maximum capacity and benefits, 
the stiffener outstand stress (𝜎𝑜) may be derived from IDWR clause 20.3.3 using values 
derived in accordance with 20.3.1, but with total assumed initial imperfection (Δ𝑜) and 
residual stresses (𝜎𝑅𝑏 and 𝜎𝑂𝑅𝑆) derived in accordance with N.1.5.  
The stiffener outstand stress (𝜎𝑜) should then be checked against the limiting outstand stress 
allowing for torsional buckling (i.e. the 'lower yield stress' 𝜎𝑦𝑠 of the stiffener calculated in 
accordance with 9.3.1). The effective width of plating for derivation of stresses should be 
based on the secant effective width of plating, 𝐾𝑏𝑠, see N.5. 
Torsional buckling limiting stress should not be derived from IDWR clause 20.3.4 as this may 
produce an overestimate of the outstand limiting stress. 
N.1.4  
Plate Boundary Check 
N.1.4.1  
Verification method using modified radius of gyration 
Checks may be made by using the methods in N.1.3(i) using 𝑟𝑠𝑒 also as set out in N.1.3 (i), 
but using the plate limiting stress in place of the outstand limiting stress.  
NOTE 1 
Thus for flanges the modified 𝜎𝑠𝑒= 𝜎𝑎+ 2.5𝜏𝑖𝑘𝑠2 (as per 9.10.2.3(b)) is checked against a 
modified 𝑘𝑙2𝜎𝑦𝑒𝛾𝑚𝛾𝑓3
⁄
.  
For webs a conservative check may be made by taking 𝜎𝑠𝑒= 𝜎𝑦𝑤(𝑚𝑐+ 𝑚𝑏+ 3𝑚𝑞), where 
𝜎𝑦𝑤, 𝑚𝑐, 𝑚𝑏 and 𝑚𝑞 are derived in accordance with 9.11.4.

NOTE 2:  Note that this procedure is iterative due to the dependence of the slenderness parameter, 𝜆, 
as well as the buckling coefficients (𝑘𝑠 and 𝑘𝑙) on 𝑟𝑠𝑒.  
The procedure in N.1.5 and N.5.3 may be used to allow for the variation of initial 
imperfections (and residual stresses, if required) as well as effective stress levels in the plate 
via use of modified effective widths of plate. 
N.1.4.2  
Verification method using amplified stress 
As an alternative to the method in (N.1.4.1), to obtain the maximum capacity and benefits, 
the stress at the plate/stiffener junction, i.e. the plate boundary stress (𝜎𝑏) may be derived 
from IDWR clause 20.3.2 using values derived in accordance with 20.3.1 but with total 
assumed initial imperfections (Δ𝑜) and residual stresses (𝜎𝑅𝑏 and 𝜎𝑝𝑟𝑠) derived in accordance 
with N.1.5, and then checked against the limiting boundary stress (𝜎𝐵𝐿) derived in 
accordance with IWDR clause 20.2.2d.  
For this purpose the effective width of plating should be based on 𝐾𝑏𝑠 the secant effective 
width of plating, see N.5. 
N.1.5  
Allowance for variation of residual stresses and plate imperfections 
The combined effect of variation of residual stresses and initial imperfections on effective 
widths of plates may be allowed for using the method in N.5.3. 
NOTE 1 
Residual stresses are not dealt with explicitly in either this document or BS 5400-3. All the 
BS 5400-3 rules have a built-in assumption of actual residual stress assumed at a level of 
10% of yield. The effect of these is generally small in design, particularly in the case of non-
slender elements. However for assessment, particularly for web panels, these levels of 
stress can be a high proportion of basic capacity when very slender panels and stiffeners are 
assessed. The separate effect of variation of plate and stiffener initial imperfections on 
strength (measured, specific or assumed) can be dealt with by the relevant rules in this 
document for longitudinal stiffener and plate panel checks.  
In cases where residual stresses are known or can be shown to be less than 10% of yield, or 
where residual stresses can be treated as equivalent imperfections, the full procedure of 
clauses 18 and 19 of the IDWR may be used. 
NOTE 2 
The procedure in IDWR clauses 18 and 19 provides alternative methods to account for 
residual stress and initial imperfections that can give particular benefit for 𝑏𝑡
⁄  and/or 𝑙𝑟𝑠𝑒
⁄
≥
60 if the residual stress is treated as an additional imperfection. 
Clause 7 of the IDWR may be used to derive residual stresses where required. 
NOTE 3 
The IDWR allows imperfections to be fully considered and also allows some residual 
stresses to be replaced as equivalent imperfection; an added benefit when assessment 
strength capacity is low. Again for b/t and/or l/r ≥ 60, the full procedure of clauses 18, 19 and 
20.3 of the IDWR can be used to obtain additional benefit, as set out in N.1.2 to N.1.4 above 
for strength, N.4.3 for plate buckling factor (𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝) and N.5 for secant effective width (𝐾𝑏𝑠).

N.2.4  
Interaction between stresses for overall buckling of stiffened panels 
Where the strength of a stiffened panel is assessed using N.1.3 or N.1.4 and the stiffened 
panel is subject to more than one coincident type of applied in-plane stress, the minimum 
load amplifier, 𝛼𝑐𝑟, for the design loads to reach the elastic critical load of the plate under the 
complete stress field shall be determined.  
NOTE 
For rectangular panels with simple stress patterns, a method is given in BS EN 1993-1-5 for 
the interaction between the stress types. 
N.3  
Evaluation of parameters for calculating the critical stress for a stiffened panel 
The values of the stiffness parameters of a panel shall be evaluated as follows, with 
coordinate axes and panel dimensions shown in Figure N.1. 
𝐼𝑜𝑥, 𝐼𝑜𝑦 
are the second moments of area for the effective stiffener cross section, for the 
longitudinal stiffeners (in direction 1) and for the transverse stiffeners (in 
direction 2) respectively. The cross section of the stiffener includes an effective 
width of plating on each side as defined in 9.10.2.2 with values appropriate to 
the effective in-plane stresses in the plating elements, with due allowance for 
out-of-plane bending of the stiffened panel. Where the effective cross-section of 
a stiffener varies along its length, the average value of I applies. For vertical 
web stiffeners in panels designed as having fully restrained boundaries the 
effective width on each side is as defined in 9.11.5. 
𝐽𝑥, 𝐽𝑦 
are the torsion constants for the longitudinal stiffeners (in direction 1) and for 
the transverse stiffeners (in direction 2) respectively.

planes of the stiffener walls.

respectively.

Where the longitudinal stiffeners are unequal or unequally spaced, the critical 
stresses can be obtained by assuming the panel to be equivalent to one having 
uniform longitudinal stiffness per unit width equal to the average stiffness within 
the compression zone in the case of pure compression and pure in-plane 
bending, and to the average stiffness in the entire stiffened panel in the case of 
shear. In assessing the average stiffness the effective stiffness of each stiffener 
is related to its position in the panel as follows. For compression and shear the 
effective second moment of area of any longitudinal stiffener is taken as: 
 
𝐼𝑠,𝑒𝑓𝑓= 1.5𝐼𝑜𝑥(1 −

𝑁+1

Where 𝐼𝑜𝑥 is the second moment of area of the stiffener, 𝑏𝑠 is the width of the 
stiffened panel at right angles to the stiffener, 𝑦𝑠 is the distance from the centre 
of the stiffened panel to the stiffener, 𝑁 is the number of longitudinal stiffeners. 
 
For in-plane bending the effective second moment of area is taken to vary 
linearly from zero, when the stiffener is on the boundary or on the neutral axis 
to 
2𝐼𝑜𝑥 when it is located at a distance from the compression boundary 
equal to 0.2 times the distance from that boundary to the neutral axis. 
𝐷𝑦

longitudinal axis).

Sub-panel buckling 
N.4.1  
General 
In addition to deriving the load factor, 𝛼𝑐𝑟, against overall buckling in accordance with N.2 
which allows for the benefit of orthotropic action as several stiffeners buckle in the same 
direction, the sub-panel buckling modes shall also be calculated according to this section.  
NOTE 1 
The sub-panel modes allow for the destabilising effects of longitudinal, transverse and shear 
stresses in the adjacent plate panels on possible stiffener buckling modes as required in 
accordance with 9.10.2.3 for flange stiffeners, 9.11.5.2 for web stiffeners and 9.17.6.7 for 
diaphragm stiffeners. 
The following two basic modes shall be considered: 
1) sub-panel buckling mode 1 (spb1) in which adjacent stiffeners buckle in opposite 
directions; and 
2) sub-panel buckling mode 2 (spb2) in which alternate stiffeners remain generally straight 
and the stiffeners in between buckle in opposite directions. Where there is only one 
longitudinal stiffener in a stiffened panel, only mode 2 applies. 
The factors against sub-panel buckling, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 for modes 1 and 2 respectively 
should be derived using the expressions given in N.4.2.  
NOTE 1  
The equations in N.4.2 include benefit from the stabilising effect of the plate. 
NOTE 2 
Guidance on improved strength derivation is given in N.1.3.  
NOTE 3 
Methods for the derivation of plate effectiveness and the associated effective widths of plates 
to be used are given in N.4.3 and N.5 respectively. These are applicable to all modes. 
N.4.2  
Factor Against Sub-Panel Buckling 
The factor against buckling for sub-panel buckling mode 1, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1, and for sub-panel 
buckling mode 2, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2, may be calculated using Equation N.4.2a and Equation N.4.2b 
respectively.

𝐼𝑂𝑋 
is the second moment of area of the effective stiffener section including a total

𝐾𝑏𝑡 
is the tangent effective width of plating associated with the stiffener under 
consideration, see N.5.1. 
𝑏 
is the spacing of equally spaced stiffeners, or the average spacing on each side 
of the stiffener for unequally spaced stiffeners. 
𝑎𝑠 
is the length of the stiffener in direction 1 between main cross members or 
other points of attachment providing full restraint against buckling.

under consideration.

the area of the stiffener under consideration in direction 1. 
𝑡𝑒𝑓𝑓2 
is the effective plate thickness in direction 2, given by 𝑡(1 +
∑𝐴𝑆𝑌
𝑎𝑠𝑡), where ∑𝐴𝑆𝑌 
is the sum of any secondary stiffeners in direction 2(i.e. orthogonal to the main 
stiffener under consideration.) For most cases ∑𝐴𝑆𝑌= 0. Where there is any 
variation in size or spacing, 
∑𝐴𝑆𝑌
𝑎𝑠 should be based on stiffeners in the middle 
third of the length 𝑎𝑠. 
In cases of unequal spacing, b, or of unequal thickness, t, either side of the stiffener under 
consideration, 𝐼𝑂𝑋 should be based on a section comprising 𝐴𝑆𝑋 together with associated 
effective plating given by 0.5(𝐾𝑏𝑡1𝑏1𝑡1 + 𝐾𝑏𝑡2𝑏2𝑡2), where 𝐾𝑏𝑡1, 𝑏1, 𝑡1 and 𝐾𝑏𝑡2, 𝑏2, 𝑡2 apply to 
the plating either side of the stiffener.

Elsewhere such as for 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1, 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2 and 𝑡𝑒𝑓𝑓1, 𝑏 may be taken as 0.5(𝑏1 + 𝑏2). 
NOTE 
In all cases the sub-panel buckling mode assumes a single half wavelength of length 𝑎𝑠, for 
the stiffener and plate.  
N.4.3 
Stabilising effect of plate 
Where the sub-panel buckling load factor 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏1 is calculated in accordance with N.4, the 
modified critical stresses 𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′ , 𝜎𝑐𝑟2
∗′ , 𝜏𝑐𝑟
∗′  shall be calculated from the following expressions. 
𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1𝜎1,𝑒𝑓𝑓  
𝜎𝑐𝑟2
∗′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1𝜎2,𝑒𝑓𝑓  
𝜏𝑐𝑟
∗′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1𝜏𝑒𝑓𝑓  
where 
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1 
is the minimum load amplifier to cause elastic buckling of the combined action 
of component stresses 𝜎1,𝑒𝑓𝑓, 𝜎2,𝑒𝑓𝑓 and 𝜏𝑒𝑓𝑓 on the effective panel of size 
𝑎𝑠× 𝑏 with the stiffener excluded. See N.4.4. 
Similarly, where 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑠𝑝𝑏2 is calculated, the modified critical stresses 𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′′ , 𝜎𝑐𝑟2
∗′′ , 𝜏𝑐𝑟
∗′′ shall be 
calculated from: 
𝜎𝑐𝑟1
∗′′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2𝜎1,𝑒𝑓𝑓  
𝜎𝑐𝑟2
∗′′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2𝜎2,𝑒𝑓𝑓  
𝜏𝑐𝑟
∗′′ = 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2𝜏𝑒𝑓𝑓  
where 
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2 
is the minimum load amplifier to cause elastic buckling of the combined action 
of component stresses 𝜎1,𝑒𝑓𝑓, 𝜎2,𝑒𝑓𝑓 and 𝜏𝑒𝑓𝑓 on the effective panel of size 
𝑎𝑠× 2𝑏 with the stiffener excluded. See N.4.4. 
N.4.4  
Calculation of 𝜶𝒄𝒓,𝒑𝟏 and 𝜶𝒄𝒓,𝒑𝟐 
𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2 may be calculated, in order to give maximum benefit, based on a buckling 
mode shape which has only one half wavelength of buckling over the stiffener length, 𝑎𝑠.  
NOTE 1 
It is conservative to calculate 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2 instead for the mode shape with the most 
critical number of half wavelengths, rather than restricting it to only 1. BS EN 1993-1-5 and 
the IDWR both give methods for this. 
For the purpose of deriving 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2, variation of in-plane bending stress may be 
considered by adding one sixth of the bending stress to the direct stress.  
NOTE 1 
Note that the effects of varying stress are considered differently for spb1 and spb2 than for 
the overall orthotropic mode, where bending stress over the whole panel would generally be 
considered explicitly.

For the purpose of deriving 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝1 and 𝛼𝑐𝑟,𝑝2, variation of 𝜎1 stress along the length or of 
𝜎2 stress across the width of the panels may be considered by taking the highest 
compressive value in the middle third.  
N.5  
Effective Widths of Plating 
N.5.1  
Tangent Effective Width, 𝑲𝒃𝒕, for Stiffness 
For flange stiffeners the effective width of plating for use in deriving 𝐼𝑜𝑥 (in N.4 and N.3) for 
stiffness shall be taken as one of the following: 
1) a conservative total effective width of 0.5b for any plate slenderness or level of 
compression.  
2) an effective width based on 𝐾𝑐′′, as an approximation for any elements acting primarily 
under direct stress where transverse stress or shear are negligible; or 
3) for flanges under combined stresses, variation of imperfection or residual stress, 
conservative values of 𝐾𝑏𝑡 in accordance with N.5.3(b). 
For web stiffeners the effective width of plating for use in deriving 𝐼𝑜𝑥 (in N.4 and N.3) for 
stiffness shall be taken as one of the following: 
1) a total effective width of 32𝑡𝑤 (1 −𝜌) but not exceeding 𝑏(1 −𝜌) in accordance with 
9.11.5.1; or 
2) an effective width based on the procedure given in IDWR clause18 to derive 𝐾𝑏𝑡; or 
3) for webs, under combined stresses, variation of imperfection or residual stress, 
conservative values of 𝐾𝑏𝑡 in accordance with N.5.3(b). 
NOTE 1 
Although more accurate methods of deriving 𝐾𝑏𝑡 are available from Figure 5b and in the 
IDWR and could be used, generally little advantage is gained for effective stiffener stiffness. 
For other elements effective widths shall be taken as those used in the effective section, 
such as defined in 9.13.2 (or 9.14.2) for transverse web stiffeners, 9.15.2 for flange 
transverse members, 9.16.4.1 for ring frames and 9.17.4.4 for diaphragm stiffeners. 
N.5.2  
Secant Effective Width, 𝑲𝒃𝒔, for Stress or Strength 
The effective width of plating for stress shall be taken as one of the following: 
1) the secant effective width, 𝐾𝑏𝑠 can be taken as equal to 𝐾𝑏𝑡 in N.5.1 as a conservative 
value; or  
2) for element under primarily direct stress by using 𝐾𝑐′ from Figure 5a in 9.10.2.2.  
3) for combined stresses a conservative value of 𝐾𝑏𝑠 can be obtained in accordance with 
N.5.3(a).  
NOTE 1 
However the degree of conservatism could limit the strength, particularly in the case of 
derivation of 𝑟𝑠𝑒 and consequent benefits when considering sub-panel buckling modes or 
orthotropic actions, particularly for webs.  
4) an effective width based on the value of 𝐾𝑏𝑠 using the procedure given in clause 18 of the 
IDWR. 
NOTE 2 
The procedure in IDWR enables full benefit of levels of plate stress to be obtained as well as 
allowing for any level of initial imperfections and residual stress, see N.1.5.

N.5.3  
Effective Widths under the Action of Combined Stresses, Varying Imperfections and 
Residual Stresses 
Where a conservative value of 𝐾𝑐′ is required from Figure 5a under the action of combined 
stresses, 𝐾𝑐′  shall be calculated using 𝜎𝑎′ = 𝐾𝑐′𝛾𝑚𝛾𝑓3𝜎𝑠𝑒 in Figure 5a, with 𝜎𝑠𝑒 being the 
equivalent effective stress taken as the greater of the values derived from N.1.3 or N.1.4.  
Where adjustment is required for residual stress or imperfection (see N.1.5), this may be 
accounted for by use of Annex P using 𝜎𝑅 as required in place of 0.1𝜎𝑦𝑒 and Δ𝑋 as 1.2 
multiplied by the initial imperfection in the plating (measured, taken from the construction 
specification or assumed). 
Where a conservative value of 𝐾𝑐′′ is required from Figure 5b a similar procedure shall be 
applied as for 𝐾𝑐′, but using Figure 5b instead of Figure 5a. 
N.6  
Imperfection measurements for stiffened panels 
Where overall buckling governs, the half-wavelengths of buckling to be adopted as the gauge 
length 𝐺, for use in the measurement of initial out-of-plane deformations of stiffened panels in 
compression shall be taken as 𝑙/𝑚.  
where  
𝑚  
is the integer value appropriate to the values of 𝜓 and 𝛷′, within the boundaries 
of the dotted lines on Figure N.4.  
For both sub-panel buckling modes (1 and 2), the gauge length, 𝐺, and the half wavelength 
of buckling shall be taken as 𝑎𝑠, the length of stiffener in direction 1 between main cross 
members or other points of attachment providing full restraint against buckling compatible 
with the implied mode of behaviour considered in N.4 resulting from the destabilising effects 
of transverse and/or shear stress.  
NOTE 1 
Thus for flanges 𝑎𝑠 is taken as 𝑙, for webs 𝑎𝑠 is taken as a and for diaphragms 𝑎𝑠 is taken as 
𝑙𝑠.

[BS5400-3, Add new Annex P] 
Annex P – Effective width coefficients for plates unrestrained in plane 
along their longitudinal edges 
P.1 
Introduction 
This Annex shall be used where necessary to calculate the coefficients 𝐾𝑐′ or 𝐾𝑐′′ for 
unrestrained plates with any out-of-plane deformation Δ𝑥 measured after welding in 
accordance with BS 5400-6 with or without welding residual stress. 
Values of 𝐾𝑐′ may be derived from clauses P.2 to P.4. 
NOTE 1 
The Annex gives the basis for Figures 5a and 5b in 9.10.2.2. 
The objective of this Annex should be to calculate 𝐾𝑐′ or 𝐾𝑐′′ by performing the following 
stages of calculation: 
1) The out of flatness imperfection Δ𝑥 and the welding residual stress for the panel should 
be determined.  
2) The theoretical initial imperfection value, Δ0, of the plate before welding should be 
calculated using the out of flatness imperfection after welding, Δ𝑥, and the welding 
residual stress, in accordance with P.2. 
3) The magnification factor, 𝑚, of imperfections under the applied stress should be 
calculated in accordance with P.3. 
4) The secant effective width coefficient, 𝐾𝑐′, or the tangent effective width coefficient, 𝐾𝑐′′, 
should then be calculated in accordance with P.4. 
NOTE 2  
Where plates form part of a cross section, iteration is required because 𝜎𝑎′ in P.3 depends on 
the value of 𝐾𝑐′. 
P.2 
Calculation step 1 – Calculation of initial imperfection, 𝚫𝟎 
The value of Δ0 shall be obtained from Equation P.2.

Equation P.2 is a quadratic equation and can be solved by the standard solution.

Introduction 
Where directed by clause 9.3.1, the methods in this appendix shall be used to determining 
the ‘lower yield stress’ 𝜎𝑦𝑠 of stiffeners for use in subsequent strength calculations. 
NOTE:  
This method does not give a ‘lower yield stress’, 𝜎𝑦, of the plate to which the stiffener is 
attached. While the plate yield is significant in determining limiting proportions in some of the 
individual sub-clauses of 9.3, it is not relevant to this Annex.

S.2.1.3 
Imperfections 
For the purpose of calculating the imperfection parameter in S.2.1.2, the effective stiffener 
imperfection, 𝛥𝑆𝑌𝐸, shall be derived from the measured imperfection or the fabricated 
tolerances for the structure and the buckling length 𝑙𝑠. 
The equations below may be used where the gauge length G for measurement of 𝛥𝑠𝑦 does 
not match the buckling length 𝑙𝑠.  
Where 𝐺 is less than 𝑙𝑠, Δ𝑆𝑌𝐸 should be taken as: 
𝛥𝑆𝑌𝐸

𝛥𝑠𝑦

Equation S.2.1.3a 
Where 𝐺 is greater than 𝑙𝑠, Δ𝑆𝑌𝐸 should be taken as: 
𝛥𝑆𝑌𝐸 
= 𝛥𝑠𝑦{1 −𝑠𝑖𝑛[
𝜋
2 (1 −
𝑙𝑠
𝐺)]} 
Equation S.2.1.3b 
where 
𝐺  
is the gauge length for measurement of 𝛥𝑠𝑦. 
𝑙𝑠  
is the buckling length calculated in the relevant section of S.2.2 or S.2.3. Where 
the lower bound for 𝜎𝑐𝑟 from S.2.3.1 is used, 𝑙𝑠 should be taken as 𝐿.   
𝛥𝑠𝑦  
is the specified tolerance or measured value for lateral departure from 
straightness of the stiffener.  
Where fabrication has been in accordance with BS5400-6, the tolerance value of Δ𝑠𝑦 and 
associated gauge length G may be taken from BS5400-6.  
NOTE 1 
The most accurate results are obtained when the measurements are made using a gauge 
length equal to the buckling length 𝑙𝑠. 
S.2.2  
Flat Stiffeners, calculation of 𝝈𝒄𝒓

Hence, the procedure is iterative, as follows: 
1) Guess a value of 𝑘 (between 0.43 and 1.28 which represent simply supported edges and 
fully fixed long edge respectively.) 
2) Determine 𝑙𝑠 from Figure S.1 (but see NOTE 3). 
3) Determine 𝛼 from the expression above.  
4) Determine 𝜀 from the expression above. 
5) Determine 𝑘 from Figure S.2. 
6) Correct the initial guess for 𝑘 and repeat as necessary until calculated 𝑘 is sufficiently 
close to the original guess, and then derive 𝜎𝑐𝑟. 
NOTE 3  
Where 𝛼= 0, 𝑘 tends to 0.43 and 𝑙𝑠ℎ𝑠
⁄
tends to ∞, i.e. 𝑙𝑠 tends to 𝐿. 
Where 𝜎𝑝𝑐𝑟 is low and combination of 𝜎𝑝1 and 𝜎𝑝2 is high such that 𝛼= 𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜, a higher value

NOTE 1: 
Hence, the procedure to determine 𝜎𝑐𝑟 is iterative, similar to that for flat stiffeners: 
1) Guess a value of 𝑙𝑠 (try 𝑙𝑠= 5𝐻). 
2) Check 𝑙𝑠< 𝐿. 
3) Determine 𝛼 from the expression in S2.2.  
4) Determine 𝛽 from the expression above. 
5) Determine 𝑙𝑠 from the expression above. 
6) Correct the initial value of 𝑙𝑠 and repeat until convergence is obtained. 
 
𝜎𝑐𝑟 is derived using the converged values of the parameters. 
NOTE 2 
This method of allowing for the restraint to the long edge gives little benefit for the zero or 
very small restraints (i.e. for 𝛼 and for 𝛽 small enough to imply the preferred half wavelength 
of buckling 𝑙𝑠> 𝐿). In such cases the lower bound to 𝜎𝑐𝑟 can be used given by the equation 
for the simply supported case in S.2.3.1.

General 
The methods in this Annex shall be used where necessary in order to determine the 
adequacy of plates under a combination of stresses and with imperfections that are different 
from the tolerances in BS5400-6.  
NOTE 1 
The basis is the well-established use of elastoplastic large deflection computer methods and 
checks with nominal imperfections show satisfactory agreement.  
The calculation should involve the determination of the individual buckling coefficients 𝐾1, 𝐾𝑞, 
𝐾𝑏 and 𝐾𝑐, and the modification of them to take into account the actual level of imperfection 
by means of factors 𝑘Δ1, 𝑘Δq, 𝑘Δb and 𝑘Δc.  
NOTE 2 
The buckling coefficients 𝐾1, 𝐾𝑞, 𝐾𝑏 and 𝐾𝑐 are given as polynomials in 𝛽 which are ‘best-fit’ 
curves to results obtained from large deflection elasto-plastic analysis. The basic buckling
