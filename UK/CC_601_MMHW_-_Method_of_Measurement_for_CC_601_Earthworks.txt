1. Definitions
1.
Definitions
1.1
The Earthworks Outline, unless stated otherwise, shall be defined as the finished earthworks levels and
dimensions (prior to topsoiling) required by the Contract for the construction, where specified, of:
a)
carriageway, hard shoulder, hard strip, footway, paved area, cycle track, central reserve, verge,
side slope;
b)
subbase;
c)
earthworks fill on subbase material, base, capping or filter layer;
d)
contiguous filter material, lightweight aggregate infill;
e)
surface water channels;
f)
areas of landscape fill.
1.2
In all cases of filter drains, except narrow filter drains, the Earthworks Outline shall be the top of the
filter material.
1.3
Where capping or stabilisation to form capping or a filter layer is required by the Contract in cutting or
on embankment, the Earthworks Outline shall be as defined clause 1.1 of this document i.e. as the
underside of capping or filter layer.
1.4
Where an embankment is required by the Contract to be surcharged, the Earthworks Outline shall be
as defined in clause 1.1 of this document and exclude the surcharge.
1.5
Where permanent storage or stockpiling of topsoil is required by the Contract, the Earthworks Outline
shall be as defined in clause 1.1 of this document and exclude stored topsoil.
1.6
Where the bottom of a structural foundation for an earth retaining structure (other than for reinforced
earth and an anchored earth structure) is below Existing Ground Level, the Earthworks Outline shall be
the permanently exposed face of the structure below Existing Ground Level.
1.7
Where the bottom of the facing foundation for a reinforced earth structure or an anchored earth
structure is below Existing Ground Level, the Earthworks Outline shall be the inside face of the facing
above Existing Ground Level to the underside of the capping unit, or where no capping unit is required,
to the finished earthworks level prior to topsoiling.
1.8
Where the ground has been subjected to treatment under the Contract in respect of ground
improvement, abandoned mine workings and natural voids, for the purpose of this document Existing
Ground Level shall be the level obtained upon completion of any such treatment of the areas affected.
Note a
Surcharge is defined as material used for ground improvement including that placed on embankments
for the purpose of loading the embankment for the periods stated in the Contract.
Note b
For the purpose of measurement, a 'soft spot' is defined as formation material not meeting the
minimum formation strength requirements.
Note c
A 'Designated Outline' pertains to work measured and priced (lump sum) in CC 604/MMHW [Ref 13.N],
CC 605/MMHW [Ref 14.N] and CC 606/MMHW [Ref 15.N].

CC 601/MMHW Version 1.0.0
2. Measurement
2.
Measurement
General
2.1
For the purposes of CC 601/MMHW [Ref 12.N] it shall be assumed that one cubic metre of earthworks
material excavated forms one cubic metre of compacted earthworks fill.
2.2
No allowance shall be made in the measurement for bulking and shrinkage of any earthworks material.
2.3
Earthworks within Designated Outlines shall not be measured in CC 601/MMHW [Ref 12.N].
2.4
Excavated earthworks material arising from the Works measured in accordance with other sections in
the MMHW shall be excluded from any computation in CC 601/MMHW [Ref 12.N].
2.5
Where placement and compaction of an embankment has been carried out in accordance with the
Contract and settlement occurs:
1)
either subsequent to the Earthworks Outline having been reached, or in the case of a surcharged
embankment subsequent to the removal of the surcharge; or
2)
from settlement of or penetration into the ground beneath the embankment;
3)
then the additional fill, placement and compaction required shall be measured immediately prior
to the preparation of formation, excluding the first 75mm of settlement or penetration.
2.6
In areas of earthworks fill where settlement or penetration occurs, the additional earthworks fill,
placement and compaction required shall not be measured.
Note
The Contractor retains overall responsibility to provide acceptable earthworks materials as defined in
the Contract.
2.7
All earthworks materials excavated from within the Site, which at the point of excavation, comply with
the acceptability requirements for any of the various classes of earthworks fill permitted by the Contract
shall be classified and measured as excavation of acceptable earthworks material.
2.8
The sequence of measurement items shall be as as follows:
1)
Excavation of unacceptable earthworks material Classes U1A and U1B (in cutting etc).
2)
Extra over excavation for excavation in Hard Material in cutting and other excavations.
3)
Processing of unacceptable earthworks material Classes U1A and U1B to acceptable earthworks
material stated class or classes.
4)
Placement of acceptable earthworks material (in embankments etc).
5)
Compaction of acceptable earthworks material (in embankments etc).
Note
The earthworks schedules may require additional items under the earthworks fill sections depending on
specification and placement requirements.
Processing materials
2.9
A change in classification and measurement from excavation in unacceptable earthworks material to
placement of acceptable earthworks material shall occur only where the Overseeing Organisation
specifies processing of unacceptable earthworks materials to render the material acceptable under
clause 2.6 of this document.
2.10
If the Contractor is permitted to render unacceptable earthworks material acceptable for use in the
Works (as opposed to when instructed by the Overseeing Organisation) then measurement shall be as
though the unacceptable earthworks material had been disposed of and acceptable earthworks
material of the class rendered acceptable, imported.
Note
If the Contract requires that unacceptable earthworks material is rendered acceptable then that
earthworks material is measured as treatment of unacceptable earthworks material and then
considered to be acceptable earthworks material arising from the Site.

CC 601/MMHW Version 1.0.0
2. Measurement
Compaction and placement of earthworks fill
2.11
The volume of material measured in Compaction of Earthworks Fill shall include the quantities
measured in Imported Earthworks Fill and Placement of Earthworks Fill.
2.12
The quantity of material measured in Placement of Earthworks Fill shall relate only to the acceptable
earthworks material arising from the Site including material so arising as unacceptable but required to
be processed to become acceptable and not that measured in Imported Earthworks Fill.
Geological terms
2.13
Excavated material which comes within the definition of acceptable earthworks material shall be billed
as stated in the MMHW and GP 114 [Ref 6.N] and not described by a geological term or common name
e.g. chalk.
Surcharge material
Note a
Excavation of earthworks acceptable material which is to be used as Surcharge, should be measured
and identified separately. Earthworks schedules should include the volumes of surcharge material
placed and removed.
Note b
The inclusion at clause 3.5 of this document of "(p) disposal of surcharge material (clause 7.6 of this
document) where occasioned by the Contractor's method of working;" as item coverage is not intended
to specifically cover the disposal of the measured volume of residual surcharge material as calculated
in accordance with clause 3.2 c) of this document. The measurement and earthworks balance is based
on the re-use of residual surcharge material. The Contractor may, however, wish for his own
operational reasons to import material for the finished embankment and dispose of the residual
surcharge, e.g. subject to (a) CC 601 [Ref 2.N], and/or GC 102 [Ref 16.N]. The replacement by the
Contractor of acceptable earthworks material arising on site is an obligation imposed on the Contractor
under clause 5.2 of CC 601 [Ref 2.N]. Item coverage for excavation has therefore been extended to
include the cost of the Contractor's optional disposal of surcharge.
Note c
This principle would apply also to any constraints imposed by the Overseeing Organisation under the
Contract which, in all practicality, prevented the re-use of surcharge material. MMHW measurement
paragraphs have been drawn up to apply universally and in order to provide for use of all available
acceptable arisings irrespective of optional or imposed constraints which obviate such use. Due
allowance should be made by tenderers in their rates against the measured quantities to reflect their
actual disposal/import requirements. Item coverage clause 3.5 p) of this document provides for
disposal of surcharge only where the Contractor opts for disposal to suit his method of working or
where constraints in the contract inhibit re-use of surcharge material.
