Guidance for drainage surveys task order and price list
Note a
These sections are included for guidance only and is a word version of the corresponding excel
document used to procure drainage surveys. The Drainage Contract Task Order Proforma and Price
List in Section, Star Rates and Compensation Events in Sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 are fully compatible
with CS 551 [Ref 1.N].
Note b
This proforma can be used to instruct the Contractor to carry out a Drainage Survey Task.
Note c
This proforma requires a desktop version of Excel. It will not work with either the web-based version of
Excel or the OpenOffice desktop spreadsheet.
Note d
The Client completes Part A of the Task Order proforma (including estimated Quantities in the Price
Lists if applicable, and the requirements in the Task Brief) and sends to the Contractor with any
attached drawings or documents referenced in the Task Brief.
Note e
The Contractor completes Part B of the Task Order proforma and submits a price and plan to carry out
the Task to the Client by the required deadline.
Note f
On the Price List - day tab, each individual rate is built up from the cost of People, Plant & Materials,
Subcontractor Costs and/or Equipment as appropriate, all increased by the Fee percentage (the
Contractor's overheads and profit). It is intended that the rates and rate build-up are replicated from the
Price List - day tab, to all the other Price List tabs, with an additional percentage rate adjustment
applied at the bottom of each tab to allow for unsocial hours working, this adjustment may vary across
the Price Lists. Some items are only applicable to the Price List - day tab, and are not carried through
to the other Price List tabs. The total of each Price List tab is carried through to the Task Order tab to
give the price for the task.
Note g
Any task specific star rates are added by the Contractor in the Star Rates tab, including a detailed
description of the works/services required. A quantity of 1 is added to the SR1 item in the relevant Price
List tab for the total of the Star Rates tab to carry through. Star rates can only be applied to one of the
Price Lists by this means (day, night, weekend & BH day or night).
Note h
The Client completes Part C1 or C2 of the Task Order proforma which instructs the Contractor to carry
out the Task or not carry out the Task and sends back to the Contractor.
Note i
The Task Brief provides the technical details of the drainage surveys for the required Task referenced
against the requirements and detailed specifications of each survey type in CS 551 [Ref 1.N]. Where
options are available and a default selection is given the default should be chosen unless there is good
reason to select one of the alternatives. Further details are required for some items, either to be given
in the text box provided, or as referenced attached documents or drawings. Instructions to the Task
specifier are provided throughout.
Note j
After the task is complete the works are remeasured. Any unforeseen items that are not covered by the
standard Price List items are quoted as a Compensation Event. Compensation Events may be positive
(additional costs for works carried out or delays beyond the Contractor's control) or negative (reduction
due to cancelled or revised scope of works). The Compensation Event totals carry through to the base
of the Task Order tab to give the outturn value for the task.
