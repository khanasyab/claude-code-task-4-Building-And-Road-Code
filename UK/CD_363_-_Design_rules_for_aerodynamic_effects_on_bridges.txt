Introduction
Introduction
Background
The original version of these rules first appeared as the "Proposed British Design Rules" in 1981 ICE
1981 [Ref 2.I]. A modified version was included in the TRL Contractor Report 36 TRL CR36 [Ref 3.I],
which also contained the associated partial safety factors and guidance on the use of the rules.
Major changes in 1993 version of BD 49
In the light of their use in bridge design from 1981, further consideration was deemed necessary with
respect to a number of items. The more notable aspects embodied in the 1993 version of BD 49 were
the rules which determined whether the designs of certain footbridges and steel plate-girder bridges
needed to be based on wind tunnel testing.
Background information on these modifications is available in TRL CR256 [Ref 1.I].
Major changes in 2001 version of BD 49
Since the 1993 version of this standard, further wind tunnel tests have been carried out and other
studies have been undertaken, which have led to further amendments to the rules. Background is
provided in TRL RR530 [Ref 5.I]. The 2001 version of the rules incorporates the outcome of this work,
including:
1) more reliable criteria for plate girder bridges, based on a comprehensive series of tests on wind
tunnel models; and
2) a review of the rules in the light of experience leading to:
a) improved considerations of edge details;
b) amendments to all critical wind speeds;
c) improved accuracy of vortex shedding amplitudes;
d) more accurate criteria for aerodynamic susceptibility; and
e) initial guidance on proximity effects.
Major changes in this version of BD 49 (now CD 363)
Many of the provisions of BD 49/01 have since been repeated in BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 3.N], NA to BS
EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 7.N] and PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N]. This version of BD 49 (now CD 363) only contains
the provisions that have not been repeated in the above referenced documents and indicates where the
repeated provisions are located.
Additional guidance
Guidance on the use of the design rules is available in TRL Contractor Report 36 TRL CR36 [Ref 3.I].
Actual bridge configurations being designed that may correlate with sections physically tested
previously may benefit from use of the archive test data which are held in the library of the Institution of
Civil Engineers ICE Box Girders [Ref 4.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] apply to this document.

2. General requirements
2.
General requirements
2.1
The adequacy of the structure to withstand the dynamic effects of wind, together with other coincident
loading, shall be verified in accordance with Eurocode 1 ( BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 3.N]), as implemented
by the DMRB (see PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N]).
2.2
The design shall assess if limited amplitude responses can cause unacceptable stresses or fatigue
damage.
NOTE
Two types of limited amplitude response can occur:
1) vortex-induced oscillations: these are oscillations of limited amplitude excited by the periodic
cross-wind forces arising from the shedding of vortices alternatively from the upper and lower
surfaces of the bridge deck. They can occur over one or more limited ranges of wind speeds. The
frequency of excitation can be close enough to a natural frequency of the structure to cause
resonance and, consequently, cross-wind oscillations at that frequency. These oscillations occur in
isolated vertical bending and torsional modes;
2) turbulence response: because of its turbulent nature, the forces and moments developed by wind on
bridge decks fluctuate over a wide range of frequencies. If sufficient energy is present in frequency
bands encompassing one or more natural frequencies of the structure, vibration can occur.
2.3
Divergent amplitude responses shall be avoided.
2.3.1
Identifiable divergent amplitude aerodynamic mechanisms, leading to oscillations of this type may
include:
1) galloping and stall flutter - galloping instabilities arise on certain shapes of deck cross-section
because of the characteristics of the variation of the wind drag, lift and pitching moments with angle
of incidence or time; and
2) classical flutter - this involves coupling (i.e. interaction) between the vertical bending and torsional
oscillations.
2.4
Non-oscillatory divergence shall be avoided.
NOTE
Non-oscillatory divergence can occur if the aerodynamic torsional stiffness (i.e. the rate of change of
pitching moment with rotation) is negative. At a critical wind speed, the negative aerodynamic stiffness
becomes numerically equal to the structural torsional stiffness resulting in zero total stiffness.
2.5
Consistent units shall be used.
NOTE
As an example of a consistent set of units, 1 Newton is the force required to accelerate 1 kilogram at
1m/s2.

Limited amplitude response - vortex excitation
Critical wind speeds for vortex excitation
3.2
Estimates of critical wind speeds ( vcrit,i ) at which vortex excitation can occur shall be determined in
accordance with the method given in PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N], Section A.1.3.1 and Figure A.2.
Limiting criteria
3.3
Any bridge with a fundamental frequency greater than 5Hz shall be assumed stable with respect to
vortex excitation.
3.4
Other criteria used to determine the susceptibility of a bridge to vortex excited vibrations shall be in
accordance with PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N], Section A.1.2.

3.5
Where the bridge cannot be assumed to be aerodynamically stable against vortex excitation, the
effects of maximum oscillations of any one of the motions evaluated singly, shall be combined with the
effects of other coincident loading (see Section 4).
3.6
Where the bridge cannot be assumed to be aerodynamically stable against vortex excitation, fatigue
damage shall be assessed in accordance with Section 5, summed with damage from other fatigue
loading.
3.7
The amplitudes of response to vortex excitation shall be determined in accordance with PD 6688-1-4
[Ref 2.N], Section A.1.5.4.1.
3.8
Assessment of the significance of vortex excitation effects shall be determined in accordance with PD
6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N], Section A.1.5.4.5.
Limited amplitude response - turbulence
3.9
To determine whether or not the dynamic magnification effects of turbulence can be neglected,
reference shall be made to the NA to BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 7.N], Section NA.2.49.2
3.10
Where the magnification effects of turbulence cannot be ignored, a gust buffeting dynamic analysis
shall be carried out to calculate the peak amplitudes and modes of vibration under a 10-minute mean
wind speed of vm(z) (as defined in NA to BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 7.N], Section NA.2.49.2 b).
3.11
Proximity effects (wake buffeting) shall be evaluated.
3.11.1

Appendix A. Guidance on proximity effects
Appendix A. Guidance on proximity effects
A1
Introduction
Most obstacles in the path of the wind contribute to the creation of turbulence, either directly by vortex
shedding or indirectly through the build-up of the profile of mean wind speed with height which in turn
provides more severe velocity differentials when the flow is further perturbed. The basic turbulence is
the statistically steady (or developing slowly over a distance of many kilometres) summation of the
effect of a broadly random scatter of such obstacles over a substantial region upwind of the reference
point. Where there are identifiable outstanding obstacles, further specific allowance may be necessary.
The turbulence generated by such identifiable objects decays on translation downwind into a more
random structure comprising a widening range of gust sizes (or spectral frequencies), eventually being
subsumed into the basic random 'background'. There is thus a range of potential effects. Where there
are obstacles (topographic or man-made) that are large compared with the cross-section of the bridge,
wind tunnel tests can be used to check on the consequences of any change in turbulence affecting the
bridge.
A parallel, or near-parallel, prismatic obstacle such as another bridge should be included in any wind
tunnel tests. However, where the gap is small compared to the characteristic dimension of the 'vortex
street' (say, less than the structure depth) the formation and shedding of vortices become strongly
linked. Assessments for small and moderate separation are given below.
A2
Twin-deck configurations
The term 'twin-deck bridge' is used here to describe a bridge with parallel decks each supported by the
same structural form with equal structural depth, with a gap between the decks not exceeding one
metre, and the deck edges bordering the gap (or each gap) not differing in level by more than 250 mm.
The gap may be closed by an apron, or left open. The deck cross-falls may be in the same sense or
reversed.
A3
Evaluation of parameters for vortex shedding
For the evaluation of the critical wind speed for vortex excitation (see Section 3), the reference width b*
should be determined according to PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N] Figure A.4, applied to the overall
cross-section ignoring the existence of the gap when the gap complies with the twin-deck configuration
in A2 above. For all other provisions in this Appendix A, the evaluations should be based on the
parameters for the upwind deck. Additionally, the prediction made of response amplitude ymax for
vertical motion caused by vortex shedding (see Section 3) should be increased by a factor of 1.4 to
conservatively allow for the interactive response of the twin-deck system.
Where the gap exceeds G2 (see A4 below) each bridge deck may be treated separately with respect to
vortex excitation. For gaps in the ranges of G1 to G2 (see A4 below), the estimate of the limiting
response amplitude to vortex shedding, ymax , given in Section 3 should be doubled. For gaps between
1m and G1 (see A4 below) for twin deck configurations and less than G1 (see A4 below) for all other
configurations, the interactive vortex response of the dual system should be investigated.
A4
Other proximity effects
The limiting value of P(z) as defined in NA to BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 7.N], Clause 2.49.2 should be
halved if there is a parallel structure with a clear gap G such that G1 < G < G2 , where:
G1 is the lesser of d′ or b′
3 ; and
G2 is the greater of 24d′ or 6b′
in which d′ and b′ are the overall depth and breadth respectively of the neighbouring structure.
Where the gap is less than G1 the parallel structures may be considered as a single structure for
turbulence effects.

Appendix B. Guidelines for wind tunnel testing
Appendix B. Guidelines for wind tunnel testing
B1
Introduction
This appendix provides some guidelines to assist the engineer who intends to make use of wind tunnel
model testing. These guidelines should not be regarded as complete as testing techniques are
continually being developed. Other publications should be referred to for more extensive details of the
theory and practice of wind tunnel testing.
In providing relatively comprehensive procedures it is recognised that sometimes it becomes necessary
to relax modelling requirements in order to obtain practical information. It is important to stress the
need for an awareness of the limitations of wind tunnel model tests in general with special caution in
situations where partial or approximate models are used.
There are three basic reasons for undertaking wind tunnel tests:
1) to obtain static coefficients to be used in the basic static design checks for wind or for input to the
analysis of turbulence response (see Section 3);
2) to obtain coefficients for checks on vortex excitation effects or divergent amplitude effects (see
Section 3). Such tests require dynamic models, and can also yield either direct estimation of
turbulence response or 'derivative' coefficients which enable more sophisticated analysis of
turbulence response to be carried out;
3) to examine the influence of topography or other perturbations of the incident wind such as large
structures or other obstacles nearby. A potentially important effect is inclination of the mean wind to
the horizontal (quantity α in PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N], Section A.5).
Aeronautical wind tunnels (wind tunnels operating with laminar flow) are typically used for large scale
models to accurately simulate the structure, deck furniture and highway or railway traffic. More
accurate measurements of mean loads require a simulation of the turbulence characteristics of wind,
but this requires a model whose scale is too small to be practicable. Smooth flow tests are thus
generally acceptable for these measurements providing upper bound values to the coefficients when
compared to those appropriate to the natural wind.
Studies into the influence of topography or other perturbations of the incident wind require simulation of
the salient properties of the wind. Wind tunnels designed to develop this type of flow are classified as
boundary-layer wind tunnels (BLWT). The required small scale of the topography is such that a realistic
model of the bridge itself is impracticable.
Both types of wind tunnel use air at atmospheric pressure and operate in a low-speed range of 10-50
m/s.
Where relevant, proximity effects need to be considered and adjacent structures modelled (see
Appendix A).
B2
Use of smooth flow (laminar) tests to determine time average coefficients
Tests on sectional models of bridge decks can be used to determine the mean or static components of
the overall wind load on the model. These wind loads can be obtained using rigid models with
geometrically scaled features.
Accurate measurements of both the mean and the dynamic components of the overall loads can only
be obtained if both the approach flow and the local environment are properly simulated. For the scale
of model bridge required, this becomes impracticable.
Approaches towards evaluating overall wind loads include the spatial averaging of instantaneous
pressures acting on the elements of the bridge structure and the direct measurement of such loads with
force balances or transducers capable of providing accurate information on both their mean and
time-varying components. Sections comprising circular section members or other curved surfaces are
likely to be Reynolds number ( Re ) -sensitive and adjustments based on full-scale data and/or
theoretical data may be used. Modelling adjustments are commonly needed for very small elements
such as handrails to avoid local Re effects below about 500.

Appendix B. Guidelines for wind tunnel testing
The effect of wind inclination in elevation should be examined. The extent of the effect should be
judged depending on the site topography, any planned super-elevation of the bridge and predicted
torsional deflections under traffic loads. Generally tests up to ±5° are adequate.
B3
Section model tests to determine aerodynamic stability
The primary objective of section model tests is to determine the aerodynamic stability of the bridge
deck, mounted with deck furniture, using a geometrically scaled model of a section of the bridge
elastically mounted in a wind tunnel. Typically, such models simulate the lowest bending and torsional
vibration frequencies, and are tested in uniform laminar flow. The requirements of geometric scaling
and Reynolds number limitations, outlined in B2, still apply. In more advanced or refined stages,
section models are tested in simulated turbulent flow in order to provide estimates of the responses at
sub-critical wind speeds. As the simulated turbulence generally has a preponderance of the
smaller-size eddies most likely to influence flow features such as vortex-shedding or re-attachment, the
total intensity of turbulence should be selected with care. Generally this should be significantly lower
than the standard atmospheric value for full scale. Reliance on beneficial effects from turbulence
should not be allowed to reduce the likely aerodynamic effects.
In addition to modelling the geometry in accordance with B2, it is necessary to maintain a correct
scaling of inertia forces, the time scale, the frequency, and the structural damping. The time scale is
normally set indirectly by maintaining the equality of the model and full-scale reduced velocities of
particular modes of vibration. The reduced velocity is the ratio of a reference wind speed and the
product of a characteristic length and the relevant frequency of vibration. See vRg  and vRf in PD
6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N], A.2.4.1 and A.4.4 for 'galloping' and 'flutter'. The numerical coefficient for vortex
excitation in Section 3 is also derived from use of a similar ratio.
Measurements should be carried out through the range of wind speeds likely to occur at the site to
provide information on both relatively common events, influencing serviceability, and relatively rare
events, which govern ultimate strength behaviour. Wind inclination in elevation should be examined.
Measurements of vortex excitation require careful control of the wind speed around the critical velocity,
and any predicted divergent amplitudes should be assessed to ensure they do not become so violent
as to destroy the model.
B4
Aero-elastic simulations of bridges
A dynamic model of the full bridge should be used in the wind tunnel, commonly referred to as an
aero-elastic model, to provide information on the overall wind induced mean and/or dynamic loads and
responses of bridges. Such models are particularly valuable for slender, flexible and dynamically
sensitive structures, where dynamic response effects may be significant. To be representative the tests
should consistently model the salient characteristics of natural wind at the site and the aerodynamically
significant features of the bridge's geometry. It is also necessary to correctly model the stiffness, mass
and damping properties of the structural system.
It is only possible to model the full spectrum of atmospheric turbulence in a wind tunnel at small scale;
together with the obvious constraint of fitting a full bridge model within the tunnel, this is generally
irreconcilable with the scale desirable to ensure correct behaviour, which is commonly sensitive to
small changes in cross-section. For this reason the primary study should be made by section model
tests; where non-uniformity of section or of incident flow conditions, complex dynamics or erection
considerations, necessitate the use of a full model, particular care is needed in its design and
interpretation of the test results.
As the modelling of dynamic properties requires the simulation of the inertia, stiffness and damping
characteristics of only those modes of vibration which are susceptible to wind excitation, approximate
or partial models of the structural system are often sufficiently accurate.
B5
Studies of the wind environment
B5.1
Topographic models
Information on the characteristics of the full scale wind may not be available in situations of complex
topography and/or terrain. Small scale topographic models, with scales in the range of 1:2000, can be

Appendix B. Guidelines for wind tunnel testing
used in such situations to provide estimates of the subsequent modelling of the wind at a larger scale
and are suitable for studying particular wind effects on the bridge.
B5.2
Local environment
Nearby buildings, structures, and topographic features of significant relative size influence the local
wind flow and hence should be allowed for in simulations of wind at particular locations. For bridges in
urban settings this requires the scaled reproduction (usually in block outline form) of all major buildings
and structures within about 500 to 800 m of the site. Also of particular importance is the inclusion of
major nearby existing and projected buildings, which can lead to aerodynamic interference effects,
even if they are outside this "proximity" model.
Corrections are generally required if the blockage of the wind tunnel test section by the model and its
immediate surroundings exceeds 5 to 10%. Typical geometric scales used in studies of overall wind
effects or for local environment tests range between 1:300 to 1:600 approximately.
B5.3
Use of boundary layer wind tunnels (BLWT)
A BLWT should be capable of developing flows representative of natural wind over different types of
full-scale terrain. The most basic requirements are as follows:
1) to model the vertical distribution of the mean wind speed and the intensity of the longitudinal
turbulence; and,
2) to reproduce the entire atmospheric boundary layer thickness, or the atmospheric surface layer
thickness, and integral scale of the longitudinal turbulence component to approximately the same
scale as that of the modelled topography.
In some situations a more complete simulation including the detailed modelling of the intensity of the
vertical components of turbulence becomes necessary.
B6
Instrumentation
The instrumentation used in wind tunnel model tests of all aforementioned wind effects should be
capable of providing adequate measures of the mean and, where necessary, the dynamic or time
varying response over periods of time corresponding to about 1 hour in full scale. In the case of
measurements of wind induced dynamic effects, overall wind loads and the response, the frequency
response of the instrumentation system should be sufficiently high to permit meaningful measurements
at all relevant frequencies, and avoid magnitude and phase distortions.
All measurements should be free of significant acoustic effects, electrical noise, mechanical vibration
and spurious pressure fluctuations, including fluctuations of the ambient pressure within the wind tunnel
caused by the operation of the fan, opening of doors and the action of atmospheric wind. Where
necessary, corrections should be made for temperature drift.
Most current instrumentation systems are highly complex and include on-line data acquisition
capabilities which in some situations are organised around a computer which also controls the test. It
may be possible to provide useful information with more traditional techniques including smoke flow
visualisation. Although difficult to perform in turbulent flow without proper photographic techniques, flow
visualisation remains a valuable tool for evaluating the overall flow regime and, in some situations, on
the potential presence of particular aerodynamic loading mechanisms.
B7
Quality assurance
The reliability of all wind tunnel data should be established and should include considerations of both
the accuracy of the overall simulation and the accuracy and hence the repeatability of the
measurements. Checks should be devised where possible to assure the reliability of the results. These
should include basic checking routines of the instrumentation including its calibration, the repeatability
of particular measurements and, where possible, comparisons with similar data obtained by different
methods. For example, mean overall force and/or aero-elastic measurements can be compared with
the integration of mean local pressures.

======================================================================
CD 363 Revision 0
Appendix B. Guidelines for wind tunnel testing
Ultimate comparisons and assurances of data quality can be made in situations where full-scale results
are available. Such comparisons are not without difficulties as both the model and full-scale processes
are stochastic. It is also valuable to make credibility crosschecks with the code requirements and
previous experience.
B8
Interpretation of test data and prediction of full-scale behaviour
The objective of all wind tunnel simulations is to provide direct or indirect information on wind effects
during particular wind conditions.
For time average effects this relates to the appropriate design wind speed either with or in the absence
of traffic as appropriate. Dynamic response requires prediction of the full-scale wind speeds at which
vertical and/or torsional vortex excitation occurs as well as the speed at which divergent response is
likely to start.
Particular care is required in relation to simulation and scaling such as, for example, with respect to
wind speed, turbulence (intensity and length scales), frequency and damping (see B2, B3 and B5) as
well as the bridge geometry and properties (see B4). The range of wind angles considered needs to
take due account of the requirements in PD 6688-1-4 [Ref 2.N] Section A.5. Where measurements
have been undertaken in turbulent flow (see B3 and B4), the intensity of turbulence and associated
length scales need to be reported for both the reduced and full size intensities and length scales.
