Terms and definitions
Term
Definition
Datum
A fixed starting point for scale measurements, typically used in
reference to measuring height; that is, the location is a measured
distance above or below a known datum level.
Light detection and ranging
A remote sensing technique, that uses laser emitters to map spatial
positions and record the reflected wavelengths and intensity of light
from objects in the scene.
Spatial accuracy
Stated accuracy declares that the survey data is within (+/-) a maximum
tolerance of its real-world position. For each accuracy level there is a
degree of confidence; the reliability that the observation adheres to the
stated accuracy. Confidence is measured by the standard deviation
from the mean, for example, 2 sigma = 95% confidence.
Survey area
The area of interest for which the topographical survey data is required
Survey bench mark
Physical marks made to record height above a known datum. Typically,
they are found on buildings and other semi-permanent features,
chiselled into hard surfaces.
Topographical survey
A type of geomatical survey concerned with capturing an accurate
representation of the land, and natural or man-made features.
Trigonometrical station
A fixed surveying station used as a reference point for laying out survey
control. Typically, a concrete pillar erected on the pinnacle of a hilltop or
mountain to allow for connected sight lines between multiple stations.

Topographical data and features
Topographical data
3.1
Topographical data shall only comprise geographic vector file formats or 3D polylines/linestrings, in
accordance with the requirements within GG 184 [Ref 3.N].
NOTE
Topographical data uses 2D or 3D points, lines, and polygons to represent the physical form of
features, accompanied by associated metadata to differentiate feature types, and their granular detail.
3.2
All topographical data shall be in a format that facilitates its use and the reproduction of copies in
necessary formats.
3.2.1
Use of proprietary formats and forms of presentation should be avoided.
3.3
Where the features surveyed extend up or down from ground level, separate layers shall be provided
for the ground level lines and the other vertical extent.
NOTE
For example, the tops of walls, fences, ditches will be in separate layers from their bases.
3.4
Features at ground level shall not cross except at a common point.
3.5
Features at ground level shall not be continuous across bridge decks.
3.6
Features at ground level shall stop and restart at the ends of the bridge deck.
3.7
Features that represent closed extents shall be geometrically closed.
3.8
Feature property information shall be provided as embedded attributes, not as unrelated data.
NOTE
Feature information can include levels, references, and measurements.
3.9
Asset codes shall be as required by the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
A list of current Highways England Asset Codes is available in table A.1 in GG 184
Feature listing
3.10
A feature list, of all feature types that are to be recorded in the topographical data, shall be in
accordance with the survey specification.
3.10.1
An individual project may have a specific aim, and therefore constrain interest to a sub-set of the
possible feature types.
NOTE
For example, a renewals project for road restraint assets will have specific interest in these asset
features (barrier types, end terminals, crash cushions) and carriageway features that influence their
placement and function (such as, carriageway edges, kerbing, markings/lines, and adjacent
structures). Many other features would be irrelevant to the purposes of the survey, and therefore would
not be requested in the topographical data for delivery.
Benchmarks and trigonometrical stations
3.11
Where listed by the survey specification, survey benchmarks and trigonometrical stations shall be
defined as individual features within the topographical data.
NOTE
Survey benchmarks or trigonometrical stations will sometimes be present in the survey area; these
features correspond to legacy or alternative referencing systems. They are not typically used by
contemporary techniques to assure survey spatial accuracy, however recording these items can be
valuable; linking the survey data to this reference, legacy control, and other historic data sets.
Temporary features
3.12
Where listed by the survey specification, temporary features shall be recorded in such a way to
differentiate them from permanent features.

3. Topographical data and features
NOTE
Temporary features can include temporary signage, barrier, or other transient objects.
Feature definition
3.13
The specific geometric definition of individual features shall be in accordance with the survey
specification.
NOTE
Feature definition includes form, rules for their geometry and representation.
3.14
For each feature, the following minimum requirements shall be defined:
1) name - unique, common, name for the feature;
2) description - text detail describing the nature of the feature;
3) hierarchy - any class or grouping the feature belongs to, multiple grouping levels can be used,
including permanent or temporary features;
4) elements - sub-divisions of the feature that each correspond to a distinct feature in the topographical
data, such as a kerb feature having separate elements for the kerb face and kerb top;
5) geometric form - for each feature/element the geometric form; for examples open/closed 3D
poly-line, volumetric solid, point, and symbols;
6) geometric definition - for each feature/element a description detailing the position of the geometric
line-work/vertices for the feature;
7) layer naming - in accordance with GG 184 [Ref 3.N]; and,
8) symbology - where required, the visual representation of the feature can be defined.
NOTE 1
Item 3 (above): multiple grouping levels can be used, including permanent and temporary features.
NOTE 2
Item 4 (above): in the example, a kerb feature has separate elements for the kerb face and kerb top,
which would be recorded in the topographical data.
NOTE 3
Item 8 (above): symbology can include specific line work, colour, and symbols used to define features
in the topographical data.
3.14.1
Additional requirements may be defined in the survey specification, unique to the implementation for
certain feature types.
NOTE
To facilitate feature definition, Overseeing Organisations can provide existing (sample) data as an
example, on which the specification can be based.
Existing structures
3.15
Where any existing structure is among the features to be recorded, the feature definition shall be in
accordance with the survey specification.
NOTE
Structures, such as bridges, gantries, culverts, and tunnels are typically complex, multi-component
assets, and, as such, they can need more specific identification and definition for the survey in question.
3.15.1
Feature definition may include specific dimensions or details to be recorded, such as:
1) span(s);
2) headroom(s);
3) clearance(s); and,
4) spot levels.
3.15.2
Feature definition may be unique for each structure type present or for each individual structure.

Topographical data quality
Survey completeness
4.1
The completeness requirement for the survey shall be defined in the survey specification.
NOTE
The completeness of the survey data set refers to the correlation between the recorded data
area/objects and the true real-world area/objects. Required completeness is stated as a percentage.
Where this is less than 100% an allowance is made for data to be incomplete up to a limit; for example
a required completeness of 95%, indicates that up to 5% of the real-world data can be missing from the
recorded data. Practically, this can be used to allow for reasonable error or omission when dealing with
dispersed spatial areas and high numbers of feature objects.
4.1.1
The completeness requirement may be selected for the whole topographical data set, or different
completeness requirements may be selected for different feature types.
4.1.2
Any identified restrictions to the survey should be considered when evaluating completeness.
Spatial accuracy
4.2
The spatial accuracy requirement for the survey shall be defined in the survey specification.
4.2.1
The spatial accuracy requirement may be selected for the whole topographical data set, or different
accuracy may be selected for different feature types.
NOTE 1
The spatial accuracy of the survey data refers to the correlation between the recorded data object
position and the true real-world object position. Required accuracy states that the survey data can be
within (+/-) a maximum tolerance of its real-world position.
NOTE 2
For each spatial accuracy level there is a degree of confidence; that is the reliability that the observation
adheres to the stated accuracy. Confidence is measured by the standard deviation from the mean; for
example 2 sigma = 95% confidence - meaning 95% of all observations reliably fall within the stated
accuracy. The standard deviations that are typically relevant to spatial accuracy are as follows:
1) 1 sigma = 68% confidence;
2) 2 sigma = 95% confidence; and
3) 3 sigma = 99.7% confidence.
4.3
The spatial accuracy requirements shall be defined as in Table 4.3 below:

4. Topographical data quality
NOTE 1
Height accuracy requirements for soft detail will not exceed +/-25 mm, regardless of increasing
accuracy banding, due to the nature of these features; that is flexible or transient, with no consistent
surface height.
NOTE 2
Accuracy requirements apply to individual implementations of the survey. When combining or
comparing data from distinct surveys (taken at different intervals, or using different
techniques/equipment) there will typically be a decrease in the accuracy from a given data set, that is
greater than or equal to the sum of the tolerance ellipsoids.
4.4
Where a custom spatial accuracy band is selected, planar and height accuracy shall be defined for
desired sigma levels, as with Bands A-F.
Validation
4.5
All topographical data survey data (collected and processed) shall be checked and confirmed to be in
accordance with the survey data quality requirements as above in this section before delivery to the
customer for the survey.
