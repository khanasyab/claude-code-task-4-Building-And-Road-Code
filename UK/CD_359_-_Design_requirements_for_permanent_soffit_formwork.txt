Permanent formwork
Structure that is used to contain the placed concrete in order to
mould it into the required dimensions and support it until it is
able to support itself.
Participating permanent formwork
Permanent formwork which is a structurally participating
element forming an integral connection with the permanent
works.
Non-participating permanent
formwork
Permanent formwork which is not structurally participating in the
permanent works.

2. Design requirements

Design requirements
General requirements
2.1
Permanent formwork and in-situ concrete required for the deck shall satisfy all requirements for
strength, serviceability, fatigue, composite action and durability given in BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 5.N], BS
EN 1993-2 [Ref 6.N] and BS EN 1994-2 [Ref 7.N] as relevant.
NOTE 1
Specification requirements for permanent formwork are given in CC 482 [Ref 5.I].
NOTE 2
Additional guidance on the design of permanent formwork is given in CIRIA C558 [Ref 4.I], SCI P382
[Ref 3.I], SCI P339 [Ref 1.I] and CS 030 [Ref 2.I].
2.2
The design of precast reinforced concrete plank permanent formwork (floor plates) shall be in
accordance with BS EN 15050 [Ref 10.N].
2.3
The design shall allow for actions during execution and in service.
2.4
The design shall allow for the construction sequence and the behaviour of the formwork during
construction.
2.5
Deflection limits for the permanent formwork shall be determined taking into account appearance and
the movement of the formwork relative to the reinforcement.
2.5.1
Deflection of the permanent formwork between completion of concreting and four hours later, with due
allowance for the effect of creep, should not exceed 1/300 of the span.
2.5.2
The formwork may be pre-cambered by not more than 1/150 of the span of the formwork unit.
2.6
Reinforcement cover shall satisfy the design requirements after all deflection of the permanent
formwork during concreting and setting of the concrete has occurred.
2.7
Cover requirements shall be in accordance with A.3 of BS 8500-1 [Ref 2.N] and the relevant provisions
for participating and non-participating formwork below.
Participating formwork
2.8
Where participating reinforced concrete plank permanent formwork systems are used, the relevant
exposure class shall be applied to the concrete plank itself for cover requirements and concrete quality.
2.8.1
For bridge deck soffits more than five metres vertically above the carriageway, the exposure class for
the concrete plank should be taken as XD1 in accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 2.N].
2.8.2
A minimum of 20 mm cover should be provided from the upper surface of the concrete plank to the
reinforcement in the in-situ concrete slab above.
Non-participating formwork
2.9
Where the permanent formwork is non-participating, any potential adverse effect of differential
shrinkage or composite action shall be considered.
NOTE
Typical non-participating permanent formwork used for bridge decks include glassfibre reinforced
concrete (GRC), glass reinforced plastic (GRP) and profiled steel sheeting (PSS) systems.
2.10
Where non-participating permanent formwork systems are used, the relevant exposure class shall be
applied to the in-situ concrete above the permanent formwork for cover requirements and concrete
quality, ignoring the presence of the permanent formwork.
2.10.1
For bridge deck soffits more than five metres vertically above the carriageway, the exposure class for
the in-situ concrete above the non-participating permanent formwork should be taken as XD1 in
accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 2.N].
2.10.2
A minimum of 20 mm cover should be provided from the upper surface of the non-participating
permanent formwork to the reinforcement in the in-situ concrete slab above.

2. Design requirements
2.10.3
Where ribbed glass reinforced plastic (GRP) permanent formwork systems are used and where the
GRP ribs protrude into the concrete, the cover should be measured from the horizontal GRP/concrete
interface, provided that at least 20 mm is also provided between the top of the rib and the nearest
reinforcement.

Actions during execution
3.1
Participating formwork shall be designed to support actions during execution and permanent actions in
accordance with BS EN 1991-1-6 [Ref 4.N] and BS EN 1991-1-1 [Ref 3.N] respectively.
NOTE
Participating formwork forms part of the permanent structural elements and is therefore subject to the
same design requirements as the permanent works.
3.2
Non-participating formwork shall be designed to support actions during execution and permanent
actions in accordance with either BS EN 1991-1-6 [Ref 4.N] and BS EN 1991-1-1 [Ref 3.N]
respectively, or BS 5975 [Ref 1.N] and BS EN 12812 [Ref 8.N].
NOTE
Non-participating formwork is part of the temporary works and therefore the permanent design
considerations can be deemed not to comply provided the criteria for temporary works are met.
3.3
Irrespective of the design method employed, in no case shall the factor of safety against collapse of
formwork during execution, based on unfactored actions and resistances, be less than 2.0.
