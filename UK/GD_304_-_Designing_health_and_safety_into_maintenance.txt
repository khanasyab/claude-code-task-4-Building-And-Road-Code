GD 304 Revision 2
Introduction
Introduction
Background
The Overseeing Organisation has legal duties with respect to the safety of road workers, road users
and other parties.
These legal duties are derived from the following enabling legislation:
1) The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 HASAWA 1974 c.37 [Ref 2.N] - applicable in England,
Wales and Scotland. The Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978 SI 1978/1039 (NI 9) [Ref 3.N]
- applicable in Northern Ireland.
2) The Highways Act 1980 Highways Act 1980 [Ref 4.N] - applicable in England and Wales. The
Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 Roads(S) 1984 [Ref 6.N] and The Roads Order (NI) 1993 R(NI)O 1993
[Ref 8.N].
The detailed requirements for the discharge of duties under the enabling legislation are set out in topic
specific Regulations. Of particular relevance are the Construction (Design and Management)
Regulations SI 2015/51 [Ref 7.N] and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations SI
1999/3242 [Ref 1.N].
Designers have an important role to play in supporting the discharge of these duties. Health and safety
risk for all highway works should be managed throughout the whole life of the activity. The structured
assessment of risk in the design process, including the suitable and sufficient consideration of
maintenance can achieve safety improvements and whole life cost savings.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Table E/A.1 TYPE A: ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE (ELIMINATE THE HAZARD / AVOID THE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY THROUGH
BETTER OR ALTERNATIVE DESIGN)
No
GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
A1
Relocation of features
1) Move sign positions away from trees or vice versa, either longitudinally or
transversely.
2) Consider placing lighting columns in verge to facilitate lantern changes.
3) Consider placing lighting columns on approaches to under bridges rather
than on the bridge to remove the need to access them from the over bridge
itself.
4) Locate access to bridge interiors such that operatives can avoid live
carriageways (i.e. no access to manholes in carriageways).
A2
Consider alternative drainage designs
1) Use of vegetated drainage systems rather than buried hard solutions that
need regular or frequent maintenance (e.g. interceptors).
2) Cross carriageway drains can be difficult to maintain and repair in addition to
contributing to pavement failure if damaged. Avoid the use of offside gullies.
3) Use of semi-bound filter drain material to reduce stone scatter problems
from filter drains close to running lanes.
4) Avoid manhole covers within running lanes and hard shoulders / hard strip.
5) Provide overflow pipes to spillage ponds to prevent filling up with surface
water runoff resulting in need to regularly drain ponds.
A3
Eliminate need for any on-going work
1) Use materials for roadside features that have low maintenance
requirements thereby reducing the need for maintenance or replacement.
2) Design out roadside features and equipment thereby eliminating the need to
undertake maintenance work.
3) Use of non self-seeding variety trees.
4) No planting located within visibility splays.
A4
Edge line road studs placed on non-trafficked side of lines
No typical example.

GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
A5
Increase design life of assets
1) Increase pavement design life.
2) Choose barrier design life taking account of both working life costs and the
safety issues associated with in service maintenance of the barrier system.
3) Choose street lighting system with design life that take account of both
working life costs and the safety issues associated with in service
maintenance.
A6
Structures – design for durability/maintainability
Make bridge decks continuous and integral where possible – eliminate joints
and bearings.
A7
Reduce need for cleaning
Use of automated wash wipe systems for CCTV cameras to remove need for
manual cleaning of cameras. Materials or coatings that minimise the
accumulation of detritus.

Appendix E/A. Risk reduction examples
Table E/A.2 TYPE B: REDUCE THE HAZARD (REDUCED EFFORT)
Ref
GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
B1
Reduce amount of grass cutting
1) Use low growth species.
2) Harden central reserves to reduce grass cutting and litter picking.
B2
Reduce time exposure
Simplify tasks and methods e.g. design of gullies compatible with
common plant used to clean and empty gullies.
B3
Provide sign bins
Stock with commonly needed signs.
B4
Reduce manual handling effort during construction and maintenance
1) Give requirements for kerbs that do not unnecessarily restrict a
constructor's choice of construction methods and their ability to meet
their H&S obligations.
2) Fixed location of flapped or remotely operated TM signs.
3) Avoid over specifying manhole covers in non-trafficable areas, also
allow flat area to place lifted covers.
4) Specify requirements for components in performance terms to enable
constructors to use components made of lightweight materials e.g. in
the provision of fence panels and paving slabs.
B5
Reduce need for crash repair
1) At sign post locations in addition to consideration of whole life cost of
the options of road restraint protected posts and passively safe posts
with no restraint the relative maintenance safety issues should also
be considered.
2) Use socketed posts for signs or safety barriers that are likely to be
damaged often or could be difficult to access to repair e.g., where
safety barriers are founded in concrete or driven through hardened
surfaces, a sleeve may assist speed of repair. Repair databases

GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
B7
Increase life of assets
1) In choosing design lives for components ensure that safety risks of
in-service replacement of signs has been adequately taken into
account.
2) Lift metal objects from ground using plinths /platforms (if no driver
hazard created) to reduce corrosion risks.
3) Consider the use of sign face treatments that reduce the need for in
service maintenance interventions.
4) Prior to installation on site off site running of technology (soak testing)
prone to early life failure to minimise the need for in-situ repair or
replacement.
B8
Provide permanent crossover locations
1) Consider constructing central reserve crossovers on new roads for
future use.
2) If no crossover to be provided at outset, consider instead providing
minimal equipment in central reserve to minimise future work.
B9
Reduce drainage blockages
1) Minimise use of combined kerb/drainage units.
2) Litter traps/netting at culverts.
3) Plant trees away from drainage pipes to reduce damage by roots.
4) Consider the minimum acceptable size of culvert if access will be
required in future.
B10
Ease erection, placement and subsequent maintenance of temporary
signs
Provide sockets to locate posts e.g. in concrete central reserve barrier.

Structures
1) In considering choice between use of weathering steel and paint
systems (both standard and longer life systems) ensure account is
taken of working life costs and maintenance requirements for each
approach and their associated maintenance safety implications.
2) Consider the use of corrosion resistant rebar to eliminate future
corrosion / spalling.
3) Increase cover to maximum permitted by standards.
4) Remove joints from string courses to remove use of joint sealants
over live running lanes.

Table NI/A.1 TYPE A: ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE (ELIMINATE THE HAZARD / AVOID THE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY THROUGH
BETTER OR ALTERNATIVE DESIGN)
No
GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
A1
Relocation of features
1) Move sign positions away from trees or vice versa, either longitudinally or
transversely
2) Consider placing lighting columns in verge to facilitate lantern changes.
3) Consider placing lighting columns on approaches to under bridges rather
than on the bridge to remove the need to access them from the over bridge
itself.
4) Locate access to bridge interiors such that operatives can avoid live
carriageways (i.e. no access to manholes in carriageways).
A2
Consider alternative drainage designs
1) Use of vegetated drainage systems rather than buried "hard solutions that
need regular or frequent maintenance (e.g. interceptors).
2) Cross carriageway drains can be difficult to maintain and repair in addition
to contributing to pavement failure if damaged. Avoid the use of offside
gullies.
3) Use of semi-bound filter drain material to reduce stone scatter problems
from filter drains close to running lanes.
4) Avoid manhole covers within running lanes and hard shoulders / hard strip.
5) Provide overflow pipes to spillage ponds to prevent filling up with surface
water runoff resulting in need to regularly drain ponds.
A3
Eliminate need for any on-going work
1) Use materials for roadside features that have low maintenance
requirements thereby reducing the need for maintenance or replacement.
2) Design out roadside features and equipment thereby eliminating the need
to undertake maintenance work.
3) Use of non self-seeding variety trees.
4) No planting located within visibility splays.
A4
Edge line road studs placed on non-trafficked side of lines

Ref
GENERAL METHOD
TYPICAL EXAMPLE
B1
Reduce amount of grass cutting
1) Use low growth species.
2) Harden central reserves to reduce grass cutting and litter picking.
B2
Reduce time exposure
Simplify tasks and methods e.g. design of gullies compatible with
common plant used to clean and empty gullies.
B3
Provide sign bins
Stock with commonly needed signs.
B4
Reduce manual handling effort during construction and maintenance
1) Give requirements for kerbs that do not unnecessarily restrict a
constructor's choice of construction methods and their ability to meet
their H&S obligations.
2) Fixed location of flapped or remotely operated TM signs.
3) Avoid over specifying manhole covers in non-trafficable areas, also
allow flat area to place lifted covers.
4) Specify requirements for components in performance terms to enable
constructors to use components made of lightweight materials e.g. in
the provision of fence panels and paving slabs.
B5
Reduce need for crash repair
1) At sign post locations in addition to consideration of whole life cost of
the options of road restraint protected posts and passively safe posts
with no restraint the relative maintenance safety issues should also
be considered.
2) Use socketed posts for signs or safety barriers that are likely to be
damaged often or could be difficult to access to repair e.g., where
safety barriers are founded in concrete or driven through hardened
surfaces, a sleeve may assist speed of repair. Repair databases
would assist identification of high risk locations.
B6
Co-locate features at locations where maintenance is safe and
convenient
Weather stations, control and power cabinets.

B7
Increase life of assets
1) In choosing design lives for components ensure that safety risks of
in-service replacement of signs has been adequately taken into
account.
2) Lift metal objects from ground using plinths /platforms (if no driver
hazard created) to reduce corrosion risks.
3) Consider the use of sign face treatments that reduce the need for in
service maintenance interventions.
4) Prior to installation on site off site running of technology (soak testing)
prone to early life failure to minimise the need for in-situ repair or
replacement.
B8
Provide permanent crossover locations
1) Consider constructing central reserve crossovers on new roads for
future use.
2) If no crossover to be provided at outset, consider instead providing
minimal equipment in central reserve to minimise future work.
B9
Reduce drainage blockages
1) Minimise use of combined kerb/drainage units.
2) Litter traps/netting at culverts.
3) Plant trees away from drainage pipes to reduce damage by roots.
4) Consider the minimum acceptable size of culvert if access will be
required in future.
B10
Ease erection, placement and subsequent maintenance of temporary
signs
Provide sockets to locate posts e.g. in concrete central reserve barrier.
