2. Overarching principles of environmental asses...
2.
Overarching principles of environmental assessment
2.1
Environmental assessment shall provide clear, concise information to support the competent authority
in reaching a reasoned conclusion on the likely effects of a project on the environment.
2.2
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) must be based on current knowledge and established
methods of assessment, in accordance with the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N].
2.3
Non-statutory environmental assessment information shall be based on current knowledge and
established methods of assessment.
2.3.1
Environmental assessment should be proportionate to the scale and stage of a project.
NOTE
The prediction of likely significant effects does not require absolute certainty (further information is
provided within LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
2.4
EIAs must ensure effective participation of the public concerned in the decision making procedures, in
accordance with the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N].
2.5
Non-statutory environmental assessments shall ensure effective participation of the public concerned in
the decision-making procedures.
2.6
EIAs must be based on a description of the project proposed to be constructed, in accordance with the
EIA Directive [Ref 4.N].
2.6.1
Prior to the submission of project documentation to the competent authority for consent, the following
items should be reviewed for consistency across all reports:
1) project objectives (including any environmental objectives);
2) environmental assessment assumptions;
3) project design parameters (including any specific environmental design measures); and
4) environmental assessment conclusions.
2.7
Non-statutory environmental assessments shall be based on a description of the physical
characteristics of the project proposed to be constructed.
2.7.1
Environmental assessment should be an iterative process that informs options, design / mitigation
decisions, transport appraisal and procedures associated with environmental legislation separate from
the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N].
2.8
Environmental assessment conclusions shall provide the evidence for the development and
implementation of proportionate environmental management, mitigation and monitoring measures.
2.8.1
Before commencement of construction activities, the conclusions of the project environmental
assessment should be reviewed to ensure that they still reflect the scheme being constructed.
NOTE
Material changes to the project after the consent has been obtained can influence the reported
conclusions in the environmental assessment.
2.9
Where additional assessments are required beyond those under the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N], e.g. the
Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC [Ref 1.N] or the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC [Ref 3.N], project teams
must include information within scoping reports on coordinated or joint:
1) survey proposals; and
2) reporting.
2.10
The specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation covering the relevant national regulations
shall apply.
Environmental Impact Assessment
2.11
Where a project is listed in Annex I of the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N], Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) must be undertaken.

2. Overarching principles of environmental asses...
2.12
Where a project falls under Annex II of the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N] and is likely to have significant
environmental effects (having regard to the selection criteria in Annex III of the EIA Directive), EIA must
be undertaken.
2.12.1
The specific screening procedures of the Overseeing Organisation should apply when undertaking EIA.
NOTE
Further guidance on EIA screening and assessment is provided in LA 102 [Ref 2.I] Screening projects
for Environmental Impact Assessment; and LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
Non-statutory environmental assessment
2.13
Where screening concludes that EIA is not required, a proportionate level of environmental assessment
shall be undertaken to inform non-statutory reporting in accordance with LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental
assessment and Monitoring.
2.14
The specific reporting requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall apply when undertaking
non-statutory environmental assessment.
Expertise
2.15
Environmental Statements (ES), produced under the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N], must be prepared by a
competent expert(s).
2.16
ES technical chapters shall be prepared by lead individuals who are competent experts.
2.17
Screening requests, scoping reports and non-statutory environmental assessment reports shall be
prepared by competent experts.
2.18
Statements providing evidence of how individuals meet the definition of competent expert shall be
provided within ES's, screening requests, scoping reports and non-statutory environmental assessment
reports.
Environmental objectives
2.19
Environmental objectives provide a mechanism for supporting improved environmental performance
and shall be reported within ES's, screening requests, scoping reports and non-statutory environmental
assessment reports.
2.19.1
Opportunities to deliver improved environmental performance (including enhancements) should be
captured within environmental objectives.
NOTE
Early identification of environmental objectives increases the likelihood of achieving improved
environmental performance by informing options / design choice and decision-making.
2.19.2
Project objectives and environmental objectives should deliver improved environmental performance
by being linked and informed by wider legislative, regulatory or strategic requirements.
2.20
The specific environmental objective reporting requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall apply.

3. Levels of environmental assessment
3.
Levels of environmental assessment
3.1
Projects shall employ, where relevant, the following non-sequential assessment levels on projects;
1) scoping;
2) screening;
3) simple assessment;
4) detailed assessment; and
5) monitoring.
NOTE 1
Environmental assessment levels are not always sequential, e.g. scoping of the project options takes
place prior to screening the preferred option. Scoping of the preferred option is refined to focus the
environmental assessment on those factors which need to be reported in further detail.
NOTE 2
Not all levels of environmental assessment are required for a project e.g. detailed assessment can be
undertaken without having undertaken simple assessment, where likely significant effects have been
identified during scoping.
Scoping
3.2
Scoping shall be undertaken in accordance with LA 103 [Ref 6.N] Scoping projects for Environmental
Assessment.
NOTE
Scoping provides justification and evidence for:
1) further assessment (or not) of environmental factors;
2) the level of assessment to be undertaken;
3) the approach to consultation; and
4) the environmental assessment methodologies / study areas.
Screening
3.3
Screening must be undertaken in accordance with the EIA Directive [Ref 4.N].
Simple assessment
3.4
Simple assessment shall be undertaken where:
1) there remains a sufficient level of uncertainty over likely significant environmental effects; and
2) further evidence is required to support environmental assessment following scoping.
NOTE 1
The objective of simple assessment is to apply a proportionate approach in supporting assessment
conclusions, demonstrating legal compliance and informing design, mitigation and monitoring (where
relevant).
NOTE 2
Simple assessment is typically based on readily available information, walkover surveys and targeted
consultation with environmental bodies.
3.5
Simple assessment shall be undertaken in accordance with the methodology and reporting
requirements set out in LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
3.6
Detailed assessment shall be undertaken where:
1) scoping, screening and / or simple assessment identify likely significant environmental effects; and
2) further assessment is required to sufficiently inform and support the decision-making process.
NOTE
Detailed assessment typically comprises quantified modelling, assessment monitoring, detailed field
surveys and consultation with environmental bodies and other interested / affected stakeholders.
3.7
Detailed assessment shall be undertaken in accordance with the methodology and reporting
requirements set out in LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental assessment and monitoring.

LA 101 Revision 0
3. Levels of environmental assessment
NOTE 1
ES's and non-statutory environmental assessment reports can contain simple assessment for some
factors and detailed assessments for other factors, depending on the complexity of issues requiring
assessment.
NOTE 2
Within ES's and non-statutory environmental assessment reports not all elements (parts of factors) are
scoped in e.g. visual impacts can be assessed without assessing landscape impacts.
Monitoring
3.8
Where significant adverse environmental effects are reported in ES's, monitoring of these effects shall
be undertaken in accordance with LA 104 [Ref 1.I] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
NOTE
The purpose of monitoring is to:
1) ensure measures envisaged to avoid, prevent or reduce and, if possible, offset significant adverse
effects on the environment are delivered;
2) build data on the effectiveness of design and mitigation measures thereby driving improvement in
environmental performance for future projects;
3) satisfy licence / permit requirements (where applicable); and
4) identify remedial action as a consequence of under-performance or failure of mitigation.
