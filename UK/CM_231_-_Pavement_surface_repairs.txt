Publishing information
This document is published by National Highways.
This document, together with CD 227 [Ref 3.N], supersedes parts of HD 31/94 and HD 32/16, which
are withdrawn.
This document provides requirements and advice to develop the design outputs to deliver local repairs
to road pavement surfaces in accordance with CC 204 [Ref 8.N] 'Pavement surface treatments', CC
205 [Ref 6.N] 'Maintenance of pavements with an asphalt surfacing', and CC 206 [Ref 5.N]
'Maintenance of concrete pavement layers'.
Contractual and legal considerations
This document forms part of the works specification. It does not purport to include all the necessary
provisions of a contract. Users are responsible for applying all appropriate documents applicable to
their contract.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
The timely repair of small localised pavement defects plays an important part in providing safe roads
and reliable journeys for the road user. Maintenance is required to protect the integrity of the overall
pavement structure and to ensure the safety of the road user. Depending on the environmental
conditions, including traffic loading and the type of road pavement, an untreated defect can deteriorate
quickly and present a hazard to road users.
This document provides requirements and associated advice on permitted techniques for local repairs
of both flexible and rigid pavements.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 4.N].

Local repairs to asphalt surfaces
Techniques and materials for local repairs to asphalt surfaces
2.1
The local repair area shall be determined based on the following:
1)
the perimeter of the local repair extending at least 250 mm from beyond the edge of any defect;
2)
shape being rectangular or round; and,
3)
longitudinal joints being situated outside of the wheel track zones;
2.1.1
Local repairs to asphalt surfaces may be grouped into larger patches for efficient delivery.
2.2
Repairs greater than 5 m2 in area shall be paver-laid patch repairs.
2.3
Paver-laid patch repairs to surface courses shall be minimum 15 m in length by full lane widths.
2.4
Paver-laid patch repairs to base and binder courses shall be minimum 5 m in length by full lane widths.
2.5
Repair techniques for local repairs to asphalt surfaces ≤5 m2 in area shall be selected from the
following:
1)
inset patch repairs; or,
2)
infra-red thermal repairs.
NOTE
Infra-red thermal repairs use a combination of the existing material and proprietary blends of additional
constituents to meet performance requirements. The permitted local repair material and thicknesses,
and the PSV and AAV do not need to be detailed when infra-red thermal repairs are selected as the
performance requirements are covered by CC 205 [Ref 6.N].
2.6
For inset patch repairs and paver-laid patch repairs, the surface course shall be selected from one or
more of the options in table 2.6.

1)
designed asphalt concrete binder course;
2)
stone mastic asphalt binder course; and,
3)
performance hot rolled asphalt binder course.
NOTE
Replacement of the binder course and surface course at detector loop locations can improve the
longevity of the repair.
2.8
The base course for inset patch repairs and paver-laid patch repairs shall be designed asphalt concrete
base course.

2.10
Local repairs to emergency areas (EAs) shall be surfaced with one of the following:
1)
emergency area surface treatment; or
2)
coloured TSCS for maintenance.
2.11
The design thickness for each pavement course shall be detailed.
2.12
The design thickness for inset patch repairs to surface courses shall be at least the full depth of the
existing surface course.
2.13
The minimum PSV for surface course shall be determined in accordance with CD 236 [Ref 9.N].
2.14
The maximum AAV for surface course shall be determined in accordance with CD 236 [Ref 9.N].
2.15
The design of crack sealing treatments to flexible pavement layers shall be in accordance with CD 227
[Ref 3.N].
2.16
Where bituminous mixtures other than thin surface course systems are not to be installed in accordance
with BS 594987 [Ref 1.N], the installation instructions for the bituminous mixtures shall be detailed.
2.16.1
Only the deviations from the requirements in BS 594987 [Ref 1.N] may be detailed for simplicity.
NOTE
An example of a deviation from the requirements in BS 594987 [Ref 1.N] that can be more practicable
for local repairs is hand spraying of bond/tack coat instead of machine spraying of bond coat.
