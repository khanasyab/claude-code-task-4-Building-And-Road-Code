Foreword
This document provides specifier instructions for the production of the works specific requirements for
CC 402 Temporary vehicle restraint systems.
This document does not form part of the works specification.
The works specification is made up of both the Specification for Highway Works and the works specific
requirements completed by the Specifier.
This document is applicable for contracts throughout the UK, complemented by the additional
specification requirements and contractual changes of each Overseeing Organisation.
Users are responsible for applying all appropriate documents applicable to their contract.
Users are responsible for archiving contract documentation in accordance with the user's quality
management system.
