Introduction
Introduction
Background
Bridges can fail assessment calculation even when they seem to be carrying normal traffic satisfactorily
without any undue signs of distress. Load tests can provide additional information which can justify
increasing the assessed capacity.
This document explains the rationale behind load testing of bridges.
This document was derived from BA 54/94. It has been edited to reduce ambiguity and repetition, to
clarify distinctions between requirements and background information and to improve ease of use by
simplifying the text and by rearranging the document in a more logical order.
Additional emphasis has been placed on the need to appropriately manage health and safety issues
which may be different for different types of test; including the need to recognise that bridge collapse is
an unavoidable risk during proving load tests but cannot be entirely discounted during supplementary
tests.
The technical content is otherwise unchanged.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

2. Application of load testing
2.
Application of load testing
Purpose
2.1
Load testing of a bridge shall only be undertaken after calculated assessments using the best available
methods and information (such as results of material tests, recorded information on similar bridges and
materials, maintenance and strengthening records) fail to show it to comply with the assessment
standards.
2.1.1
Load tests may be employed to provide information to supplement reliability analysis.
Applicability
2.2
Load testing shall only be used if analysis shows that there is a realistic possibility of improving the
assessed capacity to a level which can satisfy the assessment standards.
2.2.1
Load testing may assist in bridge assessment to bridge types which contain features where hidden
strength reserves can be found, or where it is expected to identify additional sources of strength not
normally taken into account in the calculations.
2.2.2
Although not intended to be exhaustive, the following is a list of bridge types for which load testing may
be usefully employed:
1) small span bridges where either a single-axle or a two-axle bogie could simulate assessment
loading;
2) older bridges, of construction types now mainly unused, for which structural idealisation is
particularly difficult;
3) in general, bridges without internal structural complexities such as transverse girders (although such
complexities by themselves do not mean that all types of tests are pointless);
4) in general, bridges which, at least theoretically, can be termed as simply-supported;
5) bridges where the strength of constituent parts is uncertain owing to lack of design data or
knowledge of physical condition.
Constraints
2.3
Where bridges are suspected of having inadequate shear capacity, additional caution shall be used in
tests.
NOTE
Particular requirements for such tests are provided within the parts of this document that describe the
different types of load tests.
2.4
Load test procedures shall be devised individually for each bridge assessment.
Types of load tests
2.5
Bridge load tests described in this document shall either be classified as supplementary load tests or as
proving load tests.
NOTE 1
Supplementary load tests are intended to be used as an adjunct to theoretical calculations.
NOTE 2
Proving load tests are intended to be used as a complete assessment in place of a theoretical
assessment when the assessing engineer suspects that the theoretical assessment has
underestimated the actual load capacity of a bridge.
Management
2.6
Testing shall be carried out under the supervision of a Chartered Engineer with specialist expertise in
bridge strength assessment or design.
2.7
Testing shall be undertaken by a competent organisation in possession of the necessary equipment.
2.8
Specialist expertise shall be employed in devising a load test, during the test itself and in the
subsequent assessment, especially in deciding the reduction factors relating to earlier collapse tests.

3. Supplementary load tests
3.
Supplementary load tests
Objectives of supplementary tests
3.1
In a supplementary load test, vehicle axle loads or patch loads, or combinations thereof, shall be
placed on a bridge to determine individual aspects of its behaviour so that assumptions made in the
theoretical assessment can be made more pertinent to the individual structure.
NOTE 1
Appendix A summarises a typical supplementary test procedure.
NOTE 2
Detailed guidelines for conducting supplementary load tests have been published: e.g. Guidelines for
the supplementary load testing of bridges [Ref 1.I].
Test loads
3.2
Load tests shall not cause damage to the bridge.
3.3
Estimates of day to day loading shall be obtained from records or surveys.
3.4
The loads applied in the tests shall not cause effects which exceed those caused by the loads carried
by the bridge on a day to day basis.
3.4.1
It is recommended that the test load effects on older bridges should not exceed the original design
working load.
3.5
Test load effects in composite bridges shall not exceed 60% of the unfactored serviceability limit state
load effects.
NOTE
This limit is to minimise the probability of accidentally damaging the shear connection between
concrete and steel elements.
3.6
Test load effects on other bridges shall not exceed 90% of the unfactored serviceability limit state load
effects.
3.7
Load effects in bending tests shall be kept well within the elastic range of the bridge flexural behaviour.
3.8
Load levels in shear tests shall be limited to below the predicted lowest theoretical strength because
shear failure can be relatively sudden.
Management of supplementary tests
3.9
Where there is a risk of sudden failure including inadequacy in respect of shear strength, load testing
shall only be undertaken if:
1) load levels are kept sufficiently low to ensure that the risk of sudden failure is effectively removed;
2) the load test does not take place over an open route or place;
3) structural failure would not endanger staff engaged in undertaking the test or any other persons.
3.10
The possibility that the bridge will suffer severe damage or collapse is a potential hazard during any
test, and the consequential risk to personnel shall be mitigated in accordance with health and safety
regulations.
NOTE
Excessive shear loading can lead to a brittle and therefore relatively unsafe failure mode.
3.11
A test vehicle shall not be deliberately mounted on any element (such as the footway) which was not
originally designed to such loads.
Analysis and assessment
3.12
Extrapolation to the behaviour at the ultimate limit state from the results of tests carried out with levels
of loading lower than or equal to the serviceability limit state shall only be undertaken if two conditions
are satisfied, as follows:
1) the materials and their interconnections are determinable;

some pattern of load carrying behaviour has been established.

4. Proving load tests
4.
Proving load tests
Objectives of proving load tests
4.1
A proving load test shall be used as a complete assessment by itself in place of the theoretical
assessment.
NOTE
A proving load test is not intended to improve assumptions employed in bridge assessment.
4.2
Proving load tests shall be limited to bridges which, on the basis of their assessments, could have been
closed to traffic and could otherwise require to be demolished.
Test loads
4.3
Proving tests shall not be employed if the relationship between a test load and a subsequently
permissible service loading cannot be determined.
4.4
A test load representing the ultimate limit state level of the assessment live load (ALL), or a reduced
proportion of it, shall be applied to a bridge.
4.5
The test load shall be applied in increments until either the entire load is reached or until the load
deflection behaviour becomes non-linear.
NOTE
The test load is not likely to be sufficient to develop non-linear behaviour where the failure mode is
brittle in nature (e.g. in a shear load test). Therefore, in such cases, the second criterion listed above
will not be applicable.
Management of proving load tests
4.6
The possibility that the bridge will suffer severe damage or collapse is a significant and unavoidable
hazard during a proving test, and the consequential risk to personnel shall be mitigated in accordance
with health and safety regulations.
4.7
The bridge and any area beneath the bridge which can be affected in the event of bridge collapse shall
be closed to all persons while a proving load test is taking place.
Analysis and assessment
4.8
In order to obtain the allowable load, the maximum achieved test load shall be divided first by a factor
to allow for the fact that a simplified model load is used to represent the complete ALL and, secondly,
by the partial safety factor for the ALL appropriate at the ultimate limit state to obtain the nominal
assessment load level.
4.9
Appropriate partial safety factors shall be obtained by referring to CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
4.10
Weight restriction levels, if any, shall be decided from the allowable load detailed in this section and in
accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
4.11
Bridges that have been subjected to proving load tests shall be thoroughly inspected and reassessed at
frequent intervals after the test because any structural damage incurred during proving load tests can
initially be concealed.
NOTE
Any internal damage can lead to rapidly accelerated subsequent deterioration of the structure and can
cause sudden collapse under permitted traffic.

A1
Typical supplementary load test instructions
One or more test loads may be placed at various positions on the bridge.
The test load may comprise an axle or a bogie or a vehicle load, or it can comprise some form of ballast
(e.g. water tank load).
The test load is designed to generate particular live load effects (for example, the bending moments
produced by the assessment live loading).
The loading is to be applied in increments.
The observed strains and deflections can then be compared with corresponding theoretical values.
When this comparison indicates hidden reserve capacity in the bridge, each possible source of the
hidden strength such as end fixity, better transverse distribution and composite action can be examined
using knowledge gained in earlier collapse tests on similar bridges, where available.
When the hidden strength indicated by the test or a proportion of it can be accounted for and is justified
then:
1) the theoretical model can be modified;
2) the assessment calculations can be carried out using the revised model.
