Introduction
Introduction
Background
The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 ( CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N]) made under Section
15 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 ( HASAWA 1974 [Ref 4.N]), and in particular
Regulation 4 (the duty to manage asbestos) applies to all non-domestic premises. 'L143 Managing and
working with asbestos CAR 12 Approved Code of Practice' ( CAR L143 [Ref 4.I]) gives practical advice
on how to comply with those requirements. HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] (Asbestos – The Survey Guide) provides
guidance on the identification and management of asbestos in non-domestic premises. This document
contains requirements and advice on the application of Regulation 4 to all highway assets. The
Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (amended 2006) SI 1999/3242 [Ref 8.N]
Regulation 4 (schedule 1) requires the principles of prevention to be applied.
Asbestos containing materials (ACMs) are known to exist within the highway boundary, in roads,
drainage, structures, associated buildings, fill/soil and other assets. Road tunnels, depots and toilet
blocks are considered to pose the highest risk for highway works. ACMs only pose a risk to health if the
material has deteriorated or is disturbed and the fibres become airborne and can then be inhaled.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Asbestos surveys
Introduction
3.1
Asbestos surveying and laboratory testing organisations shall be accredited to ISO/IEC 17020 [Ref
6.N] and ISO/IEC 17025 [Ref 3.N] respectively (by UKAS or equivalent).
NOTE 1
The HSE guidance on asbestos surveys is available in HSG 264 [Ref 2.I]. It has implications for both
those undertaking asbestos surveys and for dutyholders.
NOTE 2
HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] describes the two types of survey – management survey and refurbishment and
demolition survey.
NOTE 3
HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] emphasises the need to plan surveys effectively and provide information to those
who are undertaking the survey works.
3.2
Prior to commissioning the survey, the dutyholder shall check the competency of the
surveyor/laboratory as per the requirements in 3.1.
3.2.1
The survey types set out in Table 3.2.1 should be carried out as detailed in the AAMP, AAP or SAMP.

GG 105 Revision 0
3. Asbestos surveys
3.3
Collecting and analysing samples to identify the presence of asbestos shall be carried out where
appropriate.
NOTE 1
Identifying the appropriateness of taking, collecting and analysing samples can be achieved through
the risk assessment process.
NOTE 2
Work associated with collecting and analysing samples to identify the presence of asbestos does not
normally require a licence. However, Regulation 2 and Regulation 8 of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref
2.N] apply.
3.4
Asbestos survey activities shall take maximum advantage of planned activities required for other works
for the asset such as geotechnical investigations, routine maintenance, bridge inspections and other
work streams.
3.4.1
Assessment of the soil/fill suspected of being contaminated with asbestos may involve sampling and
analysis of the soil/fill.
NOTE
A risk-based approach can be used to identify the likelihood of the soil/fill containing asbestos
materials. Imported fill material has a greater likelihood of being contaminated.
3.5
Any caveats shall be agreed with the dutyholder before the survey commences.
3.6
Caveats shall be avoided where possible as they reduce the effectiveness of the survey and may have
implications for managing asbestos.
NOTE
Guidance for completing the survey report is given in HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] – Survey Reports.
Management surveys
3.7
The dutyholder shall carry out management surveys on all assets in compliance with HSG 264 [Ref 2.I].
3.8
Significant maintenance or improvements shall require a refurbishment survey.
NOTE 1
The purpose of a management survey is to identify and manage any asbestos containing materials
(ACMs) during normal occupation and use of the asset, ensuring that they do not harm those in the
premises, that ACMs remain in good condition and are not disturbed accidentally.
NOTE 2
Guidance on completing the management survey is given in HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] – Types of Survey.
3.8.1
It may be decided to undertake targeted sampling as part of the management survey to ascertain
whether materials contain asbestos.
NOTE
A management survey can be completed using a combination of sampling ACMs and presuming ACMs.
3.9
In the case of hidden assets, these shall be presumed to contain asbestos unless there is definitive
evidence to the contrary and duly noted in the AMP.
NOTE
Examples of hidden assets are underground drainage pipework or materials hidden within the asset,
such as deck waterproofing.
Refurbishment and demolition survey
3.10
A refurbishment and demolition survey shall be carried out to comply with HSG 264 [Ref 2.I] before any
refurbishment, demolition or intrusive work is carried out.
NOTE
A refurbishment and demolition survey is used to locate and describe, so far as is reasonably
practicable, all ACMs in the area where the refurbishment work is to take place or in the whole asset if
demolition is planned.
3.11
The refurbishment and demolition survey shall be fully intrusive and involve destructive inspection to
gain access to all areas, including those difficult to reach.
Asbestos contaminated soil
3.12
Soil/fill suspected of being contaminated with asbestos shall be assessed.

======================================================================
GG 105 Revision 0
3. Asbestos surveys
3.12.1
Assessment of contaminated land may involve sampling and analysis of the soil/fill.
NOTE 1
Guidance for completing a soil assessment is given in CAR-SOIL [Ref 3.I] (available from CL:AIRE
website https://www.claire.co.uk/) Control of Asbestos Regulations - Interpretation for managing and
working with asbestos in soil and construction and demolition materials: Industry guidance.
NOTE 2
The historic widespread use of asbestos containing materials (ACMs) means that where soil can be
described either partly or wholly as made ground or fill material, there is the potential for contamination
with ACMs and for asbestos fibres to become airborne during ground disturbance. In addition to made
or contaminated ground there are a number of naturally occurring deposits of asbestos bearing rock to
be found in the UK.
Records - AAP database upload requirements
3.13
In accordance with CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N], survey reports must be accessible so that
stakeholders minimise the health risk from exposure to asbestos fibres.
3.14
The dutyholder must, in accordance with CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N], ensure that information,
which can include survey reports, about the location and condition of any ACM is made available to
every person liable to disturb it.
3.14.1
The asset management database relevant to that particular asset should be used for ease of access,
and information uploaded to the database (which can include bespoke asbestos risk registers) when
new data is available, particularly where an ACM is known or presumed present.

GG 105 Revision 0
Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Highways England specific requirements for the management
processes and means of meeting legal requirements for asbestos management in trunk road assets.
Highways England, service providers and major projects providers are responsible for delivering the
actions for Highways England to meet its responsibilities.
Where the Highways England network is controlled under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI), Design,
Build, Finance and Operate Company (DBFO), or Private Project Provider (PPP), it is it's responsibility
to fulfil obligations of the dutyholder.
Highways England Traffic Technology Division (TTD) has it's own arrangements and is governed by the
Technology National Asbestos Management Plan (TNAMP). The Technology Performance
Management System (TPMS) has generated a management procedure in relation to asbestos risk
within TTD assets that fall within that the scope of the TNAMP.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
Relationship of this document to other Highways England documents
Highways England has adopted a suite approach to the management of ACMs in all assets owned or
managed by Highways England. However this National Application Annex relates only to assets on the
strategic road network and associated infrastructure. The management system outlined in this
document does not supersede any of the requirements in other Health and Safety legislation.

Assets excluded
Building type assets on the Highways England estate
E/1.1
All assets managed by Highways England shall have an asbestos asset management strategy.
E/1.1.1
The following asset's asbestos asset management strategies should be carried out by the dutyholder
as defined in CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] where they are not the responsibility of Highways
England (HE):
1) buildings on the HE estate which house HE staff (for which the business services estates team and
PFM are responsible);
2) other HE property and assets not maintained by provider organisations such as motorway service
areas where the duty to manage asbestos is delegated to the leaseholder;
3) assets provided or maintained under specific contracts where HE is not the dutyholder. The term
"dutyholder" is defined in CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] Regulation 4.
NOTE
There are lands and property owned and maintained by Highways England as a result of past or future
road schemes. Such assets are managed separately by MPD through their national property
management and disposal (PMD) team which are subject to separate asbestos management plans –
property usually acquired under blight provisions.
Other properties managed by a third party
E/1.2
Where Highways England or the Highways England dutyholder is aware that ACMs have the potential
to be disturbed by maintenance, improvement, or demolition activities, information shall be passed to
the building manager or dutyholder prior to any invasive activity being undertaken.
NOTE 1
Other properties managed by a third party include police control centres and Traffic Control Centres
(TCCs) where Highways England is not the primary asset owner and/or the dutyholder.
NOTE 2
Properties managed by third parties are independent of Highways England and are either owned or
managed by others. These properties can include equipment or infrastructure that is managed by
Highways England or Highways England service providers.

GG 105 Revision 0
E/4. AAP production and dissemination
NOTE
The purpose of the risk register is to identify ACM, or presumed ACM, and to alert all persons working
on and around the assets as to when these materials could be affected by any work carried out on the
assets.
E/4.26.2
The risk register should contain three sections down the sheet comprising:
1) those asset elements which have been confirmed as ACM through survey, testing and assessment
or known following prior work on the assets;
2) those elements which are presumed to be ACM because they are hidden or buried in the asset and
have not been subject to testing and assessment;
3) those elements which are presumed not to contain ACM by virtue of age or their engineering
material characteristics. This section also will include those components proved not to contain
asbestos following sampling and testing.
E/4.26.3
The risk register should contain three sections across the sheet for each asset element:
1) the element description, location and other defining details;
2) the summary of survey, sampling, testing and assessment results, or reasons for presuming ACM,
or reasons for assuming no ACM by nature of the material;
3) the actions to be carried out in respect of known ACM or presumed ACM. Actions are to be be
graded A, B, C or D. (See below in clause E/6.29.1).
E/4.26.4
The risk register should include summary details only.
E/4.26.5
The full details should be included in the report from the asbestos surveyor and/or testing house.
E/4.27
The risk register shall be updated by inclusion of information gained following further sampling, testing
and assessment prior to maintenance or construction work and any changes to elements as a result of
that work, including:
1) replacement of waterproofing containing asbestos;
2) replacement of broken asbestos cement roofing sheeting;
3) repair of damage to asbestos cement electrical ducts/chambers;
4) replacing damaged asbestos insulation board in buildings; and
5) demolition of assets and rebuilding under major widening schemes.
E/4.28
Actions shown on the register are those necessary as a result of the risk assessment process and
indicate the level of remedial work necessary which shall be carried out to ensure all persons are not
accidentally exposed to airborne asbestos fibres which could be inhaled.
1) action level A: no action necessary - indicates those materials or asset elements which are known
not to contain asbestos as a result of a direct test, or presumed to be non ACM because of age or
constituent material. More detail can be found in HSG 264 [Ref 1.I];
2) action level B: monitor and manage - indicates ACMs which as a result of the survey and
assessment process have a low score and are permitted to be left in place and managed. This
includes materials which were not investigated in the survey because they were hidden, buried and
not likely to be disturbed during most work activities;
3) action level C: immediate interventions indicates known - ACMs which as a result of assessment are
in a condition which requires repair, sealing, covering or other means of encapsulation to prevent
fibre release. When work has been carried out to these elements they can be regraded to action
level A or B in the register;
4) action level D: immediate removal - indicates known ACMs which as a result of assessment are in a
condition such that the material has to be removed and replaced with non-ACM.
General Items (to be included in all AAPs)

and Rivers Trust, other navigation authorities, private bridge owners and other companies, such as
Traffic manager.
General
E/9.2
The processes set out for emergency services, utility companies and other third parties as set out in
this section shall apply to each category of third party.
NOTE
It is anticipated that, in time, all third parties are likely to develop reciprocal arrangements with
Highways England in line with 'duty to manage' responsibilities. These include a duty to co-operate with
other dutyholders for shared or adjacent premises and infrastructure.
Emergency services
E/9.3
ACM information must be passed to the emergency services, particularly Fire and Rescue, for a
route/section on a summary basis in accordance with CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] paragraph
4-9c.
NOTE
Passing of individual AAP copies to the Fire and Rescue service is unlikely to be appropriate, owing to
the volume of paperwork involved.
E/9.3.1
The ACM summary should contain only those items which would prove to be a problem in the event of
a road traffic accident or fire.
NOTE
Examples would include ACMs in: cladding, deck soffit formwork to structures, waterproofing (deck
surface fire), highway ducts (close to surface) and cable troughs (on or close to the surface).
E/9.4
Discussion shall be held with emergency services (fire particularly) to ascertain format/level of
information required on a local basis.
E/9.5
The sharing of information with emergency services must be in accordance with Regulation 4-9c of
CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N].

Utility companies should hold 'asbestos management plans', and make the information available as per
the requirements of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] regulation 4.
E/9.7
If notice is served on a utility company in advance of works, any asbestos-related information shall be
included in the company's responses as per CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] regulation 4-2.
E/9.8
If works are then to be carried out for diversion and alteration as part of the scheme, the AAP risk
register information shall be made available to all parties involved with undertaking the works prior to
work commencing on site.
E/9.9
Responses to the utility company shall include AAP risk register information using the relevant AAP risk
register information (this process also applies if the utility company serves notice in advance of a
proposed utility scheme).

E/9. Process for dealing with third parties
All other third parties
E/9.10
Where Highways England owns a highway structure, but not the asset component carried by that
highway structure, there must be an exchange of AAP information in advance of works being
undertaken on site as per Regulation 4 CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N].
E/9.11
Information exchange shall include nil returns where no asbestos has been identified (or potentially
identified) and is expected to take place at first notification of works to be carried out.
NOTE
An example would be resurfacing of a local authority road over a Highways England highway structure.
E/9.12
Where the highway is carried by a structure owned by the third party, the dutyholder plan owner must
exchange all relevant information on receipt of the notice of any works from the third party in
accordance with the requirements of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] regulation 4-2 and 4-9c.
E/9.13
For non-highway assets the dutyholder plan owner must exchange all relevant information (as per
regulation 4 of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N]) on receipt of the notice of any works from the third
party to ensure that the required level of asbestos related information is made available to all other
contractors who could be carrying out work on Highways England assets.
E/9.14
Dutyholder plan owners must have processes in place for all buildings under their control in accordance
with Regulation 4 of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N].
E/9.15
Where AAPs are not in place, responsibility shall be determined for carrying out surveys.
E/9.15.1
Generally, survey work generated because of third party activity should be funded by the third party.

3) for each type of generic routine maintenance activity per area, or route within an area; copied to
individual AAPs only if required by activity affecting an ACM;
4) for each emergency works incident; copied to AAP if the incident affected an ACM;
5) for each principal inspection or other specialist work requiring intrusive testing or investigation work
to an asset; and
6) minor new/maintenance work (e.g. grass cutting, installation of sign posts on verges/central
reserves and replacement of vehicle restrain posts).
E/10.2
Where surveying and testing has not been conducted prior to work being carried out to an asset as per
Regulation 5 of CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N], the presumption must be made that asbestos is
present, especially for buried or hidden features, unless materials involved are categorically stated not
to contain asbestos.
E/10.3
The assumption that asbestos is present must be reﬂected in pre-construction Information (as defined
in CDM 2015 [Ref 1.N]) and appropriate measures taken including the sharing of information with
interested parties.
E/10.4
Each checklist shall apply for the life cycle of the scheme or maintenance activity.
E/10.5
When work is completed, the form shall be signed off and copied to the dutyholder plan owner.
E/10.6
The AAP shall be updated by changes to the asset risk register if required.
E/10.6.1
The checklist in Appendix E/G check list should be incorporated into providers' project management
systems, with modifications as necessary.

E/11.
Process for works following and emergency incident and/or fly
tipping
E/11.1
The process for works following an emergency incident and/or fly tipping shall apply to works
necessary after an emergency incident to all asset types.
NOTE
Incident can include collision, road traffic accident, fire, collapse or partial collapse of a structure,
embankment/cutting slips after bad weather, etc, where ACM are known to be present or suspected to
be present.
E/11.1.1
An emergency incident also applies to ﬂy tipping which may contain asbestos waste from building
materials and vehicles carrying waste involved in an incident.
E/11.2
Duty officers, 'incident support unit' (ISU) or maintenance provider representatives, in conjunction with
Highways England traffic officers, shall confirm that the emergency services have completed their work
and that all necessary general safety measures have been implemented.
E/11.3
Emergency services shall be consulted to establish if they are aware of any spread of dust which could
contain asbestos fibres.
E/11.4
Any safety measures shall be maintained in place by the AAP owner, in conjunction with maintenance
providers and emergency services.
E/11.5
All necessary paperwork shall be forwarded to the dutyholder plan owner, including consignment notes
and other details of material disposed of as hazardous waste.
E/11.5.1
If further work is needed to protect and/or repair the assets, then the work should be treated as planned
work and the process to establish the appropriate knowledge of ACMs is to be commenced prior to any
work being carried out.
E/11.6
Results of this process shall be fed into AAPs as required by other procedures/ﬂow charts, although it
is accepted that not all sections will apply.
E/11.7
As ﬂy tipping poses a risk, those representatives who are likely to come across waste on the network or
next to Highways England assets must assess whether there is a likelihood that because of the type of
material the risk of ACMs is present in accordance with CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] Regulation
5.
E/11.8
Where risk is evident specialist contractors shall be appointed to dispose of the ACMs safely.

Notes for each specific question/section of the check list (above)
General notes:
1) The checklist is only indicative and should be agreed with the dutyholder before the scheme
commences.
2) The checklist should include hold points for key work stages where it is appropriate to do so.
3) The checklist should be agreed and signed off by the dutyholder.
Q1. For the first few years of applying the asbestos management system, AAPs will not be in place
prior to identifying work programmes. However, it is the intention that AAPs will be prepared for all
assets prior to works being carried out CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] regulation 5.

Q2. This information will come from survey results in the AAP (when completed). If this is not available,
a presumption will be that hidden elements may contain asbestos unless strong evidence to the
contrary.
Q4. This applies to surveys and testing work specifically required in advance of identified work which
may disturb ACMs. This includes test on dust and debris to be removed prior to routine maintenance
on bearing shelves, etc.
Q5. This is to ensure that asbestos issues from the register are integrated into pre-construction
information and the CDM process.
Q6. Certain works on ACMs require notification to HSE 14 days prior to contractors carrying out work.
See HSG247 [Ref 4.I] and CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref 2.N] Regulation 9.
Q7. This is to ensure that asbestos issues are integrated into the CDM processes.
Q8. This is to ensure that asbestos issues are integrated into CDM processes.
Q10. Occasionally work may uncover ACMs which were totally unexpected. Contractors will be
prepared for this situation under their obligations as an employer under CAR 12 - SI 2012 No.632 [Ref
2.N].
Q14. AAPs should be updated by appending a copy of the completed check list where ACMs have
been affected or where new ACM information has come to light.
Q15. Where ACMs have been confirmed, sealed or removed as part of any works, the entry in the
appropriate Highways England database will be amended accordingly.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex outlines the implementation and management of DMRB document GG
105 'Asbestos management' in the trunk roads asset for Northern Ireland and should be read in
conjunction with the main body of the document. More detail is provided in Northern Ireland
Department for Infrastructure General Asbestos Management Plan (GAMP).
The Department for Infrastructure is the sole roads authority for Northern Ireland and thus is the asset
owner for all (adopted) roads within the province. The department's asbestos management strategy is
defined within its safety management procedures. These procedures discharge the obligations defined
in the Control of Asbestos Regulations (Northern Ireland) SI 2012/179 (NI) [Ref 6.N] and complement
other requirements and guidance such as; the Health and Safety at Work (NI) Order 1978 SI
1978/1039 (NI 9) [Ref 3.N], The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (NI) 2016 - CDM
(NI) 2016 [Ref 5.N], The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (NI) Regulations 2003 COSHH
(NI) [Ref 2.N] and HSG 264 [Ref 1.N] - Asbestos: The Survey Guide.
Further Information
If you have any queries regarding this Annex please contact Department for Infrastructure;
stephen.tweed@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk or dcu@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document

NI/1.
Special requirements: Department for Infrastructure
General asbestos management plan (GAMP)
NI/1.1
This document complements the GAMP and shall be read in conjunction with it.
NOTE
The Department's GAMP details strategy and arrangements for managing its responsibilities under The
Control of Asbestos Management Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 SI 2012/179 (NI) [Ref 6.N].
NI/1.2
All assets managed by the Department for Infrastructure shall have an asbestos asset management
strategy.
NI/1.3
The following assets' asbestos asset management strategies must be carried out by the dutyholder as
defined in SI 2012/179 (NI) [Ref 6.N] as they are not the responsibility of the Department for
Infrastructure:
1) the department's shared buildings where it is not the controlling authority; these assets are managed
through separate procedures by either the dutyholder's nominated premises management personnel
or facilities management branch;
2) any departmental buildings, whether shared or not, owned or controlled by a third party, unless the
department is explicitly defined as the dutyholder.
Hierarchy of asset review and management
NI/1.4
All assets for which the presence of asbestos containing material (ACM) is presumed or confirmed shall
be placed on a register.
NOTE
Assets for which the presence of ACM is presumed or confirmed assets are categorised according to
risk: high, medium and low.
NI/1.4.1
The risk categorisation of an asset should determine the priority for undertaking of the asbestos
surveys and development of the asbestos action plan (AAP).
NI/1.4.2
A strategic approach should be adopted in determining the presence of asbestos in the asset, as
detailed in the GAMP with the following considerations:
1) review of "as built" drawings and details to confirm the presence or absence of ACMs;
2) ACMs are assumed present within an asset unless there is evidence to attest ACMs are not present;
3) for assets where the department has not evidentially ruled out the presence of ACMs, and it is
advantageous to establish its presence/type/condition, an asbestos management survey will be
undertaken in accordance with guidance document HSG 264 [Ref 1.N] – 'Asbestos: The Survey
Guide'.
Surveys
NI/1.5
Where the asset is not classed as high risk, surveys shall be scheduled to complement maintenance
inspections, unless refurbishment or demolition work is planned.
NI/1.5.1
Where refurbishment or demolition work is planned, a refurbishment and demolition survey should be
carried out prior to work commencing.
NI/1.5.2
Asbestos surveys should be carried out as advised in Section 3 – 'Asbestos surveys' of DMRB
document GG 105.
NOTE
The initial asset review and subsequent risk classification determines the priority given to survey.
Asbestos register
NI/1.6
The Department for Infrastructure shall maintain an asbestos register for all its assets identified as
having ACMs (whether presumed or confirmed), excluding those which are managed by a third party.
NI/1.6.1
The register should detail the location and condition of the asbestos.
