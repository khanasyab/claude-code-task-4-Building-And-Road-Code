1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the design of the strengthening of concrete and steel highway
structures using fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs), including:
1)
flexural and shear strengthening of concrete bridge decks;
2)
flexural, shear and axial strengthening of concrete bridge supports; and
3)
flexural strengthening of steel bridges.
NOTE 1
The viability of FRP strengthening of reinforced concrete structures has been demonstrated through
experimental studies and numerous practical applications in the UK and elsewhere. Experience of the
application of FRPs to steel structures is more limited in highway structures and less experimental
verification exists.
NOTE 2
This document does not provide specific requirements for the strengthening of cast iron and wrought
iron structures. Relevant guidance is provided in CIRIA C595 [Ref 9.I]. The assessment of cast iron
and wrought iron structures is covered by CS 454 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 3
This document does not provide specific requirements for the strengthening of structures for fatigue.
1.2
This document shall be used for the design of the strengthening of concrete structures with externally
bonded steel plates.
Implementation
1.3
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving strengthening on the
Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 6.N].
Use of GG 101
1.4
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Applicability
2.
Applicability
2.1
The suitability of the structure for strengthening using FRPs or externally bonded steel plates shall be
assessed, and a viable strengthening methodology developed.
2.2
The assessment of suitability shall include:
1)
whether the strengthened structure would be robust in an accidental damage scenario;
2)
whether it is possible to achieve sufficient integrity of the interface between the strengthening
materials and the structure;
3)
whether the structure is over-reinforced;
4)
whether the strengthening would be effective and durable;
5)
the feasibility of sustained loading or prestress in FRP strengthening; and,
6)
an options report and economic evaluation including alternative methods of strengthening.
NOTE
The requirements for each item listed can be found in the relevant sub-section.
Robustness against accidental damage
2.3
Structures that are to be strengthened shall be sufficiently robust that the accidental damage or
removal of strengthening materials not protected from accidental damage or removal does not cause
collapse of the structure.
2.3.1
A structure may be strengthened using externally bonded FRPs or steel plates if it has sufficient
robustness that its ultimate limit state resistance after removal of the strengthening can be shown to be
at least sufficient to resist the effects of the frequent combination of actions without any partial factors
applied.
NOTE 1
The frequent combination of actions is defined in BS EN 1990 [Ref 3.N].
NOTE 2
Verification of the unstrengthened structure using the frequent combination of actions is equivalent to
the verification of the structure following removal of the strengthening in the accidental design situation.
2.3.2
Strengthening techniques where FRPs are embedded in a concrete structure, including the use of
near-surface-mounted (NSM) bars or deep embedment bars, may be considered to be protected from
accidental damage or removal, unless a specific risk of damage has been identified.
2.3.3
Where a specific risk has been identified relating to the possible damage of embedded FRP, the
approach to verifying robustness may be the same as for externally bonded strengthening.
2.4
Where FRPs are applied to the top surface of slabs or beams and buried by the road surfacing, the
FRP shall be protected from being damaged during installation and removal of surfacing.
NOTE
NSM FRP bars are embedded in concrete, which can provide protection to the FRP from the risk of
damage.
2.4.1
Where externally-bonded FRP laminates are used, protection from damage by hot surfacing during
installation may be provided by specifying FRP and adhesive materials which can tolerate high
temperatures or by providing a protective layer of mortar on top of the laminates.
2.4.2
Where externally-bonded FRP laminates are used, protection from removal of surfacing may include
studs with a thickness greater than that of the FRP laminates, bolted to the structure adjacent to FRP
laminates.
2.4.3
Where NSM FRP bars are used, protection from damage by hot surfacing during installation may be
provided by specifying an adhesive which can tolerate high temperatures.
Integrity of the interface with the structure
2.5
The interface between the structure and externally bonded FRPs or steel plates shall be capable of
sustaining the stresses necessary for tension to be developed in the FRP or steel plates.

======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 32
======================================================================
CD 371 Version 0.0.1
2. Applicability
NOTE
The effectiveness of externally bonded strengthening is highly dependent on the integrity of the bond
with the surface of the structure and also on the integrity of the surface material itself.
2.6
FRPs or steel plates shall not be bonded to a surface with a concave profile, unless justified through a
rigorous analysis or experimental results.
NOTE
If strengthening materials carrying tension are bonded to a concrete surface with a concave profile, the
likelihood of separation failure increases.
2.7
Externally bonded FRPs or steel plates shall not be bonded to uneven surfaces where the gap under a
1 m long straight edge exceeds 5 mm.
2.7.1
Externally bonded FRPs or steel plates may be used where the gap under a 1 m straight edge is up to
5 mm provided the depth of adhesive is varied to achieve the required straightness after installation.
2.8
The acceptable gap under a 1 m long straight edge held to the surface of FRPs or steel plates following
installation shall be no greater than 3 mm.
2.9
NSM FRP bars and deep embedment FRP bars shall be installed straight, without being bent.
2.10
When considering the suitability of a structure for strengthening with FRPs or steel plates,
investigations shall be carried out to ensure that the risk of corrosion in the existing member is low and
to determine the soundness of the structure, including any repaired areas.
NOTE
For concrete structures, CS 462 [Ref 7.I] gives advice on special inspections and guidance on suitable
tests.
2.11
The surface to be strengthened shall be dry, sound and undamaged prior to installation.
2.11.1
Where needed, remedial measures to achieve a dry, sound and undamaged surface should include:
1)
the stoppage of leaks and drying out of the whole depth of the member to be strengthened;
2)
removal of damaged material on the surface to be strengthened down to a sound base.
2.12
For concrete structures, the integrity of the surface concrete and its method of preparation shall be
demonstrated by a series of pull-off tests.
2.13
The requirements for the pull-off testing shall be set out in the specification.
2.14
Externally bonded FRPs or steel plates shall not be used for strengthening concrete structures when
the characteristic concrete tensile strength of the surface to be strengthened is less than 1.5 MPa.
2.14.1
The characteristic value of the concrete tensile strength may be taken as 70% of the mean of the test
results but not greater than the minimum test result.
Over-reinforced sections
2.15
When strengthening concrete structures, the sections to be strengthened shall not be over-reinforced,
either before or after strengthening.
NOTE
Over-reinforced sections are those where the ultimate limit state resistance is reached without yielding
of the steel reinforcement, for example a beam that has so much flexural reinforcement that flexural
failure could occur in a brittle mode without yielding of the steel.
Effectiveness and durability of the strengthening
2.16
Before undertaking a design, where uncertainties exist concerning the effectiveness of an FRP system
or steel plate bonding for a particular application, experimental testing on representative specimens
shall be undertaken to prove the technique is effective.
NOTE
Examples where testing might be required include the use of a material with significantly different
properties to those used in previous studies or applications, the use of a new approach or system, or
bonding onto an irregular, curved or deteriorated surface.

2. Applicability
2.17
Where testing is proposed to prove a strengthening technique, the requirements for, and the extent of,
the testing shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
2.18
Information and test results to demonstrate the long-term performance and durability of all components
of the strengthening system shall be sought from manufacturers and suppliers.
2.19
Steel plates shall be protected from corrosion.
NOTE
Requirements for the protection of steelwork against corrosion are given in CC 486 [Ref 7.N] with
scheme specific requirements provided in accordance with CD 350 [Ref 8.N].
2.20
Protective coatings and seals shall be specified in accordance with the recommendations from
manufacturers and suppliers to ensure the strengthening system is durable.
2.20.1
Protective coatings and seals may be required:
1)
to protect adhesives from water ingress and moisture;
2)
to protect FRP components from ultraviolet radiation;
3)
to reduce solar gain and consequence temperature rise of the FRP components;
4)
for protection against vandalism or accidental removal of the strengthening system; and
5)
for fire protection of the strengthening systems in situations where fire resistance is required.
FRP with sustained loading effects
2.21
Guidance shall be sought from specialist designers and materials suppliers when a strengthening
scheme includes the use of FRP subjected to significant, sustained loading effects.
NOTE 1
The efficiency of FRP strengthening can be increased by prestressing the FRP, or alternatively by
jacking up a structure during the installation of the FRP. These approaches provide strengthening for
permanent loads as well as variable loads, and enable a greater proportion of the FRP strength to be
used.
NOTE 2
Excessive sustained stress in FRP can result in creep rupture. Requirements for the avoidance of
creep rupture are provided in Section 3.
NOTE 3
For further guidance, see CS TR55 [Ref 3.I].
Options report and economic evaluation
2.22
An options report and economic evaluation shall be carried out to compare the proposed strengthening
technique with other methods for strengthening the structure in object.
2.23
Factors at options report stage shall include safety, cost, risks, performance history of the proposed
techniques, construction methods, environmental factors, remaining life, inspection and maintenance.

The strengthening system shall have sufficient fatigue resistance to achieve the design life.
3.3.1
The fatigue resistance of FRP strengthening components may be deemed to be satisfied.
3.3.2
The fatigue resistance of adhesives may be deemed to be satisfied where:
1)
the structure being strengthened is concrete; or
2)
the design stresses in the adhesive at the FRP ends due to traffic loading are less than 20% of
the design adhesive strength.
NOTE
The stresses at the ends of FRP bonded to steel structures are often dominated by thermal effects,
which occur at a relatively low frequency and are unlikely to cause fatigue problems.
3.3.3
The fatigue resistance of strengthening steel plates may be verified using the relevant parts of BS EN
1993 [Ref 6.I].
3.3.4
The fatigue resistance of the existing structure to be strengthened may be deemed to be satisfied
where:
1)
the structure has previously been assessed and there are no concerns relating to fatigue;
2)
the stress range in the fatigue-sensitive components of the existing structure is not expected to
increase in the strengthened configuration with the new loading regime.
NOTE
Requirements and advice regarding the need for fatigue assessment calculations are provided in CS
454 [Ref 2.I] and the associated assessment documents.
3.4
Where the fatigue resistance has not been deemed to be satisfied, the need and methodology for
fatigue verifications shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
Serviceability limit states
3.5
The strengthened structure shall satisfy the relevant design serviceability criteria for new structures,
unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
3.5.1
Serviceability verifications of the existing structural components may be deemed to be satisfied where:
1)
the structure has been performing satisfactorily in service without exceeding the relevant
serviceability criteria;
2)
the future loading carried by the structure is not expected to increase; and
3)
the addition of the strengthening will not increase the stress in the existing structural components.
3.6
The sustained stress in the FRP shall be limited at the serviceability limit state to avoid creep rupture.
3.6.1
The creep rupture criteria in CS TR55 [Ref 3.I] should be applied.

3. Basis of design
Design actions
3.7
The actions and partial factors shall be taken from the relevant parts of BS EN 1991 [Ref 4.N] and BS
EN 1990 [Ref 3.N] respectively.
NOTE
The actions for strengthening bridge supports for impact are contained in BS EN 1991-1-7 [Ref 1.N].
Structural analysis
3.8
The structural analysis methodology shall be selected considering the possibility of low ductility of
strengthened elements.
NOTE 1
Strengthened elements that have resistance governed by criteria relating to FRP fracture or separation
of the strengthening materials can exhibit failure modes that are brittle.
NOTE 2
Strengthening concrete bridge supports with FRPs can increase ductility through the provision of
confinement.
3.9
Structural analysis methods that rely on redistribution of load effects shall not be used unless it can be
robustly demonstrated that such redistribution would occur prior to failure.
3.9.1
Moments may be redistributed from an unstrengthened region into a strengthened region, where it can
be demonstrated that there is sufficient rotation capacity in the unstrengthened region.
3.10
The existing stresses in the structure at the time of strengthening shall be taken into account in the
design.
3.10.1
When there is uncertainty in the magnitude of the existing stresses, and when the design is sensitive to
the magnitude of the existing stresses, tests should be undertaken to quantify the existing stresses in
the structure.
NOTE 1
Stresses in the structure can arise from permanent actions (including support settlement) and variable
actions (including traffic and thermal actions).
NOTE 2
The strengthening design of statically indeterminate structures can be sensitive to the stress in the
structure at installation.
3.11
The redistribution of stresses due to creep in concrete following installation shall be considered where
the design is sensitive to such effects and where further creep is expected.
NOTE
Creep in prestressed concrete structures can cause compression to be developed in the strengthening
materials.
Partial factors for material properties
3.12
Design values of material properties shall be determined using representative values of material
properties and partial factors that are consistent with the target reliability for the strengthened structure.
3.12.1
Characteristic values or worst credible values of material properties should be used.
NOTE
A characteristic value is defined as the value below which not more than 5% of all possible test results
can be expected to fall.
3.12.2
Worst credible values should be derived for concrete structures in accordance with CS 455 [Ref 10.I].
3.12.3
The partial factors for concrete, reinforcement and prestressing steel at the ultimate limit state should
be taken from Table 3.12.3.

Strengthening concrete bridge supports with FRPs
General
6.1
When strengthening concrete bridge supports is required, an effective form of strengthening shall be
selected that complies with the requirements of this document.
6.1.1
Strengthening methodologies for concrete bridge supports using FRPs should be based on wrapping
the support in FRP fabric with fibres that are oriented in the hoop (horizontal) direction, and, if required,
in the axial (vertical) direction, bonded to the surface of the bridge support.
6.1.2
The outer layers of fibres should run in the hoop direction, to provide:
1)
shear reinforcement; and
2)
confinement effects.
NOTE 1
Enhancement of the concrete strength and ductility by confinement using FRPs is particularly effective
for strengthening circular bridge supports.
NOTE 2
The effectiveness of the FRP confinement for non-circular sections depends on the geometry of the
section and can be zero for rectangular sections. CS TR55 [Ref 3.I] provides guidance.
NOTE 3
For all sections, the stress that can be developed in the hoop FRP at failure is considerably lower than
the tensile strength of the FRP. CS TR55 [Ref 3.I] provides guidance.
6.2
A minimum of two layers of FRP hoop fibres shall be provided.
6.3
FRPs in the hoop direction shall be installed with an effective overlap so that the FRPs act as a
continuous hoop.
6.3.1
The length of the overlap should be determined in order to provide a full-strength anchorage and shall
be no less than 200 mm.
6.4
Where axial and hoop FRP are applied to a column, hoop FRP shall be placed over axial FRP.
6.5
FRPs in the axial direction shall be anchored effectively.
6.5.1
Anchorage lengths should be determined in accordance with CS TR55 [Ref 3.I].
6.6
Where strengthening is required to a bridge support below ground level or at the connection to the
base, a concrete collar shall be provided.
6.6.1
Concrete collars should extend from the base to ground level or above.
6.7
Where flexural strengthening is required at the top connection to the crosshead or deck, a concrete or
steel collar shall be provided.
6.8
The axial FRP shall be anchored effectively into the collar.
6.9
Collars and their connections into the structure or base shall be designed to resist the effects of the
actions.
6.10
The design shall be carried out to avoid stress concentrations on fibres where they emerge from collars.
6.11
Appropriate details, including the provision of drips and sealants, shall be provided to prevent the
ingress of water into the interface between the FRP and the concrete.
Strengthening for flexure and axial effects at the ultimate limit state
6.12
The flexural and axial resistance of bridge supports strengthened with FRPs shall be based on the
following assumptions:
1)
plane sections remain plane;
2)
there is perfect bond;
3)
the strains in the section at the time of strengthening are taken into account;

NOTE 1
Guidance on the flexural and axial resistance of circular and non-circular bridge supports strengthened
with FRP is provided in CS TR55 [Ref 3.I].
NOTE 2
CS TR55 [Ref 3.I] provides models for determining the degree of confinement that is possible in circular
and non-circular sections.
6.13
No enhancement of concrete properties due to confinement from the hoop FRP shall be included when
the aspect ratio of the cross section of the bridge support is greater than 3:2, or when the combination
of axial force and bending is such that the existing axial steel reinforcement yields in tension at ULS.
Strengthening for shear at the ultimate limit state
6.14
All failure modes that could govern the shear resistance shall be considered, including failure modes
limited by FRP rupture, concrete crushing and separation of FRP from the concrete.
NOTE
FRP separation failures are less significant for circular sections than for non-circular sections, due to
the confining effect on the bond.
6.14.1
For circular sections, separation of the FRP may be deemed to be prevented if the strain in the hoop
FRP is limited to 0.004.
6.14.2
The shear resistance of FRP strengthened bridge supports should be determined in accordance with
CS TR55 [Ref 3.I].

7.8
The design of FRP-strengthened steel structures shall include a detailed analysis of the local stresses
in the adhesive layer, including shear and tensile (peeling) stresses and taking account of any lack of
straightness in the FRP and yielding of the substrate.
NOTE 1
The behaviour of FRP-strengthened steel structures differs markedly from FRP-strengthened concrete
structures. For example, for concrete structures the adhesive strength generally greatly exceeds the
strength of the surface concrete, so the design is typically governed by the behaviour of the surface
concrete. However, for steel structures the behaviour of the adhesive itself can govern the capacity of
the strengthened member, and requires detailed consideration in the design.
NOTE 2
Peak local stresses typically occur in the adhesive near the ends of the FRP and at discontinuities or
changes in thickness, due to variable actions including traffic loading and differential thermal expansion.
NOTE 3
The stresses in the adhesive cannot be analysed making the assumption that plane sections remain
plane.
7.8.1
The analysis of the adhesive layer should be carried out using the methods of CIRIA C595 [Ref 9.I].

7. Strengthening steel structures with FRPs
7.8.2
Stresses in the adhesive may be reduced by increasing the width of the FRPs and by tapering the
FRPs near the end of the strengthening.
NOTE
As the width of pre-manufactured FRP laminates is increased, the difficulty of expelling the air under
the laminate during installation also increases, particularly for laminates wider than 300 mm.
7.9
Thermal effects shall be included in the design, including differential thermal expansion between the
FRP and the steel.
NOTE
The coefficient of thermal expansion of FRP can differ significantly from that of steel elements. As a
result differential thermal expansion can lead to significant stress concentrations at the ends of
externally bonded FRP laminates and at any other geometric discontinuities.
7.10
The thermal effects shall be evaluated considering the timing of the operation and the range of effective
bridge temperatures likely to be encountered.
7.10.1
Thermal actions should be taken from BS EN 1991-1-5 [Ref 4.I].
7.11
When FRP strengthening is proposed to enhance the fatigue life, shear capacity, bearing capacity or
buckling resistance of metallic elements or to enhance the capacity of connections, the design approach
shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation based on specialist guidance and proved by testing.
7.12
Cracked steel structures shall not be strengthened using FRP.
7.13
When a carbon-fibre based system is used to strengthen a steel structure, an insulating layer shall be
used between the carbon fibre and steel substrate to electrically isolate the FRP and prevent galvanic
corrosion.
7.14
The effectiveness of the isolation system used between the carbon fibre and steel substrate to
electrically isolate the FRP and prevent galvanic corrosion shall be verified by testing.

Strengthening concrete structures with externally bonded steel
plates
General
8.1
When strengthening of concrete structures is required, an effective strengthening methodology shall be
selected that complies with the requirements of this document.
8.1.1
Flexural strengthening methodologies for concrete structures using steel plates should be based on the
application of steel plates bonded to the concrete surface to enhance the flexural resistance.
NOTE
This document does not cover the strengthening for shear using steel plates.
8.2
The resistance to all failure modes that could govern the flexural resistance shall be verified, including
failure modes where there is a loss of composite action between the steel plates and the concrete, and
failure modes where composite action is maintained.
Design for anchorage and separation
8.3
Sufficient anchorage shall be provided beyond the point at which the steel plates are required to be
effective.
8.3.1
The effective anchorage length should not be less than 1.2 times the plate width, plus 100 mm.
8.3.2
Where the width to thickness ratio of the plate is less than 60, the effective anchorage length should not
be less than 1.5 times the plate width, plus 100 mm.
8.3.3
Bolts should be provided within the anchorage length.
8.3.4
Bolts within the anchorage length should be designed to resist 3 times the ultimate limit state
longitudinal shear stress and be adequately anchored into the concrete substrate.
8.4
The longitudinal shear stress at the interface shall be limited to avoid failure of the concrete or the
adhesive, using the same methods as for FRP-strengthened concrete structures in Section 5.
8.5
Separation initiated by shear cracking shall be avoided using the same methods as for
FRP-strengthened concrete structures in Section 5.
8.6
Where it is necessary to extend the plates into an area in compression, the possibility of buckling and a
loss of composite action shall be included in the design.
8.6.1
Buckling restraint provided by the bonded interface should be ignored.
8.6.2
Bolts may be used to resist buckling.
8.6.3
The spacing of bolts to resist plate buckling should be determined by calculation, considering
imperfections and ignoring any restraint from adhesive.
8.6.4
The spacing of bolts to resist plate buckling should not exceed 300 mm.
Flexural resistance at the ultimate limit state
8.7
The strengthened section shall be designed to have sufficient flexural resistance based on composite
action being maintained.
8.8
The flexural resistance of the strengthened section shall be determined based on the following
principles and assumptions:
1)
plane sections remain plane;
2)
perfect bond is assumed;
3)
the strains in the section at the time of strengthening are taken into account;
4)
zero tension in the concrete at ULS;

the stress in the concrete compression zone is determined based on a constitutive model for
flexural design;
6)
the strain in the concrete in the compression zone is limited to avoid crushing failure;
7)
the stress in the reinforcement and prestressing is determined based on constitutive models for
design;
8)
the stress in the steel plate is limited to the design yield strength;
9)
the loss of section which may occur during grit blasting is taken into account in the design; and
10)
additional longitudinal tensile forces associated with shear effects are included in the design.
8.8.1
The design models for the concrete, reinforcement and prestressing should be taken from BS EN 1992
[Ref 5.I].
8.8.2
The steel plate should be designed in accordance with BS EN 1993 [Ref 6.I].
8.9
The strengthened section shall not be over-reinforced at the ultimate limit state.
NOTE
Over-reinforced sections are those where the ultimate limit resistance is reached without yielding of the
steel reinforcement.
Geometry of the plates
8.10
The width to thickness ratio of the plates shall not be less than 50.
8.11
The plate thickness shall not be less than 4 mm.
NOTE
The minimum plate thickness is required to avoid distortions during grit blasting and handling on site.

Installation, inspection and maintenance
Installation
9.1
The specification shall provide detailed requirements for the surface preparation of the structure, the
application of the adhesive or resin, and the installation of the strengthening materials.
NOTE 1
The effectiveness of FRP strengthening and steel plate bonding is highly dependent upon the quality of
installation.
NOTE 2
Further guidance is provided in CS TR55 [Ref 3.I] and CS TR57 [Ref 8.I] for concrete structures.
NOTE 3
The guidance in CS TR57 [Ref 8.I] refers to FRP strengthening but can also be relevant for steel plate
bonding.
Inspection and maintenance
9.2
A comprehensive manual of procedures for inspection and maintenance of the strengthened structure
shall be prepared including:
1)
procedures for long-term monitoring and testing;
2)
all relevant technical literature relating to the products used;
3)
installation records, drawings, test findings and photographs of critical details. procedures for
minor repairs;
4)
accurate drawings indicating the as-built location of all FRP components and steel plates,
including those buried by surfacing;
5)
inspection methods to enable the identification of areas of debonding of externally bonded FRP
laminates and steel plates; and
6)
requirements for the inspection of the strengthening system before and after the passage of a
significant abnormal load.
NOTE
Debonding of FRPs and steel plates buried by surfacing can be indicated by local break-up or reflective
cracking of the surface at the strengthening location.
