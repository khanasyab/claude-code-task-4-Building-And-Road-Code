3.
Pavement design of footway and cycle tracks
General requirements for subgrade for footways and cycle tracks
3.1
The design subgrade surface modulus for use in the pavement design shall be determined in
accordance with CD 225 [Ref 2.N].
3.2
Improvement of subgrade shall be designed where:
1)
surface modulus is lower than 30 MPa;
2)
the subgrade is frost susceptible within the mean annual frost index (MAFI) zone; or,
3)
the subgrade has potential for shrink / swell damage to the pavement.
3.3
Where the surface modulus is lower than 30 MPa, the subgrade improvement design shall include:
1)
replacement with a minimum of 150 mm unbound capping; or,
2)
soil stabilisation.
3.3.1
Mechanical stabilisation (geogrids and/or geotextiles) may be used to improve the performance of the
unbound capping.
NOTE
Subgrades with a design subgrade surface modulus value lower than 30 MPa are unsuitable to support
the construction of a pavement foundation.
3.4
The upper limit on design surface modulus for areas of improvement of the subgrade shall be 50 MPa.
3.5
Materials shall be non-frost susceptible within the zone of influence of the pavement, which is:
1)
450 mm of the surface, where the MAFI is 50 or greater; or,
2)
350 mm of the surface, where the MAFI is less than 50.
NOTE 1
Frost susceptible soils possess moderate permeability and a fairly high capillarity to enable water to be
drawn up to the ice front. Capillary activity and permeability that permits water migration to be frost
susceptible are associated with silts, silty fine sands and composite soils.
NOTE 2
Information to support determination of the MAFI is available from the Met Office.
NOTE 3
Further information on the development and calculation of the MAFI is available in TRL RR 45 [Ref 5.I].
3.6
Where frost susceptible or shrink swell materials are encountered within the zone of influence of the
pavement the design shall include:
1)
replacement with non-frost susceptible material; or,
2)
stabilisation to form a non-frost susceptible material.
NOTE 1
Shrink swell is the volume change that occurs as a result of changes in the water content of clay rich
soils. Swelling pressures can cause heave, or lifting of the pavement structure, whilst shrinkage can
cause differential settlement and cracking.
NOTE 2
Clay rich soil properties that are consistent with the potential for swelling include a plasticity index (PI)
of 15 or greater; and more than 10 percent of the soil particles are less than 5 micrometers in size.
NOTE 3
Further information for assessing and reporting the effects of climate change on the asset is available
in LA 114 [Ref 1.N].
Pavement loading of footways and cycle tracks
3.7
The structural design life for a new footway or cycle track pavement shall be not less than 40 years.
3.8
Footway and cycle tracks shall be divided into sections to represent the anticipated loading category.
NOTE
Sections are used to identify where different traffic loadings are anticipated, such as vehicular
crossings to domestic properties or for heavy goods vehicle access.

3. Pavement design of footway and cycle tracks
3.9
The loading for the footway or cycle track section shall be categorised as follows:
1)
Foot and cycle traffic only;
2)
Foot, cycle and light vehicle traffic only; or
3)
Foot, cycle and heavy vehicle traffic.
Loading category 1: Foot and cycle traffic only
3.10
The foot and cycle traffic only category shall be used where the footway or cycle track is physically
separated from the carriageway with no vehicular traffic.
3.10.1
Physical separation from the carriageway should include a:
1)
barrier or other permanent obstruction such that vehicular traffic cannot mount the footway/cycle
track; or
2)
a verge of width 3 m or greater.
NOTE
The foot and cycle traffic only category can be used where the footway or cycle track is not physically
separated from the carriageway but where there can be no use or overrun by vehicles, including
cleaning or maintenance vehicles.
Loading category 2: Foot, cycle and light vehicle traffic only
3.11
The foot, cycle and light vehicle traffic only category shall be used where:
1)
there is a domestic crossing, that is access to a private driveway;
2)
occasional overrun by HGVs is likely (i.e. two or three times in a year by delivery vehicles);
3)
there is no physical separation from the carriageway through residential areas; or,
4)
cumulative vehicular traffic loading over the design life is less than 0.05 msa.
Loading category 3: Foot, cycle and heavy vehicle traffic
3.12
The foot, cycle and heavy vehicle traffic category shall be used where there is:
1)
a crossing, and overrun by HGV is likely (i.e. allowing for one vehicle per day over the design life
time);
2)
no physical separation from the carriageway in areas where deliveries take place;
3)
uncertainty about the frequency of HGV overrun; or,
4)
cumulative vehicular traffic loading over the design life is less than 0.5 msa.
Footway and cycle track surface course selection
3.13
Bituminous surfacing shall be used for cycle tracks.
3.14
Tactile paving shall be selected for areas identified in accordance with CD 143 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
Further information on tactile surfaces is available in 'Guidance on the use of Tactile Paving Surfaces'
GUTPS [Ref 8.N].
Footway and cycle track pavement construction options and thickness design
Footway and cycle track pavement subbase
3.15
The pavement subbase design thicknesses corresponding to each pavement loading category shall be
selected from table 3.15.

NOTE
Material types for all layers are further defined in CC 207 [Ref 3.I].
4.2.1
Natural stone slabs or setts may be used for footways for aesthetic reasons when indicated by
environmental design considerations.
NOTE 1
Natural stone slabs or setts are not recommended for new footways, primarily for reasons of high
maintenance requirements.
NOTE 2
Larger flag/slab sizes are restricted because they can be difficult to lay, requiring mechanical handling,
and can be damaged by vehicle overrun.
4.3
The category for percentage of crushed or broken particles in coarse aggregate for unbound subbase
and HBGM shall be detailed.
4.4
The resistance to fragmentation of coarse aggregate for HBGM shall be detailed.
4.5
Where induced cracking is required in the design, the crack spacing for HBGM shall be detailed.
4.6
The footway laying pattern design for paving units shall be selected from:
1)
stack bond;
2)
stretcher bond;
3)
45 degree herringbone;
4)
90 degree herringbone;
5)
45 degree stretcher bond;
6)
90 degree stretcher bond;
7)
basket weave; or,
8)
two size herringbone.
4.7
The footway edge detail design for paving units shall be selected from:

5. Access steps design
5.
Access steps design
5.1
Access steps shall have a rise and going that achieves the safety requirements formulae of BS EN ISO
14122-3 [Ref 10.N].
5.2
The maximum pitch of the access steps shall be 45°.
5.3
Access steps shall have a minimum clear width of 800 mm.
5.4
Access steps shall have a change in horizontal direction of not less than 30°, by means of a landing,
after a maximum of 16 steps.
5.5
Where a landing changes the horizontal direction by 90°, the width of the landing shall be a minimum of
two times the width of the access steps.
5.6
The minimum length of a landing shall be the width of the access steps.
5.7
All goings and landings shall have a nonslip surface.
5.8
At least one guardrail shall be provided on all landings and access steps.
5.9
The guardrail shall comprise both knee and handrail.
5.10
The centre of the guardrail shall be offset 150 mm in from the edge.
5.11
Where the access steps width is equal to or greater than 1.2 m a second guardrail shall be provided on
the opposite edge.
