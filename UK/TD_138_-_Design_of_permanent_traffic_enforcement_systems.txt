2. General requirements for permanent traffic en...
2.
General requirements for permanent traffic enforcement systems
Principles to be applied to the design of permanent traffic enforcement systems
2.1
Permanent traffic enforcement systems shall be designed:
1)
for operation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week;
2)
so that the enforcement authority (EA), for which the permanent traffic enforcement system is
being provided, can access and process the data and information outputs from the system from
its premises;
3)
so that all equipment and infrastructure that forms part of a permanent traffic enforcement system
is secured to prevent unauthorised access and tampering.
2.2
Where a permanent traffic enforcement system is to be installed for the purposes of providing evidence
for the prosecution of road traffic offences, the permanent traffic enforcement system shall have Home
Office Type Approval (HOTA).
2.3
All permanent traffic enforcement system installation locations shall be agreed with the EA for which
the permanent traffic enforcement system is being provided.
2.4
Agreements reached with the EA for which the permanent traffic enforcement system is being provided
shall be recorded and copies of the records supplied to the Overseeing Organisation.
Design of supports and foundations for permanent traffic enforcement systems
2.5
Where a permanent traffic enforcement system is to be mounted on a structure other than a gantry, the
design of the supports, foundations and mounting arrangements shall be carried out using CD 354 [Ref
1.N].
Design of gantries for permanent traffic enforcement systems
2.6
Where a permanent traffic enforcement system is to be mounted on a gantry, the design of the gantry,
foundations and mounting arrangements shall be carried out using CD 365 [Ref 5.N].
Design of road restraint systems for permanent traffic enforcement systems
2.7
The design of road restraint systems for permanent traffic enforcement systems shall be carried out
using CD 377 [Ref 8.N].
Outputs from the design of permanent traffic enforcement systems
2.8
The outputs from the design of each permanent traffic enforcement system shall include all details for
the construction of the supporting infrastructure and the installation of the permanent traffic
enforcement system.
2.8.1
For each permanent traffic enforcement system, the design outputs should include details of:
1)
type and variant of the system to be installed;
2)
the installation location(s), using a formal location referencing system, including:
a)
on the road; and
b)
in the premises of the EA(s);
3)
the position and orientation of all components of the proposed installation relative to other items
of existing and proposed road infrastructure, including the edge of the carriageway, so that the
following can be identified:
a)
the environment in which the installation is to take place;
b)
the factors that can influence the construction methodology and scheduling of the proposed
installation;

3.
Design requirements for permanent traffic enforcement systems
Design of permanent traffic enforcement systems
3.1
Where an operational need has been established, a permanent traffic enforcement system shall be
used.
NOTE 1
HADECS permanent traffic enforcement systems can be used for the enforcement of:
1)
variable mandatory speed limits; and
2)
lane closures which are depicted by red 'X' traffic signs.
NOTE 2
The use of HADECS permanent traffic enforcement systems relies on the provision of variable
message signs and signals that can display variable mandatory speed limits and red 'X' traffic signs,
and that are listed on the HOTA schedule for the selected HADECS product.
NOTE 3
TRH 2487 [Ref 3.N]provides guidance on the design of the infrastructure for HADECS permanent traffic
enforcement systems.
NOTE 4
Non-HADECS permanent traffic enforcement systems can include:
1)
HOTA systems which are intended to provide evidence for the prosecution of road traffic offences
- e.g. an average speed camera system for the enforcement of fixed speed limits; and
2)
systems which are not intended to provide evidence for the prosecution of road traffic offences
- e.g. a non-HOTA automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system that provides data and
information to support the prevention and detection of crime.
NOTE 5
An EA can request the installation of a non-HADECS permanent traffic enforcement system to help it
meet its operational needs.
3.2
Where a permanent traffic enforcement system is to be installed for the purposes of providing evidence
for the prosecution of road traffic offences, the installation shall be designed:
1)
so that the system satisfies the requirements of its HOTA; and
2)
in accordance with any constraints in the legislation that defines the road traffic regulation(s)
being enforced.
NOTE
Constraints in the legislation that defines the road traffic regulation(s) being enforced can include, for
example:
1)
defined locations for the start and end of a particular speed limit; and
2)
display of regulations or prohibitions using traffic signs that are of the size, colour and type
prescribed in traffic signs legislation.
3.3
The design details for each permanent traffic enforcement system to be installed shall be agreed with
the Overseeing Organisation.

4. Commissioning, calibration and verification r...
4.4.1
Drive-through tests with a reference vehicle, which is equipped with a calibrated speed measurement
and location tracking device, should be used for the inspection, measurement and testing of:
1)
the accuracy and reliability of vehicle speed measurements;
2)
the accuracy and reliability of baseline link length measurements;
3)
the accuracy and reliability of traffic light and prohibited lane violation records; and
4)
the quality of images produced by the system.
4.4.2
For the purposes of carrying out measurements and tests of the accuracy and reliability of an
installation's speed measurements using a reference vehicle, the speed threshold used by the system
to establish when an offence has occurred may be temporarily lowered so that the reference vehicle
does not have to exceed the speed limit that applies to the road and can travel at the prevailing traffic
speed.
4.5
The inspection, measurement and testing plan for each non-HADECS permanent traffic enforcement
system shall include the methodology to be used for:
1)
keeping each EA informed throughout the implementation of the inspection, measurement and
testing plan;
2)
calibrating the inspection, measurement and testing devices used in the inspection,
measurement and testing of each system;
3)
producing calibration certificates for the inspection, measurement and testing devices used in the
inspection, measurement and testing of each system which are signed and dated by the
person(s) responsible for their preparation;
4)
producing records of all inspections, measurements and tests which are signed and dated by the
person(s) responsible for their preparation; and
5)
producing a certificate which confirms compliance of the each installed system with its HOTA
(where applicable); the applicable inspection, measurement and testing acceptance criteria; and
the accuracy of the inspection, measurement and testing documentation, and is signed and dated
by the person responsible for its preparation.
