Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document examines the key parameters used in the hydraulic design of pipelines and provides
further guidance in determining optimum design, based on sediment transport, in terms of roughness
coefficient and velocity.
The structural design of pipes for road drainage is described in CD 533: Determination of pipe and
bedding combinations for highway drainage CD 533 [Ref 2.I].
The introduction of sumpless gullies, see CD 527 [Ref 4.I], led to a change of drainage philosophy to
reduce maintenance where practical and improve the quality of surface water run off from the
carriageway. The elimination of the gully sump can lead to an improvement in water quality but can
potentially increase the amount of sediment entering the drainage system. By improving the ability of
the pipeline to transport sediment, there is scope to reduce the number or frequency of catchpits and to
trap sediment at more centralised locations where it can be removed without recourse to the major
traffic management associated with lane closures.
In pipes with no sediment deposits, the pipe discharge capacity may be reduced by up to 4% due to
increased energy losses caused by the movement of sediment along the pipe invert (see Construction
Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) Report CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I]).
Sediment deposition in the pipe has a more pronounced impact resulting from the combination of
reduced cross-sectional area and an increase in bed roughness. Where the depth of deposition
represents a small proportion of the pipe diameter, then the in loss of discharge capacity is primarily
due to the increased bed roughness.
The sediment loads monitoring study Sediment Loads [Ref 3.I] confirmed that land use has a significant
effect on the volume of sediment entering the drainage system, and that there is a marked difference in
volume between rural and urban locations. However existing land use is a changeable factor, both in
terms of time and distance along a road. During the life of a road, adjacent rural areas may easily
change from being grazing grounds (grassland) to forested areas, for example. It is unwise to base the
design of the drainage system on factors that cannot be controlled.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard", or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause GG 101 [Ref 1.N].

Sediment transport
Design
Sediment load
2.1
Pipelines shall be designed to transport sediment.
NOTE
Urban roads, which have been found to create more sediment than rural roads, generate maximum
values in the order of 200 g/m2 per annum, about 90 g/m2 per annum of which is retained in gully pots.
See Sediment Loads [Ref 3.I].
Sediment concentration
2.2
A value of sediment concentration shall be inserted into the assessment calculation based on evidence
or the default value of 50 mg/l, referring to the note below.
NOTE
The value of sediment concentration obtained for rural roads corresponds approximately to the 'medium
concentration' recommended in CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] for sewer design, that is 50 mg/l, whereas for
urban roads it is approximately 115 mg/l, a value that is still well below the 'high concentration' value
given in CIRIA R141 (200 mg/l). This indicates that sediment concentration levels in UK road drainage
are comparable with the average values associated with other surface water sewers.
Methodology to assess sediment load
2.3
The methodology adopted to assess sediment load shall use sediment sizes as surrogate parameters
for the type of location factor, i.e. urban versus rural.
NOTE
Measurements of sediment loads at these two types of location showed that sediment from urban
roads has an average sizes of 0.5 mm whereas sediment coming from rural surrounds tends to be
larger, with an average size of 0.9 mm.
2.4
Sediment sizes of 0.5 mm for urban locations and 0.9 mm for rural locations shall be used in the
calculation the sediment volumes.
2.5
Carrier pipes shall be designed to achieve 'self-cleansing' conditions that either prevent sediment from
depositing or allow a certain amount of deposition, that is not detrimental, and produce a balance
between the processes of deposition and erosion during a specified period.
2.5.1
A simplified approach given in CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] may be used which assumes a bed deposit equal
to 2% of pipe diameter.
Sediment transport
2.6
Highway drainage pipelines shall be designed to transport sediment.
NOTE
A thorough evaluation of the various sediment transport equations has been carried out and presented
in CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] . This shows that the equation 2.6N, developed from data collected in pipes
with diameters in the range 150 to 450 mm, gave prediction values that were closer to the six sets of
laboratory data than most of the other equations and produced smaller standard deviations.
Calculations using this equation involve two stages:
1) the roughness of the sediment bed is first determined and then used to calculate the hydraulic
resistance of the pipe;
2) the sediment concentration is calculated from the known flow conditions. The resistance of the bed
(which is composed of grain resistance and of form resistance caused by the development of dunes)
was found to be dependent on the grain mobility factor and on the Froude number of the flow.

NOTE
This equation has been adopted in the simplified guidance given in Part B of CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] . In

which are only practical to carry out by means of a computer program. For details of the full equation
and its associated parameters see CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I]

3. Pipe roughness coefficients
3.
Pipe roughness coefficients
General
3.1
The hydraulic design of pipelines shall allow for a depth of deposited sediment equivalent to 2% of the
pipe diameter.
3.1.1
The effect of the bed roughness should be accounted for in the design of pipelines to include the overall
roughness of the pipe, or its composite roughness kc .
NOTE
The presence of sediment increases the roughness coefficient to a value above the one associated
with the pipe material only, k0 .
3.1.2
The roughness coefficient of the sediment bed, kb, may be estimated using an equation (Equation
3.1.2) developed from laboratory tests on pipe full flows:
Equation 3.1.2 Roughness coefficient of the sediment bed
kb = 5.62R0.61d0.39
50
NOTE
Of the various methods used for calculating the composite roughness, the method deemed most
reliable at the current time is that which uses the perimeter weighting of the Darcy-Weisbach friction
factors for the bed and pipe walls. This takes into account the proportional weights of the two types of
roughness and their hydraulic contribution to friction losses and is given as Equation 3.1.2N:
Equation 3.1.2N Composite friction factor
λc = λ0P0 + λbWb
P0 + Wb
3.1.3
Where the composite friction factor λc is known, the composite roughness kc may be calculated from
the simplified formula (Equation 3.1.3):
Equation 3.1.3 Composite roughness
kc = 3.7D
[
10−( 1
4 λc)0.5]
NOTE 1
As an example, the values of composite roughness coefficient obtained for two different assumptions of
pipe wall roughness can be found in Tables 3.1.3N2a and 3.1.3N2b.
NOTE 2
The two different assumptions of pipe wall roughness:
1) the design condition k0 = 0.006 mm
2) deteriorated condition due to pipe ageing and misalignment k0 = 2.1 mm.

Head loss in hydraulic design
4.1
The design of pipelines for highway drainage shall allow for the head losses in the pipeline.
4.1.1
The velocities required to maintain sediment transport and minimise deposition are a function of pipe
gradient and should be expressed as either a minimum velocity or a minimum gradient.
NOTE 1
Minimum velocities have been determined on the assumption of continuous straight pipelines.
However, as part of the design, changes in direction of the pipe are necessary and these result in a
reduction in flow velocity or head loss.
NOTE 2
Loss of energy or head loss occurs wherever there is an impact on the flow within the pipe or channel.
Local losses that occur in highway drainage systems can typically be associated with the presence of
bends and junctions in pipes, entry to and exit from manholes/chambers/gully pots and exit at outfalls.
NOTE 3
Local losses are approximately proportional to the square of the flow velocity, V, and it is common
practice to assign to them a non-dimensional loss coefficient K, which results from the division of the
head loss by the velocity parameter V2/2g (kinematic head).

NOTE 5
Data collected during the Sediment Loads Monitoring Study Sediment Loads [Ref 3.I] revealed that,
within the various rural locations, there was a wide range of average sediment sizes depending on the
land use of the surrounding areas. The maximum average sediment size measured corresponded to
adjacent grassland and had d50 = 2.15 mm. Additional computer simulations were carried out to assess
the effect of the larger sediment size on minimum velocities and pipe gradients and these are
summarised in Table 4.1.1N5.

When compared with similar conditions, but having smaller sediment size (see Table 4.1.1N4b), the
larger sediment particle size necessitates higher minimum flow velocities and steeper pipe gradients.

Appendix A. Procedure to develop tables for the design of pipes in
average and deteriorated condition
A1
Pipe roughness coefficient (k0):
Determination of a suitable baseline value for the pipe roughness coefficient, k0, to be used in the
design, and which is representative of any pipe material likely to be used in road drainage: Although a
wide range of materials is available, a value of k0 = 0.6 mm is commonly used to represent the pipe
roughness average conditions when new.
Determination of a suitable value for the pipe roughness coefficient, k0, which is representative of the
deteriorated pipe condition (ageing plus misalignment): The effect of ageing was taken into account by
increasing the roughness coefficient to 1.5 mm and an additional increase of 0.6 mm for misalignment.
This corresponds to a step of 14-18 mm at the pipe joint and raises the total value of the coefficient to
2.1 mm.
A2
Composite pipe roughness kc:
Sediment load and type of location (rural versus urban) was represented by using a sediment size of
0.5 mm for urban roads and 0.9 mm for rural roads: The corresponding values of composite pipe
roughness, kc, due to the presence of the sediment, were calculated for the range of pipe sizes typically
available for use in road drainage (150 mm to 900 mm).
A3
Temperature value T and specific gravity:
A suitable temperature value for the water needed to be stated as this affects the value of viscosity and
friction losses in the pipes. A value of T = 15oC was adopted. Also an appropriate value for the specific
gravity of the sediment needed to be determined. From the Sediment Loads Monitoring Report
Sediment Loads [Ref 3.I], the average particle density was determined as being 2,220 kg/m3 for both
rural and urban locations. A value of specific gravity of 2.22 was subsequently used in all simulations.
A4
Transport equation for deposited bed:
Refer to equation 1 in Chapter 3 of CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] to obtain minimum flow velocities V and
associated pipe gradients.

General
The parameters below have been derived from site trials in England. The derived geographical factors
are based on rainfall, soil type and general topography and hence only apply to England.
E/A1.1
Sediment deposition in pipes
The volume of sediment deposited in the pipeline, the primary bed load (Bp), is the volume of sediment
annually generated by an area of road and is taken to be 0.05 kg/m2 per annum according to the report
"Monitoring of sediment loads from high speed roads" Sediment Loads [Ref 1.I].
To determine the predicted sediment load for a section of road, the specific bed load (Bs), the primary
bed load is multiplied by the sum of four weighted factors.
These factors are:
1) Land use (Fl);
2) Geographical location (Fg);
3) Road size (Fr); and
4) Profile (Fp).
A coefficient, or weighting, is then applied in the formula to represent the influence these factors have
on sediment deposition.
The figures are then inserted into the following equation (in kg/m2):
Land uses and factors (Fl) are:
1) Rural general (adjacent land has a mixture of uses): 1.0
2) Rural grassland (adjacent land is predominantly covered with grassland): 0.9
3) Rural arable (adjacent land is used for arable farming): 0.1
4) Rural forested (adjacent land has a very high number of trees): 0.35
A weighting of 50% is applied to the land-use factors.
Geographical location and factors (Fg) are:
1) South West: 1.0
2) London, South and SE: 0.1
3) East Anglia: 17.0
4) Midlands: 4.2
5) NE and Yorkshire: 6.2
6) Lancs, Cumbria and NW: 1.5
A weighting of 35% is applied to the geographical location factors.
Road size and factors (Fr) are:
1) 2-lane carriageway: 0.4
2) 3-lane carriageway: 1.0
3) 4-lane carriageway: 12
A weighting of 10% is applied to the road size factors.
Profile and factors (Fp) are:
1) level: 56.0
2) cutting: 1.0
3) embankment: 1.2.
A weighting of 5% is applied to profile factors.

CD 523 Version 1.0.1
Appendix E/A. Assessment of sediment deposition in pipes
Equation E/A.1 Total site specific bed load
Bs = Bp(Fl + Fg + Fr + Fp)
To calculate the total site specific bed load, insert the weighted factors into the following equation (in
kg/m2):
Equation E/A.2 Weighted site specific bed load
Bs = Bp[(0.5Fl) + (0.35Fg) + (0.1Fr) + (0.05Fp)]
The proportion of the generated sediment that enters the gully (Bsg) has been measured as being 40%
of the total sediment load, hence (in kg/m2):
Equation E/A.3 Gully retained sediment proportion
Bsg = 0.4Bs
For sediment removal refer to MCHW Series 0500 [Ref 2.N] .
This procedure provides an indication of the volume of sediment that may enter a section of pipeline.
Refer to the sediment predictor spreadsheet and input the particular pipeline characteristics to
determine whether or not sediment deposition is likely to occur. The result provides the basis for
defining the appropriate cleaning frequency for the pipeline. Note this does not indicate that the
pipeline needs replacing.
E/A1.2
Sediment predictor spreadsheet
This spreadsheet contained in the drainage data management system (DDMS) offers a simple way to
determine the likelihood of sedimentation in a piped network. It is based on a simple shear stress
calculation, as bed shear stress has been found to be linked to the erosion and deposition of solids in
pipes, each of which are initiated at critical shear stresses, which depend on the characteristics of the
solids concerned.
Note that this method is only applicable to circular pipes. It does not predict sedimentation in gullies.
Bed shear stress is linked to velocity of flow. Erosion of existing sediment is initiated when the velocity
rises and the bed shear stress exceeds the critical stress for erosion, τerosion . Similarly, sediment is
deposited when the shear stress falls below the critical stress for deposition, τdeposition , at lower flows.
In between the two, sediment remains in suspension. The spreadsheet compares bed shear at various
depths of flow with the critical values to indicate susceptibility to erosion or deposition.
This view is simplified, largely because it ignores whether there is sediment available to be deposited or
eroded, and the capacity of the flow to transport solids. This, however, is the province of a detailed
time-stepping model and is beyond a simple spreadsheet solution.
The inputs needed are simple:
1) pipe reference (text),
2) pipe diameter (in mm),
3) pipe roughness (equivalent sand roughness ks in mm),
4) pipe gradient (decimal),
5) sediment particle size (d50 in mm),
6) sediment specific gravity (dimensionless).
These can be input manually or copied from another source such as the output of a design model.
Deposition and erosion factors are also needed. These factors are dimensionless. Default values are:
γdeposition = 0.08;

CD 523 Version 1.0.1
Appendix E/A. Assessment of sediment deposition in pipes
γerosion = 0.28
These factors are used to calculate the critical shear stresses, and can be varied to calibrate the
spreadsheet in particular cases where the critical values are known from laboratory tests or other
sources such as published literature for similar solids.
The results are presented in 'traffic light' form. Detailed instructions are included in the spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet should be used as part of a risk assessment. The first stage of this would be to
identify whether the catchment is at risk of causing significant wash off of solids. If so, the
representative particle size and specific gravity need to be determined, preferably using samples
collected on site. If site-specific data are not available, a range of values should be used.
The spreadsheet then identifies any pipe lengths that are susceptible to deposition. Where possible,
these should be redesigned to eliminate the risk, generally by steepening the gradient. If this is
impractical or excessively expensive, it may be worth commissioning a more detailed model to identify
the risk and any improvements needed in greater detail.
Should the potential for sediment deposition remain following redesign, then alternative methods of
preventing or reducing the volume of sediment entering the pipeline need to be investigated. It may be
that, in these circumstances, a pipeline is not the most appropriate drainage system.

Appendix E/B. Sediment prediction - worked examples
Appendix E/B. Sediment prediction - worked examples
Removal of sediment from the drainage system is a routine maintenance activity that needs to be
programmed. Being able to assess the volume of sediment that may enter the drain at certain locations
should assist in this programming. The volume of sediment entering the piped system can be
estimated from the formulae in Appendix E/A.
E/B1
Example 1 (an extreme case)
To estimate the volume for a 2.5 km section of 3-lane motorway constructed at grade through a rural
arable site in Essex.
The land use factor for rural arable is 0.1
The geographical location factor for East Anglia is 17.0, the road size factor for a 3-lane carriageway is
1.0 and the profile factor for a road at grade is 56.0.
The appropriate weightings are applied to the factors and inserted into the equation.
The total site specific bed load is calculated from:
Bs = Bp(Fl + Fg + Fr + Fp) kg/m2
Bs = 0.05 x([0.1x50%] + [17x35%] + [1x10%] + [56x5%]) kg/m2
Bs = 0.445 kg/m2 per annum
Paved area = 30.3m (29+paved c/r) x 2,500 m
Sediment load = 0.445 x 30.3 x 2,500 kg/m2
Sediment load = 33,931.25 kg
or
33.9 tonnes per annum
or
13.6 kg/m run or 13.6 tonne/km
The proportion entering the gullies is 40%
Bsg = 0.4 x Bs
Bsg = 0.4 x 33.9 Tonnes
Bsg = 13.56 Tonnes
E/B2
Example 2
To estimate the volume of sediment generated for a 1.8 km section of 2-lane motorway on embankment
through grassland in Shropshire.
The land use factor for rural grassland is 0.9
The geographical location factor for Shropshire is 4.2, the road size factor for a 2-lane motorway is 0.4
and the profile factor for a road on embankment is 1.2.
The appropriate weightings are applied to the factors and inserted into the equation.
The total site specific bed load is calculated from:
Bs = Bp(Fl + Fg + Fr + Fp) kg/m2
Bs = 0.05 x([0.9x50%] + [4.2x35%] + [0.4x10%] + [1.2x5%]) kg/m2

PAGE 41 of 54
======================================================================
CD 523 Version 1.0.1
Appendix E/B. Sediment prediction - worked examples
Bs = 0.101 kg/m2 per annum
Paved area = 22.8m (21.5 + paved c/r) x 1,800m
Sediment load = 0.101 x 22.8 x 1,800 kg/m2
Sediment load = 4,145.04 kg
or
4.14 tonnes per annum
or
2.3 kg/m run or 2.3 tonnes per km
The proportion entering the gullies is 40%
Bsg = 0.4 x 4.14 tonnes = 1.66 tonnes
This volume of sediment will either be deposited in the pipe system, or, if not intercepted by a
vegetative treatment system, (see CD 532 [Ref 2.I]), enter the receiving water course.
