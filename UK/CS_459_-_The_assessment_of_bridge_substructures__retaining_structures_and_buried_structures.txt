Revision 1 (March 2020) Update to references only. Revision 0 (May 2019) CS
459 replaces BA 55/06. This full document has been re-written to make it
compliant with the new Highways England drafting rules.The key technical
themes of the update are as follows:1) Some content relevant to assessment
has been moved from previous documents BD21, BA16, BA42, BA87, and
BA88.2) BA55 previously referred extensively to design documents, including
BD30, BD31, BD42 and BD74, that have now been withdrawn and replaced by
Eurocodes and Eurocode-aligned documents. There has therefore been a
need to include and refer to Eurocode content in this document, including a
new option to use a Eurocode-based approach for the basis of assessment. 3)
Some content that is no longer needed has been removed, including models
for dispersal of BD21 loads that were specific to the old loading arrangements.
In the updated version the approaches for dispersal and traffic surcharge can
be applied for any traffic loading model.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
The use of this document enables the safety and serviceability of bridge substructures, retaining
structures and buried structures to be assessed, providing key information that is required to manage
risks and maintain a safe and operational network.
This document covers the assessment of existing structures affected by interaction with the ground or
affected by earth pressures. The development of this document has been influenced by the changes to
the standards that are used for the design of new structures, particularly the introduction of the
Eurocodes, which enabled a unified limit state approach to be taken for the design of both structures
and geotechnics for the first time in the UK.
Assessment of existing structures affected by interaction with the ground was previously undertaken
using a combination of British Standards BS 8002 [Ref 4.N], BS 8004 [Ref 5.N], BS 8081 [Ref 2.N], ISE
CP2 1951 [Ref 7.I], and DMRB documents BD 30/87, BD 31/01, BD 42/00, and BD 74/00, following the
advice in BA 55/06. However, with the implementation of the Eurocodes all conflicting national
standards were withdrawn, including many of the standards and documents that had been used for the
assessment of geotechnical structures. British Standards BS 8002 [Ref 4.N], BS 8004 [Ref 5.N] and
BS 8081 [Ref 2.N] were revised to be fully compatible with Eurocodes and limit state principles.
This document is based on an updating of BA 55/06, and includes the same phased approach of
allowing a qualitative assessment to be used, with an assessment by calculation carried out following
the qualitative assessment only when required.
It has been necessary in this document to allow two different approaches to be used for the
assessment by calculation: one approach is based on the use of CS 454 [Ref 1.N], the second
approach is based on the use of Eurocodes. This document includes an option to use Eurocodes
because the standardised methods for verifying geotechnical ultimate limit states are now found in the
Eurocodes and Eurocode-aligned documents. However, the verification of structural ultimate limit
states can be carried out using CS 454 [Ref 1.N], which can be more convenient to apply for
assessment. Conversely, as many of the partial factors in the Eurocodes are lower than in CS 454 [Ref
1.N], it can be more economic to use the Eurocode-based approach. Hence both options have been
included in this document.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 15.N] apply to this document.

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the assessment of bridge substructures (including bearings, bank
seats, abutments, wing walls, piles and foundations), retaining structures and buried structures.
NOTE 1
This document does not deal with the structural aspects of bridge decks, bridge piers and arches, but it
does cover assessment of their foundations.
NOTE 2
This document includes methods for the assessment of structures and structural elements where their
behaviour is directly influenced by soil-structure interaction or affected by earth pressures.
NOTE 3
In general, the behaviour of substructures is more complex than that of superstructures. Actions applied
to superstructures are largely unaffected by the resulting deformations and movements, whereas earth
pressures at soil / structure interfaces can be influenced by the movement of the structure.
NOTE 4
This document includes specific requirements for the assessment of the following types of structure:
1) spread and piled foundations;
2) gravity retaining structures and non-integral bridge abutments;
3) embedded retaining walls;
4) integral bridge abutments;
5) buried concrete boxes and portal frame structures;
6) corrugated-steel buried structures;
7) reinforced soil structures;
8) dry-stone walls;
9) spandrel walls.
1.1.1
This document may be used for the assessment of associated ancillary structures.
1.2
The assessment of bridge superstructures, including arches, shall be carried out using CS 454 [Ref
1.N].
Implementation
1.3
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the assessment of bridge
substructures, retaining structures and buried structures on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway
and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 15.N].
Use of GG 101

15) ground slope instabilities, in front of and behind the structure;
16) evidence of vehicular impact.
NOTE 1
These requirements supplement those given in CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 2
Principal deficiencies in the substructure can be manifested in the form of excessive movement of the
structure (tilting, sliding, etc.) or of part of it (bulging, differential settlement, etc.) and problems arising
from water seepage.
NOTE 3
Movement of the structure at the soil/structure interface can result from earth pressure changes in the
backfill pressure due to the forward rotation of a retaining wall on its base or soil reaction pressures on
an integral-bridge end support due to temperature generated expansion and contraction of the
supported bridge deck.
NOTE 4
Inspection and maintenance records can sometimes provide useful information regarding hidden or
inaccessible parts of the structure.
2.2.1
Inspections should include both:
1) close inspection methods;
2) inspection from a distance.

CS 459 Revision 1
2. Assessment processes
NOTE 1
Structural defects leading to excessive movement or misalignment can be overlooked during close
inspection but can be apparent from a distance.
NOTE 2
Sighting along restraint systems, handrails, string courses or other features can be used to detect
misalignment.
Defects and structure stability
2.3
The inspection and maintenance records shall be examined for evidence of historical and ongoing
stability problems with the structure.
2.4
Signs of failure in the structure (including signs of distress, damage, deterioration or partial/localised
collapse) and movement in the surrounding ground shall be investigated.
NOTE 1
Evidence of foundation deterioration or failure can be manifested as tilting, distortion or cracking of
elements in other parts of a structure; for example excessive movement at joints between the deck and
abutments.
NOTE 2
Differential movement of a substructure can be easier to detect than the overall movement of a whole
pier or abutment.
NOTE 3
Due to the hidden or sometimes obscured location of these structures, the warning signs of failure
might not be readily visible during a structural inspection.
NOTE 4
In arch bridge foundations, movement or arch spreading is generally apparent from cracks showing
distress in the arch rings and spandrels; diagonal cracking of the arch can be indicative of differential
settlement of the foundations.
NOTE 5
Gross deformations in culverts and buried structures can be evident from instability in the adjacent
embankment or overlying highway.
2.5
Signs of damage to the structure that are due to aggressive ground conditions shall be recorded.
NOTE 1
Further guidance is found in BRE SD-1 2005 [Ref 20.I], which includes information on the assessment
of the surrounding ground, backfill, groundwater and effluent carried by the structure.
NOTE 2
Argillaceous rocks such as shale and mudstone could increase earth pressures on retaining walls by
swelling. They might also release sulphuric acid, putting adjacent concrete structures at serious risk,
and could contribute to the blocking of drainage materials by the formation of crystalline sulphates.
2.5.1
Adjacent structures and buried services in the vicinity should be examined for signs of instability and
distress where this could assist in the assessment process and understanding of the performance of
the structure.
2.6
Where the movement (or the continuing movement) of a structure presents an immediate risk, the
cause of the instability shall be investigated and the structure managed as an immediate risk structure
in accordance with CS 470 [Ref 17.N].
2.6.1
Where a remedial solution is used to stabilise a structure, an instrumentation and monitoring regime
should be implemented to monitor further movement and demonstrate the performance of the solution.
NOTE
The need for instrumentation can depend on the type of remedial solution. In some cases monitoring
without instrumentation can be appropriate.
2.6.2
Where an instrumentation and monitoring regime is used, the monitoring system should allow for
trends in behaviour to be monitored and the results compared with well defined trigger points in a timely
manner so that contingency actions can be implemented prior to a critical condition of instability and
risk to safety occurring.
NOTE 1
Simple visual aids such as tell-tales can be useful to determine if the structure is moving or in a
temporary equilibrium.
NOTE 2
Guidance for the geotechnical monitoring of structures is provided in BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N] and
CIRIA C760 [Ref 14.N].

2. Assessment processes
NOTE 3
A description of available methods for the remote monitoring of highways structures for the purposes of
providing information to assist the management of these structures can be found in TRL PPR 197 [Ref
10.I].
Materials, geometry and loads
2.7
Where the material types used in the construction and filling of the substructure are needed for the
assessment, they shall be established through investigation.
NOTE
Estimation of the material properties for assessment is covered in Section 5.
2.8
Loads due to excessive fill, previous strengthening operations and installation of services shall be
identified and recorded.
2.8.1
Where practical, dimensional checks should be undertaken prior to assessment.
NOTE 1
Dimensional checks can be used to prepare sketches for analysis, estimate permanent loads and
confirm the as-built information.
NOTE 2
Excavation or probing can be used to determine the depth and the extent of the sub-structure and
foundations.
2.9
Excavation or probing shall not adversely affect the stability of the structure or damage any
underground services.
2.9.1
Excavations and sampling should not be undertaken in the case of dry-stone walls.
2.10
Where there is a significant change in the actions on the structure or the structure is being altered, the
extent of the foundation shall be determined, unless it can be demonstrated that knowledge of the
exact foundation extent is not critical to the assessment.
NOTE
A study of realistic ranges of foundation geometries can be used to demonstrate whether the results of
the assessment are sensitive to the assumed geometry.
2.11
Where estimates and assumptions regarding the probable dimensions of the sub-structure, foundations
or retaining wall are made, those estimates and assumptions shall be recorded.
Scour
2.12
Where an inspection for assessment of a structure founded in water is required, underwater inspection
techniques shall be used to confirm the condition and identify defects, including scour.
NOTE 1
Flow of water can cause leaching and scour to foundations and sub-structures.
NOTE 2
Requirements for the assessment of scour and other hydraulic actions at highway structures crossing
or adjacent to waterways are included in BD 97 [Ref 22.I]. Further information can be found in CIRIA
R742 [Ref 16.I].
NOTE 3
The depth of scour holes which can occur during a flood are generally greater than those observed
during periods of slack water. Evidence of the natural refilling of scour holes is sometimes apparent if
material of a coarser or differing nature is present within the scour zone.
NOTE 4
Many arch bridges were built on shallow foundations and are vulnerable to scour.
2.13
Where information regarding the underwater parts of the structure, its foundations or the riverbed is
needed for the assessment or for monitoring of deterioration, underwater photography or imaging shall
be used.
NOTE
Underwater photography or imaging is of particular assistance to the engineer in establishing
conditions below water level. It also serves as a permanent record of the condition at the time of the
inspection and can be subsequently referred to and quoted during the assessment process.
2.14
Unexpected water flows shall be investigated, to determine the cause and any resultant deterioration.

CS 459 Revision 1
2. Assessment processes
Bearings
2.15
The presence or absence of bearings shall be recorded.
2.16
Bearings shall be inspected to obtain information on the following:
1) general condition;
2) binding or jamming;
3) looseness;
4) reaching the limit of rotational or translational movement;
5) condition of seating, bedding and plinth;
6) obstacles preventing correct operation of the bearings.
NOTE
Thermal movements in response to temperature changes can be assessed in accordance with CS 454
[Ref 1.N].
2.16.1
Where no bearings exist or their efficiency is impaired, the ability of a bridge to cater for thermal
movements and forces should be assessed.
NOTE 1
In many early bridges, bearings were either omitted or only rudimentary forms of bearing were provided.
NOTE 2
In bridges without bearings or where the bearings have failed to function correctly, there can be local
crushing or cracking of the supports, especially where they are constructed from stone or brickwork.
Assessment
2.17
The scope of the assessment, including the limit states to be assessed, shall be defined in the AIP in
accordance with CG 300 [Ref 21.N].
2.18
The assessment shall verify whether or not the structure or substructure has sufficient resistance for its
intended use.
2.19
The significance of defects, stability problems, the likely cause and the effect on the sub-structure
resistance shall be evaluated and recorded.
2.20
The assessment shall be based on limit state verifications.
2.20.1
Limit states may include:
1) STR, for example, ULS verification of bending or shear resistance;
2) GEO, for example, ULS verification of sliding, bearing, deep-slip and rotational failures;
3) EQU, for example, ULS verification of overturning;
4) SLS, for example, settlement or crack widths.
2.20.2
The assessment should progress through successive levels of assessment, if needed to demonstrate
the adequacy of the structure or parts of the structure, as follows:
1) qualitative assessment;
2) assessment by calculation;
3) assessment by calculation with updated material parameters or refined analysis models.
2.20.3
The adequacy of the structure may be demonstrated by:
1) applying the same assessment level to the entire structure;
2) applying different assessment levels to parts of the structure.
2.21
A structure, or parts of the structure, whose adequacy has not been demonstrated by a qualitative
assessment or assessment by calculation shall be managed as a substandard structure in accordance
with CS 470 [Ref 17.N].

CS 459 Revision 1
2. Assessment processes
2.21.1
When a superstructure is to be strengthened or replaced, the adequacy of the existing substructure and
foundations may be verified based on:
1) a qualitative assessment according to this document; or
2) calculations using the standards for new design.
Qualitative assessment
2.22
The qualitative assessment shall include an assessment of the following:
1) the condition of the structure, including the extent and severity of defects;
2) the satisfactory past performance in service;
3) whether the behaviour of the structure can be readily understood;
4) anticipated changes in condition, loading or the structural form.
2.22.1
The qualitative assessment of the structure or part of the structure should be taken as satisfactory and
no further assessment is necessary if all of the following apply:
1) there are no signs of significant or worsening distress, damage or deterioration;
2) there is no evidence of scour;
3) satisfactory performance has been demonstrated since construction or significant repairs or
alteration, over a sufficiently long period of time to assess the performance in service;
4) the behaviour of the structure can readily be understood;
5) there are no anticipated modifications to the structure or changes in use.
NOTE
Qualitatively assessing satisfactory performance of a structure or part of a structure in service relies
upon the structure having experienced loading conditions that are representative of those that can be
anticipated over its remaining life, which is more readily justifiable for parts of a structure that
experience predominantly permanent loading than those significantly affected by traffic loading.
2.22.2
The qualitative assessment should be based on an assessment of the performance over a time period
of at least five years, or a shorter period of time where it can be justified that this is sufficient to
understand and assess the performance of the structure in service.
2.22.3
A qualitative assessment may be used to demonstrate the adequacy for changes in the loading where
both of the following apply:
1) there is no net increase in the total action effects;
2) there is no significant reduction in permanent vertical actions that could affect the stability.
2.22.4
Results of previous inspections and assessments should be used to inform the assessment.
2.22.5
Assessment of ground movements should be based upon relevant field data and from experience of
similar structures in similar ground conditions.
2.22.6
A bearing may be assessed to be satisfactory if:
1) its seating shows no sign of distress;
2) movements including rotations are free to take place;
3) there is no significant increase in loading envisaged;
4) there are no signs of significant or worsening distress, damage or deterioration in the bearing and
the structure within the vicinity of the bearing.
Assessment by calculation
2.23
Assessment by calculation shall be undertaken following a qualitative assessment when:
1) the qualitative assessment has not successfully demonstrated adequacy for the structure or part of
the structure at the relevant limit states; and

2) there is an established method of quantitative theoretical assessment available.
NOTE
Assessment by calculation is covered in Section 3.
2.24
The conclusions from the assessment shall be subjected to a plausibility review, to explain differences
between the results of the assessment and the observed condition or performance.
Reporting of the assessment
2.25
The assessment shall be documented in a report summarising the assumptions and methodology of the
assessment, the conclusion of the assessment and recommendations for management interventions.
NOTE
Requirements for reporting assessments are provided in CS 451 [Ref 21.I].
2.25.1
Where the assessment process has included the development of remedial works, for example where
rudimentary maintenance would be sufficient to restore the structure to a state that would be no longer
be substandard, the assessment report should include the details of the proposed remedial works.
Management of substandard structures
2.26
In cases where the final conclusion of the assessment process is that a structure is substandard the
structure shall be managed in accordance with CS 470 [Ref 17.N].
NOTE
Movements or rotations can occur early in the life of the structure and subsequently reach a state of
equilibrium that is no longer a cause for concern.
2.26.1
The observational method may be used to monitor, control or manage movements.
NOTE
Principles and application of the observational method can be found in BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N], CIRIA
R185 [Ref 25.I], CIRIA C760 [Ref 14.N] and TRL Report TRL 228 [Ref 17.I].

Assessment by calculation
Basis of assessment
Scope and methodology
3.1
Where an assessment by calculation is necessary, the scope and methodology for the assessment
shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation and recorded.
3.1.1
The scope and methodology for the assessment should include the following:
1) assessment actions, comprising imposed loads and imposed displacements;
2) assessment properties of soils, rocks and other materials;
3) geometrical data;
4) analysis of the structure and the soil at the relevant limit states for assessment;
5) verifications at the relevant limit states for assessment.
3.1.2
The assessment situations and limit states to be assessed by calculation may be recorded in:
1) the AIP; or
2) the assessment certificate (for example for CAT 0 structures without an AIP).
NOTE
Section 4 includes requirements for assessing specific structure types, additional to the requirements of
this section.
Assessment situations and limit states
3.2
The assessment situations and limit states to be assessed by calculation shall be agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation and recorded.
NOTE 1
Guidance on factors to be included in defining design situations and limit states is included in BS EN
1997-1 [Ref 11.N], which can be used in defining the assessment situations and limit states.
NOTE 2
Limit states can include STR, GEO, EQU and SLS, as covered in Section 2.
3.2.1
The assessment situations and limit states to be assessed by calculation may be recorded in:
1) the AIP; or
2) the assessment certificate (for example for CAT 0 structures without an AIP).
3.2.2
The limit states to be included in the assessment by calculation for the structure or part of the structure
should be defined based on the findings of the qualitative assessment for the structure or part of the
structure.
3.2.3
Verifications of limit states that have already been satisfied using qualitative assessment for the
structure or the part of a structure should be omitted from the assessment by calculation for the
structure or the part of the structure.
NOTE
Verification at the GEO and EQU limit states can often be satisfied qualitatively and omitted from the
assessment by calculation, for example where there is no evidence of settlement, tilting or sliding, and
where the structure is not being modified.
3.2.4
Verifications of serviceability limit states should not be included in the assessment by calculation unless
required in Section 4 or agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Serviceability criteria can be assessed using qualitative assessment or monitoring.
3.3
Assessment situations shall consider both short term and long term conditions.
Options for basis of assessment
3.4
The assessment by calculation for the structure or part of the structure shall be carried out using one of
the two options for basis of assessment set out in Table 3.4a, depending on the limit state being
assessed, as follows:

As defined in CS 454 [Ref 1.N]
γf3 = 1.0 [2]
Note 1: In BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N] Design Approach 1, partial factors are applied to actions and to
ground strength parameters in two combinations, denoted Combination 1 and Combination 2, which
are used for STR and GEO limit states. Combination 2 has lower partial factors on actions, but
applies partial factors to geotechnical parameters that can result in higher effects of geotechnical
actions. Further guidance is provided in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N]
Note 2: When using Option 2 (Eurocodes) there is no γf3 applied to the effects of actions (and the
effect of γf3 has already been included in the calibration of the partial factors on actions as set out in
Table 3.4b). However, if CS 456 [Ref 24.N] is used to assess resistance using Option 2 (Eurocodes)
then γf3 does appear in the formulae for resistance, and setting γf3 to unity avoids the effect of γf3
being double-counted.

provided in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N].
Note 4: The set of partial factors to be used for the EQU limit state is defined in BS EN 1990 [Ref

NOTE
The use of Eurocodes for the design of highway structures is covered in CD 350 [Ref 23.I] which also
includes requirements and advice regarding the use of Eurocodes for assessment.
3.4.1
Either Option 1 or Option 2 in Table 3.4a may be used for the assessment of the STR limit state.
NOTE 1
It can be more convenient to apply Option 1, for example, when assessing abutments or wing walls of a
bridge that is being assessed using CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 2
It can be more economic to apply Option 2, for example, to benefit from lower values of partial factors.
NOTE 3
In CS 454 [Ref 1.N], STR is referred to as ULS.
3.4.2
Either Option 1 or Option 2 may be used for the assessment of structural SLS verifications.
3.5
Option 1 shall not be used for any of the following:
1) assessments of embedded walls;
2) assessments at the GEO limit state;
3) assessments at the EQU limit state;
4) assessments of geotechnical SLS verifications.
3.6
Where the assessment is based on the partial factors for earth pressures in CS 454 [Ref 1.N], the
additional model factor on earth pressure coefficients described in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] shall not be
applied.

3. Assessment by calculation
NOTE
The partial factor for horizontal earth pressure in CS 454 [Ref 1.N] is higher than the partial factor for
vertical earth pressures in CS 454 [Ref 1.N]. This already accounts for the effect included in the
additional model factor described in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N].
Ground properties and geotechnical parameters
3.7
The assessment shall be carried out based on geotechnical parameters that:
1) have been interpreted for the limit state being assessed, and
2) take account of the possible differences between the ground properties and geotechnical
parameters obtained from test results and those governing the behaviour of the structure.
3.7.1
Assessment may be carried out using geotechnical parameters established or estimated from available
site information or default values taken from published literature.
NOTE 1
Parameters established or estimated from available site information is likely to be more reliable and
accurate than default values taken from published literature.
NOTE 2
Further information on ground properties and geotechnical parameters for assessment can be found in
Section 5.
Actions
3.8
Actions for assessment shall be applied in accordance with Table 3.4a.
NOTE
The traffic actions contained in CS 454 [Ref 1.N] includes the rules for the application of impact factors,
transverse separation of vehicles between lanes, traffic flow factors and notional lane factors.
Analysis
3.9
The analysis model shall represent the behaviour of the structure and the ground at the relevant limit
state.
NOTE
The ability of structures to redistribute load can be particularly relevant in assessment. A structure that
is showing local signs of movement or cracking has not necessarily exceeded an ultimate limit state,
particularly for ductile structures.
3.10
The horizontal effects of traffic surcharge actions through the fill shall be based on representative
analyses of the stresses in the soil.
3.10.1
When a more detailed analysis model is not used, the simplified methods in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] may
be used to model the horizontal effects of traffic surcharge actions on structures.
NOTE
The model for traffic surcharge on wingwalls in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] can be used for any wheel load
arrangement and magnitude for assessment according to CS 454 [Ref 1.N] or CS 458 [Ref 23.N]. In
contrast, the model in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] for traffic surcharge on abutments is specific to Eurocode
design load models and can result in excessive earth pressures for assessment purposes.
3.10.2
The model for traffic surcharge on wingwalls in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] may be used for assessing the
horizontal effects of traffic on any retaining structure, including abutments, and applied as follows:
1) draw the arrangement of wheel loads and their positions relative to the structure for the traffic load
case being assessed;
2) omit wheel loads further away than 1.5H from the structure, where H is the height difference
between the application of the wheel load and the base of the wall;
3) to simplify the calculation, group closely spaced wheels into a combined patch load, extending to the
edges of the wheel group, where each patch does not exceed 2.5 m in any direction;
4) calculate the distribution of earth pressures on the wall for each patch using the model for traffic
surcharge on wing walls in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N];
5) superpose the effects of the patches to calculate a total surcharge pressure distribution;

Additional structure-specific assessment requirements
General
4.1
The structure-specific requirements of this section are supplementary to the general requirements and
shall be applied in addition to the requirements elsewhere in this document.
NOTE
This section includes additional requirements for aspects of the assessment of specific structure types.
4.2
Where a structure is supported on a number of individual foundations, the individual foundations shall
be assessed.
4.3
Retaining structures shall be assessed for the effects of an additional minimum surcharge which is:
1) applied to the ground surface on the retained side of the structure;
2) calculated in accordance with BS 8002 [Ref 4.N];
3) not combined with traffic loading; and
4) not applied if it has a relieving effect.
Spread and piled foundations
4.4
Lateral loading of piled foundations shall be assessed where there is a likelihood of soil‑induced
horizontal loading being developed.
NOTE 1
Further information of piles subject to horizontal loading is contained in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N].
NOTE 2
In certain types of locations such as river valleys, the material overlying the founding stratum for the
piles often consists of soft clays, silts, loose sands and gravels and, occasionally, peat. When piled
foundations are used in such ground conditions the possibility of soil induced horizontal loading is high.
NOTE 3
Studies into the effect of lateral loading of piled foundations supporting highway structures have been
carried out for Highways England, the results of which are contained in TRL Project Reports TRL PR
98 [Ref 2.I] and TRL PR 112 [Ref 12.I], and TRL Report TRL 246 [Ref 13.I].
Assessment by calculation of spread and piled foundations
4.5
Where an assessment of spread and piled foundations is carried out by calculation, the assessment
shall be based on representative models suitable for assessment of the relevant limit states and
assessment situations.
4.5.1
The models, methods and recommendations contained in BS 8004 [Ref 5.N] and PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N]
should be used for the assessment of spread and piled foundations by calculation.
NOTE 1
The revised and updated information previously contained in BD 74 is now contained in PD 6694-1 [Ref
20.N].
NOTE 2
Guidance on the determination of horizontal effects on piled foundations can be found in the following
documents.
1) CIRIA R103 [Ref 4.I];
2) Pile Foundation Analysis and Design PFAD [Ref 19.I];
3) TRL Contractor Report TRL CR196 [Ref 24.I]; and
4) TRL Project Report TRL PR 71 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 3
A procedure for the calculation of horizontal effects on piled foundations can be found in Appendix A.
4.6
When horizontal actions due to traction and braking forces or skew effects are included in the
assessment, the assessment shall include a verification of sliding of the foundation as a whole.
NOTE
Sliding can include translation and rotation. Rotational sliding can occur with skewed in-situ structures
and also with eccentric traction.

4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
Gravity retaining structures and non-integral bridge abutments
Assessment by calculation for gravity retaining structures and non-integral bridge abutments
4.7
Where an assessment of a gravity retaining structure or a non-integral bridge abutment is carried out
by calculation, the assessment shall be based on representative models, including earth pressure
coefficients, suitable for assessment of the relevant limit states and assessment situations.
4.7.1
The models contained in BS 8002 [Ref 4.N] and PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] should be used for the
assessment of gravity-retaining structures and non-integral bridge abutments by calculation.
NOTE
The revised and updated information previously contained in BD 30/87 is now contained in PD 6694-1
[Ref 20.N].
Embedded retaining walls
Inspection for assessment for embedded retaining walls
4.8
Where a piling system for an embedded retaining wall includes the use of cement-bentonite piles, the
inspection for assessment shall check for evidence of deterioration or failure, including seepage
through the soft piles.
NOTE 1
Soft cement-bentonite piles can exhibit poor durability.
NOTE 2
Sprayed concrete facings have been used over the exposed sections of soft piles where there has
been a need to enhance durability. Further details can be found in TRL Report TRL 438 [Ref 18.I]
4.9
The inspection for assessment shall include a visual check for signs of movement and distress in the
following elements:
1) the prop slab (or the carriageway over it);
2) the tunnel roof and the lower prop slab (or the carriageway over it) for doubly-propped structures,
such as cut-and-cover tunnels; and
3) the carriageway over the base for structures with a stabilising base.
NOTE
Where there is movement, cracking can develop above the end of the base remote from the wall.
4.10
Where lateral support is provided by ground anchors, the externally accessible elements of the anchors
shall be inspected.
NOTE
Anchor head caps can be provided as part of the structural protection and would need to be removed to
facilitate the inspection of the anchor elements.
4.10.1
Where lateral support is provided by ground anchors, testing may be used to verify the performance or
the load in the ground anchors.
NOTE 1
Lift-off checks can provide an estimate of the load in ground anchors.
NOTE 2
Ground anchors can also be referred to as grouted anchors.
NOTE 3
Guidance on the testing and monitoring the service behaviour of grouted anchors is obtained in BS
8081 [Ref 2.N].
Assessment by calculation for embedded retaining walls
4.11
The assessment of embedded retaining walls by calculation shall include the assessment of the in-situ
stress state, the value of the at-rest earth pressure coefficient, K0 , and the material type, strength and
stiffness.
NOTE 1
The value of K0 can be influenced by the construction process, the flexibility of the retaining wall
system, the in-service period and the depositional and erosional history of the ground.
NOTE 2
Embedded walls that are integral bridge abutments can experience higher earth pressures than K0.
The assessment of integral bridge abutments is covered within Section 4 of this document.

4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
4.11.1
The models, methods and recommendations contained in BS 8002 [Ref 4.N] and CIRIA C760 [Ref
14.N] should be used for the assessment by calculation of embedded retaining walls.
NOTE 1
Guidance on the use of steel sheet piles or H-piles that resist vertical effects is included in SCI P335
[Ref 9.I].
NOTE 2
Guidance on the use of steel sheet piles as bridge abutments can be found in SCI P187 [Ref 3.I]
although aspects of this guide are not aligned to the requirements of the Eurocodes.
4.12
The effects of over-consolidation of soil shall be included in the assessment by calculation of
embedded retaining walls.
4.12.1
Assessment by calculation of embedded retaining walls in over-consolidated soils should include
assessment at the serviceability limit state.
NOTE
The serviceability limit state can be more onerous than the ultimate limit state for walls embedded in
over-consolidated soils.
4.13
The assessment by calculation shall include an assessment of the global and local movements which
have occurred following construction.
4.14
Lateral earth pressure effects due to the effects of backfill compaction and swelling in compacted
cohesive materials shall be taken into account in the assessment.
NOTE
Clayton et. al. Clayton, Hiedra-Cobo & Symons [Ref 14.I] and Clayton, Symons & Hiedra-Cobo [Ref
26.I], TRL Project Report TRL PR 72 [Ref 27.I] and TRL Report TRL 152 [Ref 6.I] provide guidance on
the effects of swelling on earth pressures in compacted cohesive materials.
Integral bridge abutments
Inspection for assessment for integral bridge abutments
4.15
The abutments of integral bridges shall be examined for signs of cracking caused by movements
resulting from the thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge deck.
NOTE 1
Bridge decks with integral abutments experience repeated movements of the abutments in and out of
the backfill as the bridge superstructure expands and contracts with diurnal and seasonal temperature
changes.
NOTE 2
Over a period of time cyclic movements of integral bridge abutments can cause an increase in the
backfill soil stiffness and enhanced earth pressures.
Assessment by calculation for integral bridge abutments
4.16
The assessment of integral bridges shall include an assessment by calculation at the STR limit state,
including assessment of enhanced earth pressures caused by cyclic thermal movements.
NOTE
The enhanced earth pressures on integral bridge abutments can have a significant effect on the whole
structure including the deck.
4.17
The assessment by calculation of integral bridge abutments shall be based on representative models,
suitable for assessment of the relevant limit states and assessment situations, including the
assessment of enhanced earth pressures caused by cyclic thermal movements.
4.17.1
The assessment of earth pressures on integral bridge abutments should be carried out in accordance
with PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] except where modified within this Section 4 of this document.
NOTE
The revised and updated information previously contained in BA 42/96 is now contained in PD 6694-1
[Ref 20.N].
4.17.2
The assessment by calculation of earth pressures on integral bridge abutments should be based on a
range of values of the triaxial effective angle of shearing resistance of the backfill, from the inferior
characteristic value to the superior characteristic value.

4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
NOTE 1
Guidance on evaluating the characteristic values of the triaxial effective angle of shearing resistance of
the backfill using peak and constant volume effective angles of shearing resistance is contained in PD
6694-1 [Ref 20.N].
NOTE 2
An underestimation of ϕ′ can underestimate earth pressures during thermal expansion. An
overestimation of ϕ′ can overestimate the abutment's resistance to longitudinal braking forces.
NOTE 3
In general granular materials comprising compacted rounded particles of uniform grading can have a
peak angle of internal friction, ϕ′ , as low as 35 degrees, and can accommodate thermal expansion
without high earth pressures. However, they are somewhat vulnerable to settlement. Fill of compacted,
well-graded, hard angular particles can have a peak angle of internal friction as high as 55 degrees with
very high resistance to thermal expansion and are less vulnerable to settlement.
4.17.3
Where assessment actions and partial factors are assessed using CS 454 [Ref 1.N], the enhanced
earth pressures due to strain ratcheting should be calculated using the procedures contained in PD
6694-1 [Ref 20.N] but with the design value of the movement dd calculated using Equation 4.17.3.
Equation 4.17.3 Value of the movement where BD21 is used
dd = 1
2dk(1 + γfL)
where:
dk
is the characteristic value of thermal movement calculated in accordance with PD 6694-1
[Ref 20.N], but using the thermal actions given in CS 454 [Ref 1.N].
γfL
is the partial factor for thermal actions (restrained movement) taken from CS 454 [Ref
1.N].
4.18
Enhanced earth pressures shall be applied as a permanent action.
Buried concrete box and portal frame structures
Inspection for assessment for buried concrete box and portal frame structures
4.19
The inspection for assessment of buried concrete box and portal frame structures shall include the
identification of the following:
1) shrinkage cracks on cast in-situ structures;
2) differential settlement;
3) failure in the joints between structural units;
4) deterioration of structural waterproofing and evidence of water ingress;
5) localised deterioration due to detailing faults and poor workmanship during construction;
6) scour and undercutting of the end elevations;
7) subsidence resulting in ground movements in the vicinity of the structure;
8) degradation and deterioration of the reinforced concrete;
9) cracking through excessive loading.
NOTE 1
Management of buried concrete box structures is covered in CM 432 [Ref 15.I]and CS 432 [Ref 11.I].
NOTE 2
Degradation and deterioration of reinforced concrete can occur due to aggressive ground and
groundwater, environmental effects, the aggregate properties and internal composition of the concrete,
reinforcement corrosion and chemical attack.
4.20
Where clearance of silt, debris or vegetation is carried out during an inspection for assessment, the
clearance shall be carried out without damaging the structure.

4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
NOTE 1
Clearance of silt, debris and other vegetation can be necessary in order to inspect the invert of the
structure.
NOTE 2
Silting of an invert commonly occurs with culverts built on waterlogged ground or where ﬂow rates are
low.
Assessment by calculation for buried concrete box and portal frame structures
4.21
The assessment of buried concrete box and portal frame structures shall include an assessment by
calculation at the STR limit state.
4.22
The assessment by calculation for buried concrete box and portal frame structures shall be based on
representative models, suitable for assessment of the relevant limit states and assessment situations,
including the assessment of earth pressures acting on the faces of the structure.
4.22.1
The assessment by calculation of buried concrete box and portal frame structures for which the overall
longitudinal length LL does not exceed 15 m in length and the depth of earth cover HC does not
exceed 11 m should be undertaken based on PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] as modified by Section 4 and
Appendix B of this document.
4.22.2
The assessment by calculation of buried concrete box and portal frame structures for which the overall
longitudinal length LL exceeds 15 m in length may:
1) conservatively be assessed as an integral bridge; or
2) be assessed assuming that the earth pressure at any depth varies linearly between the values for a
buried structure of 15 m overall length to the values for an integral bridge with a 10 m expansion
length.
NOTE 1
Revised and updated design information previously contained in BD 31/01 is now contained in PD
6694-1 [Ref 20.N].
NOTE 2
Figure 4.21.2N2 illustrates the format for the symbols defining the geometry of buried boxes.
Figure 4.22.2N2 Symbols for typical buried box structure
4.23
Assessment of the foundations at the GEO limit state shall be assessed if there is evidence of
settlement, tilting or sliding.
NOTE 1
Tilting of a buried concrete box structure is an extremely unlikely event and can be observed due to the
passage of traffic loading or from the washout of the fill material.
NOTE 2
Tilting and cracking adjacent to the junction of the walls and roof could be indicative of issues arising
from the effects of traction, braking or unbalanced traffic surcharge actions.

NOTE 3
The likelihood of any buried concrete box structure failing by sliding on its base or overturning about
one of its bottom edges is remote.
4.24
Assessment at the STR and GEO limit states for longitudinal traffic actions shall be assessed if there
are signs of tilting or cracking adjacent to the junction of the walls and roof.
NOTE
Signs of tilting, or cracking adjacent to the junction of the walls and roof can be the result of longitudinal
or unbalanced traffic surcharge actions.
4.25
The traffic actions acting on a buried concrete box or portal structure shall be based on the relevant
traffic actions from CS 454 [Ref 1.N] or CS 458 [Ref 23.N], dispersed and applied to the structure in
accordance with this document.
4.26
The dispersal of traffic actions and traffic surcharge actions through the fill shall be based on
representative analyses of the stresses in the soil.
4.26.1
Where a more detailed analysis model is not used, the simplified methods in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] may
be used to model the dispersed vertical effects of traffic actions on structures.
NOTE
The horizontal effects of traffic surcharge loading are covered in Section 3.
4.26.2
The dynamic effects of vehicle loading may be reduced accounting for the damping effect of the depth
of cover.
4.26.3
For normal and restricted traffic modelled using ALL model 1 in CS 454 [Ref 1.N], the impact factor may
be reduced according to Equation 4.26.3.

where:
Fred
is the reduced impact factor
Hc
is the depth of cover in metres
F
is the impact factor taken from CS 454 [Ref 1.N]
4.26.4
For abnormal traffic modelled using CS 458 [Ref 23.N], the dynamic amplification factor may be
reduced according to Equation 4.26.4.

4.27
The permanent action due to the weight of soil acting on the roof of buried box structures and portal
structures shall be assessed based on the weight of the soil and accounting for adverse arching effects
(negative arching).
4.27.1
The supplementary model factor in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] accounting for negative arching may be
omitted from the maximum value of the vertical permanent load where there is no evidence that

4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
4.28
The structure shall be analysed as a continuous frame, with pin joints where the walls are not
continuous or fully integral with the roof slab or base.
4.28.1
The stiffness of any corner fillets may be included in the calculations.
4.28.2
Portal frames should be checked to ensure that they are structurally capable of carrying the applied
loads in conjunction with the frictional resistance forces.
4.29
The horizontal earth pressures acting on the walls of buried concrete box structures and portal frame
structures shall be assessed accounting for the effects of strain ratcheting, wall friction and thermal
expansion and contraction.
4.29.1
The earth pressure coefficients may be assessed using one of the following methods:
1) using directly determined values;
2) by calculation.
4.29.2
When the method of assessment adopts the use of directly determined values, the earth pressures
coefficients should be taken from:
1) Appendix B where the assessment is undertaken to CS 454 [Ref 1.N];
2) PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] where the assessment is undertaken to BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N] and BS EN
1990 [Ref 12.N].
NOTE
The directly determined earth pressure coefficients in Appendix B and PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] include
the effects of strain ratcheting, wall friction and thermal expansion and contraction.
4.29.3
Where the earth pressure coefficients are assessed by calculation, earth pressure coefficients should
be based on geotechnical parameters derived from the results of a geotechnical investigation.
NOTE
Further guidance is provided in PD 6694-1 [Ref 20.N] and BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N].
4.29.4
Where the earth pressure coefficients are assessed by calculation, the enhanced earth pressures due
to strain ratcheting (including Kmin and Kmax ) should be calculated using the requirements for integral
bridge abutments in this document.
Corrugated steel buried structures
Inspection for assessment for CSBS
4.30
The distortion of the CSBS shall be measured.
NOTE
Management of CSBS is covered in CS 460 [Ref 16.N].
4.31
Where the bolts on a CSBS are badly corroded the extent of corrosion shall be measured and
accounted for in the resistance verification.
NOTE
Visual inspection of a core, including a bolt and the surrounding section of the plates that form the
seam can enable measurements to be made on the extent of corrosion.
Assessment by calculation for CSBS
4.32
Corrugated steel buried structures shall be assessed by calculation when any of the following apply:
1) there is evidence of corrosion or deterioration of the corrugated steel exceeding 10% of the
thickness over a substantial area of the structure;
2) there is movement of the structure's profile outside the CS 460 [Ref 16.N] limits for cross section
deviation;
3) the structure exhibits longitudinal distortion.
NOTE
Signs of deterioration in CSBS can include cracking around the boltholes, separation at seams, local
buckling or signs of reverse curvature.

CS 459 Revision 1
4. Additional structure-specific assessment requ...
4.33
Assessment by calculation for CSBS, including checks on wall stress, seam strength and buckling,
shall be undertaken in accordance with the methods and models in CD 375 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 1
The seams in bolted structures are designed to fail in compression through distortion and tearing of the
plates around the bolts, but not through failure of the bolts.
NOTE 2
Bolt failure is one of the potentially catastrophic failure modes because the failure of a single bolt could
lead to load shedding and subsequent overloading of adjacent bolts.
NOTE 3
Determination of material properties suitable for assessment is covered in Section 5.
4.33.1
No deductions should be made for future corrosion of the CSBS in the assessment.
4.33.2
The method contained in CD 375 [Ref 7.N] may be used to predict the future remaining life of the
structure.
4.33.3
Where further information is needed for the assessment of a CSBS, guidance should be sought from
the manufacturers or other specialists to assist in the assessment of CSBS.
NOTE
Corrugated steel buried structures are proprietary manufactured structures and the design could have
been undertaken by the manufacturer or other specialist as part of the structure procurement.
4.34
The assessment of CSBS outside the scope of CD 375 [Ref 7.N] shall be agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation.
4.35
The assessment of a CSBS whose shape is outside the deviation limits for cross section, or exhibits
longitudinal distortion, shall be based on an analysis method that accounts for the effect of the
distortion.
NOTE 1
In most cases, the greater the deviation from the nominal cross section the greater the loss in capacity;
and the larger the span, the greater the sensitivity to deformation.
NOTE 2
Assessment of a structure that has suffered longitudinal distortion can require specialised analysis.
NOTE 3
Longitudinal distortion can be caused by differential settlement or by mining subsidence.
4.35.1
Where longitudinal distortion has occurred, the calculation of the area of section and the second
moment of area should include the effects of hogging strains in the longitudinal direction.
NOTE
Hogging strains can reduce the area and second moment of area of corrugated sections.
Reinforced soil structures
Assessment by calculation for reinforced soil structures
4.36
Reinforced soil structures shall be assessed by calculation where there is reliable as-built information
on the fill and the reinforcement properties and layout, and:
1) there are signs of movement or cracking; or
2) there is evidence of corrosion or some other form of deterioration of the reinforcement exceeding
that allowed for in the design.
NOTE 1
There are two resistance elements providing global stability in reinforced soil structures (the soil and
the reinforcement). It is unlikely that there will be signs of movement or cracking at the facing unless
there is loss of strength in the soil or the reinforcement.
NOTE 2
Reinforced soil structures can suffer local failure of the facing, without danger of global failure, where
the reinforcement attached to the rear of the facing fails due to local corrosion or some other form of
deterioration in non-metallic elements.
NOTE 3
For anchored earth structures, the facing panels can play a major role in providing global stability.
4.36.1
Assessment by calculation of reinforced soil structures and soil nail structures should be undertaken in
accordance with BS 8006-1 [Ref 3.N] and BS 8006-2 [Ref 6.N].

NOTE 1
For complex structures involving reinforced soil and soil nails, both BS 8006-1 [Ref 3.N] and BS 8006-2
[Ref 6.N] can be needed.
NOTE 2
Strengthened and reinforced soil structures is not covered in BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N].
4.36.2
Where further information is needed for the assessment of a reinforced soil structure, guidance may be
sought from the manufacturers or other specialists.
NOTE
Reinforced soil structures, or components of, are proprietary manufactured structures and the design
could have been undertaken by the manufacturer or other specialist as part of the structure
procurement.
Dry-stone walls
4.37
Dry-stone walls shall be assessed qualitatively.
4.37.1
The assessment of dry-stone walls should be based upon the results of visual inspections and surveys.
4.38
The inspection for assessment of dry-stone walls shall include the identification of the following:
1) the type, size and shape of stone(s);
2) the age of the wall;
3) the skill with which the stones have been laid or replaced;
4) signs of bulging or loss of profile;
5) stone loss, particularly at the top of the wall;
6) the likely nature of the retained material supporting the wall foundations;
7) the existing loads carried by the wall(s) in terms of traffic volume;
8) the presence (in and around the wall) of vegetation; and
9) influence of trees and vegetation on the wall stability.
NOTE 1
Qualitative judgements are difficult since conditions will vary greatly with the quality of stone used, age,
subsoil conditions, geometry, weathering factors and local expectations.
NOTE 2
Advice on the interpretation of the observations from the visual inspection, the seriousness of the
various defects which can occur and the application to the assessment for dry-stone walls is contained
in Appendix D.
4.39
Assessment of dry-stone walls shall include a comparison with the performance of adjacent structures.
4.39.1
Local experience of the behaviour and comparison with past performance of the structure should be
used to inform the assessment when available.
Masonry spandrel walls
4.40

Properties of materials and drainage
Geotechnical information
5.1
Geotechnical information and data obtained for the assessment process shall identify the properties of
the geotechnical materials so that any risks can be identified and the structure managed.
5.1.1
Geotechnical information should be obtained from desk studies and/or geotechnical investigations.
NOTE
Geotechnical information can be established from existing or newly obtained geotechnical data.
5.1.2
Where geotechnical information exists, the information may be reassessed by carrying out further
studies and investigation to refine the understanding, obtain more reliable values and extend the
knowledge of the ground for the purpose of the assessment.
5.2
Geotechnical investigation shall be undertaken when it is required for the assessment.
5.2.1
Geotechnical investigations should be carried out if the information obtained can improve the reliability
of the assessment.
NOTE 1
Desk studies are normally sufficient for the purpose of a qualitative assessment.
NOTE 2
Geotechnical investigations are unlikely to be required unless there is a requirement for an assessment
by calculation.
5.2.2
The geotechnical investigation should gather relevant knowledge about the site required for the
assessment including:
1) establishment of the geotechnical material and groundwater conditions;
2) determination of the properties of the geotechnical materials; and
3) the pore pressure distributions.
5.2.3
The planning and reporting of ground investigations, interpretation and evaluation of test results, and
the derivation of values of geotechnical parameters and coefficients should be carried out in
accordance with BS EN 1997-2 [Ref 8.I].
5.3
Where geotechnical information is required for the assessment, the geotechnical activities shall be
certified in accordance with CD 622 [Ref 18.N].
Structural materials
5.4
Properties of structural materials and cross sections, including the effects of deterioration and damage,
shall be determined in accordance with:
1) CS 454 [Ref 1.N] when assessment by calculation is undertaken to Option 1;
2) BS EN 1990 [Ref 12.N] and BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N] when assessment by calculation is
undertaken to Option 2 (Eurocode); and
3) the relevant material standards.
NOTE 1
CS 454 [Ref 1.N], CS 455 [Ref 22.N] and CS 456 [Ref 24.N] provide requirements for structural material
properties, including the effects of deterioration and damage, for assessment by calculation to Option 1.
NOTE 2
BS EN 1990 [Ref 12.N], BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 8.N], BS EN 1993-2 [Ref 9.N], BS EN 1994-2 [Ref 10.N]
and BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 11.N] provide requirements for structural and geotechnical material properties,
including the effects of deterioration and damage, for assessment by calculation to Option 2 (Eurocode).
NOTE 3
Where measurement of the present cross section is not feasible, such as for buried elements,
estimates of the loss in section can be made with reference to published literature taking into account
the age of the structure.
5.5
Where estimates of the cross-sectional loss are made, the method of estimation and the assumed loss
shall be recorded.

5. Properties of materials and drainage
5.6
The estimated degradation of exposed components and surfaces shall include an assessment of the
effects of the following:
1) aggressivity of the ground;
2) groundwater (where present);
3) corrosivity of the atmosphere.
NOTE
With water, oxygen, organic matter and salt all likely to be in regular contact the conditions prevailing at
the exposed component and surfaces of structures can be more onerous then those applicable to
buried components.
Drainage
5.7
The assessment shall include a review of the effectiveness of the surface and sub-surface drainage
provisions to the structure, including drainage provided to intercept and convey surface water away
from an earth retaining structure or the backfill.
NOTE 1
As-built drawings can indicate the drainage provisions that were originally intended.
NOTE 2
Facilities can be present for rodding the drainage system from inspection manholes, which can be
positioned at the foot of a wall.
NOTE 3
Weep holes located just above ground level can provide a visual check that the system is functioning
correctly, and can limit the rise in water level in the event of a drainage failure.
5.7.1
Where the drainage system is not functioning effectively, the consequences of malfunction of the
drainage system should be reviewed and included in the assessment.
5.7.2
The following features should be noted, with respect to changing groundwater levels:
1) the possibility of rise in pore water pressures caused by malfunction of the drainage system or
resulting from fracture of water mains located in the vicinity;
2) rising groundwater levels, particularly in urban environments, and their effect on the long-term
magnitude and distribution of water pressures;
3) damage to adjacent structures due to depression of the water table.
5.7.3
The following features should also be noted:
1) whether the vertical drainage layer (where present) has a direct connection with the drainage pipes;
2) whether suitable exits with positive outfall are provided for any drainage system;
3) whether drains are oversized to allow for blockage during working life to enable better access for
rodding.
NOTE
In highly permeable backfill a vertical drainage layer can be absent.

Appendix A. Lateral loading of piles
Appendix A. Lateral loading of piles
A1
General
The following procedure can be used for the determination of soil‑induced lateral loading effects on
piles for assessment.
A1.1
Step 1
Analyse the behaviour of the soil cross‑section to obtain the soil displacements over the length of the
piles but omitting the pile structural elements and the pile actions transferred from the structure.
Any numerical method capable of analysing non-linear soil behaviour may be used for this purpose.
Soil displacements should be calculated at the position of the piles perpendicular to the pile shaft along
the length of the piles.
About 10 regularly spaced deflection points along each pile should be sufficient although more may be
needed to accurately represent the deflected shape of the piles.
A1.2
Step 2
The soil displacements calculated in Step 1 should be applied to the individual piles as lateral
displacements with due regard to their end fixities considering each pile as a free-standing frame
element without the surrounding soil.
Only differential displacements, that is displacements with respect to one end of the pile, should be
used and input as imposed displacements on the structural element.
Any continuous beam or frame analysis structural software package can be used for this.
The points at which the displacements should be applied need to correspond with the soil displacement
points selected in Step 1.
The output reactions represent the magnitude of the action required to produce the calculated
displacement profile of the piles.
A1.3
Step 3
Calculate the lateral pressures developed along the piles which would result due to the applied
deflections.
The lateral pressures can be obtained by dividing the calculated reaction at each displacement point by
the contributing pile area, that is the length of pile taken as the mid-point distance between adjacent
displacement nodes multiplied by the diameter or the width of the pile.
If in any part of the pile this pressure exceeds the yield stress, py , of the soil, the excess pressure
should be redistributed uniformly along the remainder of the pile.
Each pile should then to be analysed using the redistributed total pressure as the applied pressure.
The yield stress, py , of the soil can be taken as the greater of Equation A.1 and A.2 according to the
response of the material.

Appendix A. Lateral loading of piles
Equation A.1 Yield stress of cohesionless soils for pile analysis
py = 3Kpσ′
v
where:
py
is the yield stress of the soil
Kp
is the coefficient of passive earth pressure
σ′
v
is the effective vertical stress
Equation A.2 Yield stress of cohesive soils for pile analysis
py = 9cu
where:
py
is the yield stress of the soil
cu
is the undrained shear strength
A1.4
Step 4
The effects of actions (shear forces and bending moments) and any other effects calculated in the piles
at the end of the Step 4 should be superimposed on the effects in the pile determined from the pile
analysis of the actions transferred to the piles from the structure.
Partial factors can be applied to the effects of actions in accordance with the code provisions to
calculate the design effects of actions for both the ultimate and serviceability limit states.
A1.5
Notes
The above procedure is a conservative method to calculate lateral forces and moments induced into a
single pile as it has the following simplifications:
1) It makes the assumption that the presence of the pile does not influence the ground movement;
2) It does not allow for soil yield and flow around the pile;
3) No allowance is made for increase in strength as the soil consolidates under the embankment
surcharge.
The method can be refined by using "link elements" which model interaction between the soil and the
pile (for example, Geotechnique Vol. 44, 2, p277 [Ref 5.I]).
Appendix A of TRL TRL PR 71 [Ref 1.I] describes various design approaches and their advantages and
limitations.

Appendix C. Dry-stone walls
Appendix C. Dry-stone walls
C1
Construction and behaviour
Dry-stone walls are normally constructed without recognisable foundations and out of marginal quality
material. Only the front face contains dressed masonry, the remainder usually being rubble.
Dry-stone walls were constructed as facing walls to vertical or near vertical cuts in unstable or friable
material or as free-standing burr and retaining walls. In the latter cases construction and backfilling
proceeded together.
The absence of mortar results in stone to stone contact, and since the stones used in the walls are
usually irregular or roughly squared off, point contact between stones is common.
Contact pressure may be high especially at the base of tall stones and crushing is often evident.
Dry-stone walls can move and distort until sufficient interlock strength has been gained between stones.
This can give an irregular profile however the wall can still provide satisfactory performance in service.
The open nature of a dry-stone wall permits weathering of the face and in the open joints, reducing the
area of contact and encouraging further crushing.
Percolation of ground water and waterborne salts through the fabric of the wall results in weathering
and the leaching of fines from within the structure.
Salt spray resulting from deicing salts may cause deterioration in the fabric of the lower parts of the wall.
Weathering occurs more in some areas of wall than in others due to the very variable quality of the
masonry used.
Random weathering and unsatisfactory foundations results in differential settlements, movements and
bulging which induces acute stresses in some elements of the structure causing cracking whilst
elsewhere stones become loose and may be dislodged.

Construction and behaviour
Spandrel walls are normally formed from dressed material and suffer the normal problems associated
with exposed masonry such as weathering, loss of pointing and so forth. In addition, deterioration of
bridge spandrels is frequently a function of permanent and variable lateral actions generated through
the bridge infilling or as a result of direct vehicular impact. In both cases some outward movement is
caused.
Lateral actions may cause the wall to rotate outward from the arch barrel, to slide on the arch barrel, to
be displaced bodily outwards whilst taking part of the arch ring with it, or to bulge (see Figure D.1).
Figure D.1 Masonry spandrel wall failures
Dry-stone spandrel walls are not common. Where they occur there are difficulties, which are similar to
those of dry-stone retaining walls, but the effects of variable actions are more significant.
Spandrel walls are more vulnerable to damage or displacement if no footway exists to restrain vehicles
passing close to the side of the bridge. Without footpaths, vehicular impact is more likely and the
effects of the lateral actions generated by the vehicle through the bridge fill may be more acute.

Poor bridge drainage may also be a feature leading to deterioration of the spandrel, particularly if
saturation of the bridge fill occurs. Work on Statutory Undertakers' and Private Utilities' equipment
passing through the bridge may also lead to deterioration of the spandrels by permitting an increase of
water percolation into the fill, thereby reducing the shear strength of the fill.
