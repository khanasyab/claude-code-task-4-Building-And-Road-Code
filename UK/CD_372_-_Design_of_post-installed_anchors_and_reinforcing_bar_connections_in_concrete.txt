Introduction
Introduction
Background
Post-installed fixings in concrete, which include mechanical and bonded anchors and bonded
reinforcing bars, are regularly used in works relating to highway structures.
Fixings can offer a cost-effective solution for making attachments or extensions to new and existing
concrete structures. The use of fixings can mitigate the need for extensive breakout of the parent
concrete. They can also have benefits in reducing disruption to the highway network, reducing
requirements for traffic management and reducing the duration of the construction programme.
Post-installed fixings are used for a wide range of applications, including fixing ancillary equipment to
concrete surfaces, attaching environmental barriers to structures, provision of extensions to concrete
elements such as construction of new parapet upstands, strengthening or extending foundations and
substructures, fixing temporary works to the edge of bridges to facilitate parapet replacement, and
attaching walkways to the sides of structures.
Recent guidance ( CIRIA C778 [Ref 5.I]) highlights that fixings can introduce risks in the long term
management of structures, and that effective management of risks is greatly influenced by the design
and the quality of installation of fixings.
This document gives requirements and supportive advice for the design of post-installed fixings in both
new and existing concrete structures, providing key information that is required to manage risks and
maintain a safe and serviceable network, and implements the recommendations made in CIRIA C778
[Ref 5.I] for the design of new fixings to ensure they can be effectively managed in the future and to
minimise the future risk of the fixings.
In addition to the content formerly in IAN 104/15 and CD 372 revision 0, appropriately updated to reflect
the current EU and UK standards, requirements and advice on the conceptual design of fixings have
been added, and construction and installation requirements have been moved to CC 482 [Ref 28.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 20.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a British Standard,
technical specification or quality mark, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual
Recognition clause in GG 101 [Ref 20.N].

Concept design of fixing system
Identification
2.1
The inclusion of post-installed fixings on a structure shall be identified during the design process.
NOTE 1
Early identification of potential need for fixings is important because it allows a coherent design to be
developed that minimises long-term risks and maintenance effort associated with fixings.
NOTE 2
In some cases (for example, when designing a new tunnel) it is possible and desirable to identify the
need for post-installed fixings at an early stage, for example, during structural concept design.
NOTE 3
In other cases (for example the design of a new CCTV system to be connected to an existing bridge),
the need for post-installed fixings can only be identified when the requirement for the fixture is defined,
for example, during a modification or improvement project.
NOTE 4
Common situations where post-installed fixings are required are included in Table 2.1N4:
Table 2.1N4 Indicative locations where post-installed fixings can be required
Post-installed anchors
Post-installed reinforcing bar connections
Mechanical and electrical systems
Column strengthening
Lighting
Structural element to be cast in stages
Signage
Extension of an existing structure
Communications
New plinths for safety barrier / lighting column
Ventilation systems
Bearing plinth replacement
Cladding system
Classification
2.2
Post-installed fixings shall be classified as either safety critical or non-safety critical.
NOTE 1
It is desirable and useful to undertake the classification at an early stage because this provides greater
opportunity to mitigate or eliminate the risks associated with a safety critical fixing.
NOTE 2
The classification as safety critical or non-safety critical affects the following:
1)
how a post-installed anchor/reinforcing bar is tested;
2)
the information that needs to be provided for technical approval; and/or
3)
how it is managed in the future.
2.2.1
The classification should be undertaken using Table 2.2.2.
2.2.2
Where the response to any of the questions in Table 2.2.2 is 'yes' then the fixing should be classified as
safety critical.

not safety critical. For example, progressive failure does not always lead to loss of life or significant
economic loss.
NOTE 3
Table 2.2.2 is taken from CIRIA C778 [Ref 5.I]. Further guidance and examples on classifying fixings is
provided in CIRIA C778 [Ref 5.I].
2.2.3
Where there is uncertainty in responding to the questions in Table 2.2.2, the fixings should be classified
as safety critical.
2.2.4
Where there is an extremely high degree of redundancy such that failure of the fixing cannot lead to the
adverse consequences listed in Table 2.2.2, and failure of multiple fixings by a common mode is not
conceivable, then the fixings may be classified as non-safety critical.
NOTE 1
Redundancy contributes to achieving robustness, but there have been examples where the same
mode of failure has affected numerous fixings on an installation, negating the benefits of redundancy.
Therefore, the potential consequence of failure is more important in classifying a fixing or group of
fixings as safety critical or non-safety critical, than is the exact degree of redundancy.
NOTE 2
Appendix A provides examples of situations that illustrate how the degree of redundancy can be related
to the safety critical classification.
Technical approval of fixings
2.3
Proposals for safety critical fixings shall be subject to technical approval in accordance with CG 300
[Ref 31.N].
NOTE 1
Technical approval provides the technical approval authority the opportunity to identify and assess the
effect on future management, ensures that maintenance arrangements can be set out, and triggers
inclusion of the fixings within the asset record.
NOTE 2
Proposals for new fixings on new structures can be recorded in the CG 300 [Ref 31.N] Approval in
Principle (AIP) (or equivalent) for the structure.
NOTE 3
Proposals for new fixings associated with other elements requiring AIP, such as mechanical and
electrical installations, can be recorded in the mechanical and electrical AIP (or equivalent), including
the effect of the fixing on the structure.
2.3.1
The following design details for safety critical fixings should be provided for technical approval:
1)
the fixture supported;
2)
the location on the structure;

2. Concept design of fixing system
3)
the design working life of the fixing;
4)
the future maintenance arrangements;
5)
safe removal of the fixing of the end of its working life.
NOTE
Requirements for design working life are given in Section 3. The respective design working life of the
fixture and fixing can need early consideration to ensure that the proposals are viable, particularly
where a design working life in excess of 50 years is required of the fixing.
Mitigating risks of fixings at concept design
2.4
Safety critical fixings shall only be proposed in the design where alternative connection methodologies
are not viable.
NOTE 1
Safety critical fixings introduce the potential for a failure with high consequence and require greater
future management effort.
NOTE 2
Appendix A provides example of indicative strategies to eliminate safety critical fixings from the design.
2.5
Where safety critical fixings are proposed, the following measures shall be incorporated in the design
and recorded in the CG 300 [Ref 31.N]AIP:
1)
measures to reduce the consequence of failure; and
2)
measures to minimise the residual risk factors that affect the likelihood of future degradation of
fixings
2.6
The residual risk factors that affect the likelihood of future degradation of fixings shall be minimised by
incorporating mitigation measures in the design.
NOTE 1
At the concept design stage, of the structure or of the fixing system, there can be an opportunity to
make design decisions that reduce the long term probability of failure of a fixing.
NOTE 2
Although anchors qualified with a European technical assessment (ETA) or UK technical assessment
(UKTA) have a notional design working life, there is potential for the real working life to be shorter
depending on design, execution, environment, use and maintenance conditions.
2.6.1
Mitigation measures to minimise the residual risk factors should be developed during the design by:
1)
understanding the applicable risk factors;
2)
confirming which of the risk factors apply to the proposed design; and
3)
reviewing whether a different design approach could reduce or remove the risk factor.
NOTE
Appendix A provides a summary of indicative risk factors and implications for concept design of fixing
systems.
Effect of fixings on structure
Loads transferred to structure
2.7
It shall be verified that the structure is able to withstand the design actions imposed through fixings, in
combination with other actions.
NOTE 1
The fixing design method results in minimum edge distances, spacing and member thickness that are
necessary to achieve the intended resistance of the fixing.
NOTE 2
In addition, actions imposed by the fixing can induce load effects such as moments, shears or torsion
into the structure that need to be checked more remotely from the fixing particularly for slender
members.
2.7.1
The design should provide a hierarchy of strength in the following cases:
1)
where the design load on a fixture is a notional accidental action that can be exceeded in practice;

CD 372 Version 1.0.0
2. Concept design of fixing system
2)
where accidental impact on the fixture is conceivable even if there is no explicit accidental design
load; and
3)
where the failure of a fixture through concrete failure has potential to disproportionately
compromise the structural integrity of the wider structure;
NOTE 1
The concept of providing a hierarchy of strength requires there to be an explicit 'weakest element' in the
structural system and then designing other elements to be stronger; this approach can assist in
avoiding costly repairs to the main structural elements.
NOTE 2
Normal design of a fixing results in the actual fixing providing a design resistance equal to or greater
than the design action. Therefore, if the design action of the fixing is also used in the structural design,
there can be a possibility that the fixing is overloaded and at failure imposes a higher load and
damages the structure.
NOTE 3
Where accidental actions are not involved and there is no potential for disproportionate damage, then
the normal partial factors used in design provide an adequate level of structural reliability and there is
no need to provide an explicit hierarchy of strength.
NOTE 4
This is a principle commonly used in the design of parapets. In the design of connections of vehicle
parapets with actions in accordance with BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 2.I], the parapet post is designed as the
weakest element. Both the structure and the fixing are designed for the failure load of the parapet, but
there is no need for the structure also to be stronger than the fixing.
2.7.2
A hierarchy of strength may be provided by taking the design action (applied to other elements) to be
equal to the characteristic resistance of the weakest element and factoring by 1.25.
2.7.3
Where the fixing is intended to be the weakest element, then the characteristic resistance of the fixing
may be defined and specified as an upper limit.
NOTE 1
In practice, the fixing can be selected at a late stage of the structure design so it can be more practical
to verify the structure against an assumed upper limit of fixing strength, rather than determine the exact
fixing strength at this stage.
NOTE 2
Specification of internally threaded sockets can facilitate the rapid replacement of a damaged
attachment or bolt.
Reduced resistance due to drill holes
2.8
The structural resistance of the structure shall be derived taking into account the holes to be drilled for
the fixings.
2.9
Fixings shall not be installed in locations where there is a risk of damage to a prestressing strand,
prestressing tendons or prestressing bars.
2.10
Where it is likely or intended that reinforcement is hit during drilling, then assumptions for lost
reinforcement section area shall be defined and the assumed lost section area excluded from the
verification.
2.11
Where it is assumed that the reinforcement remains undamaged during drilling, then this assumption
shall be communicated clearly in the specification and drawings.
2.11.1
Where it is assumed that reinforcement is to be located on site prior to drilling and fixing locations
revised to avoid reinforcement, then the fixture or support framework should be designed to
accommodate the relocation of fixings.
2.12
Where it is proposed to install multiple fixings in line, then the resistance of the element shall be verified
taking into account the potential for a plane of weakness.
Avoidance of damage
2.13
The proposed drill holes shall be capable of being made without wider damage to the concrete
substrate.

2. Concept design of fixing system
NOTE
For example, there is potential for the drilling to 'burst out' the rear of thin concrete sections.
2.14
Where it is proposed to install a fixing through bridge deck waterproofing, then the integrity of the
waterproofing shall be maintained.
2.14.1
The design should include measures to repair and reinstate the waterproofing that assure the integrity
of the joint with the existing waterproofing.
Design for testing following installation including provision of sacrificial fixings
2.15
The fixing system shall be designed to allow for proof testing following installation.
NOTE 1
Requirements for proof testing are given in Section 3.
NOTE 2
Space is needed for the testing equipment, including jacks, load transfer arrangement, and space for
the tester.
2.15.1
Where testing of the works fixings is not possible due to geometrical constraints, sacrificial fixings may
be provided and tested.
2.15.2
Sacrificial fixings should be located on the structure in the vicinity of the works fixings.
2.15.3
Sacrificial fixings should replicate the conditions and installation methods of the works fixings.
2.15.4
The design of the fixing system should incorporate physical measures to enable proof testing following
installation including:
1)
fixture/connection designed to enable testing, for example, detailing an extended thread to allow
for attachment of a testing rig, or allowing for testing without removal of the fixture; and
2)
space to allow for the testing rig, which can include a spreader beam.
2.16
Where the provision of sacrificial fixings for testing following installation are proposed in the
design,details of the proposed sacrificial fixings for testing shall be recorded within the design outputs
in accordance with CD 350 [Ref 32.N].
Design for robustness
2.17
Fixing systems that include safety critical fixings shall be designed with a defined strategy to provide
robustness.
NOTE
Robustness is a defined term; refer to 'Terms and Definitions'.
2.17.1
Strategies to provide robustness may include:
1)
segmentation, to limit the extent of failure;
2)
limiting the exposure of the fixing to adverse and unforeseen events; and
3)
redundancy, to allow load to be transferred in the event of failure of an element of the fixing
system.
NOTE 1
Segmentation means dividing the fixing system into structurally-independent sections, such that a
failure of one section is not transmitted into the next section.
NOTE 2
In some cases it can be possible to reduce the exposure of a fixing by adjusting its location, for
example in relation to accidental impacts.
NOTE 3
Failure case studies show that there is potential for common-cause failure where the same failure
mode can apply to large numbers of similar fixings. In the case of such systematic failures, a high
overall factor of safety or high level of redundancy are not necessarily sufficient to prevent failure.
2.17.2
The fixing system design may allow for identifiable deformation to occur following failure of an element
of the system, prior to total failure.
NOTE 1
The provision of a ductile system can allow initial failures to be detected by inspections and acted upon
prior to overall failure.

CD 372 Version 1.0.0
2. Concept design of fixing system
NOTE 2
Such identifiable deformation can be provided through deformation of support frameworks, or
movement of secondary restraints, or load indicating elements.
2.18
Fixing systems for permanent works that include safety critical fixings shall be designed to
accommodate a failure of any single safety critical fixing as an accidental design situation, without
collapse of the fixture.
2.18.1
For the failure cases, the partial factors relevant to the accidental design situation should be applied, in
accordance with BS EN 1990 [Ref 17.N].
2.18.2
For all the failure cases, the remaining elements of the fixing system (such as base-plate, support
framework, and other fixings) should be designed to carry the redistributed loads consistent with the
failure cases.
NOTE
The critical design actions on fixings can be generated by this redistribution case, which is checked to
avoid the possibility of an 'unzipping' progressive failure.
2.18.3
A secondary restraint system may be an option to protect against failure of a primary fixing.
NOTE
Examples of secondary restraint include:
1)
lanyards;
2)
safety chains;
3)
a corbel or other structural device to 'catch' the fixture; and
4)
a crash deck.
2.18.4
Where a secondary restraint is provided, the design of the restraint and associated fixings should
include for dynamic effects, where there is potential for the fixture to drop due to slack before the
restraint is mobilised.
NOTE 1
The actions on a fixing providing secondary restraint can be different to those on a primary fixing, and
hence a different size or type of fixing can be needed.
NOTE 2
There can be beneficial improvements in robustness in selecting a different type of fixing for a
secondary restraint system compared with the primary fixings, since this reduces the possibility of the
same risk factors, degradation or failure mechanisms applying to both sets of fixings.
2.18.5
Where a secondary restraint is provided, the fixture should not be able to move to a position that can
cause harm to persons or traffic when the restraint is mobilised.
Design to facilitate future management
General
2.19
The fixing system shall be designed to facilitate future management.
NOTE 1
Decisions taken during the design phase can have a significant impact on how the fixing is managed in
future.
NOTE 2
The purpose of designing to facilitate future management is to make provisions in design that can
enable an appropriate management regime to be followed in order that a tolerably low level of risk is
maintained through the life of the fixing.
NOTE 3
The following sub-sections provide requirements that facilitate future management under the following
headings:
1)
design for inspection;
2)
design for future testing in service; and
3)
design for end-of-life.
Design for inspection
2.20
The fixing system and fixings shall be designed to facilitate future inspection.

CD 372 Version 1.0.0
2. Concept design of fixing system
2.20.1
Anchors should be observable without special access equipment.
NOTE
General inspections are visual inspections undertaken without special access equipment. It is desirable
that information on anchors can be obtained from general inspections, in particular, signs of distortion,
corrosion or cracking of the substrate.
2.20.2
Anchors should be accessible at touching distance using a viable means of access.
NOTE
Touching distance access is required for principal inspections. Touching distance access is also
important if investigations are required into condition or performance of the fixing.
2.20.3
Space should be provided around the fixing system to allow for the means of access and the inspector.
NOTE
Where equipment is suspended from fixings, then access to the fixing using elevated platforms can be
prevented by the size and position of the equipment.
2.20.4
Joints between concrete elements connected using post installed reinforcement should be observable
from at least one side.
NOTE
Signs of degradation of the post installed reinforcement can become visible at the surface of the joint. It
is not possible to inspect the post installed reinforcement directly when it is used to connect two
concrete elements.
2.21
Safety critical anchors shall not be hidden.
NOTE
Guidance is provided in CIRIA C764 [Ref 4.I] on managing hidden defects in bridges. The report
defines a hidden component as one that can not usually be visually inspected as part of a principal
inspection. Components are hidden if they are inaccessible for inspection without excavation or
removal of material or other structural components.
2.22
Where the proposed access requires removal of panels for remote imaging such as endoscopes, then
justification for the proposed means of access shall be provided.
Design for future testing in service
2.23
The benefits of including measures to enable future testing of safety critical fixings in service shall be
evaluated.
NOTE 1
Future testing refers to in service testing during the design working life, rather than to proof testing
following installation.
NOTE 2
The extra costs of including measures to enable testing can be relatively low if included from the start.
Such measures can provide a future contingency for testing that could provide assurance that a fixing
continues to achieve a certain resistance over time.
NOTE 3
The potential benefits of future testing in service are highest when some or all of the following apply:
1)
high consequences of failure;
2)
large number of similar fixings;
3)
potential for degradation of the substrate or aspects of the substrate performance or strength are
unknown (more likely in a retrofit application than a new structure);
4)
permanent actions carried by the fixing are a low proportion of the design action (for example,
when the fixing is intended to perform in an accidental design situation such as a vehicle impact);
and/or
5)
the replacement of fixings would be particularly challenging.
NOTE 4
Load testing in service can be a costly and disruptive activity. In some cases access and traffic
management costs can be comparable for installation of new fixings.
NOTE 5
Guidance on planning for future load testing of anchors during service is provided in CIRIA C778 [Ref
5.I].

2. Concept design of fixing system
2.24
Where measures to enable future testing of safety critical fixings in service are proposed in the design,
the proposed measures to enable future testing of safety critical fixings in service shall be recorded in
the design outputs in accordance with CD 350 [Ref 32.N].
2.25
Where measures to enable future testing of safety critical fixings in service are proposed, then the
measures shall be documented in the maintenance records as defined in CG 302 [Ref 1.N].
2.25.1
Where measures to enable future testing of safety critical fixings are proposed, a future testing strategy
should be produced and included in the records, including:
1)
type of tests (for example, proof test);
2)
frequency of tests;
3)
location of tests;
4)
magnitude of test load(s);
5)
envisaged test method, including access and means of applying load;
6)
action to be taken in the event that the test load is not achieved; and
7)
action to be taken in the event of damage to the fixing or substrate during the test.
2.26
The frequency of future tests such that it provides sufficient warning to allow for intervention before
failure shall be recorded in the design outputs.
NOTE 1
Factors that can be used to determine the frequency of future tests include the level of risk presented
by the fixing, the rate of deterioration, and potential for changes to the condition, environment, use of
the fixing and loading.
NOTE 2
CIRIA C778 [Ref 5.I]provides a sample model for assessment of risk.
NOTE 3
Examples of suitable frequencies of testing include:
1)
at every CS 450 [Ref 19.N] principal inspection for a high consequence fixing that is not
anticipated to have changes to the condition, environment, its use and loading.
2)
at alternate CS 450 [Ref 19.N]principal inspections for a medium consequence fixing that is not
anticipated to have changes to the condition, environment, its use and loading
2.26.1
Physical measures to enable future testing may include:
1)
extra fixings included specifically and solely for future testing;
2)
identification markings of extra fixings specifically and solely for future testing;
3)
fixture/connection designed to enable testing, for example, detailing an extended thread to allow
for attachment of a testing rig, or allowing for testing without removal of the fixture; and
4)
space to allow for the testing rig, which can include a spreader beam.
2.26.2
Physical measures to enable future testing may be the same physical measures provided for testing
following installation.
2.26.3
Where extra fixings are provided specifically for future testing in service, the extra fixings should be in
locations and conditions that are representative of the other fixings.
2.26.4
Where it is proposed to apply a test load to the fixture rather than directly to the fixing, then the
intended load on the fixing should be defined and related to the test load.
NOTE
For some arrangements of fixings, such as post-installed reinforcement, it can be possible only to apply
load to the fixture.
Design for end-of-life
2.27
Design assumptions about the end-of-life of the fixing system and fixing shall be documented in the
maintenance records as defined in CG 302 [Ref 1.N].
2.27.1
A viable method of removing the fixture should be identified and recorded.

2. Concept design of fixing system
2.27.2
Where potential interim replacement of fixings is included as part of a strategy to justify an extended
design working life, then the intended method of replacement should be identified and recorded.
NOTE
Potential options to allow fixings to be replaced while the fixture remains in service can include:
1)
making provision for fixings to be installed at other locations along a support framework, where
one is present;
2)
allowing for progressive replacement of fixings whilst the fixture remains in place, with
assumptions about the number of fixings that can be removed at any time during replacement.
Fire
2.28
Fire-critical fixings shall be identified, as those that:
1)
are at risk of exposure to fire; and,
2)
have a high consequence if they fail during fire.
2.28.1
Fixings in road tunnels should be classified as at risk of exposure to fire.
NOTE 1
Open structures such as retaining walls and bridges that can be cleared of people relatively quickly are
unlikely to include fixings with a high consequence of failure during a fire.
NOTE 2
A non-safety critical fixing has a low consequence of failure in normal conditions, hence is unlikely to
have a high consequence of failure during fire.
2.29
The performance of fire-critical fixings in a fire shall be consistent with the overall fire design strategy
for the structure.
NOTE
A fire design strategy can have various objectives, including some or all of:
1)
means of escape and fire fighting;
2)
continued provision of ventilation or smoke control;
3)
provide fire resistance to reduce the chance of collapse;
4)
protection of adjacent assets from fire, for example, by compartmentation.
2.30
Fire-critical fixings shall be designed in accordance with the fire design requirements derived from the
overall fire design strategy of the structure.
NOTE
Fire design requirements can include, as appropriate:
1)
design fire scenario;
2)
fire model;
3)
fire resistance class; and/or
4)
deformation limits in the fire.
2.30.1
The fire design requirements should be consistent with the purpose of the fixing and its role in the
overall fire design strategy.
NOTE
For example, if a fixing supports a ventilation duct, and the fire life safety strategy relies on ventilation
being maintained during the evacuation period, then the fixing cannot fail during that period.
2.30.2
Fire design requirements may include design or mitigation measures, including:
1)
design to provide fire resistance;
2)
use fixings with load values certified against fire test results;
3)
provide fire protection to fixings;
4)
increase robustness of fixings to fire, for example, by using a greater embedment depth; or
5)
verify performance of the complete system using fire tests.

Notes: 1) While some EADs cover seismic action, this document does not cover design of fixings for seismic actions. For characteristic resistance under
fatigue cycle loading,
2) in accordance with EAD 330250-00-0601 [Ref 27.N], the following anchors are covered:
anchors that are secured against turning of the nut under fatigue cyclic loading by suitable means. Loosening of the nut is avoided (such as by the use of lock
nuts, counter nuts of other suitable means).
anchors under fatigue cyclic shear loads only without an annular gap between the hole and the fixture and the anchor. Under fatigue cyclic tension loading a
gap is possible.
3) See EAD 330499-01-0601 2020 [Ref 3.N] for bonded anchors or EAD 330232-01-0601 [Ref 21.N]for mechanical anchors.

3. Design of post-installed fixings
NOTE
Table 3.4 provides a summary to assist in classifying the intended application. It does not cover all
categories nor fully describe all of the classifications.
3.5
Where the current version of an EAD is different to the UK designated pre-Exit version of the EAD, the
criteria for a category shall be classified to both the current version of the EAD and the UK designated
pre-Exit version of the EAD.
NOTE
For example, for a vertically downward direction of installation criteria for post-installed reinforcing bar
connections, the specifier instruction in CC 482/WSR/004 is completed with both D1 in accordance with
EAD 330087-01-0601 [Ref 29.N]and vertically downward in accordance with EAD 330087-00-0601
2018 [Ref 30.N].
3.5.1
The maximum and minimum temperatures of the concrete substrate should be derived in accordance
with BS EN 1991-1-5 [Ref 12.N] and NA to BS EN 1991-1-5 [Ref 33.N].
3.5.2
For external applications in the United Kingdom a temperature range of T2 may be assumed which can
be found in Table 3.4.
3.5.3
Where the actions to be carried by fixings have been evaluated, but the selection of a particular fixing
product is to be made by others at a later stage, then the following design information should be
provided:
1)
whether the application is safety critical or non-safety critical;
2)
design values of actions at ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS);
3)
the options required for relevant categories in Table 3.4, including cracked/uncracked concrete,
durability classification, etc.;
4)
the characteristic concrete strength to be used in the design of the fixings;
5)
any application-specific criteria relating to edge distance, centre spacings and embedment depth,
such as a maximum embedment depth, or a pre-determined embedment length;
6)
displacement limits for short and long-term loads at serviceability limit state;
7)
details of the metal component when this has been pre-determined;
8)
proof test requirements including number of tests and value of the test load.
Durability
Material for post-installed anchors for concrete highway structures
3.6
Post-installed anchors for concrete highway structures shall be stainless steel.
Durability classification for post-installed bonded and mechanical anchors except for
mechanical anchors in accordance with the UK-designated pre-Exit version of the EAD
3.7
The corrosion resistance class for stainless steel post-installed bonded and mechanical anchors
classified to EAD 330499-01-0601 2020 [Ref 3.N], EAD 330499-02-0601 [Ref 2.N], or EAD
330232-01-0601 [Ref 21.N]shall be derived in accordance with Annex A of BS EN 1993-1-4 [Ref 16.N].
NOTE
Annex A of BS EN 1993-1-4 [Ref 16.N]gives suitable stainless steel grades for each corrosion
resistance class.
Durability classification for mechanical anchors in accordance with the UK-designated pre-Exit
version of EADs
3.8
The durability classification for permanent mechanical anchors not fully encased in concrete in
accordance with EAD 330232-00-0601 2016 [Ref 22.N]shall be either (2) or (3).
NOTE
(2) and (3) are classifications defined in EAD 330232-00-0601 2016 [Ref 22.N]. Mechanical anchors
classified as (2) or (3) are stainless steel.
3.9
In aggressive environments, such as road tunnels, the durability classification for mechanical anchors
not fully encased in concrete shall be (3) in accordance with EAD 330232-00-0601 2016 [Ref 22.N].

3. Design of post-installed fixings
Durability classifications for temporary anchors
3.10
Where temporary anchors are planned to be left in place after use, then the durability classification for
the temporary anchor shall be the same as for an equivalent permanent anchor.
3.10.1
Where temporary anchors are planned to be removed after use, then lower durability classifications
may be used.
Durability classification for post-installed reinforcing bar connections
3.11
Where post-installed reinforcing bars are to be installed with portions of the bar not fully encased in
concrete, the reinforcing bar shall be stainless steel.
3.12
The corrosion resistance class for stainless steel post-installed reinforcing bars with portions of the bar
not fully encased in concrete shall be derived in accordance with Annex A of BS EN 1993-1-4 [Ref
16.N].
NOTE
Annex A of BS EN 1993-1-4 [Ref 16.N]gives suitable stainless steel grades for each corrosion
resistance class.
Dissimilar metals
3.13
Dissimilar metals shall be isolated.
NOTE
An example where dissimilar elements need to be isolated is a where a stainless steel mechanical
anchor is installed directly adjacent to carbon steel reinforcement. There are concerns that corrosion
resistance can be impaired in this situation and the existing carbon steel could already be active and be
vulnerable to bi-metallic corrosion with the stainless steel.
3.13.1
The bonding material for post-installed fixings may be used to isolate dissimilar metals.
Design method
3.14
Anchors shall be designed in accordance with the design method stated in the relevant EAD or UKAD.
NOTE 1
Post-installed anchors are designed in accordance with BS EN 1992-4 [Ref 13.N].
NOTE 2
The ETA or UKTA provides characteristic values that are used in the design method given in BS EN
1992-4 [Ref 13.N]. The design method cannot be applied without such values from an ETA or UKTA.
The ETA is the European technical product specification.
NOTE 3
In the design method for anchors, the element acts as an anchor bolt (which, in the case of bonded
anchors, is generally a threaded rod) stressed in tension, shear or combined tension and shear over a
short embedment depth.
3.15
Post-installed reinforcing bar connections shall be designed in accordance with BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref
14.N] and BS EN 1991-1-2 [Ref 11.N].
NOTE 1
The ETA for post-installed reinforcing bar connections provides characteristic values that are used to
calculate the bond and anchorage length. The design method cannot be applied without such values
from an ETA.
NOTE 2
In the design method for post-installed reinforcing bar connections, the element (a reinforcing bar or a
tension rod) is intended to behave in the same way as a cast-in reinforcing bar and acts only in tension.
This applies to most situations where existing and new concrete members are to be connected or to be
made continuous.
3.16
For post-installed reinforcing bar connections design, the shear transfer between old and new concrete
shall be designed in accordance with the rules on shear at the interface between concrete cast at
different times within BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref 14.N].
3.16.1
Where the interface between the fixture and the base material has insufficient capacity, shear lugs or
post installed anchors carrying shear should be provided in addition to the post-installed reinforcing bar
connection.

3. Design of post-installed fixings
3.17
Where a post-installed fixing is installed in a surface with a concrete repair, then the repair material
shall be ignored in the design of the fixing.
NOTE
The design methods and testing that underpins an ETA or UKTA assume that the concrete is
continuous, but for a concrete repair there is potential for a plane of weakness at the interface between
concrete surface and the repair material.
Serviceability limit state (SLS)
3.18
Post-installed reinforcing bar connections shall satisfy the SLS criteria in BS EN 1992-1-1 [Ref 14.N].
3.19
The deformation of post-installed anchors under SLS loads shall not impair structural performance,
appearance or durability.
NOTE 1
In some applications (such as temporary works fixings, strengthening a structure to accommodate
accidental loading etc.) deformation control is unlikely to be critical. However, in other cases (e.g.
anchors subject to long-term loads), careful control of deformation is often of greater significance.
NOTE 2
The characteristic displacement of an anchor under tension and shear loading is given in its ETA or
UKTA.
3.19.1
Displacement may be assumed to be proportional to applied load.
3.19.2
Where load/displacement data for a particular arrangement of embedment depth, concrete strength
and bar diameter is not available, data applicable to a smaller embedment depth, lower concrete
strength and smaller bar diameter may be used.
3.20
The design value of the displacement of an anchor shall not exceed the limiting displacements given in
Table 3.20 for short and long-term loading at SLS.
Table 3.20 Deformation limits for anchors
Maximum deformation under
short-term loading
Maximum deformation under
long-term loading
Tension
0.05 d
0.12 d
Shear
0.20 d
0.30 d
NOTE
d is the nominal diameter of the anchor in millimetres.
3.21
The deformation limits shall be met at short and long-term concrete temperatures in accordance with
the temperature classification selected from the ETA or UKTA.
NOTE
Refer to Table 3.4 for the temperature classifications.
3.21.1
Where displacement under load has significant adverse implications, more onerous project-specific
limits should be defined.
Fire resistance
3.22
Where a fixing is fire-critical and the fire design strategy includes requirements for fire resistance, then
fixings shall be designed for fire resistance based on the fire design requirements identified in Section 2.
NOTE 1
Requirements for identification of fire-critical fixings are given in Section 2.
NOTE 2
Further guidance on design of fixings for fire resistance is provided in CFA (Fixings and fire) [Ref 3.I].
3.22.1
Compliance with fire design requirements may be demonstrated by an ETA or UKTA that covers the
requirements.
3.22.2
Fire resistance may be derived for a specified design fire scenario in accordance with BS EN 1991-1-2
[Ref 11.N], BS EN 1992-4 [Ref 13.N].
NOTE
For post-installed rebar connections with mortar and bonded anchors, TR 082 [Ref 10.N]describes a
fire design method.

3. Design of post-installed fixings
3.22.3
Where the primary load effect is axial tension, the effects of fire may be mitigated by increasing the
embedment depth to compensate for the loss of bond strength close to the surface of the concrete.
NOTE
When a structure is exposed to extreme heat or fire, the temperature at relatively shallow depths within
the concrete can often be much lower than that at the concrete surface.
3.22.4
Concrete elements containing post-installed reinforcing bar connections having a high risk of exposure
to fire may be designed in accordance with BS EN 1992-1-2 [Ref 15.N].
3.22.5
The design of fire-critical post-installed reinforcement bar connections should be based on a reduced
bond strength at elevated temperatures described in BS EN 1992-1-2 [Ref 15.N].
Proof testing for fixings
3.23
A proof test axial load shall be derived for each fixing.
NOTE
Proof testing is carried out after installation of the fixing to confirm the quality of the installation as the
performance of fixings can be heavily influenced by workmanship and/or environmental conditions.
3.24
For anchors carrying tension, the proof test axial load shall be a minimum of 1.1 times the ULS design
tensile action.
3.25
For anchors carrying tension, the proof test axial load shall not exceed 1.1 times the ULS design tensile
resistance.
3.26
For anchors carrying shear, the proof test axial load shall be equal to or greater than the ULS design
tensile resistance.
3.27
For anchors carrying shear, the proof test axial load shall not exceed 1.1 times the ULS design tensile
resistance.
3.28
For post-installed reinforcing bar connections, the proof test axial load shall be a minimum of 1.1 times
the ULS design tensile action.
3.29
For post-installed reinforcing bar connections, the proof test axial load shall not exceed 1.1 times the
ULS design resistance.
3.30
The number of proof tests shall be recorded in the design outputs for each area of the works with a
different size or type of fixing, different concrete strength and different installation direction in
accordance with Table 3.32.
Table 3.30 Proof tests for fixings
Is the fixing safety critical?
Minimum number of proof tests

* Subject to a minimum of 3 fixings
NOTE
For works involving the installation of very large numbers of anchors (e.g. > 1000), the percentage of
anchors/reinforcement bars to be tested can be reduced with the agreement of the Technical Approval
Authority
3.31
The locations of the proof tests shall be recorded in the design outputs in accordance with CD 350 [Ref
32.N].
3.31.1
The locations of the proof tests should be representative of the area of the works.

Table A.1 Examples illustrating how the degree of redundancy can be related to the safety critical classification
Example situation
Non-safety critical if...
Safety critical if...
Temporary works suspended from the side of a
bridge deck to facilitate parapet replacement. The
temporary works are to be supported by fixings
anchored into the edge of the bridge deck.
…there are sufficient longitudinal members within
the temporary works to redistribute loads in the
event of failure at a group of anchors, and the
adjacent anchors have sufficient resistance to
accommodate the redistributed loads.
…each element of the temporary works is held in
place by a small number of fixings, there is no
mechanism to redistribute the load if these fixings
fail and the collapse of the temporary works could
cause injury or death.
Service duct carrying a significant utility service
suspended from a bridge deck. The duct is to be
attached to the deck using anchors supporting
brackets.
…the service duct itself has sufficient structural
resistance to span across a missing bracket, and
the adjacent brackets and anchors have sufficient
resistance to accommodate the additional
redistributed load after loss of one bracket.
…the consequences of failure of the utility are
high, for example, explosion of a gas main, or if
the loss of one bracket could lead to failure of the
utility itself, for example due to brittle duct
materials or lack of rotation capacity, or the
progressive failure of the anchors.
Environmental barrier to be fixed to the edge of a
bridge deck using anchors where the support
system is dependent on a small group of fixings.
…the consequence of failure is low, if the barrier is
likely to only fall onto a non-trafficked area on the
road side or a low height onto an inaccessible area
below.
…failure of any of the small group of fixings could
lead to failure of the support post, and the barrier
could fall onto a live carriageway.
Construction of a parapet plinth on a bridge. The
plinth is to be attached to the existing deck with
anchored reinforcing bars.
...the plinth is continuous, as the failure of one
reinforcement bar connection is unlikely to lead to
a full failure of the plinth, and ultimate failure could
also mobilise a dowel-type shear behaviour in the
connection (even though not assumed in design).
...each parapet post is attached to a standalone
plinth with a small number of local reinforcement
bar connections, since impact on a parapet post
could cause failure of the standalone plinth.
Traffic sign and associated bracket to be fixed to
the edges of a bridge deck using anchors.
...the bracket is attached using two groups of
fixings in different orientations with some acting in
shear and some acting in tension.
...the bracket is attached using a small number of
fixings in the same orientation.

Indicative strategies to eliminate safety critical fixings
Examples of indicative strategies to eliminate safety critical fixings are shown in Table A.2 and can
include redesign to remove the need for the fixing or adjustment of the design to avoid the fixing being
safety critical.
Table A.2 Indicative strategies to remove the need for safety critical fixings
Strategy
Example
Review whether the fixture is necessary given that it
introduces a safety-critical fixing.
Review whether project requirements can be satisfied using
alternative solutions.
Eliminate the fixture
Mount the fixture elsewhere; for example supported from the
ground.
Reduce the consequence of failure by changing the location
of the fixture, such as away from a traffic lane.
Make non-safety critical
Make sufficiently robust that it is inconceivable that failure of a
fixing can lead to collapse.
Cast-in fixings.
Alternatives to post-installed
anchors or reinforcing bar
connections
Alternative support, such as built-in beam.

Table A.3 Indicative risk factors and implications for concept design of fixing systems
Area
Detail
Implication of risk
Repetition
Large number of fixings to the same design and
similar installation conditions (e.g. multiple similar
installations or single large installation)
Could suffer from similar degradation in future from the same common
cause; develop strategy to provide robustness; build in ways to test
performance in the future.
Reinforced concrete
Likelihood of hitting reinforcement during drilling; specification of action
to take if reinforcement is hit.
Shotcrete
Interface between fixture connection and rough surface finish.
Prestressed concrete
Potential unsuitability of post-installed fixings due to risk of destroying
structural prestressing strand/tendons during drilling of holes.
Base material
Cladding
Potential for fixings to be hidden.
Sustained tension
Suitability of fixing type (risk of creep; note that resin fixings with an
appropriate ETA are suitable for use under sustained tension).
Actions
Cyclic loading, shock load, exposure to vibration
Potential restriction of fixings which are suitable for these actions. Some
of these actions are not covered by EADs. Supplementary justifications
and test results needed from suppliers.
Water management (such as in tunnels)
Likelihood of fixing being exposed to damp conditions.
Exposure to severe chemical pollution, such as exhaust
fumes in road tunnels, and deicing salts
Selection of fixing material type and grade (special alloys of stainless
steel required in these conditions).
Damp, corrosive, temperature extremes, fire risk
Selection of fixing material type and grade.
Unsuitability of some resins (e.g. some ETA's state fixings are only
suitable for dry internal conditions.).
Potential for loss of concrete cover during fire.
Environment
Chlorides (such as in marine environment, deicing salts)
Potential for stress corrosion of stainless steel.
