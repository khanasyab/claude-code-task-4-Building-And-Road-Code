Pavement foundation construction
Units
1.1
The unit of measurement shall be:
a)
capping ............ cubic metre.
b)
subbase ............ cubic metre.
Measurement
1.2
The measurement of capping shall be the volume of voids formed by excavation and to the outlines
stated in the Contract.
1.3
The measurement of bound capping formed by stabilisation shall be the volume of the material to be
stabilised measured to the outlines stated in the Contract irrespective of the number of layers or
thicknesses, methods or sequences of operations involved in stabilising the material to the depth
required.
1.4
The requirements associated with surcharge and earthworks outline in CC 601/MMHW [Ref 4.N] shall
apply to this method of measurement.
Note
Stabilisation means the process of stabilisation whether the material is intact and undisturbed or
deposited and compacted prior to stabilisation.
1.5
Excavation, fill, import, disposal, placement and compaction required to expose or produce the layer to
be stabilised, shall be included under the measurement of earthworks elsewhere under CC 601/MMHW
[Ref 4.N].
1.6
Excavation, placement and compaction involved in the process of stabilisation itself shall not be
measured.
1.7
The processing of unacceptable earthworks material shall be measured under CC 601/MMHW [Ref
4.N].
1.8
Other processing carried out by the Contractor shall not be measured.
1.9
The measurement of subbase shall be the volume of subbase measured to the outlines stated in the
Contract with no deductions made for openings of 1 square metre or less.
Itemisation
1.10
Separate items shall be provided for capping, subbase and concrete in accordance with clauses 2.2,
2.3, and 2.4 of GP 112 [Ref 2.N] and the following:
