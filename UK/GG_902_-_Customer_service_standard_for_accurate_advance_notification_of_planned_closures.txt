Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives National Highways-specific requirements to maintain and
maximise the accuracy of published road works information for planned (non-emergency) carriageway
and slip road full closures by 13:15 on the day of the road works, seven day forecast and seven day
rolling accuracy. The intent is to enable customers to plan ahead where they may be impacted by a
section of motorway and trunk road network that has planned main carriageway or slip road closures
for road works to take place and to provide this information by 13:15 on the day of the road works and
seven days in advance of the road works, and to measure the accuracy of forecasting.
National Highways, as part of its customer service strategy PR101/15 [Ref 2.I] and customer service
plan HE (Customer Service Plan) [Ref 3.I] is introducing customer service standards to help define
what a customer can expect and to remind management and employees of the challenge and
obligations that they face. Our customer service strategy identified that our customers want to trust
what they are being told, feel in control and have stress-free-journeys.
This document will address freight customer views raised within the Transport Focus report "Incidents
and roadworks a road user perspective" Incidents and Roadworks [Ref 4.I] which stated: "When road
works are taking place, [all customers] want accurate, timely information so they can plan their
schedules".
This document will also enable National Highways to demonstrate that it is listening and responding to
customer concerns, and is delivering road works in a way that better meets its customers' expectations.
The provision of accurate road works information to customers is reliant on the accuracy of data
maintained by National Highways relating to planned road works. This data is currently held in the
Network Occupancy Management System (NOMS).
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Seven-day forecast for planned closures reporting
E/2.15
To support the accuracy of daily reporting, a seven-day look ahead forecast report detailing closures
(main carriageway or slip road) covering the following Monday to Sunday (inclusive) period shall be
produced.
E/2.16
The seven day look ahead forecast report shall be used in a weekly planning call (usually held on
Friday) to discuss the planned closures for the next seven days.
Seven-day rolling accuracy report
E/2.17
For overnight full carriageway and slip road closures, a seven-day rolling accuracy report shall be
produced that measures the accuracy of road works information seven days (rolling) in advance.
E/2.17.1
The accuracy should be measured using the the data held in the Network Occupancy Management
System (NOMS) as per Network Occupancy Requirements GM 702 [Ref 2.N].
E/2.18
A monthly report on seven-day accuracy shall be produced.
E/2.19
A tool shall compare what did happen, to what was planned to happen seven days in advance, flagging
up five sub-categories of outputs. See table E/2.19.
Table E/2.19 5 sub-categories
Category
Result
Closures that were planned and did take place, with the works commencing within 60
minutes of planned start time
PASS
Closures that were planned and did take place, but the works commenced outside of the
60 minutes window
FAIL
Closures that were planned but did not take place
FAIL
Closures took place but were not known about 7 days in advance
FAIL
Closures that weren't anticipated, but were cancelled
FAIL
E/2.20
The tool shall then calculate the accuracy rate for performance reporting.
NOTE 1
Accuracy rate = Total volume of closures that did take place (number of PASS records) ÷ Total of all
closures (number of PASS and FAIL records), expressed as a %.
NOTE 2
The tool will be provided by the Overseeing Organisation.
E/2.21
Performance shall be measured via an increasing trajectory of improvement.
NOTE
The starting level is 41.64% and the incremental target will be advised each year to reach a target of
90%.
