Safety inspections
5.1
Safety inspections shall be undertaken in accordance with the tunnel operation and maintenance
manual and CS 450 [Ref 5.N].
5.2
A safety inspection shall be carried out at intervals determined following risk assessments, but not less
frequent than weekly.
NOTE 1
Safety inspections are frequent periodic visual inspections to identify or investigate potential defects
that can endanger the public or staff or lead to significant maintenance costs or disruption to traffic.
NOTE 2
The frequency of the safety inspections can be based on a risk assessment of the system being
considered.
NOTE 3
Safety inspections can be triggered as a result of third party notifications of defects.
NOTE 4
Such defects can include:
1) collision damage and debris;
2) water seepage;
3) ice formation;
4) spalling concrete;
5) loose, missing or defective equipment, panels, signals and controls;
6) oil spill or accumulation of dripped oil and/or debris posing a fire risk;
7) blockages in drainage and ducted ventilation systems;
8) cross passage doors not closing/opening;
9) failed M&E equipment.
NOTE 5
The scope of safety inspections depends on whether the tunnel is manned or unmanned, the
equipment associated with the tunnel, the tunnel information systems and how they are monitored.
NOTE 6
A safety inspection can be undertaken from a slow-moving vehicle, on foot, or other means such that
defects can be identified.
5.3
Where monitoring systems installed for safety critical items do not provide complete system coverage,
safety inspections of the safety critical items shall be undertaken on a daily basis.
NOTE
Complete coverage refers to the ability of the monitoring system to provide identification and
notification of issues over the extents of the safety critical item.
