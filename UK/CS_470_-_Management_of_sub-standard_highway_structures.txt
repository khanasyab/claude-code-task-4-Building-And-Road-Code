Introduction
Introduction
Background
The purpose of this document is to provide the requirements for the management of highway structures
that have either been assessed to be sub-standard according to the requirements of CS 454 [Ref 1.I] or
are deemed to be sub-standard by other methods.
Since assessments are typically based on theoretical calculations and the identification of sub-standard
structures without completed assessments are typically based on engineering judgement, such
structures do not necessarily pose an immediate and unacceptable risk to safety.
The document also provides requirements and guidance on the use of interim measures.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Immediate risk structures
Structures that are considered to represent an immediate and
unacceptable safety risk to the public.
NOTE Guidance on identifying immediate risk structures is
included in Section 3.
Load mitigation interim measures
Interim measures that reduce the effects of the loading on the
structure to an acceptable level, either by reducing the
magnitude of the loading or by altering the response of the
structure.
NOTE Examples of load mitigation interim measures include:
weight restrictions, lane restrictions, propping, use of a
temporary structure and closure.
Low risk provisionally
sub-standard structures
Provisionally sub-standard structures that are considered to be
low risk and therefore not requiring any interim measures while
the assessment is in progress.
NOTE Guidance on identifying low risk provisionally
sub-standard structures is included in Section 4.

Monitoring
For the purposes of this document monitoring is defined as the
periodic or continuous observation and recording of information
pertaining to structural behaviour, in order to detect deterioration
or distress if it occurs, to determine the extent, severity and rate
of deterioration, and to determine whether a critical limit state or
other criteria are at risk of being reached, it would also include
the consideration of the likelihood that the hazard can be
prevented in response to the detection of early warning signs,
where:
1) "Periodic" refers to observations carried out at discrete times
with intervals between them measured, in general, in weeks
or months;
2) "Continuous" refers to an observation that continues without
break in which a continuous record is made or maxima and
minima are recorded, or to one that takes place at
sufficiently small intervals to be considered continuous;
3) "Observations" are most commonly obtained by visual
inspection but they can also include measurement made
using transducers, strain gauges, probes or other
instruments;
4) "Recording" refers to writing down or mapping information
from visual observations, measurements or test data,
photography, or the automatic storage of information on
charts, printers, magnetic media or other similar;
5) "Information" can be qualitative, such as the presence of
staining or other defects, or quantitative, such as the
dimensions, locations and patterns of cracks, profile of span,
strain or deflection, or readings obtained from
non-destructive testing methods;
6) "Deterioration" refers to a decline in condition, integrity or
performance arising from any cause (including an
aggressive environment, loading, and impact), for example,
corrosion-induced spalling, load-induced cracking or
changes evidenced by strain/displacement measurement.
Monitoring-appropriate structures
Structures that are considered to be appropriate for monitoring
as an interim measure.
NOTE Guidance on identifying monitoring-appropriate structures
is included in Section 6.
Monitoring interim measures
Interim measures in the form of monitoring alone or monitoring
with other measures.
Provisionally sub-standard
structures
Structures that are deemed to be sub-standard without an
assessment (for examples scour, impact damage, deterioration)
or assessed to have sub-standard load capacity at any stage
during the assessment process, regardless of whether they are
considered appropriate to progress the assessment further.
Risk
An evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of a hazard.

Sub-standard structures
Structures found to be sub-standard in terms of meeting the
carriageway loading requirements given in CS 454 [Ref 1.I] or
by other means (as examples by scour, impact damage,
deterioration), and retaining walls that have been found to be
sub-standard either according to the principles in CS 454 [Ref
1.I] or by other means, after carrying out an appropriate
assessment.
NOTE The definition of sub-standard structures does not apply
to structures with sub-standard non-primary load carrying
elements that are not directly affected by carriageway loading
(such as sub-standard parapets, and bridge supports at risk
from collision).

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be applied for the management of sub-standard structures (see terms and
definitions), including highway bridges, retaining walls and other highway structures subject to
carriageway loading.
NOTE
A structure where only the verge under accidental wheel loading is sub-standard is generally not
classified as sub-standard but this needs to be confirmed with the Technical Approval Authority and/or
the Overseeing Organisation.
1.1.1
The principles and procedures of this document may also be useful and relevant for the following
structures which are outside the scope of this document:
1) the management of structures with sub-standard non-primary load carrying elements (including
sub-standard parapets and bridge supports at risk from collision);
2) the management of sub-standard structures that do not carry a highway;
3) the management of structures that have been assessed using standards or documents other than
CS 454 [Ref 1.I] (for example CS 458 [Ref 5.I]), and found to have insufficient capacity.
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the assessment, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of structures on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 1.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Management processes
2.
Management processes
Key processes
2.1
Provisionally sub-standard structures and sub-standard structures shall be managed by assessing the
risks to public safety associated with their continued use and imposing appropriate interim measures
when necessary.
2.2
Load mitigation interim measures shall be urgently imposed on immediate risk structures.
2.3
The risk associated with structures shall be determined based on assessments of structural resistance,
taking into account the condition and any damage that has occurred.
2.3.1
Assessment of an existing structure should be carried out in stages of increasing complexity, with the
object of efficiently determining its adequacy.
2.3.2
Where an inadequacy of an existing structure is identified in the early stages of an assessment
process, the decision whether to continue and complete the assessment should be discussed with the
Technical Approval Authority (TAA) and/or Overseeing Organisation.
Document and records management
2.4
For each provisionally sub-standard and sub-standard structure, an auditable record shall be
maintained to enable the management of the structure to be clearly documented.
2.5
The record shall include:
1) details of the decisions taken at each stage of the assessment process;
2) evidence of the approval and implementation of any interim measures;
3) documentation of the regular review of the management of the structure.
2.5.1
The record should include the following:
1) documentation of the progress of the assessment and the history of the management of the
structure. The sub-standard structure summary form given in Appendix D is to be used to
summarise the progress of the assessment process and any interim measures that have been
proposed or implemented;
2) risk assessments;
3) assessment of the feasibility, cost and appropriateness of options for interim measures. The forms in
Appendices A4 and A5 are to be used to record the feasibility of options for interim measures and to
identify immediate risk structures, low risk provisionally sub-standard structures, and
monitoring-appropriate structures;
4) record of the decision not to carry out interim measures, if appropriate, including a record of the
agreement of the TAA and/or Overseeing Organisation and/or the structure owner where relevant;
5) proposals for interim measures. The form in Appendix A6 is to be used to propose
recommendations for interim measures. The proposal is to include an assessment of the feasibility
of different interim measures (using Appendices A4 and A5) and details of proposed actions,
including the 'monitoring specification' if appropriate (using Appendix A2);
6) approval of interim measures. Documentation of the approval from all required authorities to proceed
with the recommended interim measures or details of alternative actions is to be provided, for
example by including a copy of the form in Appendix A6 signed by all relevant responsible parties;
7) record of implementation of interim measures;
8) monitoring records/reports, for structures that are being monitored;
9) records of the regular review of interim measures, including the regular review of the management
of provisionally sub-standard structures for which no interim measures are in place;
10) record of removal of interim measures;
11) record of strengthening or replacement;
12) these records are to be uploaded onto the Overseeing Organisation's management information
system.

3.
Immediate risk structures
3.1
Whenever an immediate and unacceptable risk to public safety is identified, the Overseeing
Organisation and Technical Approval Authority (TAA) shall be informed without delay.
NOTE 1
Immediate risk structures can be identified by any competent person.
NOTE 2
The identification of immediate risk structures can occur during an assessment, at the completion of an
assessment, during an inspection, following an incident such as an accidental event, or at any other
time.
3.2
In assessing immediate risk to public safety, the following factors shall be evaluated:
1) the consequence of failure;
2) nature of the structural weakness;
3) any corresponding signs of distress;
4) the possibility of hidden distress;
5) condition data;
6) the sensitivity of the structure to the applied loading;
7) the recent load history of the structure; and
8) the level of assessment completed.
NOTE
The past performance of the structure under unrestricted loading can inform the assessment of whether
an immediate risk is posed.
3.2.1
Any of the following should be taken to be indicative of an immediate risk structure:
1) any structure that is unable to sustain nominal loading (i.e. the loading according to CS 454 [Ref 1.I]
but without any partial load factors applied to live and dead loading) according to any plastic upper
bound method of assessment (such as a yield-line mechanism analysis);
a) structures with primary carriageway elements that have been assessed to have zero live load
capacity;
b) structures with carriageway elements for which the assessed capacity would be insufficient for
the required assessment live loading even when all partial safety factors (including all γfL , γm ,
and γf3 ) are set to unity;
2) any structure that, when the capacity is calculated across the full width of the structure and
compared with the load effects assuming that the loads are fully distributed across the full width of
the structure, has a corresponding live load capacity factor C (as defined in CS 454 [Ref 1.I]) that is
less than K/γfL , where K is the required Load Reduction Factor appropriate to the traffic on the
structure (as defined in CS 454 [Ref 1.I]) and γfL is the partial factor for the traffic loading;
3) any structure with significant signs of distress associated with either a non-ductile failure mode or
the formation of a failure mechanism;
4) any structure with significant damage such that the structure is considered to be at immediate risk of
collapse or landslip;
5) any scour-susceptible structure considered to be at immediate risk of collapse.
NOTE
γfL is covered in CS 454 [Ref 1.I].
Emergency interim measures
3.3
Once confirmed and agreed with the Overseeing Organisation and TAA, appropriate 'load mitigation
interim measures' (or, for elements that do not support a carriageway, appropriate interim measures as
described in Section 6) shall be implemented as a matter of urgency on any 'immediate risk structure'.
3.3.1
Where there is likely to be a delay in implementing the load mitigation interim measures, a temporary
emergency closure may be used to reduce the risks.
3.3.2
Where an emergency interim measure is required to make safe an immediate risk structure, the
agreement between the relevant parties should be recorded using the form in Appendix A8.

4.2
Where the structure is an immediate risk structure, load mitigation interim measures shall be urgently
imposed.
4.3
Load mitigation interim measures shall be imposed on provisionally sub-standard structures unless it
can be shown that the risks during the assessment process can be managed to an acceptable level
without imposing interim measures or by using monitoring interim measures.
4.3.1
Provisionally sub-standard structures may be managed without interim measures where:
1) they are not immediate risk structures;
2) it is probable that further assessment could raise the assessed capacity to an acceptable level;
3) it is possible to proceed with this assessment without delay;
4) the decision is agreed with the TAA and/or Overseeing Organisation and/or the structure owner and
recorded.
4.3.2
Low risk provisionally sub-standard structure may be managed without any interim measures during
the assessment process, provided that such a decision is agreed with the TAA and/or Overseeing
Organisation and/or the 'structure owner' where relevant, and recorded.

Where the structure is a monitoring-appropriate structure, the form of interim measures may include
monitoring, either with or without load mitigation interim measures.
Low risk provisionally sub-standard structures
4.4
The identification of low risk provisionally sub-standard structures shall be based on an assessment of
the risks associated with the continued use of the structure without imposing any interim measures.
4.4.1
Either of the following may be taken to be indicative of low risk provisionally sub-standard structures:
1) structures whose only provisionally sub-standard elements are non-carriageway elements that are
only predicted to fail under accidental loading, and where a safety barrier is in place to protect the
non-carriageway part of the structure;
2) structures in sound condition for which all of the following conditions apply:
a) the failure is likely to be gradual over time progressing from local signs of distress (such as
cracking or local failure at a connection) to more extensive failure before reaching the point
where total collapse is precipitated;
b) the consequences of failure are low; and
c) the live load capacity factor is greater than the factored Load Reduction Factor appropriate to the
traffic on the structure.

Interim measures
Load mitigation interim measures
6.1
Load mitigation interim measures shall reduce carriageway loads, or the effect of the loads, so that they
are within the capacity of the structure.
6.1.1
Load mitigation interim measures should comprise one or more of the following actions:
1) vehicle weight restrictions, calculated in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.I];
2) lane restrictions, calculated in accordance with CS 454 [Ref 1.I];
3) propping of the structure;
4) use of a temporary structure;
5) closure of the structure to all users or classes of vehicles.
6.2
Where further deterioration of the structure occurs after the application of load mitigation interim
measures, the appropriateness of the interim measures shall be reviewed.
6.3
Where the deterioration affects the effectiveness of the load mitigation interim measures, monitoring
interim measures shall be used in combination with load mitigation interim measures.
6.4
The planned maximum duration for load mitigation interim measures shall not exceed two years.
6.5
At the end of two years the application of load mitigation interim measures shall be formally reviewed in
accordance with clauses 7.1 -7.4.
Existing weight restrictions
6.6
Periodic reviews of weight restrictions shall be carried out at intervals not exceeding two years in
accordance with clauses 7.1 – 7.4 until such time that formal approval to maintain the weight limit as a
permanent measure is granted by the Highway (or Roads) Authority.
6.6.1
Where an existing weight restriction has been in place for some time, and where periodic reviews
confirm that the restriction is effective and of benefit, the structure owner may consider continuation of
the measure as a long-term arrangement, with the agreement of the Highway (or Roads) Authority.
6.6.2
The form in Appendix A9 should be used as a mechanism for accepting the weight limit as a permanent
measure.
Monitoring interim measures
6.7
Monitoring interim measures shall only be carried out on monitoring-appropriate structures.
6.8
Monitoring interim measures shall comprise either monitoring alone or monitoring with other measures
(such as propping or partial restriction of traffic loading).
Monitoring-appropriate structures
6.9
Sub-standard structures that satisfy all the criteria given in (1), (2) and (3) below, shall be considered to
be monitoring-appropriate structures, subject to Technical Approval Authority (TAA) and/or Overseeing
Organisation approval:
1) structures where no sign of significant distress is observed and hidden distress, deterioration or
weakness is unlikely to be present, or structures where distress is observed that does not appear to
be recent or significant and detrimental to the safety of the structure;
2) structures where failure is likely to be gradual over time progressing from local signs of distress
(such as cracking or local failure at a connection) to more extensive failure before reaching the point
where total collapse is precipitated (in contrast to structures whose mode of failure and collapse
under traffic load will be sudden and brittle), and it is possible to predict the mode(s) of failure under
traffic load with reasonable certainty;

6. Interim measures
3) structures and situations for which monitoring will be meaningful and effective (further guidance is
given in Appendix A1).
6.9.1
Bridges of small span (generally less than 5m) that are in sound condition and where the
consequences of failure are low may also be considered to be monitoring-appropriate structures,
subject to Technical Approval Authority (TAA) and/or Overseeing Organisation approval.
NOTE 1
Types of sub-standard structures that are likely to be monitoring-appropriate include:
a) reinforced concrete slab bridges or composite steel and concrete slab bridges with theoretical
longitudinal or transverse flexural inadequacy, especially where adequate continuity exists over
the supports;
b) structures in which the structural inadequacy (in flexure, shear or anchorage) is in an element or
connection whose failure would not precipitate sudden collapse and whose failure can be
observed by monitoring. The inadequacies can be in flexure, shear or anchorage. The critical
feature is that the structure will retain a substantial proportion of its load carrying capacity
following element/connection failure until the failure is detected and safeguarding measures are
implemented;
c) structures in which deterioration is gradually progressing and for which monitoring can be used
to measure the progression of the deterioration.
NOTE 2
Sub-standard structures that are not normally monitoring-appropriate include bridges that are
sub-standard by virtue of tension, shear, anchorage or buckling inadequacies where failure in tension,
shear, anchorage or buckling would precipitate collapse of the structure.
6.10
Managing sub-standard structures through monitoring, with or without other measures, shall be
undertaken rigorously and using appropriate professional engineering expertise and advice throughout.
NOTE 1
The management of sub-standard structures is a complex process and requires in depth knowledge of
the techniques and the potential problems.
NOTE 2
In order to design an effective monitoring and reporting system, it is necessary to understand the likely
failure mechanism of the structure.
NOTE 3
Guidance on monitoring is provided in Appendix A1.
6.11
Where monitoring interim measures are used, the monitoring regime shall be documented in a
monitoring specification.
6.12
The monitoring specification shall include:
1) a summary of the assessment findings and other background information relating to the
appropriateness of the proposed monitoring;
2) a protocol for monitoring, reporting and the escalation of decision making;
3) an emergency response and communication plan, where appropriate and agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation, and where sudden deterioration could lead to a structure being classified
as an 'immediate risk structure';
4) a detailed plan of the monitoring regime, including the definition of all parameters to be monitored,
directly related to the predicted mode(s) of failure, and the degree of accuracy required;
5) the frequency of monitoring;
6) definition of trigger levels;
7) details of any actions to be taken if trigger levels are exceeded;
8) requirements for the recording and reporting of monitoring activities;
9) a plan for the review of the monitoring regime.
6.12.1
The format in Appendix A2 should be used for the monitoring specification.
NOTE
Monitoring by itself does not prevent damage from occurring. The longer monitoring is continued, the
greater is the possibility of damage, particularly for bridges on heavily trafficked routes.

6.17
An emergency response and communication plan shall be maintained for sub-standard structures
subject to monitoring interim measures.
6.17.1
The emergency response and communication plan should include:
1) definition of roles and responsibilities;
2) contact details for all parties including out of hours and/or deputies;
3) protocol for monitoring, reporting, trigger level and escalation of decision making;
4) list of senior management for escalation and stakeholders and suppliers to be informed.
6.18
The emergency response and communication plan shall be uploaded onto the Overseeing
Organisation's management information system.
Interim measures for non-carriageway parts of structures
6.19
A planned maximum duration for interim measures for non-carriageway parts of structures shall be
specified.
NOTE 1
The planned maximum duration for interim measures can apply to both deck cantilevers as well as
non-carriageway parts of beam and slab decks.
NOTE 2
For non- carriageway parts of structures, such as cantilevers, it can be more suitable to install an
appropriate vehicle restraint, which could be considered as a long-term solution (See CS 454 [Ref 1.I]).
6.20
At the end of the planned duration for interim measures for non-carriageway parts specified period, the
continued application of interim measures shall be formally reviewed.

Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
A1
General
This appendix gives advice on the application of monitoring. It describes different classes of monitoring
for structures found to be monitoring-appropriate in the assessment process and provides guidance on
their use.
The purpose of monitoring should be defined; for examples: detecting (and quantifying) damage and
deterioration, validating the effect of remedial measures.
The actions to be taken based on the monitoring should be defined; for examples: trigger levels and
the actions to be taken, the use of data in supporting analysis.
There are many techniques and instruments available for monitoring with differing capabilities and
limitations. As new monitoring techniques and instruments become available, careful appraisal of their
benefits/disbenefits should be undertaken prior to their use.
The class of monitoring should be selected to suit the circumstances of the particular structure and its
assessed inadequacy in order to provide the level of additional assurance required.
The class and type of monitoring should be appropriate for the likely failure mechanism of the structure
(or part of structure to be monitored).
At the lowest level monitoring may be limited to visual inspection and recording information.
All highway structures are, as a minimum, subjected to basic visual inspections ('general inspections')
every two years and more detailed inspections ('principal inspections') normally every six years at
intervals described in CS 450 [Ref 3.I] but see also 'Well-Managed Highway Infrastructure – A Code of
Practice' ( WmHI CoP [Ref 6.I]).
Once in operation, any unexpected or potentially critical change in the condition of the structure or its
loading revealed by the monitoring should be examined urgently and reported to the structure owner to
determine the next course of action.
The extent of monitoring will depend on the type of structure, its condition, current circumstances, load
mitigation interim measures proposed, the assessed structural inadequacies and likely failure
mechanism.
The monitoring should be continued until the structure has been strengthened or replaced, or load
mitigation interim measures have been implemented.
In some cases it may be appropriate to monitor in conjunction with load mitigation interim measures.
Where weight restrictions on a bridge or structure have been implemented, consideration should be
given to ensuring adherence, the likely extent of compliance, level of policing and need for systematic
monitoring.
Types of inadequacy that may be inherent in a sub-standard structure include the following:
1) the assessment calculations indicate that the load carrying capacity is inadequate because the
original design loading was lower than that now required, and/or other principles and criteria used in
the original design were less onerous than those now adopted for assessment;
2) there was an error in design or construction that has resulted in a specific potential weakness,
without which the carrying capacity would be adequate;
3) there has been deterioration or damage since construction sufficient to reduce the assessed
capacity, without which the structure would have been adequate. Deterioration may be continuing,
thereby reducing the capacity still further;
4) ad hoc/rule of thumb construction was used. The structure was not formally designed for any traffic
loading.
Two or more of these types of inadequacy may be present in combination. For structures falling within
scope of 1 or 3, the primary objective will normally be to monitor the deficient part of the structure or the

Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
development of deterioration. For structures falling within the scope of 1, the assessment calculations
provide the basis for identifying the critical areas for monitoring.
Any of the inadequacies described may be present in a structure without visible signs of structural
distress. Cracking with associated corrosion may be present where it is hidden from visual inspection;
for examples in the webs of contiguously placed beams, under the surfacing in hogging regions, at half
joints or hinges. Such possibilities together with information on other forms of deterioration should be
taken into account when planning a monitoring scheme.
It is important to consider the reasons for the absence of predicted live-load distress for all
sub-standard structures, particularly for those within the scope of 1.
The possibilities of deterioration in performance should also be considered and how this can be
identified by monitoring. In some circumstances evidence of deterioration may be found in an area
other than the one assessed as inadequate. For example, an inadequacy in mid-span flexure, relieved
in practice by moment restraint at supports, may first be indicated by the onset of movement at the
supports rather than distress at mid-span.
An essential starting point in considering whether to implement a monitoring regime for a structure is the
criteria for monitoring-appropriate structures given in section 6. Other key issues to be considered are:
1) the structure's specific purpose;
2) what events, distress or deterioration may possibly occur;
3) the ability to observe these events and the consequences should they not be detected;
4) the accuracy and relevance of the observations; and
5) the costs and disruption incurred in obtaining data.
The presence of structural distress is an important criteria requiring careful consideration.
Where distress in a structure appears to be recent, significant or to have resulted from live load effects,
monitoring in service may not be appropriate without other measures being implemented. Other types
of distress, particularly distress of a minor nature, are unlikely to invalidate monitoring provided their
significance and effects can be accounted for.
Potential modes of collapse, in particular progression from local failure and ductility, will be strongly
influenced by the structural form, especially the extent of redundancy and the presence of alternative
load paths. When relying on alternative load paths as part of the justification for the implementation of a
monitoring regime, there should be no weak links in the redundant path.
When attempting to foresee possible modes of failure it should be borne in mind that the C factor (see
CS 454 [Ref 1.I]) for each inadequacy may not give a definitive indication of the collapse mode, or the
load effect that will first show signs of distress. Alternatives should be reviewed to ensure that a sudden
mode of failure has not been overlooked.
When the above considerations lead to doubt about the effectiveness of a monitoring regime,
monitoring should not normally be relied upon alone without the implementation of load mitigation
interim measures. Where another interim measure is in place, a monitoring regime may be devised to
provide assurance that the measure is functioning as required. Thus, for example, if temporary
propping is installed, monitoring inspections may be used to check continued integrity of the temporary
props and to check for signs of movement, distress or degradation.
A1.1
Classes of monitoring
A principal objective of all classes of monitoring is the detection of deterioration in structural behaviour
or condition, should it occur. It may also be used to confirm structural behaviour under live load. The
monitoring regime for a structure should be defined in detail in each specific case. A monitoring
specification is required as described in section 6 and Appendix A2. The three monitoring classes
described below serve as a starting point for more detailed specification.

Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
Class 1 is the lowest class of monitoring and Class 3 the highest. Class 2 includes all the Class 1
provisions and Class 3 all the Class 1 and 2 provisions.
For all classes of monitoring, if deterioration occurs, the cause, severity and extent should be identified.
A1.1.1
Class 1 – Basic monitoring
Class 1 monitoring consists of visual observations and recording.
The use of photography is essential. Measurements are not normally undertaken, but the condition of
the critical parts of the structure should be noted and compared with previous records.
Inspection at touching distance is normally required, although for some structures the use of binoculars
may be appropriate, with the agreement of the Technical Approval Authority (TAA) and/or Overseeing
Organisation. Simple operations, such as hammer tapping to check for delamination or loose
members, may be included. Recording of traffic flows and composition may also be required.
Observations for Class 1 monitoring should be at intervals of weeks or months and should therefore be
more frequent than for a structure that meets the requirements of CS 454 [Ref 1.I].
A1.1.2
Class 2 – Detailed monitoring
Class 2 monitoring includes the visual observations and photographic provisions of Class 1,
supplemented as appropriate by one or more of the following:
1) recording of quantitative information which may include: the extent and nature of deterioration; (as
examples, the locations and dimensions of areas affected); the length, width, depths and spacing of
cracks; a level survey repeated periodically; and non-destructive testing. Reference may be made to
DMRB document CS 464 [Ref 4.I] and 'Technical Guide 2: Guide to testing and monitoring the
durability of concrete structures' CS TG2 [Ref 2.I];
2) measurement of changes in parameters such as displacement or strain at typical or critical positions
in cases including those where visual inspection alone is not sufficient to confirm that there is no
change in the structural action, structure condition, or response to traffic loading. Parameters to be
monitored may include measurements to detect changes in permanent or transient effects, so
monitoring may need to be continuous, instantaneous or maximum/minimum. (It is emphasised that
the use of the word typical here refers to a situation in which, for instance, one typical beam might
be monitored from a multi-beam span, or one typical span monitored from a multi-span deck, to act
as a check on the progression of any distress. If undue distress is observed the situation should be
reviewed, additional monitoring may be necessary or 'load mitigation interim measures' may be
required);
3) measurement of parameters such as strain or displacement at particular defects, or in areas
associated with damage or deterioration, in a bridge otherwise not sub-standard;
4) extended traffic loading survey, as appropriate.
The frequency of observations for Class 2 monitoring can differ, depending on the bridge, from periodic
visits at intervals of several months, to more frequent visits or to continuous monitoring.
Determination of the frequency should take into consideration the most likely modes of failure, its
progression and consequences and the ability of the monitoring system to detect warning of
progression.
A1.1.3
Class 3 – Extensive monitoring
Class 3 monitoring is the highest level of monitoring. It may require frequent or continuous monitoring
in one or more of the Class 2 categories where the onset of change is predicted to progress
significantly towards failure in a short time.
Measurements carried out in typical or critical positions, as appropriate to Class 2 monitoring, may be
insufficient and a more extensive coverage of potentially critical points is likely to be required.
Class 3 monitoring will often require continuous monitoring using data loggers and, where appropriate,
remote monitoring techniques.

Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
Automatic alarm systems may be installed, to give warning when a parameter goes outside a
pre-determined limit.
A1.2
Selection of appropriate monitoring class
The following discussion, which is not exhaustive, indicates some of the important factors that may
need to be considered in defining the monitoring regime for a particular sub-standard structure. Some
specific guidance is given for flexural and shear inadequacies, and for masonry arch structures. In all
cases, if deterioration occurs, the level of monitoring should be reviewed.
A visual inspection regime (Class 1) will be sufficient in many cases to give an adequate assurance of
safety. Structures having a sound structural form with no significant defects or signs of distress but
which have been assessed to be sub-standard are typical subjects for this type of monitoring. The
predicted mode of failure of the structure and its speed of progression over time are important
considerations. Where the mode of failure is such that the structure will gradually show visual signs of
increasing distress over a period of (at least) several weeks as traffic continues to use the bridge, then
a visual inspection regime may be appropriate.
When an evaluation of the structure indicates that additional assurance is required, then measurement
using a small number of instruments placed at typical positions may be justified in accordance with a
Class 2 monitoring regime.
This might be appropriate when, for example, there would be an advantage in detecting any increase in
maximum strain under live load or in the dead load condition. A Class 2 regime might also be
appropriate when it is desired to increase the intervals between visual inspections. The use of
instrumentation may also be needed where access for regular visual inspection of critical elements is
not practical.
The higher classes of monitoring should be considered when the predicted mode of failure and its
speed of progression towards bridge collapse might be quite rapid once visual signs are present.
When visual signs are likely to occur only when progression towards collapse is well advanced,
monitoring should allow detection as soon as possible. Depending on the likely timescales involved, a
high frequency of visual inspection, or intermittent or continuous monitoring (Class 2 or Class 3), using
instrumentation in addition to visual inspection should be considered; for example, where the structure
has a defect or advanced degradation in a critical element, or the critical element is sound but
under-strength, and failure under high traffic load would lead to sudden collapse. In these
circumstances the adoption of monitoring alone should be considered with particular caution, the need
being to ensure the monitoring system will provide adequate forewarning of collapse.
Class 3 monitoring will normally be required on a structure where it is necessary to allow a higher level
of loading than that given in the assessment standards to continue, although the inadequacies of the
structure are substantial and its strengthening or replacement is given a high priority. It may have a
combination of defects. A decision to increase the level of monitoring from Class 2 to Class 3 may be
influenced by the perceived consequences of failure.
A1.3
Sub-standard bridges with flexural inadequacies
Examples of flexural inadequacy where monitoring requirements may usually be met are:
1) bridges where the theoretical structural inadequacy is in an element or connection, or type of load
effect, where its failure can be observed by monitoring if it should fail, and where the failure will not
cause sudden collapse of the bridge span;
2) bridges where there is a theoretical flexural inadequacy that may lead, under repeated or
increasingly heavy load, to progressively increasing permanent or transient deflection or strain.
An inadequacy in transverse flexure in a reinforced concrete slab bridge places the bridge in the first of
these two categories; that is, longitudinal cracking might occur initially, but collapse would not be
expected to follow until longitudinal failure took place with accompanying transverse cracking. For an
inadequacy in longitudinal flexure at mid-span, the bridge might fall into the second category.

======================================================================
CS 470 Revision 0
Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
It should not be assumed automatically that any flexural inadequacy is suitable for Class 1 monitoring.
Moreover, a combination of circumstances might prevent such a bridge being classified as
monitoring-appropriate. For concrete structures, difficulties arise where the tension fibre cannot be
observed, such as the top surface of a built-in slab, portal or box culvert.
This could lead to a requirement for a higher level of monitoring, say Class 2, with, for example, strain
gauges attached in typical positions to detect any reduction in flexural stiffness that could indicate
cracking on the concealed surface. Alternatively instrumentation could be placed on the concealed
surface. However, for concrete structures, provided there is sufficient ductility, and cracking would be
expected to occur on the visible face before failure, a Class 1 monitoring regime would be sufficient.
For some concrete structures, there may be the potential for a more sudden type of flexural failure with
less displacement and cracking, for example, older prestressed structures that contain little reinforcing
steel or structures with inadequate laps or anchorages.
The margin between the cracking moment and the ultimate moment should also be considered since it
indicates the potential for warning signs to be observed. In rare cases the ultimate moment could be
less than the cracking moment.
Similar issues in steel or composite bridges require a distinction to be made between tension or
compression failure in flexure, whether or not the section is compact or if buckling is likely, or whether
the resistance would change suddenly as a result of the failure at an interface. Imperfections are likely
to have an effect on the appraisal, as is the practicality of measuring out-of-plane displacements.
Wide bridges that carry several lanes are statistically less likely to fail suddenly and catastrophically in
flexure under traffic loading than a single-lane bridge for which one vehicle could cause a loading event
of significantly greater magnitude than the bridge had previously experienced. For wide bridges the
maximum loading is more likely to build up gradually over time if local traffic conditions change and
failure generally has to occur over the full width if collapse is to take place.
Narrow, statically determinate bridges with a global flexural inadequacy under single vehicle or axle
loading will not normally satisfy the requirement for gradual progression of distress which can be
monitored by visual inspection alone at intervals of several weeks.
For such structures a higher level of monitoring may be appropriate including frequent visual inspection
or instrumentation to detect progression of distress.
Where spans are continuous and thus redundancies are present, a collapse mechanism may begin to
form long before collapse becomes imminent.
Inadequacies in torsion are more significant when the torsional resistance is required for equilibrium
purposes.
A1.4
Sub-standard bridges with shear inadequacies
Bridges with shear inadequacies are not generally suitable for monitoring. Monitoring may, however, be
considered where the bridge is wide.
For concrete bridges it should be considered only where either:
1) visible flexural cracking would precede shear distress and act as an early warning; or
2) inclined cracks would occur on surfaces that can be observed.
For monitoring to be appropriate, there has to be an adequate margin between first cracking and
maximum shear capacity, which may be determined by consideration of the degree of theoretical
inadequacy, a comparison between the code provision and the test results from which it is derived, and
other factors such as redundancy, width of structure, susceptibility to loading by a single vehicle and
the dead load/live load ratio.
Narrow concrete bridges with shear inadequacies are not suitable for monitoring when C for shear is
less than 0.55K, and not when it is less than 0.66K (see CS 454 [Ref 1.I]) unless inclined cracks would
be visible and sufficient shear reinforcement is present to provide a significant capacity margin above
the inclined cracking load.

Appendix A. Monitoring of sub-standard structures
Bridges with sub-standard shear details, such as inadequate anchorage, are not generally suitable for
monitoring.
A1.5
Sub-standard masonry arch bridges
Masonry arch bridges are suitable for monitoring only when it is considered that there is a significant
margin of strength above the assessed capacity, and that adequate signs of distress will arise under
high vehicle load sufficient to forewarn of vulnerability to collapse. The following factors should be
considered in establishing whether monitoring is appropriate and if it is, the necessary level of
monitoring:
1) the presence and effect of strengthening features that have not been accounted for in the
assessment such as internal walls, robust spandrel/wing walls;
2) the load history of the structure, if known, particularly if the structure has previously carried heavy
loads;
3) the type of arch ring and its influence on observable deterioration. For examples, for dressed stone
masonry would defects be visible?; for a multi-ring bridge is hidden ring separation present?; for
rubble masonry is deterioration obscured?;
4) the arch ring shape and its potential for sudden collapse, considering, for examples, whether it is
circular or elliptical, its span-to-rise ratio, and the effect of haunching;
5) the condition of the foundations and the potential for movement to produce sudden failure. Could a
saddle have increased the eccentricity of thrust there may be an additional risk when defects have
been subjected to cosmetic repairs that conceal faults, for example the detachment of a spandrel
wall or arch ring separation;
6) the type and nature of existing defects, which may indicate the potential for sudden collapse;
7) the modes of deterioration, considering how the progression of such deterioration may be effectively
monitored.

Monitoring specification
The monitoring regime for each sub-standard structure should be specified in a clear, unambiguous
monitoring specification. The specification should include the following (unless the monitoring is
intended merely to check that load mitigation interim measures are continuing to function satisfactorily):
A2.1
Background
This section should include a summary of the relevant information included in the interim measures
feasibility assessment (see Appendix A4 and A5). In particular, it should include a summary of the
following:
1) assessment findings. The basis of the assessment inadequacy, stated clearly and concisely.
Generic reasons such as 'flexure' or 'shear' are not sufficient: the location, nature, degree and
underlying reasons should be stated, and the live load capacity factor C and the required Load
Reduction Factor K for the existing traffic and road surface category given (see CS 454 [Ref 1.I]).
When there are several inadequacies, each should be described and an overview given. The level
of assessment undertaken should also be stated;
2) deterioration of structure. A review of existing information on the causes, extent and severity of any
deterioration together with the expected progression of the deterioration;
3) service performance. An appraisal of the reasons for the observed satisfactory service performance:
for example, low load levels, conservative structural model; conservative resistance model,
resistance enhancement;
4) anticipated failure mode(s). The anticipated mode(s) of failure together with an indication of the
likelihood and consequences of such failure.

E/1.
Prioritisation for strengthening or replacement
E/1.1
The strengthening or replacement of sub-standard structures shall be prioritised, whilst ensuring public
safety and preventing loss of use of the structures by maintaining appropriate interim measures.
E/1.1.1
The strengthening or replacement of a sub-standard structure may take several years.
E/1.1.2
Value management techniques may be useful for the prioritisation of strengthening works.
NOTE
Reference can be made to 'Well-managed highway infrastructure - A Code of Practice' WmHI CoP [Ref
1.I].
E/1.2
Prioritisation of strengthening work to sub-standard structures shall take into account:
1) the relative risks of the structures to public safety, taking account of the effectiveness of the interim
measures (including monitoring only), reserves of strength, and the causes, severity, extent and rate
of deterioration and its consequences;
2) the specified maximum intended duration for monitoring 'interim measures';
3) the traffic delay costs that are caused by the implementation of interim measures, and which will be
eliminated when the strengthening or replacement is complete;
4) other social, environmental and economic consequences caused by interim measures to business
and community, in addition to those related to the traffic delay costs and which will be eliminated
when the strengthening is complete;
5) the risks and other issues associated with alternative routes (including winter conditions and other
route-related considerations);
6) the whole-life cost-effectiveness of the strengthening, taking into account the ratio of costs and
benefits, and the residual life of the structure;
7) other benefits which will result from the work such as improvements to sight lines and parapets,
general repairs and preventative maintenance; and
8) strategic development of the highway network.
