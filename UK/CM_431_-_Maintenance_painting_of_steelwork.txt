2.
General requirements for developing a maintenance painting
scheme
2.1
The need for maintenance painting of a structure shall be established by undertaking an existing
condition survey of steelwork corrosion protection in accordance with Section 3 of this document.
NOTE
The need for an existing condition survey can be identified through inspections undertaken in
accordance with CS 450 [Ref 2.N].
2.1.1
Where the condition of a protective system has been assessed in the existing condition survey as being
Category III or Category IV, maintenance painting should be carried out at the earliest opportunity.
2.1.2
The maintenance painting of a structure should be undertaken before the condition of the protective
system has deteriorated to the extent that structural integrity is compromised as a result of corrosion of
the steel substrate.
NOTE 1
Delaying maintenance painting work can lead to increased costs for restoring the protective system to a
satisfactory standard and can result in corrosion of the steel substrate.
NOTE 2
Undertaking localised repairs can be beneficial in extending the service life of the protective system
whilst an overall maintenance painting scheme is put in place. Undertaking localised repairs can also
extend the period to overall maintenance painting being required where the condition of a protective
system has been assessed in the existing condition survey as being one of categories 0, I, or II, as
described in Appendix A, but localised areas exhibit severe coating defects.
NOTE 3
For structures with a remaining service life of less than 20 years, undertaking localised repairs can be
beneficial in extending the service life of the protective system where the remaining service life of a
protective system is less than the expected remaining service life of the structure.
2.2
Where the need for maintenance painting has been established, following an existing condition survey,
a preliminary design for maintenance painting of steelwork design shall be prepared in accordance with
Section 4 of this document.
2.3
Feasibility trials shall be undertaken in accordance with Section 5 of this document, to verify the
methods and materials for the preliminary maintenance painting of steelwork design prior to issue.
2.4
All structural maintenance work that affects the durability of a protective system, including the
remedying of deck leaks and the repair of leaking joints, shall be carried out before maintenance
painting.
Durability of maintenance paint systems
2.5
A protective system shall have an anticipated life to major maintenance of 20 years, in accordance with
Appendix C, unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE 1
A protective system with an anticipated life to major maintenance of less than 20 years can be
appropriate where:
1)
a structure has a remaining life of less than 20 years, as agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation;
2)
the Overseeing Organisation decides to prioritise cost; or
3)
the required paint items are unavailable.
NOTE 2
The remaining life of the structure and its future use can be clarified with the structure owner.
NOTE 3
The remaining life of a structure can be limited, for example, as a result of structural defects or by the
future need for a structure.
2.6
For structures where a protective system with a life to major maintenance of less than 20 years is used,
the anticipated service life shall be recorded in the Overseeing Organisation's structures asset
management database.
2.6.1
For protective systems where an anticipated life to major maintenance of less than 20 years is
permissible, the anticipated life to major maintenance may be in accordance with Appendix C.

Environment
2.7
The environment of the structure for maintenance painting shall be defined as Inland or Marine.
2.8
The definition Marine shall apply to structures in locations where there is a risk of coming into contact
with sea salt spray or road salt spray.
2.8.1
Structures within 2000 meters of the coast should be defined as marine.
2.8.2
Structures over salted roads at or below the minimum standard headroom or located within 10.0 metres
horizontally of a salted carriageway should be defined as marine.
2.9
The definition Inland shall apply to structures where the conditions for Marine do not apply.
Accessibility
2.10
The accessibility of the structure for maintenance painting shall be defined as Difficult Access or Ready
Access.
2.10.1
The definition Difficult Access should apply to painting activities, which includes any associated
inspections and trials, where:
1)
any form of traffic management and/or temporary access/works is required; or
2)
painting activities are subject to any kind of restriction due to road or rail traffic, including being
restricted to being undertaken one section at a time, undertaken at night or outside the normal
painting season of May to September, or halted completely at certain periods due to road or rail
traffic volume.
NOTE
Difficult Access is likely to apply to any structure on or adjacent to a carriageway or railway, including
minor structures such as lighting columns.
2.11
The definition Ready Access shall apply to structures where the conditions for Difficult Access do not
apply.
Maintenance painting of weathering steel
2.12
The processes described in this document for preparing a maintenance painting design, including
undertaking feasibility trials, shall apply in the case of the maintenance of weathering steel in a
structure when it is to be painted for the first time.
2.12.1
The painting of weathering steel in a structure may be adopted to address poor performance of the
material in service.
Requirements for provision of paint samples
2.13
The following information about the Overseeing Organisation's testing authority shall be provided:
1)
name;
2)
postal address; and
3)
email address.
NOTE 1
The contact details of the Overseeing Organisation's testing authority are available from the
Overseeing Organisation's paint specialist.
NOTE 2
The contact details of the Overseeing Organisation's testing authority are not required where other
arrangements have been agreed with the Overseeing Organisation's testing authority for the testing
and reporting 'A' and 'B' samples.

3.12
The existing condition survey shall determine the presence of any toxic element in the existing
protective system, including lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, aluminium, and zinc.
NOTE
Various toxic elements can be released from the coating depending on method of preparation. As the
final method of preparation is not known at the time of the existing condition survey, it is not be possible
to identify all toxic elements, and the contractor can carry out additional tests at time of work to
determine toxicity of the existing protective system.
3.13
The existing condition survey shall determine the resin type of the existing paint coats by carrying out
resin identity testing.
3.14
The existing condition survey shall determine the types and levels of contaminants present on the
surface of the existing protective systems, including:

5. Feasibility trials
5.
Feasibility trials
5.1
Feasibility trials of the proposed method(s) of surface preparation and maintenance paint system(s)
described in the preliminary maintenance painting design shall be carried out and reported except in
the following cases:
1)
where the surface preparation has been identified as blast cleaning to clean steel or Sa2 to BS
EN ISO 8501-1 [Ref 2.I], over the whole surface area of the structure; or
2)
for small section steelwork having ready access (such as parapets and lighting columns remote
from a carriageway), where there are no concerns over the compatibility of the proposed
maintenance paint system and any sound existing protective systems that are to be overcoated.
NOTE 1
Except in cases where the whole of the existing protective system is to be removed, it is not always
possible to quantify accurately the full extent or intensity of the surface preparation required, or to
predict the compatibility of new paints when applied over existing paints, without carrying out feasibility
trials.
NOTE 2
The feasibility trials are intended to verify the suitability of the maintenance painting design.
NOTE 3
Changes to the maintenance painting design shown to be necessary during the feasibility trials can
prevent delays and additional costs during the maintenance painting works due to inappropriate design
requirements.
5.2
The feasibility trials shall be undertaken by an organisation that is registered to NHSS 19A [Ref 1.I] by a
UKAS-accredited certification body or equivalent.
5.3
Except in the case of weathering steel being painted for the first time, the feasibility trials shall comprise
a minimum of two separate representative areas of the structure such that each proposed method of
surface preparation and at least two different paint manufacturer's paint systems are subject to a trial.
NOTE
Two trial areas allow one method of surface preparation and two paint manufacturer's paint systems to
be trialled.
5.3.1
In the case of weathering steel being painted for the first time, the feasibility trials may comprise one
representative area to trial the proposed method(s) of surface preparation only.
5.4
The surface preparation and paint application for feasibility trials shall be in accordance with CC 487
[Ref 4.N].
NOTE
The feasibility trials need to be consistent with the methods and materials that can be used in the
maintenance painting scheme.
5.5
At each stage in the treatment of the trial areas, that is surface preparation, the application of each
paint coat, and the curing of each paint coat, the treated areas shall be inspected in accordance with
CC 487 [Ref 4.N], by an inspector complying with CC 487 [Ref 4.N].
5.5.1
At each stage, the trial should not proceed until compliance with the maintenance painting design has
been achieved.
5.5.2
Where the inspection cannot confirm compliance with the maintenance painting design, the reasons for
any defects and remedial action required to achieve compliance should be identified.
5.6
Following application and curing of the complete paint system, the inspection shall include testing the
adhesion of the applied maintenance paint system to the substrate.
NOTE
Satisfactory adhesion is >5.2 MPa, with pull-off adhesion tested in accordance with ASTM D4541 [Ref
3.I].
Reporting of the feasibility trials
5.7
The feasibility trials shall be recorded in a report, including:

Appendix A. Categories of failure of protective systems
Appendix A. Categories of failure of protective systems
The category of failure of protective systems described in Table A.1 allows for an assessment of the
condition of a protective system to be made and the need for maintenance painting to be identified.
The categories of failure of protective systems described in Table A.1 may be used in reporting routine
structure inspections, to describe the extent of failure of protective systems and to identify whether the
need for maintenance painting should be investigated further through undertaking a pre-specification
survey.
The purpose of allocating one of the five categories of failure described in Table A.1 as part of the
pre-specification survey is to confirm the need for and extent of maintenance painting.
The categorisation also allows the prioritisation of the need for maintenance painting where a number of
structures are exhibiting coating defects. It also assists in standardising the pre-contract procedure for
maintenance painting works and helps in identifying the extent and nature of the maintenance painting
that is required. Other criteria that can influence the latter are accessibility, environment, expected life
of the structure and cost, including road user delay costs and rail access or train delay costs.

Description
Maintenance requirement
0
Minor weathering of finish coat apparent but no evidence of denatured paintwork or
substrate corrosion.
None
I
Small localised areas of denatured finish coat and intermediate coats visible. Paintwork
generally sound elsewhere with no evidence of denatured primer, deterioration of metal
coating if present or substrate corrosion. Less than 1.0% of the total area exhibits
paintwork defects.
Possibly localised
II
Normal weathering of finish coat e.g. chalking, loss of gloss, surface affected by deposits.
Localised areas of denatured paintwork affecting finish and intermediate coats and small
localised areas of denatured primer possibly with some deterioration of metal coating if
present or substrate corrosion. Small areas of white corrosion products may be apparent
due to the deterioration of a metal coating if present. Less than 1.0% of total area exhibits
denatured primer, deterioration of metal coating if present or substrate corrosion, or greater
than 1.0% but less than 3.0% of the total area exhibits paintwork defects or poor adhesion1.
Possibly localised
III
Areas of denatured paintwork affecting finish, intermediate and primer coats with evidence
of deterioration of metal coating if present or substrate corrosion. Areas of white corrosion
products may be apparent due to the deterioration of a metal coating if present. Less than
3.0% of the total area exhibits denatured primer, deterioration of metal coating if present or
substrate corrosion, or greater than 3.0% but less than 10% of the total area exhibits
paintwork defects or poor adhesion1.
Minor maintenance
IV
General failure of the protective system with numerous areas of denatured paintwork and
areas of deterioration of metal coating if present or substrate corrosion. Substrate
corrosion varying from surface rusting to heavy rusting. Areas of white corrosion products
may be apparent due to the deterioration of a metal coating if present. Greater than 3.0%
of the total area exhibits denatured primer, deterioration of metal coating if present or
substrate corrosion, or greater than 10.0% of the total area exhibits paintwork defects or
poor adhesion1.

Appendix A. Categories of failure of protective systems
Note 1: 5.2 MPa pull-off adhesion is the minimum adhesion value that is considered satisfactory for
new protective systems, including where an existing coating is to be overcoated as a result of
maintenance painting. However, a pull-off adhesion value of less than 5.2 MPa may be sufficient for the
continued satisfactory performance of an existing protective system to achieve its intended service life
without maintenance. In undertaking a pre-specification survey of an existing coating, the inspector
should consider the measured pull-off adhesion values, the overall condition of the protective system
and its expected remaining service life in making a judgement on whether the coating exhibits poor
adhesion and is in need of maintenance.

Paint system
Notes on application
Anticipated durability to major maintenance
HM I: Maintenance 4 Coat System
The HM I maintenance paint system:
1) Is applicable as the default maintenance painting
system for minor or major maintenance of external
surfaces to achieve the best durability, maximising the
period to the next maintenance painting intervention.
2) Should be adopted for the maintenance of structures
originally protected with a paint system incorporating a
thermal metal spray coating (aluminium or zinc) which
has become exposed due to failure of the paint system
over the thermal metal spray coating, and where total
removal of the protective coating system is not cost
effective.
3) Should be adopted for the painting of structures where
the complete removal of the original protective system
is necessary, and the remaining life of the structure is
greater than 15 years.
4) Is suitable for the maintenance of internal surfaces of
enclosed steel sections to maximise the period to the
next maintenance painting intervention of internal
surfaces (durability likely to be >20 years for internal
surfaces).
5) Is not suitable for use over chlorinated rubber, acrylated
rubber, bituminous or single pack coatings.
20 years.

Table C.1 Guidance on the application of the paint systems described in Appendix B (continued)
HM II: Maintenance 3 Coat System
(external or internal surfaces)
The HM II
maintenance paint system:
1) Is suitable for minor or major maintenance of external
surfaces where the reduced durability provides a
cost-effective solution over the remaining life of the
structure compared to the use of the HM I system.
2) Should be adopted for the painting of structures where
the complete removal of the original protective system
is necessary, and the remaining life of the structure is
less than 15 years.
3) Is suitable for the maintenance of internal surfaces of
enclosed steel sections (durability likely to be >15 years
for internal surfaces).
4) May be suitable for use over chlorinated rubber or
acrylated rubber coatings.
5) Is not suitable over bituminous or single pack coatings.
6) Is not suitable for maintenance of structures originally
protected with a paint system incorporating a thermal
metal spray coating (aluminium or zinc) which has
become exposed due to failure of the paint system over
the thermal metal spray coating.
15 years.
HM III: Maintenance 2 Coat Patch
System
The HM III
maintenance paint system:
1) Is suitable for localised maintenance of both external
and internal surfaces with small areas of denatured
finish coat or finish and intermediate coats (Category I
failure Table A.1), to extend the life of the paint system
overall.
2) Is not suitable where metal coatings or steel substrate
are exposed.
Depends on the durability of the remaining original paint
system which is not subject to maintenance.

HM IV Maintenance 1 or 2 Coat
Short Possession System
The HM IV
maintenance paint system:
1) Is suitable for the maintenance of external surfaces of
existing structures immediately adjacent to railways or
highways where the length of available access time to
undertake the works is severely restricted due to limited
availability and/or duration of railway or highway
possession time. The use of the HM IV system should
only be considered as a last resort when use of other
paint systems that would provide a better durability can
be shown to be impractical, and where use under these
circumstances is agreed in advance with the
Overseeing Organisation.
2) The HM IV system should only be considered for use
on those areas of a structure where the limited access
time directly applies.
3) May be suitable for patch repairs but only under the
circumstances described in 1.
4) See guidance on whether stripe coats and/or a finish
coat may be omitted, given in Section 4 of this
document. Note that the omission of stripe coats and/or
a finish coat should be agreed at the time of agreeing
the use of the HM IV system with the Overseeing
Organisation.
5 to 10 years; highly dependent on the quality of
substrate preparation achieved, the prevailing
atmospheric/ environmental conditions when the painting
work is carried out and whether tripe coats and or a finish
coat are omitted.
HM V Maintenance of galvanised
coatings
The HM V
maintenance paint system:
1) Is suitable for the maintenance of sound galvanised
coatings.
2) Is not suitable for the maintenance of other exposed
metal coatings.
15 years; dependent on the extent of loss of the
galvanised coating
