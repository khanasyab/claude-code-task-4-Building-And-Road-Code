TD 131 Version 1.0.0
Introduction
Introduction
Background
The purpose of roadside technology is to contribute to safe and reliable journeys and to assist
customers by informing them about traffic conditions. The technology used on motorways and
all-purpose trunk roads contributes to these objectives by:
1)
monitoring - observing the network to detect incidents that could have an impact on the safety of
customers or their journey times;
2)
informing - providing customers with the information they need to make safe and informed
decisions whilst using the network;
3)
directing - controlling the flow of traffic on the network, and where appropriate enabling
enforcement activities.
This document references other documents that provide the criteria for provision and design
requirements for the roadside technology equipment and systems.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 10.N] apply to this document.
Where the design of the roadside technology and communications equipment has additional testing
requirements (such as contract- specific requirements), it is assumed that those requirements are to be
recorded in the works information.
