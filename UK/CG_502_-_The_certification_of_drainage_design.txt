2. Certification
2.
Certification
2.1
Drainage technical compliance shall be demonstrated for motorway and all-purpose trunk road
schemes except in the following instances:
1) a scheme which renews an existing asset or part of an asset and does not require amendments to
the drainage system, for example resurfacing of a road using the same or very similar type of
material as part of a renewal contract, does not need to demonstrate drainage technical compliance;
2) a scheme or technology project which has no drainage implications, for example installation of a
lighting column, does not need to demonstrate drainage technical compliance;
3) a scheme which involves the construction or modification to a highway feature covering an area of
land of less than one hectare and has an insignificant impact on the local drainage, for example
construction of a small traffic island, does not need to demonstrate drainage technical compliance.
2.2
Drainage technical compliance shall be demonstrated for all temporary works proposals unless they
meet the exemption requirements as described in Section 2 (Certification).
Responsibilities
2.3
The drainage design shall be certified for compliance with LA 113 [Ref 6.N] and CG 501 [Ref 1.N].
2.4
Those signing the certificate of compliance shall certify that it is possible to construct and manage the
scheme in accordance with the Manual of Contract Documents for Highway Works - SHW [Ref 4.N],
(NG for SHW) [Ref 5.N]and HCD (MCHW 3) [Ref 3.N]).
2.5
Those signing the certificate of compliance shall have the technical knowledge and competence in
design of highway drainage systems (e.g. chartered membership of a relevant engineering institution
or equivalent: i.e. a Chartered or Incorporated Civil or Highway Engineer).
2.6
Those counter-signing the certificate of compliance shall have the authority of the design organisation
to do so.
2.7
Compliance shall be demonstrated through the design organisation's quality management system.
2.8
Certification shall be provided with the final drainage design and prior to construction of any drainage
work in the scheme.
2.8.1
For large schemes, preliminary certification may be carried out at earlier stages of the design process.
2.9
A copy of the design certificate, together with a report on the drainage design, shall be uploaded to the
reports database on the Overseeing Organisation's data management system.
2.10
The report on the drainage design shall be formatted as described in Appendix B.
2.11
Any exceptions to certification of drainage technical compliance shall be proposed by the design
organisation.
2.12
The reasons for the exception, and the Overseeing Organisation's approval of the exception, shall be
recorded in the design documentation.
Drainage certificate
2.13
A drainage design certificate in the format given in Appendix A shall be completed for all drainage
designs unless they meet the exception requirements as described in Section 2 (Certification).
2.14
Where changes to the drainage design are required during the construction phase that affect the
required performance, a revised certificate shall be submitted with a report explaining why the changes
are necessary.
2.15
The revised certificate and report shall be uploaded to the report's database on the Overseeing
Organisation's data management system.
