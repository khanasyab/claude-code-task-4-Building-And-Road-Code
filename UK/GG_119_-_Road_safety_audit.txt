Introduction
Introduction
Background
The objective of the road safety audit process is to provide an effective, independent review of the road
safety implications of engineering interventions for all road users.
The Overseeing Organisations attach great importance to the improvement of road safety on the
motorway and trunk road network. The application of DMRB requirements, that are based on road
safety considerations, help achieve this objective.
However, even with the careful application of design standards by competent professionals, the design
process will not remove all hazards for road users.
The road safety audit process, as set out in this document, helps manage the interaction of different
design requirements for highway schemes.
The objective of road safety audit is to identify aspects of engineering interventions that could give rise
to road safety problems and to suggest modifications that could improve road safety. It is important to
note that road safety audit is not intended to be a technical check of compliance with design
requirements.
Although road safety has always been considered during design, road safety audit has existed for a
number of years to provide an independent check that the design characteristics do not contribute to
collisions and/or incidents on highway schemes.
Road safety audit is undertaken by staff with experience of collision data analysis and road safety
engineering and a reasonable understanding of highway design principles such as design requirements
and best practice. EU Directive 2008/96/EC [Ref 2.N] has mandated the road safety audit process and
associated qualification requirements across the European Community. Road safety audit is
undertaken at key stages in the design, construction and early operation of a highway scheme.
Although Overseeing Organisations and design teams do not necessarily contain staff with collision
data analysis and road safety engineering experience, these organisations play an equally important
role alongside road safety audit teams in achieving the objectives of the process. The road safety audit
process does not change the Overseeing Organisation's duty to manage safety for all populations and
undertake an appropriate level of risk assessment.
This document is sub-divided into sections aimed at the different parties in the road safety audit
process. It is expected that all parties will work in partnership (where appropriate) to identify, manage
and mitigate the hazards in the most appropriate way.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
It is assumed that the Overseeing Organisation involved in the road safety audit process will provide
the appropriate staff resources and technical support to undertake the process. This may include
seeking advice from other appropriate individuals.
It is assumed that staff with the appropriate competency and authority within the Overseeing
Organisation will be involved in the decision-making process when responding to RSA and deciding
upon subsequent actions.
It is assumed that RSA teams have an awareness of the principles of road design.
It is assumed that RSA teams have an awareness of the principles of road safety risk assessments,
and that identified RSA actions will be subject to formal design organisation risk assessments prior to
implementation.
It is assumed that the design organisation may not be present to assist in stage 4 road safety audits.

schemes in Scotland.
Interim road safety audit
The application of the road safety audit process to the whole
or part of a highway scheme at any time during its design
and construction. Interim road safety audit is neither
mandatory nor a substitute for the stage 1, 2, 3 and 4 road
safety audits.
Like-for-like maintenance highway
schemes
A highway scheme proposed as maintenance works, that
solely involves the replacement or refurbishment of a
highway feature with a corresponding feature which, as a
minimum, will appear the same, be located in the same
position, perform the same and be constructed of
comparable materials as the feature it replaces.
Maintaining agent
The organisation responsible for the ongoing maintenance
of the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network at the
highway scheme location.

Applicability of road safety audit
Trunk road and motorway network
2.1
Where there are physical changes to the highway impacting on road user behaviour or resulting in a
change to the outcome of a collision on the trunk road and motorway network, road safety audit (RSA)
shall apply, regardless of the procurement method.
NOTE 1
Temporary measures that last 6 months or longer in duration are considered to be physical changes to
the highway. Examples of such measures include:
1)
temporary traffic management, and,
2)
temporary changes to the highway not associated with the construction of a highway scheme.
NOTE 2
Temporary measures that last less than 6 months in duration are not considered to be physical
changes to the highway.
2.2
RSA shall not apply where a physical change to the highway will not impact on road user behaviour, or
change the outcome of a collision on the trunk road and motorway network.
2.3
The Overseeing Organisation shall produce an exemption file note to be kept on the scheme file (or
equivalent) where there is no need to apply RSA on the trunk road and motorway network.
NOTE
An exemption file note template is provided in Appendix A.

Undertaking the road safety audit
Scope of road safety audit
5.1
RSA shall only be concerned with road safety matters.
NOTE 1
RSA is not a technical check that the design conforms to standards and/or best practice guidance.
NOTE 2
RSA is not a check that the scheme has been constructed in accordance with the design.
NOTE 3
RSA does not consider structural safety.
NOTE 4
RSA does not cover health and safety issues concerning roadworkers during the construction,
maintenance and operation of the road.
5.2
Road safety matters resulting from the operation of facilities for highway maintenance that affect road
users shall be included in the scope of RSA.
5.3
The needs of all road users shall be assessed when undertaking the RSA.
Road safety audit brief
5.4
The RSA brief shall define the scope of the RSA to be undertaken.
5.5
Where the design of the highway scheme includes strategic decisions, this shall be clearly identified
within the RSA brief.

NOTE
The use of the word 'must' in RSA recommendations has the potential to be misinterpreted as an
instruction from the RSA team.
5.12
Recommendations to 'monitor' shall only be made where a need to supplement the stage 4 RSA is
specifically identified in terms of frequency and incidence of particular vehicle manoeuvres or collision
contributory factors and the monitoring task can be specifically allocated.

is contained in Appendix E.
5.16.1
Interim RSA may be applied at stages 1, 2 and 3.
Stage 1 road safety audit - Completion of preliminary design
5.17
Stage 1 RSA shall be undertaken at the completion of preliminary design, (for example at the order
publication report stage) before publication of draft orders.
NOTE
The end of the preliminary design stage is often the last occasion at which land requirements can have
the potential to be changed.
5.17.1
Stage 1 RSA should include road safety matters which have a bearing upon land take, licence or
easement before the draft orders are published or planning consent is applied for.
5.17.2
Where preliminary design is not undertaken, a stage 1 RSA may be combined with a stage 2 RSA at
the detailed design stage.
5.18
The RSA team shall review the preliminary design information provided with the RSA brief.
NOTE
Aspects that typically form the focus of the stage 1 RSA are included as Appendix B.

5. Undertaking the road safety audit
NOTE
Aspects that typically form the focus of the stage 2 RSA are included as Appendix B.
5.22
The stage 2 RSA shall include a review of the RSA actions in the stage 1 RSA response report.
5.23
RSA problems and recommendations relating to incomplete RSA actions in the stage 1 RSA shall be
reiterated at the stage 2 RSA.
5.24
Site visits shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements under Section 5 'road safety audit
site visits'.
Stage 3 road safety audit - Completion of construction
5.25
The stage 3 RSA shall be undertaken when the highway scheme construction is complete.
5.25.1
The stage 3 RSA should be undertaken before the scheme has opened to avoid the need for the RSA
team to traverse the site when fully open to traffic.
5.25.2
Where the stage 3 RSA cannot be undertaken before opening, alternative arrangements should be
agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Alternative arrangements include the RSA being carried out a short time after opening or in phases
where a scheme is subject to phased completion and opening.
5.25.3
The RSA team leader should discuss any alterations recommended at the stage 3 RSA with the
Overseeing Organisation to give the opportunity for modifications to be undertaken before opening.
NOTE
Early implementation of alterations recommended at the stage 3 RSA has the potential to provide a
safer working environment for the workforce and minimise delays to road users.
5.26
Stage 3 RSAs shall be carried out within 1 month of opening unless otherwise agreed with the
Overseeing Organisation.
5.27
RSA problems and recommendations raised in the stage 1 and stage 2 RSA shall be reviewed at the
stage 3 RSA and reiterated if the associated RSA actions are not complete.
5.28
The RSA team shall review the information provided with the RSA brief.
NOTE
Aspects that typically form the focus of the stage 3 RSA are included as Appendix B.
5.29
Site visits shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements under Section 5 'road safety audit
site visits'.
5.29.1
Where there is an accessibility issue that restricts the RSA team from accessing areas of the site,
reference to this should be included in the introduction of the RSA report.
NOTE
An example of an accessibility issue is an area of live motorway that cannot be accessed on foot.
5.30
The RSA team shall examine the highway scheme from the viewpoints of all road users.
5.30.1
The RSA team may decide to drive, walk, cycle and/or ride a horse through the scheme to assist their
evaluation.
5.31
The RSA team shall visit the site together in daylight and during the hours of darkness.
NOTE
The purpose of a site visit during darkness is to identify hazards specific to nighttime operation.
Stage 4 road safety audit - Post-opening monitoring
5.32
The Overseeing Organisation shall arrange for stage 4 RSA to be undertaken.
NOTE
The stage 4 RSA is an evidence-led review of road traffic collisions that have occurred in the vicinity of
the highway scheme.
5.33
Stage 4 RSA shall be carried out using 12 months of validated post- highway scheme-opening road
traffic collision data.

GG 119 Version 2.0.1
5. Undertaking the road safety audit
NOTE 1
Stage 4 RSAs are carried out so that any post-highway scheme-opening road safety matters can be
identified and remedial action taken.
NOTE 2
The lag in availability of validated road traffic collision data means the RSA can occur later than 12
months from the opening of the highway scheme.
NOTE 3
The availability of validated road traffic collision data varies depending on the individual Overseeing
Organisation.
5.34
A stage 4 RSA report shall be produced where road traffic collisions have been recorded in the vicinity
of the highway scheme over the 12-month period of validated road traffic collision data.
NOTE
A stage 4 RSA report is not needed where no road traffic collisions have been recorded in the vicinity of
the highway scheme over the 12-month period of post-opening validated road traffic collision data.
5.35
If the Overseeing Organisation decides not to proceed further with the stage 4 RSA reporting, this
decision shall be recorded, and kept on the highway scheme file (or equivalent).
5.36
Where a stage 4 RSA report is required, a RSA brief shall be prepared and issued to the RSA team by
the Overseeing Organisation.
5.36.1
The production of the RSA brief may be delegated to the design organisation where they are retained
post-highway scheme completion.
5.36.2
Where there have been highway layout changes following the period the scheme first became
operational, the stage 4 RSA brief should make reference to these changes.
5.36.3
Where operational data exists, this should be provided with the RSA brief to enable the RSA team to
understand the implications of any road safety matters that have not resulted in reported collisions.
5.37
The stage 4 RSA report shall include any RSA problems indicated by the road traffic collision data
analysis and operational data and, where necessary, include RSA recommendations for remedial
action.
NOTE
A stage 4 RSA report template is provided in Appendix E.
5.38
During the stage 4 RSA, road traffic collision data shall be analysed in detail by the RSA team to
identify:
1)
higher than expected numbers of road traffic collisions that have occurred since the scheme
became operational (when compared to control data);
2)
locations at which road traffic collisions have occurred; and
3)
road traffic collisions that appear to arise from similar causes or show common factors or trends.
5.38.1
The analysis of road traffic collision data should include identification of changes in the collision trends
in terms of number, rate (taking account of any traffic flow changes), types and other collision variables,
and comparisons with control data.
5.39
The RSA team shall visit the sites of highway schemes if characteristics within the road traffic collision
data show:
1)
higher than expected numbers of road traffic collisions have occurred since the scheme became
operational (when compared to control data);
2)
the road traffic collision rate or severity has increased since the scheme became operational;
3)
common trends (e.g. a high frequency of road traffic collisions during the hours of darkness or on
a wet road surface); or,
4)
road safety matters related to vulnerable road users.
5.39.1
Where a site visit is needed, the RSA team should decide if the road traffic collision data analysis
justifies an inspection during a particular time period and record their decision making within the RSA
report.
NOTE
A particular time period could be during the hours of darkness or a peak period.

The RSA team shall determine the need to vary the time of the site visit to observe specific traffic
conditions at all stages of RSA.
NOTE
Specific traffic conditions can include peak periods, the beginning or end of the school day, or during
frequent events.
Interim RSA
5.44
The Overseeing Organisation shall decide whether to undertake an interim RSA.
NOTE 1
Interim RSA can provide the benefit of early identification of potential road safety problems leading to
savings in both programme and design costs.
NOTE 2
Interim RSA is particularly beneficial to larger projects with accelerated programmes, such as highway
schemes involving early contractor involvement.
NOTE 3
Interim RSA supplements the RSA at stages 1, 2 and 3.
NOTE 4
Interim RSA does not replace a particular stage of RSA.
5.45
The RSA process for an interim RSA shall be completed in accordance with the requirements of the
relevant RSA stage.
5.45.1
Interim RSA may be undertaken during the construction process with the agreement of the Overseeing
Organisation.
5.45.2

trunk road and motorway network, the process set out in this document shall be followed for all stages
of RSA including appointment and approval of the RSA team.
NOTE
The highway scheme can be designed by an organisation working for the third-party organisation
rather than an organisation working for the Overseeing Organisation.
5.46.1
A stage 1 RSA report should be undertaken before planning consent is applied for, as this
demonstrates that the potential for road user safety issues has been addressed.
NOTE
The third party organisation-led scheme is submitted for planning approval to the local planning
authority and, where there are highway implications, the highway or Overseeing Organisation is
consulted.

Training routes
Table G.1 summarises the two routes by which a certificate of competency in road safety audit is
obtained; the portfolio of evidence route and the training route. It is envisaged that a training course
covering the core modules in the training curriculum in table 2 will be of the order of two days duration.
Table G.1 Routes to obtaining a certificate of competency
Portfolio of evidence route
Training course route
Evidence to be included in the portfolio:
Details of how the candidate meets the RSA
team training, skills and experience guidance
contained in Section 3 of this document.
Example RSA reports with details of the
candidate's contribution to the road safety audit
process and production of the road safety audit
reports.
A witness statement from an appropriate person
vouching for the content of the candidate's
portfolio submission and that the candidate has
an acceptable level of understanding of the core
modules identified in this appendix. The witness
to hold a recognised qualification in the field of
road safety, civil engineering or transportation
planning or hold a senior professional position
within a relevant company or organisation.
The portfolio of evidence is signed by the
candidate and submitted to an independent
professional organisation or company who have
had their certification process accepted by
National Highways on behalf of all the
Overseeing Organisations. This professional
organisation or company is responsible for
reviewing candidate's submissions and, where
appropriate, issuing the certificate of competency
in road safety audit.
Prior to completion of the training course and
issue of a certificate of competency, the
candidate submits the following to the training
provider:
Details of how the candidate meets the RSA
team training, skills and experience guidance
contained in Section 3 of this document.
Example RSA reports with details of the
candidate's contribution to the road safety audit
process and production of the road safety audit
reports.
A witness statement, from an appropriate person
which vouches for the content of the above
submissions. This witness to hold a recognised
qualification in the field of road safety, civil
engineering or transportation planning or hold a
senior professional position within a relevant
company or organisation.
The course provider assesses the candidates
regarding their understanding of the content of
the training course and verifies the evidence
submitted.
Where a candidate has demonstrated to the
training provider that they meet the training, skills
and experience guidance and understood the
content of the training course, the training
provider is responsible for issuing the certificate
of competency in RSA.

Road safety engineering/ road design
This module includes development in road
safety engineering and its influence on road
design, with focus on the trunk road and
motorway network.
The 2008/96/EC [Ref 2.N] specifically requires
training or experience in road design. Road
safety auditors should have an understanding
of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges
(DMRB) design standards, and how good
design principles reduce collision risk. The
module could include the following:
Road/junction geometry and design:
1) design speed;
2) horizontal and vertical alignment, including
cross sections, drainage, stopping sight
distances and adverse camber;
3) appropriateness of junction type;
4) visibility; and,
5) road surfaces, including the use of high
friction surfacing.
Roadside features:
1) passive infrastructure;
2) road restraint systems and guard railing;
3) landscaping; and,
4) highway lighting.
Facilities for vulnerable road users:
1) pedestrian / cycling / equestrian facilities;
2) mobility and visually impaired; and,
3) motorcyclists.
