Assessment methodology
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall report on:
1) the likely nature and scale of geology and soils effects (positive, neutral or negative) during the
construction and the operational phases of the project;
2) the likelihood of a project to result in significant effects; and
3) the issues requiring further assessment and the methods to be applied.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall identify potential significant effects by answering the following questions
to gain an understanding of the need to undertake further assessment:
1) is the project likely to affect designated geological sites (statutory or non statutory)?;
2) is the project likely to affect the function or quality of soil as a resource?;
3) is the project likely to affect agricultural land classified as best and most versatile (BMV) or prime
land?;
4) is the project likely to disturb historical contamination?;
5) is the project likely to introduce significant sources of contamination?
3.3
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
NOTE
It is possible to scope in one element of assessment, e.g. geology, and scope out another, e.g.
contamination.
3.4
The scoping assessment shall include reliable design, mitigation and best practice measures when
reporting against the above points.
3.4.1
Where elements are scoped out from further assessment on the basis there is not likely to be
significant effects, appropriate environmental management measures should still be recorded and
implemented within an environmental management plan (EMP).
Study area
3.5
The study area shall be identified on a project by project basis based on the following:
1) the construction footprint/project boundary (including compounds and temporary land take);
2) the location of contamination outside the project boundary / footprint that have the potential to
migrate on site and effect receptors; and
3) the location of sensitive off site receptors (i.e. designated sites) that can be affected by the project,
i.e by re-mobilisation or introduction of contaminants.
Baseline scenario
3.6
Where the need for further assessment has been established, the following shall be identified:
1) the location of designated and non designated geological sites / features, e.g;
a) Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI);
b) Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI);
c) Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS);
d) Local Geological / Geodiversity Sites (LGS);
e) Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites; and
f) Earth Science Conservation Review sites (ESCR);
2) identification of the agricultural classification of land (agricultural land classification (ALC) or Land
Classification for Agriculture (LCA)) affected by a project; and

assessment conclusions.
3.7
The desk study shall establish the nature of the underlying bedrock geology and superficial deposits.
3.8
The desk study shall identify potential sources of contamination associated with current and historical
land uses, and pathways to receptors.

The desk study may be compiled in the form of a PSSR (see Appendix D of CD 622 [Ref 12.N]) the
conclusions from which can inform the baseline scenario.
3.9
The baseline scenario within environmental assessments shall report on the proportion of identified
ALC / LCA types within a region (i.e. the relative abundance of soil type in the wider geographic area
and / or its contribution to a cohesive network).
3.10
The baseline scenario shall be informed by existing survey data, such as geo-environmental data
obtained from site investigation(s) and monitoring data, where this information is available.
3.10.1

3. Assessment methodology
NOTE
Soils not categorised as best and most versatile or prime land can be allocated in a higher sensitivity
category where particular agricultural practices contribute to the quality and character of the
environment or local economy (e.g. in upland areas where lower quality agricultural land is integral to
agricultural practices).
3.12
The magnitude of change shall be reported in the assessment in accordance with the criteria provided
in Table 3.12.
Table 3.12 Magnitude of impact and typical descriptions
Magnitude of impact
(change)
Typical description
Major
Geology: loss of geological feature / designation and/or quality and
integrity, severe damage to key characteristics, features or
elements.
Soil: physical removal or permanent sealing of soil resource or
agricultural land.
Contamination:
1) human health: significant contamination identified.
Contamination levels significantly exceed background levels
and relevant screening criteria (e.g. category 4 screening levels)
SP1010 [Ref 4.N] with potential for significant harm to human
health. Contamination heavily restricts future use of land;
2) surface water: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and
water environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N]; and
3) groundwater: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and water
environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N].
Moderate
Geology: partial loss of geological feature / designation, potentially
adversely affecting the integrity; partial loss of/damage to key
characteristics, features or elements.
Soils: permanent loss / reduction of one or more soil function(s)
and restriction to current or approved future use (e.g through
degradation, compaction, erosion of soil resource.)
Contamination:
1) human health: contaminant concentrations exceed background
levels and are in line with limits of relevant screening criteria
(e.g. category 4 screening levels) SP1010 [Ref 4.N].
Significant contamination can be present. Control / remediation
measures are required to reduce risks to human health / make
land suitable for intended use;
2) surface water: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and
water environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N]; and
3) groundwater: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and water
environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N].

3. Assessment methodology
Table 3.12 Magnitude of impact and typical descriptions (continued)
Magnitude of impact
(change)
Typical description
Minor
Geology: minor measurable change in geological feature /
designation attributes, quality or vulnerability; minor loss of, or
alteration to, one (maybe more) key characteristics, features or
elements.
Soils: temporary loss / reduction of one or more soil function(s) and
restriction to current or approved future use (e.g through
degradation, compaction, erosion of soil resource.)
Contamination:
1) human health: contaminant concentrations are below relevant
screening criteria (e.g. category 4 screening levels) SP1010
[Ref 4.N]. Significant contamination is unlikely with a low risk to
human health. Best practice measures can be required to
minimise risks to human health;
2) surface water: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and
water environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N]; and
3) groundwater: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and water
environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N].
Negligible
Geology: very minor loss or detrimental alteration to one or more
characteristics, features or elements of geological feature /
designation. Overall integrity of resource not affected.
Soils: no discernible loss / reduction of soil function(s) that restrict
current or approved future use.
Contamination:
1) human health: contaminant concentrations substantially below
levels outlined in relevant screening criteria (e.g. category 4
screening levels) SP1010 [Ref 4.N]. No requirement for control
measures to reduce risks to human health / make land suitable
for intended use;

Magnitude of impact
(change)
Typical description
No change
Geology: no temporary or permanent loss / disturbance of
characteristics features or elements.
Soils: no loss / reduction of soil function(s) that restrict current or
approved future use.
Contamination:
1) human health: reported contaminant concentrations below
background levels;
2) surface water; use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and
water environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N]; and
3) groundwater: use sensitivity criteria in Road drainage and water
environment LA 113 [Ref 15.N].
3.13
The requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall be referred to in support of the criteria outlined
in Table 3.12.
3.13.1
A major magnitude impact for soils should be allocated where there is a discernible level of physical
removal / permanent sealing of agricultural land.
3.14
The approach to deriving impact significance from receptor value and magnitude of effects shall be in
accordance with LA 104 [Ref 6.N] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
NOTE
Significant effects typically comprise effects that remain within the moderate, large or very large
categories once mitigation has been taken into account.
3.14.1
Improvements from baseline conditions (positive effects) should be identified and reported within
environmental assessments.
Design and mitigation
3.15
The design and mitigation hierarchy outlined in LA 104 [Ref 6.N] Environmental assessment and
monitoring shall be applied to avoid, reduce and remediate (offset) effects on geology and soils.
3.16
Where effects on geological sites / features and soils cannot be avoided through alignment / design
choices, effects shall be reduced by minimising a project's footprint.
3.17
Enhancement opportunities shall be identified during the design process and reported within
environmental assessments.
NOTE
Examples or enhancement opportunities comprise improving the condition of existing geological
exposures, or creating new geological exposures within design parameters and improving scientific
data /understanding.)
3.18
Impacts on soil resources during the construction phase shall be managed / minimised through an EMP.
3.18.1
The management measures within the EMP should be in accordance with:
1) CoP sustainable use of soils [Ref 1.N]; and
2) BS 3882:2015 [Ref 19.N], BS 8601:2013 [Ref 18.N] and MCHW [Ref 13.N] requirements for use of
soil on construction sites.
3.18.2
Re-use of soils generated during the construction phase should be in accordance with;
1) CL:AIRE The Definition of Waste Code of Practice ISBN 978-1-905046-23-2 [Ref 3.N];

5) in agreement with the relevant local authority.
3.19
Where a preliminary risk assessment has identified the need for remediation measures, a remediation
options appraisal shall be completed in accordance with CLR11 (Model Procedures for the
Management of Land Contamination) ( CLR11 [Ref 2.N] and / or BS10175:2011 BS 10175:2011 +

4.1
Where significant effects following the inclusion of design and mitigation measures have been
identified, the EMP shall be reviewed and updated to demonstrate the implementation of specified
mitigation and enhancement measures, relating to:
1) geology;
2) soil resources; and
3) contamination (remediation measures).
4.2
Where the need for remediation of contaminated land has been identified, monitoring requirements
shall be agreed with the authorities likely to be concerned by a project.
4.3
Where there are development or planning requirements to undertake mitigation measures, monitoring
shall support these requirements being discharged prior to occupation.

Consultation
S/1.1
Transport Scotland shall be consulted prior to consultation with the authorities likely to be concerned by
a project.
S/1.2
Consultation shall be undertaken with the authorities likely to be concerned by a project when the
project is contrary to an approved or adopted local plan and involves:
1) 2 hectares or more of prime agricultural land;
2) 10 hectares or more of agricultural land not classified as prime; or
3) any impact on any classification of agricultural land where authorities likely to be concerned by a
project have reason to believe that there are particular local factors which could justify the need for
protection on agricultural grounds.
S/1.3
Consultation shall be undertaken with the authorities likely to be concerned by a project when the
project is located in an area where no local plan is in place and involves:
1) 2 hectares or more of prime agricultural land; or
2) 10 hectares or more of agricultural land not classified as prime;
3) any impact on any classification of agricultural land where authorities likely to be concerned by a
project have reason to believe that there are particular local factors which could justify the need for
protection on agricultural grounds
S/1.4
Where projects have the potential to impact or affect croft land the authorities likely to be concerned by
a project shall be consulted on the special circumstances that apply.
NOTE
The authorities likely to be concerned by a project for crofting land are the Crofting Commission.
