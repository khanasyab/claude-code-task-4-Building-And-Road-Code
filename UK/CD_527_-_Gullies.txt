Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document gives the requirements and advice related to the use of gullies. Both conventional
gullies and sumpless gullies form part of a kerb and gully drainage system.
Sumpless gullies offer an environmental advantage in situations where there is a risk of anaerobic
liquor being washed into a watercourse. They may not be appropriate in all locations and the
environmental advantages should be weighed against maintenance aspects and the practicalities of
the downstream pipework.
The grating on conventional and sumpless gullies will trap very coarse debris. Though a conventional
sump will trap some of the sediment they are relatively ineffective at reducing pollution and can,
through poor maintenance practices, generate polluting materials. The Environment Agency have
expressed their concerns that the principal source of pollution in conventional gullies arises from the
bacterial action of degrading organic materials contained within the coarse debris and the sediment
within the sump. The bacterial action creates a high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which means
that the liquor will tend to remove the oxygen from any water into which it is discharged. Often referred
to as the "first flush", highly polluted liquor is discharged during the initial stages of a storm event.
Although maintenance practices and cleansing operations should ensure this potentially polluting liquor
is not washed into the drainage system, during dry periods, when there is no rainfall to provide a
residual flow of water within the drain to dilute the liquor, there is a risk that severe pollution of the
receiving water courses could occur.
This document supersedes Highway Construction Details, F series, drawings 13 and 14 (HCDs F13
and F14).
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

2. Design requirements
2.30
The crown and haunch of the outlet pipe from the sumpless gully shall be lower than the adjacent kerb
race.
2.31
Where sumpless gullies are located on embankments and discharge to toe ditches at the base of the
embankment, the system shall be designed to ensure that there is no detrimental effect on the
embankment slope stability.
2.32
Sumpless gullies located on embankments shall have a kerb as part of the overall carriageway design.
2.32.1
Sumpless gullies may be used on the approaches to over-bridges.
2.32.2
Sumpless gullies should be used where the approach to an over-bridge is on embankment.
Pipe network
2.33
The drainage system's pipe network shall be designed in accordance with CD 523 [Ref 3.N] and the
requirements within this document.
2.33.1
Where the drainage system design includes sumpless gullies, the calculation of sediment load,
gradient, flow and discharge rate in accordance with CD 523 [Ref 3.N] may be amended by the
requirements within this document.
2.33.2
Due to the increase in sediment load, steeper pipe gradients than those in CD 523 [Ref 3.N] may be
used to achieve the minimum self-cleansing velocities in the downstream pipe network in accordance
with the tables in the design requirements.
NOTE 1
Sumpless gullies can cause an increased amount of sediment to be passed to the downstream
drainage system due to no sediment load being stored in the gully.
NOTE 2
It can be advantageous for a drainage system design utilising sumpless gullies to also utilise a vortex
separator in accordance with CD 528 [Ref 7.N].
2.33.3
Where sumpless gullies are considered as a retrofit or as part of an improvement scheme the existing
drainage system may have to be reassessed for the additional sediment load.
2.34
Where sumpless gullies form part of the drainage system design, sediment shall be transported
through the downstream pipe network without deposition.
2.34.1
The drainage system should allow for deposition at the catchpits or vortex separator only.
2.35
Where self-cleansing velocities in the downstream pipe network cannot be achieved in accordance with
CD 523 [Ref 3.N] and the requirements within this document, sumpless gullies shall not be used as part
of the drainage system design.
2.36
When designing the pipe network for a drainage system which includes sumpless gullies, the pipe
roughness ks in the Colebrook-White [Ref 5.I] equation shall equal 3 mm.
2.37
The tables for minimum velocities for pipe network cases A, B, C and D shall be used for the design of
minimum velocities at pipe-full conditions.

junctions in branched systems, the catchpit number is counted from the upstream end of the branch
having the largest number of catchpits.
NOTE 2
When catchpits are used the sediment concentration decreases towards the downstream end of the
system. This reduces the required values of minimum velocity and enables the pipes to be laid at flatter
gradients than would be the case with benched manholes that do not trap any sediment.

Design for operation and maintenance
3.1
Gullies shall be recorded, on new and existing drainage systems, as a point asset in accordance with
the Overseeing Organisation's drainage database management system and, if sumpless, include a
specific attribute for not having a sump.
3.2
The design of a drainage system, which includes sumpless gullies, shall deliver a maintenance
frequency that is the same as a drainage system including conventional gullies.
3.3
Where the design of the drainage system includes sumpless gullies, the catchpits within the system
shall be designed to have the volume required to store the increased sediment load.
NOTE
Designing the catchpits within the system to have the volume required to store the increased sediment
load can cause the drainage system to have catchpits at more frequent intervals.

Debris and sediment
Debris accumulates on the carriageway from a number of sources. They can be actual pieces of
vehicle, typically windscreen and headlamp glass, tyre debris, pieces of bumper or exhaust or simply
corroded steel. Debris can also originate from material thrown from moving vehicles, for example
cigarette ends and packets, drinks bottles, cans and paper, etc. The third source of debris is organic in
nature. This can derive from plant die-back, leaf and tree debris, and dead animals. A further source of
debris and sediment is the pavement itself resulting from resurfacing works, abrasion/removal of grit
and salting operations.
During periods of rainfall, sediment can be washed on to the carriageway from the adjacent unpaved
areas, and under moderate wind conditions is blown on to the carriageway from considerable
distances. This sediment is generally in the form of fine silt particles or coarser granular sediment. The
debris and sediment are carried along in the surface water runoff from the carriageway to the gullies.
To minimise the amount of sediment and debris entering (the pipeline or) the receiving watercourse,
measures are taken throughout the drainage system.
The rate of sediment deposition is a function of sediment load, pipe diameter, pipe roughness and pipe
gradient. This is because these attributes influence the velocity of flow within the pipe. Tests carried out
in support of this document, ( HRW SR 604 [Ref 3.I]) showed that only minor deposition would be likely
to occur with sumpless gullies if the downstream pipe gradients are 1 in 100 or steeper. The most
common method of improving the sediment transport capacity of a pipeline is to increase the gradients
of the pipes. Transport capacity can also be increased by slightly relaxing the self-cleansing
requirements and designing the pipeline to operate satisfactorily with a small amount of sediment
deposition. A more detailed explanation of the process can be found in CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I]. The
tables within the design requirements section of this document were produced using methods
recommended in CIRIA R141 [Ref 1.I] and described in HRW SR 604 [Ref 3.I], with the following
assumptions: pipe wall roughness of 0.6 mm; and maximum depth of sediment deposit equal to 1% of
the pipe diameter giving an effective overall roughness of about ks = 3mm .
A2
Conventional gully pots
The efficiency of a conventional gully pot to retain debris and fine sediment is a function of flow rate and
sediment particle size. Conventional gully pots can be effective at retaining some 90% of sediment of
d50 = 0.8mm . This efficiency drops considerably to around 25% if the retained sediment level
approaches the maximum level before blockage of the outlet occurs.
The principle behind the use of gully pots is to reduce the amount of coarse sediment that enters the
drainage system. The presence of sediment in the drainage system increases frictional forces leading
to a reduction in the flow velocity and ultimately to blockages. The conventional gully pot comprises a
sump below the level of the outlet pipe. The outlet can be trapped, meaning that there is a form of
"weir" to reduce the risk of debris being washed into the connection and the carrier drain. As oil floats
on water the provision of the trap will retain oils within the pot and prevent them being washed into the
drain. The outlet from the pot to the trap is below the water level in the pot. The second, less common
form of conventional gully has no trap, simply having the outlet connection above the sump in the pot.
This type of pot will not retain oils, but will retain most of the coarser sediments.
A3
The benefits of sumpless gullies
The use of sumpless gullies can provide benefits by:
1)
preventing contaminated silt and liquor accumulation;
2)
helping to eliminate the "first flush" of heavily polluted flow as the gully starts to operate;
3)
eliminating or reducing the need to clean the pots with the risk of contaminated water from the pot
being used in the cleaning process.

Appendix A. Generic details
The chute type of sumpless gully is more appropriate for either steep carriageways, where steep
downstream pipework is achievable, or for flat carriageways in low-lying areas where the individual
outlets pipes can be steep.
There can be significant variation in the time and energy required to install the supporting surrounds to
different types of sumpless gully. This should be considered when investigating the relative merits of
each type of sumpless gully system.

Appendix B. Worked example for drainage design using sump...
Appendix B. Worked example for drainage design using sumpless gullies
This example illustrates how a carrier pipe system should be designed for a road drained by sumpless
gullies. The drainage pipe system includes five catchpits, where sediment is collected, and pipework
receiving nine gully connections between adjacent pairs of catchpits. It is assumed that the flow rate
from each of the gullies is the same, equal to 2.8 l/s. The catchpits are numbered from upstream: C1,
C2, etc.
In this example, the objective is to determine the pipe diameters and gradients necessary to achieve
minimum self-cleansing velocities in the whole system. In this example the 'Tables for the hydraulic
design of pipes, sewers and channels ( HRW Tables [Ref 4.I])' were used for the determination of the
pipe sizes and diameters that would ensure flow velocities equal to, or greater than, those given in
design requirements of this document.
The 'Tables for the hydraulic design of pipes, sewers and channels ( HRW Tables [Ref 4.I])' are based
on the Colebrook-White [Ref 5.I] equation and the roughness value used was ks = 3mm . When more
than one pipe diameter satisfied the requirement for minimum flow velocity, the criterion used was to
select the pipe diameter associated with the flattest gradient. From the table for design options and use
of tables for minimum velocities for pipe network cases A, B, C and D for a system consisting of
sumpless gullies and five catchpits, the values of minimum flow velocity are obtained from tables for
minimum velocities for pipe network case A to C within the design requirements.
In each pipe run between catchpits, the pipe section immediately upstream of the catchpit has the
highest sediment concentration, whereas the pipe section immediately downstream of the catchpit will
have the lowest concentration, since the sediment will tend to deposit in the catchpit. In this example
pipe sizes and gradients were determined for each of these upstream and downstream sections.
B1
Upstream of Catchpit 1, C1:
First pipe section; Q = 2.8 l/s
Choose minimum pipe size, 150 mm diameter. From case A of Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing
flow velocity is 0.69 m/s. From the hydraulic design, a 150 mm diameter pipe at 1/125 gradient will
convey 12.2 l/s with V=0.693 m/s. This pipe will flow part full.
Section u/s of C1; Q = 25.2 l/s
Assume pipe diameter of 200 mm; from case A of Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing flow velocity is
0.78 m/s. From the hydraulic design tables, a 200 mm diameter pipe at 1/133 gradient will convey 25.7
l/s with V=0.818 m/s (>0.78 m/s). [If the designer chooses a large pipe diameter than required, they
should check the larger diameter pipe still satisfies the minimum flow velocity].
B2
From C1 to C2:
Section d/s of C1; Q = 25.2 l/s
200 mm diameter; 1/133 gradient.
Section u/s of C2; Q = 50.4 l/s
Assume pipe diameter of 225 mm; since this section is downstream of Catchpit 1, from case B of
Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing flow velocity is 0.72 m/s. A 225 mm diameter pipe at 1/63
gradient will convey the required flow but the gradient is considered too steep. Consider a 275 mm
diameter pipe; from case B, the self-cleansing velocity is 0.76 m/s. This pipe will convey the flow at
1/182 gradient with velocity = 0.869 m/s > 0.76 m/s. [If the designer chooses a large pipe diameter than
required, they should check the larger diameter pipe still satisfies the minimum flow velocity].
Section d/s of C2; Q = 50.4 l/s

275 mm diameter; 1/182 gradient.
Section u/s of C3; Q = 75.6 l/s
Assume pipe diameter of 300 mm; from case B of Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing flow velocity is
0.79 m/s. A 300 mm diameter pipe at 1/133 gradient will convey the required flow at a velocity above
the self-cleansing velocity. [If the designer chooses a large pipe diameter than required, they should
check the larger diameter pipe still satisfies the minimum flow velocity].
B3
From C3 to C4:
Section d/s of C3; Q = 75.6 l/s
300 mm diameter; 1/133 gradient.
Section u/s of C4; Q = 100.8 l/s
Assume pipe diameter of 375 mm; from case B of Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing flow velocity is
0.87 m/s. A 375 mm diameter pipe at 1/238 gradient will convey the required flow at a velocity above
the self-cleansing velocity.
B4
From C4 to C5:
Section d/s of C4; Q = 100.8 l/s
375 mm diameter; 1/238 gradient (V=0.934 m/s larger than minimum self-cleansing velocity of 0.77
m/s, in case C – this table is applicable because the section is downstream of Catchpit 4).
Section u/s of C5; Q = 126 l/s
Assume pipe diameter of 450 mm; from case C of Section 2, the minimum self-cleansing flow velocity
is 0.79 m/s. A 450 mm diameter pipe at 1/417 gradient will convey the required flow at a velocity above
the self-cleansing velocity. A 400 mm pipe at a 1/217 gradient would equally satisfy the requirements.
