confused with indirect cost items and/or other preliminary items priced separately by the Contractor,
e.g. those included under GC 990/MMHW [Ref 14.N].
Note b
Provision is made in clause 1.27 of this document for the inclusion of "Special Preliminary" items in the
Bill of Quantities.
1.6
The inclusion of "Special Preliminary" items in a Contract shall be entirely at the discretion of the
Overseeing Organisation.
Note
"Special Preliminary" items are not included in the Method of Measurement as their use is intended to
be restricted and particular to a given Contract.
1.7
"Special Preliminary" items shall not be used for temporary works, cofferdams, accesses, advance
operations and the like unless the work or operation is not typical in relation to the Works, and:
a)
the magnitude of such work, not separately measured, is such as to be disproportionately
high in cost in relation to the measured work with which it is associated; or
b)
an operation, not separately measured, is required to be executed far in advance or after
the main measured operation to which it relates.
1.8
Whether a "Special Preliminary" item is included in the Bill of Quantities or not shall in no way relieve
the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract.
Alternative types of pavement
1.9
Where the Contract provides for the tenderer to select the Type of Pavement to be constructed from a
range of alternatives a separate Bill of Quantities shall be provided within CC 601/MMHW [Ref 10.N], of
the Roadworks General Bill; CC 201/MMHW [Ref 3.N], CC 202/MMHW [Ref 4.N], CC 203/MMHW [Ref
5.N], CC 204/MMHW [Ref 6.N], CC 205/MMHW [Ref 7.N] and CC 206/MMHW [Ref 8.N] of the Main
Carriageway, Interchanges and Side Roads Bills for each Type of Pavement permitted by the Contract.
1.10
Each of the individual Bills of Quantities within CC 601/MMHW [Ref 10.N] of the Roadworks General
Bill and in CC 201/MMHW [Ref 3.N], CC 202/MMHW [Ref 4.N], CC 203/MMHW [Ref 5.N], CC
204/MMHW [Ref 6.N], CC 205/MMHW [Ref 7.N] and CC 206/MMHW [Ref 8.N] of the Main
Carriageway, Interchanges and Side Roads Bills shall be based on the thinnest pavement permitted by
the Contract for the particular Type of Pavement to which it refers.
1.11
Immediately preceding the separate sets of alternative Bills in CC 601/MMHW [Ref 10.N] and CC
201/MMHW [Ref 3.N], CC 202/MMHW [Ref 4.N], CC 203/MMHW [Ref 5.N], CC 204/MMHW [Ref 6.N],
CC 205/MMHW [Ref 7.N] and CC 206/MMHW [Ref 8.N] respectively an Index in clause 1.28 of this
document shall be provided of the Types of Pavement permitted by the Contract.
1.12
Provision shall be made for only the one Bill of Quantities in CC 601/MMHW [Ref 10.N] of the
Roadworks General Bill and in CC 201/MMHW [Ref 3.N], CC 202/MMHW [Ref 4.N], CC 203/MMHW
[Ref 5.N], CC 204/MMHW [Ref 6.N], CC 205/MMHW [Ref 7.N] and CC 206/MMHW [Ref 8.N] of the
Main Carriageway, Interchanges and Side Roads Bills which relates to the Type of Pavement elected to
be constructed by the Contractor, to be priced and included in the tender total.
Structures where a choice of designs is offered
1.13
Where the Contract provides for a structure designed by the Contractor to be constructed as an
alternative to the structure which has been designed by the Overseeing Organisation, a separate Bill of
Quantities shall be provided for each of the two construction procedures permitted by the Contract.
1.14
Each of the two individual Bills of Quantities shall be provided in accordance with the various methods
of measurement for all the works contained within the Designated Outline (with the exception of those
works scheduled as not to be included).
1.15
For the structure designed by the Contractor the Bill of Quantities shall comprise a single item in
accordance with CC 605/MMHW [Ref 11.N], CC 606/MMHW [Ref 12.N] and CC 607/MMHW [Ref 13.N].

aggregate used.

Where the contract provides for the measurement of bituminous regulating course by tonnage a
contract specific table should be prepared by the compiler and included within the Bill of Quantities in
the format shown above indicating factors for those materials and aggregates permitted by the Contract.
Note b
The factors should represent the variation in the relative densities of the permitted aggregates
compared to a base factor of 1.00 attributed to one of the permitted aggregates. It is intended that, by
application of these factors to the certified tonnage of material, a common measured tonnage is
derived, irrespective of the particular aggregate used.
