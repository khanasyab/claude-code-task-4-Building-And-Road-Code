Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Highways England-specific requirements related to scheme
billboards providing roadwork information to customers.
Highways England, as part of its customer service strategy PR101/15 2016 [Ref 1.I] has introduced
customer service standards (CSSs) to challenge management and employees to meet the needs and
expectations of our customers. Our customer service strategy identified that our customers want to
trust what they are being told, feel in control and have stress-free journeys.
This scheme billboard CSS will encourage best practice and a consistent application of the existing
guidance around provision of scheme information to customers as they experience any of Highways
England's significant road works.
The document will mandate a consistent application of the provision of scheme information to
customers as they travel through road works.
This document will address road user views raised within the Transport Focus report "Incidents and
road works. A road user perspective" Incidents and Roadworks [Ref 2.I] which stated: "Road users felt
that 'advance notice' road works information is important at the roadside, particularly for drivers who
use a particular road regularly. Key requirements were felt to be:
1) start dates and duration;
2) how I will be affected;
3) what is being done; and,
4) how I will benefit.
Billboards do not provide directional information to customers on the motorway and all-purpose trunk
road network. Instead they provide information about the roadworks taking place.
This document will also enable Highways England to demonstrate that it is listening and responding to
customer concerns, and is now delivering roadworks in a way that better meets its customers'
expectations.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
