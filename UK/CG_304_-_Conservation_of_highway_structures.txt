Introduction
Introduction
Background
There is a general public interest in historic bridges, to maintain them and to resist modernisation or
replacement. The publication 'Conservation of Bridges' Wallsgrove et al 2002 [Ref 1.I] provides
background examples and advice on conservation methods and techniques for bridges. This document
complements the publication by dealing with procedural requirements of conservation.
Where maintenance work is required for highway structures it is usually preferable to conserve and
retain wherever practicable. Replacement should only be undertaken as a last resort. Conservation is
economical in the use of natural resources and is a particularly sustainable form of construction, which
does not necessarily add to the costs of managing historic structures.
This document provides requirements and advice on the procedures required for conservation of the
different types of highway structures managed by Overseeing Organisations. The document applies to
scheduled monuments, listed structures, structures within conservation areas and structures deemed
by the Overseeing Organisation to be of conservation merit. It covers procedures, conservation
strategies, applications and management.
Highway structures that are neither scheduled or listed that merit conservation include the following:
1) structures having historic, cultural, and/or architectural merit as determined by the Overseeing
Organisation; and,
2) structures within conservation areas, National Parks, World Heritage Sites, sites in the inventory of
gardens and designed landscapes etc, where the Overseeing Organisation deems that conservation
measures need to be applied.
As procedures for conservation differ across the UK, this document has a common core supplemented
by annexes dealing with the differing legislation and requirements.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 2.N].

Conservation strategies
Principles of conservation
3.1
The following principles of conservation shall be applied:
1) structures kept in use and maintained in their original form and performing the same function and
structural action;
2) minimal changes to the structure and its appearance;
3) modifications involve no loss in character, minimal loss of historic fabric and minimal adverse effect
on the setting;
4) minimal introduction of new material additional to the original fabric;
5) any new materials to be in keeping with the original fabric;
6) all work undertaken using methods of working and materials to reflect the appearance and local
impact of the structure;
7) modifications to be reversible where feasible;
8) where conservation is carried out, records kept of the work and any archaeological artefacts that
may be uncovered; and,
9) if deemed appropriate by the Overseeing Organisation, a long-term conservation management plan
drawn up for structures of conservation merit.
3.1.1
A historic environment assessment or investigation may be required prior to commencing the work.
3.1.2
Any structures built at least 75 years ago that are not listed or scheduled monuments, or within a
conservation area, that require maintenance to any external facing features, should be investigated with
findings documented to determine if the structure is of conservation merit using the following themes:
1) evidential value – there is evidence of value to the local community;
2) historical value – the structure has historical value in the local community;
3) aesthetic value – the structure has aesthetic value in terms of design, location or appearance;
4) communal value – the structure has links with the local communities in terms of commemorative,
symbolic, social or spiritual value.
3.1.3
Other younger structures may be included, where there is evidence to do so.
3.1.4
Decisions about structures of conservation merit should be based on discussions with local authority
archaeologists and conservation officers and local communities.
3.1.5
Any structures that are proposed as having conservation merit should be agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation and recorded in the asset information system.
Materials
3.2
The appropriate conservation techniques and use of materials shall be agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation before the application for consent is submitted for SMC or LBC as required.
3.3
Where materials are replaced, their positions in the structure and details of their source shall be
recorded in the maintenance manual in accordance with CG 302 [Ref 1.N] and in the Overseeing
Organisation's environmental database as set out in the National Application Annexes.
3.3.1
Traditional materials should be used, applied using traditional methods, unless they are no longer
permitted by health and safety regulations, or cause greater safety hazards to construction workers and
the public.
NOTE
For example, mortar joints are pointed in the original style and appearance etc.Traditional materials
such as masonry (brick, stone), lime mortar, timber, cast iron, wrought iron, can be obtained from
specialist suppliers.

3. Conservation strategies
3.3.2
Existing bridge furniture of historic and aesthetic value should be retained whenever possible.
3.3.3
Modern fixtures that are not in keeping with the age and type of structure should be assessed for
replacement at the next maintenance intervention, subject to approval by the Overseeing Organisation.
3.4
For materials used in the conservation of highway structures that require specialist contractors, those
employed shall have appropriate experience and skills.
3.4.1
Specialist suppliers and contractors should have knowledge of the composition, properties and correct
method of use of materials used in conservation.
NOTE
Reference can be made to the Conservation Accreditation Register for Engineers (CARE) formed
jointly by the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Structural Engineers.

4. Application of principles
4.
Application of principles
4.1
All structural modifications shall be subject to technical approval, refer CG 300 [Ref 3.N].
Strengthening
4.2
The design of a strengthening scheme shall be sympathetic to the historic context, originality of the
visible and unseen fabric, uniqueness of the structure and aesthetics.
NOTE
Where a structure requires strengthening, the choice of the strengthening method can depend on the
nature of the problem, construction material, design of the original structure, and requirements of
conservation.
4.2.1
The external appearance, particularly of parapets and edge beams of aesthetic significance, should not
be changed.
4.3
Early consultation with the relevant heritage or local planning authority (LPA) shall be undertaken.
4.4
Assessment of structures covered by the scope of this document shall be carried out in accordance with
current assessment documents and management strategy and scheme and operational requirements.
4.5
Urgent work on structures covered by the scope of this document shall be carried out;
1) where works are needed in the interests of health and safety or preservation of the structure; and,
2) where it is not practical to secure health and safety or the preservation of the structure by works of
repair or works affording temporary shelter or support.
4.6
Urgent work carried out on structures covered by the scope of this document shall be limited to the
minimum measures immediately necessary and designed to cause least permanent damage to the
fabric of the structure.
4.7
Methodology for undertaking urgent works shall be approved by the Overseeing Organisation and the
LPA.
Widening
4.8
Widening of a structure covered by the scope of this document shall be designed in accordance with
CD 367 [Ref 4.N].
4.9
The structure widening design shall be sympathetic to:
1) the setting, environment and historic context and character of the structure;
2) final appearance of the side elevation, parapet and visible deck construction; and,
3) appearance and balance of the approaches at road level.
4.9.1
Widening in the form of an adjacent structure should be designed to leave an uncluttered and clear
view of the original structure.
Change of use
4.10
When a structure requires a change of use involving higher loading, a structural assessment shall be
undertaken.
4.11
Where a structure is to be used to serve a lower volume of traffic, non-vehicular traffic, or becomes
redundant, it shall be maintained in a safe condition, posing no risk to users of the structure.
NOTE 1
This can be aided by designing alternative uses for the redundant bridge, for example, to carry a
bridleway or cycle track, or serve as part of a lay-by.
NOTE 2
Some sources of deterioration are liable to change, such as reduced salt spray, or increased vegetative
growth, which can be taken into account in the maintenance planning.
4.12
Where ownership is transferred from the Overseeing Organisation, the prospective owner shall be
advised of the heritage status of the structure.

Overseeing Organisation's environmental database as set out in the National Application Annexes.
Planning
5.2
Management planning shall be provided in accordance with principles of conservation.
NOTE
Drawings or surveys can be incorrect for historic bridges. Important details, such as earlier
strengthening measures or the presence of redundant structural elements, can be hidden within the
structure and not recorded.
5.3
For structures crossing watercourses the relevant river authority and environmental protection
organisation shall be consulted.
5.4
Potential reuse of materials shall be assessed.
5.4.1
Redundant materials that may be suitable for future maintenance of historic bridges should be
salvaged and stored where possible.

5.6
Routine or other minor preventative maintenance on scheduled and listed structures involving materials
or appearance shall be agreed with the relevant heritage authority prior to works.
5.7
Existing trees which are the subject of preservation orders shall be assessed as part of the
maintenance works undertaken.
5.8
Existing vegetation providing an established sight or noise screen shall be assessed as part of the
maintenance works undertaken and the existing effects maintained.
