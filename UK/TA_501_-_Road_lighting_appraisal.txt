Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the process for the appraisal of new and replacement road lighting for
motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. It specifically addresses the high level approach for lighting
requirements as well as the competencies of those involved in this area of the service.
The primary purpose of road lighting for motorways and all-purpose trunk roads is to reduce personal
injury collisions (PICs). This is a quantifiable benefit. Consequently the most important consideration is
the predicted accident cost saving, which should be greater than the lighting scheme cost in order to
provide economic justification for road lighting.
Other areas where road lighting may provide benefits, such as journey ambience, will often not be
quantifiable but should nevertheless be recorded and taken into account.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
This document is written for the competent lighting professional / practitioner and road safety engineer
with experience in the appraisal of road lighting schemes in order that a light appraisal is undertaken
that is suitable for motorway and all-purpose trunk roads.
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 1.N].

Determine works and operating costs
5.1
The costs of road lighting shall be determined and recorded separately as the works cost and operating
costs for the proposed scheme.
Works costs
5.2
The works cost shall include all the costs that are incurred by preparing and installing the proposed
scheme, including any overhead costs such as preparation, design and site supervision that are not
accounted for automatically within the appraisal process.
NOTE
Appendix A provides a non-exhaustive list of items to be included in the works costs.
5.3
Where other construction work is taking place at the same time, the works cost shall be the additional
cost to the scheme of installing lighting rather than the cost of lighting in isolation.
NOTE
Where road lighting maintenance is included with other maintenance activities, the cost of traffic
management is not solely allocated to lighting.
Operating costs
5.4
The operating costs shall include the annual maintenance over the life of the installation, energy
charges over the life of the installation and the decommissioning and disposal at end-of-life.
Maintenance cost
5.5

Road safety engineer report
6.1
A full accident analysis and evaluation of the scheme shall be undertaken by a road safety engineer
and a report produced detailing any findings and recommendations.
NOTE
This assessment is supplementary to road safety audits carried out for all highways improvement
schemes GG 119 [Ref 1.I].
Determination of personal injury collision (PIC) savings
6.2
The road safety engineer shall determine the percentage darkness personal injury collision (PIC)
savings due to road lighting for the type of road, based on the most recent national statistics detailed
within the RCGB [Ref 2.N].
6.3
The resultant percentage darkness PIC savings shall be used by the road safety engineer to determine
the estimated darkness PIC savings for the opening year of the scheme to be applied within the SAR
for each link.
6.4
Where road lighting forms part of a package of improvements to an existing road, the road safety
engineer shall determine the applicable PIC saving due to road lighting.
6.5
PIC savings shall be assessed over the same geographical extent as the proposed lighting scheme.
Darkness PIC saving on a new link / junction
6.6
The forecast number of darkness PICs for the opening year shall be determined from the predicted
opening year traffic flow multiplied by the national average PIC rate for the type of road.
6.7
The predicted PIC saving shall be calculated by multiplying the number of opening year darkness PICs
by the appropriate percentage determined by the road safety engineer.
Darkness PIC saving on an existing unlit link / junction
6.8
The forecast number of darkness PICs for the opening year shall be taken to be the same as the
average for the immediately preceding five years.
6.9
In the absence of five years' data, the minimum period to be assessed for the number of darkness PICs
shall be three years.
6.10
The PICs shall be rationalised to exclude any where DGN was a significant contributory factor.
6.11
The predicted PIC saving shall be calculated by multiplying the number of opening year darkness PICs
by the appropriate percentage determined by the road safety engineer.
Darkness PIC saving for renewing lighting on a lit link / junction
6.12
The forecast number of darkness PICs for the opening year shall be taken to be the same as the
average for the immediately preceding five years, assuming road lighting remains in place.
6.13
In the absence of five years' data, the minimum period to be assessed for the number of darkness PICs
shall be three years.
6.14
The PICs shall be rationalised to exclude any where DGN was a significant contributory factor.
6.15
The predicted PIC saving shall be calculated by multiplying the number of opening year darkness PICs
by Equation 6.15, where A is the appropriate percentage determined by the road safety engineer.
Equation 6.15 (Predicted PIC Savings)

Appendix B. Energy cost calculation
Appendix B. Energy cost calculation
The cost of energy should be included in the opening year maintenance cost. In order to correctly allow
for inflation in energy prices, it should first be factored as described below.
The whole life maintenance cost element of the present value of costs (PVC) is calculated by SAR as
follows:
PVC(maintenance) = OYMC × CF × DF × GTF
where:
OYMC is the opening year maintenance cost;
CF is the capitalisation factor for maintenance for the appraisal period;
DF is the discount factor to base year 2010; and
GTF is the general taxation factor.
The energy cost (EC) should be evaluated to the same year as the OYMC. As energy prices can be
volatile, this evaluation year should be as close as possible to the opening year and an informed
estimate should be made of the likely energy cost in that year. Reference to government official
statistics on energy prices may provide assistance.
It is necessary to calculate another capitalisation factor, CF(energy), using the formula:
CF(energy) = (1 – Xa+1) / (1 – X)
where:
X = {1 + (e/100)} / {1 + (d/100)}
a = appraisal period in years;
e = the energy inflation rate above RPI in %; and
d = the discount rate in %.
The EC is factored for inclusion in the total OYMC as follows:
OYMC(energy component) = EC (CF(energy) / CF).
The appropriate values for d and CF should be confirmed with the Overseeing Organisation. The value
for e should be 10% unless otherwise directed by the Overseeing Organisation.

Appendix C. Decommissioning cost calculation
Appendix C. Decommissioning cost calculation
The decommissioning cost should be kept separate from the construction cost in order to retain the
integrity of other calculations within the lighting appraisal. For this reason, it should be added to the
opening year maintenance cost, after factoring to give the correct result.
The whole life maintenance cost element of the present value of costs (PVC) is calculated as follows:
PVC(maintenance) = OYMC × CF× DF × GTF
where:
OYMC is the opening year maintenance cost;
CF is the capitalisation factor for maintenance for the appraisal period;
DF is the discount factor to base year 2010; and
GTF is the general taxation factor.
The decommissioning cost (DC) should be evaluated to the same year as the OYMC. It should then be
factored for inclusion in the OYMC as follows:
OYMC(decommissioning component) = DC / CF.
The appropriate value for CF should be confirmed with the Overseeing Organisation.

Appendix E. Guidance to the assessment of non-quantifiable impacts
E1
Landscape, townscape, heritage and biodiversity
A formalised impact assessment is required for each of these topics.
E2
Promote active transport
This refers to the encouragement of walking and cycling activities. Where the road to be lit has
provision for walking and/or cycling an estimate should be made of the likely increase in walking and
cycling journeys after dark resulting from lighting.
E3
Journey ambience
A journey in darkness may be less stressful if the road is lit and a comment to this effect should be
made. However, in the daytime the presence of lighting columns can detract from views of the
surrounding area if the landscape is of reasonable quality.
E4
Accidents
Refer to section 6.
E5
Security
Road lighting will generally make little difference to the security of road users and should normally be
assessed as having a neutral impact.
E6
Severance
In situations where a road passes through a settlement, road lighting can be very beneficial after dark.
It can restore the connection between the two sides visually and it can encourage the movement of
inhabitants from one side to the other. However, this should not be considered without public
consultation as alternatives to road lighting may be preferred.
E7
Government policy
All impacts on Government policy should be reported. For example, road lighting would contribute to
meeting casualty reduction targets. On the other hand, road lighting would consume energy, thus
working against the Government's long-term strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other
policies where road lighting would have a non-neutral impact should also be mentioned.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex contains the Highways England specific requirements related to the
appraisal of road lighting removal.
Road lighting is required to be regularly assessed to determine if it remains cost effective. This
document outlines the actions to be undertaken by service providers to select, assess, and implement
the removal of road lighting.
Motorways and all-purpose trunk roads are normally only provided with lighting when there are positive
road safety benefits to the community that offset the cost to the public purse and the environmental
impacts. The requirement for lighting is assessed using the requirements in TA 501 which takes
account of the whole life costs of a proposed lighting scheme and its environmental impact set against
the resultant saving in personal injury collisions.
Highways England is committed to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions (CO2) of its
roadside equipment, without a discernible shift in safety or customer service. Any decision to remove
existing road lighting requires scheme appraisal that is not currently covered by any other issued
requirements and advice.
TA 501 is to be used in conjunction with this document. The requirements in this document are
supplementary to TA 501 and allow the assessment of benefits that an existing scheme is providing
against the running costs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Appendix E/A. Decision making scope of assessment
Appendix E/A. Decision making scope of assessment
The scope of assessment for decision making when determining whether to approve removal of an
existing road lighting scheme should include, but is not limited to, the following questions:
E/A1
Is this an appropriate site for this intervention?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, are there other sites in
the region that could be considered significantly more appropriate?
Based on qualitative information provided by front-line staff and road safety engineers, are there any
issues which could discount implementation at this site?
E/A2
Is this site providing a cost effective service?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, is this site providing a
BCR >=1?
Based on qualitative information provided by front-line staff and road safety engineers, would the
removal of road lighting discernibly increase exposure of the workforce and customers to risk?
E/A3
Does a comparison of costs and effect on safety indicate the removal of road
lighting is reasonably practicable and acceptable to stakeholders?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, is the projected BCR of
the existing road lighting scheme for the remainder of its anticipated 25 year lifespan acceptable?

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex contains the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland specific
requirements related to the appraisal of road lighting removal.
Road lighting is required to be regularly assessed to determine if it remains cost effective. This
document outlines the actions to be undertaken by service providers to select, assess, and implement
the removal of road lighting.
Motorways and all-purpose trunk roads are normally only provided with lighting when there are positive
road safety benefits to the community that offset the cost to the public purse and the environmental
impacts. The requirement for lighting is assessed using the requirements in TA 501 which takes
account of the whole life costs of a proposed lighting scheme and its environmental impact set against
the resultant saving in personal injury collisions.
Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland is committed to reduce the energy consumption and
carbon emissions (CO2) of its roadside equipment, without a discernible shift in safety or customer
service. Any decision to remove existing road lighting requires scheme appraisal that is not currently
covered by any other issued requirements and advice.
TA 501 is to be used in conjunction with this document. The requirements in this document are
supplementary to TA 501 and allow the assessment of benefits that an existing scheme is providing
against the running costs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Appendix NI/A. Decision making scope of assessment
Appendix NI/A. Decision making scope of assessment
The scope of assessment for decision making when determining whether to approve removal of an
existing road lighting scheme should include, but is not limited to, the following questions:
NI/A1
Is this an appropriate site for this intervention?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, are there other sites in
the region that could be considered significantly more appropriate?
Based on qualitative information provided by front-line staff and road safety engineers, are there any
issues which could discount implementation at this site?
NI/A2
Is this site providing a cost effective service?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, is this site providing a
BCR >=1?
Based on qualitative information provided by front-line staff and road safety engineers, would the
removal of road lighting discernibly increase exposure of the workforce and customers to risk?
NI/A3
Does a comparison of costs and effect on safety indicate the removal of road
lighting is reasonably practicable and acceptable to stakeholders?
Based on quantitative information provided by collision and running cost data, is the projected BCR of
the existing road lighting scheme for the remainder of its anticipated 25 year lifespan acceptable?
Is there any evidence to suggest that removal of the road lighting scheme will result in a discernible
shift in risk between road user and road worker or from one road user type to another? Consideration
should be given to operating, roadwork and incident scenarios.
NI/A4
Can the benefits be realised?
Are the implementation costs reasonable and affordable?
What are the 5 most likely foreseeable risks and are they currently effectively managed?
NI/A5
Are there any other factors that should be taken into account and are relevant
to the decision making scope of assessment?
