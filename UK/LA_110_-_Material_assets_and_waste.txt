Introduction
Introduction
Background
The construction, improvement and maintenance of motorways and all purpose trunk roads can result
in environmental effects associated with the consumption and use of material assets, and the disposal /
recovery of waste.
Environmental assessment provides a framework for assessing and managing the effects associated
with the use of material assets and disposal / recovery of waste by promoting;
1) reduction in overall impacts and improvements in the efficiency of resource use; and
2) prevention and / or reduction of the adverse effects associated with the generation and management
of waste.
This document aligns with Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU [Ref 3.N] as well as the
requirements of the Waste Directive [Ref 2.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] apply to this document.

2. Principles and purpose
2.
Principles and purpose
Integration with consent procedures and planning policy
2.1
The environmental assessment of material assets and waste must in accordance with the requirements
of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] include:
1) a description of the project (including quantities and types of waste produced during the construction
and operation phases);
2) a description of the likely significant effects of the project on the environment (including the disposal
and recovery of waste);
3) the direct and indirect significant effects of a project (on material assets); and
4) the interaction (of material assets) with other factors.
Assessment and consultation
2.2
The environmental assessment and subsequent management of material assets and waste shall apply
the following waste management hierarchy from the Waste Directive [Ref 2.N], in descending order of
preference:
1) prevention (no waste produced);
2) preparing for re-use;
3) recycling;
4) other recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and
5) disposal.
2.3
When applying the waste hierarchy, measures shall be implemented to encourage the options that
deliver compliance with the Waste Directive [Ref 2.N] and best overall environmental outcome.
NOTE
Application of the waste hierarchy can require specific waste streams departing from the hierarchy
where this:
1) is justified by life-cycle thinking; and
2) delivers the best overall environmental outcome.
2.4
The environmental assessment of material assets and waste shall, in accordance with the Waste
Directive, adopt the following:
1) principles of precaution and sustainability;
2) technical feasibility and economic viability;
3) protection of resources; and
4) waste to be disposed of or recovered in one of the nearest appropriate installations (proximity
principle).
2.5
The principles of the EC circular economy package EC EEP [Ref 1.N] shall be applied where relevant
during assessment and reporting.
2.6
Where potential trans-boundary impacts are predicted, projects shall consult with the relevant planning
authorities likely to be concerned.

3. Assessment methodology
3.
Assessment methodology
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall document the initial baseline studies undertaken and make a
recommendation on the scope of further assessment.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall address the following questions to gain an understanding of the need to
undertake further assessment:
1) is the project likely to recover/reuse little on site material thereby requiring materials to be imported
to site?;
2) is the project likely to use little/no recycled/secondary materials thereby requiring the majority of
materials used on the project to comprise primary materials?;
3) the project is likely to sterilise (substantially constrain/prevent existing and potential future use of)
mineral sites or peat resources?;
4) would the project generate large quantities of waste relative to regional landfill capacity?;
5) will the project have an effect on the ability of waste infrastructure within the region to continue to
accommodate waste from other sources?
3.2.1
Consistent units of measurement, either volume or weight, should be used in the scoping assessment.
3.2.2
Where projects are in an early stage of development, assumptions and limitations on data gaps should
be reported.
3.3
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
NOTE
Scoping assessments can conclude that either of the two elements (materials assets or waste) is
outside of the scope of any further assessment.
3.4
Scoping shall apply established and reliable design, mitigation and best practice measures when
reporting against the above points.
Study area(s)
3.5
Where the need for further assessment has been established, two geographically different study areas
shall be defined.
3.6
The first study area shall be based on the construction footprint/project boundary (including compounds
and temporary land take).
3.7
The second study area shall include waste infrastructure that is suitable (licensed for waste volume and
type) to accept arisings and or waste generated by the project.
3.7.1
A balance of the proximity principle and value for money should be applied in establishing the second
study area.
3.8
The study area(s) used in the assessment shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
Baseline scenario
3.9
Where the need for further assessment has been established, for the first study area, the assessment
shall describe the current and likely future state (in the absence of the project) of the following:
1) the types and quantity of material use associated with operation of the existing road / site;
2) the types and quantities of waste produced associated with operation of the existing road / site;
3) information on availability of key construction materials required for the project.
3.10
Where the need for further assessment has been established, for the second study area, the
assessment shall describe the current and likely future state (in the absence of the project) of the
following:

by the project;
2) regional (or other relevant geographic scale) presence and capacity of material recovery / recycling
facilities to be utilised by the project;
3) location of mineral sites and peat resources in relation to the project.
Data collection
3.11
Where the need for further assessment has been established, the following shall be identified for
material assets:
1) types and quantities of materials required to construct the project;
2) information on materials that contain secondary / recycled content;
3) information on any known sustainability credentials of materials to be consumed;
4) the type and volume of materials that will be recovered from off site sources for use on the project;
5) the cut and fill balance;
6) details of on-site storage and stockpiling arrangements, and any supporting logistical details.
3.12
For waste the assessment shall identify the following;
1) the amount of waste (by weight) that will be recovered and diverted from landfill either on site or off
site (i.e. for use on other projects);

LA 110 Revision 0
3. Assessment methodology
3.18.1
The evidence should include (list not exhaustive) [Ref 2.I];
1) design for reuse and recovery: identifying, securing and using materials that already exist on site, or
can be sourced from other projects;
2) design for materials optimisation: simplifying layout and form to minimise material use, using
standard design parameters, balancing cut and fill, maximising the use of renewable materials and
materials with recycled content;
3) design for off site construction: maximising the use of pre-fabricated structure and components,
encouraging a process of assembly rather than construction;
4) design for the future (deconstruction and flexibility): identify how materials can be designed to be
more easily adapted over an asset lifetime and how deconstructability and demountability of
elements can be maximised at end of first life;
5) design for waste efficient procurement: identify and specify materials that can be acquired
responsibility, in accordance with a recognised industry standard; and
6) engineering plan configurations and layouts that show how the most effective use of materials and
arisings can be achieved.
3.19
The environmental assessment shall evidence the adoption of design and mitigation measures for
waste.
3.19.1
The evidence should include (list not exhaustive);
1) engage early with contractors during design to identify possible mitigation and enhancement
measures, and to identify opportunities to reduce waste;
2) ensuring arisings generated are handled, stored, managed and re-used or recycled as close as
possible to the point of origin;
3) identify areas for stockpiling and storing arisings that will minimise degradation, damage and loss;
4) capture information and data on site arisings recovered / diverted from landfill and waste sent to
landfill as part of a 'live' Environmental Management Plan (EMP); and
5) specify management requirements for construction materials, site arisings and waste in a 'live' EMP.
Environmental enhancement
3.20
Enhancement opportunities shall be identified, reported and implemented within the environmental
assessment and subsequent stages of the project life cycle.
NOTE
Example enhancement opportunities for material assets and waste include:
1) use of surplus recycled or recovered materials in community projects e.g, utilising recycled mulch
from tree felling on adjacent community facilities; or
2) recycling suitable material for construction of noise and landscape bunding outside of the highway
boundary where need has been previously identified (where land availability allows) to improve
environmental outcomes for a wider range of receptors.
Reporting of environmental assessments
3.21
The environmental assessment for material assets and waste shall report on the construction phase
and first year of operational activities (opening year).

4. Monitoring
4.
Monitoring
4.1
The EMP shall be reviewed and updated to report on monitoring of:
1) construction monitoring data on site arisings and waste generated and assumptions on site arisings
and waste forecast used in the assessment;
2) equivalent data for comparison with the assessment forecast during the first year of operation; and
3) recording/reporting to ensure all legal documentation (waste carrier registration, landfill licence,
waste transfer documentation) associated with the management of construction and operational
materials, site arisings and waste is available and retained.
