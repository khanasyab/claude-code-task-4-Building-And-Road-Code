Introduction
Introduction
Background
By virtue of the Infrastructure Act 2015 ( Act 2015 c.7 [Ref 4.N]), the Traffic Management Act 2004 ( Act
2004 c.18 [Ref 9.N]) was revised to include Highways England as a traffic authority. As such, Highways
England is legally obligated to facilitate the expeditious movement of traffic both on our own network
and on the network of other traffic authorities. Consequently, this changes our legal position in terms of
diversion routes; with fit for purpose diversion routes being central, not only to meeting this obligation,
but to providing our customers with a continuous journey during closures of the motorway and all
purpose trunk road network, which ultimately supports our statutory Highways England Licence [Ref
3.N] requirement to proactively minimise disruption.
Highways England's licence stipulates that Highways England should:
1) seek to minimise disruption to road users that might reasonably be expected to occur as a result of:
a) planned disruption to the network (including from road works);
b) unplanned disruption to the network (including from incidents on the network and the short-term
effects of extreme weather conditions).
2) proactively and re-actively provide relevant, accurate and timely information about traffic and
conditions on the network to road users, including when there is disruption.
Highways England has therefore developed requirements for diversion routes for unplanned events in
order to build customer trust in diversion routes and show our customers that we care.
The objective of this document is to ensure the safe transportation of motorway and all purpose trunk
road network traffic around an unplanned closure, and to proactively seek to minimise the disruption to
our customers and communities.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Appendix E/A. Guidance for the review and inspection of diversion routes
for unplanned events
E/A1
Methodology for inspecting diversion routes for unplanned events (DRUEs)
E/A1.1
Stage 1: audit of diversion routes for unplanned events
Regional directors will have ownership of how both DRUE inspections and a programme of work to
improve DRUEs are carried out.
Through relevant delegation, they will ensure required access to DRUE data for their region.
They will identify the priorities for inspecting DRUEs, e.g. in terms of route- based strategies, local
highway authority feedback and known issues: customer and political. These priorities will determine
which DRUEs are to be discussed at stage 2.
E/A1.2
Stage 2: workshop inspections
Workshops will take place before any on road inspections.
Desk-based workshops will be arranged and chaired by delegation of the Regional Director.
The number of workshops required within each region will be dependent on the grouping of DRUEs,
based on local geographical demographics (authorities can be combined).
A desktop review of the DRUE will be carried out; assessing the DRUE against the general
requirements of this standard.
The workshop inspection help sheet (see E/A1.2.3) and the workshop inspection guidance (see Table
E/A.1) can be used in addition to the general requirements of this standard, to support workshop
inspections.
Workshop notes will be recorded as per E/A1.2.4.
DRUE data from workshop inspections will be collated and analysed in the template for diversion
routes for unplanned events inspection data (see E/A2). If a DRUE is used in both directions, the
diversion route data for each direction will be recorded separately for ease of analysis.
It is recommended that these workshops take place at a frequency which will enable regions to inspect
20% of the DRUEs annually.
E/A1.2.1
Workshop requirements
All attendees will receive a copy of the DRUEs to be discussed and the general requirements of this
document at least two weeks prior to the workshop.
All attendees will be required to review the DRUEs and this customer service standard prior to the
workshop, so that they have any necessary material to provide input.
E/A1.2.2
Workshop purpose and objectives
The purpose of the workshop is to establish if the existing DRUEs remain the best route for diverting
motorway and all purpose trunk road network traffic.
The objectives of the workshop are to:
1) assess prioritised DRUEs within the 'local highway authority area' against this document;
2) identify any DRUEs that need improving, based on the requirements of this document; and,
3) prioritise DRUEs that will require on road inspections based on the outcomes of the workshops.
E/A1.2.3
Workshop inspection help sheet
During the workshop, the following questions need to be answered:
1) Has the DRUE been inspected within the last 12 months?

the diversion signage along the diversion route?
3) Are there any height, weight or width restrictions that would prevent motorway and all purpose trunk
road network traffic from using the DRUE?
4) Do we need to change the DRUE?
5) Can the DRUE be used in both directions at the same time, for all motorway and all purpose trunk
road network traffic, except abnormal loads?
6) Are any mitigating actions required to implement the DRUE?
7) Is a contingency diversion route required for certain situations or times of the year?

DRUE requirements
Guidance
Has the DRUE been inspected within the last 12 months?
DRUEs inspected within the last 12 months do not need
to be discussed or inspected.
Does the DRUE need to be prioritised for an on road
inspection because there are concerns about the
diversion signage along the route?
Diversion signage
1. DRUEs will need to be prioritised for on road inspection
if there are concerns with the diversion signage.
2. You may want to prioritise DRUEs for on road
inspection where the existing DRUE already splits HGV
traffic from light vehicles or if you have concerns that the
same diversion symbol is used for nearby DRUE(s).
Are there any height, weight or width restrictions that
would prevent motorway and all purpose trunk road
network traffic from using the DRUE?
Physical attributes
Do we need to change the DRUE, or will we have a
separate DRUE for HGVs?
Can the DRUE be used in both directions at the same
time, for all motorway and all purpose trunk road network
traffic, except abnormal loads?
Physical attributes
Establish if there is any risk to HGVs passing each other
along the diversion route; considering traffic calming, on
street parking and tight bends.
Examples of potential mitigating actions:
1) The use of traffic signals at either end of an 'S' bend to
allow HGVs to use the other lane rather than
mounting the pavement to make the turn.
2) A secondary route.
3) An operational variable signs and signals plan to
strategically divert traffic should the section of the
motorway and all purpose trunk road network be
closed in both directions.
Do we need to change the DRUE?

Guidance
Are any mitigating actions required to implement the
DRUE?
1. welfare facilities
2. number of local communities
impacted
3. junction types
4. local traffic generators
5. roadside hazards
6. severe weather
1. The needs of our vulnerable road users become acute
quickly during unplanned closures of the motorway and all
purpose trunk road network.
2. A number of our customers plan their journeys around
rest areas; we need to be able to provide an alternative.
3. Does the DRUE pass through small local
communities? Are houses located directly on the
roadside, with no pavement?
Mitigating actions could include:
1) An operational plan to inform schools, hospitals and
care homes of a closure of the motorway and all
purpose trunk road network and the subsequent use
of the DRUE.
2) A communications plan, to be activated when the
DRUE is required, for residents and businesses, like
freight distribution centres, along the diversion route.
3) Operational variable signs and signal plans to
strategically divert drivers during severe weather.
4) Having a remote system in place to be able to refine
the traffic signals to prioritise the traffic flow of the
diversion route, to reduce HGV braking and

Workshop inspection objective
DRUE requirements
Guidance
Is a contingency diversion route required for certain
situations or times of the year?
1. permitted hours of use
2. prohibited traffic and
non-motorised users
3. major organised events
1. We need to ensure that we do not direct prohibited
traffic onto the motorway network, that we do not
encourage illegal manoeuvres for learner drivers and
tractors.
2. Think about pedestrian crossings, particularly outside
schools: the guidance states that all school crossings
should have traffic signals. Is it an issue if there are not
traffic signals? Would engagement with the school be
sufficient?
3. Think about any cyclists that you are diverting and the
regular existence of cyclists on the DRUE and any risks
associated with the increase in traffic.
4. We need to record if a contingency diversion route
needs to be identified and agreed as part of the planning
for a major organised event.

E/A1.2.4
Record of workshop inspection
A record of the decisions and actions from the workshop inspection will be kept, and approval of these
workshop minutes will be required from all attendees.
The record of the workshop inspection for each DRUE will include the following diversion route details:
1) area team;
2) road (SRN);
3) diversion route identification number (RIN);
4) diversion route card number (if different to RIN);
5) section of SRN (e.g. Jx to Jx);
6) area location (if required);
7) Is the diversion route used in both directions?;
8) direction of travel;
9) local highway authorities impacted by the use of the diversion route;
10) police; and,
11) diversion route symbol.
It will also detail the following in terms of the DRUE requirements:
1) the location and detail, if known, of any diversion signage concerns;
2) the location and detail, if known, of any HGV restrictions, including any concerns;
3) the length and travel time of both the diversion route and the relevant section of the motorway and
all purpose trunk road network;
4) any restrictions, in terms of time, with the use of the diversion route;
5) any service areas impacted by a closure of the motorway and all purpose trunk road network, and
the location of welfare facilities on the diversion route;
6) any tolls that you are diverting from and to;
7) where a diversion route diverts APTR traffic onto a motorway;
8) where the diversion route is part of the national cycle network;
9) the location and detail of any risks for non-motorised users along the diversion route, for example, a
concern about the lack of a pavement for pedestrians;
10) the location and detail of any roadside hazards;
11) where the diversion route is prone to flooding or other severe weather; and,
12) any known annual major organised event(s) that impact the diversion route, and if we need to
consider a contingency diversion route for such events during the planning of the event.
In terms of decisions and actions, the record of the workshop inspection will detail:
1) the diversion routes which have been prioritised for on road inspection;
2) the diversion routes which need to be changed, and the potential new route, if known;
3) where a secondary or contingency diversion route is required, and if known, what this alternative
diversion route will be;
4) the diversion routes which require a further review to establish mitigating actions;
5) for specific diversion routes, any required engagement or other mitigating actions that need to be
established to implement the diversion route; and,
6) any administration requirements, such as reviewing a traffic regulation order or updating a diversion
route card.

Stage 3: on road inspections
A drive through of prioritised DRUEs will be carried out by the service provider or regional operations. If
the DRUE is used in both directions, the DRUE will need to be driven in both directions and data
collected separately.
An example of an on road inspection data checklist is provided in Table E/A.2, to support the
assessment of each DRUE against the following requirements of this standard:
1) Signage: inspecting diversion signage against the standard and validating any height or weight
restrictions.
2) Inspecting pavement condition against the standard.
DRUE data from on road inspections will be collated and analysed in the template for diversion routes
for unplanned events inspection data (see E/A2).
It is recommended that each region drives 20% of their DRUEs each year.
