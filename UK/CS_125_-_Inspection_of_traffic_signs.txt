CS 125 Revision 2
Introduction
Introduction
Background
Requirements and advice for the inspection, maintenance and disposal of traffic signs are defined in
this document, CM 125 [Ref 4.N] and CZ 125 [Ref 1.N].
Traffic signs facilitate the safe use and effective operation of the highway by communicating directions,
warnings, regulations and other information to road users. Inspection, maintenance and disposal of
traffic signs are necessary because:
1) traffic signs are subject to legislation and their legal status, or that of an associated statutory
provision, can be affected if there is a failure in the performance of a traffic sign or associated
equipment;
2) over-provision of traffic signs can have a negative visual impact on the environment and can have a
detrimental impact on comprehension by road users where there is an overload of information;
3) the visual performance of traffic signs reduces during the hours of darkness and degrades over time,
reducing conspicuity and legibility;
4) impairment of the visibility and legibility of traffic signs can be detrimental to road safety by
distracting road users and/or hindering drivers' uptake of vital information;
5) deterioration of supporting structures and electrical installations can occur, potentially becoming
hazardous to road users, road workers and/or other parties;
6) rectification of defects and preventive maintenance are key to a traffic sign installation achieving its
design life.
Further guidance on the reasons for inspecting, maintaining and disposing of traffic signs can be found
in sections 8 and 9 of TSM Chapter 1 [Ref 8.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

CS 125 Revision 2
2. Inspection
2.
Inspection
General
2.1
The following elements shall be assessed as part of the inspection of traffic signs:
1) visual performance;
2) structural integrity;
3) electrical safety;
4) the need for removal or replacement.
NOTE
The inspection of each traffic sign installation is necessary to:
1) identify defects which can affect safety or operational performance;
2) determine the overall condition of the asset;
3) gather intelligence for use in determining the frequency of subsequent inspections.
Frequency of inspections
2.2
Inspections of each traffic sign shall be undertaken periodically under both daytime and night-time
conditions so that the requirements of this section can be met.
2.3
The frequency and timing of the inspection of each traffic sign shall be determined by means of a risk
assessment.
2.3.1
Factors to be assessed in the risk assessment should include:
1) whether the traffic sign is essential for safety (e.g. a warning traffic sign) or is necessary for the
enforcement of a statutory provision;
2) whether the traffic sign is to be illuminated by a means of internal or external lighting during the
hours of darkness to comply with TSRGD [Ref 7.N] or for night-time visibility;
3) the interval since the previous inspection;
4) the status and condition of the components of each traffic sign asset, as recorded at the previous
inspection;
5) the extent to which a traffic sign installation is exposed to adverse weather conditions such as strong
winds;
6) the proximity of vegetation which can obscure the visibility of a traffic sign and/or affect the rate at
which dirt or vegetation builds-up on the traffic sign face;
7) seasonal growth in vegetation which can obscure the visibility of a traffic sign;
8) the proximity of the carriageway, which can affect the rate at which dirt builds up.
2.3.2
The inspection regime may comprise a combination of on-site inspections, routine patrols, and mobile
inspections using automated asset data collection technologies.
2.3.3
The duration between inspections of each traffic sign should be no greater than two years.
Competency of inspectors
2.4
Inspectors of traffic signs shall be competent in both the application of this document and the key
factors which affect achievement of the requirements.
Visual performance
2.5
Inspection of each traffic sign shall determine whether there are any defects or failures which are
preventing:

2. Inspection
1) the minimum clear visibility distance for the type of traffic sign from being achieved when assessed
under both daytime and night-time conditions in accordance with the relevant value given in Table
2.5;
2) all elements of the traffic sign from being legible when assessed under both daytime and night-time
conditions;
3) illumination of the traffic sign where required by TSRGD [Ref 7.N];
4) all traffic sign lighting units (where provided) from:
a) functioning;
b) operating during the hours of darkness only;
c) being correctly aligned towards the traffic sign face.

Warning traffic signs
Appendix A of TSM Chapter 4 [Ref 10.N]
2.6
Assessments of the minimum clear visibility distance and the legibility of a traffic sign shall identify all
defects arising from:
1) obscuration or obstruction caused by dirt, graffiti, posters, vegetation or other traffic signs, street
furniture or structures;
2) loss, damage or fading of traffic sign face material;
3) degradation in retroreflectivity or variances in retroreflectivity where a part of a traffic sign has been
replaced;
4) incorrect placement, mounting height or orientation of traffic signs relative to users;
5) incorrect vertical or horizontal alignment of the panels of a traffic sign;
6) a failure of internal or external illumination under night-time conditions;
7) a failure of the structure supporting a traffic sign.
2.6.1
The assessment of minimum clear visibility distance may be undertaken by estimating the minimum
clear visibility distance achieved from a moving vehicle which is travelling at the prevailing traffic speed.
2.6.2
Where the minimum clear visibility distance to a traffic sign cannot be estimated or particular defects
affecting visibility cannot be identified from a moving vehicle, the assessment should be made during a
visit to the traffic sign installation.
2.6.3
Where a traffic sign is mounted on the nearside of the road, the minimum clear visibility distance should
be assessed to or from the centre of the nearest lane.
2.6.4
Where a traffic sign is mounted on the offside of the road, the minimum clear visibility distance should
be assessed to or from the centre of the closest lane to which the traffic sign relates.
2.6.5
The assessment of legibility should replicate a road user travelling towards and reading a traffic sign
from the closest lane to which the traffic sign relates.
2.6.6
The assessment of legibility should begin from the relevant minimum clear visibility distance for the
type of traffic sign, which can be identified from Table 2.5, and continue to the point at which it is no
longer realistic for a driver to continue reading the traffic sign.
2.6.7
An evaluation of the extent to which colours have faded and there has been loss or damage to the
legend should be included in the assessment of legibility.
NOTE 1
Any fading, loss or damage can significantly affect the contrast between different elements of the traffic
sign, and hence its legibility.

2. Inspection
NOTE 2
The effects of fading, loss or damage can have a more significant impact on the legibility of a traffic sign
under night-time conditions.
2.6.8
Where degradation in the retroreflective performance of a traffic sign or a part of a traffic sign is
suspected, the extent of the problem and the need for intervention should be ascertained by measuring
the coefficient of retroreflection.
NOTE
Appendix A provides advice on measuring the coefficient of retroreflection.
2.6.9
Where the positioning of a traffic sign in relation to the carriageway is suspected of compromising
legibility, the extent of the problem and the need for intervention should be ascertained by reference to
TSM Chapter 1 [Ref 8.N], which contains guidance on the correct placement, mounting height and
orientation of traffic signs in relation to the carriageway.
Structural integrity
2.7
Inspection of each structure supporting a traffic sign shall determine whether the structure has any
defect or failure which is:
1) presenting or can present a safety hazard to road users, road workers or other parties;
2) affecting or can affect the service life of the structure.
2.8
Inspections shall include a check of whether all structural elements, fixtures and fittings are present,
serviceable and securely attached in accordance with the manufacturer's installation and maintenance
instructions.
2.9
Where a structural element, fixture or fitting is not present, not serviceable or not securely attached in
accordance with the manufacturer's installation and maintenance instructions, a defect shall be
identified.
NOTE 1
Appendix D illustrates the key structural elements, fixtures and fittings typically required for a
post-mounted traffic sign installation.
NOTE 2
Common sources of failure in supporting structures can include:
1) insufficient foundations, demonstrated by excessive movement in the structure or the surrounding
ground;
2) corrosion of traffic sign posts or extension posts owing to damage, loss of material (concrete posts)
or failure of protective measures;
3) cracking, buckling or leaning of passively safe traffic sign posts;
4) missing or insecure clips, bands, bolts, washers or nuts;
5) damaged channels, potentially caused by over-tightening of bands or the nuts for clips, or the
absence of washers;
6) missing or insecure panel butting clamps/plates or joints at the interfaces between panels;
7) missing post caps, leading to a build-up of moisture and corrosion within the post;
8) missing or unsecured doors to recesses; and
9) seized door locks.
Electrical safety
2.10
Inspection of each electrical installation which forms part of a traffic sign installation shall determine
whether the electrical installation has any defect or failure which is presenting or can present a safety
hazard to road users, road workers or other parties.
2.11
Inspection and testing of electrical installations shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements
and recommendations of BS 7671 [Ref 5.N].

CS 125 Revision 2
2. Inspection
The need for removal or replacement of traffic signs and associated equipment
2.12
The need for the removal or replacement of traffic signs and associated equipment shall be identified
during inspections.
NOTE 1
Factors leading to removal or replacement of a traffic sign or traffic sign infrastructure can include:
1) loss, damage or fading of traffic sign face material so that the traffic sign is no longer legible;
2) degradation in retroreflective performance so that coefficient of retroreflection measurements are
below the intervention levels given in Appendix C;
3) an irreparable structural defect;
4) theft of key components;
5) installations, such as traffic sign posts, become disassociated with a traffic sign and present:
a) a hazard to road users, road workers or other parties;
b) an unlawful obstruction of the highway.
NOTE 2
A traffic sign can be obsolete or become obsolete if, for example:
1) there is no longer a clear need for the traffic sign or the information on the traffic sign is incorrect;
2) the traffic sign is no longer prescribed in TSRGD [Ref 7.N];
3) the traffic sign is not prescribed in TSRGD [Ref 7.N] and has not been specially authorised by the
relevant Secretary of State;
4) the traffic sign does not align with the terms of the statutory provision, which has caused it to be
placed on the highway;
5) it is a temporary traffic sign, subject to removal in the timescales given in TSRGD [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 3
The ongoing legitimacy of some traffic signs is subject to the timescales given in TSRGD [Ref 7.N].
Appendix G provides examples of such traffic signs.
NOTE 4
CZ 125 [Ref 1.N] defines the requirements for the disposal of traffic signs and is applicable once the
need for the removal or replacement of a traffic sign or associated equipment has been identified.

Appendix A. Measuring the coefficient of retroreflection
Appendix A. Measuring the coefficient of retroreflection
The coefficient of retroreflection is a measure of the amount of light reflected by the retroreflective
sheeting material used in the construction of a traffic sign face. As a traffic sign ages, its retroreflective
performance will degrade at a rate determined primarily by the extent of exposure to environmental
factors such as sunlight, moisture and pollutants.
For traffic signs constructed in accordance with BS EN 12899-1 [Ref 2.N], the measurement of the
coefficient of retroreflection should only be necessary seven years after installation for Performance
Class RA1 materials or 10 years after installation for Performance Class RA2, R2, R3B-UK and
R3C-UK materials.
Earlier measurements of the coefficient of retroreflection may be necessary where:
1) retroreflectivity is suspected of having degraded at a faster rate than assumed in this document;
2) the traffic sign has an overlay or coating for dew resistance or protection against graffiti which affects
its retroreflective performance.
To assess the extent of degradation in the retroreflective performance of a traffic sign, the coefficient of
retroreflection of the white areas of each traffic sign, including both original and replacement parts,
should be measured.
The measurement of the coefficient of retroreflection should be carried out using a calibrated, handheld
retroreflectometer with the settings adjusted to an observation angle of 20' and an entrance angle of
+5°. Reference should be made to BS EN 12899-1 [Ref 2.N] for supplementary details of the
procedure to be followed in measuring the coefficient of retroreflection, including definitions of the
observation angle and the entrance angle.
The retroreflectometer should be positioned against the traffic sign face and operated in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.
Before the measurement is carried out, the traffic sign face should be cleaned and the performance
class of the retroreflective sheeting material under assessment should be identified.
Appendix B provides examples for the identification of material performance classes where details are
not available in traffic sign asset records or on the back of the traffic sign.
The coefficient of retroreflection for colours other than white may be tested if:
1) there are no white areas of a traffic sign, or these are too small to be measured;
2) a non-white element of a traffic sign is suspected of having degraded at a faster rate than white or
other areas of the traffic sign; or
3) it is necessary to take a series of measurements to identify the performance class or approximate
age of the material under test.
Where the coefficient of retroreflection of part of the traffic sign is measured to be less than the relevant
intervention level stated in Appendix C, the traffic sign should be considered to be defective.
When measuring and interpreting the coefficient of retroreflection of a coloured area of a traffic sign
where the colour has faded (e.g. a red border fading to white), the coefficient of retroreflection can
show an unwanted increase in retroreflectivity.
Where a measurement of the coefficient of retroreflection shows an increase in retroreflectivity, the
traffic sign should be considered to be defective.
Mobile technologies can be used to take coefficient of retroreflection measurements where an
equivalent level of performance to a handheld retroreflectometer can be demonstrated.

Appendix B. Examples of retroreflective sheeting materials
This appendix provides examples in Figures B.1 to B.5 of retroreflective sheeting materials from each
of the coefficient of retroreflection performance classes in BS EN 12899-1 [Ref 2.N].
Where the coefficient of retroreflection of a traffic sign is being measured in accordance with the
guidance in Appendix A and in the absence of information in asset records or on the back of the traffic
sign, these examples can be used to assist in the identification of the material performance class in use
on the traffic sign.
Further information about the sheeting materials in use on traffic signs can be sought from sheeting
material manufacturers and suppliers of traffic signs.

Appendix D. Illustration of key structural elements, fixtures and fittings
This appendix describes one way of installing a traffic sign on traffic sign posts so that the installation is
structurally sound. The example illustrated in Figure D.1 and Figure D.2, and described in the notes,
reflects the most common type of traffic sign mounting arrangement found in the United Kingdom. For
details of alternative approaches to sign installation, reference should be made to installation
instructions provided by manufacturers and suppliers.

Figure D.2 Illustration of part of the rear of a sign showing joints installed at vertical
interfaces between panels to fasten the panels together (for clarity of the
illustration, the clips and butting clamps/plates are not shown).
NOTES:
1) Appropriately sized clips are attached at each point where a channel, which is designed to accept a
clip, square head bolt, nut and washer, crosses a support. The washer is placed between the nut
and the clip. The nut is tightened to the torque recommended by the clip supplier to secure the clip
to the traffic sign and to the support. Where a torque setting is not specified, the nut is made tight
plus a ¼ turn.
2) The individual panels of multi-panel traffic signs are secured together using butting plates or clamps,
and, where necessary, joints at vertical interfaces.
3) The following are outputs of design activities carried out in accordance with BS EN 12899-1 [Ref
2.N] by the manufacturer, supplier, installer and/or consultant to meet the structural performance
specified or required by the Overseeing Organisation:
a) post/support type and configuration;
b) foundation type and configuration;
c) the design or selection of the traffic sign substrate;
d) the design or selection of channels and their configuration/spacing; and
e) the design or selection of clips; butting clamps/plates; joints at vertical interfaces; and associated
fixings including nuts, bolts and washers.
4) Where it is necessary to verify the structural soundness of the above aspects of a traffic sign
installation, reference should be made to the installation instructions provided by the manufacturer,
supplier, installer and/or consultant, and the declared performance of the installation with respect to
BS EN 12899-1 [Ref 2.N].
5) Stainless steel banding is typically suitable for attaching smaller traffic signs to irregular support
sizes or shapes such as lighting columns. In all other situations, the appropriate size clip is used.
