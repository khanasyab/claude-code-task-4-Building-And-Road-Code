1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used for the design of corrugated steel buried structures (CSBSs), with spans
greater than or equal to 0.9 m and up to 8.0 m, which are straight in plan and can be described as one
of the following:
1)
bolted segmental construction with closed circular cross sections;
2)
bolted segmental construction with closed multi-radii cross section;
3)
bolted segmental construction with circular arch cross section; or,
4)
helically wound construction with closed circular cross sections.
1.1.1
Advice should be obtained from specialist manufacturers of the specific type of CSBS to be used.
NOTE 1
The data used in developing this design methodology was generally limited to structures of between
0.9 m to 8.0 m span, which is why these limits are imposed within this document.
NOTE 2
The data used in developing this design methodology for arch structures was generally restricted to
circular arches, which is why non-circular arches are not specifically included within this document.
1.2
The size and shape of the structure shall be within the limits set out in Table 1.2.
Table 1.2 Structure shapes and sizes covered by this document
Shape
Range of sizes
Circular structure
0.9 m ≤S ≤8.0 m
Multi-radii structure
0.9 m ≤S ≤8.0 m
The shapes conform to:
rb
rt < 3.5 and rc
rt > 0.2
Circular arch structure
2.0 m ≤S ≤8.0 m
The shapes conform to either:
Type 1 arch: 20° ≤θ ≤30°
Type 2 arch: 10° ≤θ ≤20°
1.3
This document shall not be used for CSBSs in the repair of other types of structure.
NOTE
An example where CSBSs are used in the repair of other types of structure is as a liner for brick arch
structures.
1.4
In situations using types of CSBS that are not covered in this document, Technical Approval Authority
approval shall be obtained.
1.4.1
Advice should be obtained from specialist manufacturers of the specific type of CSBS to be used.

1. Scope
1.5
Extensions to in-situ CSBSs shall be compatible with the existing structure and meet the requirements
of this document.
1.6
The environment shall be classed as "non-aggressive" or "aggressive" as defined in Section 8.
1.6.1
The classification should reflect actual site conditions at the CSBS location.
NOTE
An environment which is classed as "very aggressive" is outside the scope of this document.
1.7
The CSBSs to be used shall be subject to:
1)
Technical Approval procedures in accordance with CG 300 [Ref 23.N]
2)
Certification in accordance with CD 622 [Ref 20.N]
Implementation
1.8
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving design of CSBSs on the
Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 19.N].
Use of GG 101
1.9
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 19.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.
Environmental considerations
1.10
The Overseeing Organisation's requirements for environmental design shall be followed in designing
CSBSs.
NOTE
LD 118 [Ref 2.I] gives advice on the use of underpasses by multiple species of small mammals and
fish. It illustrates various forms of culvert design to facilitate free passage of these species. These
considerations can be fundamental to the determination of the span, headroom, cross-section invert
and gradient of the structure.

Actions for corrugated steel buried structures
Permanent actions for corrugated steel buried structures
3.1
The self-weight of the structure shall be included in the design for the following situations:
1)
when temporary struts or ties are required to support the structure during execution; and,
2)
for end treatments, the self-weight of headwalls, ring beams and collars.
3.1.1
For all other situations, the self-weight of the structure may be ignored.
NOTE 1
Section 10 includes requirements for where the structure needs supports during execution.
NOTE 2
Section 11 includes requirements for when the structure needs end treatments.
3.2
The characteristic vertical pressure, PGk , on the structure due the superimposed dead load shall be
taken from Equation 3.2:
Equation 3.2 Characteristic vertical pressure
PGk = γh
where:
γ
is the unit weight of compacted fill
h
is the nominal height of fill above the structure, to be taken as ht + 0.25r for circular
structures and ht + 0.25rt for multi-radii structures
ht
is the height of fill above the crown of the structure including the thickness of any road
construction
r
is the radius of closed circular structures or arch structures
rt
is the radius at the top of a multi-radii structure
NOTE
Different values of unit weight can be adopted for different layers of fill with different properties.
Variable actions for corrugated steel buried structures
3.3
The design shall include load models for normal and abnormal levels of traffic.
3.3.1
The traffic load models should be based on only one lane of traffic.
NOTE
The recommendation to consider the simplified design load model based on only one lane of traffic is a
design simplification and does not affect the traffic management of the structure. The use of this
simplification has been used historically and successfully in the UK for structures that carry more than
one lane.
3.3.2
Normal and abnormal traffic should be assessed separately.
3.3.3
Braking and acceleration effects may be ignored.
3.4
For normal traffic a single wheel load of 57.5 kN multiplied by an overload factor of 1.5 and a dynamic
amplification factor (DAF) of 1.4 shall be used.
3.4.1
On the carriageway each wheel load should be assumed to be uniformly distributed over a circular or
square contact area based on a nominal tyre inflation pressure of 1.1 N/mm2.
3.5
For abnormal traffic loads the relevant special vehicle (LM3) in BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 8.N] shall be used.
NOTE
CD 350 [Ref 26.N] specifies the special vehicles for particular classes of road and special order
vehicles.

3.6
To determine the characteristic vertical live load pressure, PLk , on the structure due to any wheel load,
dispersion in three dimensions shall be assumed from the limits of the contact area on the carriageway
to the level of the crown of the buried structure as shown in Figure 3.6.
1)
Zone 1: wheel load 1 and wheel load 2 are distributed over length L1 and L2 respectively.
2)
Zone 2: wheel load 1 and wheel load 2 are combined and distributed jointly over length L3.
Figure 3.6 Dispersion of adjacent wheel loads
3.6.1
Dispersion in three dimensions should be assumed at a slope of 2 vertically to 1 horizontally as shown
in Figure 3.7.
NOTE
Different dispersion slopes can be adopted for different layers of fill with different properties.
3.7
The characteristic vertical live load pressure, PLk , shall be taken to act over the whole span or part of
the span if more onerous.
3.8
A wheel load not directly over the structure shall be included if its dispersion zone falls over any part of
the structure.
3.9
The dispersion zones of individual wheel loads shall be combined and distributed jointly as indicated in
Figure 3.6.
3.10
Where a reinforced concrete structural slab is proposed, the dispersion of the wheel loads throughout
the slab and the soil shall be modelled in the design.
3.10.1
The dispersion of the wheel loads may be assumed to occur at a slope of 1 vertically to 1.5 horizontally
throughout the depth of the structural slab, and of 2 vertically to 1 horizontally below the bottom level of
the slab.
3.10.2
Alternatively, the dispersion of wheel loads may be modelled by a multi-layer elastic analysis, which
takes into account the relative stiffness of the structural slab and the layers of material between the slab
and the crown of the structure.
NOTE
Methods for load dispersion are provided in chapter 6 of "Elastic Solutions for Soil and Rock
Mechanics" by Poulos & Davis 1974 [Ref 4.I].

covered.
NOTE
This is relevant for example when a structure is used as a vehicular underpass or has invert protection.
Protective coatings and sacrificial steel thickness for corrugated steel buried
structures
8.16
Each surface of the structure shall have a sacrificial thickness of steel that allows for the corrosivity of
the environment, taking into account contributions to durability from galvanising and any secondary
protective coatings.
8.17
Unless measures are taken to fully protect galvanised surfaces against damage from the construction
process, the benefits of galvanising shall be ignored in calculating the steel thickness.
8.18
Where a secondary protective coating is specified, its protective life shall be as provided in the current
product acceptance scheme.
8.19
The life of the galvanised coating shall be calculated from the rate of corrosion, which can be taken as
4 µm/year in non-aggressive environments and 14 µm/year in aggressive environments.
8.19.1
The local galvanising thickness in accordance with BS EN ISO 1461 [Ref 18.N] should be used in
calculating the life of the galvanised coating.

NOTE
Inadequate protection and loss of sacrificial steel thickness can cause joint separation at connections,
which can lead to further deterioration, for example, washout of fill.
8.20
In the absence of a detailed evaluation of corrosion rates to BS EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N] for the corrosion
classes defined in BS EN ISO 12944-2 [Ref 22.N], the sacrificial thickness of steel, T ( µm ), needed to
provide 120 years life, excluding the life of the coatings, shall be calculated from either Equation 8.20a
for non aggressive environments or 8.20b for aggressive environments.
Equation 8.20a For non-aggressive environments
T = 22.5t0.67
where:
t
is the life of sacrificial thickness of steel
Equation 8.20b For aggressive environments
T = 40.0t0.80
where:
t
is the life of sacrificial thickness of steel
8.21
Where plates of different thickness are being used, they shall be placed in the correct location for which
they are intended.
NOTE
The calculated steel thickness can be different at different points around the circumference of the
structure.
Invert protection for corrugated steel buried structures
8.22
The invert of all structures carrying water or other fluid shall be protected from the effects of abrasion or
erosion (and scour in the case of circular arches) by adopting one of the following protection systems:
1)
reinforced concrete paving;
2)
paving blocks or precast slabs;
3)
liner plates; and,
4)
for structures with little or no flow, a coating certified as suitable for the end use by a current
product acceptance scheme.
NOTE
Section 11 includes requirements for these protection systems.
8.22.1
The use of liner plates should be designed to cover fluctuations of at least 200 mm above and below
the range of water depths.
8.23
The product acceptance scheme or equivalent body that certified the proprietary system as suitable for
use shall also certify its design life.
Impact protection for corrugated steel buried structures
8.24
In the case of structures to be used by vehicles, protection shall be provided to the sides of the
structure by kerbing and/or a vehicle restraint system.
8.25
Where impact protection is required, it shall not be connected to the sides of the structure.
8.26
Where structures are to be used by vehicles, headwalls or ring beams shall be designed to provide
protection to the crown/soffit.
8.27
Where structures are to be used by vehicles, drivers shall be alerted to the headroom restriction
created by means of visual and/or audible warning systems.
