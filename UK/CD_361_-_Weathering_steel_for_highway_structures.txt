4. Environmental classification
4.
Environmental classification
4.1
Prior to design, a site-specific atmospheric corrosivity classification, C1 to CX, shall be determined for
the structure location in accordance with BS EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N] using one of the following methods:
1)
method 1: corrosivity estimation for carbon steel based on the measurement of environmental
information in accordance with BS EN ISO 9225 [Ref 3.N];
2)
method 2: corrosivity determination based on corrosion rate measurement of standard carbon
steel specimens in accordance with BS EN ISO 9226 [Ref 2.N]; or
3)
method 3: corrosivity estimation based on a description of exposure conditions in accordance
with BS EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N].
4.1.1
The design programme should allow for the minimum time period required to obtain a representative
average value for the atmospheric corrosivity classification.
NOTE
BS EN ISO 9225 [Ref 3.N] (method 1) and BS EN ISO 9226 [Ref 2.N] (method 2) require
measurements to be taken over a minimum period of one year to obtain representative average values.
4.1.2
Where method 1 or method 2 are used for the site-specific atmospheric corrosivity classification, the
location chosen for taking measurements should closely replicate the exposure conditions that the
structure is to experience when in use.
4.2
Corrosivity estimation based on the description of exposure conditions in accordance with BS EN ISO
9223 [Ref 1.N] (method 3) shall not be used unless all the following apply:
1)
the structure is to be located more than 15 km inland from a coast;
2)
the structure is to be located in an area where it is not likely to be exposed to high levels of
atmospheric pollution or high levels of industrial fumes;
3)
the design programme does not permit either of the other two methods of classification (method 1
or method 2) to be used; and
4)
agreement has been obtained from the Overseeing Organisation.
4.2.1
Where corrosivity estimation based on the description of exposure conditions in accordance with BS
EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N] (method 3) is used, a site visit should be undertaken to assess the nature of the
structure location to inform the atmospheric corrosivity classification.
4.3
For structures that are to be located up to 15 km inland from a coast, the airborne salinity level shall be
determined in accordance with BS EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N] using the method described in BS EN ISO
9225 [Ref 3.N] based on a measuring period of one year.
4.3.1
The location chosen to determine the airborne salinity level should closely replicate the exposure
conditions that the structure is to experience when in use.
4.4
For structures that are to be located in an area where there can be high levels of atmospheric pollution
or high levels of industrial fumes, the airborne pollution level, as represented by SO2, shall be
determined in accordance with BS EN ISO 9223 [Ref 1.N] using the method described in BS EN ISO
9225 [Ref 3.N] based on a measuring period of one year.
NOTE
The pollution level classification is based on levels of atmospheric sulphur compounds.
4.4.1
The location chosen to determine the atmospheric pollution level should closely replicate the exposure
conditions that the structure is to experience when in use.
4.4.2
Where a source of atmospheric pollution other than atmospheric sulphur compounds is suspected,
such as high levels of a specific industrial pollutant, special investigations should be undertaken to
determine whether the use of weathering steel is viable.
4.5
The following atmospheric corrosivity classifications shall be used:
1)
internal surfaces of enclosed sections that are sealed against the ingress of moisture: C1;
2)
internal surfaces of enclosed sections that are not sealed against the ingress of moisture: C2;

5. Limitations on the use of weathering steel
5.
Limitations on the use of weathering steel
5.1
Weathering steel shall not be used in highway structures without an additional corrosion protection
treatment where any of the following exposure conditions apply:
1)
where the atmospheric corrosion classification has been determined as C5 or CX;
2)
where the airborne salinity level has been determined as S3;
3)
where the atmospheric pollution level has been determined as P3;
4)
where a source of atmospheric pollution other than atmospheric sulphur compounds has been
identified that makes the use of weathering steel unviable due to the extent of corrosion that is
likely to occur;
5)
where the weathering steel is likely to be continuously wet or damp;
6)
where the whole or part of the structure is likely to be subject to high concentrations of deicing
salts that can lead to substantial deposits of chloride on weathering steel surfaces, such as wide
structures over salted roads, structures over salted roads at below the minimum standard
headroom, structures located within 10.0 metres horizontally of a salted carriageway, or where
salt-laden water could flow directly over the weathering steel;
7)
for crossings over water where the headroom is less than 2.5 metres; and
8)
where weathering steel is close to or in contact with the ground.
NOTE
Adjacent trees, bushes or other obstructions can prevent the natural drying process causing
weathering steel surfaces to be continuously wet or damp.
5.1.1
Where the limitations apply to isolated parts of a structure, weathering steel may be used provided that
a corrosion protection treatment is applied to those isolated parts in accordance with CD 350 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE
Isolated parts of a structure that could benefit from local application of a corrosion protection treatment
include parts adjacent to expansion joints.
5.1.2
Weathering steel may be encased in concrete without additional corrosion protection, provided that the
concrete cover exceeds that required for durability.
5.1.3
Where a corrosion protection treatment is proposed to protect isolated weathering steel parts adjacent
to unprotected weathering steel, the colour of the finish coat to the corrosion protection treatment
should be chosen to harmonise with the anticipated final colour of the exposed weathering steel.
5.2
Details of any current or planned obstructions or works that could prevent the drying of weathering steel
shall be obtained and used in the decision of whether to use weathering steel in a structure.

Corrosion allowances
General requirements for corrosion allowances
6.1
The corrosion allowances given in this section shall be applied to all highway structures with a design
life of up to and including 120 years.
6.2
A corrosion allowance shall be applied to each exposed surface of weathering steel in a structure to
cater for the loss of structurally effective material due to the rust patina that develops over the design
life of the structure.
6.2.1
A corrosion allowance should be applied to fillet welds and partial penetration butt welds.
NOTE
Full penetration butt welds do not normally require any corrosion allowance, because an allowance has
been applied to the parent material thickness.
6.2.2
A corrosion allowance should not be applied to mechanical fasteners.
6.2.3
Where a corrosion protection treatment is applied to a weathering steel surface in accordance with CD
350 [Ref 9.N], the treated surface is protected from corrosion and no corrosion allowance should be
applied to the affected surface.
6.3
Corrosion allowances shall be applied to weathering steel surfaces in accordance with Table 6.3, based
on the atmospheric corrosivity classification of the environment that the weathering steel is to be
exposed to.

Weathering steel structures shall be detailed to ensure that the weathering steel performs as intended
and that long term durability is achieved.
7.2
Weathering steel structures shall be detailed:
1)
to allow the natural drying process to occur for all parts and elements in order to enable the
protective rust patina to develop;
2)
to avoid features that allow water or debris to collect, leading to prolonged wetness of weathering
steel surfaces;
3)
so that weathering steel surfaces are not affected by water runoff;
4)
to prevent unsightly staining of substructures; and
5)
to restrict unauthorised access to weathering steel surfaces to reduce the likelihood of graffiti
being applied to them.
7.2.1
The following should be provided when designing and detailing joints in weathering steel structures:
1)
expansion joints that prevent water flowing directly over weathering steel surfaces;
2)
joints located to ensure water does not run over weathering steel surfaces in the event a joint
fails; and
3)
ventilation at and around support areas and beneath joints to avoid weathering steel surfaces
from remaining wet or damp for extended periods.
7.2.2
The following details should be used for drainage systems in weathering steel structures:
1)
positive drainage systems;
2)
drip details to the edges of concrete decks in composite weathering steel bridges; and

Where enclosed sections are not sealed against the ingress of moisture, provision shall be made for
free drainage of the enclosed section and to allow inspection of all weathering steel surfaces.
NOTE 1
CD 350 [Ref 9.N]requires all internal spaces that are to be hermetically sealed, i.e. against the ingress
of moisture, to be identified as an output from the design of structural steelwork.
NOTE 2
Sections are not considered to be sealed against the ingress of moisture where one or more of the
sides of the enclosed section is concrete.
7.4
A non-conductive barrier shall be provided where a dissimilar metal is in contact with weathering steel
and bimetallic corrosion can have a detrimental effect on the parts that are in contact.
NOTE 1
Accelerated corrosion can occur in local areas where there are dissimilar metals directly in contact with
weathering steel parts.
