Revision 2 (March 2020) Revision to update references only. Revision 1
(October 2018) This revision reflects a minor change to a typographical error in
clause 4.2. Clause 4.2 now reads as a requirement with 11 sub points and two
corresponding notes. Revision 0 (June 2018) CD 360 replaces BD 81/02. This
full document has been re-written to be compliant with the new Highways
England drafting rules.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides requirements and advice for the use of the compressive membrane action in
the design and assessment of reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs.
Flexure of unrestrained slabs is associated with in-plane movements at the supports which are
compatible with the vertical deflections of the slab. However, if these movements are restrained
effectively, a system of compressive forces can be established which carries the load in an arching
action. This behaviour is known as compressive membrane action and can significantly increase the
load capacity of the slab.
Several studies have shown the beneficial effects of the compressive membrane action to the strength
of reinforced concrete deck slabs where sufficient restraints exist. Many of the criteria given in this
document are based on experimental evidence, which has been conservatively interpreted for use in
the design and assessment. A summary of the most recent research and testing can be found in 'A
review of arching and compressive membrane action in concrete bridges' Collings & Sagaseta [Ref 1.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

2. Design
2.
Design
General
2.1
Reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs shall be designed in accordance with BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 3.N]
and this document.
2.2
Individual primary and secondary elements shall be designed to resist the loading which produces the
most adverse effects due to combined global and local effects, where they coexist, in addition to the
loading directly applied to them.
2.3
Analysis of the structure shall be carried out by separate analyses for global and local effects.
Serviceability limit state
2.4
In order to allow for the effects of compressive membrane action on the global load distribution, two
separate analyses shall be carried out using the flexural stiffness constants (second moment of area)
for sections of discrete members or unit widths of slab elements as follows:
1) Design of members spanning in the direction of compressive membrane action (i.e. the deck slab in
beam and slab construction): the entire member cross-section, ignoring the reinforcement, for all
members.
2) Design of members spanning in the other direction (i.e. the longitudinal beams in beam and slab
construction): half of the member cross-sectional width, ignoring the reinforcement, for the member
subject to compressive membrane action (i.e. the deck slab), and the full member cross-sectional
width, ignoring the reinforcement, for the other members (i.e. longitudinal beams).
2.4.1
The deck slab may be designed for twice the moment given by analysis 2 above, in order to avoid the
need to undertake two separate analyses.
2.5
For reinforced concrete bridge deck slab panels restrained as defined in 4.2, the crack width due to
global effect only shall be determined in accordance with BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 3.N].
Ultimate limit state
2.6
Elastic method shall be used to determine the distribution of forces, as stated in 2.4.
2.7
Where the slabs comply with all the limitations of 4.2, the empirical method given in 4.3 to 4.12 shall be
used for local analysis.
2.8
Where reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs are restrained as defined in 4.2, the deck slab
reinforcement shall be derived on the basis of global effects only, in accordance with BS EN 1992-2
[Ref 3.N].
2.9
The resistance to local effects shall be derived from the formulae in clauses 4.3 to 4.12.
NOTE
Punching shear is taken account of through the procedures presented in this document.
Minimum area of reinforcement
2.10
The minimum steel area provided in the deck slab in each face in each direction shall be 0.3% of the
gross concrete section.
2.11
The spacing of the bars shall be not greater than 250 mm.
2.12
The reinforcement in both faces in the direction of the primary slab span shall not be less than 750 mm2
/m.
2.13
Where longitudinal reinforcement is required to resist global effects (e.g. in continuous bridges), the

Calculation of local capacity of bridge deck slabs
General
4.1
The following method shall be used to calculate the ultimate local capacity of laterally restrained deck
slabs for design and assessment.
NOTE
This method assumes that the slab reinforcement makes no contribution to the local load carrying
capacity.
Limitations
4.2
The procedures given in clauses 4.3 to 4.12 shall only be used for design and assessment of bridge
deck slabs that comply with the following limitations:
1) The transverse (primary) span length of a slab panel perpendicular to the direction of traffic does not
exceed 3.7 m.
2) The slab extends at least 1.0 m beyond the centre line of the external longitudinal supports of a
panel.
3) The span length to thickness ratio of the slab does not exceed 15.
4) In skew slabs, the skew span length to thickness ratio does not exceed 15.
5) For skew angles greater than 20°, the end portion of the deck is designed or assessed in
accordance with BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 3.N] or CS 455 [Ref 6.N] respectively.
6) Transverse edges at the ends of the bridge and at intermediate points where the continuity of the
slab is broken are both supported by diaphragms or other suitable means and are designed for the
full effects of the wheel loads.
7) Cross frames or diaphragms are present at the support lines of all bridges.
8) Bridges with steel beams also have cross frames or diaphragms at centres not exceeding 8 m or
half of the span of the bridge.
9) Bridges with concrete beams, other than prestressed beams complying with the serviceability
imitations of BS EN 1992-2 [Ref 3.N] for design and CS 455 [Ref 6.N] for assessment, have at least
one intermediate diaphragm in each span.
10) All the cross frames or diaphragms extend throughout the width of the bridge between external
girders and extend from the top to the bottom flange, or in case of T section beams with no distinct
bottom flange, from the slab over at least 75% of the depth of the web.
11) Edge beams are present for all slabs having main reinforcement parallel to traffic.
NOTE 1
Where in an external panel the combined cross-sectional area of slab and kerb, beyond the centre line
of the external girder, is not less than the cross-sectional area of one metre length of deck slab,
(referred to in item 2 in the list above) a kerb or string course integral with the slab can be used instead
of the 1.0 m overhang.
NOTE 2
An edge beam (referred to in item 11 in the list above) can consist of a slab section reinforced to carry
the full effect of wheel loads, a beam integral with and deeper than the slab, an integral reinforced
section of slab and kerb, or a continuous parapet or barrier to stiffen the edge of the slab.
Procedure
4.3
The concrete compressive cube strength shall be expressed as the equivalent cylinder strength
fc
(
N/mm2)
given by Equation 4.3a for assessment and Equation 4.3b for design.
