Introduction
Introduction
Background
The appropriate choice of surface course material plays a key role in providing roads that are safe,
meet the needs of the user and offer good value for money. Permitted surface course materials and
guidance on their selection are presented in this document.
In dry conditions all clean, surfaced roads have a high skidding resistance. However in wet conditions
the skidding resistance is reduced. Using aggregates with an appropriate resistance to polishing for a
particular site and traffic loading should result in a surfacing giving wet skidding resistance above the
appropriate investigatory level (IL) assigned in accordance with CS 228 [Ref 2.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Site category and investigatory level for aggregate selection
3.1
Where a site has not been allocated a site category and investigatory level, they shall be determined in
accordance with CS 228 [Ref 2.N].
Traffic flow for aggregate selection
3.2
The number of commercial vehicles per day for the site shall be determined in accordance with CD 224
[Ref 4.N].
3.3
The traffic in commercial vehicles per lane per day (cv/lane/day) used in Tables 3.7a, 3.7b and 3.11
shall be the anticipated traffic using the lane at the end of the anticipated life of the surfacing.
3.4
The traffic in commercial vehicles per lane per day (cv/lane/day) shall be lane specific.
Polished stone value (PSV) for aggregate selection
3.5
The aggregates used in pavement quality concrete shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 3
of this document.
3.6
Coarse aggregates or chippings shall undergo polished stone value (PSV) testing in accordance with
BS EN 1097-8 [Ref 3.N] to determine the resistance to polishing under the action of traffic.

3. Aggregate selection
NOTE 1
The default IL for each site category is indicated by the rows in bold in Table 3.7a or Table 3.7b in
alignment with CS 228 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE 2
Surfacing material containing a high proportion of calcined bauxite and 68+ PSV natural aggregate
blend in the mix can offer a similar skid resistance performance and durability to that provided by HFS
in some of the site category and IL combinations in table 3.7b.
3.7.1
The PSV of coarse aggregate in surfacings under HFS should be the same as the surrounding
surfacing within the lane.
3.8
Where a single lane is being resurfaced for maintenance purposes, the PSV and AAV shall be selected
based on the site category, IL and traffic for that lane.
NOTE
The PSVs and AAVs chosen need not match the values of existing adjacent surfacing.
3.9
For lanes with a design traffic of zero commercial vehicles, the minimum PSV of chippings and coarse
aggregates in surfacings other than pavement quality concrete shall be 50.
3.10
Basic oxygen steel slag aggregate complying with the chemical composition in Table 3.10 shall be
classified as equivalent to PSV60 aggregate up to and including 5,000 cv/lane/day traffic at the design
life in site categories A, B and C when used in a thin surface course system.

NOTE 1
The aggregate abrasion value (AAV) of the coarse aggregate or chippings is determined in accordance
with Annex A BS EN 1097-8 [Ref 3.N] having regard to the durability or resistance of the aggregate to
abrasion under the action of traffic.
NOTE 2
Heavily trafficked sites using surface dressing can be susceptible to wear (and loss of texture depth)
where the AAV of the chippings is greater than 8.

NOTE 1
Some of the particular factors that can influence the selection of a surface course material are provided
in Appendix E/A.
NOTE 2
Traffic noise in lower speed zones (up to 50 km/h) is mainly attributable to engine, transmission and
exhaust noise, especially from lorries.
NOTE 3
Where noise levels are high due to the intensity of high-speed traffic, surfacing materials are available
that can significantly reduce tyre/road generated noise emission compared to hot rolled asphalt (HRA).
These include thin surface course systems.
NOTE 4
Pavement quality concrete can be ordinary pavement quality concrete or early strength pavement
quality concrete with a brushed finish (rigid construction only).
E/1.2
CAUTS shall not be used on sites with the following site categories:
1)
site category A (motorways)
2)
site category K (approaches to pedestrian crossing and other high risk situations)
3)
site category R (roundabouts)
4)
Site category S1 and S2 (bends radius <500 m)
5)
site category G1 and G2 (gradients ≥5% longer than 50 m)
E/1.3
Stone mastic asphalt surface course shall only be used where the carriageway geometry meets current
design standards.

E/1.6
New lay-by and hardstanding locations shall use one of the following surfacings:
1)
bituminous mixtures with deformation and fuel resisting properties;
2)
concrete paving blocks; or,
3)
pavement quality concrete.
NOTE 1
'Fuel resisting' is defined as a bituminous mixture that conforms to Cimax6 when tested to BS EN
12697-43 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
'Deformation resisting' is defined as a bituminous mixture developing a rut depth (RD) of less than 2.5
mm when tested with a small device at 60 °C using procedure A for 1000 cycles to BS EN 12697-22
[Ref 2.I].
E/1.7
Existing lay-bys shall be resurfaced with either:
1)
the same surfacing type as the adjacent carriageway;
2)
bituminous mixtures with deformation and fuel resisting properties;
3)
concrete paving blocks; or,
4)
pavement quality concrete.
E/1.7.1
Existing bus lay-bys should be resurfaced with either:
1)
bituminous mixtures with deformation and fuel resisting properties;
2)
concrete paving blocks; or,
3)
pavement quality concrete.
Emergency areas
E/1.8
Emergency areas (EAs) shall be surfaced with emergency area surface treatment or coloured thin
surface course systems.
E/1.9
When emergency area surface treatment is used, it shall be installed over a surface course from Table
E/1.1.
Noise sensitive sites
E/1.10
A site shall be classed as noise sensitive if noise-sensitive receptors are located within 600 m of the
roadside.
NOTE
Receptors potentially sensitive to noise include dwellings, hospitals, healthcare facilities, education
facilities, community facilities, Environmental Noise Directive quiet areas or potential Environmental
Noise Directive quiet areas, international and national or statutory designated sites, public rights of way,
cultural heritage assets and areas of landscape or biodiversity. Areas of landscape or biodiversity value
include areas of bird nesting or areas with multiple footpaths used regularly for recreation.
E/1.11
Low noise surfacing shall be used on 'noise sensitive' sites other than on bridge decks and sites where
the traffic speed is 50 km/h or less.
E/1.11.1
All departure applications to use non-low noise surfacing should be supported with a value-for- money
calculation.
NOTE
Guidance on calculating the value for money of a 'noise sensitive' departure is provided in Appendix
E/B.
Surface course on bridge decks
E/1.12
On bridge decks, the surface course shall be selected from the options in Table E/1.11 based on the
surface drainage type.

NOTE
Ponding of water in the surface layers, particularly TSCS, can occur if the bridge deck has not been
fitted with an asphalt drainage system. Ponded water can contribute to reduced durability of the surface
under trafficking and freeze/thaw conditions.
E/1.12.1
The design should include the application of performance hot rolled asphalt surface course for the
entire length of the bridge deck and 15 m either side of any vertical discontinuity in the pavement
surface, even when the surrounding pavement is surfaced with a different material.
NOTE
Vertical discontinuities in the pavement surface include plug joints and metallic elements of bridge
joints.

cost-benefit ratio as follows:
1)
cost of the proposed surface over 60 years, when compared to standard surface, taking into
account the number of renewals anticipated over 60 years; and,
2)
cost of noise at noise sensitive receptors within 600 m of the proposed surfaces over 60 years as
defined by TAG Unit A1-3 [Ref 4.I]and TAG Unit A3 [Ref 5.I] or any update thereof.
E/B2
Noise cost
Further information on how to calculate noise cost is provided as follows:
1)
if a noise model is available for the scheme it can be used to accurately calculate noise exposure
for properties within 600 m, which can thereafter be used to calculate cost;
2)
if no noise model is available, existing noise exposure for properties can be estimated using
DEFRA noise mapping data, and properties within 600 m can be assumed to experience the
same noise change if surface characteristics change; and,
3)
the noise cost of a surface should increase by a maximum of £25,000 per property over 60 years
for every increase of 3 dB. This figure can be used to quickly calculate the maximum cost of
additional noise in sparsely populated areas.
Non-residential noise-sensitive receptors such as Environmental Noise Directive quiet areas, schools
and hospitals are not accounted for in the above calculation and can be important factors in selection of
surfacing materials.

NI/1. Surface course material options (CD 236, 2.1)
NI/1.2
Existing surfaces shall not be retextured.
NI/1.2.1
Small lengths of pavement may be retextured with the permission of the Overseeing Organisation
where a specific skidding or safety concern has been identified.
NI/1.3
Surface treatments shall only be applied to a new or existing surface course or surface treatment.
Lay-bys and hardstanding locations
NI/1.4
The surface course for new lay-bys and hardstanding locations on trunk roads shall be selected from
one of the following options:
1)
pavement quality concrete;
2)
concrete paving blocks; or,
3)
bituminous mixtures with deformation- and fuel-resistant properties.
NOTE 1
'Fuel-resistant' is defined as a bituminous mixture that suffers a loss of less than 6% mean value of the
combined loss of mass (Cimax) when tested to BS EN 12697-43 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 2
'Deformation-resistant' is defined as developing a rut of less than 2.5 mm when tested to BS EN
12697-22 [Ref 3.I].
NOTE 3
Grouted macadam can provide a suitable surfacing for lay-bys and hardstanding locations.
NI/1.5
Existing lay-bys shall be resurfaced with either:
1)
the same surfacing type as the adjacent carriageway in agreement with the project sponsor;
2)
bituminous mixtures with deformation- and fuel- resisting properties;
3)
concrete paving blocks; or,
4)
pavement quality concrete.
Noise-sensitive sites
NI/1.6
Where any of the following applies, a site shall be classed as 'noise-sensitive':
1)
the location has been identified as a noise important area in any of Northern Ireland's noise
action plans published by DAERA NAP(NI) [Ref 6.N];
2)
noise-sensitive receptors' are located within 600 m from the roadside (and 600 m from the ends
of the sections);
3)
noise barriers or earth bunds have been installed as a noise mitigation measure; or,
4)
there are designated areas of landscape or biodiversity value within 600 m of the roadside (and
600 m from the ends of the sections).
NOTE 1
Examples of 'sensitive receptors' are given in LA 111 [Ref 5.I].
NOTE 2
Areas of landscape or biodiversity value include areas of bird nesting or areas with multiple footpaths
used regularly for recreation.
NI/1.7
Noise-sensitive areas shall be assessed and mitigations provided, taking account of site-specific
factors, in agreement with the project sponsor.
NI/1.7.1
Where noise levels are high due to the intensity of high-speed traffic, surfacing materials may be used
that can reduce tyre/road-generated noise emission compared to hot rolled asphalt (HRA).
NOTE 1
Surfacing materials that can significantly reduce tyre/road-generated noise emission can include, for
example thin surface course systems (TSCS).
NOTE 2
Traffic noise at lower speed zones (85%ile traffic speed below 50 km/h) is mainly attributable to engine,
transmission and exhaust noise, especially from lorries.
NOTE 3
Further information on NMAs can be obtained from the Overseeing Organisation.

HRA, surface dressing and cold-applied ultra-thin surfacing shall only be used for sites where:
1)
the location has not been identified as a priority area in the Welsh Government's 'Noise and
Soundscape action plan 2023-2028' N&SAP [Ref 6.N]published in June 2023 or any update
thereof;
2)
no noise action priority areas are located within an envelope of 600 metres from the roadside and
600 metres from the ends of section;
3)
the scheme is not considered noise-sensitive and has not received any noise mitigation
measures; and,
4)
no residential areas, schools, hospitals or similar are within 600 metres of the proposed scheme.
W/1.5.1
Traffic noise at speeds <50 km/h is mainly attributed to engine, transmission and exhaust noise,
especially from larger vehicles and therefore, all materials should be assessed for use.
