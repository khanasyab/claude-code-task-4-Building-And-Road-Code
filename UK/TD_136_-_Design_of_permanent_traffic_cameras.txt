Introduction
Introduction
Background
Permanent traffic cameras for roadside technology and communications are provided to assist with the
management of traffic on roads.
The primary users of the permanent traffic cameras are control centre operators. The Operators are
able to move and zoom the cameras to monitor and manage congestion and incidents. The cameras
give a bird's eye view of what is happening which helps the Operator to decide on the support needed.
Permanent traffic camera coverage is particularly beneficial in the following situations:-
1)
where there are high traffic flows with recurrent congestion or queues, particularly in urban areas
at terminal junctions, interchanges, or where the number of lanes reduces;
2)
at interchanges with high traffic flows where there are converging/diverging movements or
sub-standard construction features such as sharp bends;
3)
at locations such as tunnels where traffic congestion or accidents can create dangerous
environmental conditions;
4)
on exposed bridges or motorways at high elevations above sea level where inclement weather
conditions such as high cross winds frequently can occur and occur hazardous conditions.
5)
Verifying incident reports, such as from customers or system generated i.e. stopped vehicle
detection alerts.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.

3.1
Where an operational need has been established, permanent traffic cameras for roadside technology
and communications shall be provided on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
NOTE 1
Operational requirements includes maintenance and calibration of ramp metering equipment, which
requires visibility of the equipment.
NOTE 2
The operational benefits of permanent traffic cameras can be maximised by combining with variable
message signs to provide prompt information to drivers and thus reduce the frequency of secondary
accidents.
3.1.1
Permanent traffic cameras for general surveillance for roadside technology and communications should
be provided in the locations detailed in Table 3.1.1.

Table 3.1.1 Permanent traffic camera criteria
Traffic volume
Coverage
Motorway/motorway interchanges or motorway/major all-purpose trunk road
interchanges where there is a traffic diversion strategy or where speed or
lane width restrictions are needed because of construction features such as
sub-standard radius bends.
Motorway sections or interchanges with four or more running lanes per
carriageway where there are converging/diverging traffic movements over a
distance of less than 2 km.
Elevated motorways within built-up areas.
Within and on the approaches to motorway tunnels.
Urban motorways with tidal flow and/or reduced width, or no hard shoulders.
Motorway interchanges or points with lane reductions where weekday
congestion frequently occurs and queues then exceed 1 km.
Exposed motorway bridges or at high elevations above sea level, where
inclement weather conditions frequently necessitate restrictions or diversions.
Exceptionally on all-purpose trunk roads in the vicinity of motorway junctions
where the above criteria are met.
Traffic flow exceeds an overall average of 10,000 vehicles per lane per day
on an existing motorway, or is forecast to exceed this level within the 15 year
high growth estimate for a new motorway.
Within links, maximum camera spacing of 1.5 km with each camera covering
up to 750 m of motorway and a maximum gap in coverage of 200 m.
Traffic flow is less than an overall average of 10,000 vehicles per lane per day
on an existing motorway, or is not forecast to exceed this level within the 15
year high growth estimate for a new motorway.
Areas with an operational need for coverage, such as incident hot-spots,
inclement weather, junctions, hills or lane drops and gains.

3. Provision of permanent traffic cameras for ro...
3.1.2
The control centre operators should be consulted regarding the proposed provision of permanent traffic
cameras for roadside technology and communications on schemes to confirm the operational need for
permanent traffic cameras.
NOTE
Local operational intelligence can provide insights on problematic locations which are not easily
identified through traditional data analysis.
3.1.3
Incident management system logs and road traffic collision data should be used to determine incident
hot-spots on existing roads.
3.2
On motorways incorporating variable mandatory speed limits where the hard shoulder is not used as a
running lane or where it is dynamically used as a running lane, permanent traffic camera coverage for
roadside technology and communications shall enable:
1)
operators to see in excess of 95% of the total scheme area and be able to interpret the images
correctly;
2)
view of a 1.75 m cube to represent a minimum of 5% of the image height at maximum zoom; and,
3)
coverage of emergency roadside telephones.
3.3
On motorways incorporating variable mandatory speed limits without a hard shoulder, permanent traffic
camera coverage for roadside technology and communications shall include the whole carriageway,
emergency areas and maintenance hard standings, where provided to enable:
1)
operators to see the entire mainline carriageway running lanes and the full extent of emergency
areas with no blind spots in all ambient lighting levels;
2)
view of a 1.75 m cube to represent a minimum of 5% of the image height at maximum zoom; and,
3)
views of emergency roadside telephones in emergency areas that represent a minimum of 10%
of the image height.
NOTE
A blind spot exists if a 1.75 m wide cube target (or the remaining visible area of this target when
obscured) does not represent at least 5% of image height and width.
3.4
On motorways where stopped vehicle detection is provided, permanent traffic camera coverage for
roadside technology and communications shall enable control centre operators to verify stopped
vehicle detection alerts.
3.5
Permanent traffic cameras for roadside technology and communications associated with an emergency
area shall include a pre-set position to view and zoom into the emergency area in addition to the home
position and any other positions agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
3.6
Permanent traffic camera coverage of an emergency roadside telephone located at a new short section
of hard shoulder or hard shoulder defined as a place of relative safety shall represent a minimum of
10% of image height for roadside technology and communications.
3.7
Permanent traffic camera coverage drawings showing the viewing areas of each camera shall be
produced for roadside technology and communications.
NOTE 1
Permanent traffic camera coverage drawings provide plan view and cross-section splays.
NOTE 2
The permanent traffic camera coverage drawings can be used to verify coverage during installation and
once in operation.
