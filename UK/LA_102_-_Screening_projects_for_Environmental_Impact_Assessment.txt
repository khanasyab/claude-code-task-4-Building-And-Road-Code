2.
Principles and purpose of screening
Annex I projects
2.1
Where a project meets the criteria in Annex I of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N], as reproduced in Table 2.1,
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be undertaken.
Table 2.1 Extract from Annex I of the EIA Directive (Ref 3.N) to identify projects that require a
mandatory EIA
Extract from the EIA
Directive
Project type
Annex I (7)
b) Construction of motorways and express roads.
NOTE Express road is defined as a road which complies with the
definition in the European Agreement on Main International Traffic
Arteries of 15 November 1975 [Ref 4.N] "Roads reserved for
automobile traffic, accessible only from interchanges or controlled
junctions and on which, in particular, stopping and parking are
prohibited".
c) Construction of a new road of four or more lanes, or realignment
and/or widening of an existing road of two lanes or less so as to
provide four or more lanes, where such new road, or realigned
and/or widened section of road would be 10 km or more in a
continuous length.
NOTE Point c) is interpreted to be construction of a dual
carriageway or larger road or widening of a single carriageway into
a dual carriageway or larger road.
NOTE
For Annex I projects, consideration of Annex II, II.A and III of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] is not required.
Annex II projects
2.2
Projects that do not fall under Annex I of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] must be screened against Annex II
of the EIA Directive.
2.2.1
Screening should be undertaken for those projects that do not fall under Annex I or II of the EIA
Directive [Ref 3.N], where there is a potential for likely significant environmental effects arising from a
project.
2.3
Projects shall apply the specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.4
For maintenance activities, the specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisations shall apply.
Screening Annex II projects against Annex III criteria
2.5
Where a project falls under Annex II of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N], projects must provide evidence that
the relevant selection criteria set out in Annex III of the EIA Directive have been taken into account in
concluding whether a project is likely to have significant effects on the environment.
2.6
Where a project is likely to result in significant environmental effects an EIA must be undertaken in
accordance with the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N].
2.7
Where an Annex II project is not likely to result in significant environmental effects, this shall be
recorded according to the specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.7.1
Where a project has an absence of significant environmental effects, the environmental assessment
should provide sufficient evidence to support the decision to not undertake an EIA.

2. Principles and purpose of screening
2.8
For maintenance activities, the specific screening requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall
apply.
Re-screening
2.9
Projects shall be re-screened where there are material changes:
1) in the physical characteristics and/or location of the project;
2) in the environmental assessment assumptions e.g. the construction or design year; and
3) in the level of understanding of the current state of the environment (baseline scenario).

3. Screening and the project lifecycle
3.
Screening and the project lifecycle
3.1
A screening request shall be submitted to the competent authority as soon as the information required
in Annex II.A of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] can be compiled with sufficient evidence to support a
screening opinion.
NOTE
Sufficient evidence to support a screening opinion can typically be gathered once a project has
identified the preferred option and, there is a level of certainty regarding a projects characteristics,
location and environmental baseline to determine likely significant environmental effects.
3.1.1
Where sufficient information exists to make a judgement on likely significant environmental effects
towards the conclusion of options selection stage, a screening request may be submitted.
3.1.2
When compiling a screening request, the principles of environmental assessment in LA 101 [Ref 2.I]
Introduction to environmental assessment should apply and include a level of work sufficient to support
the screening conclusions.
NOTE
A level of uncertainty in the screening conclusions can be included and accepted so long as they can
be reasonably justified.

Screening and consultation
4.1
All relevant authorities affected by a project shall be identified and engaged where this would support
the screening conclusions.
NOTE 1
There are no mandatory requirements under the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] to undertake consultation in
respect to reaching screening conclusions (project teams) or making a screening opinion (competent
authority).
NOTE 2
Engagement with the relevant authorities affected by a project can assist in understanding the
environmental (and wider) risks associated with a project.

5. Reporting

Reporting
Annex I projects
5.1
Where a project falls under Annex I of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N], a record of the decision must be
made supported by sufficient evidence.
5.2
Projects shall apply the specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation, in recording evidence of
decisions.
Annex II projects
5.3
Where a project falls under Annex II of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N], projects shall submit a screening
request to the competent authority providing the information required by Annex II.A of the Directive.
5.4
Screening requests must describe the elements of projects, and/or any mitigation measures and
monitoring envisaged to avoid, prevent, reduce and, if possible, offset significant adverse effects on the
environment, in accordance with the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N].
5.4.1
Screening requests should only include those elements and/or mitigation measures, where there is
evidence that:
1) they are technically achievable and will deliver the desired outcome;
2) they are deliverable in terms of project budgets; and
3) there is a relevant legal route to support their delivery.
5.4.2
The level of information reported against the items in Annex II.A should be proportionate to the scale or
complexity of project being screened.
5.4.3
Professional judgement should be exercised when deciding the level of effort and environmental
assessment necessary to support the screening conclusions.
5.5
Projects shall apply the specific environmental assessment reporting requirements of the Overseeing
Organisation.
5.6
Where a project does not fall under Annex II of the EIA Directive [Ref 3.N] a record of the decision shall
be made with sufficient evidence.
Publishing the screening opinion
5.7
The screening opinion must be published by the competent authority in accordance with the EIA
Directive [Ref 3.N].
5.8
Liaison with the Overseeing Organisation shall be established to ensure the screening opinion is
published in a timely manner.
5.8.1
Where there is potential for a challenge to be made following the publication of a screening opinion,
projects should identify whether a 'standstill period' is required.
5.8.2
When deciding whether a 'standstill period' is appropriate, the following issues should be identified:
1) the degree of confidence that the screening opinion has been based on appropriate information and
sound judgement; and
2) any knowledge about any potential risk of judicial challenge.
NOTE
There is no requirement for a 'standstill period' following publication of a negative screening opinion
and the start of construction.

1) compile information on the characteristics of the project and its likely effects on the environment,
including the information specified in Annex II.A of the EIA Directive [Ref 1.N];
2) take into account the selection criteria set out in Annex III, as relevant to the project.
NI/2.2
The project team's screening report, where relevant, must take account of the available results of other
