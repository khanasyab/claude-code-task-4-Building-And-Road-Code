1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements and procedures in this document shall be followed when scoping a project, to reach

LA 103 Revision 1
2. Principles and purpose of scoping
2.
Principles and purpose of scoping
2.1
Scoping shall ensure that environmental assessment is proportionate, by identifying those
environmental factors (or any elements):
1) which are likely to result in significant environmental effects; and
2) where sufficient uncertainty for significant environmental effects remains.
NOTE
Uncertainty can exist where there are data gaps or insufficient information available to scope
environmental factors (or any elements) out.
2.2
Scoping shall:
1) provide justification, supported by evidence, for scoping in/out environmental factors (or any
elements) from further environmental assessment;
2) define what level of environmental assessment (simple or detailed) is to be undertaken for those
environmental factors (or any elements) scoped in;
3) specify the environmental assessment methodology and further data collection and survey
requirements;
4) identify the study area for those environmental factors (or any elements) scoped in; and
5) identify initial mitigation measures and environmental enhancements.
2.3
Scoping conclusions shall inform option, design and planning decisions.
2.3.1
Scoping should:
1) influence the design process with a view to 'designing out' adverse effects where possible;
2) inform the decision on whether a project can proceed as planned or whether the design needs to
change; and
3) identify environmental design principles.
NOTE
Further information on significant environmental effects is provided in LA 104 [Ref 7.N] Environmental
assessment and monitoring.

LA 103 Revision 1
3. Scoping and the project lifecycle
3.
Scoping and the project lifecycle
3.1
Scoping shall be undertaken ahead of environmental assessment (see LA 104 [Ref 7.N] Environmental
assessment and monitoring) and specifically during:
1) initial scheme identification;
2) option identification/selection; and
3) preliminary design of the preferred option.
3.1.1
During initial scheme identification and option identification/selection, scoping should, in the absence of
specific evidence, be undertaken on a precautionary basis.
3.1.2
During preliminary design of the preferred option, scoping should be supported by a refined level of
evidence and understanding of the project characteristics and the current state of the environment
(baseline scenario) and those environmental factors (or any elements) likely to be affected.
NOTE 1
An example of the absence of specific evidence can include environmental factors where there are
data gaps or insufficient information available.
NOTE 2
Where scoping is supported by additional information, the scope of further environmental assessment
can be defined with greater certainty, and therefore move away from the inclusion of environmental
factors (or any elements) on a precautionary basis.
3.2
Scoping shall be repeated where there are material changes:
1) in the physical characteristics and/or location of the project;
2) in the environmental assessment assumptions e.g. the construction or design year; and
3) in the level of understanding of the current state of the environment (baseline scenario).

Scoping and consultation
4.1
The specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall be followed when obtaining a scoping
opinion.
NOTE 1
Scoping opinions can be sought, in the following circumstances:
1) where environmental factors (or any elements) have been scoped out;
2) where sufficient uncertainty remains around any environmental factors scoped in; or
3) where methodologies and mitigation proposed are not clearly established practice.
NOTE 2
Obtaining a scoping opinion can promote an early and shared understanding between project teams,
the Overseeing Organisation or competent authority and authorities likely to be concerned by a project,
of the issues requiring further environmental assessment.
NOTE 3
Obtaining a scoping opinion can minimise delays later in the project life cycle.
4.2
The project shall agree the approach to consulting authorities likely to be concerned with the project,
with the Overseeing Organisation.
4.2.1
Projects may benefit from consulting other organisations to obtain information about local conditions or
views on survey methodology to supplement environmental factor guidance in LA 104 [Ref 7.N], LA
105 [Ref 1.N], LA 106 [Ref 3.N], LA 113 [Ref 11.N], LA 111 [Ref 10.N].
4.3
Where a scoping opinion has been obtained projects must base their environmental statement on that
opinion, in accordance with the 2014/52/EU [Ref 6.N].

a scoping opinion.
