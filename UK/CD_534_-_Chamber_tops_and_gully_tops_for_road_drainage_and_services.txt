Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the requirements for chamber tops and gully tops on motorway and all-purpose
trunk roads. This document can be read in conjunction with the RSTA Code of Practice for Ironwork
Systems Installation and Refurbishment RSTA CoP Ironwork [Ref 1.I].
To reduce the risks to both road users and maintenance staff, chamber tops are no longer permitted
within the carriageway of new construction and the need for existing chamber tops in the carriageway
should be assessed. By removing or reducing the number of chamber tops in the carriageway, this
reduces the need for lane closures and traffic management when carrying out routine inspection and
maintenance tasks.
The premature failure of chamber top and gully top installations as well as the failure of the chamber
itself and surrounding pavement surface can pose a risk to both maintenance operatives and road
users.
This document supersedes Highway Construction Details (HCD), F series, drawing F17.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 8.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard", or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with GG 101 [Ref 8.N].

Design for chamber tops and gully tops
General
2.1
New chamber tops shall not be installed in carriageways including hardstrips, hard shoulders and
central reserve crossovers of motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
2.2
Chamber tops shall be in accordance with BS EN 124-1 [Ref 6.N]and the requirements of this
document.
2.3
Gully tops shall be in accordance with BS EN 124:1994 (1994) [Ref 5.N] and the requirements of this
document.
2.4
Chamber tops with clear opening of greater than 1 m shall be in accordance with BS 9124 [Ref 11.N]
and the requirements of this document.
2.5
The minimum classification for all chamber tops and gully tops installed in areas of motorways and
all-purpose trunk roads that are at risk from trafficking, either directly or indirectly, shall be of grade
D400 in accordance with BS EN 124:1994 (1994) [Ref 5.N] .
2.6
Where the AADT LGV for a carriageway exceeds 1500 in each direction, grade E600 chamber tops
shall be specified.
2.7
Chamber tops shall have a minimum polished skid resistance value (PSRV) dependent on the risk
specific to their location as shown in Table 2.7.
Table 2.7 Minimum PSRV
Pendulum test
WRc test
Low risk
>45
>0.62 kN
High risk
>60
>0.83 kN
NOTE 1
Low-risk sites are those where the predominant use is by non-motorised users (NMU), such as
footways. High-risk sites are those where the predominant use is vehicular.
NOTE 2
Skid risk is defined in DMRB CS 228 [Ref 3.I].
NOTE 3
The pendulum test method to determine the skid resistance of the pavement surface or of plain
frictional covers (where no vertical or near vertical edges exceeding 1.5 mm are present) is to accord
with BS EN 13036-4 2011 [Ref 9.N].
2.7.1
Where the skid resistance of profiled covers (where vertical or near vertical edges exceeding 1.5 mm
are present) is measured in accordance with the WRc Skid Resistance Method (see UC 12974 [Ref
1.N]), the test should be undertaken by a UKAS-accredited test house.
NOTE 1
The PSRV value is derived from a comparison of the values of skid resistance of surface materials
tested using both the pendulum method and the WRc fixed-wheel method when inserted in the
equation in Appendix A.
NOTE 2
Appendix A contains a brief description of the trials undertaken to establish a comparison between the
two methods and an equation for determining the comparative PSRV.
2.8
The unpolished skid resistance value (USRV) is unrepresentative of the service condition and shall not
be used in the assessment of skid risk.
Chamber tops
2.9
A chamber top permitting access shall conform to the following minimum clear opening requirements:
1)
the minimum clear opening for a frame with a rectangular opening is not less than 600 mm with a
diagonal measurement of not less than 700 mm;

the minimum clear opening for a frame with a circular opening is a diametric measurement of not
less than 700 mm.
NOTE
The minimum cover dimensions where personnel access is not required are stated in BS EN 752 [Ref
3.N].
2.10
The frame of a chamber top shall be a minimum of 150 mm deep for installations in motorways and
all-purpose trunk roads.

NOTE
Failure of bedding materials due to concentrated loads from poor frame/bedding is a common cause of
premature failure of ironwork and a source of danger to road users. Such failures are caused by
inadequate distribution of loads from frames onto and through the bedding materials. This load
distribution is a complex issue and depends on the frame configuration at the supports, the frame
flange geometry and extent, the bedding material elastic modulus and the frame stiffness.
2.12
The depth of the insertion of the chamber top cover within the frame shall be no less than 50 mm, or no
less than 80 mm if the design relies upon the depth of insertion for security.
2.13
Types of loose couplings, other than bolts, shall be specified as having a minimum cross-sectional area
of 140 mm2.
Gully tops
2.14
Gully tops (frame and grating) shall be grade D400 in accordance with BS EN 124:1994 (1994) [Ref
5.N].
2.14.1
Hinged gratings may be either kerb-hinged or side-hinged appropriate to the direction of traffic.
2.14.2
Kerb-type gully gratings and frames should provide a kerbside water intake and an access which, if
hinged, opens away from the carriageway, that is, towards the kerb.
2.14.3
Weir depth should be 115 mm (Type 1) or 165 mm (Type 2) as defined by BS 7903 [Ref 4.N].
2.14.4
Kerb-type gully gratings and frames should be provided with a Type HB (half batter) profile in
accordance with BS EN 1340 [Ref 2.N] unless otherwise stated.
2.15
The critical dimensions of kerb-type gully gratings and frames shall be in accordance with BS 7903 [Ref
4.N].
2.16
Nominal widths of gratings and minimum areas of waterway shall be in accordance with BS EN
124:1994 (1994) [Ref 5.N]and BS 7903 [Ref 4.N].

A1
Test procedure
The skid resistance of pavement surface materials is measured using the Pendulum Test in accordance
with Annex B of BS EN 13036-4 2011 [Ref 9.N]. This is inappropriate for adequately assessing the skid
resistance of profiled surfaces such as those formed on chamber top covers.
WRc were commissioned in 2016 to devise a more appropriate test method for these raised surface
profiles and developed the locked wheel test described in their final report UC 12974 [Ref 1.N] of
February 2018 and summarised below.
The test is undertaken using a rig comprising of a support frame with a top to support the test sample.
A fixed wheel with a specific smooth tread tyre ASTM E1884 [Ref 4.I], and inflated to 2.76 bar (40 psi),
is mounted in a free moving frame. The tyre is placed on the test sample and a load of 70 kg is applied
to the wheel. The tyre is then drawn across the sample surface by means of a hand crank. The link
between the handle and the wheel contains a load cell that measures the peak force (in kN) which is
displayed on a force meter.
The test sample is thoroughly wetted prior to carrying out each test.
A2
Verification
A range of materials and chamber tops were subject to skid resistance tests using both the pendulum
test and the fixed wheel test.
The values obtained by each method were then compared to derive a formula that would enable a
direct comparison to be made.
The comparative formula is:
y = 2 + 70x
where x is the skid wheel peak force (in kN) and y is the polished skid resistance value measured using
the pendulum test.

Appendix B. Decision tree
a) The decision tree process applies to all access covers (whole or part) located in the carriageway
pavement including its hard shoulder and hardstrip(s) as defined in terms and definitions.
b) A 'simple chamber' is one that meets all the following criteria:
1)
no side connections, that is one incoming pipe and one outgoing pipe only;
2)
On removal of the chamber in question the resulting gap between adjacent remaining chambers
on the same drainage run is no greater than 200 m;
3)
difference in incoming and outgoing pipe diameter is no greater than 150 mm; and,
4)
The change in pipe direction is no greater than 22.5°.
c) In central reserves the full area of emergency crossover points are included even where a reduced
pavement structure is provided. Other hardened central reserve areas that do not have the full depth
pavement construction of the adjacent carriageway are excluded.
d) The Overseeing Organisation will discuss alternative solutions to achieve a consensus prior to the
submission of a DfS. The alternatives include:
1)
a plated & buried chamber retained under the pavement around bridge piers where existing
changes of direction provide pipe angles >22.5 degrees; and,
2)
a retained buried benched chamber within the central reserve, but with rodding eye for jetting
purposes.
e) Where reference is made to a location wholly between the wheel track zones within a running lane,
additionally the area between the wheel track zone and the carriageway edge line and its hard strip is
an equivalent area. For the purposes of this decision tree, the wheel track zone is a 900 mm-wide zone
(and not 600 mm-wide zone). If retaining an access cover within the entry and exit areas of junctions
(both main line and slip road) as the combined, and individually wider, wheel track zones are not as
simple as that described in CD 226 [Ref 2.I].
