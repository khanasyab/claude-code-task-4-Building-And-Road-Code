Introduction
Introduction
Background
Experience has shown that arch bridges are very durable structures and should require less
maintenance in comparison to other bridge forms. Prior to the publication of BD 91/04, there had not
been a standard covering the design of new unreinforced arch bridges.
BD 91/04 considered research into the behaviour of arch bridges that has been undertaken by a
number of organisations including Transport Research Laboratory, British Rail Research and a number
of universities. In BD 91/04, consideration was given to the results of most of this work. This research
included Melbourne & Gilbert 1995 [Ref 5.I], Mair 1995 [Ref 1.I], Choo & Hogg 1995 [Ref 3.I], Cox &
Halsall 1996 [Ref 2.I] and Owen, Peric, Petrinic, Brookes and James ( Owen et al 1998 [Ref 4.I]).
Maintenance requirements have significant effects on whole life costs. The financial benefits arising
from reduced maintenance requirements for unreinforced arch bridges should be considered when
comparing the whole life costs of arch bridges with other types of bridges.
This document states the design requirements for arch bridges. It complements the masonry and
associated work requirements for unreinforced masonry arch bridges, referred to hereafter as 'arch
bridges', in CC 491 [Ref 2.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 15.N] apply to this document.

the ultimate and serviceability limit states.
NOTE 1
Requirements for the ultimate and serviceability limit states are given in Section 4.

structure or services.
NOTE 3
SLS includes the condition beyond which there is a loss of utility including the following;
1)
deformation of the structure causing a loss of utility or adversely affecting its appearance to a
point where public concern could be expected; and
2)
cracks become of such magnitude as to lead to a reduction in structural integrity.

The LM1 and LM2 load models in BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 8.N] do not satisfactorily model the effect of
normal vehicles on masonry arches.
NOTE 2
The contingency factor accounts for future increases in traffic loads of up to 10%.
3.10
The requirements for abnormal traffic loading shall be recorded in the AIP.
NOTE
Recommendations for abnormal loads for different types of highway are given in CD 350 [Ref 18.N].
3.11
Where abnormal traffic loads are required, characteristic actions shall be determined in accordance
with load model LM3 in BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 8.N].
3.12
Normal traffic associated with the LM3 load models shall be represented by AW vehicle loading in
accordance with ALL model 1 given in CS 454 [Ref 1.N] multiplied by a contingency factor of 1.1.
3.13
The impact factor shall be taken as 1.0 for the normal traffic in any lane occupied or straddled by the
SV or SOV load model.
3.14
Only one SV load model shall be applied on any one superstructure.
3.15
SV load models shall be applied in their entirety and not truncated.
3.16
The SV load model shall be placed at any transverse position on the carriageway, with its side parallel
to the kerb at the most unfavourable position to produce the most severe overall effect, either:
1)
wholly within one notional lane; or,
2)
straddling between two adjacent lanes.
NOTE
Typical examples of application of SV load model and AW vehicle loading are shown in Figures 3.16Na
and 3.16Nb. Figure 3.16Na shows the case of the SV load model fitting in one lane and Figure 3.16Nb
shows the case where it straddles lanes.

Design and resistances
General
4.1
The design of the arch bridge and its components shall be verified for the effects of the following:
1)
permanent actions;
2)
all possible combinations of variable actions; and,
3)
accidental actions.
4.1.1
The structure may be analysed using any appropriate analytical model or computer program that
captures the critical behaviours and failure modes for the arch structure.
NOTE
It has been shown by Melbourne & Gilbert 1995 [Ref 5.I]that ring separation can significantly reduce
strength. However, in some cases, notably in skew arches, bonding the rings together can be difficult
and significantly increase costs.
4.2
For bridges with a span/rise ratio greater than 6, the analytical model shall consider the flexibility of the
arch ring and supports (abutments and piers) together with the effects of creep, shrinkage and
temperature.
Materials
Masonry strength and properties
4.3
The characteristic compressive strength of masonry fk shall be determined in accordance with BS EN
1996 [Ref 11.N].
4.3.1
In the absence of more accurate determination, the short term elastic modulus of masonry may be
taken as 900 · fk .
4.3.2
In the absence of more accurate determination, the creep factor and shrinkage strain may be taken
from Table 4.3.2.

ground strength parameters in two combinations, denoted Combination 1 and Combination 2.
Combination 1 and Combination 2 can be critical for different aspects of the same verification.
Note 2: The effect of the overload factor is already accounted for in the values of the partial factors.
Note 3: The set of partial factors from BS EN 1990 [Ref 13.N] for Combination 1 or Combination 2 is
defined in BS EN 1997-1 [Ref 12.N] Design Approach 1. Further guidance is provided in PD 6694-1
[Ref 16.N].
Note 4: The set of partial factors for the EQU limit state is defined in BS EN 1990 [Ref 13.N].
Note 5: See Section 4 - If an SLS verification is not undertaken the greater partial factors are
applicable.
