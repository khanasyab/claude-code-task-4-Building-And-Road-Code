Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Highways England specific requirements for the provision of
traffic signs to tourist destinations and leisure facilities in England on motorways and all-purpose trunk
roads.
As there is only a limited quantity of information that can be safely read by road users, priority for tourist
and leisure signing on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network is given to tourist destinations
and leisure facilities with the greatest traffic management and/or safety needs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
This document is intended to be read by professionals who understand traffic sign design.
This document should be read in conjunction with:
1) The Traffic Sign Regulations and General Directions ( TSRGD SI2016 No.362 [Ref 7.N]);
2) Chapter 7 of the Traffic Signs Manual ( TSM Chapter 7 [Ref 9.N]); and
3) Local Transport Note 1/94 ( LTN 1/94 [Ref 4.N]).

criteria apply:
1) the exhibition qualifies as an eligible tourist destination; and
2) the exhibition is recognised by VE as being of regional or national importance in horticultural or
arboricultural terms.
E/2.16
National parks and geographical areas shall apply for tourist signing only where each of the following
criteria apply:
1) traffic is routed to a permanently established tourist information centre;
2) the name appears on maps and atlases; and
3) the area has signed boundaries.
E/2.16.1
A national park or geographical area may apply for tourist signing if it contains a settlement which has a
permanently established tourist information centre.
NOTE 1
An example of a national park or geographical area that can apply for tourist signing is Swaledale, in
which Richmond is situated, and Richmond contains a permanently established TIC. Tourist signing is
expected to state "Swaledale and Richmond".
NOTE 2
A geographical area is one marketed under a collective theme, e.g. literary or historical connections.
Requirements for accommodating tourist and leisure signs
E/2.17
Tourist and leisure signs shall be allowed only where they can be safely accommodated at the roadside.
NOTE 1
It is not always possible to accommodate tourist and leisure signs because of physical constraints or
the number of other destinations requiring signing in the area, which can include regional destinations
or other tourist destinations or leisure facilities.

NOTE 2
The TSRGD S.I. No. 362 [Ref 6.N] defines the maximum number of destinations that are permitted to
be included on specific types of tourist and leisure signs.
E/2.18
Where more than the maximum number of qualifying tourist destinations or leisure facilities seek
signing from a particular junction and each of them has an equal traffic management and safety need,
the applicant shall consult with the owner of this document.
NOTE
The owner of this document can consult with the HHA and VE to determine which of the tourist
destinations and leisure facilities with equal traffic management and safety needs is signed.

E/3. Tourist and leisure signs
E/3.
Tourist and leisure signs
Information to be included on signs
E/3.1
Tourist and leisure signs on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network shall use legends, colours
and symbols consistent with continuity signs located (or to be located) on the local road network.
NOTE
Tourist and leisure signs are not permitted on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network if they
are not consistent with continuity signs or not aligned to TSRGD SI2016 No.362 [Ref 7.N].
E/3.2
Tourist and leisure signs shall direct road users to parking facilities rather than to the tourist destination
or leisure facility itself.
E/3.3
Tourist signs for permanent garden exhibitions shall state only the name of the exhibition.
E/3.4
Unless there is no capacity to sign destinations of the same type (e.g. museums) individually on one
sign, destinations of the same type shall be signed individually if the routes to them separate.
NOTE 1
Where multiple destinations of the same type are eligible for signing on the approach to a junction and
there is no capacity to sign them all individually, a generic or a plural term, e.g. 'museums' is used.
NOTE 2
Where a number of eligible tourist destinations and leisure facilities are located in a place or
geographical area, the use of collective signing can be beneficial (see Figure E/3.4N2).
Figure E/3.4N2 Example of collective tourist signing
E/3.5
A descriptive legend shall not be shown on any part of collective signs.
NOTE
An example of a descriptive legend is a historic market town.
E/3.5.1
Leisure facilities may be shown on collective signs with the exception of:
1) light refreshment facilities;
2) restaurants;
3) picnic areas; and
4) hotels or other overnight accommodation.
E/3.6
Where a tourist destination or leisure facility symbol prescribed in TSRGD S.I. No. 362 [Ref 6.N] is
suitable for the type of destination to be signed, the prescribed symbol shall be used.
NOTE 1
Prescribed symbols are easily recognisable by road users.
NOTE 2
Reduction of the overall size of tourist and leisure signs is achieved by using a symbol with a tourist
destination or leisure facility name on the first sign and then using only the symbol on the continuity
signs.
NOTE 3
The design of continuity signs placed on a route after the point at which the destination associated with
the symbol has already been established makes the destination clear to road users.

E/3. Tourist and leisure signs
NOTE 4
Where it is intended to show the destination name on all of the signs, the omission of the symbol can
minimise sign information overload.
Sign continuity
E/3.7
There shall be continuity of signing from the furthest sign to the destination.
E/3.8
Where a tourist destination or leisure facility is accessed from the local road network, it shall only be
signed from the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network if continuity signing has been or can be
provided on the local road network between the trunk road and the tourist destination or leisure facility.
E/3.8.1
Tourist and leisure signing should not extend more than 3 miles from the tourist destination or leisure
facility (the 3 miles being that travelled by the road user from the first junction that is signed to the
destination).
E/3.9
The distance between the tourist destination or leisure facility and the furthest tourist and leisure sign
shall be determined by traffic management needs, where the tourist destination or leisure facility is:
1) located in a settlement of fewer than 10,000 people; and
2) receiving more than double the number of visitors specified in Table E/2.9.

E/5.
Tourist information points (TIPs) and signing for tourist
information centres (TICs)
E/5.1
TIPs shall not be signed from motorways or all-purpose trunk roads.
E/5.2
TICs shall be eligible for tourist signing from motorways and all-purpose trunk roads, provided that:
1) parking capacity is available at the TIC or nearby within 250m; and
2) information on nearby accommodation is available outside of opening hours.
NOTE 1
TICs have the potential to direct road users to a range of regional tourist destinations and leisure
facilities, which offers benefits in terms of traffic management and safety and the economic
development of tourism and leisure facilities in an area.
NOTE 2
The "i" symbol in Figure E/5.3 is always associated with a TIC.
E/5.3
Where prescribed by TSRGD SI2016 No.362 [Ref 7.N] initial signs to TICs shall display the legend
'Tourist information centre' and the associated "i" symbol as shown in Figure E/5.3.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Transport Scotland specific requirements for the provision of
traffic signs to tourist destinations and leisure facilities on motorways and trunk roads.
As there is only a limited quantity of information that can be safely read by road users, priority for tourist
and leisure signing on the motorway and trunk road network is given to tourist destinations and leisure
facilities with the greatest traffic management and/or safety needs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the Welsh Government specific requirements for the provision of
traffic signs to tourist destinations and leisure facilities on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
As there is only a limited quantity of information that can be safely read by road users, priority for tourist
and leisure signing on the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network is given to tourist destinations
and leisure facilities with the greatest traffic management and/or safety needs.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
This document is intended to be read by professionals who understand traffic sign design.
This document should be read in conjunction with:
1) The Traffic Sign Regulations and General Directions 2016 ( TSRGD SI2016 No.362 [Ref 3.N]);
2) Chapter 7 of the Traffic Signs Manual ( TSM Chapter 7 [Ref 5.N]); and
3) Local Transport Note 1/94 ( LTN 1/94 [Ref 2.N]).
