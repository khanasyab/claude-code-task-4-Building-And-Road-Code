CM 125 Revision 1
Introduction
Introduction
Background
Requirements and advice for the inspection, maintenance and disposal of traffic signs are defined in
this document, CS 125 [Ref 2.N] and CZ 125 [Ref 1.N].
Traffic signs facilitate the safe use and effective operation of the highway by communicating directions,
warnings, regulations and other information to road users. Inspection, maintenance and disposal of
traffic signs are necessary because:
1) traffic signs are subject to legislation and their legal status, or that of an associated statutory
provision, can be affected if there is a failure in the performance of a traffic sign or associated
equipment;
2) over-provision of traffic signs can have a negative visual impact on the environment and can have a
detrimental impact on comprehension by road users where there is an overload of information;
3) the visual performance of traffic signs reduces during the hours of darkness and degrades over time,
reducing conspicuity and legibility;
4) impairment of the visibility and legibility of traffic signs can be detrimental to road safety by
distracting road users and/or hindering drivers' uptake of vital information;
5) deterioration of supporting structures and electrical installations can occur, potentially becoming
hazardous to road users, road workers and/or other parties;
6) rectification of defects and preventive maintenance are key to a traffic sign installation achieving its
design life.
Further guidance on the reasons for inspecting, maintaining and disposing of traffic signs can be found
in sections 8 and 9 of TSM Chapter 1 [Ref 5.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

3.1
Each traffic sign shall be cleaned at a frequency that is commensurate with the rate at which dirt and

(i.e. on gantries)
6 years
Other traffic signs
3 years
3.1.2
Traffic signs should be cleaned more frequently than identified in Table 3.1.1 where they are
susceptible to an increased build-up of vegetation or dirt on the traffic sign face.
NOTE
