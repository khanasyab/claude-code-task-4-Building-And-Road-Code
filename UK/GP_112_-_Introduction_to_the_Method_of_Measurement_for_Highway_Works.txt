Definitions
1.1
In this and associated documents collectively entitled Method of Measurement for Highway Works
(hereinafter referred to as "the Method of Measurement") unless the context otherwise requires, the
following words and expressions shall have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is
to say:
a)
"Conditions of Contract" means the Conditions of Contract referred to in the Tender;
b)
words and expressions to which meanings are assigned in the specification and contract
drawings have the same meanings in the Method of Measurement;
c)
"Bill of Quantities" means a list of items giving brief identifying descriptions and estimated
quantities of work comprised in the execution of the works to be performed;
d)
items designated "Provisional" are items for which the quantities of work to be executed cannot
be determined with the same degree of accuracy as other items but for which it is deemed
necessary to make provision;
e)
"Preliminary Item" means an item in respect of indirect works, project overheads, general
obligations and risks antecedent to or involved in the execution of the Contract and which is set
out in a "Preliminaries" section of the Bill of Quantities;
f)
"Finishings" means the miscellaneous surfacings, furniture and ancillary features that are added
to any part of a structure;
g)
"Existing Ground Level" means the level of the ground before any work under the Contract is
carried out;
h)
"Hard Material" means the following:
1)
material so designated in the Preambles to Bill of Quantities; and/or
2)
material which requires the use of blasting, breakers or splitters for its removal but
excluding individual masses less than 0.20 cubic metres;
i)
"Type of Pavement" means one of the following designs of pavement:
1)
flexible pavement construction;
2)
flexible composite pavement construction;
3)
rigid pavement construction;
4)
rigid composite pavement construction;
j)
"Designated Outline" means the designated outline shown on the Drawings.
Note a
A Designated Outline is shown as enclosing each structure (including drainage structures) to be
designed by the Contractor and each structure for which a choice of designs is offered. The
Designated Outline delineates the limits of measurement of work to be included for each structure (with
the exception of those works scheduled as not to be included).
Note b
selection of the Designated Outlines on the Drawings should be carefully considered by the Overseeing
Organisation. Each Outline should be sufficiently large to include the Overseeing Organisation's
non-proprietary design and all the possible options the Contractor may put forward in accordance with
the design specification. The main requirement for the Designated Outline is that it should be clearly
defined and fully enclosing.
Note c
The Designated Outline should exclude common items such as pavements, kerbing, safety barriers,
service ducts, cables, headwalls and the like. Where these features cannot be excluded from the
Designated Outline a schedule should be provided to list the features which pass through or into the
Designated Outline but which are to be excluded from the lump sum item and included in the
Roadworks or other Bill. Such items should not include integral parts of the structure to be designed.
The extent of the work excluded from the lump sum item should be clearly shown and scheduled.
Note d
Any alterations or variations to the Works outside Designated Outlines or to existing works as a
consequence of the Contractor's designs are not to be included in any admeasurement. See clause
2.26 of GP 113 [Ref 2.N].

General principles
Method of Measurement
Note
The Method of Measurement is intended for use for highway contracts with any form of contract.
Amendments to the Method of Measurement
Note a
Amendments may be required for particular contract conditions. Additions or amendments to the
Specification for Highway Works which are not adequately covered by the Method of Measurement will
necessitate amendment to suit. Provision is made in GP 113/MMHW [Ref 2.N] - Preambles to Bill of
Quantities, "Amendments to the Method of Measurement" to accommodate such amendments.
Note b
Refer to GC 101 [Ref 1.N] 'Introduction to the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges' for details of the
Overseeing Organisation's requirements regarding Departures from Standards.
Bill of Quantities
2.1
In the Bill of Quantities the sub-headings and item descriptions identify the work covered by the
respective items read in conjunction with the matters listed under "Item coverage" within the Method of
Measurement, GP 113/MMHW [Ref 2.N] Preambles to Bill of Quantities and amendments. The nature
and extent of the work to be performed shall be ascertained by reference to the drawings, specification
and Conditions of Contract.
Itemisation - Groups and features
2.2
Each item description is to be consistent with and shall be compounded from one or more of the groups
listed under "Itemisation" within the Method of Measurement incorporating amendments introduced in
the Preambles to the Bill of Quantities.
2.3
An item description can contain features from as many groups as necessary to identify the work
required, but shall include only one feature from any one group.
Items in the Bill of Quantities
2.4
The Bill of Quantities, unless expressly stated otherwise in the Contract, shall contain all those items
compounded in accordance with the foregoing clauses 2.2 and 2.3 of this document required to
comprise the Works (apart from Provisional sums where required).
Item coverage
Note
Item coverages in the MMHW ensure that the Contractor knows the items of work to be covered by the
rates and prices inserted against items in the Bill of Quantities. Coverages relative to the base item
description are not normally included, for example cement in concrete, nor are those contingently and
indispensably necessary to enable the work item to be completed satisfactorily, for example nuts and
bolts in safety barriers.
Extra over items
Note
Extra Over (EO) items shown in the MMHW are applied to a base item where a significant additional
burden is placed upon the Contractor to undertake extra work of much the same nature as the work
covered by the base item. The quantities to be billed for the EO items must be in respect of work
included with the quantities for the base item. The item coverage in respect of the quantities for the EO
item comprises a summation of that for the base item and the EO item.
Remove from store and re-erect/re-install/relay
Note a
The items for remove from store and re-erect, re-install, relay include items which have been removed
to store off Site designated by the Overseeing Organisation and items which have been set aside by
the Contractor as required by the Contract.
Note b
The item coverage applicable to removing from store and re-erecting/reinstalling/relaying various
materials includes for modification and new materials to the extent that the requirements are detailed in
the Contract. Modification and new materials of which the Contractor was not informed at the time of
tender are not covered by this item coverage.

2. General principles
Hard Material
Note
Excavation in Hard Material occurs in the item coverage for several items of work, for example, kerbs
footways and paved areas, traffic signs and road markings, road lighting and electrical work. The
Contract should contain information known to the compiler about the existence and extent of Hard
Material and this should include existing buried roads and the like. This would not relieve the Contractor
of their obligations under the Conditions of Contract. Hard Material is measured extra over normal
excavation for earthworks, fencing and drainage and guidance is given under CC 601/MMHW [Ref 3.N].
Dayworks
Note
The provision of dayworks items is to be addressed within the Conditions of Contract.
Accommodation works and works for utility services and supplies
2.5
The measurement of accommodation works and works for utility services and supplies shall be in
accordance with the various methods of measurement collectively entitled the Method of Measurement.
Provisional sums
2.6
Where Provisional sums are to be included in the Bill of Quantities they shall be allocated to a particular
construction heading and measured within the Method of Measurement.
2.7
Where it is not possible to include Provisional sums within corresponding measurement sections they
shall be included under a separate division within the Bill of Quantities in accordance with clause 1.27
of GP 113 [Ref 2.N].
Prime cost items
Note
The provision of prime cost items is to be addressed within the Conditions of Contract.
