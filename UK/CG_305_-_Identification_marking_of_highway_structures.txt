Siting of identification markers
Permission
3.1
Where a structure is not owned by the Overseeing Organisation, written agreement to the placement
and siting of identification markings shall be obtained from asset owners beforehand, and filed in
accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's records procedures.
Structures adjacent to the carriageway
3.2
Where structures are adjacent to the carriageway, identification markers shall be placed in a prominent
and visible location on structures so that they are in a convenient position for maintenance and
inspection purposes.
NOTE
Locations of identification markers on structures are illustrated in Appendix A.
3.2.1
On single carriageways, one identification marker should be placed adjacent to the lane carrying traffic
in the direction of increasing road kilometerage.
3.2.2
On dual carriageways, two identification markers should be placed on the structure; one adjacent to
each side of the carriageway.
3.2.3
At intersections of motorways and / or trunk roads, identification markers should be placed on the
structure in positions relative to both roads.
3.2.4
On long viaducts, such as the Midland Links viaduct, identification markings should be placed on both
the superstructure and individual substructures.
3.2.5
Where vandalism is likely to be a problem, identification markers should be placed at 3m minimum
height above the carriageway level.
3.2.6
For overbridges, identification markers should be placed on piers or abutments facing the carriageway
1m above either the top of the safety fence or the carriageway level, whichever is higher, as illustrated
in Appendix A1.1.
3.2.7
For overbridges going over a secondary road, identification markers should be marked on the structure
adjacent to the secondary road, on parapet plinths or on top of copings, as illustrated in Appendix A1.1.
3.2.8
For underbridges with concrete or brick parapets, identification markers should be placed on the
parapet facing the carriageway, at the approach end, as illustrated in Appendix A1.2.
3.2.9
For underbridges going under a secondary road, identification markers should be marked on the
structure adjacent to the secondary road, on wing wall tops.
3.2.10
On underbridges with metal parapets, identification markers should be placed on the concrete plinths
between first and second posts, at the approach end, as illustrated in Appendix A1.2
3.2.11
For culverts, identification markers should be placed at the end of the retaining wall adjacent to the
culvert where this can be safely achieved, as illustrated in Appendix A1.3.
3.2.12
For signal gantries, identification markers should be placed facing the carriageway on the support, as
illustrated in Appendix A1.4.
3.2.13
On retaining walls, including gabion walls, identification markers should be placed adjacent to the
carriageway, at the approach end, facing the road, as illustrated in Appendix A1.5.
3.2.14
For gabion walls, identification markers should be applied to a suitably sized board and attached to the
gabion cages e.g. by galvanised twisted wire.
3.2.15

3. Siting of identification markers
Structures remote from the carriageway
3.3
Where structures are remote from the carriageway, identification markers shall be positioned for
maintenance and inspection purposes.
NOTE
This can allow smaller characters to be used if the marker is intended to be read at close quarters.
3.3.1
Where retaining walls are positioned at the bottom of embankments, identification markers should be
marked either on top of the wall or at the end of the wall, as illustrated in Appendix A1.3.
3.3.2
For culverts, identification markers should be placed on top of the wall, as illustrated in Appendix A1.3.
Health and safety
3.4
The proposed location of the identification marker must be subject to a site specific risk assessment,
including aspects involving the initial provision and subsequent maintenance operations.
NOTE
In writing the advice clauses on suitable locations for identification markers in section 3, it is not
possible to predict or know all the possible situations and risks involved in achieving the placement
requirements. The development of a risk assessment has been set as a minimum safety provision to
ensure each proposed location for an identification marker is subject to a site specific risk assessment
prior to any painting or maintenance of identification markers being undertaken.

E/1.
References for identification markers on structures in England
E/1.1
The reference shall be developed for the structure to be marked.
E/1.1.1
The early notification process should be followed to establish the structure number and then the
reference, using the following definition of structure number elements in these NOTEs.
NOTE 1
The structure number, as given in the structures management information system (SMIS), is made up
of the following elements [ a ] 00 / [ b ] X 000 (X) / [ c ] ? / [ d ] 00. 000 [ e ] X [ f ] ?:
1) [ a ] Junction number: motorway junction number if appropriate [e.g. 19];
2) [ b ] Road: road title in the form as known by the normal road user [for examples M55, A1(M), A38
but not A43(T)].
3) [ c ] Slip road (designator): for structures at interchanges of roads which are not situated on either
interchange road;
4) [ d ] Kilometerage: preceding kilometerage (0.1 km) marker post for motorways with marker posts or
the equivalent for other motorways and trunk roads [e.g. 165.3];
5) [ e ] Type tag: e.g. 'Q' for culverts, 'R' for retaining walls, 'S' for sign/signal gantry or 'A', 'B' etc. for
widened bridges;
6) [ f ] Individual structure type: to distinguish between structures within the same marker posts or
within 0.1 kilometres of each other or for widened structures other than bridges which have been
split into smaller sections [e.g. 1,2,3 etc.].
NOTE 2
Elements d, e and f are to be used when establishing the reference to be allocated to structures.
E/1.2
The bridge reference shall include the road over as a prefix to assist in identification from the road
under e.g. A35/165 3.
NOTE
In this example, A35 is not element [b] but instead the road going over or under the structure.
E/1.2.1
Where two or more structures share a common kilometerage value, the structure suffixes should be
included with the reference e.g. 165 3/S5 where S = sign/signal gantry, 5 = the sixth structure
referenced 165 3 (the first being 0).
NOTE
In this example, elements [d], [e] and [f] are used and taken from SMIS.
E/1.2.2
At intersections of motorways and/or trunk roads the structure reference should be derived from the
kilometerage of the road carrying traffic over.
E/1.2.3
Where several structures are grouped within an interchange they should:
1) have the road identifier and structure suffix included; and,
2) share the intersection kilometerage
NOTE
e.g. A35/165 3/S5

Introduction
All Welsh Government maintainable structures are uniquely numbered using a system designed to give
an indication of the location and type of structure.
Structures are referenced to the road number for which they provide their function, this will include
structures supporting or crossing the road.
Where two "A" trunk road or motorways cross, the number will be referenced to the structure carrying
the road. All numbers are based on the centre point of the structure.
Bridges and footbridges are used as the benchmarks from which all other structures are referenced.
W/A2
'A' trunk road structures
W/A2.1
Bridges on "A" trunk roads
Bridges are numbered sequentially along the roads and use a two part number consisting of the road
number and the sequential number (originally incremented by 10).
Table W/A.1 Bridge
Road number
Space
Sequential number
A40
10
Displayed as: A40 10
When adding new structures these will inevitably be located between existing structures and will
require numbers other than 10's to be used. The new numbering should be in accordance with the
downlink to uplink direction. Any number between 1 and 9 can be used but consideration should be
given to the proximity of the adjacent structures. As an example, A 40 15 would be appropriate for a
new structure half way between the A40 10 and the uplink bridge or footbridge, A40 12 if closer to A40
10 and A40 17 if closer to the uplink.
W/A2.2
Fotbridges on "A" trunk roads
Footbridges, like bridges, are numbered sequentially along the roads using the same numbering with
the addition of a suffix "F".

W/A2.2.1
Other structures on "A" trunk roads
Other structure types with suffixes as shown in table W/A.3 are identified by the percentage of the
distance travelled up-chainage between sequential bridges (or footbridges).

Bridges within motorway junctions
For the purposes of structure numbering the motorway junction is defined as the area between the
points the slip road joins or leaves the main carriageway on the downlink side to the points the slip road
joins or leaves the main carriageway on the uplink side. All structures falling within this area use the
junction as both downlink and uplink in the number and the % distance is replaced by an incremental
number which bears no relation to the position.
