Introduction
Introduction
Background
Good landscape design integrates new and existing roads into the landscape, minimises adverse
impact on setting, maximises design quality and strengthens sense of place for those on and off the
road.
Development of this document has been influenced by:
1)
the UK Government's commitment in ratification of the European Landscape Convention ELC
2000 [Ref 7.N] (hereafter referred to as the Convention), to recognising landscape matters in law,
and promoting landscape planning, protection, and management policies;
2)
the Convention's ELC 2000 [Ref 7.N] widely adopted definition of landscape which recognises:
a)
landscape as a resource inclusive of townscape;
b)
the relationship between people and place; and
c)
all landscapes as important irrespective of their location (i.e. seascapes, rural, urban, and
peri-urban areas) or condition (i.e. natural, outstanding or ordinary).
This document aligns with Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU EIA Directive 2014/52/EU
[Ref 1.N], as transposed into UK law.
The environmental function codes, landscape element codes, and environmental element codes for
masterplans are included within this document.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] apply to this document.

Character area
A geographical area that can be recognised as distinct from its adjacent
areas due to variations in components and activities, and the way in
which these are typically perceived.
NOTE 1: The alignment of a character area's boundary is determined
independently of administrative and property boundaries and may
overlap these where the landscape's character, characteristics, or
individual features, causes it to do so.
NOTE 2: Refer to GLVIA Third Edition [Ref 2.I] for more guidance on
understanding landscape character.
Design excellence

in respect of auditory amenity, biodiversity, and water quality.
Environmental function
Identifies and states the purpose of different features and their physical
nature to design and manage a road network, i.e. why they are there
and the intention for achieving them.
NOTE: Used to attach environmental objectives to engineering, and
other built elements, to influence their design and/or operational
maintenance.
Good road design
Good road design is inclusive, resilient and sustainable that aims to put
people at its heart; appreciated for its usefulness, and elegance in its
design reflecting the beauty of the natural, built and historic environment
through which it passes, enhancing it where reasonably possible.

2. Principles and purpose
2.
Principles and purpose
Approach to design
2.1
The principles of good road design established within GG 103 [Ref 5.N] shall be applied and
complement the general principles of design excellence, such that the overall design:
1)
maximises benefits above and beyond a compliance with minimum requirements;
2)
is context-specific in its response to landscape;
3)
incorporates landscape design and whole-life cost; and
4)
encompasses landscape design components, including biodiversity, heritage, acoustics, water
management, and public access requirements, .
2.2
Maintaining and, where possible, enhancing landscape quality shall form part of all good road design
and be measured by how well the design serves those who use it, those who live, work and enjoy the
land alongside it, and the landscape through which it passes.
NOTE
Landscape quality is fundamental to the design process throughout the design life-cycle and plays an
important role in the overall cost and whole-life cost of a project.
2.3
Good road design shall create opportunities to conserve and enhance the landscape and is measured
by the design's response(s) to:
1)
reflect and respect people's needs;
2)
provide or incorporate a sense of place (place-making);
3)
be robust, buildable, functional, operational, and maintainable;
4)
manage and minimise landscape disturbances and the damage from both temporary and
permanent works;
5)
climate change and its challenges;
6)
be flexible, sustainable (including and minimising waste) - whole-life cost; and
7)
deliver environmental gains.
2.4
A landscape strategy and a set of landscape objectives shall be developed to inform any landscape
design.
2.4.1
The landscape strategy and landscape objectives should:
1)
inform and be informed by the wider design strategy;
2)
be delivered by the design solutions presented in the environmental / landscape masterplan; and
3)
encourage design excellence and design quality that is sensitive to and integrates the road into
the local context.
NOTE 1
The requirements of the Overseeing Organisation apply. Refer to the National Application Annex where
applicable.
NOTE 2
The development of a landscape strategy involves the collation of opportunities, constraints, and risks
related to the landscape design and the design solutions necessary to meet need and maximise
benefits, and explains, spatially, how these fit together.
NOTE 3
Landscape objectives enforce the landscape strategy (and are derived from it) by stating what needs to
be achieved, and where.
2.5
The landscape strategy and landscape objectives shall lead to designs that:
1)
maintain consistency with the adjacent and surrounding landscape as necessary to avoid a
reduction in landscape quality;
2)
raise landscape quality and strengthen sense of place where proportionate opportunities exist to
do so; and

2. Principles and purpose
3)
take advantage of opportunities to create new places through design where this would be of
benefit to the design context.
NOTE
The nature of the transition between character areas is as important to the sense of place as the
strength of character within those areas.
2.6
The landscape strategy shall identify the spatial extent of landscape design required to manage and
minimise the impact of the temporary and permanent works, and to protect:
1)
the landscape's natural beauty, its importance and sensitivity;
2)
the landscape's views and visual amenity;
3)
the built and historic landscape through which a road passes; and
4)
existing features while providing driver interest and sense of place.
2.7
The landscape strategy and landscape objectives shall be applied throughout the design process to
provide consistency and continuity to decision making and site-specific designs that reflect and respect
the landscape's character.
2.7.1
Excellence in landscape design should be:
1)
adaptable (long lasting);
2)
collaborative;
3)
inclusive (respect places, people's needs, and views);
4)
innovative (respond to opportunities for change);
5)
appropriately detailed;
6)
sustainable and minimise waste; and
7)
designed to provide environmental gains.
Reporting landscape design
2.8
The multi-disciplinary approach to good road design shall be documented in the overall design strategy.
2.9
Landscape design including the design response to landscape character, and site-specific constraints
and opportunities shall be documented in the landscape strategy.
2.9.1
The landscape strategy should include the landscape objectives defined for the scheme.
2.9.2
The environmental and landscape design should be presented in the masterplan.
NOTE
The requirements of the Overseeing Organisation apply, refer to the National Application Annex where
applicable.
2.10
The environmental and landscape commitments shall be documented in the environmental
management plan within LA 120 [Ref 3.N].

3.2
The landscape design shall align with GG 103 [Ref 5.N] and maintain or, where the proportionate
opportunity exists, enhance landscape quality by demonstrating:
1)
protection and enhancement of the local environment;
2)
sensitivity to the local context and its numerous, and sometimes complex combinations of
landscape elements such as fields, woodlands, water bodies, hedges (and other boundaries),
pathways, streets, buildings and settlements;
3)
the creation of new views and the protection of existing views along the road to sustain visual
interest and maximise sense of place;
4)
the integration of footpaths, bridleways and side roads into the landscape to minimise severance;
5)
the integration of roadside barriers, fences and walls with their surroundings;
6)
high quality structure designs that respect the local landscape character;
7)
measures to retain and enhance tranquillity and/or wildness;
8)
sensitivity to 'dark skies' areas, minimising adverse environmental impacts and the intrusion
caused by lighting;
9)
the reflection and integration of the surrounding pattern and species grouping in any new planting;
10)
the reflection and integration of enhancement opportunities to biodiversity;
11)
the safeguarding of individual trees/woodland, and other ecological interests; and
12)
place-making and the protection and enhancement of the surrounding historic and/or urban
environment.
NOTE
For the design of highways structures reference is made to CD 351 [Ref 3.I] The design and
appearance of highway structures.
3.3
Where the design is required to make choices regarding the road alignment, good road design shall be
applied to enhance integration with the surrounding landscape and environment and to avoid or
minimise:
1)
intrusion into undisturbed, high-quality landscapes;
2)
intrusion into views from nearby property and public places;
3)
intrusive embankments crossing valleys and low-lying land;
4)
cuttings that create notches on the skyline or scars on hillsides and sidelong ground;
5)
junctions that are, by siting or design, unsympathetic to their landscape setting;
6)
land take required for large landscape earthworks affecting heritage and nature conservation
sites;
7)
changes to drainage regimes; and
8)
unsympathetic and intrusive side road crossings.
3.4
Good road design shall integrate a road into the surrounding landscape, through its response to the
landscape character context, to avoid harm to its setting.
3.4.1
Designs should be aligned with the existing landform to minimise earthwork requirements and help
achieve a cut-and-fill balance.
3.4.2
Designs should provide a balance between concealing the road and allowing for distinctive views out,
highlighting important features (such as landmark structures or striking natural features).
3.4.3
The interrelationship of landscape design with road-corridor elements forms an important part of
landscape quality in good road design and should create opportunities for providing or improving upon
the sense of place, for those on the road and in the wider landscape.

3. Design objectives
3.4.4
The coordination of road-corridor elements in good road design and their alignment with the
surrounding landscape characteristics should integrate a road with its surroundings and minimise its
adverse impact on setting.
3.4.5
The landscape strategy should be used to reduce the linearity of the road, to reduce severance of the
receiving landscape pattern and mitigate the adverse impacts upon landscape character that occur as
a result.
NOTE
The component parts of landscape including earthworks, planting, street furniture, and paved areas
can be presented to identify the principles for the landscape strategy.
3.5
The landscape strategy shall identify opportunities where present to improve, expand, connect, and
create green infrastructure assets and deliver benefits to people, nature, and natural processes.
3.5.1
The landscape strategy should identify opportunities to retain existing and established habitats and
areas of planting.
3.6
The landscape strategy shall identify the important, sensitive and vulnerable trees that are to be
protected in accordance with BS 5837 [Ref 4.I].
3.6.1
The landscape strategy should identify opportunities to provide native habitat buffers around ancient
woodlands and to connect them to each other and to other existing and new native woodlands.
3.6.2
Where ancient and veteran trees have been identified the design should be developed to
accommodate root protection areas of a sufficient size to protect those trees.
NOTE 1
A root protection area of 15 x the stem diameter measured at 1.3 m above ground level is
recommended for ancient and veteran trees.
NOTE 2
In addition to their value as habitats, trees and woodlands can be important due to their cultural value
and as components of the wider landscape setting and visual amenity.
NOTE 3
Where the design seeks to form connections to sensitive habitats, such as ancient woodland, it is
important to minimise the risk of invasive or otherwise harmful species entering those habitats.
3.7
The landscape strategy and landscape objectives shall identify design solutions to avoid, mitigate or
minimise all adverse impacts.
Landscape design
3.8
The landscape design shall be collaborative and deliver the landscape strategy and landscape
objectives.
3.8.1
Design requirements may be influenced by whether the design applies to the development of a new
road or improvements to an existing road.
NOTE 1
Appendix A provides information on the approach to landscape design for new roads.
NOTE 2
Appendix B provides information on the approach to landscape design for existing roads.
3.9
The landscape design shall respond to local landscape characteristics and character areas(s) and
optimise opportunities to improve landscape quality.
3.9.1
The landscape design should be informed by appropriate local landforms and vegetation communities,
and utilise the composition, pattern and form of planting groups to integrate the proposal into the
semi-natural or man-made setting.
3.9.2
The landscape design should be informed by the scale and pattern of the settlements it interacts with,
as well as their use of local materials, architectural detailing, street composition and public use of space.
NOTE 1
The landscape design is an opportunity to create new landmarks and features, such as individual tree
specimens, distinctive tree groupings, or open meadows.
NOTE 2
A careful approach to scale can be necessary to achieve good design in areas where strategic roads
interact with local roads, such that the appropriate scale is provided for both the user and the receiving
landscape.

3. Design objectives
NOTE 3
Roadside planting with a good visual structure - such as a varying offset from the road to create
fluctuations in scale, changes in planting density such that views into wooded areas are allowed, and
breaks in planting such that the landscape beyond is glimpsed - helps to reduce the monotony of the
road.
NOTE 4
The scale and structure of planting can be used to help warn drivers of the upcoming navigation
requirements of the road, such as narrowing the focus of the driver where manoeuvres occur, and
reducing the scale (and increasing the frequency) of planting groupings to encourage a reduction in
speed.
3.10
The landscape design shall maximise the multiple benefits of the highway estate and its constituent
parts, informed by the site-specific needs and the opportunities identified by the landscape strategy.
3.10.1
The landscape design should aim to maximise the benefits of planting to walkers, cyclists, and
horse-riders (WCH) and align with the requirements of CD 143 [Ref 2.N] 'Designing for walking, cycling
and horseriding'.
NOTE 1
Planting can provide multi-functional benefits to the users of WCH routes (potentially encouraging their
use), such as shade and shelter, localised reductions in temperature, visual and other sensory interest,
a connection to nature and well-being benefits, and the screening of less desirable views.
NOTE 2
It is important to minimise any adverse effects of the landscape design upon the safety and perceived
safety of existing and proposed WCH routes.
3.11
The landscape planting proposals shall account for the longer term maintenance, management and
nature of the road corridor that it is intended for, including operational as well as safety requirements.
3.11.1
Planting outside the highway boundary, where agreed and permitted by adjacent landowners, may be
implemented to allow for better integration with the surrounding landscape and to deliver environmental
mitigation.
3.12
Landscape earthworks design shall be a part of the overall design response to landscape context,
including, for example, the creation of slopes that echo the surrounding natural landform, whilst always
meeting the geotechnical requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
3.12.1
Retaining the least amount of highway land by the return of land to its former use should not conflict
with the need to provide good road design through reprofiling, to create slopes that could be planted,
seeded or otherwise reintegrated with the surrounding landscape.

Detailed design
Landscape earthworks
4.1
Landscape earthworks shall be used to both minimise noise and visual intrusion, and to integrate the
design into the landscape.
4.1.1
In order to integrate with the surrounding landscape, landscape earthworks may vary in slope, height,
and alignment, and deviate from the alignment of the road itself.
NOTE 1
Landscape earthworks can be designed so that the road corridor echoes the topography of the
surrounding land, allowing a consistency of landscape from one side of the road to the other.
NOTE 2
Landscape earthworks that form sharp angles at the top or toe of the slope are to be avoided since they
can reinforce the linearity of the road, potentially increasing the severance of the landscape pattern.
NOTE 3
The scale, form, and treatment of roadside slopes, through well-structured planting and seeding that
reflects the local soils, are an opportunity to provide a strong sense of place.
Soils
4.2
Imported peat-based growing media shall not be used within the planting design.
4.3
The landscape design shall be informed by the local soil conditions and utilise site-won soils and
substrates suitable for the proposed planting.
4.4
All areas for planting and seeding proposed by the landscape design shall include the necessary
ground preparation measures to deliver the benefits and aims identified by the landscape strategy, and
a high landscape quality over time.
NOTE 1
Soils and soil health, during both construction and operation, are assessed within LA 109 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE 2
Soils are a living medium that provide countless influences on the natural and man-made world,
facilitating important natural systems and providing numerous ecosystems services.
Planting
4.5
The landscape planting proposals shall select specified plant sizes that maximise the chances of plant
survival and establishment, while meeting the objectives of the landscape strategy and any mitigation
requirements.
4.5.1
Larger specified tree sizes that require relatively intensive and longer maintenance to ensure their
survival should be avoided unless there are specific landscape objectives that require them, such as
trees in urban settings.
4.6
The landscape planting proposals shall place no new shrubs or trees within 4.5 m from the edge of the
carriageway, no medium size trees (mature tree girth greater than 450 mm) within 7 m, and no larger,
climax trees (mature tree girth greater than 600 mm) within 9 m.
NOTE
The requirements of the Overseeing Organisation apply. Refer to the National Application Annex where
applicable.
4.6.1
Tree species should be selected and positioned to minimise the amount of drop material, such as
branches, seeds and fruit, falling on the footways or other paved areas.
4.6.2
Offsets should be provided such that proposed planting does not inhibit the use of or become a hazard
to users of footpaths, cyclepaths, bridleways, parking areas and laybys.
4.7
The landscape planting proposals shall allow for access to highway structures and features, such as
bridges, barriers, gantries, signs, ditches, CCTV cameras, and not conflict with their operational
functions.
Establishment and maintenance of planted and seeded areas
4.8
The establishment and maintenance period of planted and seeded areas shall be 5 years.

4. Detailed design
4.9
The landscape design shall include plant protection as required to prevent damage due to
establishment and maintenance operations, such as mowing and herbicide spraying, and mammal
browsing.
4.9.1
Tree and shrub tubes and guards should be selected that meet the needs of the species proposed.
4.10
Plant protection shall be in the form of fencing, tubes, or guards, as described in Table 4.10.
Table 4.10 Plant protection
Type of guard
Description
Fencing
This consists of creating an enclosed area free of grazing pests. This system
suits individual large trees that are planted in high-risk grazing areas and for
dense planting areas such as hedgerows.
Tubes
This consists of using individual tubes to prevent access from grazing pests,
This system is best used for trees as it trains the tree to grow with an upright
stem and reduces the occurrence of low-level branches. This system is to be
used in conjunction with stakes as per manufacturers' guidance.
Guards
This consists of using individual guards to prevent access from grazing pests.
This system is best used for shrubs as the guards are wider in diameter than
tubes and allows low- level branches to allow the shrubs natural shape and form.
This system is to be used in conjunction with suitable stakes as per
manufacturers guidance.
4.11
The landscape design shall minimise the maintenance burden of its proposals whilst still achieving the
landscape objectives and maintaining design quality.
NOTE
The maintenance burden can be reduced by including steps to reduce the carbon cost of maintenance
activities and to improve the safety of maintenance operations.
Trees in paved areas
4.12
When planting in paved areas, the landscape design shall select appropriate tree species that avoid
damage to infrastructure caused by tree growth.
NOTE
Planting methodologies could include appropriate species selection, and tree pit design that includes
root management, irrigation, soil volume, and surface design.
4.13
Root deflectors shall be used where there is a need to direct roots away from the surface, or a specific
area/feature.
4.14
Where individual trees in paved areas are proposed, the landscape design shall include measures to
maintain design quality within the context of the public realm, such as formative pruning, the removal of
suckers and obstructive branches, the maintenance of tree protection installations, and the resilient
design of tree pits and adjacent paved areas.
General requirements for fencing
4.15
All fencing proposed shall be designed so that it facilitates adjoining land use.
NOTE
The interface between fencing types is particularly important in achieving a neat finish and high design
quality.
Temporary fencing
4.16
Where required, temporary fencing for landscape design shall consist of post and wire fencing or
chestnut pale fencing only.

4.16.1
Temporary fencing may be connected to existing structures and/or fences where this would secure the
fencing and not damage the existing structure/fence.
Permanent fencing
4.17
Permanent fencing shall be designed to integrate with the local landscape character, be
complementary to the design vision, and avoid adding to the visual clutter caused by multiple materials,
forms, and discordant alignments being visible in one place.
4.18
Permanent fencing shall be one of the following types:
1)
wire-mesh netting;
2)
welded wire-mesh netting;
3)
high-tensile wire fencing;
4)
steel wire-woven hinged-joint fencing;
5)

4.18.1
Extra posts, stakes, and/or ground anchors should be used to create a neat, flowing alignment, both in
plan and elevation, for permanent fencing on uneven ground.
4.19
Barbed wire shall not be used in areas accessible to the general public.
Ecological fencing
4.20
Temporary and permanent ecological fencing shall be installed to meet the requirements of statutory
consultees, and the landscape and ecological objectives.
4.21
Where required, temporary and permanent ecological fencing shall be designed to integrate with other
fencing and boundary treatments to maintain design quality.
4.21.1
Permanent ecological fencing should be treated as part of the design vision along with all other
permanent fencing so that visual clutter is avoided.
Masterplans
4.22
Environmental functions and environmental/landscape elements within the environmental masterplans
shall be submitted to the Overseeing Organisation in the relevant geographical information system
(GIS) format unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
The requirements of the Overseeing Organisation apply. Refer to the National Application Annex where
applicable.
4.23

Appendix A. Approach to landscape design - new roads
Appendix A. Approach to landscape design - new roads
A1
Scope
This appendix provides guidance on the approach to landscape design for new roads incorporating
three key aspects - connecting people, connecting places and connecting processes. It also provides
guidance on the design approach to such aspects as landform, alignment, planting, the road corridor,
rural landscapes, and aesthetic quality. Supplementary guidance can be available for specific
landscape areas or aspects of landscape treatment but will require the prior agreement of the
Overseeing Organisation for use.
A2
Options development
The design of new roads involves the development of options/alternatives and an assessment of the
effects each would have on the broader landscape, its character and setting as the design evolves.
Assessing and understanding these effects is fundamental to the design life-cycle in influencing the
decision making and arriving at the final design solution, but does involve time. For this reason, the
early involvement of a suitably qualified landscape architect during the options phase is important to
understand these effects, so that the best options are developed and the design choices are fully
informed.
Achieving a good design requires commitment from all parties (including the client, design team,
contractor, statutory environmental bodies, and local communities) during the design life-cycle along
with a clear understanding of aesthetic principles (i.e. line, shape, sense of place, texture, etc.) and
sensitivity of the environment (susceptibility and value), as well as the functional and technical
considerations. An appreciation of conflicting project requirements requires collaborative working in
achieving a consensus to an aesthetic and sensitive solution' designing in a way that aligns with the
broader aspirations of the local communities and stakeholders.
Many factors influence road design with the landscape and its setting playing an important part in how
the road is perceived and sits within the context of the local landscape character. A clear understanding
(through a landscape appraisal) of the aesthetic qualities, the landscape and its character, and the
surrounding environment/setting, together with an appreciation of the potentially conflicting functional
and technical requirements of the proposals, is required to develop a landscape strategy and/or defined
set of project specific landscape objectives. These play an important role in design development.
A landscape strategy and/or defined set of project-specific landscape objectives forms the basis of the
design solutions presented in an environmental/landscape masterplan, identifying the functions and
elements required to deliver the project's proposed environmental/landscape design. To ensure design
quality throughout the design life-cycle, the masterplan informs the development of the detailed design,
which in turn informs the construction and operational phases of the overall design and ultimately
delivers the landscape strategy and/or objectives.
A3
Alignment and landform
The consideration and development of alignment design(s) should include the locations of main roads,
side roads, rights of way, junctions, structures, access roads, sustainable drainage systems and any
associated major utilities works. Alignment plays an important part in minimising the effects of road
design on landform and, in turn, the landscape. As such, the application of good road design at the
alignment stage can reduce the extent of the works, its cost, and the difficulty in avoiding or mitigating
adverse environmental effects. An alignment that utilises the existing landform and reflects natural
slopes can minimise a road's impact on setting whilst providing the road with a strong sense of place.
A4
The road corridor
Redundant roads, overbridges, side road crossings, junctions, signs, footpaths, bridleways, side roads,
lighting, fences and retaining structures that form part of a road design need to respect and reflect the
local landscape character and its setting. Integration into the landscape is important, with nature
recovery and landscape enhancement possible through careful design, the right landform and planting,

Appendix A. Approach to landscape design - new roads
as well as through choice of materials and avoidance of unsympathetic standard details. This is
possible through collaboration within the design team and with external statutory consultees and
affected parties.
It is important to understand the effect that components such as environmental barriers, structures,
boundary fencing, and technology have on the quality of the completed design and on the identity of
the road corridor. A well-designed road is one whose components fit together well, are consistent and
elegant in design, and in which clutter is minimised.
A5
Integration within rural landscapes
Reflecting the landscape character of the area through which the road passes and providing
consistency and continuity through site-specific designs is the essence of integration. Use of local
materials and styles is to be encouraged as part of any design solution where this is feasible. The
design should seek to avoid fragmenting landholdings and local landscape patterns by careful
consideration of scale, alignment and the retention of existing features. Therefore, a thorough
understanding of the area, its landscape character and the various landscape elements therein is
required.
It is important to remember that design components, such as landscape earthworks and drainage
ponds, can appear engineered and incongruent to certain landscapes, despite the fact that they consist
of 'soft' materials.
Integration within the rural landscape may provide opportunities for the enhancement to or creation of
site-specific grass/wildflower areas as visual and wildlife corridors. Such opportunities should be
explored in developing the landscape design.
A6
The public realm
When areas of public realm are near strategic roads, issues of scale can arise. This commonly occurs
where strategic roads join local roads.The public realm should be designed at a human scale, so that
the activities of pedestrians (and cyclists, where access for these users is present) is, and is perceived
to be, the dominant factor in the design of the space. It may be appropriate to employ a different
planting approach in these areas (to reflect a smaller scale and to reduce the visual dominance of hard
materials), and install paving finishes that promote legibility (making the routes through the space clear
to the users) and are appropriate to the local building vernacular.
A7
Planting, vegetation and soils
The landscape objectives should be reflected in the development of proposed planting and seeding and
their future management. Reflecting the surrounding area's landscape pattern and species composition
not only plays an important part in the quality of a landscape design but also in its ecological function. It
is also important for the landscape design to reflect the soil conditions present or required for successful
establishment of particular habitat requirements, such as low soil fertility for species rich grassland.
Defining areas for landscape enhancement, vegetation retention and, where necessary, mitigation
planting is crucial to developing the environmental/landscape masterplan and maintaining aesthetic
quality. This may include planting outside the road boundary.
Creating, enhancing, and maintaining views, as well as effective screening that reflects the local
character and is not an intrusion into the landscape, are achieved through good design and sensitive
road alignment. The use of natural characteristics in planting and landforms, and building on locally
distinctive features and qualities, are key to the integration of the road into the landscape.
Signalling the change from rural landscapes to urban environments using a distinctive road-corridor
landscape focuses the road user's attention and plays an important part in providing a sense of place
and a distinctive character or style to a road corridor and the urban fringe. Bold or formal planting can
provide structure, while well-sited planting can highlight landmarks or other noteworthy features.
Key to good landscape design is not only the appropriate composition and pattern(s) of planting,
respecting existing site conditions together with the retention of existing vegetation, but also the

Successful planting establishment requires the appropriate level of management during and after the
establishment period.

Heritage
It is important for the design to conserve and enhance the cultural and historic character and setting of
the landscape, its historic settlements, and the urban environment. Maintaining and enhancing historic
views and vistas should be a priority and may be possible through the appropriate alignment of the
road, landscape earthworks, planting, and vegetation management. This requires collaboration with an
archaeologist or relevant heritage professional to identify potential conflicts and opportunities in
developing the design.
A9
Walkers, cyclists and horse-riders
A successful and well-designed route for walkers, cyclists and horse-riders (WCH) is one that is useful
and attractive to use. While the geometry of a route is important to meet the needs of the user, it is not
the only quality required to demonstrate good design. A useful route is one that connects people to
places they want to go. This may be as a route to places of work, education, employment, and so on,
or it may be connecting communities to their surrounding landscapes and landscape features (such as
scenic viewpoints). It could certainly be both at the same time. WCH routes may also be part of, or
provide in whole, circular recreational routes - these are a valuable resource to communities and their
health and well-being. There are a wide range of qualities that make WCH routes attractive to use, and
these include the difficulty of the terrain and their perceived safety. Good road design provides WCH
routes that allow the user to interact with the landscape - to explore its various sensory features (a good
route allows a user to explore with all their senses, not just visual). Variation along a route is important
to allow the user to structure their journey, and to provide interest. The alignment of the route can be
designed to reflect the local landscape pattern, the topography, and to give the user a sense of
exploring space. Planting and habitat design can provide the user with opportunities to interact with
nature and reinforce sense of place, and the opening and closing of views can be used to help them
appreciate the varying scale of the landscape through which they pass.

Appendix B. Approach to landscape design - improving e...
Appendix B. Approach to landscape design - improving existing roads
B1
Scope
This appendix provides guidance on the approach to landscape design for improving roads within
existing highway land or within limited land take. Works of this nature are often limited in scope, which
can result in a number of constraints, but can also provide opportunities for enhancement to the
aesthetic quality of the existing road. The guidance provided relates to such aspects as landform,
alignment, planting, the road corridor, and aesthetic quality.
B2
Options development
As with new roads many factors can influence the design for improving existing roads with the
landscape and its setting playing an important part in how the improvement is perceived and sits within
the context of the local landscape character. While it can prove more difficult to promote improvements
to aesthetic qualities of existing roads, opportunities to enhance the views and setting should still be
sought, providing interest for the users of the road and well as the visual receptors in the wider
landscape. An understanding of the landscape, its character and the surrounding environment/setting,
together with an appreciation of conflicting functional and technical considerations, is required. This in
turn influences a landscape strategy and/or project specific landscape objectives that plays an
important role in design development and towards improving the aesthetic qualities.
The same process of developing options/alternatives is used but can be limited in scope due to the
project's location and existing layout. As with designing for new roads, an assessment of the effects
each would have on the broader landscape, its character and setting, as the design evolves, is
required. Understanding these effects is fundamental to the design life-cycle in influencing the final
design solution, but does involve time. For this reason, the early involvement of a suitably qualified
landscape architect during the options phase is important to understand these effects, so that the best
options are developed and the design choices are fully informed.
Achieving a good design requires commitment from all parties (including the client, design team,
contractor, statutory environmental bodies, and local communities) during the design life-cycle along
with a clear understanding of aesthetic principles (that is, line, shape, sense of place, texture, etc.) and
sensitivity of the environment (susceptibility and value), as well as the functional and technical
considerations. An appreciation of conflicting project requirements requires collaborative working in
achieving a consensus to an aesthetic and sensitive solution; designing in a way that aligns with the
broader aspirations of the local communities and stakeholders.
Design tasks that are notably limited in scope may not warrant an environmental/landscape masterplan,
but a landscape strategy and/or set of project specific landscape objectives can suffice to inform and
deliver the landscape design and reduce the impact of the road on people and the environment.
B3
Improvement techniques
An integrated approach should:
1)
minimise conflict by respecting and integrating the road into the local context;
2)
minimise adverse effects to the natural, built, and historic environment;
3)
provide enhancement opportunities for biodiversity, landscape and townscape; and
4)
provide interest for both the road user and those in the wider landscape, such as residents,
visitors to the landscape and its features, users of local roads, and walkers, cyclists, and
horse-riders (WCH).
Design solutions can, therefore, need to consider new techniques. These can include appropriate
planting designs, use of materials, contrasting forms, colour, texture and introducing variety and
opening up views to create visual interest and reduce the impact caused by limited land take. A
balance between the proportion of hard and soft landscape elements is important but this is often
determined by location and local context.

S/3.
Design development [LD 117, 4.6]
S/3.1
Clause 4.6 of LD 117 shall not apply.
S/3.2
Road and planting design shall take account of long-term maintenance, management, and the nature
of the road corridor that it is intended for, including operational and safety requirements.
S/3.2.1
The design should avoid any loss of ancient woodlands, ancient and veteran trees, or adverse impact
on their ecological condition.
NOTE 1
Existing woodlands, ancient and veteran trees, and tree and shrub planting alongside roads make an
important contribution to biodiversity.
NOTE 2
The Scottish Government is committed to protecting biodiversity, reversing biodiversity loss and
delivering positive effects from development ( NPF4 [Ref 2.I]).
NOTE 3
Scottish Government's National Planning Framework 4 states that development proposals will not be
supported where they will result in any loss of ancient woodlands, ancient and veteran trees, or
adverse impact on their ecological condition ( NPF4 [Ref 2.I]).
S/3.3
A suitably qualified landscape architect shall coordinate those elements of risk assessment relevant to
determining the minimum offset distances from the trafficked edge of carriageway, hard shoulder, or
hard strip where present, to tree and shrub planting for each planting location, with inputs from a
suitably qualified engineer.
S/3.3.1
The risk assessment should consider the following:
1)
the landscape and environmental importance and value of the tree and shrub planting;
2)
visibility requirements;
3)
whether the new planting would introduce obstructions that would endanger vehicle occupants;
4)
safety of future maintenance operations;
5)
potential for overhanging limbs and falling tree limbs;
6)
need or otherwise for vertical restraint systems determined by the Road Restraint Risk
Assessment Process ( RRRAP [Ref 6.N]); and
7)
accident history (on existing roads).
S/3.3.2
The risk assessment should be undertaken to inform the preparation of the landscape design and
environmental mitigation drawings during the EIA stage to ensure that sufficient space is allocated, and
land acquired for planting, at an early stage of the project.
S/3.3.3
Notwithstanding the outcome of the risk assessment, the minimum offset distances from the trafficked
edge of carriageway, hard shoulder, or hard strip where present, to planting should be 3 metres for
shrubs and 5 metres for trees.

conservation value of the road estate and its surroundings,
including measures to achieve positive effects for
biodiversity.
EFE
Visual amenity
Improvement or maintenance of the visual experience of
road users and people in the surrounding area by creating,
maintaining or enhancing attractive views, for example
framing views of the wider landscape, providing seasonal
variation with planting, creating a 'sense of place' via
landmark features or use of special materials and finishes.
EFF
Heritage
Conservation or enhancement of the physical nature,
appearance, setting or understanding of features of cultural
heritage value within and near to the road, where they are
either afforded statutory protection, or contribute to the
quality and character of the local area. May include
elements such as drystone walls or hedgerows to reflect
and integrate with traditional field boundaries.
EFG
Auditory amenity
Provision of measures to reduce the adverse noise impact
of road traffic or construction at properties or publicly
accessible areas.
EFH
Water quality
Provision of measures to mitigate the impact of the

flooding or hydrological changes, local water courses, water
bodies or groundwater.
S/4.5
In addition to the environmental function codes each design and mitigation measure shall be labelled
with a written description of the design objective and environmental function including details of
receptors expected to benefit.
S/4.6
Where an individual area or design element has multiple functions, these shall be included in the
written description and labelled with all relevant function codes.
NOTE
Individual design elements often have multiple functions, for example an area of planting might screen
views of traffic from a receptor (EFA), help to integrate the scheme into the surrounding landscape

S/5.
Seeding of verges, visibility splays and central reserves
Seed mixes for verges, visibility splays and central reserves
S/5.1
Where verges, visibility splays and widened central reserves feature soft landscape, these shall be
seeded with an appropriate seed mix.
S/5.1.1
Seed mixes used on verges, visibility splays and central reserves should be low-growing,
low-maintenance, native, and species-rich, to promote biodiversity, reduce maintenance and create a
visually attractive roadside environment.
Soil requirements for species-rich grasslands
S/5.2
The substrate for seeding of species-rich grassland shall be subsoil, bare-substrate, or shallow
low-fertility topsoil as defined in BS 3882 [Ref 5.N].
S/5.3
Topsoil, subsoil and bare substrate shall be tested for nutrient levels and suitability for supporting the
proposed seeding mix and if necessary modified to encourage wildflower growth and minimise
competition from undesirable weed species and coarse grasses.
S/5.3.1
Not using topsoil in the specification of new species-rich grassland has the potential to result in a topsoil
surplus, which should be addressed early in the design process, considering the different topsoil depths
required for landscape and environmental design elements and the area of land required for the project.
NOTE
Topsoil is a vital reservoir for biodiversity containing a highly diverse range of organisms including
bacteria, fungi, microflora and microfauna which interact and contribute to the carbon and nitrogen
cycles. There is a need to preserve and maintain topsoil in good condition to safeguard biodiversity and
store carbon to help combat climate change ( Dobbie et al 2011 [Ref 3.I]).
S/5.4
Topsoil shall not be buried or spread to excessive depths that lead to degradation of the soil biome or
result in development of anaerobic conditions.
NOTE
Topsoil does not normally perform well below a depth of 400 mm from the surface, where there is an
increase in self-compaction and where the biochemical oxygen demand often exceeds the rate of
aeration. This often results in the development of anaerobic conditions that are detrimental to plant root
functions ( Soils CoP [Ref 1.I]).
S/5.4.1
The removal of topsoil from site should only be considered as a last resort and be avoided unless it can
be demonstrated that it would have a beneficial environmental effect.

Appendix S/A. Approach to landscape design and environmental
mitigation measures [LD 117, Appendix A]
S/A1
Scope of Appendix
This appendix provides guidance on the approach to preparation of drawings at the various stages of
design development from EIA to completion of construction.
S/A2
Design stage drawings
Landscape design and environmental mitigation drawings are typically prepared for each of the
following design stages:
1) Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment
Landscape and environmental mitigation drawings to set out the proposals to mitigate landscape and
environmental effects and provide environmental enhancements. Generic planting and seeding mix
types including the habitat type they are intended to create are included as a minimum. The landscape
and environmental mitigation drawings prepared at this stage are in place of the 'masterplan' referred to
in Appendices A and B of LD 117 [Ref 4.N].
2) Contract
Indicative landscape and environmental design contract drawings to accommodate post EIA
developments to the road design, typically including greater detail than the landscape and
environmental mitigation drawings. Indicative planting and seeding species mixes are typically
included.
3) Tender
Drawings submitted by tenderers containing a similar level of information and detail to the indicative
landscape and environmental design contract drawings but modified to align with the conceptual
engineering design proposals including any innovations or value engineering changes proposed by the
tenderer.
4) Detail design
Drawings including full details required for construction.
5) Completion
As-built drawings to be submitted to the Overseeing Organisation in the relevant geographical
information system.
