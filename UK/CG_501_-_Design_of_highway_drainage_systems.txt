Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document, and others in the drainage series of DMRB, now accommodate design-related text
extracted from MCHW Series 500 during its update to CC 500 [Ref 10.N]. Drawings and details from
the Highway Construction Details B-Series (Edge of Pavement Details) and F-Series (Drainage) have
also been accommodated within the DMRB drainage series.
This document sets out requirements and provides recommendations on the design of drainage for the
UK motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. It describes the various alternative drainage solutions that
are available, including their potential to control pollution and flooding, as well as detailed design
factors to be taken into account.
Road drainage can be broadly split into two categories: surface and sub-surface drainage. Generally
speaking, road surfacing materials are effectively impermeable, and rainfall which does not permeate
the carriageway surface is shed towards the edges of the pavement and into surface water drainage
systems. Surface water can also infiltrate into road foundations, earthworks or structures through any
surface which is not completely impermeable, and as such sub-surface drainage is utilised to allow
such water to drain through underlying pavement layers and away from the formation.
The types of drainage discussed in this standard are one element of road drainage. Other elements
include:
1)
outfalls and culverts - see CD 529 [Ref 6.N];
2)
soakaways - see CD 530 [Ref 7.N];
3)
reservoir pavements - see CD 531 [Ref 19.N];
4)
gullies - see CD 527 [Ref 24.N];
5)
chamber tops and gully tops - see CD 534 [Ref 1.N];
6)
certification of drainage design - see CG 502 [Ref 25.N]; and
7)
chambers for drainage pipes - see CD 536 [Ref 2.N].
Surface drainage is achieved through collection of surface water runoff from the pavement (and
potentially adjacent land) through formal (such as through kerbs and gullies) or informal (over the edge)
drainage, discharging into longitudinal surface channels or piped systems.
Sub-surface drainage is achieved by installation of longitudinal sub-surface drains situated in verges
and/or central reserves at the low edges of road pavements. These drain the pavement layers and the
pavement foundation (pavement and capping layers are contiguous with the side of the trench) and
prevent ingress of water from verge areas adjacent to the pavement.
Drainage designs may utilise combined systems (where both surface water and subsurface water are
collected in the same pipe) or separate systems (where subsurface water is collected in a separate
drainage conduit from the one that is used for collection of surface water).
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 18.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or other technical
specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition clause in GG
101 [Ref 18.N].

2. Design principles
NOTE 1
Groundwater quality standards can vary over time and between the various environmental protection
bodies.
NOTE 2
The acceptability of different risks varies according to geographic location, and is site specific.
2.6
Road drainage shall only be discharged into lakes, ponds, canals or reservoirs where a site-specific
risk assessment produced in compliance with LA 113 [Ref 20.N] demonstrates that this represents no
or minimal risk to the lake, pond, canal or reservoir.
2.6.1
Discharge of road drainage to ground within a groundwater source protection zone 1 (SPZ 1) should be
avoided. (See Environment Agency LIT 7660 [Ref 5.I]) .
NOTE
Guidance on discharge of road drainage to ground within a SPZ 1 is given within LA 113 [Ref 20.N].
2.6.2
Discharge of road drainage to ground within a groundwater Source protection zone 2 (SPZ 2) should
be avoided (see LIT 7660 [Ref 5.I]) though the acceptance of such is likely to require less justification
than within a SPZ 1.
2.7
Discharge of road drainage shall not be to a foul sewer.
2.8
Where the rate of surface water runoff is greater than the rate at which water is able to infiltrate into the
ground, discharge to the ground shall be utilised to drain water within the capacity of the ground
conditions.
2.9
Discharge to the ground shall not create an unacceptable risk of groundwater flooding, ground
instability or groundwater contamination.
2.10
Where the rate of surface water runoff is greater than the rate at which water is able to infiltrate into the
ground, the excess runoff shall be drained to surface water or sewer options in accordance with Figure
2.5.
2.10.1
When using the decision flowchart in Figure 2.5 the potential to use mitigation measures (such as flow
attenuation or SuDS) should be evaluated.
General requirements of drainage design
2.11
A document describing the technical basis of the drainage design shall be prepared and submitted to
the Overseeing Organisation in accordance with CG 502 [Ref 25.N].
NOTE
Factors associated with baseline environment are site-specific and include catchment size, drained
areas, runoff destination, space, topography, groundwater, soil permeability, existing drainage and
sensitive receptors.
2.12
The use of the decision flowchart in Figure 2.5, together with the justification for the outcomes of it,
shall be recorded in the document describing the technical basis of the drainage design.
2.12.1
The drainage design should be carried out early in the design process for a project.
2.13
All drainage designs shall incorporate safety measures as required by CD 521 [Ref 17.N], CD 524 [Ref
14.N], CD 525 [Ref 5.N] and CD 532 [Ref 28.N].
NOTE
CD 532 [Ref 28.N] includes details of safety risk assessments and mitigation measures for open bodies
of water.
2.14
Assessment of effects of road drainage on the water environment shall be carried out in accordance
with LA 113 [Ref 20.N].
2.15

NOTE 1
Additional details on the advantages and disadvantages of these drainage types are presented in
Appendix A. Tables 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 provide details of edge of pavement and central reserve drainage
design options.
NOTE 2
The general principle of highway drainage is that surface water and sub-surface water are kept
separate as far as practically possible until the sub-surface water discharges to a chamber that
connects to the carrier pipe. This is in order to prevent large amounts of water being introduced to the
road pavement foundation, however the use of combined drainage is preferable in certain
circumstances (see Combined drainage (below) and Table 3.4).
3.5
Edge of pavement drains shall be included on all roads except the following, in accordance with CD
524 [Ref 14.N]:
1)
roads with combined surface and sub-surface drains;
2)
roads comprising rigid or flexible carriageways with over-the-edge drainage; and,
3)
roads with free draining subgrade.

The decision processes presented in Table 3.5.1 may be used to determine the most appropriate edge
of pavement drainage design.

3.6
Where a pavement overlay is being installed over an existing pavement, the design of the overlay shall
not compromise operation of existing pavement edge drainage.
3.7
The levels of gully grating and filter media on kerb and gully drains or combined surface and
sub-surface drains shall be raised to match the new pavement level.
3.7.1
The edge of the overlay may be shaped to tie in with the top of surface water channels if it can be
achieved without compromising the structural integrity of the pavement.
3.7.2
As an alternative to shaping the edge of the overlay, the existing drainage channel may be broken out
and replaced at a higher level.
Surface water drainage design
3.8
Where surface water edge of pavement drainage is used it shall be designed in accordance with the
requirements of these documents: CD 521 [Ref 17.N], CD 524 [Ref 14.N], CD 525 [Ref 5.N] and LA
113 [Ref 20.N].
Kerb and gully drainage
3.9
Kerb and gully drainage systems located within the nosing sections of junction merge and diverge
tapers shall be designed to withstand trafficking of the hard shoulder.
NOTE
Locations such as the nosing sections of junction merge and diverge tapers commonly have low points
in cross-section due to the direction of crossfalls.
3.10
Where kerb and gully drainage is designed in combination with fin drains, it shall not have an adverse
effect on fin drain operation.
NOTE 1
Functioning of kerb and gully systems is dependent upon the build-up of a flow of water in front of the
kerb.
NOTE 2
Flows of water against the kerb face generally increase in the direction of longitudinal gradient until the
flow is intercepted by a road gully.
NOTE 3
Build-up of widths of water flow, which have the potential to intrude into the hard shoulder, hardstrip or
carriageway of the highway present a hazard to vehicles.
3.11
Gully spacing shall be designed in accordance with CD 526 [Ref 22.N] .
NOTE
Details of acceptable flow widths are presented in CD 526 [Ref 22.N].
3.11.1
For low embankments with toe ditches, gullies may discharge directly to the toe ditches via discrete
outlets.

3. Road drainage design selection
Combined drainage
3.12
Where combined surface and sub-surface drainage is used it shall be designed in accordance with the
requirements of this document and CD 525 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
The requirements and advice on pipe and bedding combinations in combined surface and sub-surface
drains is presented in CD 533 [Ref 8.N].
3.13
Surface treatment or stabilisation of combined surface and sub-surface drains shall be included in the
design at locations where the risk of stone scatter occurring is greatest (refer to CD 525 [Ref 5.N]).
NOTE
Potential risks associated with combined surface and sub-surface drains include surface failure of
embankments and pavement failures.
3.13.1
To minimise surface water input at trench base level, the design of combined drainage for cuttings may
include pipes with sealed joints and with perforations or slots laid uppermost.
3.13.2
Lining of trench bottoms with impermeable membranes up to pipe soffit level may be used to prevent
infiltration of water from the drainage system into surrounding dry sub-soil or from polluting an
underlying aquifer.
3.13.3
Separate design estimates for groundwater flow may not be needed when designing combined surface
and sub-surface drainage for a cutting.
Sub-surface drainage design
3.14
Where sub-surface drainage is used it shall be designed in accordance with CD 524 [Ref 14.N].
3.15
The design of sub-surface drainage shall include shaping of the formation and sub-formation such that
sub-surface water drains to longitudinal sub-surface drains.
3.16
Sub-surface water shall not be retained within the subbase or capping layer.
3.17
The minimum depth of installation of fin and narrow filter drains shall be as shown in CD 524 [Ref 14.N]
relative to formation level, or sub-formation level.
3.18
Where there is no capping layer, fin and narrow filter drains shall be laid to the lower of either formation
or sub-formation level.
3.19
Drains shall maintain the water table level at least 300 mm below the road sub-formation level.
NOTE 1
High groundwater levels have the potential to interfere with the operation of surface water drainage
systems.
NOTE 2
In situations where large volumes of groundwater are anticipated, filter drains can provide a better
solution than fin or narrow filter drains.
3.20
The design of sub-surface drainage shall not contain any low spots where water can accumulate.
3.20.1
Use of 100 mm-diameter pipes within narrow filter drains, rather than pipes of smaller diameter, may
reduce future maintenance costs.
3.21
The subbase shall be drained unless the underlying materials (capping or subgrade) are more
permeable than the subbase, and the water table is never within 300 mm of the underside of the
foundation (in accordance with CD 225 [Ref 4.N]).
Embankments and cuttings
3.22
Subsurface drainage in cuttings shall lower groundwater to a depth such that it does not have the
potential to interfere with the operation of a surface water drainage system (in accordance with CD 525
[Ref 5.N]).
3.22.1
Circumstances in which subsurface drainage may be omitted are described in CD 524 [Ref 14.N].

Climate change allowances for the design of carriageway drainage
4.1
The design of carriageway drainage shall apply the latest climate change allowances for peak rainfall
intensity in accordance with the requirements set out in the relevant National Application Annex.
NOTE
This section of CG 501 (Section 4) addresses how the effects of climate change are dealt with as part
of carriageway drainage design only. For the design of features to minimise flood risk, refer to LA 113
[Ref 20.N]
4.2
Where climate change allowances are not stated in the relevant National Application Annex, a 20 %
uplift in peak rainfall intensity shall be applied and documented within the report on the drainage design
described in CG 502 [Ref 25.N].
4.3
Where climate change allowances are not stated in the relevant National Application Annex, a
sensitivity test to 40 % uplift in peak rainfall intensity shall be undertaken and documented within the
report on the drainage design described in CG 502 [Ref 25.N].
NOTE
The difference between the 20 % and 40 % scenarios enables understanding of the range of impact
between climate change risk scenarios.
4.4
Where climate change allowances are not stated in the relevant National Application Annex, use of an
increase in peak rainfall intensity of greater than 20 % in carriageway drainage design shall be subject
to approval by the Overseeing Organisation.
4.5
Justification for the value of peak rainfall intensity chosen for the carriageway drainage design shall be
given within the report on the drainage design described in CG 502 [Ref 25.N].
4.6
Drainage designs shall be developed on the basis that all new carriageway drainage has a minimum
design life of 60 years, unless otherwise instructed by the Overseeing Organisation.
4.7
In schemes that use existing outfalls current discharge rates shall not be exceeded.
4.8
All pavement edge drainage for collection of surface runoff plus the carrier pipes/conduits that convey
that runoff shall be designed based on the rainfall experienced by the catchment in which the road is
located.

permissible providing there is safeguard against flows from the surcharged
channel overtopping the central reserve and flowing into the opposing
carriageway
NOTE
For combined surface and sub-surface drains, 1-in-5 year storm requirements are based on the
assumption that pipes are sealed and that flow between pipes and filter material does not take place.
5.3
All drainage systems shall be designed so that highway surface water flooding does not extend beyond
the highway boundary up to the 1-in-100 year rainfall event, including an allowance for climate change.
5.3.1
The risks associated with events that exceed the capacity of the drainage system should be evaluated
and documented within the report on the drainage design described in CG 502 [Ref 25.N].
5.3.2
The design of the site and the drainage system should cope with events that exceed the design
capacity of the system, so that excess water can be safely stored on or conveyed from the site without
adverse impacts.
NOTE
The level of events that need assessment depends upon site-specific conditions and the consequences
of such an event occurring. For further advice see CIRIA C753 [Ref 6.I] and CIRIA C688 [Ref 3.I].
5.3.3
Analytical tools (for example software) utilised to calculate runoff flows from roads should model
particular storm intensities and permit analysis of the system under surcharged conditions.
5.4
The assessment of flood risk both to a project and resulting from a scheme shall be undertaken in
accordance with LA 113 [Ref 20.N].

Drainage from adjacent land
Drainage from adjacent land
6.1
Assessment of existing land drainage and runoff from catchments adjacent to the road pavement shall
be included in the design of highway drainage in accordance with CD 522 [Ref 12.N].
NOTE
Runoff can be derived from land both within the overall highways boundary or external to it.
New and existing connections
6.2
In order to ensure the integrity of road drainage systems, no new runoff that arises due to any change
of use of land within the surface water catchment of the road shall be accepted into the drainage
systems of motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
6.3
No new connections from drainage systems of third party developments shall be permitted to enter the
drainage systems of motorways and all-purpose trunk roads (see DfT Circular 01/22 [Ref 23.N]).
NOTE
Third parties include local highway authorities.
6.3.1
Where there is an existing connection of external drainage to the road drainage, either historical or by
agreement, the right of connection may be permitted by the Overseeing Organisation to continue
provided that the input from the contributing catchment to the connection remains unaltered (see DfT
Circular 01/22 [Ref 23.N]).
6.3.2
Existing surface water flows from local highway authority roads may continue where there is no
alternative outfall, subject to agreement by the Overseeing Organisation.
Management of land drainage
6.4
Where it is not possible to avoid surface water and subsurface water from adjoining land flowing
towards a road, that land drainage shall be managed in accordance with CD 522 [Ref 12.N].
6.4.1
Selection of the most appropriate edge of pavement drainage design may be undertaken using the
decision process presented in Table 3.4.
6.4.2
During the choice of drainage system the potential for contaminated ground or groundwater to exist at
or adjacent to the road should be assessed.
NOTE
Installation of drainage early in the construction process allows management of land drainage during
construction.
6.5
The potential effect of proposed drainage ditches on embankment or cutting slope stability shall be
subject to geotechnical assessment.
6.5.1
In rural areas, ditches may be used to provide a more effective and efficient option than formal drains.
NOTE 1
Offsetting of toe ditches from the base of slopes can aid maintenance of slope stability.
NOTE 2
Assessment of slope stability early in the design process can assist in identification of land acquisition
requirements for the project.
NOTE 3
Offsetting of toe ditches could also have implications for the:
1)
choice of drainage solution;
2)
management of adjacent land; and,
3)
landscape design.
6.6
Where a road crosses an existing watercourse or ditch, the drainage design shall fulfil the requirements
of LA 113 [Ref 20.N], CD 522 [Ref 12.N] and CD 529 [Ref 6.N].

7.
Road geometry
7.1
The design of road geometry shall enable the drainage of surface water runoff for any given length of
carriageway.
7.2
The design of road geometry shall allow the discharge of subgrade drainage at levels above the design
flood level for any given length of carriageway.
7.2.1
A coordinated analysis of the horizontal and vertical alignments with reference to surface water
drainage should be carried out before alignments are fixed.
NOTE
The need to provide appropriate drainage can be a factor in the design height of embankments and
design depth of cuttings.
7.3
The construction tolerances permissible for road levels shall be assessed when producing a road
surface design that can shed water as effectively as possible.
Drainage of superelevated carriageways
7.4
Superelevated carriageways shall be designed to adequately drain water from the carriageway.
7.4.1
A flow path gradient of at least 0.5 % may be used to facilitate drainage from superelevated
carriageways (see CD 109 [Ref 16.N]).
NOTE 1
Where superelevation is applied or removed, the crossfall of a carriageway can be insufficient for
drainage purposes without assistance from the longitudinal gradient of the road.
NOTE 2
The flow path gradient of superelevated carriageways includes the effects of the application of
superelevation acting against the gradient where superelevation is applied to a downhill gradient or
removed on an uphill gradient.
7.4.2
The superelevation area may be moved to a different location by revision of the horizontal alignment,
increasing the variation in grade of the edge profile or applying a rolling crown ( CD 109 [Ref 16.N]).
NOTE
Further advice on shedding of water from superelevated carriageways is provided in CD 109 [Ref 16.N]
and CD 116 [Ref 4.I].
Drainage of wide carriageways
Drainage flow paths
7.5
Wide carriageways shall be designed in accordance with the drainage design principles set out in
Section 2.
NOTE
The requirements for drainage of carriageways and adjacent paved areas in storm events are given in
Table 5.2.
7.5.1
For lengths of carriageway with consistent geometry, the combinations of longitudinal gradient and
crossfall that fall below the curves given in Figure 7.5.1 should be avoided.

7.5.2
For lengths of carriageway with varying width and geometry, contoured plans of the carriageway
surface should be generated in order to calculate local flow path lengths and gradients.
NOTE
The flow path length is calculated from the edge of the paved area being assessed.
7.5.3
Flow path lengths and gradients may be checked by referring to Figures 7.5.3N2a and 7.5.3N2b.
NOTE 1
Flow path lengths can increase rapidly at low crossfalls.
NOTE 2
Roll-over lengths between superelevation areas are where low crossfalls occur and flow path lengths
can be long.

Effect of carriageway edge markings
7.6
Continuous carriageway edge markings shall not exceed a thickness of 3 mm at the drainage exits to
superelevation roll-over areas with sections having a crossfall less than 0.67 % (1 in 150).
NOTE 1
Carriageway surface drainage has the potential to be affected by continuous edge markings,
particularly where raised rib markings are used.
NOTE 2
A continuous carriageway edge marking thickness of less than 3 mm allows water to drain over the line
during storms.
7.7
Where the longitudinal gradient on any section of road is less than 0.67 % (1 in 150) drainage gaps
shall be provided in carriageway edge markings in accordance with TSM Chapter 5 [Ref 27.N].
7.8
Where renewal of markings is being undertaken, existing lines shall be removed at the drainage exit to
a superelevation roll-over area, where the longitudinal gradient is less than 0.67 % (1 in 150).
Crossfalls
7.9
Crossfalls shall be incorporated into the design to adequately drain water from the carriageway.
7.9.1
Where carriageway crown lines are used, crossfalls should be reduced from the standard 2.5 % (1 in
40) to 2 % (1 in 50) for one lane width either side of the crown, to limit the change of angle to 4 % (1 in
25).
NOTE 1
In DMRB CD 109 [Ref 16.N] guidance is given on how to assess both the drainage and appearance of
the road when applying superelevation.
NOTE 2
Crown lines are more easily introduced between hard shoulders and superelevated carriageways, and
at merges and diverges where lane gains and lane drops occur.
NOTE 3
Rolling crowns (crowns that run diagonally) can be applied where surface drainage cannot otherwise
be achieved.
7.9.2
Carriageway crossfalls may be increased from the standard 2.5 % (1 in 40) to 2.85 % (1 in 35) on
lengths of carriageway that are straight or have radii well in excess of those requiring elimination of
adverse camber.
NOTE
Applying an increased crossfall on the additional nearside lanes of a widened carriageway does not
significantly reduce the depth of water at the edge of the carriageway but can increase the capacity of
the road edge channel where kerbs are used.

Pollution and flow control design
Principles of pollution and flow control
8.1
Assessment of effects of road drainage on the water environment shall be carried out in accordance
with LA 113 [Ref 20.N].
8.2
LA 113 [Ref 20.N] shall be used to identify the need for pollution and flow control measures within a
drainage design.
8.3
Pollution control measures shall be designed in compliance with LA 113 [Ref 20.N].
NOTE
A number of the pollution control measures discussed within this document also provide a degree of
flow control.
8.3.1
Pollution control measures should be designed to treat the 'first flush'.
NOTE
Discharges from short intense storms with long antecedent dry periods pose a higher pollution threat
than discharges from longer rainfall events, which provide higher dilution.
8.3.2
A degree of bypass may be acceptable for the larger storm events, where runoff volumes can be higher
and therefore there can be a greater degree of dilution.
NOTE 1
Further information on design of pollution control measures in drainage is published in CIRIA C753 [Ref
6.I] and the DMRB documents referenced in Table 8.3.2N1

8. Pollution and flow control design
NOTE 2
Table 8.3.2N1 presents potential treatment efficiencies for the various pollution control measure types
for different contaminants.
NOTE 3
Types of treatment other than those listed in Table 8.3.2N1 are available.
NOTE 4
While Table 8.3.2N1 gives a singular treatment efficiency value for each type of treatment system it is a
simplified representation of values reported in literature. Individual treatment systems of the same type
will perform differently due to variables including:
1)
variation in influent quality;
2)
climate and season – particularly affecting the performance of vegetated treatment systems;
3)
hydraulic loading – treatment systems perform differently depending on the frequency, duration,
run-off rate and volume of each rainfall event;
4)
variation in design of the treatment system, e.g. residence time, dimensions, plant species used;
and,
5)
frequency and extent of maintenance.
NOTE 5
While Table 8.3.2N1 gives a simplified representation of the treatment performance, it is not a
substitute for informed and site-specific selection of treatment systems.
NOTE 6
The spillage risk reduction factors in Table 8.3.2N1 represent what is considered achievable. Actual
risk reduction factors are site-specific and potentially higher (representing a lower risk reduction)
depending on factors such as size of treatment system and retention time.
NOTE 7
Removal of pollutants likely to occur but insufficient evidence available to quote indicative treatment
efficiency.
NOTE 8
To calculate the combined efficiency of multiple components in a treatment train, the pollutant reduction
factor of each component is multiplied together. For example, where a filter drain removing 60% of
suspended solids (a reduction factor of 0.4) is followed by a vegetated ditch removing 25% of
suspended solids (a reduction factor of 0.75), the combined reduction factor is 0.4 x 0.75 = 0.3 or an
overall efficiency of 70%.
8.4
Where the design of pollution control measures includes infiltration into ground, the risk to groundwater
shall be assessed and mitigation measures, where that assessment identifies the need, implemented in
accordance with LA 113 [Ref 20.N].
8.5
The design of pollution control measures shall include safe means of access for operation (where
relevant), emergency response and maintenance.
8.5.1
Pollution control measures should be located above the level of the flood plain wherever possible.
NOTE
Storm water inundation can compromise the operation of pollution control devices.
Selection of pollution and flow control measures
8.6
The selection and design of pollution and flow control measures shall follow the process presented
below:
1)
complete assessment in accordance with LA 113 [Ref 20.N];
2)
if mitigation is required, identify viable options/combinations of measures, taking account of:
a)
road drainage hierarchy in this document;
b)
site constraints;
c)
storm flow and flood risk requirements;
d)
climate change allowances; and,
e)
road geometry.
3)
review short list of options against construction and maintenance requirements;
4)
confirm measures fulfil mitigation requirements identified from LA 113 [Ref 20.N] assessment;
and,

8. Pollution and flow control design
5)
incorporate mitigation measures into overall drainage design.
8.6.1
Pollution control measures may be used to intercept pollution close to its source, treat it, manage
sediment mobilisation or reduce the risks from spillages.
NOTE 1
The selection and design of systems depends on the pollution load, the risk of spillage or flood. and the
site conditions, particularly if protected habitats, species or sites can be affected.
NOTE 2
Guidance on the design of pipelines for reduced sediment deposition is contained in CD 523 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE 3
Measures to control flooding generally include limiting (attenuating) peak outflows and providing an
appropriate volume of water storage in the system to accommodate large or critical storm events.
8.6.2
Drainage designs for roads may include the following general categories of pollution control measures:
1)
vegetated systems;
2)
spillage control;
3)
flow control; and,
4)
other pollution control mechanisms such as removal/separation of sediments or oils.
8.6.3
Where site conditions allow the use of vegetated systems their use should be prioritised over other
forms of treatment.
NOTE
Further detail on the design of vegetated systems can be found in CD 532 [Ref 28.N].
8.6.4
Where verge space restricts the use of vegetated systems, the use of conventional drainage systems,
either independently or in combination with vegetated systems should be reviewed.
NOTE 1
The advantages and disadvantages of a selection of pollution control measures are presented in
Appendix B.
NOTE 2
A high proportion of highway pollutants are found to be adsorbed to the fine silt fraction of the
suspended solids. By collecting, filtering and treating the fine sediment that is subsequently removed,
the system deals with a significant part of the runoff pollution.
8.6.5
Where the estimated probability of a major spillage is assessed at less than 1% annually (using LA 113
[Ref 20.N]), non-mechanical methods of pollution control should be used.
NOTE
Non-mechanical methods of pollution control such as check dams, booms or notch weirs, requiring little
maintenance, are more suitable than mechanical devices such as penstocks or gate valves, which are
more susceptible to vandalism and can become ineffective through lack of use.
8.7
Oil separators shall not be used.
8.7.1
Existing oil separators should be replaced by an alternative solution for mitigating the potential impacts
of road runoff.
NOTE 1
Oil separators are designed to mitigate oils and cannot be relied upon to treat suspended solids or
dissolved metals.
NOTE 2
Oil separators require regular maintenance to function effectively.
Signage of pollution control devices
8.8
Signs marking the location of pollution control devices are labelled as PCD (pollution control device)
and shall be designed in accordance with BS EN 12899-1 2007 [Ref 15.N].
8.9
The faces of pollution control signs (PCS) used shall be one of the options shown in Figure 8.9 and
meet the requirements shown in Table 8.9.

Appendix A. Drainage option advantages and disadvantages
Table A.1 Advantages and disadvantages of drainage options
Drainage collector detail
Advantages
Disadvantages
Combined channel and
pipe drains
1) provide extra flow capacity than for a channel of
the same width, reducing the number of outlets
from the system and reducing, or even
eliminating, the need for a separate carrier pipe;
2) where space is limited (for example, in road
widening schemes) they allow a narrower
channel to be built than would otherwise be
possible;
3) suited to in situ construction in concrete using
slip forming techniques;
4) they can remove the need for a separate carrier
drain in the verge and can enable flow to be
carried longer distances between outlets.
1) pipes follow the gradient of the road and
consequently can be quite flat allowing build-up
of sediment;
2) slots (where present) can become blocked with
sediment restricting inflow;
3) slots (where present) reduce the efficiency of any
jetting to clear sediment.
Surface drainage
Combined kerb
and drainage system
1) their use at roundabouts removes the need for
any 'false' crowning of road-edge channels;
2) they may be economic in rock cuttings, as a
cheaper option compared to carrier drain
installation;
3) useful on roads with relatively flat gradients (see
DMRB CD 525 [Ref 5.N]);
4) useful in urban areas where there is a high
incidence of utility services because they do not
need as great a depth of excavation as piped
system (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]).
1) prone to the build-up of sediment and debris
which can impede flow into and within the system
(see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
2) less robust than solid kerbs of equivalent
dimensions (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
3) require linear maintenance procedures taking
longer and requiring additional traffic
management and lane closure than the point
maintenance of gully sucking;
4) at roundabouts their maintenance requires
complex lane closure with traffic management.

CG 501 Version 2.2.0
Appendix A. Drainage option advantages and disadvantages
Table A.1 Advantages and disadvantages of drainage options (continued)
Drainage collector detail
Advantages
Disadvantages
Grassed surface
water channels
1) ability to treat pollution (see CD 521 [Ref 17.N]);
2) peak discharge flow rate to a receiving
watercourse will be less from the grassed
channel, (see CD 521 [Ref 17.N]).
1) prone to rutting resulting from vehicular over
running;
2) require regular maintenance (grass cutting),
which involves potential risk to operatives.
Informal drainage
(over the edge)
1) cost effective and easily maintained solution in
rural settings
1) can cause soil erosion, topsoil slippage,
softening of the side slopes and embankment
instability (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
2) uncontrolled growth on verges can inhibit free
drainage;
3) inappropriate for usage in locations where
footways or segregated cycleways abut
carriageways;
4) only suitable for embankments < 1 m high (see
CD 524 [Ref 14.N]).
Surface drainage
Kerbs and gullies
1) a longitudinal gradient to carry road surface
runoff to outlet is not dependent upon the
longitudinal gradient of the road itself and can be
formed instead within a longitudinal carrier pipe;
2) different types of gully are available that provide
for varying degrees of entrapment of detritus;
3) kerbs provide some structural support during
pavement laying and protect footpaths and
verges from vehicular overrun.
1) gullies can become blocked due to lack of
maintenance;
2) side-entry gullies are inefficient;
3) the permitted width of channel flow may
significantly reduce the spacing between gullies
when used on high speed roads.

Drainage collector detail
Advantages
Disadvantages
Linear drainage
channels
1) may be used in both verges and central reserves
on motorways; (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]).
1) linear drainage channels built on relatively flat
gradients are prone to the build-up of sediment
and debris (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]).
Surface drainage
Surface water
channels
1) relatively easy maintenance;
2) long lengths can be constructed quickly and fairly
inexpensively;
3) it may be possible to locate channel outlets at
appreciable spacings, and possibly coincident
with watercourses;
4) the risk to vehicles and occupants impinging on
surface water channels is lower than for other
types of surface drainage;
5) suited to in-situ construction in concrete using
slip forming techniques (not blocks).
1) carriageways with flat longitudinal gradients may
necessitate discharge of channels fairly
frequently into outlets or parallel longitudinal
carrier pipes in order to minimise the size of the
channels;
2) presence of features such as safety fences,
services, lighting columns and signs may restrict
ability to use;
3) ability to install long channel lengths may be
prevented by discontinuities in the verge/central
reserve such as piers, abutments, slip roads,
junctions, laybys, central reserve crossover
points, emergency crossing points or changes in
superelevation.

Surface drainage
Surface water
channels with channel
blocks
1) It may be possible to locate channel outlets at
appreciable spacings and possibly coincident
with watercourses;
2) suited to use on steep embankments (Types D, E
and F) (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
3) suitable where positive drainage is desirable for
dealing with small volumes of flow that would not
justify use of the larger surface water channel.
(Types A and B) (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]).
1) effectiveness of drainage channel blocks is
reduced by settlement of adjacent unpaved
surfaces;
2) drainage channel blocks are prone to the
build-up of sediment and debris in flat areas;
3) presence of drainage channel blocks may reduce
ability to undertake mechanical grass cutting;
4) should be avoided in verges subject to frequent
usage by equestrians or other vulnerable users;
5) presence of features such as safety fences,
services, lighting columns and signs may restrict
ability to use;
6) ability to install long channel lengths may be
prevented by discontinuities in the verge/central
reserve such as piers, abutments, slip roads,

Advantages
Disadvantages
Combined
surface
and
subsurface
drainage
Combined surface
and subsurface drains
(filter drains)
1) can be installed early in the construction phase
and be used to manage drainage during
construction (with appropriate maintenance);
2) they remove groundwater to a greater depth
beneath pavement level than fin or narrow filter
drains;
3) easier to construct than a solution with both
surface and sub-surface drainage constructed
separately;
4) easier inspection and maintenance than fin or
narrow filter drains;
5) allow collection of water from drainage systems
installed separately in the side-slopes of cuttings;
6) enable rapid removal of runoff from the road and
verge surface (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
7) can manage a wide range of flows (see CD 524
[Ref 14.N]);
8) particularly suited to dealing with subsurface
water flows, which can vary as the water table
fluctuates (see CD 524 [Ref 14.N]);
9) generally have an exceptionally large
groundwater capacity which can extend as a
cut-off below the capping layer (see CD 524 [Ref
14.N]);
10) removes sediment and attached pollutants
providing a degree of water quality treatment.
1) surface failure of embankments and pavement
failures;
2) risk of stone scatter where subject to vehicular
over run.

Advantages
Disadvantages
Fin drain
1) can be installed at the edge of the unbound
pavement construction allowing a range of edge
collection systems to be constructed above.
1) can be unsuitable for dealing with high
groundwater flows or where a longitudinal carrier
drain is necessary to transport surface-water
runoff from the carriageways. (See CD 524 [Ref
14.N]);
2) ground stability issues are possible during
excavation of and working within the narrow
trenches needed for Types 5, 6 and 7 (See CD
524 [Ref 14.N]).
Sub-surface
drainage
Narrow filter drain
1) can be installed at the edge of the unbound

collection systems to be constructed above.
1) can be unsuitable for dealing with high

Design notes
Combined kerb and
drainage channels
1) they can attenuate flow due to the
high storage capacity of their design;
2) their use can reduce the size of
attenuation storage or retention ponds
where utilised in combination with
each other.
1) sediment drop out can occur at inlets
resulting in road-edge debris requiring
additional road sweeping
maintenance;
2) standard jetting operations result in
large loss of water from the kerb units.
This may increase time on site and
vehicle movements as well as
resulting in debris spreading across
the carriageway and thus additional
road sweeping maintenance.
1) Check catchment sediment load and
gradients of drainage to confirm they
have suitable load carrying capacity.
Combined surface and
subsurface drains
1) They can provide spillage
containment if adequate downstream
control, such as a penstock or
handstop, is provided;
2) The filter media can adsorb
suspended solid pollutants and heavy
hydrocarbons, reducing downstream
pollution risk from routine runoff;
3) Inclusion of an over-sized carrier
drain can provide flow control.
1) Where routine runoff causes a
build-up of pollutant in the filter media,
maintenance requirements may be
increased (see CD 525 [Ref 5.N]);
2) Maintenance or replacement of filter
media may be needed if contaminated
by a serious accidental spillage;
3) Risk of stone scatter where subject to
vehicular over run.

Design notes
Ditches
1) Unlined ditches can allow infiltration
of runoff through soil and vegetation,
particularly where residence times are
long.
2) Lined ditches can act as containment
basins if located between the road
drain and receiving watercourses.
1) Scientifically robust information on
their treatment performance is limited.
2) Ditches with concrete or similar facing
do not have the same treatment
potential as unlined ditches, but can
be adapted to contain spillages.
3) Where unlined ditches are located
above permeable strata, there is a
risk that highway runoff will infiltrate
and potentially contaminate any
underlying aquifer.
4) Unlined ditches encourage vegetation
growth that can hamper access and
operational ability as well as giving an
increased maintenance requirement.
1) The direct input of a pollutant to
groundwater without percolation
through soil or subsoil is an offence
under Section 12(1) of the
Environmental Permitting Regulations
UKSI 2016/1154 [Ref 2.I];
2) Ditches with shallow side slopes have
similar properties to swales.
3) Where lined ditches are used as
containment basins they should have
a minimum of 25 m3 capacity and
have a downstream control that can
be shut or blocked in the event of
accidental spillage of pollutants on the
road.
Over the edge drainage
1) It can provide, in some
circumstances, a degree of pollution
control as highway runoff is allowed to
filter through vegetation on the slope.
2) Pollution control is possible with over
the edge drainage, using a
downstream control.
1) Where over the edge drainage is used
above permeable strata, there is a
risk that highway runoff will infiltrate
and potentially contaminate any
underlying aquifer.
1) Toe ditches associated with over the
edge drainage can be lined to prevent
percolation through the soil or subsoil.

Advantages
Disadvantages
Design notes
Kerbs and gullies
1) ability to capture potentially
contaminated sediments during
normal rainfall events prior to
discharge into a receiving
watercourse;
2) provide initial stage of interception of
spillages.
1) less effective at trapping finer grained
sediment than coarser grained
sediment;
2) high inflow rates can cause
resuspension of sediments and
mixing of oils with the water in the
gully pot;
3) contaminated water can discharge
from the gully pot into the receiving
drainage network or watercourse.
1) resuspension or mixing of oils can be
avoided by ensuring that the gradient
of the pipe leading to the gully is as
shallow as possible whilst still
providing adequate hydraulic
performance;
2) sumpless gullies should be
considered where this is not possible.
Penstocks and
handstops
1) They can provide spillage
containment if they are closed in time.
1) Failure to open penstock after a
spillage incident (or closure of
penstock due to vandalism or
equipment failure etc) could result in
flooding or scouring following breach
of the headwall or ditch.
2) regular maintenance needed;
3) handstops not appropriate for larger
systems.
1) The size of handstops should be such
that the plate can be lifted manually.
Piped systems
1) They can provide spillage
containment if adequate downstream
control such as penstock or handstop
is provided.

Reservoir pavements
1) They can allow full infiltration of
surface water into the subgrade or
partial infiltration combined with
capture for controlled release
elsewhere;
2) can provide economical drainage
solution.
1) only permitted in locations outside the
main trafficked lanes (see CD 531
[Ref 19.N]).
1) Use in main trafficked lanes requires
departure from standard.
Sedimentation tanks
1) They are not reliable for the removal
of dissolved copper and zinc.
1) Efficiency of sediment removal
depends on factors such as inflow
velocity, separator size, retention
time, maintenance frequency and
settlement time of individual particles.
2) not be relied upon to remove
dissolved copper and zinc.
Surface water channels
Surface water channels
with channel blocks
1) Where channels are not
self-cleansing, deposition of gross
pollutants and sediments is likely to
occur;
2) Ponding of water behind such
deposited material can cause safety
threat to road users.
1) To avoid sediment build up, designs
to ensure that surface water channels
are self-cleansing and sediments
deposited in a downstream system;
2) channels designed so that emergency
response kits can be used in them
and can act as a pollution control
measure for spillages.

Weirs and baffles
1) They can act as both pollution and
flood control devices.
2) Baffles can be placed in both open
channels and ditches.
1) Where weirs are used for spillage
control, they should be designed with
a notch or orifice that can readily be

Climate change allowances
E/1.1
For the design of carriageway drainage of drained areas up to 5 km2, the 'central' climate change
allowance for peak rainfall intensity for the 3.3% annual exceedance probability events for the 2070s
epoch shall be used, determined by the Environment Agency's management catchment most relevant
to the carriageway location, as given in the Environment Agency's climate change allowances guidance
CCA(E) [Ref 1.N].
E/1.2
A sensitivity test shall be undertaken, using the 'upper end' climate change allowance for peak rainfall
intensity for the 3.3% annual exceedance probability events for the 2070s epoch, determined by the
Environment Agency's management catchment most relevant to the carriageway location, as given in
the Environment Agency's climate change allowances guidance CCA(E) [Ref 1.N].
E/1.3
For the design and sensitivity test of carriageway drainage for drained areas greater than 5 km2, the
climate change allowances for peak river flows identified in the CCA(E) [Ref 1.N]shall be used.
E/1.4
For the design of drainage assets which affect the flow, morphology or discharge to a waterbody, the
climate change allowance applied shall be in accordance with the requirements of LA 113 [Ref 3.N].
