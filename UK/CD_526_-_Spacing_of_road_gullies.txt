Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the requirements and advice for determining the spacing of road grating and
kerb inlets for removing surface water from the carriageway within an acceptable width of channel flow.
The research upon which the design methodologies described in Appendix B and C are based is
detailed in HRW SR 533 [Ref 5.I].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
The limiting factor determining the spacing between road gullies is normally taken to be the inlet
capacity of the overlying grating rather than the underlying gully pot or associated pipework. See also
Appendix C8.
The hydraulic design method in this document assumes that the gap between the kerb and the first
slot(s) of a gully grating is not greater than 50mm.
Road profiling and gradients determine gully locations on roundabouts; refer to CG 501 [Ref 2.N] for
further information.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements, advice and design methodologies contained within this document shall apply for
determining the spacing of road grating and kerb inlets to the range of longitudinal gradients between
0.33% (1/300) and 6.67% (1/15).
1.1.1
The requirements, advice and design methodologies for determining the spacing of road grating and
kerb inlets may be extended to a longitudinal gradient of 8.0% (1/12.5) in accordance with HRW SR
533 [Ref 5.I].
NOTE 1
Flat longitudinal gradients are unavoidable in some situations and road gullies can offer advantages
over surface water channels in this situation as the gradient to carry road runoff from a gully to an
outfall is not dependent on the gradient of the road.
NOTE 2
For long lengths of flat gradient, grating and kerb outlets do not always provide the optimum drainage
solution.
NOTE 3
Further information on the design of gully spacings for the drainage of level or nearly level roads is
given in TRL LR 602 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 4
Kerb drainage system having continuous slots or closely-spaced holes that discharge into a
longitudinal pipe or channel formed within the kerb unit (combined kerb and drain unit) are outside the
scope of this document.
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the use of gully gratings and
kerb outlets to remove runoff from the carriageway on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and
all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 5.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.
1.4
Safety risk mitigation measures shall follow the ERIC hierarchy - Eliminate, Reduce, Isolate and
Control for each identified safety risk.

2.
Design principles
2.1
The hydraulic design of road gratings and kerb inlets shall fulfil the requirements set out in this section.
2.2
The flow of water parallel to the kerb shall not exceed an allowable flow width (see reference to B in
Figures 2.2 and 2.4).
Figure 2.2 Flow width of water against kerb
2.3
When checked for a 1 in 5 year storm as described in CG 501 [Ref 2.N] the allowable flow width B shall
not exceed 1.5m for the hard shoulder or lay-by, or 1.0m for the hard strip.
NOTE
An excessive flow width can be a danger to traffic.
2.4
The grating of the gully or kerb inlet shall collect as much of the approaching flow as possible.
Efficiency η (%) is expressed as the water flow down the grating or inlet as a percentage of the
approaching flow (Figure 2.4).

3. Types of gully grating
3.
Types of gully grating
3.1
Gully gratings shall comply with the requirements outlined in BS EN 124:1994 [Ref 3.N] .
NOTE 1
The hydraulic capacity of a gully grating depends on its overall size, the number and orientation of the
slots and the total waterway area provided by the slots.
NOTE 2
For requirements relating to the design of gully tops see CD 534 [Ref 1.N].
3.2
Gully gratings shall be rectangular or triangular with one side adjacent to the kerb.
3.2.1
The kerb face of the frame should be hard against the kerb.
3.2.2
The portion of the total waterway area within 50mm of the kerb should not be less than 45 cm2, in
accordance with BS 7903 [Ref 3.I].
NOTE
The hydraulic design method in this document assumes that the gap between the kerb and the first
slot(s) of a gully grating is not greater than 50mm.
3.2.3
The minimum area of waterway should be 900 cm2.
3.2.4
There should be a minimum waterway area of 65 cm2 between the kerb face of the frame and a parallel
line 90 mm distant.
3.3
Circular gully gratings, and any shapes that are highly asymmetric in a direction transverse to the kerb,
shall not be used.
3.4
Grating slots shall be orientated so as not to pose a hazard to cyclists riding over them in the direction
of travel.
NOTE
BS EN 124:1994 [Ref 3.N]allows grating slots parallel to the kerb which can present a serious hazard to
cyclists.
3.5
Classification of gratings shall be determined by the method of calculation in Appendix A, based upon
the geometric characteristics of the grating.
NOTE 1
In order to deal with the large number of possible designs that can be produced, Appendix A sets out a
method of classifying gratings based on their hydraulic characteristics - Types P, Q, R, S or T in
decreasing hydraulic capacity. The advantage of this approach is that a grating type can be specified
during design, ensuring the required hydraulic performance whatever type of conforming grating is
chosen during construction.
NOTE 2
If a manufacturer wishes to carry out hydraulic tests to determine the classification of a grating, a
suitable test procedure is described in HRW SR 533 [Ref 5.I].
3.5.1
Where a gully grating is under performing hydraulically, it may be more cost effective to install a more
efficient grating than install an additional gully.

4. Types of kerb inlet
4.
Types of kerb inlet
4.1
Kerb inlet covers and frames shall be Class D400 or stronger, in accordance with BS EN 124:1994 [Ref
3.N].
NOTE 1
Kerb inlets tend to have lower flow collection capacity than a gully grating of similar length. This is
because the lower velocity of flow along a kerb channel limits the proportion of total flow that is able to
turn into the opening provided by the kerb inlet.
NOTE 2
A method of increasing the efficiency of a kerb inlet is to create a longer opening parallel to the
direction of flow by recessing the upstream kerb line and setting the kerb inlet at a greater angle to the
flow (see Figure 4.1.1).
NOTE 3
For requirements relating to the design of kerb-type gully tops see CD 534 [Ref 1.N].
4.1.1
To prevent flow separating from the recessed section of kerb, the angle β in Figure 4.1.1 should be no
greater than 14º, corresponding to an expansion angle of 1:4.

Factors affecting hydraulic design
5.1
The hydraulic parameters of channels, gratings and inlets shall be evaluated in accordance with this
section before commencing the design procedure.
5.2
An initial assumption about the most suitable grating type (P to T) for a particular scheme shall be
made, and upgraded if it does not prove satisfactory.
5.3
The Manning roughness coefficient of the channel (n) shall be taken as no less than 0.017 for an
asphalt surface.
NOTE
Values for Manning's n for different drainage channel materials are given in Table 5.3N.

5.4
The location of specific gullies shall first be fixed by the requirements and advice given in this section.
5.4.1
The location and spacing for any intermediate gullies may be determined by the design methods given
in Appendix B and Appendix C.
5.5
Calculations shall commence at the crests or highest point of the scheme and proceed downhill.
NOTE
Design storm return periods are given in CG 501 [Ref 2.N].
Effect of performance reduction
5.6
A performance factor 'm' shall be included to allow for reduced grating efficiency.
NOTE 1
Reduced efficiency can be caused by the accumulation of debris that reduces the hydraulic area and
therefore the efficiency.
NOTE 2
The performance factor m has a value of 1.0 for no effect, and decreasing values for increasing levels
of risk.
NOTE 3
Values for m are given in Table 5.6N4.
NOTE 4
Site specific characteristics can determine the grating efficiency factor m to be used in the design.

5. Factors affecting hydraulic design
NOTE 1
Intermediate gullies are those for which some calculated proportion of the approaching flow can be
permitted to continue past the gully, to be picked up by the next gully downstream as shown in Figure
2.4. This is known as by-pass flow.
NOTE 2
Terminal gullies are those for which no significant proportion of the approaching flow is permitted to
pass the gully, either because there is no downstream gully or because the passing flow will interfere
with traffic.
5.8
Gully design shall allow future maintenance to be carried out safely and effectively.
5.9
Gully design shall not affect the safety of cyclists and other road users and will not impact upon traffic
flow.
5.10
Gullies shall be located so as not to pose a hazard to users of pedestrian, cycle or equestrian crossings.
5.11
Gullies shall be located so that there is no standing water at pedestrian, cycle or equestrian crossings.
NOTE 1
A particular problem occurs at sag points in gradients, both because floating debris will tend to
accumulate at this point, and because any water not entering a gully at this point cannot pass to
another gully.
NOTE 2
Where the crest along a length of road with changing longitudinal gradient is well defined, a gully is not
required at this point.
5.11.1
Where there is a slow transition from negative to positive gradient, a gully may be placed at the crest to
prevent any ponding of water.
NOTE
In cases such as the following it can be beneficial to install an additional upstream gully, designed to act
as a terminal gully:
1)
Transitions to superelevations.
2)
A pedestrian, cycle or equestrian crossing.
3)
For steeply angled road junctions.
5.12
Kerb inlets shall not be used as terminal gullies at sag points unless it is in combination with gratings.
Rainfall
5.13
The design rainfall intensity I (mm/h) shall be determined in accordance with the requirements
described in CG 501 [Ref 2.N].
5.13.1
Design rainfall intensity may also be determined from the formula given in CD 521 [Ref 4.N],
reproduced below:
Equation 5.13.1
I = 32.7(N −0.4)0.223
{
(T −0.4)0.5652 min M5
T
}
where:
I
Design rainfall intensity (mm/h)
N
Return period of design storm (years)
T
Critical storm duration (minutes)
2 min M5
Rainfall depth occurring at a location in a period of 2 minutes with an average
return period of 5 years (mm)
NOTE 1
The term 2minM5 describes the depth of rainfall (in mm) falling at a site over a period of 2 minutes, and
with an average return period of 5 years (i.e. an annual exceedance probability of 20%). This is a
measure of the rainfall characteristics at any given site and is reproduced in Figure E.1 in Appendix E.

5. Factors affecting hydraulic design
NOTE 2
Design values of the storm return period are given in CG 501 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE 3
Records indicate East Anglia and the South East experience lower Average Annual Rainfall than other
parts of the UK. However, these regions experience higher intensity and more frequent short duration
storms, particularly during summer months as demonstrated by the 2minM5 values shown in Figure
E.1.
NOTE 4
The critical storm duration T (in minutes) is the time of concentration of flow for the area served by the
gully.
NOTE 5
The critical storm duration T used for simple modelling purposes is generally recognised as 5 minutes.
NOTE 6
T can be significantly less than 5 minutes for gullies spaced at less than 10m intervals, and with
moderate to severe longitudinal gradients (more than 4%).
NOTE 7
T can be significantly greater than 5 minutes for gullies spaced at greater than 50m intervals, and with
flatter longitudinal gradients (less than 0.5%).
5.14
The value of T shall be checked for the shortest and longest drainage lengths between gullies.
5.14.1
The sum of the time taken for water to travel from the furthest point on the road surface to the kerb, ts ,
and then along the kerb to the gully, tg , should be approximately equal to T , as follows:
Equation 5.14.1
T = ts + tg
where:
T
critical storm duration (minutes)
ts
time for water to travel from the furthest point on the road surface to the kerb (minutes)
tg
time for water to travel along the kerb to the gully (minutes)
NOTE 1
A value of ts of 3 minutes is generally recommended. HRW WP [Ref 6.I](see Vol 1 section 7.10)
provides information on non-standard cases.
NOTE 2
For a reasonably uniform gradient, tg (in minutes) can be calculated from the flow velocity, V (in m/s)
and gully spacing:
Equation 5.14.1N2a
tg = Sp
60V
where:
tg
time for water to travel along the kerb to the gully (minutes)
Sp
gully spacing (m)
V
flow velocity along kerb (m/s)

Catchment width
5.15
All paved areas draining to the kerb shall be included in the catchment width.
NOTE
Paved areas can include hard shoulders, paved central reserves, footways, emergency refuge areas
and maintenance hard-standing. Roof drainage from buildings can also be included where it
discharges to road gullies.
5.15.1
The effective catchment width draining to the kerb channel, We (in m), may be determined from a plan
area of the site.
5.16
If the unpaved area exceeds the paved area then the methodology outlined in CD 521 [Ref 4.N] shall
be used to determine the effective catchment width draining to the kerb channel.
5.16.1
Where the unpaved area does not exceed the paved area, it may be accepted that runoff contribution
from unpaved areas equates to 20% that of an equivalent paved area.

Appendix A. Determining the grating type
Appendix A. Determining the grating type
A1
Introduction
When determining the grating type, the following three geometrical properties are determined first.
1)
The area Ag (in m2) of the smallest rectangle parallel to the kerb that just includes all the slots.
2)
The waterway area as a percentage (p) of the grating area Ag.
3)
The coefficient Cb determined from Table A1 below.
Bars more than 10mm below the surface of the grating are treated as part of the waterway area when
calculating the value of p. If a grating has a combination of bar alignments, the number of transverse
slots and the number of slots with other alignments are calculated. If there are more transverse slots
than other slots, Cb is be taken as 1.75; otherwise Cb is taken as 1.5.
Table A.1 Grating bar pattern
Grating bar pattern
Cb
Transverse bars
1.75
Other bar alignments - (i.e. longitudinal, diagonal and bars curved in plan)

The category into which a grating falls may then be determined from the value of the grating parameter
G (in s/m2):
Equation A.1
G =

where:

Cb
Coefficient for grating bar pattern
Ag
Area of smallest rectangle with two sides parallel to kerb that contains all the slots in the
grating (m2)
p
Waterway area as a percentage of grating area (%)
The grating type and the corresponding design value Gd of the grating parameter is then determined
from Table A2. The value of Gd should be used to calculate the maximum spacing between gullies,
rather than the actual value of G from Equation (A.1).

Appendix B. Use of tables for determining flow capacity of gullies
B1
Introduction
A series of design tables is given in Appendix D of this document. These can be used, subject to the
limitations indicated, to determine gully spacings with the minimum of calculation.
Alternatively the equations on which they are based are given in Appendix C of this document, and
these equations can be used directly.
It should be noted that the tables refer to spacing of intermediate gullies. The design of terminal gullies
is described at the end of this appendix.
B2
Hydraulic parameters
The following parameters are required:
1)
Values of the longitudinal gradient, SL, at points along the length of the scheme (expressed as
fractions in the design tables and calculations). For an individual length drained by a gully, SL
should be taken as the average gradient over a 3m distance upstream of the gully.
2)
The cross-fall, Sc, also expressed as a fraction in the tables and calculations. It is measured 0.5m
upstream of the leading edge of the gully and for the maximum permissible width of flow.
3)
The Manning roughness coefficient, n.
4)
The maximum allowable flow width against the kerb (B in m, see Figure 2.2).
5)
The grating type (P, Q, R, S or T), or the size and angle of kerb inlet.
Table D1 in Appendix D can be used to determine the discharge at the kerb immediately upstream of
the grating if required. For intermediate values of cross-fall and gradient, the flow may be either
interpolated or taken as the nearest higher value. For values of n other than 0.017, the flow should be
multiplied by 0.017/n.
B3
Maximum spacings for gully gratings
Tables D2 to D6 in Appendix D give the area of road that may be drained (Adr in m2) by an intermediate
gully for a rainfall intensity of 50mm/h, performance factor m = 1.0, and n = 0.017. Each of tables D2 to
D6 corresponds to one of grating types P to T. The actual area (Aa) that can be drained is then given by:
Equation B.1
Aa = Adr
(50
I
)
mkn
where:
Aa
Actual area that can be drained (m2) (see text above for clarification)
Adr
Maximum area that can be drained (m2) (see text above for clarification)
I
Design rainfall intensity (mm/h)
m
Performance factor
kn
Roughness and grating efficiency factor
It is sufficiently accurate, where the grating efficiency η at n = 0.017 is more than about 80%, to set kn to
0.017/n. The exact solution is:

Equation B.3
Sp = Aa
We
where:
Sp
Maximum allowable spacing between adjacent gullies (m)
Aa
Actual area that can be drained (m2)
We
Effective catchment width
These tables also give the flow collection efficiency η of the grating in % (in brackets). If η is below
about 60%, the grating is not very efficient, and the design should be reconsidered (see Appendix C).
The design method is intended to be applied over a range of η between 100 and 50%. Below 50%, it
becomes increasingly conservative.
Tables D2 to D6 are for intermediate gullies on a uniform gradient, and become inaccurate for gradients
which vary greatly over short distances. As a general guide, errors become significant if the gradients
between adjacent gullies change by more than two of the increments in the tables, and also if the
grating efficiency η is less than 80%. A more accurate calculation for this case is given in Appendix C.
B4
Maximum spacings for kerb inlets
Values of the catchment area (Adr in m2) that can be drained by 0.5m long and 1.5m long inlets installed
in the line of the kerb are given in tables D7 and D8 respectively. Table D9 applies to the case of a
0.5m long inlet installed at angles α = 50º and β = 14º as shown in Figure 4.1.1; this arrangement is
equivalent in performance to an in-line inlet providing a 1.85m long opening in the kerb. The values of
Adr given in the tables assume a rainfall intensity of I = 50 mm/h, a performance factor of m = 1.0 and a
channel roughness of n = 0.017. If other values of I or m apply, the actual area, Aa , that can be drained
will be different from Adr and may be calculated from Equation (B.1). If tables D7 to D9 show that the
flow collection efficiency, η, would be less than 60%, the use of either a longer kerb inlet or a suitable
gully grating is recommended. For a given length, a gully grating will usually be more efficient than a
kerb inlet.
The maximum allowable spacing between intermediate kerb inlets, Sp (in m), is calculated from
Equation (B.3) using the value of Aa (in m2) and the effective catchment width, We (in m).
The effect on the allowable drained area and spacing of assuming a different value of channel
roughness, n, may be estimated approximately by setting kn in Equation (B.1) to 0.017/n, provided the
flow collection efficiency given for n = 0.017 in the appropriate tables D7 to D9 exceeds η = 80%. If the
efficiency is lower the more accurate formula given in Equation (B.2) should be used.

Appendix B. Use of tables for determining flow capacity ...
The drained areas and spacings for other lengths of kerb inlet may be determined by applying an
appropriate factor kL to the values obtained from tables D7 to D9. Firstly the table for which the inlet
length, Li1 (in m), is closest to the required length, Li2 (in m) should be chosen. From the table, the flow
collection efficiency, η , corresponding to the length Li1 should be found, and the value of the factor kL
calculated from the formula:
Equation B.4
kL =
1.0 −
((
1.0 −
( η

))
η
100
where:
kL
Kerb inlet length factor
η
Flow collection efficiency (%)
Li1
Inlet length (m)
Li2
Required inlet length (m)
The actual drained area (Aa) and the maximum spacing distance (Sp) corresponding to the inlet length
Li1 should then be multiplied by the factor kL to find the corresponding values for the required inlet
length Li2.
B5
Terminal gullies
The procedure for designing different arrangements of terminal gullies is as follows:
1)
Single gully at sag point. There will be flow into the gully from both directions. Table D1 or
Equation (C.4) are used to determine which direction gives the greater flow. This flow is then
doubled, and Equation (C.5) or (C.8) is used to determine the flow collection efficiency η . For
effective drainage this is greater than 95%. The maximum allowable spacings upstream of the
gully is then checked using Equation (C.6) or (C.7).
2)
Twin gullies at sag point (the more efficient arrangement, possibly requiring fewer gullies
upstream). Use the tables or equations to determine the design spacing and η for each gully. η
will be greater than 95% for both gullies.
3)
Other terminal gullies (where it is not desirable for the flow to bypass the grating) The design
spacing upstream of the gully should be determined from the tables or equations. To avoid
excessive flow past the gully, η should be greater than 95%.

Introduction
Appendix C describes the equations used in the design procedure described in this document. They

gully spacings. These equations may readily be programmed, and in this form are very easy to use for
exploring the effects of changing the drainage parameters.

Q is the flow rate (in m3/s) in the kerb channel just upstream of the gully and is calculated using

in Figure 4.1.1, Li = 3.7 L.

C7
Effect of longitudinally varying gradient
If the longitudinal gradient of a kerb channel increases significantly with distance in the direction of flow,
it is necessary to check that the channel has sufficient flow capacity at all points along its length. If the
distance between two adjacent gullies is Z and the gradient at the downstream gully is SL as described
in Appendix B, then at any intermediate distance Zi from the upstream gully the local gradient Si should
satisfy the following requirement:
Equation C.9
Si > SL
(Zi
Z
)2
where:
Si
Longitudinal slope at distance Zi from upstream gully (m)
SL
Longitudinal gradient
Zi
Distance from upstream gully measured in downstream direction (m)
Z
Distance between adjacent gullies (m)
If the limit is not satisfied, an additional gully should be located at the point where the kerb channel has
insufficient capacity.
Note that the limit only needs to be checked if Si increases with Zi, the opposite of what might be
expected. The above requirement is independent of whether gratings or kerb inlets are used.
C8
Flow capacity of gully pots
On steeper sections of road, the maximum allowable spacing between gullies may not be determined
by the collection efficiency of the grating but by the flow capacity of the gully pot beneath it.

Appendix C. Use of equations for determining the flow ca...
Experimental tests in HRW SR 508 [Ref 4.I] indicate that the maximum flow rate that can be accepted
by a gully pot without surcharge is about 10 litres/s if the outlet pipe has a diameter of 100mm, and 15
litres/s if it has a diameter of 150mm. Table D1 in Appendix D gives estimated discharges at the kerb,
under a rainfall intensity of 50 mm/h, for combinations of flow width, crossfall and longitudinal gradient.
C9
Redesign
The design gully spacings determined from the design tables in Appendix C or by calculation are the
maximum spacings: good practice would aim to reduce this distance. If the design shows the gully
spacing or grating efficiency to be inadequate for the scheme, then redesign using one or more of the
following options.
1)
If the grating efficiency η is less than about 80% for an intermediate gully, the most effective
solution is likely to be redesign with an improved grating type.
2)
If the grating efficiency η of a terminal grating is less than 95%, redesign is essential. The first
step should be to redesign with an improved grating type. If the required efficiency is still not
achieved, the permitted width of kerb flow B should be replaced by a lesser design width. This
will have the effect of reducing the design flow approaching the grating and increasing the grating
efficiency, but may require the use of additional intermediate gullies.
Alternatively it may be more practical to adjust other parameters , e.g. changes in the road profile or the
catchment width.
