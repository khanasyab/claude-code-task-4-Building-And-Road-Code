Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides requirements and guidance which aim to improve the aesthetic outcomes of
schemes that include bridges and other highway structures. It outlines an underlying approach to
encourage best practice, establish intended outcomes that support aesthetic quality, and evidence how
these can be addressed throughout all stages of the design life-cycle of a highway structure.
The provisions in this document are not instructions for how to design good highway structures, but are
prompts for all parties involved throughout the design life-cycle to improve aesthetic quality and design
outcomes.
This document is intended for use by engineers, architects and planning professionals, as well as to
inform communities of the design philosophy and principles that can be implemented to ensure good
design.
Aesthetics is only one of the aspects affecting good road design, and has to be balanced with functional
and technological considerations covered in other DMRB documents as relevant.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be followed to demonstrate how the aesthetic quality has been taken into account
throughout the design life-cycle of all categories of highway structures for new construction and
renewal schemes.
NOTE 1
This document does not provide prescriptive rules or a formulaic approach on how the subject of
aesthetics is dealt with for highway structures; instead, it covers:
1) overarching aesthetic influences relevant to highway structures;
2) the process of identifying, evidencing and working towards positive aesthetic outcomes.
NOTE 2
Aesthetic impact is not limited to higher profile, landmark structures that stand out as a result of their
scale, location or role within their local cultural vernacular, but also to structures that are regarded as
commonplace, widespread and therefore highly visible elements within the highway network.
NOTE 3
The objectives and processes set out in this document are based on general principles of design
excellence and complement the principles of good road design established within GG 103 [Ref 1.N].
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the design and appearance of
highway structures on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according
to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 2.N].
Use of GG 101
1.3
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

life-cycle.
NOTE
The level of supporting detail and extent of content within the AAD increases from category AC1 to
category AC3 (see "Aesthetics category" in Section 3).
3.2.3
An AAD may be produced for individual structures or alternatively for a family of structures on a
scheme, where relevant.
3.2.4
Where aspects are covered within documents already required by other standards/processes, a
reference to the relevant, alternative source may be included in lieu of a detailed description.
NOTE
The AAD can be used to inform other formal procedures including technical approval, planning,
consents and environmental assessments.
3.3
Any amendments required as a result of the outcome of the consent process shall be recorded within
the AAD.
Aesthetic category
3.4
The level of detail and extent of content within the AAD shall be commensurate to the aesthetic
category (AC) of the structure.
NOTE 1
The aesthetic category of the structure is based on the underlying characteristics identified in Table
3.4N1 for AC1, AC2, AC3.
Table 3.4N1 Aesthetic category characteristics
Category
Characteristics
AC3
1) landmark structures that can generate significant local or national interest;
2) structures that have a significant visual effect (1) in locations with environmental,
heritage, landscape and visual sensitivities. For example structures in sensitive
areas as defined in LA 102 [Ref 3.N].
AC2
Structures that could be regarded as relatively widespread but are highly visible
elements in themselves, within the highway network, which can include:
1) structures that form grade separated junctions;
2) structures in densely populated areas or that are adjacent to or cross roads that
carry significant volumes of traffic;
3) structures that are adjacent to or cross recreational waterways;
4) structures that are adjacent to or cross routes used by walkers, horse riders and
cyclists, and shared used paths;
5) bridges that provide access to recreational areas/parks.
AC1
All others.
Note (1): Guidance and requirements on assessing the significance of visual effects is provided in LA
107 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 2
The initial aesthetic category of the structure in AAD1 is defined by the relevant Overseeing
Organisation.
NOTE 3
The aesthetic category is not the same as the structure category for technical approval, see CG 300
[Ref 4.N].
3.5
Any change to the initial aesthetic category from AAD1 shall be agreed with the relevant Overseeing
Organisation.

3. Aesthetic appraisal document
3.6
An evidence base appropriate to the aesthetic category allocated shall be developed through the
aesthetic evaluation process during the various design life-cycle stages.
Design outcome objectives
3.7
The design outcome objectives shall be defined no later than the AAD2 stage.
3.7.1
The design process should not start with any preconceptions about the aesthetics of the final solution.
NOTE
Different structure types have their own particular characteristics in terms of materials, components etc.
3.7.2
The key objectives for the design outcome should be understood and defined through a
multi-disciplinary design and review process, focusing on aspects such as:
1) proportion and integration of structure scale within the landscape;
2) options for contrast/harmony with surrounding environment;
3) proportions of spans/length and height;
4) symmetry/rhythm/line/order of principal elements;
5) materials and finishes;
6) parapets and other elements that contribute to rhythm;
7) lighting and signage;
8) managing the effects of water and weathering;
9) structure curtilage;
10) viewpoints from and to the structure;
11) potential for developing a family of structures along route.

Appendix A. Aesthetics aspects that can influence the design process
The following values relating to both substance and process should be integral to the design approach
in order to achieve structures of aesthetic merit:
1) commitment to aesthetics;
2) community/stakeholder engagement;
3) understanding of sensitivity of context;
4) balancing cost and aesthetics;
5) sustainability of outcomes;
6) rigour within the design process;
7) collaboration between all relevant disciplines.
A1
Commitment to aesthetics
All relevant parties should commit to achieving good aesthetics, including the client, the design team
and the contractor during the design life-cycle.
A2
Community/stakeholder engagement
Early engagement and regular communication with local communities should form part of the design
process.
Bridges in particular tend to be highly visible structures that are viewed not only by road users, but also
by local community members. As such, they can impact visual amenity and sense of place. They can
affect historic and cultural values or provide a sense of local identity.
A3
Understanding of sensitivity of context
The sensitivity to the way in which a structure sits within the landscape or built environment and its
ecological and community context should be assessed.
It should be understood through all design stages that, whilst the structure itself is a unity, the site and
the structure also represent a unity and therefore technical and aesthetic decisions should not be
separated from each other. There should always be an interaction between them.
A clear understanding of the broader context within which the structure sits that can influence the
designer's aesthetic response should be developed and documented. These may include:
1) topography;
2) function;
3) adjacent land use and infrastructure features;
4) the presence of other highway structures (either adjacent to or along route);
5) geotechnical and geological characteristics;
6) character of landscape or built environment;
7) ecology/biodiversity;
8) views of or in the case of bridges, from the structure;
9) community values and objectives.
A4
Cost and aesthetics
Cost and aesthetics should be balanced in order to develop an optimum solution.
Good design and aesthetics need not lead to an expensive outcome. Durability and build quality are
often related and drive whole life costs in terms of maintenance and serviceable life.

A5
Sustainability
The sustainability of outcomes should be evaluated as they can directly influence the aesthetic
outcome, insofar as they can be reflected by:
1) respect for heritage;
2) improved amenity for local communities;
3) connectivity of communities;
4) network resilience;
5) accommodation of inspection and maintenance;
6) longevity in terms of flexibility for future adaptation.
GG 103 [Ref 1.N] provides requirements and guidance for sustainable development and design.
A6
Coordination of disciplines within the design process
When the proposed solutions flow from an understanding of the fundamental design requirements,
context and design outcome objectives, the rationale for selecting a single preferred concept becomes
transparent.
It is particularly important that the highway design and structure design are well coordinated. The
structure should properly relate to the road and decisions that can fix the alignment and the land-take
requirements should not be made without the involvement of the structure designer.
The extent and shape of associated earthworks have a great effect on the structure design and on the
general landscape context, and their inter-relationship should be coordinated between the highway
designer, the structure designer and landscape architect. A predominant focus on earthworks and
alignment aspects can have a detrimental impact on structure aesthetics.
A7
Collaboration between all relevant disciplines
A collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach should be adopted to explore a range of feasible design
solutions and identify dependencies and wider opportunities. Collaboration between design
professionals across the full range of necessary disciplines and engagement from the start of the
design life-cycle should be facilitated to achieve a solution of aesthetic merit.
A highway structure is rarely designed by a single individual but will generally be the result of
interactions between designers from multiple disciplines. This collaboration should begin at the earliest
stage of design development in order to avoid outputs from one discipline becoming a constraint to
others. These dynamic interactions are key to arriving at a balance and optimal solution. Conflicts that
arise can be aired and resolved, resulting in a clearer path towards an optimal solution. For example,
an open aspect structure, whilst potentially having a cost penalty relative to earthworks, can bring both
aesthetic and environmental/ecological benefits and potentially reduce the costs of associated
mitigation measures.
Input to the design team should ideally be provided by the client, structural and highway engineers,
architect (where the aesthetic category merits this), landscape architect (where appropriate), with input
from environmental, operation & maintenance and construction engineering specialists and others, as
appropriate and identified in the AAD.
It is particularly important that the highway design and structure design are developed collaboratively
between both disciplines. The structure should relate properly to the road and decisions which fix its
alignment and associated land requirements should not be made without consulting the structure
designer, particularly in the case of major structures such as bridges.

Appendix B. Approach to the design - general
B1
Scope of application
This appendix provides guidance for all highway structures on the approach to design incorporating an
evaluation of all aspects that affect the aesthetic quality in general.
B2
Options development
It should be understood through all design stages that whilst a major highway structure such as a
bridge in itself is a unity (i.e. in which structure, construction, materials, appearance and function are
drawn together), the structure and its setting in the landscape are also a unity. Therefore technical and
aesthetic decisions cannot be taken in isolation from each other. There will always be an interaction
between them.
A highway structure will always become a component of its immediate environment. That environment
will encompass many aspects, one of which is the immediate physical location (i.e. the site). The site
will provide the most important influences with regard to what the appearance of the structure should
be, or perhaps what it should not be. This will be a combination of technical, functional and aesthetic
influences.
When approaching the design of any highway structure there will always be numerous options for
solutions. The design process should therefore begin by developing a clear understanding of the full
context within which the structure will sit, but keeping an open mind when developing options. Not all of
these will be apparent at an early stage, and the most appropriate solutions may not become obvious
until a good deal of effort has been expended.
Good design requires time and deep understanding of aesthetic, functional and technical
considerations in order to fully understand and sensitively deal with potentially conflicting project
requirements or constraints. Designers are normally expected to study alternative solutions
undertaking preliminary analysis and cost estimates, to provide appropriate data to allow valid
comparisons of solutions to be made. The first solution that comes to mind is rarely sufficiently
developed to be considered as optimal; other options should be developed in parallel in order to identify
the most appropriate solution that best satisfies the requirements of the client and users.
B3
The whole
A clear understanding of aspects of the broader context within which the structure sits that can
influence the designer's aesthetic response should be developed and recorded. These can include:
1) topography;
2) function;
3) adjacent land use and infrastructure features;
4) the presence of other highway structures (either adjacent to or along the route);
5) geotechnical and geological characteristics;
6) character of landscape or built environment;
7) ecology/biodiversity;
8) views of or in the case of bridges, from the structure;
9) community values and objectives.
The design process should not start with any preconceptions about the final solution. The key
objectives for the design outcome should be developed and defined through a multi-disciplinary review
process, focusing on aspects such as:
1) integration of structure scale within the landscape;
2) proportions of spans and height;
3) symmetry/rhythm;

Appendix B. Approach to the design - general
4) potential for developing a family of structures along a route.
Different structure types will have their own particular characteristics in terms of materials, components
etc. The nature of use will significantly influence the structure type and form. For example,
pedestrian/cycle bridges will be lighter and hence more flexible structures than highway or rail bridges.
In the case of highway structures, the shaping of abutting earthworks, whilst not part of the structure 
itself, should also be carefully considered. LD 117 [Ref 3.I] provides guidance on the interaction 
between bridges and landscape. Three dimensional graphics or simple physical models can be helpful 
in relating the embankment to the shape and scale of the structure within the landscape.
The structure itself should also be considered as a whole, not just an assemblage of parts. All elements
should be related and all the parts be compatible with each other, serving the whole. For example, in
the case of bridges, incompatibilities between approach viaducts (or ramps in the case of pedestrian
structures) and the main structure should always be avoided through consideration of the whole.
Significant elements that have disparate angular arrangements within a structure can produce a
disorganised effect, and truss type structures require particular care.
The form of the structure is what gives it its fundamental character. It is intimately connected with
materials and the methods of construction as well as with safety and durability. Generally a structure
should honestly and skilfully reflect the use of form and materials to achieve its aesthetic effect, by
refinement of form and details.
Generally, forms and details that reflect the flow of internal forces are preferred to those which do not
and therefore appear forced. For example, arches and suspension bridges reflect the flow of internal
forces and are generally considered to be visually dramatic.This is equally as valid when designing
contemporary structures as it was for historic ones.
B4
The parts
The form of the structure will encompass its external shape and overall appearance and how its
individual elements are arranged and interrelate to one another in terms of scale and proportion.
Structure specific guidance is given in Appendix C and D.

Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
C1
Scope of application
This appendix provides guidance specific to bridges on the approach to design incorporating an
evaluation of all aspects that affect the aesthetic quality.
C2
The parts
The primary elements within a typical bridge can be grouped into:
1) superstructure;
2) substructure.
The following sections are not intended to be a comprehensive list of the parts to all types of bridge, but
provide a brief commentary on the main elements that usually dominate aesthetic considerations. More
detailed guidance may be found in the 1998 edition of BA 41 The Design and Appearance of Bridges.
C3
Superstructure
Superstructure elements can include:
1) above deck elements, for example pylons or arch ribs;
2) bridge deck;
3) parapets;
4) other deck furniture.
The bridge deck is usually the main visual organising element that links all other elements together and
emphasises structural continuity.
C3.1
Bridge deck depth
By thoughtful shaping of the structure, the visual impact of the depth of the deck can be reduced
(except in silhouette). These measures can help to lighten the appearance of the deck, which is usually
positive but this may not necessarily always be the case.
Edge cantilevers overhanging the main structural elements can break up the visible depth of the deck,
as the recession of the main structure and the shadow cast on it by the cantilever reduces the
perceived overall depth.
C3.2
Bridge deck width
One of the challenges of modern highway bridges is that their decks can be very wide. Large areas of
unbroken soffit tend to be visually dominant and potentially unpleasant, particularly where the soffit is
relatively low and highly visible to users of the spaces beneath.
Edge cantilevers overhanging the main structural elements are usually, but not always, beneficial
insofar as they reduce the visual impact of the width of the deck soffit, particularly where decks are set
low within the landscape.
In the case of bridges carrying dual carriageways, the effects of large areas of unbroken soffit can be
mitigated by accommodating the carriageways on separate decks with a gap between them that allows
light to penetrate. Where this is not possible a main structure consisting of visibly separated beams or
boxes may be favourable.
C3.3
Bridge deck length
Ideally the bridge deck should run throughout its length as cleanly as possible, i.e. sudden changes of
depth or width should be avoided. If they are unavoidable, steps should be taken to minimise their
effect, possibly by means of a strong dividing element as a transition.
20

======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 53
======================================================================
CD 351 Revision 0
Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
An awkward effect is produced by an abrupt change of structure within a length of viaduct to
accommodate a change in form, where structures of different sizes or types are juxtaposed without any
transition element. If it is not possible to avoid an awkward junction at such a change in the structure,
the two decks should be visually separated by another element.
C4
Substructure
Substructure elements can include:
1) piers;
2) pier head interface;
3) pilecap interface;
4) abutments.
C4.1
Piers
Generally, piers should be simple in form and where complex or elaborate solutions are adopted, the
rational for departing from this approach should be recorded. If different forms of piers are adopted
within the bridge they should be visually related to each other in some way.
C4.1.1
Pier form and placement
The form and placing of piers in relation to the deck should be carefully considered. Two examples of
this are:
1) thin piers under a very thick deck can look discontinuous and visually awkward;
2) where the deck is of constant depth the piers can be inset from the edge in order to emphasise the
visual flow of the deck and reduce the significance of the piers and their spacing.
C4.1.2
Pier shapes
Pier shapes should be carefully considered, not only in relation to each other but also in relation to the
shape of the deck and how the two interact at their point of connection. There may also be situations
where surrounding features dictate a specific visual response.
Piers with cross section that have a rectangular core with semi-circular ends tend to be less visually
pleasing than those which have a cross section defined by a continuous curve, such as an ellipse.
C4.2
Abutments
Abutments provide a vital visual end stop to the bridge and create its transition into the landscape.
Careful consideration is therefore needed in terms of how they frame the structure and interact with its
form, rhythm and scale.
For rural bridges it is often preferable to have simple bank seats that are much less visually obtrusive
and avoid the problems associated with large visible areas of concrete, but this may not always be
possible.
From a road user's point of view, closed abutments provide more contained and focused views along
the highway corridor, which can be an advantage in certain situations. The proportions of the opening
then become particularly significant.
C5
The details
C5.1
Surfaces and weathering
An important factor in the appearance of surfaces is the way in which they weather.
All materials weather, including brick and stone, and can weather badly if not appropriately
selected/specified or detailed. Careful consideration of the detailing between interfaces is necessary
where combinations of different materials are used.

======================================================================
CD 351 Revision 0
Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
Concrete surfaces require the most attention, particularly large unrelieved concrete surfaces such as
often found in large abutments or retaining walls, which are by their nature aesthetically challenging.
Edge cantilevers can help protect the main structure from the adverse effects of weathering.
C5.1.1
Effects of water flow
The majority of the undesirable visual consequences of weathering result from exposure to water
through various mechanisms such as rain, condensation or spray created by moving vehicles, either
through unevenly depositing dirt particles on a surface or by redistributing them through washing of the
surface.
The designer should consider the way in which water will flow over the element surfaces and try to
actively manage it as much as possible. In doing this it is necessary to think in three dimensions. For
example, it is not uncommon to see cross sections with drips detailed on them where no provision has
been made to cater for the resulting flow of water along the direction of the drip, at its termination.
C5.1.2
Drip details
Drips will inevitably slope in their longitudinal dimension and water may run, or be blown along them
until it hits a surface that it can run down, such as a pier or abutment. If it can be sensitively
accommodated, a vertical feature in the face of the pier or abutment may be employed to contain any
potential streaking. Deck soffits often exhibit unsightly streaking from water driven onto girder webs.
Where edge cantilevers and properly detailed drip features are incorporated, the deck can generally be
protected from water running from above.
If a fascia incorporates joints (as is common with precast elements) water may eventually penetrate the
joint and bypass the drip. A secondary drip in the soffit of the slab behind the fascia can protect the
main structure, not only from water which gets through the joint in the fascia, but also from water
flowing over the edge of the deck before the fascia is constructed that may carry particles of rust or
other debris from construction related materials and activities on the deck.
C5.1.3
Vertical faces
Elements with vertical faces such as fascia panels, piers and abutments are most vulnerable,
particularly in urban environments. Careful detailing incorporating special finishes can help to control
and minimise the effects of staining or streaking.
A projection from a vertical surface will inhibit water from washing over the surface immediately below
it. A projection of limited length will have a darker unwashed area beneath it, which is likely to contrast
with the rest of the surface.
C5.1.4
Concrete surfaces
Smooth concrete surfaces often weather badly, regardless of the surface quality achieved. No matter
how uniform the surface appears to be, water may flow down in irregular paths resulting in random
streaks.
Textured surfaces perform markedly better, for example when tooled or cast against sawn board
formwork. Some proprietary form liners may also produce surfaces which avoid streaking, but many
will incorporate a pattern that repeats in consecutive panels, which itself may be visually inappropriate.
Surfaces with closely spaced vertical ribs or grooves can work effectively to channel the water so that it
cannot spread out to cause streaks.
Finishes that are used to prevent water runs from streaking concrete surfaces may also be considered
as opportunities to give texture to the surface.
C5.1.5
Use of trial panels
There is often considerable merit in including the requirement for the production of full-scale trial panels
when structures incorporate highly visible concrete surfaces or features. These should be constructed
on site by the contractor as far in advance of the works to which they relate as can be reasonably

accommodated within the programme in order to allow modifications to be made if necessary based on
their outcomes.
The trial panel will serve numerous functions from testing of the designer's decisions in terms of colour,
surface textures and weathering behaviour as well as of the contractor's ability to deliver the designer's
intent. They can also provide invaluable insights in terms of verifying the proposed construction
methods, the suitability of the reinforcement detailing, the formwork finishes and the suitability of the
concrete mix itself.
CS 171 [Ref 5.I] provides guidance on concrete trial panels.
C5.1.6
Weathering steel
The use of weathering steel poses particular challenges and water that has been in contact with it
should be carefully managed such that it does not come into contact with any adjacent concrete
surfaces.
Guidance on detailing of weathering steel can be found in CD 361 [Ref 6.I].
C5.2
Joints
The location and detailing of expansion joints should be carefully considered in the design. Generally
these should be avoided as far as is possible to circumvent any associated durability or weathering
problems. Joints will inevitably leak during their service life and the structure should therefore be
detailed such that any leakage can be contained or managed in a way that does not result in unsightly
staining.
Leakage of joints is far more straightforward to manage at abutments than over piers or within a span.
C5.3
Parapets
Parapets serve several core functions, including:
1) safely containing people or vehicles or other objects;
2) giving a sense of security to users of the bridge;
3) providing a visual edge to the deck as seen from off the bridge;
4) allowing bridge users to experience the landscape.
Too often only the first of these is given any significant degree of attention, both during design and
when preparing and interpreting standards.
High containment parapets are difficult to accommodate visually and should be carefully considered,
especially where (as is often the case), they are not continuous over the full length of the bridge. Where
the related element proportions allow, it may be feasible to express the continuity of the bridge fascia
by means of a shadow line and possibly a change of texture.
A parapet that is at least partly of concrete can provide a thicker element as part of the edge of the deck.
The parapet is the most brightly lit part of the deck as seen from off the bridge and varying the height of
this element can be an important tool in influencing perceptions of the scale or proportion of the bridge.
The top surface of the parapet upstand should be detailed with an inward fall to avoid streaking to the
outer face as a result of water runoff focused at post positions. CIRIA C543 [Ref 1.I] provides guidance
on this.
C5.4
Drainage
All water run-off should be fully managed, collected and controlled via positive, well designed and
detailed drainage system to avoid unsightly staining of visible surfaces and finishes or deterioration of
materials. Particular attention should be paid to managing leakage through movement joints.

CD 351 Revision 0
Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
C5.4.1
Drainage pipes
Where drainage pipes are exposed, they should be treated as any other design element as part of the
whole. Pipe runs should be routed to minimise their visual impact arising from their line, scale and
rhythm in relation to other elements of the structure. In addition, the effect of material and colour of the
pipes should be considered.
Where it is not possible to avoid positioning pipe runs below edge cantilevers, they may be shielded
behind parapet downstands, as long as this does not compromise the overall aesthetic of the deck itself.
C5.5
Lighting columns and other deck furniture
C5.5.1
Lighting columns
Lighting columns on bridges are best avoided on short-span structures by placing them outside the
abutments. Where lighting columns have to be accommodated along a structure then they should be
considered as an integral part of the aesthetic design. Their rhythm in relation to span lengths, height
of the lighting columns and the integration of any necessary fixing corbels within the overall detailing of
the deck can be critical visual factors.
C5.5.2
Wind shielding
When wind shielding is being considered, a range of aspects should be studied and tested, including:
1) the aerodynamic effects on the structure and traffic;
2) the effects on the appearance of the bridge;
3) the impact on the view from vehicles crossing the bridge.
C5.5.3
Effects of bridge details and surrounding landscape
Graphical methods can be used to study the combined effect of the bridge details interposed between
occupants of vehicles and the surrounding landscape, i.e. wind shields, safety fences and parapets,
but are no substitute for experiencing the real thing. This is a case where computer generated imagery
can be extremely useful, but with the same proviso.
C5.6
Light and shade
Bridges are forms seen in light and by means of light. Differences of light intensity reveal the outlines of
elements and the appearance of a structure can be modified by shaping its form such that one part
attracts light or gives shade to another.
In daylight, where reflected light is usually of low intensity, the amount of light on a surface is dictated
by its orientation and attitude relative to the sky.
Vertical surfaces will be better lit than soffits, and a sloping soffit which can be seen in elevation will
appear darker than a vertical face. This is partly why a trapezoidal box deck with fairly shallow side
slopes appears more recessive than a rectangular box of similar depth.
Where a bridge deck incorporates an edge cantilever, the most intensely lit element will be the face of
the cantilever, which by its nature casts shadows on the surfaces beneath it.
Small projections from a vertical surface reveal their presence by shadows in the same way that the
mouldings on a classical building are read. Vertical edges on projections can also reveal themselves in
this way, depending on the direction from which the highest intensity light is coming. Surface textures
such as vertical ribbing depend on this for their effect. A ribbed surface appears markedly different from
a plain surface at a distance, even though it is not possible to distinguish individual ribs.
When a bridge crosses water, the underside can be lightened by reflection from the water. Sunlight
reflected from waves or ripples can often produce a desirable visual outcome.
'Architectural' or 'feature lighting of bridges', where appropriate, should be considered in the whole and
emphasise the basic geometric form of the structure. It can be particularly effective on structures that
cross bodies of water. It should be integrated with any requirements for street lighting and ideally the

luminaires should be energy efficient, not result in light spill and be easily maintained. A mixture of
colours of light can help emphasise the various elements of the structure but care should be taken to
avoid distorting the visual balance of the structure.
C5.7
Colour and tone
Colour and tone influence our perception of aesthetics. They can be used to enhance definition, clarity
and to accentuate or subdue the visual impact of elements. Their selection should always be given
careful consideration within the predominant context of the bridge site.
For example, a light toned concrete bridge will stand out clearly against a background of dark foliage
whereas a steel bridge painted in a darker tone would be less conspicuous. Light grey makes fine
elements like balustrades less noticeable against a grey sky whereas using a dark tone for lamp posts
may make them blend within a background of dark foliage. It should however be borne in mind of
course that the sky is not always grey and many types of foliage changes with the seasons. A dark
beam, whether achieved through painting or shadow, appears further recessed against a light edge
cantilever than would a light one.
Colour schemes for painting trusses should emphasise the structural form and make a clear distinction
between structure and ancillary items such as balustrades, handrails, lighting columns, infill panels, etc.
C6
Bridge specific challenges
C6.1
New structures sited adjacent to existing structures
When a new bridge is to be placed next to an existing one, it should respect the presence of the
existing structure, the landscape and visual impact of the site. If possible, the new bridge should be
located so that the two bridges are seen as separate elements in the landscape and can be designed
as separate entities, for example, the various bridges over the River Tyne.
Ideally there should be space between the two bridges allowing sufficient separation for each structure
to be viewed from the other. This can be achieved through collaboration with the highway engineers
when developing the alignment design.
It is usually more appropriate to place an openly contemporary bridge beside an existing one. The
proportions and rhythm of the existing structure should be respected as far as is possible; this does not
mean that every pier of the older bridge should have a corresponding new one but the rhythm of the
piers should be complementary. When siting a new bridge adjacent to an existing arched structure, the
new structure should avoid cutting across the profile of the arch opening(s).
C6.2
Bridge widening
In general, it is difficult to widen an existing bridge in a way which is aesthetically acceptable, unless the
option for future widening has been specifically considered during its original design. The widening of
existing structures introduces risks and complications to both the design and construction phases.
Where site constraints mean that bridge widening is unavoidable, then it is important that the character
of the existing structure is respected and maintained. This will usually mean maintaining the original
materials and character as closely as possible but in some circumstances, a light and transparent
addition to a structure of significant mass may be successful if sensitively detailed.
When widening an existing structure that is listed or of historic significance (e.g. scheduled ancient
monument) this should be reflected in the AC allocated.
Wherever it is possible and it can be demonstrated to be reasonably cost effective, it is preferable to
develop a highway design that will accommodate a second bridge or a complete replacement. Where
the primary need is to provide additional space for walking, cycling and horse-riding users in
accordance with GG 142 [Ref 5.N] then the provision of a new pedestrian bridge can often avoid the
need for the invasive widening of an historic bridge.

CD 351 Revision 0
Appendix C. Approach to the design - bridges
C6.3
Alignment
It is important that there is close collaboration at the earliest stages of design between the highway and
bridge designers with the aim of avoiding the need to accommodate slip lanes that result in plan tapers,
excessive skew angles, high degrees of super-elevation or the need to accommodate pedestrian steps
and ramps. All of these constraints will add visual clutter that may compromise aesthetics and
complicate both the design and construction of the bridge.
C6.4
New materials
When new materials or construction methods are introduced, there is often a transition period during
which structural forms and details emerge that are appropriate aesthetically as well as technically.
The use of new materials should be implemented rationally by experienced designers, with due regard
for their individual properties, in order that they are honestly expressed within the form and detailing of
the structure and appropriate to its function.
C6.5
Bridge enclosures
Where enclosures manufactured from GRP or other materials are provided to structural elements of
bridges for durability or aesthetic purposes, they should be clearly shown as cladding elements, i.e.
non-structural elements. Retrofitting of enclosure elements should be avoided.
C6.6
Decks curved in plan
Where horizontal alignment constraints results in a bridge deck to be curved in plan, the use of straight
or faceted girders (comprising a series of short straight elements) should be avoided in preference for
curved girders, unless the radius of curvature is so great that changes of line between successive
spans are extremely small.
C6.7
Steel plate girder decks
Careful attention should be given to the detailing and visual impact of any splices, permanent bracing,
exposed services or walkways on bridge decks which feature exposed plate girders.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex sets out Highways England's specific requirements for the design and
appearance of highway structures, and the relation to the principles of good road design as set out in
the Road to Good Design [Ref 3.I] publication by Highways England.
Highway structures, and bridges in particular, are some of the largest and most visible man-made
objects. Their appearance and how they sit within the landscape is therefore an important aspect of the
design.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.I] apply to this document.
