Introduction
Introduction
Background
Integrating sustainable development into design enhances the performance of assets and
infrastructure.
The design of highway and all-purpose trunk road projects can deliver sustainable benefits for the
environment, the economy and society in general.
This document, together with the National Application Annexes, describes how sustainable
development and good road design can be applied to the design of motorway and all-purpose trunk
roads. It aligns with a range of global, European and national commitments on sustainable
development and standards of design.
Defining sustainable development
Sustainable development is a concept that seeks to ensure that economic, environmental and social
and cultural factors are central to the way development is taken forward to ensure the needs of society
are addressed in both the present day, and in the longer term.
Across the United Kingdom each country has included the concept of sustainable development in
national policy and legislation. However, all definitions share a focus on the needs of present and future
generations, and each nation recognises the importance of sustainable development in relation to the
design of infrastructure.
Definitions of sustainable development applicable to the Overseeing Organisations are presented in the
relevant National Application Annexes.
The role of design
Design has a fundamental role to play in achieving sustainable development. Decisions made by the
designer will affect the economy, the environment and society both now and in the future.
Design also plays a key role in how places are perceived, and roads and bridges are a key part of this
perception. As well as promoting sustainable development in design this document introduces the
concept of 'good road design'. Good road design aims to put people at its heart by designing an
inclusive, resilient and sustainable road network; appreciated for its usefulness but also its elegance,
reflecting in its design the beauty of the natural, built and historic environment through which it passes,
and enhancing it where possible.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Term
Definition
Circular approach
A circular approach to the use of materials is where products are kept in use
for as long as possible, and after they reach the end of their useful life they
are recovered or regenerated to retain as much value as possible.
Climate change
Long-term changes in global or regional weather patterns.
Design lifecycle
The period of time between the early stages of design and the point at
which the designed item no longer exists in its designed form.
NOTE: Design lifecycle includes the stages of option identification, option
selection, preliminary design and detailed design though to construction,
operation and maintenance and end of useful life.
End of first life
The lifecycle stage in which a material, product or asset is demounted,
deconstructed or demolished as it is no longer able to serve its intended
purpose.
NOTE: 'End of first life' implies that the material, product or asset in question
is managed so that it is diverted from 'energy from waste' and landfill.
Project
Works on the road network to which the Design Manual for Roads and
Bridges is applicable.
NOTE: The applicability of this document is defined in the scope.
Resource efficient
Minimising the use of materials, energy and other resources in order to
reduce environmental impacts and costs.
Responsibly sourced
The process of taking into the account social, environmental and economic
dimensions of materials and products prior to their use.
Whole life
The period from which the components of an object are first obtained to the
time when that object ceases to exist in its intended form.
NOTE: Usefully described as the cradle to grave period, it encompasses
elements such as extraction and processing of materials, design,
construction, ongoing management and eventual decommissioning.

2.
The importance of identifying legal, environmental, economic,
social and cultural factors in sustainable development and design
2.1
The application of this document shall be interpreted in accordance with the legal, economic,
environmental, social and cultural factors in which a design operates.
NOTE 1
Legal, environmental, economic, social and cultural factors can operate at different scales.
NOTE 2
Identification of legal context can involve review of legislation and policy that applies at national and
extra national scales as well as legislation and policy that applies solely to a specific local area.
NOTE 3
Legal, environmental, economic, social and cultural factors can influence the way in which priorities are
balanced.

4. Goals of sustainable development
4.
Goals of sustainable development
4.1
The goals of sustainable development shall be delivered throughout the design lifecycle.
4.2
The goals of sustainable development require that the design shall aspire to:
1) improve the health, safety and wellbeing of those affected by road infrastructure;
2) improve land, water and air quality;
3) support a sustainable economy;
4) represent good 'whole life' value across the design life of road infrastructure;
5) embrace innovation;
6) reduce inequalities and ensure access to all;
7) use responsibly sourced materials that minimise adverse impacts on people and their environment;
8) be resource efficient and reflect a circular approach to the use of materials;
9) minimise greenhouse gas emissions;
10) be resilient to future climate change;
11) protect, and where possible enhance, the surrounding environmental and cultural context;
12) be shaped by the opinions of communities and road users.
4.3
Where additional goals of sustainable development have been identified by the Overseeing
Organisation, these shall be delivered throughout the design lifecycle.
NOTE
Overseeing Organisation-specific requirements associated with the goals of sustainable development
can be provided in the National Application Annexes.
4.4
Projects shall identify and assess how local, legal, environmental, economic, social and cultural factors
(Section 2) affect the delivery of the goals; and how the goals can address opportunities and risks
(Section 3).
NOTE
Achieving the goals of sustainable development can involve identifying individual design solutions that
achieve multiple goals. For example, a design solution that reduces pollution to water can also
enhance local biodiversity.
4.5
A design solution shall take all reasonable steps to maximise contribution towards all goals of
sustainable development.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex sets out the Highways England principles and specific requirements on
sustainable development and design.
Sustainable development is defined in Highways England's Licence to Operate, as "encouraging
economic growth while protecting the environment and improving safety and quality of life for current
and future generations" [Ref 4.I].
Sustainable development can be applied to the design and management of roads by:
1) supporting national and local economic growth and regeneration;
2) protecting and improving the safety of road users and road workers;
3) protecting, managing and enhancing the environment;
4) improving the well-being of road users and communities affected by the network, and;
5) ensuring efficiency and value for money.
In accordance with Part 5.26 of the Highways England Licence, projects are required to demonstrate
that due regard has been given to the relevant principles and guidance on good design [Ref 4.I].
Good road design ensures the strategic road network displays quality through being safe, functional
and effective, responding positively and sensitively to the landscape character, cultural heritage and
communities through which it passes, while also supporting the goals of sustainable development.
The approach to the application of the goals of sustainable development is described separately from
the approach to good road design in this document.
Although sustainable development and good road design are treated as separate but equally import
topics, there is a strong relationship between both concepts. Indeed the UK Government state that
good quality design is an integral part of sustainable development [Ref 2.I]. However there are also
important differences in application as outlined below.
Goals of sustainable development and good road design
Goals of sustainable development
Good road design
Sustainable development goals seek to deliver
essential social, environmental and economic
priorities.
Principles of good design seek to deliver social,
environmental and economic priorities in a way
that responds in a practical and creative way to
both the function and identity of a place.
Sustainable development goals set a
specification for performance.
Principles of good design inform how to approach
and deliver a specification.
Sustainable development goals exist to sustain
human, social, financial, natural and
manufactured capital stocks.
Principles of good design exist to sustain capital
stocks but also to fulfil a wider intellectual
imperative to deliver a beautiful road.
Sustainable development is a broad agenda. It
applies to all aspects of the wider economy
including affordability and equity where
human habitats are safe, resilient and
sustainable.
There is no wider agenda to good design. Good
design applies to places or spaces that work well
for everyone, look good, last well and will adapt
to the needs of future generations.
Sustainable development goals are supported by
requirements that can be shown to have been
achieved, usually through quantitative or
objective demonstration.
Principles of good design are supported by
statements that can be judged to have informed
the design, often through qualitative and visual
demonstration.

NOTE: A road can create a geographical barrier to a village shopping
centre that previously was used by a neighbouring village, or can
reduce the feeling of tranquillity at a local tourist attraction causing a
loss of custom.
Greenhouse gases
Gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that contribute to
climate change.
High quality soils
Soils of significant quality in terms of their agricultural productivity (e.g.
best and most versatile land) or ability to deliver significant benefits
(for instance to support valuable habitats).
Natural, built and
historic environment
Terms that categorise components of the environment.
NOTE 1: Natural environment describes naturally occurring, as
opposed to human-made, aspects of our surroundings as well as
features formed by an interaction between humans and the natural
world, including landscapes and green infrastructure, biodiversity and
ecosystems, and geological diversity.
NOTE 2: The built environment is composed of human-made
surroundings, and encompasses buildings and infrastructure.
NOTE 3: The historic environment encompasses elements of both the
natural and built environment and is defined by the National Planning
Policy Framework as "all aspects of the environment resulting from the
interaction between people and places through time, including all
surviving physical remains of past human activity, whether visible,
buried or submerged, and landscaped and planted or managed flora"
[Ref 3.I].
Stakeholders
Persons affected by or with an interest in a project, including statutory
and non-statutory consultees.
Strategic Design Panel
A panel with representation from credible experts and relevant
stakeholders whose role is to independently advise Highways England
and encourage design excellence in the landscape, engineering and
built environment aspects of projects.
NOTE: The panel does not have any statutory function in its own right,
but its advice can inform and support project development and the
statutory consent process.

Appendix E/A. Principles of good road design
Appendix E/A. Principles of good road design
E/A1
Principles of good road design
1: Good road design makes roads safe and useful
Safety is fundamental to good road design; it is integral to both the usefulness of its function and the
confidence of road users and their well-being. Good design creates safe roads which support and link
to other wider imperatives, both nationally and locally, and that are fundamentally useful, meeting
users' need for mobility effectively.
2: Good road design is inclusive
Inclusive environments facilitate dignified and equal use by all. An inter-disciplinary design process
involves and places people's needs and views at its heart, nurturing well-being and creating a shared
sense of ownership of the road. All users and communities are considered carefully in order to reduce
barriers to access and participation, particularly mindful of the most vulnerable.
3: Good road design makes roads understandable
Easy to read, a good road is intuitive to use so as to be safe and efficient for all. 'Self-explaining roads'
focus on the essentials and eliminate unnecessary and confusing clutter to make them legible, while
responding to place and enhancing both environmental and economic outcomes.
4: Good road design fits in context
The aesthetic quality of a road and its design in relation to the places through which it passes, is
integral to its function and the experience of those that use it. Good road design demonstrates
sensitivity to the landscape, heritage and local community, seeking to enhance the place while being
true to structural necessities. It builds a legacy for the future.
5: Good road design is restrained
Functional, but responding positively and elegantly to the context, good road design allows for the
expression of the character and identity of the places and communities through which a road passes.
Good road design can enhance a sense of place and add to what we have inherited, particularly
through the use of appropriate materials and traditions, but does not make unnecessary superficial or
superfluous visual statements.
6: Good road design is environmentally sustainable
Making an important contribution to the conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic
environment, good road design seeks to achieve net environmental gain. It is multi-functional, resilient
and sustainable, allowing for future adaptation and technical requirements, while minimising waste and
the need for new materials.
7: Good road design is thorough
The result of robust processes that create a continual cycle of improvement, good road design starts
with an in-depth understanding of people, place and context; learning from best practice worldwide.
The design of all elements of the road environment are considered together and integrated into a
responsive design.
8: Good road design is innovative
Responding positively to change, good road design captures opportunities for betterment and develops
in tandem with emerging new technologies. Designing to a standard is not the same as achieving good
design; an innovative and resourceful approach that is mindful of context is necessary to achieve better
outcomes.
9: Good road design is collaborative
Collaboration ensures roads are useful to and accepted by the communities they serve. Collaborative
working requires a rigorous process that identifies dependencies and wider opportunities, and

Appendix E/A. Principles of good road design
facilitates effective communication and engagement from the start. Community engagement will be led
by a local sense of culture, place and value.
10: Good road design is long-lasting
With quality materials and careful detailing, good road design brings lasting value. The design process
requires sufficient time for challenges to be resolved before delivery and is adaptable to future needs
and technologies as part of the commitment to whole-life operation, management and maintenance.

(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006 includes a statutory duty that "a public authority must, in
exercising its functions, act in a way it considers best calculated to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development in Northern Ireland, except to the extent that is considers that any such action
is not reasonably practical in all the circumstances of the case" 2006 [Ref 4.I].
Sustainable development is defined as 'meeting the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs' [Ref 4.N]. The design and management of roads
can make a major contribution to sustainable development. For example, design can reduce negative
environmental, social and economic impacts of a road scheme, and can realise benefits.
While a design can be made more sustainable, design should also fundamentally be good design. The
Strategic Planning Policy Statement for Northern Ireland sets out that 'Good design can change lives,
communities and neighbourhoods for the better' and involves 'shaping how all elements of the built and
natural environment relate to each other' [Ref 4.N]. While good design can further sustainable
development, it should also encompass how the built environment functions and can create more
successful places, can attract business investment, and can encourage responsible innovation and
originality. Good design is as relevant to roads and bridges as it is to other forms of construction.
The approach to the application of the goals of sustainable development is described separately from
the approach to good road design in this document.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

Appendix NI/A. Principles of good road design
Appendix NI/A. Principles of good road design
1: Good road design makes roads safe and useful
Safety is fundamental to good road design; it is integral to both the usefulness of its function and the
confidence of road users and their well-being. Good design creates safe roads which support and link
to other wider imperatives, both nationally and locally, and that are fundamentally useful, meeting
users' need for mobility effectively.
2: Good road design is inclusive
Inclusive environments facilitate dignified and equal use by all. An inter-disciplinary design process
involves and places people's needs and views at its heart, nurturing well-being and creating a shared
sense of ownership of the road. All users and communities are considered carefully in order to reduce
barriers to access and participation, particularly mindful of the most vulnerable.
3: Good road design makes roads understandable
Easy to read, a good road is intuitive to use so as to be safe and efficient for all. 'Self-explaining roads'
focus on the essentials and eliminate unnecessary and confusing clutter to make them legible, while
responding to place and enhancing both environmental and economic outcomes.
4: Good road design fits in context
The aesthetic quality of a road and its design in relation to the places through which it passes, is
integral to its function and the experience of those that use it. Good road design demonstrates
sensitivity to the landscape, heritage and local community, seeking to enhance the place while being
true to structural necessities. It builds a legacy for the future.
5: Good road design is restrained
Functional, but responding positively and elegantly to the context, good road design allows for the
expression of the character and identity of the places and communities through which a road passes.
Good road design can enhance a sense of place and add to what we have inherited, particularly
through the use of appropriate materials and traditions, but does not make unnecessary superficial or
superfluous visual statements.
6: Good road design is environmentally sustainable
Making an important contribution to the conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic
environment, good road design seeks to achieve net environmental gain. It is multi-functional, resilient
and sustainable, allowing for future adaptation and technical requirements, while minimising waste and
the need for new materials.
7: Good road design is thorough
The result of robust processes that create a continual cycle of improvement, good road design starts
with an in-depth understanding of people, place and context; learning from best practice worldwide.
The design of all elements of the road environment are considered together and integrated into a
responsive design.
8: Good road design is innovative
Responding positively to change, good road design captures opportunities for betterment and develops
in tandem with emerging new technologies. Designing to a standard is not the same as achieving good
design; an innovative and resourceful approach that is mindful of context is necessary to achieve better
outcomes.
9: Good road design is collaborative
Collaboration ensures roads are useful to and accepted by the communities they serve. Collaborative
working requires a rigorous process that identifies dependencies and wider opportunities, and
facilitates effective communication and engagement from the start. Community engagement will be led
by a local sense of culture, place and value.

10: Good road design is long-lasting
With quality materials and careful detailing, good road design brings lasting value. The design process
requires sufficient time for challenges to be resolved before delivery and is adaptable to future needs
and technologies as part of the commitment to whole-life operation, management and maintenance.
