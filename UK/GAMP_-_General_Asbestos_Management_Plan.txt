PLANNING FOR COMPLIANCE 
 
 
1.1 
Introduction 
 
The Highways Agency has issued an Interim Advice Note (IAN 63/05) “Asbestos 
management applicable to the strategic road network.”1  The IAN advises HA Service 
Providers, Area Providers, Major Project Providers (MPD), & Major Projects Project 
Teams (MPPT), as defined in section 3 of the IAN, of the requirements of this 
General Asbestos Management Plan (GAMP) and what Providers need to achieve to 
enable the HA to meet its obligations under the Duty to Manage of Regulation 4 of the 
Control of Asbestos Regulations (CAR) 2006. This process is illustrated in section 8 
of the IAN and on page 6 of this document.  The GAMP provides an overview of 
required activity whilst the IAN gives specific instruction and a range of templates to 
assist those responsible for asbestos management procedures.   
 
1.2 
Achieving the Percentage Targets  
Owing to the vast amount of highway related infrastructure assets, the HA aims to 
implement the requirements of Regulation 4 over a period of 20 years as agreed with 
the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).   
 
The original GAMP required that Asbestos Action Plans (AAPs) be completed by 
Network Operations Directorate (NOD), now Network Delivery and Development 
Directorate (NDD), for depots, road tunnels and other buildings by March 2008. 
Coverage of the remaining network by the production of AAPs must be completed by 
March 2025. HA Service Providers, as agreed with Area Providers, are to achieve a 
minimum target of 5% per year in terms of AAP coverage for the strategic road 
network to deliver 100% coverage by March 2025. HA Service Providers in liaison 
with Area Providers are expected to produce annual management plans detailing 
their proposed breakdown of programmes on a prioritised basis as set out below to 
cover at least 5% of the total network for which they are responsible year on year.  
 
HA Service Providers are currently required to prepare AAPs for nominal 5 kilometre 
highway lengths covering all highway assets and all highway structures. The only 
exceptions are those assets that were constructed or installed during or after the year 
2000.  Assets manufactured or constructed after 2000 are unlikely to have asbestos 
as the manufacture, importation and use of any Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) 
was prohibited in November 1999 in the UK. Full details for the production and 
delivery of AAPs, along with generic templates can be found in section 8 the IAN and 
its annexes. 
 
Asbestos related surveys should be prioritised with oldest parts of the network to be 
surveyed first.  Schemes with planned maintenance needs and/or 
improvement/inspection schemes will take priority, followed by other activities, 
particularly where there is a known or suspected asbestos contaminated material 
(ACM) presence.   
 
It should be noted that the Technology National Asbestos Management Plan 
(TNAMP) provides detailed guidance specifically for the management of asbestos for 
technology assets. Separately, a National Roads Telecommunications Services

Asbestos Management Plan (NRTSAMP) is in place to guide asbestos management 
of this national asset.   
 
1.3 
Works additional to the 20 year target  
Asbestos related surveys generated by MPD under the major projects programme 
are not included in the 20 year target. These schemes are managed and delivered by 
MPD. The announcement of the Preferred Route now acts as the trigger for the 
production of a Scheme Asbestos Management Plan (SAMP) at preliminary design 
stage. Section 8 of the IAN details MPD processes. AAPs must be in place prior to 
the commencement of any works associated with any major scheme.  
 
AAPs produced by HA Service Providers will be passed to MPD at Preferred Route 
Announcement stage to assist with SAMP development. Thereafter, MPD will update 
and produce any new plans prior to construction as required for uploading to HA 
systems. Upon completion of the major project works, updated AAPs will be lodged 
with the HA Service Provider for loading onto the systems in line with the guidance in 
Section 8 of the IAN. 
 
 
1.4 
Building Assets Managed by HA Service Providers 
AAPs for winter maintenance compounds, depots, picnic sites (specifically toilet 
blocks), road tunnels and other buildings were put in place by March 2008 in 
recognition of the greater risk to exposure to an ACM for this type of asset. Where 
improvement or maintenance works are planned, a review of the available information 
should be undertaken to assess the need for further survey work i.e. a Management 
Survey or Refurbishment/Demolition Survey. Detailed guidance on surveys is found 
at section 9 of the IAN. 
 
In buildings, where the HA installs and maintains equipment through other 
organisations but does not have responsibility for the building itself, the “Duty to 
Manage” under CAR 06 rests with those with responsibility for the building. For 
example, the Duty Holder will generally be the building owner or an agent in the case 
of police control centres.  However, the HA will expect all Providers to co-operate with 
the Duty Holder on asbestos issues.  For buildings managed by the HA (for example, 
Regional Control Centres, (RCC), it will be necessary for all Providers to make initial 
contact with the HA’s Business Services (BS) Estates Team and Property Facilities 
Management (PFM) to agree how assets will be managed in terms of asbestos risks.

ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS  
 
 
Much of the highway infrastructure is over 20 years old and therefore may contain 
ACMs unless it is specifically known and recorded that subsequent maintenance and 
improvement works have included the removal of all ACMs.  An example would be 
new drainage works involving the removal of asbestos cement pipes or re-
waterproofing a bridge deck by replacing asbestos sheet composite boards. Known 
areas where ACMs exist include the following items or products, however this list is 
not exhaustive: 
 
Highway  
Structures: 
 
 
 
 
Permanent formwork to bridge decks,  
Early M1 motorway bridges. 
Filler boards in joints. 
Bearings. 
Some joint fillers/mastics. 
Gaskets between precast beams. 
Drainage to abutments/piers. 
Certain board waterproofing systems. 
Pipes, including insulation to water pipes slung under decks.  
Bitumastic coatings to some buried corrugated culverts 
 
Highways: 
Drainage pipes, communication ducts and troughs and electrical 
ducts and chambers. 
Roofing to shelters, cabins, etc. 
Panels in electrical cabinets. 
Back panels and fuse assemblies in street lighting columns, 
lanterns and other jointing cabinets/enclosures. 
 
Buildings: 
 
Likely occurrence of ACMs are referred to in numerous 
documents issued by the HSE, including roofing, drainage, 
lagging, insulation, etc. 
 
Tunnels 
Build up of dust deposits behind claddings, ceilings, etc from 
vehicles (for example, brake linings). 
Asbestos cement ventilation ducting and cladding panels. 
Rope gaskets between tunnel segments. 
Insulation, lagging and lining for fire protection to ducting and 
cables for Mechanical and Electrical equipment. 
Water tanks, sumps and debris, tiling and roofing materials. 
Associated control buildings and fan rooms, containing M & E 
services.

TYPICAL WORK PROGRAMMES 
 
 
The HA maintains and improves its assets through a wide variety of work activities 
which include, but is not restricted to: 
 
 
A programme of Major Project Schemes involving improvements and new 
build, usually to significant lengths of highway. These schemes include 
bypasses, widenings, carriageway re-alignments, junction improvements, etc 
and are broadly referred to as the National Roads Programme Major Schemes.  
 
 
A programme of schemes involving major maintenance of carriageway 
pavement or bridge works.  
 
 
A programme of Local Network Management Schemes involving predominantly 
safety related schemes to junctions or other `hot spots’ on the network. 
 
 
Programmes of traffic management and driver information schemes. 
 
 
Smaller schemes for highways and structures. 
 
 
Routine maintenance on the network. Work would include sign cleaning, 
renewing road markings, gully emptying, litter picking and clearing vegetation, 
grass cutting. 
 
 
Principal & Special Inspections and other surveys of structures. 
 
 
Emergency response works following Road Traffic Incident damage, fly tipping, 
fires and safety defects (potholes in carriageway, etc). 
 
 
Winter maintenance, including gritting and snow clearance. 
 
There are also activities related to building maintenance or improvement work in all 
depots, workshops, stores, control rooms, etc, both for planned and emergency 
works.

PROCESS CONTROL 
 
6.1 
Requirements for AAMP/SAMP and AAPs  
Details of AAMP/SAMP and AAP production are provided in section 8 of the IAN 
which asks that Area Asbestos Management Plans are prepared annually and signed 
off at Area Performance manager (APM) level.  HA Service Providers are required to 
agree with the APMs how the AAP programme will be delivered.  
 
MPD is required to submit a SAMP and AAPs at agreed stages as part of the Project 
Control Framework (PCF) delivery programme for major schemes. 
 
TNAMP is approved by the Technology Director. AAPs are annually produced, 
completed and uploaded to the TPMS database in line with the TNAMP guidance.  
  
6.2 
Audits/Feedback 
Network Delivery and Development Performance Audit Function for Contract 
Compliance (PAF) now include asbestos management and/or issues. 
 
Information collected by the HA Asbestos Management Team (HAAMT) from PAF, 
self audits carried out by HA Service Providers, specific major projects scheme 
audits, the monthly monitoring sheets and the asbestos enquiries in-box will be used 
to target future asbestos audits and improvement activity to ensure full compliance 
across the HA strategic road network and its associated assets. 
 
6.3 
Co-operation 
 
As part of the Duty to Manage under Regulation 4 of CAR 2006, if the HA has 
information regarding the presumed or confirmed presence of ACMs in assets, there 
is a requirement for the HA to co-operate with any other party with responsibilities 
associated with that asset or organisations intending to carry out works which may 
affect the asset. The HA therefore instructs its range of Providers to: 
 
 
Co-operate with all parties likely to have or require information; 
 
Review information which has been provided by manufactures and centrally held 
on TPMS, HAPMS and SMIS and share information as appropriate; 
 
Review as-constructed/maintenance records prior to compiling each AAP; 
 
Inform all parties likely to be involved in maintenance, survey and improvement 
works of the presence, or presumed presence, of ACMs; 
 
Inform all third parties with an asset in the vicinity of or running over, across, 
under or through any highway asset of the presence, or presumed presence, of 
ACMs. These will include the emergency services, utility companies, local 
authorities, Network Rail, British Waterways, navigation authorities, private bridge 
owners and other companies, such as Trafficmaster, etc.  
 
Co-operate with S278 developers and other statutory undertakers.

MONITORING AND REVIEW 
 
 
This plan will be reviewed, as a minimum annually by the HAAMT to measure the 
effectiveness of the compliance measures.   The fundamental questions will be: 
 
“Are these arrangements working?”  
 
“Are the HA’s range of Providers delivering the requirements?”  
 
“Are safe working practices in place for all assets under the control of the HA 
range of Providers?”  
 
“Is the HA taking the right steps to minimise risk of exposure to ACMs?” 
 
Information captured from this process will be fed back into this GAMP as appropriate 
by the HAAMT. The review will be based on audit findings, monthly monitoring, and 
any other sources of information which are considered appropriate, such as: PAF 
audits, MPD PCF compliance review etc.  
 
HA Service Providers are required to complete a monthly reporting proforma in liaison 
with Area Providers which outlines monthly targets and achievements to date 
including status of reports in relation to uploading AAPs onto HA databases. 
Uploading of all AAPs completed must be undertaken as soon as possible once the 
AAP is in place and in any event secured by the end of each financial year.  MPD will 
submit a monthly overview of SAMP and AAP development relating to schemes 
within the National Roads Programme.  This information will be collated by the 
HAAMT to form part of regular reporting regime to Derek Turner as Plan Owner, and 
the HA Board.

RECORDS 
 
 
Providers will be required to keep records of AAPs in PDF format on the appropriate 
databases as agreed with the HA. This will be facilitated through tagging the PDF 
document as described in section 8.5 of the IAN (Word documents are 
unacceptable).  The databases are SMIS, HAPMS and TPMS. Providers will be 
required to seek advice from HA database contacts via HA Area Performance 
Managers in order to complete the necessary uploading.  
 
 
Templates are included in the Annexes of IAN 63/05. These must be adopted by 
Providers to ensure consistent information. These will include: 
 
 
AAMP or SAMP – generic format stating how the Provider will plan for delivery of 
AAPs for their areas of responsibility.  This will include reporting requirements to 
Area Providers and/or HAAMT. The TNAMP provides templates for technology 
assets although it is recognised that in the absence of a TechMAC, technology 
assets may be covered within HA Service Provider’s plans; 
 
AAPs – generic format for each asset (structures, buildings) or group of assets 
(highway lengths); 
 
Model specification for asbestos surveys and assessments to be used to procure 
survey work from properly accredited specialist contractors employed through 
existing term contracts with Provider organisations; 
 
A range of flow charts and standard procedures which set out the principles to be 
followed by the range of Providers in their own project management systems to 
demonstrate compliance and to record actions, reviews, etc.

TRAINING 
 
 
All external Providers will be expected to nominate one or two key staff in their 
organisation to act as the named AAP Owner and to deliver the Duty Holder 
responsibility in conjunction with the HA.  External Providers will be expected to 
maintain an appropriate number of trained key staff, to allow for staff changes.  In 
addition those likely to come into contact with asbestos within the external Providers 
team will require training in accordance with Regulation 10 of CAR 06.  Historically, a 
range of training has been provided to external Providers including initial training in 
2004 and a Stakeholders meeting in 2007. No further training will be provided by the 
HA. All external Providers are now responsible for ensuring that within their 
organisation there is an appropriate number of adequately trained staff. This training 
must meet the requirements of the relevant legislation and guidance. The HAAMT will 
share training materials if requested. Requests should be sent to 
asbestosenquiries@highways.gsi.gov.uk 
 
Nominated Plan Owners will be expected to have undertaken training to cover 
asbestos awareness and the requirements of the Duty to Manage relating to asbestos
