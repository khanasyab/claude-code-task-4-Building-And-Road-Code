CD 362 Revision 1
Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document contains the requirements for the evaluation and design of a bridge enclosure to form a
protection against corrosion.
The traditional method for the protection of bridge superstructures against corrosion is a protective
coating, particularly in the case of steel. Periodic maintenance of the protective coating is necessary
which is costly and frequently results in traffic delays.
In 1980, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) put forward the concept that steel structures which
are enclosed against contaminants in the environment, could be rendered maintenance free for periods
of at least thirty years.
Trials on bridges at Iden (1979), Exceat (1981) and Queenhill (1984) confirmed the principle of
enclosure to protect steel bridges against corrosion. Hence an alternative to the traditional method of
providing long-life multi-coat systems to bridge steelwork is to provide an enclosure. The research
reports, TRL SR621 [Ref 1.I], TRL RR293 [Ref 2.I] and TRL RR83 [Ref 3.I] discuss the principle of
bridge enclosures in detail and provide further information on the concept.
An enclosure around bridge deck support steelwork provides an additional method of protecting the
steel against corrosion. An environment of low corrosivity is produced which reduces the rate of
breakdown of the protective coatings to the steelwork. A less costly initial protection system can be
used within an enclosure on a new bridge. The reduced rate of corrosion of the steel and a reduced
requirement for cosmetic repair give greater flexibility to maintenance strategies for bridges with
enclosures.
An enclosure also provides access for inspection and maintenance of the bridge.

2. Evaluation
2.
Evaluation
General
2.1
The whole life costs of the bridge with and without an enclosure shall be evaluated and compared.
2.2
The following costs of the bridge with an enclosure shall be evaluated for the comparison:
1) the cost of the enclosure itself and its maintenance;
2) any change in the cost of the bridge and associated works as a consequence of attaching the
enclosure to it;
3) the cost of permanent access provisions for inspection and maintenance;
4) the costs of using temporary access facilities during inspection and maintenance where it is
impractical to provide access facilities within an enclosure;
5) inspection and maintenance costs of the bridge;
6) road user delay costs or railway/waterway possession costs during installation of the enclosure; and,
7) road user delay costs or railway/waterway possession costs during inspection and maintenance of
the enclosure and the bridge.
2.3
The following costs of the bridge without an enclosure shall be evaluated for the comparison:
1) the cost of permanent or temporary access provisions for inspection and maintenance;
2) inspection and maintenance costs of the bridge; and,
3) road user delay costs or railway/waterway possession costs during inspection and maintenance of
the bridge.
2.3.1
The whole life costs of the bridge with and without an enclosure should be compared on the basis of
their present value evaluated for a 40-year appraisal period.
NOTE 1
The appraisal of highway structures considers a 40-year period after which the power of discounting is
such that the net present value of subsequent costs has very little effect on a life cycle cost analysis.
NOTE 2
The 40-year period used for appraisal of highway structures significantly reduces the amount of
conjecture that could be required for a 120-year appraisal period.
NOTE 3
The 40-year period used for appraisal of highway structures falls within the 25-40 year period that is
commonly used when carrying out life cycle costs appraisals of highway pavements.
2.4
Where the whole life cost of the bridge with an enclosure are similar to, or less than that of the bridge
without an enclosure, the provision of an enclosure shall be further investigated through a detailed
benefits assessment of all the factors which influence the inclusion of an enclosure.
2.5
A general assessment of the benefits of providing an enclosure shall be carried out prior to evaluating
detailed life cycle costs.
NOTE
Appendix A gives a method for carrying out a general assessment for the application of an enclosure.
Cost of enclosure
2.6
An outline design of the enclosure shall be carried out to obtain an estimate of the cost.
2.6.1
Where previous experience of an enclosure of similar size and form is available, this may be used to
assist the estimation of the cost of the enclosure being considered.
Changes in the cost of the bridge
2.7
Where an enclosure is being considered, the change in the cost of the bridge as a consequence of
attaching the enclosure shall be quantified by comparing the additional costs to the bridge with the
reduction in costs.

CD 362 Revision 1
2. Evaluation
2.7.1
Additional costs to the bridge as a consequence of attaching an enclosure should be evaluated for the
purpose of comparison from:
1) additional structural material in the bridge required to carry the additional loads (dead, superimposed
dead, live and wind loads and transferred impact loads) associated with the enclosure;
2) any strengthening works to an existing bridge to carry the additional loads associated with the
enclosure;
3) special details required for the attachment of the enclosure;
4) special measures needed to counter any adverse aerodynamic effect due to the enclosure; and,
5) cost to the bridge and approach roads associated with raising the level of the bridge soffit in order to
maintain the accepted minimum headroom clearance below the enclosure.
2.7.2
Reduction in costs to the bridge as a consequence of attaching an enclosure should be evaluated for
the purpose of comparison from:
1) a less costly paint system applicable to internal surfaces;
2) a reduction in concrete cover to the reinforcement of an enclosed concrete slab on a composite
bridge;
3) the benefits of reduced wind loads where the enclosure improves the aerodynamic characteristics of
the bridge;
4) savings associated with the avoidance of the need for special arrangement like access platforms
under the bridge; and,
5) savings in formwork and falsework costs where the enclosure can be used to provide either support
or access during construction and maintenance.
Inspection and maintenance costs
2.8
Inspection and maintenance costs shall be evaluated for the bridge, with and without an enclosure, and
compared over the whole life of the structure.
2.9
Maintenance costs for the main structural elements shall be calculated, with and without enclosure, and
compared using documents CD 355 [Ref 16.N].
2.9.1
The comparison of inspection and maintenance costs may be simplified by ignoring the elements of the
bridge which are common to both with and without enclosure.
Road user delay costs
2.10
Traffic delays due to lane closure below an overbridge and on the deck of the bridge for access
purpose, during inspection and maintenance shall be costed.
2.10.1
Traffic delays caused by lane closure due to plant or temporary access requirements should be
included in the delay costs.
2.10.2
Traffic delays due to installation of the enclosure should be included in the delay costs.
2.10.3
Road user delay costs should be evaluated using a methodology agreed with the Overseeing
Organisation and discounted using the methods described in document CD 355 [Ref 16.N].
Railway/waterway possessions
2.11
The whole-life cost of railway or waterway possessions for the construction, inspection and
maintenance of the bridge, with or without enclosure, shall be evaluated.
2.11.1
The additional costs of working during railway and waterway possessions due to enforced restrictions
should be included in the evaluation.

3. Performance criteria
3.
Performance criteria
Durability
3.1
The enclosure shall be designed as a permanent feature of the bridge structure.
3.2
The enclosure together with the components and internals shall have a design life of at least 40 years
with a life to first maintenance of at least 20 years.
3.3
The required frequency for maintenance work on the enclosure components and internals shall be the
same as, or less than, the required frequency for maintenance work on the enclosed bridge deck
support steelwork.
3.4
Items of the enclosure which are designed to require regular replacement, such as seals, shall be
designed for ease of access without disruption to traffic.
3.5
Where materials of different electrochemical potential are connected together, either within the
enclosure or in attaching the enclosure to the bridge, they shall be isolated to prevent bi metallic
corrosion.
3.6
Items of the enclosure which are particularly vulnerable to corrosion due to design detailing or their
position shall be identified to ensure that the corrosion protection is as effective as on the surrounding
structure.
NOTE 1
The enclosure can cause condensation to form on internal surfaces and collect on its floor, along with
dust and debris arising from inspection and maintenance activities.
NOTE 2
The control of corrosion can be achieved by preventing significant air movement. However, the need
for safe inspection and maintenance has to be considered.
NOTE 3
Prevention of corrosion by forced ventilation is not viable in a potentially corrosive environment.
3.7
For new steelwork within the enclosure, the minimum corrosion protective system shall be Type II,
Table 19/2B in MCHW NG [Ref 13.N], unless environmental conditions mean that a more robust
approach is required to meet the Overseeing Organisation's site specific requirements.
3.8
For existing steelwork to be incorporated within an enclosure, the protective coating shall be treated in
accordance with the maintenance specification requirements for the site agreed with the Technical
Approval Authority (TAA) on behalf of the Overseeing Organisation.
Safety
3.9
The enclosure shall be designed to provide safe access for inspection and maintenance of all parts of
the bridge it encloses.
3.10
Ventilation shall be provided during inspection and maintenance activities.
3.10.1
Safety measures should be designed where panels are temporarily removed for ventilation purposes
during inspection and maintenance operations.
3.10.2
Provision for ventilation and safe methods for dust and fume extraction during inspection and

5. Design of structural elements
5.
Design of structural elements
General
5.1
The enclosure components shall be designed using limit state principles in accordance with BS EN
1990 [Ref 8.N].
5.2
The design values for the enclosure components shall be calculated by the global and local analysis of
the bridge structure at ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state.
5.3
In addition to structural design the enclosure components shall be designed against fire, vibration,
fatigue and environmental damage.
5.4
Where the enclosure is designed for an existing bridge, the bridge shall be assessed to CS 454 [Ref
2.N] taking into account the full effects of the enclosure.
Method of analysis
5.5
The method of analysis shall be agreed with the TAA for the Overseeing Organisation as part of the CG
300 [Ref 14.N] process.
5.6
In general, global analysis shall be either by elastic methods (linear or non-linear) or plastic methods
appropriate to the limit state being considered and materials used.
5.7
Plastic methods of analysis shall only be used for materials which exhibit sufficient ductile behaviour to
cater for large strains and deflections.
Dead loads and superimposed dead loads
5.8
Nominal values for dead loads of enclosure components and superimposed dead loads of enclosure
internals shall be calculated from the densities of the materials given in BS EN 1991-1-1 [Ref 4.N].
5.8.1
Where enclosure materials are not included in BS EN 1991-1-1 [Ref 4.N], values for dead load
calculation may be obtained from the manufacturer.
Live loads
5.9
Components of the enclosure shall be designed to withstand live loading within the designated areas
for each category A, B and C.
NOTE
Explanation of enclosure live loads is given in Appendix B.
5.10
Category A areas shall be designed to withstand the following:
1) a vertically downward uniformly distributed load (UDL) of 2.5 kN/m² over a total area of 10 m² of any
shape, which can be continuous or divided to give the most adverse effect, together with a uniformly
distributed load of 0.75 kN/m² elsewhere; and,
2) in addition to the loading given in (1), a single-point load of nominal value 1.25 kN applied to an area
150 mm square in any direction on all surfaces of the enclosure, including side panels.
5.11
Category A areas shall be checked for two point-loads of nominal value 2.5 kN at 0.7-metre centres
applied to an area 150 mm square in conjunction with a uniformly distributed load of 0.75 kN/m²
elsewhere.
5.12
Any part of the live load which causes a relieving effect on the element being assessed shall be omitted.
5.13
Where heavy equipment is to be used inside the enclosure, or where the enclosure is required to
temporarily support superstructure loads such as from the construction of the deck, these additional
loads shall be applied explicitly.
5.14
Category B areas within the enclosure shall be designed to withstand the following:

======================================================================
CD 362 Revision 1
5. Design of structural elements
1) a uniformly distributed load of 1.5 kN/m² over a total area of 10 m² of any shape, which can be
continuous or divided to give the most adverse effect, together with a uniformly distributed load of
0.75 kN/m² elsewhere; and,
2) where the depth of the structure is such that additional scaffolds and ladders are required to provide
inspection access, category A loading will apply.
5.15
Category C areas shall be designed to withstand a live load uniformly distributed load of 1.0 kN on any
300- mm square area.
Wind loads
5.16
Local wind loading on the enclosure components and the overall wind loading on the bridge as
modified by the enclosure shall be evaluated using BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 6.N].
NOTE
Enclosure components can be subject to pressure peaks due to local effects from wind action and air
flow caused by traffic movement acting in combination with all other live and dead loads.
5.16.1
Specialist guidance to evaluate the air pressures on enclosure panels caused by traffic flow may be
required.
Temperature loading
5.17
The maximum and minimum effective bridge temperatures specified in BS EN 1991-1-5 [Ref 7.N] shall
be used unaltered by the presence of an enclosure.
5.17.1
The design should allow for the temperature of the enclosure panels to be 15°C greater than, or 5°C
less than, the bridge structure.
5.17.2
The enclosure support members should be taken as the same temperature of either the enclosure
panels or the bridge structure, whichever gives the more onerous conditions.
5.17.3
A detailed assessment may be carried out in order to establish a more accurate temperature range.
NOTE 1
Temperature difference between bridge and enclosure depend on such factors as the thermal inertia of
the enclosure material, colour and aspect to the sun.
NOTE 2
The temperature difference given in BS EN 1991-1-5 [Ref 7.N] is conservative for an enclosure in the
shade of a bridge.
Deflection criteria
5.18
The deflection criteria for serviceability limit state shall be as shown in Table 5.18.
Table 5.18 Deflection criteria for serviceability limit state
Loaded areas
Deflection criteria
Category A and B
The deflection under the specified single point load is less than 15 mm.
Category A and B
The deflection under the specified uniformly distributed loads does not exceed
1/100 span between support members, or 50 mm whichever is the lesser.
Category C
The deflection under the specified patch load does not obstruct the function
and operation of the bridge.
5.19
The elastic strain at the surface of the enclosure panel shall be limited to that which cannot affect the
durability of the panel materials.
Aerodynamic effect
5.20
The bridge with the enclosure shall be evaluated using BS EN 1991-1-4 [Ref 6.N] to ensure that it is
aerodynamically stable.
NOTE
The addition of an enclosure to a bridge changes its aerodynamic behaviour.

5. Design of structural elements
Partial factor (safety or serviceability)
5.21
For the design of the enclosure, the values of the partial factors shall be taken from BS EN 1990 [Ref
8.N] for dead loads, superimposed dead loads, temperature loading and wind loading.
5.22
Where the partial factors of an unconventional enclosure material are not given in BS EN 1990 [Ref
8.N], the values shall be derived from first principles and approved by the TAA.
5.22.1
The partial factors of an unconventional material should be derived from the expected variability of the
material properties, manufacturer's tolerances and dimensional tolerances.
5.22.2
The partial factors of an unconventional material should be derived with the same level of safety and
reliability to be compatible with the standard.
5.22.3
The partial factors of an unconventional material may be derived by calibration against a material of
comparable properties where the partial load factor is established and verified.
5.23
For the design of the enclosure, the values of the partial factor for live loads shall be taken as 1.0 for
serviceability limit state and 1.5 for ultimate limit state for all load combinations considered.
5.24
Load combinations as defined in BS EN 1990 [Ref 8.N] shall be used.
NOTE
The value of partial factor is not reduced when applying combinations of loading for wind and live load.
5.25
For design and assessment of the bridge and enclosure, including for evaluating the effects of the
enclosure on the bridge, the partial factors for the design of the enclosure shall be used.

A1.1
Type of bridge structure under consideration
Enclosures suit bridges with concrete decks supported on plate girders. A minimum headroom within
the enclosure of 1m will usually provide personnel access benefits for inspection and maintenance.
A1.2
Expected maintenance on new or existing bridges
Enclosures are beneficial on bridges where major disruption can take place to traffic during inspection
and maintenance. Advantage can be taken by adding enclosures to existing bridges during major
works for maintenance or upgrade. Outstanding life expectancy of an existing bridge can also influence
the effectiveness, either to extend a lifespan or conversely be uneconomic over a short remaining life.
A1.3
Accessibility for bridge inspection and maintenance
Bridges which are difficult to access for inspection and maintenance can benefit by the addition of an
enclosure more than those which are easily accessible.
Examples of difficult to access bridges may include high bridges, bridges over water or rail, and
motorway bridges, where a maintenance gantry could cause disruption to traffic flow.
A1.4
Bridge environment.
The harshness of the surrounding environment of the bridge site can influence the choice of coating
and the maintenance costs. Enclosures can be more beneficial in harsher environments.
A1.5
New or existing structures
Enclosures on new structures benefit from easier design considerations whereas an existing bridge can
require more costly designs which involve complications due to access during construction and
infringement of headroom.

Appendix B. Enclosure live loading
Appendix B. Enclosure live loading
B1
General
Three categories of design load are given for live loading within the enclosure.
B1.1
Category A
Category A loading is required wherever maintenance work is to be carried out directly from the
enclosure. This is most likely to be appropriate where the enclosure is being added to an existing
structure which is in need of major refurbishment.
In addition to personnel loading, the loading is intended to account for live load resulting from:
1) working platforms erected within the enclosure for maintenance purposes;
2) temporary ladders;
3) storage of materials and equipment necessary for the maintenance of the bridge structure;
4) concentrated loads imposed by the bases of supporting platforms and ladders; and,
5) impact loading resulting from mishandling of materials and equipment within the enclosure.
B1.2
Category B
Category B loading is the most likely category to be appropriate to a new structure where the use of the
enclosure should be restricted to inspection access and major maintenance works are not anticipated.
B1.3
Category C
Category C loading can be appropriate to large structures where it is uneconomic to provide Category
A & B loading throughout the enclosure. For such cases it is envisaged to provide main walkway areas
and use these to install additional working platforms over the particular part of the structure that is
being inspected or where maintenance activity is expected. The remainder of the enclosure need only
provide the function of a safety net with respect to personnel loading.
