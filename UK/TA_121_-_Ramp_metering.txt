Introduction
Introduction
Background
Ramp metering is a traffic management technique which manages the number of vehicles joining a
main carriageway at peak periods. The purpose of ramp metering is to prevent or delay the onset of
flow breakdown on the main carriageway and assist with its recovery.
Ramp metering systems use part-time traffic signals on the slip road which come into operation when
traffic sensors on the main carriageway indicate heavy traffic. The detectors on the main carriageway
along with queue detectors on the slip road enable the system to determine the required flows from the
slip to keep the main carriageway flowing close to critical occupancy.
A successful design of a ramp metering site relies on knowledge and understanding of motorway
communication devices and design, traffic flows, motorway traffic behaviours and ramp metering
control algorithms.
Ramp metering systems aim to control the flow of vehicles joining the motorway and all-purpose trunk
road network and are recognised as being fundamentally different to traditional traffic signalling
systems which manage vehicle conflicts and provide safety functionality.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Ramp metering appraisal
General
2.1
For recurrent congestion problems caused either by the merge or the main carriageway traffic
characteristics, the site shall be assessed to determine whether it is suitable for ramp metering using
the following approach:
1)
assess the traffic characteristics at the site; and,
2)
assess the suitability of the entry slip road geometry.
NOTE 1
Specific examples of traffic characteristics where ramp metering has been found to be particularly
effective are:
1)
merging traffic from entry slip road disrupting main carriageway traffic flow;
2)
weaving traffic as a result of closely located merge and diverge of adjacent junctions;
3)
entry slip roads fed by signalised junctions on the adjoining network causing large platoons of
motorway bound traffic;
4)
entry slip road flows overloading merge capacity;
5)
entry slip road affected by flow breakdown downstream of the junction;
6)
where queuing traffic is already present on the entry slip road during peak periods;
7)
short or sub-standard merge areas;
8)
where a bottleneck exists downstream on the main carriageway as a result of a bend or a
gradient; and,
9)
two-lane entry slip roads which have been artificially reduced to one lane in an attempt to restrict
joining traffic.
NOTE 2
There are no individual physical characteristics that rule out a site for selection completely. The main
consideration is the practicality of locating the stop line and signals safely as these affect both the
acceleration distance for vehicles merging safely and the storage capacity for queuing vehicles.
Forward visibility to the stop line and signals are required to account for the high approach speeds.
2.1.1
The assessment of the site to determine its suitability for ramp metering should include the forecast
impact on traffic characteristics and road geometry from other schemes.
NOTE 1
Ramp metering schemes for imminent implementation need not account for any adjustment in traffic
growth.
NOTE 2
Future traffic growth can be evaluated where, for example, a future development is expected in the
vicinity of the junction.
NOTE 3
Other schemes likely to have an impact on the traffic characteristics can include:
1)
changes to traffic flows;
2)
changes to geometry including road markings;
3)
changes to the number of lanes/operating regime on the motorway;
4)
changes to speed restrictions in the area; and,
5)
impact of downstream improvement schemes.
2.2
Traffic characteristics shall be determined using available traffic data from representative time periods
(such as peak hours over multiple weeks).
NOTE
A MIDAS detection system, for example, is an acceptable source to obtain traffic data that can be
collected and analysed.
2.2.1
The traffic data collection period should allow assessment over a number of days (excluding school
holidays, special events and adverse weather conditions).

2. Ramp metering appraisal
NOTE
At least a two week period for traffic data collection is typically suitable. However, a more in-depth
traffic data assessment provides a more useful understanding of the recurrent congestion issue.
Criteria for provision of ramp metering
2.3
Ramp metering shall be proposed when traffic characteristics and road geometry allow the
management of slip road flows and reduce main carriageway congestion.
2.3.1
Ramp metering should be provided when each of the following traffic characteristics are valid:
1)
annualised hours of main carriageway delay is greater than 10,000 vehicle hours delay, or
average main carriageway speeds are less than 30 mph for greater than 100 hours over an
annual period;
2)
the downstream main carriageway flows per lane are at least 1250 vehicles per hour during
congested periods;
3)
the average entry slip road flow per lane is not less than 400 vehicles per hour or greater than
1250 vehicles per hour during congested periods; and,
4)
the entry slip road flow is between 10% and 45% of downstream traffic flow on the main
carriageway during congested periods.
NOTE
Previous site assessment has demonstrated the average main carriageway delay reduction to be 13%.
2.3.2
Where entry slip road flows exceed the maximum flow, excessive slip road queuing may be prevented
by:
1)
provision of integrated traffic management to better manage slip road demand in collaboration
with adjoining road authorities (see Appendix A);
2)
remodelling the entry slip road to increase the number of lanes or storage capacity and reduce
the entry slip road flow per lane; and/or,
3)
use of local knowledge, observations and specialist expertise to assist in justifying the suitability
of the site.
NOTE
Where the maximum entry slip road flows per lane are exceeded, the installation of a standard ramp
metering system can lead to excessive queuing on the entry slip.
2.3.3
Ramp metering may still be provided when the road geometry includes:
1)
one or two lane entry slip roads;
2)
curved entry slip road;
3)
ghost island; or,
4)
lane gain from entry slip road.
NOTE
Ramp metering can struggle to perform effectively when there is:
1)
a bottleneck causing a large congestion problem, where capacity of the main carriageway is
greatly exceeded;
2)
a reduction of main carriageway capacity due to lane loss;
3)
traffic backing up from an off-slip and blocking a lane of the main carriageway;
4)
diverging tailbacks from downstream motorway intersections; or,
5)
roadwork traffic management/accident causing lane loss on the main carriageway.
Existing ramp metering sites and new main carriageway interventions
2.4
An assessment shall be conducted where a main carriageway intervention is proposed in the vicinity of
an existing ramp metering site, and only subsequently modified or removed with the approval of the
Overseeing Organisation.

2. Ramp metering appraisal
2.5
The traffic characteristics and road geometry of the current and proposed arrangement shall be
assessed as follows:
1)
main carriageway characteristics (changes to speed limits, quantity of lanes, merge type and
length);
2)
ramp metering characteristics (changes to gradient, alignment, traffic signals and proximity of
diverge);
3)
traffic characteristics (changes to the quantity and ratio of downstream main carriageway flows
and slip road flows).
NOTE
The treatment of existing ramp metering sites and new main carriageway interventions can be
assessed using the assessment tool available from the Overseeing Organisation as described in the
National Application Annexes. The assessment tool can help to determine any expected changes in
annualised hours of operation based on the traffic characteristics and the road geometry proposals.
2.6
The existing ramp metering system shall be:
1)
retained in its current state if the annualised hours of operation are expected to be at least 40;
and,
2)
modified as necessary to be compatible with the main carriageway intervention if the annualised
hours of operation are expected to be at least 60.

Appendix A. Integrated traffic management
Appendix A. Integrated traffic management
A1
Introduction
Integrated traffic management (ITM) is the practice of connecting to and sharing information between
local authority and national authority control systems to reduce congestion in the locality of a motorway
junction and improve efficiency through the coordinated operation of both systems. This typically
involves providing an interface between ramp metering systems and traditional traffic signalling
systems.
ITM requires the commitment and cooperation of both the national and local authorities, and all such
relevant organisations should be involved at all stages in the process of developing an ITM solution.
A2
Benefits of ITM
The fundamental purpose of ITM is to improve the flow of traffic at the boundary of the motorway and
local road network. The technical approach integrates the operation of ramp metering with the
operation of the adjacent traffic signal systems to better manage the combined network. Information /
data from one system is dynamically used by the other system to better manage and control the traffic
intending to join the motorway from the local road network.
When functioning correctly ITM can deliver the following benefits:
Primary benefits:
1)
overall improvement of junction performance during peak demand;
2)
net reduction in journey times for vehicles crossing the junction on the local network and vehicles
entering the motorway network from the local network;
3)
reduction in journey times for vehicles travelling along the motorway through the junction;
4)
improvement in the utilisation of the circulatory junction for local traffic;
5)
reduction in the likelihood of queue blocking at the roundabout from vehicles trying to enter the
motorway; and,
6)
improvement of ramp metering operation through minimising the effects of queue override and
optimising queue management.
Secondary benefits:
1)
improved working relationships between national and local authorities;
2)
improved maintenance agreements; and,
3)
opportunity to implement other improvements at the junction.
A3
Criteria for the selection of ITM
A3.1
Basic criteria
The criteria for assessing the suitability of a site for the application of ITM relates to the control mode of
the traffic signal systems at the junction and the resultant local traffic conditions.
A potentially suitable ITM site requires the operation of ramp metering and the partial or full
signalisation of the interchange which typically uses one of the following traffic signal control modes.
The most suitable ITM strategy will be dependent on the control mode for the junction.
1)
cableless linking facility (CLF);
2)
microprocessor optimised vehicle actuation (MOVA); or
3)
split cycle offset optimised technique (SCOOT).
If the junction is partially signalised, the performance of ITM will be improved if the partial signalisation
occurs on the arm of the junction which provides the highest flows to the motorway in either the a.m. or
p.m. peak demand period. In addition, the junction should be sufficiently congested such that it will
benefit from ITM.

TA 121 Version 0.0.2
Appendix A. Integrated traffic management
ITM should provide benefits when the flow of traffic onto the slip road is higher than the ramp metering
system or motorway merge can cope with efficiently. When assessing the suitability of a site, this
situation is most easily recognised through analysis of the queue profiles within the ramp metering
system (frequent high-flow requests from the queue management or queue override algorithm).
If slip road flows exceed 1250 veh/lane/hr for short periods of time, then ITM should also be assessed
for potential use as it is likely that these very high flows could be smoothed out by ITM.
An understanding of the following elements should support the decision as to whether a junction with
ramp metering is suitable for ITM:
1)
flow rates on the slip road and on the main carriageway;
2)
proportion of time the ramp metering system spends in queue management mode as opposed to
the main carriageway control mode;
3)
the number of times that queue override events occur in a typical peak period;
4)
the profile of the queue on the slip road. A queue which regularly fluctuates from small to large
may be supportive for ITM;
5)
the profile of the release rate from the stop line. Erratic release rates may indicate that ITM could
be adopted;
6)
typical sizes of platoons entering the slip road from the signalised gyratory;
7)
control strategy and settings of the traffic signal system feeding traffic on to the motorway; and,
8)
any evidence of traffic queuing from the motorway merge onto the local road network.
A3.2
Irregular causes of congestion
ITM should be assessed for potential use where local traffic conditions cause irregular congestion. For
example, junctions near major venues which generate localised problems causing the gyratory to 'lock'
can be suitable for ITM.
The relatively low costs of an ITM solution mean that it should be assessed for potential use to address
even the most irregular causes of congestion.
A3.3
Liaison between authorities
ITM works optimally when it provides a mutual benefit to traffic on the national and local road networks
or provides a benefit to one of the networks without having a detrimental effect on the other. As such,
ITM necessitates the commitment and involvement of both national and local authorities in the process
of developing an ITM solution.
A4
The ITM interface
There are two possible mechanisms for providing the interface between the ramp metering and traffic
signal systems as follows:
A4.1
Local link connection
A local link requires infrastructure to be installed on-street to allow communication between the two
systems. The connection may be either a wireless or cabled link. For a cabled solution, the durability of
the link, cost of construction materials and post-installation maintenance should be assessed. For a
wireless link, a radio path analysis under varying conditions should be conducted.
A4.2
Centralised instation connection
A centralised instation connection can be implemented if both the ramp metering and the traffic signal
systems operate using a centralised control (e.g., urban traffic control system) which can facilitate a
greater range of information-sharing and control functionality. These solutions would not typically
necessitate the implementation of any specialised on-street cabling or equipment.

Appendix A. Integrated traffic management
Irrespective of the interfacing option, it is necessary to ensure that information security of either system
is not comprised in any way.
It is recommended that the national and local authority stakeholders are consulted with regard to
acceptable standards for cabling or equipment installation within their jurisdiction. The termination and
testing of the cables, equipment and control logic should be carried out by engineers competent in the
disciplines of ramp metering and traffic signal systems.
If installing infrastructure on-street, a mini-pillar or chamber at the network boundary fence line can
simplify demarcation points for maintenance purposes, but also adds complexity to the design and
introduces an additional failure point.
A5
ITM control strategy
ITM control strategy can be used to vary signal timings on the signalised junction to ensure the most
efficient flow of traffic onto the motorway and local network. In its most basic form, ITM can limit the
number of vehicles trying to enter the motorway system by reducing green time on the approach road
with the highest supply of motorway-bound traffic.
The control strategy is facilitated by sharing real-time network metrics (speeds, occupancies, flows,
events etc.) between the two systems. Both systems will need to be configured to send/receive the
appropriate data and eventual control mechanisms. The configuration activities should be undertaken
by a person(s) competent in the discipline of ramp metering and traditional traffic signals systems. The
chosen control mechanism may differ depending on traffic behaviours observed on-street or the control
mode of the traffic signal systems.
The key to an efficient ITM solution is ensuring that the systems optimise the flow of traffic across both
networks. Achieving the optimal set-up is a skilled task for a team having competencies in both ramp
metering calibration and traffic signal control.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the National Highways-specific appraisal requirements for ramp
metering.
Ramp metering is a traffic management technique which manages the number of vehicles joining a
main carriageway at peak periods. The purpose of ramp metering is to prevent or delay the onset of
flow breakdown on the main carriageway and assist with its recovery.
Ramp metering systems use part-time traffic signals on the slip road which come into operation when
traffic sensors on the main carriageway indicate heavy traffic. The detectors on the mainline along with
queue detectors on the slip road enable the system to determine the required flows from the slip to
keep the mainline flowing close to critical occupancy.
A successful design of a ramp metering site relies on knowledge and understanding of motorway
communication devices and design, traffic flows, motorway traffic behaviours and ramp metering
control algorithms.
Ramp metering systems control the flow of vehicles joining the motorway and all-purpose trunk road
network and are recognised as being fundamentally different to traditional traffic signal systems which
manage vehicle conflicts and provide critical safety functionality.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.
