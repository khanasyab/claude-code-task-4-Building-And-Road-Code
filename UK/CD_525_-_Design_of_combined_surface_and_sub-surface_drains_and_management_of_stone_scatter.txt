Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out requirements and provides recommendations on the design of new combined
surface and sub-surface drains (also called French drains), and the treatment of existing combined
surface and sub-surface drains where used as a road drainage system.
The purpose of combined surface and sub-surface drains is to remove water from the road surface and
unbound sub-surface pavement layers to prevent groundwater entering the pavement foundation, as
well as contributing to attenuation and filtration of surface water runoff.
Combined surface and sub-surface drains are most effective when located at the nearside carriageway
edge or in the central reserve. However, vehicles may accidentally run over these drains and dislodge
the filter medium, resulting in stone scatter on the carriageway. This can present a hazard to road users
and vehicles and such hazard should be assessed and mitigated.
Additionally, where rounded filter medium has been used in drains, heavy vehicles can become
stranded as the filter medium is displaced by the wheels allowing the vehicle to sink.
This document provides requirements and guidance used to develop the design outputs required to
deliver the works in accordance with CC 500 [Ref 4.N].
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 8.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or other technical
specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition clause in GG
101 [Ref 8.N].

2.
Design of combined surface and sub-surface drains
Design criteria
2.1
Carrier pipes for a combined surface and sub-surface drain shall be designed in accordance with the
criteria stated in DMRB CG 501 [Ref 2.N] and the standard drainage details in CD 524 [Ref 5.N] and
CD 533 [Ref 3.N].
2.1.1
Combined surface and sub-surface drains may be used in the following locations where groundwater
levels have the potential to become high enough to interfere with the operation of a surface water
drainage system or there is limited verge width, as detailed in CG 501 [Ref 2.N]:
1)
along the edge of cuttings; and,
2)
within the central reserve.
NOTE 1
Combined surface and sub-surface drains have the capacity to facilitate the lowering of groundwater
levels.
NOTE 2
The risk of surcharge within combined surface and sub-surface drains can be reduced by increasing
the pipe diameter to the next available diameter thereby reducing the depth of flow in the pipe.
2.2
Where a geotextile is to be used within a combined surface and sub-surface drain, it shall be designed
in accordance with CD 524 [Ref 5.N].
2.3
When designing combined surface and sub-surface drains in areas where protected species are known
or suspected to exist, the nature conservation requirements stated in LD 118 [Ref 1.N] shall be
complied with.
Composite designs
2.4
Where a composite design incorporating a grassed channel is used, the grassed surface channel shall
be designed in accordance with criteria stated in CD 521 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 1
A composite design drains sub-surface flows and low surface water flows through a combined surface
and sub-surface drain, while higher surface water flows are directed to grated inlets via a grassed
channel.
NOTE 2
The provision of a composite design can form an aesthetic, economic method of flow attenuation and
surface water runoff treatment and reduce the need for additional stabilisation where stone scatter is an
issue.
NOTE 3
Grassed surface water channels are an alternative to the use of slip-formed concrete channels and
offer environmental benefits as described in CD 521 [Ref 7.N].

3.
Managing risk of stone scatter and vehicle stranding
Scenarios for use
3.1
Stone scatter from combined surface and sub-surface drains shall be mitigated at all locations.
3.2
Surface treatment or stabilisation of proposed combined surface and sub-surface drains shall be
included in the design for the following locations where the risk of stone scatter occurring is greatest:
1)
slip roads joining the main carriageway;
2)
drains located in the central reserve at the pavement edge in front of the safety barrier;
3)
drains located on a bend, the curve of which falls below the desirable minimum radii as detailed in
CD 109 [Ref 6.N];
4)
where the hard shoulder is designed to be used as a running lane;
5)
where maintenance authority has identified stone scatter as a safety or injury issue issue to road
users or maintenance staff;
6)
carriageways with no hard shoulder where the drain could be trafficked by maintenance vehicles;
and
7)
drains adjacent to lay-bys, service areas or grade separated junctions of two or more primary
routes, where drivers of goods vehicles pull off from the paved surface.
3.3
The existence and position of other locations with an increased risk of stone scatter shall be
determined as part of the design.
NOTE
The operational history of a road is a potential resource from which to establish locations of increased
risk of stone scatter.
3.4
Surface treatment or stabilisation of existing combined surface and sub-surface drains shall be
included in the design for the locations listed in this section.
Geosynthetic grids
3.5
Where a geosynthetic grid is used for surface stabilisation the design shall require it to be
manufactured from high density polyethylene or polypropylene that has an ultimate tensile strength in
each direction of 30 kNm or greater, and a minimum aperture of 40 mm.
3.5.1
Where a geosynthetic grid is used for surface stabilisation the design should have a minimum overlap
at joints in the geosynthetic grid reinforcement not to be less than 300 mm.
NOTE 1
Geosynthetic grid installed in the filter material of a combined surface and sub-surface drain locks the
aggregate particles together increasing the stability of the surface and reducing the risk of the wheels of
fully loaded heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) sinking into the drain and the vehicles becoming stranded.
NOTE 2
Geosynthetic grid installed in the filter material of a combined surface and sub-surface drain reduces
the risks of stone scatter.
NOTE 3
Performance of geosynthetic grids is not improved by turning the geosynthetic grid upwards at the drain
edges.
Bitumen-bound shredded tyres
3.6
Bitumen-bound shredded tyre material shall only be used as a treatment to improve the stability of
combined surface and sub-surface drains, thus reducing the risk of stone scatter.
NOTE 1
The instability of conventional stone-filled combined surface and sub-surface drains (experienced when
vehicles overrun) can be overcome by use of a bitumen-bound shredded tyre surface treatment.
NOTE 2
Bitumen-bound shredded tyre material is able to withstand the effects of vehicles braking or sliding on it
with little loss of tyre material.

CD 525 Version 1.1.0
3. Managing risk of stone scatter and vehicle st...
3.6.1
The design of works to treat or stabilise existing combined surface and sub-surface drains should
include the removal of any soil strips located between the drain and the carriageway edge to the same
depth as the filter material and replacement with bitumen-bound shredded tyre material.
NOTE 1
Soil strips support vegetation growth that can eventually restrict surface water flows to the drain, see
CIRIA C753 [Ref 5.I].
NOTE 2
Removal of the adjacent soil strip prevents it from breaking away from the trench side during
construction and contaminating the filter material or causing fractures to form in the paved surface.
3.6.2
Where the binder course and roadbase extends beyond the surface course at the pavement edge the
edge of the pavement should be saw-cut to roadbase depth in order to increase the thickness of
bitumen-bound shredded tyre material immediately adjacent to the pavement construction.
NOTE
A greater thickness of bitumen-bound shredded tyre material forms a stronger surfacing layer and
reduces the risk of scatter of shredded tyre material.
3.7
The shredded tyre material shall be Type B grading in CC 500 [Ref 4.N].
3.8
In accordance with CD 524 [Ref 5.N], the surface of the bitumen- bound shredded tyre material shall be
dished as a means of diverting high flows to outlet gratings.
3.8.1
The slope of any channel where bitumen-bound shredded tyre materials are used should not be
steeper than 1 in 5.
3.8.2
The design of the scheme may include a crossfall over the surface of the bitumen-bound shredded tyre
material.
NOTE
Surface water can naturally flow along the crossfall towards the rear of the drain, reducing the risk of
ponding and clogging of the bitumen-bound shredded tyre material along the edge of the pavement.
3.8.3
The bitumen-bound shredded tyre material should be confined to the drain surface at a thickness of
between 150 mm and 200 mm.
3.9
Total immersion of the bitumen-bound shredded tyre material shall be avoided in order to prevent any
risk of contamination to ground or surface waters. (See TRL RR 1422 [Ref 4.I]).
3.10
The design of bitumen-bound shredded tyre material shall prevent any piece of the surface material
entering the drainage system through any gratings or other openings.
NOTE
Bitumen-bound shredded tyre material used next to grated catchpits can result in detached pieces of
the tyre material entering the drainage system.
3.11
A design using bitumen-bound shredded tyre material shall not pose a risk to pedestrians and cyclists.
3.12
The shredded tyre material shall not have exposed steel protruding from the chips.
NOTE
Tyres from HGVs or earth-moving vehicles contain less steel than tyres from cars.
3.12.1
Tyres from either HGVs or earth-moving vehicles should be used in preference to car tyres.
NOTE 1
Tyres from either HGVs or earth-moving vehicles have thick tyre walls that better meet the grading
requirements for drainage filter media in CC 500 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE 2
Tyres from HGVs or earth-moving vehicles have better permeability characteristics than car tyres when
bonded.
NOTE 3
The risk of fire posed by the use of bitumen-bound shredded tyres is low as detailed in FRS Report
TCR195/98 [Ref 3.I].
3.13
The bitumen binder and inert inorganic filler for the bitumen-bound shredded tyre surface treatment
shall be specified in the design.
NOTE 1
Polymer-modified binders are permitted.
NOTE 2
BS EN 12591 [Ref 1.I] provides further information on the design and specification of bituminous
binders.

3.13.1
The design of the bitumen-bound shredded tyre surface treatment may include the application of
coloured emulsion to the finished surface to differentiate between the carriageway and the drain
surfaces.
3.14
If the use of bitumen-bound shredded tyres is proposed as a treatment to improve the stability of
combined surface and sub-surface drains then the specification shall be submitted to the Overseeing
Organisation for approval prior to use.
Other bitumen-bound aggregate
3.15
Where designs of new combined surface and sub-surface drains include bitumen-bound aggregate
(excluding shredded tyres) the aggregate shall be in accordance with Type B grading in CC 500 [Ref
4.N].
NOTE
Other types of aggregate potentially suitable for use bound in bitumen include, but are not limited to,
crushed concrete, glass, granular blast furnace slag and other sources of plastic and rubber products.
3.16
Where designs of new combined surface and sub-surface drains include bitumen-bound aggregate it
shall be placed only within the top 200 mm of the drain.
3.16.1
Design of surface treatment for existing combined surface and sub-surface drains may include
bitumen-bound aggregate within the top 200 mm but only following prior removal of existing material.
Other surfacing
3.17
Where a combined surface and sub-surface drain is capped with type 1 sub-base material it shall be
designed in accordance with standard details given in CD 524 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE 1
Type 1 material provides a firm surface and reduces the risk of stone scatter caused by vehicle
over-run.
NOTE 2
Type 1 sub-base material has a low permeability and is unlikely to facilitate the ingress of surface
run-off.
