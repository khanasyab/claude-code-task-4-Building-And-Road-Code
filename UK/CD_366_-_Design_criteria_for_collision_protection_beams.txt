Introduction
Introduction
Background
Collisions of heavy goods vehicles with bridge superstructures and tunnel entrances are a major
concern to bridge owners, highway authorities and other interested parties such as the haulage
industry. A working party, which was originally set up by the then Department of Transport and which is
currently known as the Bridge Strike Prevention Group (BSPG), continues to consider issues relating to
bridge strikes. A number of measures have been recommended by the BSPG ( Bridge Strikes [Ref
1.I]), with the purpose of reducing the number and severity of bridge strikes. One of the recommended
measures is the provision of collision protection beams. The purpose of this document is to provide the
requirements for the design of such beams.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] apply to this document.

2. Procedures
2.
Procedures
Decision to install CPBs
2.1
CPBs shall only be installed where it is not practical to increase the headroom by reducing the
carriageway level below and/or increasing the bridge soffit level above.
2.1.1
The decision to install a CPB should be based on:
1) whether the structure has 'substandard headroom' as defined in CD 127 [Ref 2.N];
2) any history of bridge strikes;
3) the potential for damage to the structure due to a bridge strike;
4) the safety of routes carried by the structure;
5) the potential effect of delays due to emergency closure following a bridge strike; and
6) the amount and type of traffic under the structure.
Technical approval
2.2
Technical approval for CPBs, shall be obtained in accordance with the technical approval procedure
requirements of CG 300 [Ref 11.N].
2.3
Maintenance and inspection of CPB installations shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation and
Maintaining Agent.
2.3.1
CPBs should be designed to be inspected and maintained at the same intervals as the structure to
which it is affixed.
2.4
The structure category, see CG 300 [Ref 11.N], shall be agreed with the Technical Approval Authority.
2.4.1
Most CPBs should be category 0 but this could be raised to a higher category in accordance with the
requirements in CG 300 [Ref 11.N].
Documentation
2.5
The as-built / safety file shall include:
1) guidance for future maintenance and replacement;
2) the extent and positions of possible local collision damage to the CPB which can be accepted
without requiring repair or replacement; and
3) survey records and headroom calculations.

Layout
Position
3.1
The collision protection beam (CPB) and its supports must form an integral part of the existing structure
in accordance with the Highways Act 1980 [Ref 5.N].
NOTE
A CPB on free-standing supports in advance of a bridge or tunnel can be considered as an obstruction
to the highway contrary to Section 178 of the Highways Act 1980 [Ref 5.N].
3.1.1
The CPB should be positioned so that it is considered to be a part of the protected structure.
3.1.2
The CPB should lie parallel to the protected structure rather than askew.
3.2
CPBs for the protection of existing railway bridges, over the highway, must be in accordance with
Sections 16 and 46 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act Railways Act 1845 [Ref 9.N].
3.2.1
Permissible alterations to a bridge may include the possibility of minimal widening so that it spans a
greater length of highway than before.
3.3
CPBs shall be provided across the full width of each carriageway where traffic approaches the structure.
NOTE
Two beams are normally required for each structure, one at each approach, across the full carriageway
width.
3.3.1
For segregated carriageways, CPBs may be provided across the full width of a segregated carriageway
on the side of a structure facing on-coming traffic where all of the traffic flows in the same direction.
3.3.2
CPBs should not be provided over carriageways with one-way traffic leading away from the structure.
Soffit level
3.4
The CPB soffit levels shall be chosen so that over-height vehicles strike the CPB before striking the
structure soffit.
3.5
The 'measured headroom' to the CPB shall be 10mm, plus a maximum of 10mm for construction and
self-weight deflection tolerance, less than the 'measured headroom' of the structure it is to protect.
NOTE
The CPB is positioned between 10mm and 20mm below the bridge.
3.6
The design shall include a means of adjusting the level of the CPB at time of installation to
accommodate construction tolerances and inaccuracies in predicted deflection.
3.7
The CPB soffit in the direction of traffic shall be parallel to the road surface so that high vehicles do not
become wedged under the CPB.
3.8
The 'measured headroom' to the CPB shall be the same at each end of the structure as shown in
Figure 3.8.

Headroom shall be determined by surveys before CPB installation as follows:
1) the structure soffit and the road surface is to be accurately surveyed up to 25m minimum beyond
each structure face;
2) survey points are to be at maximum 2m intervals throughout with additional lines of points at:
a) lane markings;
b) structure faces;
c) proposed CPB front faces;

3) the survey is to pick up any local high points in the carriageway or local low points or projections of
the structure soffit;
4) headroom is to be determined measured at right angles to the road cross section.
3.14
The levels which are critical to determining the 'measured headroom' for the structure shall be
re-measured at the time of CPB installation.
3.15
The 'measured headroom' shall be taken as the minimum headroom for the carriageway after
correction for sag curvature.
3.16
Where the road alignment is on a sag curve, the radius of sag curvature shall be determined from the
survey and an adjustment for sag curvature made.
3.17
The correction for sag alignment shall be based on a chord length of 25m.
3.17.1
Adjustments for sag curvature may be made in accordance with CD 127 [Ref 2.N], by graphical
methods or using the formula v = L2
8r where: v = sag curve correction, L = chord length, r = vertical sag
radius.
Horizontal clearance
3.18
The minimum horizontal clearance between a CPB and the structure it is to protect shall be 100mm
plus the calculated horizontal deflection of the CPB under impact at the ultimate limit state.
3.19
The minimum horizontal clearance between a CPB and the structure shall allow for maintenance of the
CPB and the protected structure.
3.19.1
Where the design is based on plastic section resistance, the effect of plastic deformation should be
taken into account when calculating deflection.

2) the supporting structure, which is to be designed to survive an impact on the CPB in an undamaged
state.
4.2
The CPB shall not be weakened by an impact up to the design load, so that it can remain in place and
effective after impact without requiring structural repairs.

Materials
4.12
The CPB shall be readily repairable to restore structural strength for accumulated damage resulting

With respect to Section 5 Traffic signs must conform to and be illuminated in accordance with the

NI/1.2
The collision protection beam (CPB) and its supports must form an integral part of the existing

the highway contrary to Section 178 of the Highways Act 1980 [Ref 1.N].
