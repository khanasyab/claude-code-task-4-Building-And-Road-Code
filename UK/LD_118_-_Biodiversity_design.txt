Biodiversity design
Ecological survey and its influence on design decisions, adoption of the
mitigation hierarchy and the design of mitigation and enhancement
measures.
Biodiversity resource
Ecological receptors that are present in the surrounding environment LA
108 [Ref 1.N].
Compensation
Measures taken to offset the loss of, or permanent damage to, ecological
features despite mitigation.
NOTE: Compensation addresses adverse effects which are residual, after
avoidance and mitigation have been considered CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref
2.I].
Ecosystem services
The benefits people obtain from ecosystems.
Elements
Features relevant to achieving environmental objectives in respect of
auditory amenity, biodiversity, and water quality.
Enhancement
Enhancement is improved management of a biodiversity resource or
provision of new ecological features, resulting in a net benefit to
biodiversity, which is unrelated to a negative impact or is 'over and above'
that required to mitigate/compensate for an impact LA 108 [Ref 1.N].
Environmental element
Features relevant to achieving non-landscape environmental objectives in
respect of auditory amenity, biodiversity, and water quality.
Environmental factor
1) Population and human health;
2) Biodiversity;
3) Land, soil, water, air and climate;
4) Material assets, cultural heritage, and landscape;
5) The interaction between the factors listed above LA 104 [Ref 2.N].
Environmental net gain
An approach to development that aims to leave the natural environment in
a measurably better state LA 108 [Ref 1.N].
Mitigation
Measures taken to avoid or reduce adverse impacts and effects.
Measures can include:
1) locating the development and its working areas and access routes
away from areas of high ecological interest;
2) fencing off sensitive areas during the construction period, or timing
works to avoid sensitive periods.
NOTE 1: An example of a reduction measure is a reed bed silt trap that is
designed to minimise the amount of polluted water running directly into an
ecologically important watercourse.
NOTE 2: Depending on circumstances, mitigation measures can be
located within or outside the project site CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 2.I].

Designing for biodiversity
Design measures
4.1
Biodiversity design shall incorporate measures in accordance with the hierarchical system described in
LA 104 [Ref 2.N].
4.1.1
The timing of the delivery of biodiversity design measures should be assessed for suitability in projects,
as in some cases design measures need to be in place before an adverse impact occurs.
Avoidance and prevention measures
4.2
Biodiversity design shall address adverse impacts on biodiversity resources as far as possible through
the use of a hierarchical system for the identification and assessment of impacts in accordance with
requirements in LA 104 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
Examples of measures to avoid or prevent impacts include consideration of alternative route corridors,
or alternative design options, to avoid sensitive sites.
4.3
Project programmes shall be informed by seasonal survey constraints in order to avoid or prevent
adverse impacts.
4.3.1
Project design should avoid and prevent indirect effects on biodiversity resources including changes to
the systems on which sites, habitats and the species depend.
Reduction
4.4
Where the use of a hierarchical system for the identification and assessment of impacts in accordance
with requirements in LA 104 [Ref 2.N] does not resolve all identified adverse impacts, mitigation
measures shall be identified.
4.4.1
Mitigation measures should be specific and proportionate to the nature, magnitude and duration of the
impact.
4.5
Only mitigation measures that are effective and proven shall be included in project design.
4.6
Where innovative or unproven mitigation measures are proposed, evidence of the consideration of
uncertainty in accordance with the requirements of LA 104 [Ref 2.N] shall be submitted to the
Overseeing Organisation.
Compensation measures
4.7
Biodiversity compensation measures shall provide replacement ecological resources or functions that
are of a similar type and an equivalent or higher value than those being impacted.
NOTE 1
There is inherent uncertainty in the success of biodiversity compensation measures, particularly in
cases which require ecological restoration, habitat creation, or translocation of species or habitats,
therefore designing for higher replacement ratios can improve confidence in outcomes.
NOTE 2
Compensation measures requirements for European Sites are set out in LA 115 [Ref 4.I].
4.8
Where the use of a hierarchical system for the identification and assessment of impacts in accordance
with requirements in LA 104 [Ref 2.N] does not resolve all identified residual impacts, compensation
measures shall be developed.
4.8.1
Biodiversity compensation measures should be specific and proportionate to the nature, magnitude,
duration and location of the impact.
4.8.2
Biodiversity compensation measures should prioritise, where practical, delivery on or near to the site of
impact.
NOTE
The delivery of compensation measures in close proximity to the impact site can support the reduction
of the difficulty of delivery and associated risks.

The existing baseline ecological value of any potential enhancement areas should be assessed in
accordance with LA 108 [Ref 1.N] when developing the design of biodiversity elements.
4.9.3
Biodiversity elements should include changes to the management of existing resources to provide
biodiversity benefits, or the creation of new resources.
NOTE 1
Biodiversity elements can be delivered alongside mitigation measures for other environmental effects.
NOTE 2
Biodiversity elements can be designed to deliver biodiversity objectives that are specified in relevant
policy documents.
Specific approaches to design
4.10
Biodiversity design shall be undertaken in line with current published technical guidance and standards.
4.10.1
Any variation from current published technical guidance and standards should be justified and agreed
with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Sources of design mitigation technical guidance and standards can be found in Table 3.2.4N.

Appendix A. Species specific approaches to surveying
A1
Badger surveys
A1.1
Survey area
A corridor of approximately 500m (i.e. 250m either side of the centre-line of the road) is usually
sufficient, widened to 1km as necessary to locate nearby setts or other features of importance. The
status and activity of each sett within the corridor should be assessed along with the most well-used
badger paths which cross the route line.
It is occasionally necessary to widen the survey area considerably in order to properly determine the
status of setts (by locating other neighbouring setts), where required by local conditions/circumstances.
This is usually undertaken in a later design stage of the project life-cycle, when it has been confirmed
that the sett in question would be affected by construction.
Badger setts that would be affected during construction, should be re-surveyed immediately prior to
construction to update the original survey and adjust the proposed mitigation as necessary.
A1.2
Data publishing
Specialist badger reports produced as part of the environmental assessment should not be made
publicly available in a form that would allow sett locations to be identified. Requests for such
information should be managed in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
A2
Reptile surveys
A2.1
Use of artificial refuges
An appropriate weight of heat-absorptive material should be used as artificial refuges beside
operational roads. The weight and placement of artificial refuges should be sufficient to prevent
displacement by the draught of passing vehicles. Other lighter and/or stiffer materials (corrugated metal
for example) may pose a hazard to road users when placed adjacent to the carriageway.
For reptile surveys away from the live carriageway, where artificial refuges will not represent a hazard
to passing traffic or members of the public, the use of corrugated metal and heavy gauge rubber is
recommended for at least some of the refuges.
A2.2
Population estimates
Estimating population sizes or densities accurately requires sampling a relatively large proportion of a
resident population. There are welfare considerations associated with repeated handling of reptiles and
other intrusive techniques. Survey techniques that require handling should be restricted to those
situations where, on the basis of the magnitude of the predicted impacts and the importance of the
population, consultation with the relevant stakeholders confirms the requirement for population data.
