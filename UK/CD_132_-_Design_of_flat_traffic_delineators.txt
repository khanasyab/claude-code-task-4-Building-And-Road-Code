General requirements for flat traffic delineators
Design and use of flat traffic delineators
2.1
FTDs shall be designed in accordance with BS 8442 [Ref 4.N] and this document.
NOTE
Diagram 7102, which can be found in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 ( UKSI
2016/362 [Ref 5.N]) and the Traffic Signs Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997 ( NISR 1997/386
(TSRNI) [Ref 7.N]), provides an illustrative example of an FTD.
2.2
An FTD shall comprise a flat blade fixed to a base.
2.2.1
FTDs may be used as an alternative to cones on dual carriageway roads.
2.2.2
FTDs should only be used where they can be placed with the white retroreflective surface facing the
approaching traffic.
2.2.3
FTDs should not be used within 50 m of at-grade junctions on all-purpose, dual carriageway trunk
roads.
2.3
The blades of an FTD shall be insertable and removable with commonly available tools.
2.4
The text, "DUAL CARRIAGEWAY AND MOTORWAY USE ONLY," shall be applied to the lowermost,
red portion of the FTD blade.
Dimensions of flat traffic delineators
2.5
The dimensions of a FTD must be in accordance with Diagram 7102 of the Traffic Signs Regulations
and General Directions 2016 ( UKSI 2016/362 [Ref 5.N]) or the Traffic Signs Regulations (Northern
Ireland) 1997 ( NISR 1997/386 (TSRNI) [Ref 7.N]).
NOTE
Table A1.3 of TSM Chapter 8 [Ref 6.N] provides details on how to determine the appropriate FTD
height.
Colour of flat traffic delineators
2.6
FTD blades must be coloured red and white in accordance with Diagram 7102 of the Traffic Signs
Regulations and General Directions 2016 ( UKSI 2016/362 [Ref 5.N]) or the Traffic Signs Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 1997 ( NISR 1997/386 (TSRNI) [Ref 7.N]).
2.7
The white portion of an FTD blade shall be retroreflective.
2.8
The coefficient of retroreflection class for the white retroreflective portion of an FTD blade shall be
equivalent to the cone classes outlined in Section 6 of CD 130 [Ref 2.N].
2.9
The red and white portions of the FTD blade shall be designed in accordance with the chromaticity
co-ordinates and luminance factor in BS EN 13422 [Ref 8.N].
2.10
FTD bases shall be coloured red, black, grey or brown.
Retroreflective line for flat traffic delineators
2.11
Where white retroreflective material is to be added to FTD bases, it shall be in accordance with the
chromaticity coordinates and luminance factor in BS EN 13422 [Ref 8.N].
2.12
The coefficient of retroreflection class for the white retroreflective material on a FTD base shall be
equivalent to the cone classes outlined in Section 6 of CD 130 [Ref 2.N].
2.12.1
White retroreflective material may be used to add a line to FTD bases where it covers the edge of
carriageway road marking.
2.12.2
The white retroreflective line may be added to FTD bases provided:

2. General requirements for flat traffic delinea...
1)
the edge of the base where the white line is to be attached comprises a sloping surface which is
at an angle to the road surface of no more than 60° and is of such dimensions either to fully
accommodate the 100 mm wide white line or, where the angle between the road surface and the
sloping surface exceeds 30°, to accommodate at least 80 mm of the width of the white line, the
excess (maximum 20 mm) being returned onto the top surface of the base;
2)
the base material allows for proper adhesion or attachment of the white reflective line to prevent it
becoming detached during normal use; and
3)
the coverage of white reflective material is maintained at more than 70% of the area treated.
Ballasting flat traffic delineators
2.13
Where an FTD is designed to be ballasted, the minimum mass of the FTD, including any ballast
recommended by the manufacturer, shall be in accordance with the mass of a traffic cone as defined in
BS EN 13422 [Ref 8.N].

Testing requirements for flat traffic delineators
3.1
FTDs shall be supplied with test reports for physical performance in accordance with BS 8442 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
The frequency for testing FTDs is provided in Section 5 of CC 130 [Ref 1.N].
3.2
FTDs shall only be used where testing in accordance with BS 8442 [Ref 4.N] and the associated test
reports demonstrate that the FTDs satisfy the acceptance criteria in Table 3.2.
Table 3.2 Acceptance criteria for FTD testing
Item
Test
Acceptance criteria
1.
Impact resistance
The coefficient of luminous intensity, R, after testing is not less than 80%
of the value prior to the testing.
2.
No part of the FTD, with the exception of the white retroreflective
material, cracked, fractured or split during testing.
3.
The residual deflection of the top of the blade in any horizontal direction,
measured 30 seconds to 60 seconds after completion of the tests, was
not more than 12.5% of the height of the FTD.
4.
Bending test
The FTD bases remained in contact with the reference surface.
5.
No part of the FTD, with the exception of the white retroreflective
material, cracked, fractured or split during testing.
6.
Fatigue
The FTD bases remained in contact with the reference surface.
