Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document covers the management of cultural heritage assets, the assessment of priorities, the
preparation of management proposals, and monitoring/review to support the Overseeing Organisation's
duties and obligations to preserve and enhance cultural heritage resources.
The UK is committed to the care of the cultural heritage resource as a signatory of the following
conventions:
1) UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972
World Heritage Convention) [Ref 1.N];
2) European Cultural Convention (1954) [Ref 6.N];
3) Convention on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe (1985) [Ref 4.N];
4) European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (1992) [Ref 5.N];
5) European Landscape Convention (2000) [Ref 7.N];
6) UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001) [Ref 8.N]; and
7) Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (2005) [Ref
2.N].
Cultural heritage resources potentially affected by roads include buried remains (e.g. archaeological
deposits), historic structures (e.g. milestones, sign-posts, buildings and bridges), and historic
landscapes (e.g. field systems, historic parks and gardens, relic landscapes), both within the footprint
of the road and the surrounding area.
The preservation and enhancement of cultural heritage assets is integral to the maintenance and
management of the highway estate.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.

E/1. Cultural heritage asset management plans
E/1.
Cultural heritage asset management plans
Principles and purpose
E/1.1
A CHAMP shall be prepared by the service provider for all cultural heritage assets on the highway
estate.
E/1.2
The actions within the CHAMP shall be undertaken for the protection and enhancement of cultural
heritage assets as part of the wider management of the highway estate.
E/1.3
Cultural heritage assets identified within the CHAMP shall be recorded within the Environmental
Information System (EnvIS).
E/1.4
A CHAMP shall be prepared to:
1) inform the reporting of targets for the preservation, management and enhancement of cultural
heritage assets;
2) identify opportunities for partnerships with neighbouring landowners and relevant organisations;
3) identify measures to mitigate unavoidable negative impacts on cultural heritage assets, for example,
verge maintenance works or air pollution.
Methodology
Study area
E/1.5
The study area shall consist of the highway estate, plus a 50m buffer to include adjacent cultural
heritage resource.
E/1.5.1
The CHAMP study area may be either route or area based.
Baseline conditions
E/1.6
The following baseline data shall be collected from Highways England's asset data management
system, the historic environment record and the National Heritage list for England:
1) location and extent of the cultural heritage asset;
2) a brief description including its setting;
3) a summary of its heritage value and a brief history of the asset.
E/1.6.1
Judgements of value should be based on the significance criteria in LA 106 [Ref 2.N].
NOTE
Further guidance on setting is contained in 'The Setting of Heritage Assets' [Ref 3.I].
E/1.7
Baseline descriptions in Highways England's asset data management system shall be used, to ensure
consistent use of terminology.
E/1.8
Detailed reports prepared to inform the CHAMP shall be retained and placed in the appendices of the
plan.
E/1.9
When reporting, the condition of each cultural heritage asset shall be expressed as red, amber or green
in accordance with the Asset Data Management Manual ADMM [Ref 1.N].
Condition of cultural heritage asset
E/1.10
An assessment of the condition and any impacts on the cultural heritage asset shall be made to
determine the asset's vulnerability.
E/1.10.1
The assessment of an asset's condition should include:
1) completeness;
2) the state of its setting;
3) the survival of its features of historic interest; and

E/1. Cultural heritage asset management plans
4) comparison with others of its type.
E/1.11
The assessment of the vulnerability of a cultural heritage asset shall be based on:
1) its rate of change (e.g. is it deteriorating rapidly or is it relatively stable?); and
2) the predicted changes that can be caused by future management regimes or by proposed projects.
E/1.11.1
The impacts of past events and prevailing conditions on a cultural heritage asset should be observed
through field survey.
E/1.11.2
Regular contact should be established with those responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
highways estate to determine potential future impacts on cultural heritage assets.
NOTE
An example of a future impact is the erection of a gantry.
E/1.12
Following the assessment of condition, vulnerability shall be defined as:
1) robust;
2) adequate; or
3) fragile.
E/1.12.1
The condition rating within EnvIS should be used with the predicted future impact to achieve a priority
for management action.
NOTE 1
Where assets have a 'green' condition reported within ADMM and the predicted future impact is low,
vulnerability is assessed as robust.
NOTE 2
Where assets have 'red' condition reported within ADMM and the predicted future impact is high,
vulnerability is assessed as fragile.
E/1.13
The value and vulnerability assessments shall be combined to establish the priority for management
action, as set out in Table E/1.13.

Potential causes of change to cultural heritage assets, the impact of the change and any remedial
action shall be identified.
E/1.14.1
Table E1.14.1N1 provides a list of common causes of change, their impacts and accepted remedial
actions, however, the list is not exhaustive, and all issues should be assessed on a case by case basis.
NOTE 1
An underlying principle for the management of the cultural heritage resource is to minimise the amount
of disturbance.
