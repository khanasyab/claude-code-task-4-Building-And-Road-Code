Incremental change to

updates
New version of document published solely to resolve revision number issue.
This was caused when an amendment was made to the Scotland National Application Annex document in May
2020 to remove duplicate wording without a new revision number being issued. This meant there were incorrectly
two revision 2 documents available on the website with different publication dates of March 2020 and May 2020.
No changes have been made to the core document and England National Application Annex since they were last
updated in March 2020. No changes have been made to the Wales and Northern Ireland National Application
Annexes since their original publication in November 2019. The Scotland National Application Annex is being
re-published with a new revision number 1.0.1 to reflect the change made in May 2020 and no further changes
have been made since this time.

General design principles
2.1
Walking, cycling and horse-riding routes shall be free from unnecessary diversions, frequent obstacles
and fragmented facilities.
2.1.1
Where absolute and desirable minimum values are provided within this document, the desirable
minimum value should be used unless an existing physical constraint prevents the use of this.
2.1.2
Walking, cycling and horse-riding routes should be designed to achieve the best balance of the five
core design principles in Table 2.1.2.
Table 2.1.2 Core design principles for walking, cycling and horse-riding
Coherence
Link trip origins and destinations, including public transport access points. Routes
are continuous and easy to navigate.
Directness
Serve all the main destinations and seek to offer an advantage in terms of
distance and journey time.
Comfort
Infrastructure meets design standards and caters for all types of user, including
children and disabled persons.
Attractiveness
Aesthetics, noise reduction and integration with surrounding areas are important.
Safety
Dedicated networks and facilities not only improve pedestrian, cyclist and
equestrian safety, but also their feeling of how safe the environment is. This
includes access to adjacent areas, sightlines, fencing, lighting, landscaping and
surveillance. It also includes avoiding opportunities for assailants to conceal
themselves.

CD 143 Version 2.0.1
5. Horse-riding routes
5.11
For visibility splay "y" distances for equestrians at junctions and crossing points, CD 195 [Ref 2.N] shall
be used.
Gradient
5.12
The maximum longitudinal gradient on a horse-riding route, where cycling is prohibited, shall be 20%.
NOTE
Where cycling is permitted on a horse-riding route the maximum gradient is defined by the cycling
requirements.
5.12.1
Longitudinal gradients on horse-riding routes should be kept to a minimum.
5.12.2
Steps may be used to reduce the overall longitudinal gradient on horse-riding routes.
5.13
Where steps are used on horse-riding routes, these shall be 0.15 metres in height and 2.8 metres in
length.
5.14
Where steps are used on horse-riding routes, these shall consist of a maximum longitudinal gradient of
10% on each step.
Crossfall
5.15
On horse-riding routes, the crossfall values for footways in Inclusive Mobility [Ref 3.N] shall be used.
5.15.1
Adverse crossfall on bends should be avoided on horse-riding routes.
Cross-sections
5.16
Surfaced widths for horse-riding routes shall be in accordance with Table 5.16.
Table 5.16 Surfaced widths for horse-riding routes
Minimum 2-way width (where horses are expected to pass each other)
3.0 metres
Minimum single file width
2.0 metres
5.16.1
Horse-riding routes where single file use is unavoidable should be signed accordingly.
5.16.2
Sudden changes in widths on horse-riding routes should be avoided except at gates.
5.16.3
Where changes in widths are necessary on horse-riding routes, tapers of no sharper than 1:7 should be
used.
5.16.4
Locations to turn a horse around on a horse-riding route should be available at intervals of no more
than 1km.
5.16.5
The surfaced width of the horse-riding route at horse turning points should be a minimum of 3.0 metres.
5.16.6
On horse-riding routes or horse-riding routes shared with pedestrians and/or cyclists, the separation
from the carriageway should be a minimum of 1.8 metres.
NOTE
Where a hard strip is provided on the carriageway, it can be considered as part of the separation
distance for horse-riding routes.
5.16.7
Where visual screening is provided between the horse-riding route and the carriageway, gaps should
be avoided as the sight and sound of vehicles can unnerve horses.
Access controls
5.17
Where bridle gates are used on horse-riding routes, a minimum width of 1.525 metres between posts
shall be provided.
5.17.1
There should be a surfaced width of 3.0 metres on either side of a bridle gate for a distance of 5.0
metres.

CD 143 Version 2.0.1
5. Horse-riding routes
NOTE
A surfaced width of 3.0 metres either side of a bridle gate allows an equestrian to turn 90 degrees after
passing through the gate to be able to close it from horseback.
5.17.2
Fencing for 1.5 metres each side of a bridle gate should be free of barbed wire and overhanging trees.
Headroom on horse-riding routes
5.18
Except for momentary obstructions, headroom for horse-riding routes where horses are ridden shall be
a minimum of 3.4 metres.
5.19
Where momentary obstructions are present on a horse-riding route, the minimum headroom shall be
2.8 metres at the momentary obstruction.
NOTE 1
Momentary obstructions can include overhanging trees and signs.
NOTE 2
For headroom requirements at subways see equestrian crossings.
5.19.1
If horses are led rather than ridden, 2.8 metres headroom on horse-riding routes may be used over
longer distances than for momentary obstructions, such as below bridges.
5.19.2
Where horses are to be led on horse-riding routes, mounting blocks should be provided on either side
of the area where horses are to be led together with signs advising equestrians to dismount.
Equestrian crossings
5.20
Where there is a parking demand, physical measures to prevent parking at equestrian crossings shall
be included in the scheme design.
5.20.1
Protective posts may be provided to prevent parking at horse-riding routes that are crossed by
vehicular accesses to the carriageway.
5.21
Where overbridges are proposed for equestrian use, CD 353 [Ref 1.N] shall be used on the approach
to the bridge for cross-sections, fences and infill panels.
NOTE
Underpasses are preferred to overbridges by equestrians for grade-separated crossings.
5.22
Stand-alone signal controlled crossings for equestrians shall not be provided where the 85th percentile
speed exceeds 50mph.
NOTE
Information on calculating 85th percentile speeds is available in CA 185 [Ref 7.N].
5.23
At-grade equestrian crossings shall not be provided on:
1) roads with a 120 kph design speed;
2) wide single carriageways;
3) wide single 2+1 roads; and
4) single carriageways with climbing lanes.
5.23.1
Signal controlled equestrian crossings should not be combined with a pedestrian and/or cyclist crossing
in order to avoid potential conflict.
NOTE 1
Signal controlled equestrian crossings can be installed parallel to pedestrian and/or cyclist crossings.
NOTE 2
A drawing of a typical signal controlled equestrian crossing parallel to a pedestrian and/or cyclist
crossing is shown in Figure 5.23.1N2.

pedestrian and/or cyclist crossing
5.23.2
At equestrian crossing points, a 10.0 metres wide band of high friction surfacing should be provided
across the carriageway to prevent horses from slipping.
5.23.3
Where high friction surfacing is used, this should be of the same colour as the carriageway.
5.24
Where at-grade equestrian crossings are provided, a fenced, grassed holding area of 10.0 metres wide
by 5.0 metres long shall be provided in the verge.
NOTE 1
When crossing the carriageway at-grade, a holding area can be beneficial as a horse can be startled or
become impatient waiting for long periods.
NOTE 2
Staggered approaches to at-grade crossings can be beneficial to prevent equestrians from moving
straight across the road without checking for oncoming traffic.
NOTE 3
A drawing of a typical equestrian at-grade crossing holding area is shown in Figure 5.24N3.

Widths of unsegregated shared use routes shall be a minimum of:
1) 3.0 metres where there are 200 users an hour or more; or
2) 2.0 metres where there are less than 200 users per hour.
E/3.5.1
On segregated and unsegregated shared use routes for pedestrians and cyclists, the separation from
the carriageway should be a minimum of:
1) 1.5 metres on roads with a speed limit greater than 40mph; or
2) 0.5 metres on roads with speed limits of 40mph or less.
NOTE
Where a hard strip is provided on the carriageway, it can be considered as part of the separation
distance for shared use routes.
E/3.5.2
Where segregated and unsegregated shared use routes includes a horse-riding route, the separation
from the carriageway should be at least 1.8 metres.

NOTE 1
Wide subways are where a subway forms an extension to a footway system carrying a large number of
pedestrians.
NOTE 2
Normal subways are suitable for the majority of situations.
NOTE 3
Narrow subways are for small numbers of pedestrians where normal subways cannot be justified on
cost grounds.
E/4.9.1
The longitudinal gradient of the subway should be no less than 0.7% to allow for drainage.
E/4.9.2
In subways forward visibility of 4.0 metres or more should be provided at corners and changes of
direction for pedestrians.
NOTE
For the purposes of determining visibility provision at corners and changes of direction in subways,
pedestrians can be assumed to be 0.4 metres away from an adjacent vertical wall.
E/4.9.3
In subways the forward visibility envelope should extend from a height of 1.5 metres (representative of
an adult) to 0.6 metres (for a child).
NOTE
Inside corners rounded off to a radius of 4.6 metres meet the forward visibility criteria in subways.
E/4.9.4
Access ramps or stairs should be the same width as the subway.
E/4.9.5
On stairs and ramps at subways, handrails should be provided:
1) on both sides of the stairs and ramps, at a distance of 45 mm from the wall;
2) with a central handrail where the width of stairs or ramps exceeds 3.0 metres;
3) at a height of 1.0 metre above the level surface;
4) at a height of 0.9 metres above a ramp;
5) at a height of 0.85 metres above the nose of a step;
6) with a handrail cross section of between 45 mm and 55 mm in diameter.
E/4.9.6
On stairs and ramps at subways, landings should be provided:
1) at changes in direction and changes in gradient;
2) at intervals where the total rise is no greater than 3.5 metres (even on straight ramps);
3) which are the same width as the ramp or stairs;
4) a minimum of 2.0 metres long, measured along the centre line of the landing;
5) that are horizontal;
6) that are adequately drained.
E/4.9.7
Pedestrian ramps and stairs should both be provided for access to pedestrian subways.
E/4.9.8
Ramps should have a maximum gradient of 5%, or a maximum gradient of 10% for short distances only
where significant constraints exist.
E/4.10
Table E/4.10a and Table E/4.10b shall be used for dimensions for straight and helical stairs.

The following criteria should be applied to straight and helical stairs:
1) headroom between any ceiling and stair measured vertically to be no less than the height of the
subway;
2) stair flights to comprise no more than 20 steps between landings, or 9 steps where dedicated
facilities other than steps are not provided;
3) landings to be the same width as the stair;
4) landing depth to be 1.8 metres deep;
5) not be more than 3 successive flights of stairs without a change of direction of 30 degrees or more at
a landing;
6) all landings to be horizontal;
7) all landings to be adequately drained;
8) stair pitch to be uniform with steps of equal rise;
9) nosings on the stairs to be rounded to a 6 mm radius without overhang;
10) nosings on the stairs to be colour contrasted from the rest of the step.
E/4.10.2
For helical stairs central structural columns should be slender to avoid places of concealment.
