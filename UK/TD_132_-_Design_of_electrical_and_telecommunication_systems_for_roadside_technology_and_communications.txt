NOTE
Advice on cabinet requirements can be obtained from the TSP such that the enclosure, access and
maintenance needs of the third-party provider and the TSP are both satisfactorily accommodated.
4.12
Supporting infrastructure shall be provided to facilitate the installation of the TSP's local cabling
between the cabinet in the boundary fence and the communications cabinet that contains the TSP's
SDP.
NOTE
The removal and relocation of transmission cabinets can be complex and expensive. They can only be
performed in a number of stages that require consultation with the Overseeing Organisation or TSP
because services can be affected that wholly rely on the transmission cabinet or transmission station.

E/1.1
The use of direct-buried armoured cables for roadside technology and communications shall be
approved by the asset owner of the cable.
E/1.2
The design shall state the installation requirements for armoured cables for roadside technology and
communications.
E/1.2.1
Sacrificial ducting may be used to facilitate the installation of armoured cables for roadside technology
and communications.
E/1.2.2
Armoured cables for roadside technology and communications should allow a minimum of 3 m length

E/1.3
The design shall state the requirement for terminating the armoured cable for roadside technology and
communications into the equipment cabinets.
Existing armoured cable installations for roadside technology and communications not
maintained by TSP
E/1.4

the TSP shall be replaced with armoured cables, when in comparison it is not cost-effective to replace
them with a non-armoured cable in a ducted system.
E/1.4.1
The selection of cable system for roadside technology and communications should take the existing
infrastructure and whole-life costs into account.
E/1.4.2
Direct burial of armoured cables for roadside technology and communications is no longer standard
practice for the installation of cables; however, it may be permitted in exceptional circumstances such
as replacing a length of existing direct-buried armoured cable.
NOTE
A consistent type of cabling avoids piecemeal sections of armoured and non-armoured cable.
Trenches for direct-buried armoured cables for roadside technology and communications
E/1.5
The depth of excavation for directly buried cables for roadside technology and communications laid
under verges, footways or open ground shall have a minimum cover of 500 mm and 750 mm under
carriageways or 300 mm below formation, whichever is greater in depth.
E/1.6
When cables for roadside technology and communications are laid in a cable trench on an
embankment or a cutting, the depth of fill and materials used to backfill the trench shall be such that the
embankment or cutting does not collapse or subside.
E/1.6.1
Backfill of a cable trench for roadside technology and communications should be as shown in TC 131
[Ref 2.N] unless the site conditions require an alternative construction.

TD 132 - WNAA Version 1.0.0
W/1. Cables for roadside technology and communicat...
W/1.
Cables for roadside technology and communications
Armoured cables for roadside technology and communications
W/1.1
The use of direct buried armoured cables for roadside technology and communications shall be
approved by the asset owner of the cable.
W/1.2
The design shall state the installation requirements for armoured cables for roadside technology and
communications.
W/1.2.1
Sacrificial ducting may be used to facilitate the installation of armoured cables for roadside technology
and communications.
W/1.2.2
Armoured cables for roadside technology and communications should allow a minimum of 3 m length
for buried loops adjacent to each cabinet, taking into account the minimum bend radius of the cable.
W/1.3
The design shall state the requirement for terminating the armoured cable for roadside technology and
communications into the equipment cabinets.
Existing armoured cable installations for roadside technology and communications not
maintained by TSP
W/1.4
Existing armoured cable installations for roadside technology and communications not maintained by
the TSP shall be replaced with armoured cables, when in comparison it is not cost effective to replace
them with a non-armoured cable in a ducted system.
W/1.4.1
The selection of cable system for roadside technology and communications should take the existing
infrastructure and whole-life costs into account.
W/1.4.2
Direct burial of armoured cables for roadside technology and communications is no longer standard
practice for the installation of cables; however, it may be permitted in exceptional circumstances such
as replacing a length of existing direct buried armoured cable.
NOTE
A consistent type of cabling avoids piecemeal sections of armoured and non-armoured cable.
Trenches for direct buried armoured cables for roadside technology and communications
W/1.5
The depth of excavation for directly buried cables for roadside technology and communications laid
under verges, footways or open ground shall have a minimum cover of 500 mm and 750 mm under
carriageways or 300 mm below formation, whichever is greater in depth.
W/1.6
When cables for roadside technology and communications are laid in a cable trench on an
embankment or a cutting, the depth of fill and materials used to backfill the trench shall be such that the
embankment or cutting does not collapse or subside.
W/1.6.1
Backfill of a cable trench for roadside technology and communications should be as shown in TC 131
[Ref 2.N] unless the site conditions require an alternative construction.
