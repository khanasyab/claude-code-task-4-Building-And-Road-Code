Aug 2020
Revision 1 re-published in August 2020 to correct error on DMRB website. 
Document was incorrectly published as revision 1 in July 2019 instead of 
revision 0 due to a typographical error. The DMRB website showed the 
document as revision 0 and so it has been updated to ensure the website 
matches the version of the document (revision 1). No changes have been 
made between first publication in July 2019 and this administrative amendment 
to the DMRB website. Revision 1 (July 2019) LA 104 replaces HA 205/08, HD 
48/08, IAN 125/15, and IAN 133/10. The full document has been re-written to 
make it compliant with the new Highways England drafting rules.

2. Principles and purpose of environmental asses...
2.
Principles and purpose of environmental assessment
Integration with consent procedures and planning policy
2.1
Environmental assessment, reporting and monitoring must meet the requirements of the EIA Directive
2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
2.2
Environmental assessment, reporting and monitoring shall meet the requirements of the national
planning policy for each relevant Overseeing Organisation.
Screening and scoping
2.3
Environmental assessment shall be informed by the outputs of screening (see LA 102 [Ref 2.I]
Screening) and scoping ( LA 103 [Ref 1.I] Scoping).
2.3.1
Information collated at the screening and scoping stages should provide an understanding of the
environmental issues that require further assessment.
NOTE
The information outlined in this section can supplement the information already collated to inform
environmental assessment.
Assessment and consultation
2.4
Where an EIA is required in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N], projects must
ensure:
1) the public are given early and effective opportunities to participate in environmental decision-making
procedures before consent is given;
2) the public are informed electronically and by public notices or by other appropriate means that an ES
(and other relevant project information) is available;
3) the public are consulted for a minimum of 30 days on the ES;
4) the authorities likely to be concerned by a project are given an opportunity to express their opinion
on the project before consent is given.
NOTE
For non-statutory environmental assessment, it is considered good practice to consult with affected
stakeholders during the design, assessment and consenting process.
Uncertainty
2.5
EIA, undertaken in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N], must include:
1) a description of the main difficulties encountered in compiling the required information; and
2) the main uncertainties involved in the forecasting methods or evidence.
2.6
Non-statutory environmental assessments shall include:
1) a description of the main difficulties encountered in compiling the required information; and
2) the main uncertainties involved in the forecasting methods or evidence.
2.6.1
Reporting of uncertainty should address:
1) the availability and validity of baseline data;
2) the effect of the passage of time on the validity of data; and
3) future changes (e.g. project design) that could affect the conclusions of an environmental
assessment.
NOTE 1
The prediction of environmental effects has inherent uncertainties, which the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU
[Ref 1.N] recognises.
NOTE 2
A level of uncertainty is acceptable provided the prediction of likely environmental effects is supported
by sufficient evidence.

2. Principles and purpose of environmental asses...
Change management
2.7
A change management process shall be implemented throughout the project life cycle to record and
assess design changes.
NOTE 1
The purpose of change management is to record implications for assessment conclusions and
subsequent mitigation and monitoring requirements.
NOTE 2
Where changes are made, for example as a result of design change during construction, it is essential
that assessment conclusions are re-assessed.
NOTE 3
Re-assessing original conclusions helps to identify the need to amend mitigation and monitoring
measures as the design evolves.
2.8
Where a material change including to mitigation and monitoring is proposed post consent, the
implications of this change shall be evaluated, assessed where applicable, and reported prior to their
implementation.

3.9
The assessment of the significance of environmental effects shall cover the following factors:
1) the receptors/resources (natural and human) which would be affected and the pathways for such
effects;
2) the geographic importance, sensitivity or value of receptors/resources;
3) the duration (long or short term); permanence (permanent or temporary) and changes in significance
(increase or decrease);
4) reversibility - e.g. is the change reversible or irreversible, permanent or temporary;
5) environmental and health standards (e.g. local air quality standards) being threatened; and
6) feasibility and mechanisms for delivering mitigating measures, e.g. Is there evidence of the ability to
legally deliver the environmental assumptions which are the basis for the assessment?
Defining the baseline scenario
3.10
The baseline environmental conditions must be defined and described without the project in place
(baseline scenario) in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
3.10.1
The baseline scenario should include a description of the site location and the surrounding area as far
as environmental effects are anticipated.
3.10.2
The baseline scenario should define existing land-uses and environmental receptors/resources
relevant to the environmental factor.
3.10.3
A description should be provided of the likely evolution of the current state of the environment without
implementation of the project i.e. 'future baseline scenario', with reasonable effort on the basis of the
availability of environmental information and scientific knowledge.
3.10.4
When describing the future baseline scenario, readily available information such as local plans,
designated site management plans and climate change scenario data should be utilised to provide a
description of the natural changes in the local environment over an appropriate timescale that the
datasets support.

LA 104 Revision 1
3. Environmental assessment methodology
Defining assessment years and scenarios
3.11
Effects must be assessed and reported by comparing a scenario with the project against one without
the project, in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
NOTE
The scenario without the project and scenario with the project are referred to as the do-minimum and
do-something scenarios respectively.
3.11.1
The likely significant environmental effects for do-something scenarios should be assessed for the
baseline year and future year, or series of future years, depending on the environmental factor.
3.12
The baseline year and future year assumptions shall be reported in the methodology section of the
environmental assessment reports.
3.12.1
The baseline year should represent the conditions prior to implementation of the project, with
consistency across the reporting of all environmental factors.
3.12.2
For assessing construction phase effects, the baseline year should be chosen to represent the
conditions prior to construction starting.
3.12.3
For assessing operation phase effects (such as the effects of traffic on noise and air quality) the
baseline year should be chosen to represent the situation prior to any effect e.g. opening the project to
traffic.
3.12.4
The baseline year used for the purpose of the assessment should be as close as possible to the year in
which the consenting process commences to ensure the baseline information is up to date and
reflective of the current conditions.
3.12.5
Current scientific knowledge and methods of assessment should be used to identify foreseeable
changes.
Defining the study area
3.13
The study area for an assessment shall be clearly defined for each environmental factor at the earliest
opportunity.
3.13.1
The study area for an assessment should reflect the project and the surrounding environment over
which effects are reasonably be thought to occur, taking into account cumulative effects.
3.13.2
For the assessment of cumulative effects, the spatial boundary of the receptor/resource with potential
to be affected directly or indirectly should be defined.
NOTE 1
For some projects, sensitive receptors and resources can be located beyond the immediate environs of
the project e.g. through hydrological pathways.
NOTE 2
Consultation with relevant stakeholders can help to inform the identification of potential
receptors/resources and potential significant effects, and inform the definition of the study area.
Survey and information assembly
3.14
Survey design shall form part of the project planning process to minimise potential delays to delivery
programmes.
NOTE
Certain environmental surveys are seasonal and have set 'windows' for completion.
3.14.1
The need for time sensitive surveys should be identified as early as possible in the option choice,
planning, assessment and design process.
3.14.2
Where justifiable constraints limit the scope of surveys, these should be discussed with authorities
likely to be concerned by a project to determine an appropriate approach and reported appropriately.
3.15
Approval shall be sought from the Overseeing Organisation prior to approaching landowners and
undertaking site visits for surveys.
NOTE
Environmental data collated during the assessment process can help populate asset databases and
inform performance reporting.

LA 104 Revision 1
3. Environmental assessment methodology
Identification of reasonable alternatives
3.16
EIA must report on the following alternatives, in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref
1.N]:
1) technology alternatives: temporary and permanent traffic control measures;
2) design alternatives: of physical elements including structures, and landscaping;
3) size and scale alternatives: seeking opportunities to reduce the size and scale of the development
where the project objectives would not be compromised;
4) demand alternatives: to meet the need through demand management techniques;
5) activity alternatives such as provision of traffic calming instead of a new road;
6) location alternatives: selection of different corridors or access routes; and as a sub-set of these main
alternatives;
7) delivery alternatives: alternatives that reflect different means of delivering the desired end point in
production terms, (for example, a clear span bridge or one with piers and abutments in the river);
8) scheduling alternatives: programming the activities to avoid periods of enhanced environmental
sensitivity, e.g. the consideration of alternative temporary land-take during construction;
9) input alternatives: use of different materials, lighting strategies or different designs;
10) mitigation alternatives: the variety of solutions available to mitigate the adverse consequences of a
proposal;
11) The 'do minimum' and 'do nothing' scenarios.
3.16.1
The level of effort applied to each of the alternative types should be proportionate to the feasibility of
assessment and any benefits that assessment of an alternative can generate.
3.16.2
Evidence of the consideration of alternatives should be reported along with the reason(s) for not
pursuing them.
3.17
Reporting of alternatives within EIAs shall include solution(s) that offer better environmental outcomes
across objectives set by the Overseeing Organisation.
3.18
When investigating solutions that offer the best environmental outcomes across objectives set by the
Overseeing Organisation, non-statutory environmental assessments shall report on the alternatives
listed in 'Identification of reasonable alternatives'.
Cumulative effects
3.19
EIAs must include cumulative effects in accordance with the requirements of the EIA Directive
2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
3.20
Non-statutory environmental assessments shall include cumulative effects.
3.21
Environmental assessments shall assess cumulative effects which include those from:
1) a single project (e.g. numerous different effects impacting a single receptor); and
2) different projects (together with the project being assessed).
3.21.1
Cumulative effects should be assessed when the conclusions of individual environmental factor
assessments have been reached and reported.
3.21.2
The assessment of cumulative effects should report on:
1) roads projects which have been confirmed for delivery over a similar timeframe;
2) other development projects with valid planning permissions or consent orders, and for which EIA is a
requirement; and
3) proposals in adopted development plans with a clear identified programme for delivery.
3.22
The assessment of cumulative effects shall:

LA 104 Revision 1
3. Environmental assessment methodology
1) establish the zone of influence of the project together with other projects;
2) establish a list of projects which have the potential to result in cumulative impacts; and
3) obtain further information and detail on the list of identified projects to support further assessment.
NOTE 1
The assessment of cumulative impacts can be established through a desk study and mapping
exercise, together with a review of planning/development applications and development plans.
NOTE 2
There are no defined limits or criteria for selecting the list of projects for cumulative assessment.
Professional judgement using Annex III of the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N] can be applied and
justification provided for developments selected (and excluded).
NOTE 3
The temporal and spatial scope, together with characteristics of the identified projects, are key
considerations in identifying projects that require further assessment.
NOTE 4
The Overseeing Organisation and/or authorities likely to be concerned by a project can provide
relevant advice on the scope of the assessment of cumulative effects.
Design and mitigation
3.23
Environmental assessment and design shall incorporate mitigation measures using a hierarchical
system as follows:
1) avoidance and prevention: design and mitigation measures to prevent the effect (e.g. alternative
design options or avoidance of environmentally sensitive sites);
2) reduction: where avoidance is not possible, then mitigation is used to lessen the magnitude or
significance of effects;
3) remediation: where it is not possible to avoid or reduce a significant adverse effect, these are
measures to offset the effect.
3.24
Environmental assessment shall report on the following categories of mitigation:
1) embedded mitigation: project design principles adopted to avoid or prevent adverse environmental
effects; and
2) essential mitigation: measures required to reduce and if possible offset likely significant adverse
environmental effects, in support of the reported significance of effects in the environmental
assessment.
3.24.1
Embedded mitigation should be reported in the project description and not repeated in each
environmental factor assessment.
3.24.2
Essential mitigation should be reported in relevant environmental factor assessments.
3.24.3
The Overseeing Organisation should be consulted where a different approach to reporting mitigation
than that outlined above is proposed.
NOTE 1
Early identification of effects and design of mitigation measures serves to:
1) maximise the time available to projects to re-design or make design changes to 'design out'
significant adverse environmental effects;
2) deliver the project in line with objectives and / or policy;
3) identify land required for mitigation enabling early dialogue with stakeholders;
4) maximise the time available to consult with authorities likely to be concerned by a project thereby
ensuring mitigation is well informed and is widely accepted; and
5) minimise costs associated with mitigating effects later in the project lifecycle when design
parameters are 'fixed' and therefore harder to amend.
NOTE 2
Mitigation measures can produce adverse as well as beneficial effects e.g. an environmental noise
barrier can increase visual intrusion.

LA 104 Revision 1
3. Environmental assessment methodology
3.25
Significance of an effect shall be reported after an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and
mitigation measures (the residual effect).
NOTE
Assigning significance to an effect after an assessment of the effectiveness of the design allows for
positive contribution of all mitigation that is effective, deliverable and committed.
3.26
Proposed mitigation measures shall only be taken into account when determining significance if;
1) the success of the features / measures delivering the desired outcome is supported by evidence; and
2) the project has an identified legal mechanism for implementing the features/measures.
3.27
The costs of the construction and establishment of any mitigation measures that form the basis of
environmental assessment shall be included in the project budget.
NOTE
The most cost effective and environmentally acceptable solutions can be delivered where potential
environmental effects are given early consideration.
Environmental enhancement
3.28
Enhancement opportunities shall be reported within the environmental assessment.
3.28.1
The following items may be relevant to the design and delivery of enhancement opportunities:
1) national and local policy requirements;
2) policy and performance requirements of the Overseeing Organisation;
3) project specific objectives.
NOTE 1
Early identification of the cost of enhancement measures helps inform decision making by the
Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE 2
Where essential mitigation is being delivered for other purposes, this offers an enhancement
opportunity where it does not compromise the original objective of that land.

Reporting of environmental assessments
Good practice principles
4.1
The following principles shall be implemented as part of an environmental assessment:
1) consistent, clear presentation and referencing with little or no duplication of information.
2) coordination between environmental factors to prevent effects being overlooked or reported multiple
times.
3) unbiased, impartial presentation of the assessment findings.
4) a quantified and objective approach adopted with a distinction made between fact, assumptions and
professional judgement.
Environmental factors
4.2
EIA undertaken in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N] must report against the
following factors:
1) air quality;
2) cultural heritage;
3) landscape;
4) biodiversity;
5) geology and soils;
6) material assets and waste;
7) noise and vibration;
8) population and human health;
9) road drainage and the water environment;
10) climate.
4.3
Non-statutory environmental assessment shall report against the factors listed in 'Environmental
factors'.
NOTE
Scoping determines the extent of reporting against each of these factors.
4.4
When reporting against factors on the above environmental factors, the requirements of the
Overseeing Organisation shall be applied.
Heat and radiation
4.5
The potential impact of heat and radiation from a project must be reported within ESs in accordance
with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
NOTE
Heat and radiation is unlikely to be relevant to the scope of most motorway and all-purpose trunk road
projects.
4.6
The potential impact of heat and radiation from a project shall be reported within non-statutory
environmental assessment reports.
4.7
Where heat and radiation are scoped out, evidence supporting the approach shall be outlined within the
project characteristics section of the environmental assessment.
4.8
Where heat and radiation are scoped in, advice shall be sought from the Overseeing Organisation on
the assessment scope and method.
Major accidents and disasters
4.9
When scoping major accidents and disasters (hereafter referred to as major events), an assessment
shall be made of the following:

======================================================================
LA 104 Revision 1
4. Reporting of environmental assessments
1) vulnerability of the project to risks of major events; and
2) any consequential changes in the predicted effects of that project on environmental factors.
4.10
Major events shall include both man-made and naturally occurring events.
NOTE
There is no definition of major events within the relevant legislation.
4.10.1
When scoping major events, projects should:
1) apply professional judgement, in consultation with the Overseeing Organisation, to develop project
specific definitions of major events;
2) identify any major events that are relevant to and can affect a project.
3) describe the potential for any change in the assessed significance of the project on relevant
environmental factors in qualitative terms;
4) report the conclusions of this assessment within the individual environmental factors; and
5) clearly describe any assumed mitigation measures, to evidence assessment conclusions and
demonstrate that likely effects have been mitigated and managed to an acceptable level.
4.10.2
Not all events warrant assessment and evidence should be provided to support the view that they are
classified as major events.
4.11
Evidence supporting the approach to assessing major events shall be outlined within the project
characteristics and methodology sections of the environmental assessment.
4.12
Major events shall be reported within the relevant environmental factors agreed during scoping.
Environmental statement
4.13
An ES must contain (as a minimum) the information outlined in Annex IV of the EIA Directive
2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
NOTE 1
The ES is a statutory reporting procedure for projects that have been identified as being likely to cause
significant environmental effect(s).
NOTE 2
The aim of the ES is to:
1) fulfil statutory obligations under the EIA Regulations 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N];
2) fulfil statutory obligations for public access to environmental information under EU Directive
2003/4/EC 2003/4/EC [Ref 4.N];
3) satisfy the Overseeing Organisation's internal communication needs and approval processes;
4) provide the public with an accessible document from which they can express their opinions;
5) provide an audit trail for decision makers;
6) provide a basis for identification and delivery of mitigation; and
7) provide a basis for monitoring, auditing and management of environmental mitigation and
enhancement measures.
4.14
The specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisation shall apply to the structure of ES.
Non-technical summary
4.15
Where EIA is undertaken, a non-technical summary (NTS) must be prepared alongside the ES in
accordance with the requirements of the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
4.16
Where an NTS is prepared, it must contain a summary of the information contained within the ES as
outlined in Annex IV of the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
4.16.1
An NTS should highlight the principal findings of the associated ES without using technical jargon and
abbreviations.

4. Reporting of environmental assessments
Describing the project
4.17
Environmental assessments must clearly describe the project and its characteristics in accordance with
the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
4.17.1
Plans and/or figures should be used to support the description of a project.
4.17.2
Temporary and permanent land use requirements should be defined when describing a project.
4.17.3
When defining a project, the physical characteristics of the development should be described, with
references to their size, nature and purpose, including any requisite demolition works.
4.17.4
Where the scale or design of elements has not been fixed in a project, the parameters of the
development should be defined.
4.17.5
Environmental assessments should be undertaken using a realistic 'worst case' scenario.
4.17.6
Environmental design input should be sought at the earliest stage possible to allow sufficient time to
facilitate design changes and completion of further assessment as required.
NOTE 1
The definition of a 'worst case' scenario can vary between environmental factors.
NOTE 2
Approaches such as the Rochdale Envelope principle can allow environmental assessment to proceed,
within a number of agreed parameters, where details of a project are broadly defined.
Non-statutory environmental assessment
4.18
The content of non-statutory environmental assessment shall be agreed through scoping LA 103 [Ref
1.I] Scoping projects for environmental assessment.
4.18.1
Non-statutory environmental assessment should provide a record of an appropriate and proportionate
level of environmental assessment, as no significant environmental effects should be reported.
4.19
The specific requirements of the Overseeing Organisations shall apply for non-statutory environmental
assessment.

5. Monitoring of significant adverse effects
5.
Monitoring of significant adverse effects
General principles
5.1
Where ES's conclude that there are significant adverse environmental effects, projects must undertake
proportionate monitoring of associated mitigation measures, in accordance with the EIA Directive
2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
NOTE
The purpose of monitoring is to:
1) ensure measures envisaged to avoid, prevent or reduce and, if possible, offset significant adverse
effects on the environment are delivered;
2) build data on the effectiveness of design and mitigation measures thereby driving improvement in
environmental performance for future projects;
3) satisfy licence / permit requirements (where applicable); and
4) identify remedial action as a consequence of underperformance or failure of mitigation.
5.2
The type of parameters to be monitored and the duration of the monitoring, reported within ESs, must
be proportionate to the nature, location and size of the project and the significance of its effects on the
environment, in accordance with the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU [Ref 1.N].
5.3
Existing monitoring arrangements which are in place as a result of other European or national
legislation shall be used if appropriate to avoid any duplication of monitoring.
5.3.1
The need for environmental monitoring should be assessed throughout the lifecycle of the project from
inception to the commencement of the statutory process.
5.3.2
Monitoring measures should be undertaken as required during construction, handover and through the
operation and maintenance periods.
5.4
Mitigation and monitoring measures shall be identified and developed through the design and
environmental assessment process and initially documented in the ES or the non-statutory EAR.
NOTE
Further environmental mitigation and monitoring requirements are set out in other documents, for
example the flood risk assessment, statutory permit / licence conditions and stakeholder commitments.
5.5
The monitoring requirements of a project shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation and / or
competent authority, in consultation with relevant stakeholders as required.
Reporting monitoring measures
5.6
The results of monitoring shall be reported through updates of the environmental management plan
(EMP) during construction and handover phases.
5.6.1
An EMP should set out the mitigation needed to manage environmental effects associated with a
project and identify all necessary measures to avoid, reduce and offset a project's environmental
impact and the methods for implementation.
5.6.2
An EMP should set out the statutory monitoring commitments, including the need to evaluate the
monitoring, identify remedial actions and report on environmental monitoring.
5.6.3
All environmental management actions recorded in an EMP should be specific, measureable,
achievable, reportable and timely (SMART).
5.6.4
Environmental management actions should include all monitoring requirements, success criteria, and
specify a mechanism for reporting on progress against environmental requirements and commitments.
5.7
The EMP shall be used as a method of reporting specific monitoring and management measures post
consent.
5.7.1
The EMP should be an iterative document and continually updated to reflect progress on achieving the
identified actions throughout the project lifecycle and respond to any assessment assumption and
design changes identified by the change management process.

LA 104 Revision 0
E/1. Planning Act 2008 (as amended)
E/1.
Planning Act 2008 (as amended)
Principles and purpose of environmental assessment
E/1.1
Nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs) require environmental assessment and shall
undertake either:
1) an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (hereafter referred to at the IP EIA
Regulations) [Ref 3.N]; or
2) a non-statutory environmental assessment.
NOTE
The process of deciding whether an EIA is required for an NSIP is set out in LA 102 [Ref 1.I] Screening
projects for Environmental Impact Assessment.
E/1.2
The IP EIA Regulations [Ref 3.N] transpose the principles set out in the EIA Directive [Ref 1.N] for
NSIPs, and must be applied to all NSIPs required to undertake an EIA.
E/1.3
Non-statutory environmental assessments for NSIPs shall follow the procedures set out in LA 103 [Ref
7.N] Scoping projects for environmental assessment and LA 104 [Ref 2.N] Environmental assessment
and monitoring.
Reporting
E/1.4
Environmental statements and non-statutory environmental assessment reports shall report against the
environmental factors outlined in E/1.
E/1.5
All NSIPs must demonstrate that the environmental assessment requirements of the national networks
national policy statement (NN NPS) [Ref 5.N] have been addressed.
E/1.6
The Planning Inspectorate (PINS) has developed methodology set out in Advice Note Seventeen:
Cumulative effects assessment relevant to nationally significant infrastructure projects [Ref 2.I] which
shall be applied to all NSIP environmental assessments.
NOTE
PINS Advice Note Seventeen: Cumulative effects assessment relevant to nationally significant
infrastructure projects can be used when undertaking the environmental assessment of NSIPs
alongside this National Application Annex.
E/1.7
All NSIPs shall ensure that any environmental management plan (EMP) is secured within the
development consent order (DCO).
E/1.8
Where the change management process (refer to LA 104 [Ref 2.N] Environmental assessment and
monitoring) identifies a material change, NSIPs must follow the requirements of The Infrastructure
Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011 (as
amended) [Ref 9.N] in respect to environment assessment reporting.
NOTE
PINS Advice Note Sixteen: How to request a change which may be material [Ref 3.I] can be used to
inform the material change process alongside this National Application Annex.
Environmental assessment and consultation
E/1.9
All NSIPs must adhere to the consultation and publication requirements in the Planning Act 2008 (as
amended) [Ref 6.N] and The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure)
Regulations 2009 (as amended) (hereafter referred to as the APFP Regulations) [Ref 8.N].
E/1.10
Where an EIA is required, the publication and notification requirements of the IP EIA Regulations [Ref
3.N] must be applied.
E/1.11
Where an EIA is required, NSIPs must publicise and consult on preliminary environmental information
in accordance with the requirements of the IP EIA Regulations [Ref 3.N].
NOTE
PINS Advice Note Three: EIA Consultation and Notification [Ref 4.I] can be used when undertaking the
publication, notification and consultation requirements of NSIPs alongside this National Application
Annex.

W/1.1
Environmental assessment, reporting and monitoring shall meet the requirements of the:
1) EIA Directive [Ref 2.N];
2) Highways Act, 1980 (as amended) [Ref 5.N] ; and,
3) Planning Policy Wales, Edition 9 [Ref 7.N] or its successor.
NOTE
Highways Act, 1980 (as amended) [Ref 5.N] includes The Environmental Impact Assessment
(Miscellaneous Amendments Relating to Harbours, Highways and Transport) Regulations 2017 [Ref
9.N].
W/1.2
Where a material change to mitigation and monitoring is proposed post consent, the implications of this
change shall be evaluated and assessed against the Environmental Statement conclusions and other
relevant assessments.
W/1.2.1
The project authority should be consulted on any consequential change to mitigation and monitoring
prior to implementation.
Environmental assessment methodology
W/1.3
The assessment of cumulative effects shall adhere to the requirements of LA 104 [Ref 3.N]
Environmental assessment and monitoring.
W/1.3.1

Significance of an effect shall be reported before and after an assessment of the effectiveness of the
design and mitigation measures.
NOTE 1
The residual effect is the significance after mitigation is applied.
NOTE 2
Assigning significance to an effect after an assessment of the effectiveness of the design allows for
positive contribution of all mitigation that is effective, deliverable and committed.
W/1.5
The costs of the construction and establishment of any mitigation measures that form the basis of
environmental assessment shall be included in the project budget.
NOTE
The most cost effective and environmentally acceptable solutions can be delivered where potential
environmental effects are given early consideration.
