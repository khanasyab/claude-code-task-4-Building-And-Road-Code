3. Assessment methodology
3.
Assessment methodology
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall document the initial baseline studies undertaken and make a
recommendation on the scope of further assessment.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall address the following questions to gain an understanding of the need to
undertake further cultural heritage assessment:
1) is any designated or other cultural heritage resource in the footprint of the scheme or outside that
footprint but still potentially physically affected by it?;
2) is the setting of any designated or other cultural heritage resource in the footprint of the scheme,
within the zone of visual influence or potentially affected by noise (see LA 111 [Ref 13.I])?;
3) is there new land take associated with the project?;
4) could potential archaeological remains be concealed?
3.3
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
3.4
Scoping shall apply established and reliable design, mitigation and best practice measures when
reporting against the scoping assessment questions.
Study area
3.5
Where the need for further assessment has been established, the assessment shall define a study area
according to the sensitivity of the receiving environment and the potential impacts of the project.
3.6
Where a new road is proposed the study area shall include the footprint of the scheme plus any land
outside that footprint which includes any heritage assets which could be physically affected.
3.6.1
The study area should include the settings of any designated or other cultural heritage resource in the
footprint of the scheme or within the zone of visual influence or potentially affected by noise (see LA
111 [Ref 13.I]).
3.7
The study area used in the assessment shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
Baseline scenario
3.8
The baseline scenario shall define the existing designated and undesignated cultural heritage resource
CIFA desk-based assessment [Ref 2.N].
3.9
Where desk-based studies suggest that available information is inadequate for the purpose of the
assessment, field surveys shall be undertaken to enhance the data CIFA Standards [Ref 1.I], CIFA
Field evaluation [Ref 3.I] and CIFA Geophysics [Ref 4.I].
3.9.1
In addition to national registers and local cultural heritage records, historical maps and aerial
photographs, relevant books, journals, previous reports, LiDAR and geotechnical data may be
consulted.
Significance criteria
3.10
Assigning value (sensitivity), magnitude of impact and significance of effect and reporting the significant
effects of a project on cultural heritage resource and its settings shall follow the requirements in LA 104
[Ref 4.N] Environmental assessment and monitoring.
3.11
Where a cultural heritage resource falls in a different value (sensitivity) category to that required by its
designation and LA 104 [Ref 4.N], the approval of the Overseeing Organisation shall be sought.
NOTE 1
The effect on the cultural heritage resource is not significant when the impact does not substantially
diminish the heritage interest of the cultural heritage resource.

LA 106 Revision 1
3. Assessment methodology
NOTE 2
For example, a milestone in the lowest listed building category which has already been moved twice
can be of medium rather than high value, or a scheduled Roman town which has previously been a
candidate world heritage site but has been held to not meet the inscription criteria can still be of very
high value.
Design and mitigation
Design
3.12
Cultural heritage design objectives shall be developed for the project in accordance with national,
regional and local policies, priorities and objectives.
3.12.1
The cultural heritage design objectives should provide a clear statement of how the project, through
mitigation, is expected to contribute to the value of, or the understanding and dissemination of, the
cultural heritage resource, and how this is to be achieved, monitored and validated.
NOTE
Where archaeological research frameworks exist they are to guide the cultural heritage design
objectives.
Mitigation
3.13
Mitigation measures shall be identified where remediation of a likely significant effect is necessary, as it
cannot be avoided, prevented or reduced in accordance with the requirements of LA 104 [Ref 4.N].
3.13.1
Mitigation measures should be identified on a case-by-case basis.
NOTE
Mitigation measures can include:
1) avoidance, preservation by burial, or investigation in the case of archaeological remains;
2) relocation, photographic or drawn to scale surveys in the case of historic buildings;
3) recording, information panels or landscape works in the case of impacts on historic landscapes; and
4) reduction to impact on setting through screening or landscaping.
3.13.2
Programmes of investigation should be undertaken to mitigate the impact on cultural heritage resource
where it cannot be avoided.
NOTE 1
Programmes of investigation deliver mitigation by addressing the adverse effect of a project on
archaeology even when the cultural heritage resource is destroyed or altered.
NOTE 2
The destruction of the archaeology without a programme of investigation to understand the cultural
heritage resource is the worse option.
NOTE 3
The Chartered Institute for Archaeologists provides standards and guidance on many of the activities
which can constitute mitigation CIFA Archives [Ref 9.I], CIFA Standing buildings [Ref 7.I], CIFA
Documentation [Ref 8.I], CIFA consultancy advice [Ref 6.I], CIFA Excavation [Ref 2.I], CIFA Field
evaluation [Ref 3.I], CIFA Geophysics [Ref 4.I], CIFA Nautical guidance [Ref 5.I], CIFA Watching brief
[Ref 14.I] and CIFA Standards [Ref 1.I].
3.14
Mitigation measures that address an adverse effect through a programme of investigation shall not be
reported as a beneficial effect, despite any contribution such an investigation makes to design
objectives.
3.15
Where a project is not delivered, or where no further cultural heritage work is undertaken beyond the
assessment stage, the analysis and publication, including popular dissemination, of any original cultural
heritage work shall be completed.
