Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document provides requirements and advice on:
1) the measurement of vehicle speeds on existing all-purpose trunk roads; and
2) how to calculate 85th percentile speeds.
The primary purpose of this document is to provide a consistent approach to measuring and calculating
85th percentile speeds. It describes methods that are to be used when obtaining speed data using
manual or automatic measurement methods.
The data derived using this document can be used where existing vehicle speeds are necessary to set
the basis for design. Such schemes can include the setting of speed limits, minor improvements to
existing roads and altering or designing new priority junctions, accesses or signal controlled junctions.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 1.N] apply to this document.

Vehicle speed measurement
Spot speed and journey speed measurements
Speed limits
2.1
When speed limits are to be determined based on speed measurement, one of the following methods
shall be used:
1) spot speed measurements of cars only; or
2) spot speed measurements of all motor vehicle types with a conversion factor applied.
NOTE 1
Section 3 of this document includes the conversion factor to be applied when calculating 85th
percentile speeds for the purpose of determining speed limits based on spot speed measurements of
all motor vehicle types.
NOTE 2
Department for Transport Circular 01/2013 ( DfT Circular 01/2013 [Ref 1.I]) provides advice on setting
speed limits.
Traffic signal installations
2.2
When design parameters for traffic signal installations are to be determined based on speed
measurement, spot speed measurements of all motor vehicle types shall be used.
2.2.1
Spot speed measurements on the approach to proposed, upgraded and existing traffic signal
installations should be taken between 150 and 200 metres back from the existing/proposed stop line
but as close to 160 metres as practicable.
2.2.2
Spot speed measurements on the approach to proposed, upgraded and existing traffic signal
installations should be taken where there are no parked vehicles within 100 metres of the measurement
point.
2.2.3
Spot speed measurements on the approach to existing signal controlled junctions should be taken:
1) when traffic flows are between 20% to 40% of the maximum capacity of the junction; and
2) only during a green phase where no queues are present.
Other scheme types
2.3
When design parameters for anything other than speed limits and traffic signal installations are to be
determined based on speed measurement, journey speeds of all motor vehicle types shall be used.
NOTE
Journey speed measurements are used for highway schemes such as new priority junctions/direct
access and minor improvements to existing roads etc.
2.4
Measurements for journey speed shall be taken on the approaches to the scheme extents.
NOTE
Measuring journey speeds on the approaches to the scheme extents can be achieved by matching
registration numbers at the time of passing the two points.
Free flow conditions
2.5
All speed measurements (spot and journey speed) shall be undertaken in free flow conditions where
vehicles are unlikely to be accelerating or braking, unless the measurements are to be taken in
connection with changes to an existing feature that naturally impacts the free flow of traffic.
NOTE 1
Examples of where the road geometry can cause vehicles to slow down and speed up (or
accelerate/brake) include isolated sharp bends, gradients and road narrowings.
NOTE 2
Improvements to an existing junction is an example of where speed measurements can be taken in
conditions that are not entirely free flow.

2. Vehicle speed measurement
NOTE 3
In urban environments such as residential streets where persistent parking is typical, it would not be
possible to undertake speed measurements in entirely free-flow conditions. In this particular scenario,
the persistent parking can be considered a feature that naturally impacts the free flow of traffic and
therefore equivalent to free-flow conditions.
2.5.1
All speed measurements should be taken in dry weather conditions.
Minimum number of vehicles speeds to be recorded
2.6
A minimum of 200 vehicles speeds shall be recorded during each individual speed measurement
period.
2.6.1
As many vehicles speeds as practicable should be recorded during each individual speed
measurement period.
2.6.2
Similar numbers of vehicles speeds should be recorded as part of each individual speed measurement
period and for each direction of travel in the case of two-way roads.
Speed measurement frequency and timing
2.7
Spot speed and journey speed measurements shall comprise a minimum of two individual speed
measurement periods, undertaken on different days of the week, and at different times of the day.
2.8
On two-way roads, the individual speed measurement periods shall include separate measurements
taken for both directions of traffic flow.
2.8.1
The minimum two individual speed measurement periods should be undertaken in different months and
at least one month apart from each other, or in a neutral month if the former is not feasible.
2.8.2
Speed measurements should be undertaken outside of peak traffic flow periods.
NOTE 1
Non-peak periods are typically between 10am and noon and 2pm and 4pm. In some cases these times
need to be varied to take account of site specific circumstance e.g. if a school is nearby that closes at
3pm.
NOTE 2
A neutral month is a month that is not impacted by seasonal variation in traffic flows. Typical neutral
months are April, May, June, September and October.
2.9
Speed measurements shall not be undertaken during a local event that can result in traffic flows and
speeds that are atypical for the road in question.
NOTE
Local events can include market days, local holidays, fetes and race meetings etc. It can also include
situations where traffic is diverted along the route in question due to road works occurring on other
parts of the network.
2.10
Speed measurements shall not be undertaken at weekends.
2.11
Speed measurements on rural roads shall not be undertaken on bank holidays.
2.11.1
Speed measurements on urban roads should not be undertaken on bank holidays.
2.12
Where there is a difference in the 85th percentile speeds derived from the individual speed
measurements periods, the higher value shall be used in the subsequent design.
Speed measurement methods
2.13
Speed measurements shall be undertaken using either manual or automatic methods.
NOTE
A variety of manual and automated methods of speed measurement are available, including:
1) handheld radar speedometers (manual);
2) radar traffic classifiers (automated);
3) pneumatic tubes (automated);
4) inductive loops (automated).

2. Vehicle speed measurement
Automatic speed measurement methods
2.14
When installing and operating automatic speed measurement equipment, the manufacturer's
installation and operating instructions shall be followed.
NOTE
Automated speed measurements can reduce the risk of errors, provide greater volumes of data and
reduce the risk of the results being artificially skewed (as a result of a the presence of a surveyor
influencing driver behaviour); however, equipment such as inductive loops and pneumatic tubes can
not always fully distinguish between different vehicle types due to classification being based on axle
spacing. In this situation a correction factor can be applied (refer to Section 3: 85th percentile speed
calculation)
2.14.1
Vehicle speed measurement tools should be checked for accuracy prior to a survey being undertaken.
NOTE
A vehicle fitted with a calibrated speedometer can be used on site for a broad check of the accuracy of
the readings given by the vehicle speed measurement tools being used.
Manual speed measurement methods
2.15
For dual carriageway roads, speed measurements using manual methods shall be conducted on the
same side of the road as the flow of traffic that is being surveyed.
2.15.1
For single carriageway roads, speed measurements using manual methods should be conducted on
the same side of the carriageway as the flow of traffic that is being surveyed.
2.15.2
For manual speed measurements, as many of the vehicles that pass during a particular survey period
should be recorded as possible.
2.15.3
A minimum of two surveyors should be utilised when undertaking manual speed measurements.
NOTE 1
The use of a minimum of two surveyors (one taking readings and the other recording them) allows for a
greater proportion of all passing vehicles to be recorded, if not all of them. It also helps to reduce errors
and produce a more robust data set.
NOTE 2
A sampling method can be used if traffic flows are too high to allow all or most vehicles to be surveyed
using manual methods.
2.16
Any sampling technique used for manual methods of speed measurement shall be unbiased.
NOTE 1
A unbiased sampling technique needs to be representative of the overall vehicle speeds during the
survey period. A method that looks to record the vehicle speed of every 'x' number of vehicles where 'x'
can provide sufficient time to measure and record the data could be used.
NOTE 2
On dual carriageways, surveys can be completed for specific lanes at a time to reduce the risk of
vehicles being missed when trying to measure vehicle speeds across multiple lanes at the same time.
The results of these individual lane surveys can then be added together to provide a set of results for
the carriageway as a whole.
2.16.1
When undertaking manual speed measurements, surveyors and their equipment (such as a vehicle)
should not be located in a position that impacts the speed or flow of vehicles.
NOTE
Surveyors at the side of a road with a radar device in clear view of approaching traffic can potentially
artificially skew traffic speeds as motorists can slow down as a result. Surveyors situated in a vehicle
away from the carriageway with their equipment positioned inconspicuously reduces this risk.

3. 85th percentile speed calculation
3.
85th percentile speed calculation
3.1
85th percentile vehicle speeds shall be calculated where designs are to be based on measured vehicle
speeds.
NOTE 1
85th percentile vehicle speeds can be calculated using a variety of methods, including:
1) built-in functions in spreadsheet software;
2) statistical formulae; and
3) listing out the measured speeds in ascending order and counting down from the highest value until
15% of the values have been passed (the value that is arrived at is the 85th percentile speed).
NOTE 2
The method of listing out the measured speeds in ascending order and counting down to establish the
85th percentile is only suitable for samples that include 200 or more vehicles.
3.1.1
Where speed measurements have been taken either partially or entirely in wet weather conditions, the
following values should be added to each individual speed recorded in wet weather:
1) 8kph for dual carriageways; and
2) 4kph for single carriageways.
NOTE
Wet weather conditions includes periods after rainfall when the road surface is still wet.
3.1.2
Equations 3.1.2a to 3.1.2d should be used to derive the 85th percentile speed when using the statistical
formula method.
Equation 3.1.2a 85th percentile speed
p85 = m + s
where:
p 85
is the 85th percentile speed
m
is the mean of the measured vehicle speeds
s
is standard deviation of the measured vehicle speeds
Equation 3.1.2b Mean of the measured vehicle speeds
m =
∑v
n
where:
∑v
is the sum of all measured vehicle speeds
n
is the number of measured vehicle speeds
Equation 3.1.2c Standard deviation of measured vehicle speeds
s =
√∑(v −m)2
n −1
Equation 3.1.2d provides a useful relationship to assist in deriving ∑(v −m)2

3. 85th percentile speed calculation
Equation 3.1.2d Additional formula for deriving the standard deviation of measured vehicle
speeds
∑
(v −m)2 =
∑
v2 −(∑v)2
n
NOTE 1
The formula given in Equation 3.1.2a is based on the established shape of speed distributions, which
are to all intents and purposes normal (Gaussian). For a normal distribution, the 85th percentile is
1.037 standard deviations above the mean.
NOTE 2
The value derived using Equation 3.1.2a is rounded to the nearest whole number.
NOTE 3
The standard deviation (s) is approximately one sixth of the mean (m). This relationship can be used as
a quick check to determine if the standard deviation calculated using Equation 3.1.2c is likely to be
correct.
NOTE 4
Figure 3.1.2N4 provides a worked example of how to calculate the 85th percentile speed using
Equations 3.1.2a to 3.1.2d. In this example, a spot speed survey recorded the speeds of 200 vehicles.
The sum of the 200 vehicle speeds equals 9,400 and the sum of the squares of the 200 vehicle speeds
equals 450,810. Rounding to the closest whole number gives an 85th percentile speed of 54kph.
Figure 3.1.2N4 Example of how to derive 85th percentile speed using equations
3.1.2a to 3.1.2d.
3.2
For the setting of speed limits where the speeds of all motor vehicle types have been used, the
following shall be added to the calculated 85th percentile speed for every 15% of heavy good vehicles
in the sample:
1) 1kph for single carriageway roads; and
2) 2kph for dual carriageway roads.
NOTE
When speed measurements that include all motor vehicle types are used for the purpose of setting
speed limits, it is necessary to adjust the calculated 85th percentage speed based on the percentage of
heavy goods vehicles in the sample. The adjustment ensures that the resultant 85th percentile speed
reflects that of cars only.
