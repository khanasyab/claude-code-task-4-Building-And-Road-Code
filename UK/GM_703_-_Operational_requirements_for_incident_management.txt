Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex sets out Highways England's asset delivery specific requirements in
relation to incident management on motorway and all purpose trunk roads. This document contributes
to facilitating a coordinated multi-agency approach to incident management
The collaborative implementation of Highways England's policies and operational documentation,
seeks to facilitate a coordinated multi-agency approach to incident management that is consistent
across all incident response stakeholders.
Incident management is defined as a plan that allows all incident responders to work in a structured,
disciplined, coordinated and controlled manner for an effective and timely resolution to incidents. It is a
systematic and coordinated use of human, institutional, mechanical and technical resources to safely
manage and resolve incidents in an effective, efficient and expeditious way.
Effective incident management requires a clear understanding of each incident responder's roles and
responsibilities, maintaining clear lines of communication at all times and transferring or escalating
responsibility for command and control of an incident when appropriate to do so.
This document provides a framework supporting collaboration between the following incident
responders:
1) on-road and control room traffic officers;
2) emergency services;
3) private vehicle recovery operators (VRO);
4) next generation vehicle recovery operator (NGVR); and
5) bodies responsible for maintenance and operations.
This document outlines the requirements for a consistent, collaborative, coordinated and flexible
process, to be adhered to by all relevant incident stakeholders, for the varied incident management
activities undertaken on motorway and all purpose trunk roads.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Actions
E/3.2
Carriageway capacity shall only be compromised, where necessary, for reasons related to the safety of
persons on scene, road-user safety, preservation of life or activities being undertaken to address
criminality.
Virtual patrolling
E/3.3
Virtual patrolling shall be undertaken by control staff whenever technology / resources are available to
monitor:
1) all sections of the motorway and all purpose trunk roads where CCTV exists;
2) all smart motorway places of relative safety;
3) specific sections where there is likely to be a heightened rate of incidents i.e. during severe weather
or where historical incident data justifies particular monitoring;
4) the re-opening of carriageways following closures; and
5) all short and long term road-works for unplanned circumstances that have the potential to adversely
affect safety or traffic flows.
Initial response
E/3.4
The following parties shall be relied upon as trusted sources when communicating information:
1) traffic officers (TOs) and inspectors;
2) police officers;
3) fire and rescue service staff; and

Where an incident is discovered, or there is a change of incident status, all relevant details shall be
collated and communicated to the Regional Operations Centre (ROC).
E/3.6
Where there is a report or discovery of an incident, or at the request of an on-road incident responder,
variable signs and signals (VSS) appropriate to that incident shall be set.
NOTE
The VSS policy and traffic officer work instructions determine what signs and signals are appropriate.
E/3.7
Where an incident is reported, the relevant incident responder control rooms shall be informed and
provided with details of current or anticipated incident type, prediction of duration, severity and any
change in status.
NOTE
Timely collaboration and deployment of resources can have a positive impact on early incident
resolution.

1) *1 Can be the Traffic Officers or the Contractor.
2) *2 Refers to those Incidents of which the Contractor has no knowledge until they are passed to the
Contractor's via Highways England's Regional Operations Centre (ROC) from TOs, Emergency
Services, Others or Contractor resource which cannot work on live lane Incidents. The
measurement period starts when the notification communication ends. In each region a ROC is the
day-to-day eyes and ears of our motorway and all-purpose trunk road network, through network
operation, network management, customer contact and incident management.
3) *3 The Contractor Assessment supplied to Highways England captures, but is not be limited to the
Incident's impact to the motorway and all-purpose trunk roads assets, the incident's impact to the
operation of the motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, the incident's impact to adjacent
communities, activities required recovering the asset, within Contractor's scope, or within the scope
of an external contractor or third party and activities required to mitigate the Incident impact upon the
operation of the motorway and all-purpose trunk road network.
4) *4 Describes the situation when a live running lane is partially or fully obstructed by an Incident.
5) *5 Describes the situation when a live running lane, which was partially or fully obstructed by an
Incident, fully re-opens.
6) *6 Refers to those Incidents of which the Contractor has no knowledge until they discover them
whilst carrying out other duties on the motorway and all-purpose trunk roads. Self-identified
Incidents are only those which are discovered by Contractor resource which can work on live lane
Incidents. The measurement period starts when the Incident is discovered.
7) *7 'Day' is 0400 – 2000 hrs.
8) *8 'Night' is 2000 – 0400 hrs.
9) *9 Classification of 'Heavy' and 'Light' traffic levels across the motorway and all-purpose trunk roads
are detailed and made available by each Highways England region, and will be agreed with the
Highways England Operational Director.

Compiling the Incident response plan
The purpose of the incident response plan (IRP) is to clearly document how incident management and
resolution activities will be undertaken within each asset delivery region. The IRP should be compiled
following collaboration and input from relevant Highways England staff and associated maintenance
and response (M&R) contractors, clearly highlighting how employee and customer safety are upheld
and maintained throughout the incident timeline.
