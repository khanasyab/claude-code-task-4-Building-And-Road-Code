Introduction
Introduction
Background
The UK has made commitments to tackle the root cause of climate change by reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as to increase the resilience of development and infrastructure to the
changing climate.
The Climate Change Act 2008 SI No. 1056 CCA 2008 [Ref 10.N] sets a target to reduce net GHG
emissions by 100% from 1990 levels by the year 2050.
The effective assessment and management of impacts on climate, as well as the effects of climate
change on projects offers the opportunity to:
1) improve the resilience of projects to future climate conditions, such as increased risk and severity of
flooding, drought, heatwaves, intense rainfall events and other extreme weather events; and
2) reduce the impact of projects on climate by minimising the magnitude of GHG emissions as far as
possible.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 6.N] apply to this document.

Principles and purpose
Integration with consent procedures and planning policy
2.1
Projects shall use the assessment and design process to demonstrate their contribution to reduced
GHG emissions in line with the EIA Directive 2011/92/EU [Ref 1.N] and the Climate Change Act 2008
SI No. 1056 CCA 2008 [Ref 10.N].
NOTE 1
The Climate Change Act 2008 SI No. 1056 CCA 2008 [Ref 10.N], sets out a target to reduce by 100%
the net UK carbon account by 2050 when compared to the 1990 baseline, or the baseline of the
relevant transposing national regulations.
NOTE 2
The assessment of GHG emissions early in the life cycle of a project offers the greatest potential for the
reduction of GHGs.
Assessment and consultation
2.2
The assessment and reporting shall identify the scale and nature of GHG emissions across the whole
project life cycle, taking into account design and mitigation measures already incorporated into the
project.
2.2.1
The assessment should report on construction and operational (maintenance and user) GHG
emissions.
2.3
Decommissioning associated with a proposed project shall be excluded from assessment of climate
(for both impacts on climate and vulnerability of projects to climate change) due to the length of the
asset operational phase.
2.3.1
The assessment of climate should report on demolition where an existing asset requires removal prior
to construction of a proposed asset.
2.4
Projects shall minimise their vulnerability against the negative effects of projected climate change
through appropriate design and mitigation measures.
2.5
The assessment and reporting of the effects on climate shall be undertaken in accordance with the
sustainability principles outlined in GG 103 [Ref 4.N].
2.6
The assessment and reporting of the effects on climate shall be undertaken in accordance with the
requirements in the four over-arching environmental assessment documents:
1) LA 101 [Ref 5.N] Introduction to environmental assessment;
2) LA 102 [Ref 9.N] Screening projects for Environmental Impact Assessment;
3) LA 103 [Ref 8.N] Scoping projects for environmental assessment;
4) LA 104 [Ref 2.N] Environmental assessment & monitoring.
2.7
The principles of PAS 2080:2016 specification on infrastructure carbon management PAS 2080 2016
[Ref 1.I] (with the exception of setting project level carbon reduction targets) shall be used to inform the
assessment of projects on climate and supplement the guidance contained herein.
2.8
Where potential trans-boundary impacts are predicted, projects shall consult with the relevant planning
authorities likely to be concerned.

Assessment methodology
Impact of projects on climate (GHG Emissions)
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall report on the likely additional and avoided GHG emissions at each life
cycle stage of the project, in comparison with current and future baseline GHG emissions.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall report on the nature and scale of GHG emissions (positive, neutral or
negative) and the likelihood of significant effects.
3.3
The scoping assessment shall report on the following questions to gain an understanding of the need to
undertake further assessment:
1) are construction GHG emissions (or GHG-emitting activity), compared to the baseline scenario (i.e.
when compared to GHG emissions and energy use associated with existing maintenance activities),
increasing by >1%?;
2) during operation, will roads meet or exceed any of the following criteria?
a) a change of more than 10% in AADT;
b) a change of more than 10% to the number of heavy duty vehicles; and
c) a change in daily average speed of more than 20 km/hr.
3.4
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
3.5
The scoping assessment shall report on life cycle stage or sub-stages for which the GHG emissions
are not likely to be significant.
3.5.1
The scoping assessment should address the following:
1) is there (or is there likely to be, within the timescales of the assessment) sufficient certainty on the
availability of quantitative GHG emissions information?;
2) will the availability of information allow the effects on climate resulting from GHG emissions to be
assessed?
3.6
The scoping assessment shall identify the extent to which operational user GHG emissions are
additional to the baseline in the absence of the project (do-minimum vs do-something), and the GHG
emissions from traffic which are transferring from other roads in the surrounding area.
3.7
Where there is insufficient, reliable information for quantitative assessment for any life cycle stage of
the project, a qualitative assessment of GHG emissions shall be completed in the early stages of
project development.
Study area
3.8
For construction and operational maintenance, the study area shall comprise GHG emissions
associated with project construction related activities/materials and their associated transport.
3.9
For operational road user GHG emissions, the study area shall be consistent with the affected road
network defined in a project's traffic model.
Baseline scenario
3.10
The GHG emissions without the project shall be identified for the current and future baseline
(do-minimum scenarios).
3.10.1
The boundary of the baseline GHG emissions should include current operational maintenance GHG
emissions and operational user GHG emissions.
3.10.2
The baseline GHG emissions should be consistent with the study area outlined for the project.

and design (future) year scenarios.
Significance criteria
3.18
An assessment of project GHG emissions against UK government or Overseeing Organisation carbon
budgets shall be undertaken and presented as follows:
Table 3.18 Project GHG emissions against relevant carbon budgets
Project stage
Estimated total carbon
over carbon budget (tC
O2e)
('Do something'
Scenario)
Net CO2 project GHG
emissions
(tCO2e) (Do something
- Do minimum)
Relevant carbon budget
Construction
Operation
Total
3.19
Where a project stage extends over multiple carbon budget periods, the projects GHG emissions shall
be reported against each carbon budget for each project stage.
NOTE 1
National policy states that "It is very unlikely that the impact of a road project will, in isolation, affect the
ability of Government to meet its carbon reduction plan targets".
NOTE 2
In the context of NOTE 1, it is considered unlikely that projects will in isolation conclude significant
effects on climate.
3.20
The assessment of projects on climate shall only report significant effects where increases in GHG
emissions will have a material impact on the ability of Government to meet its carbon reduction targets.
3.20.1
Where assessment conclusions indicate that there is likely to be a 'material impact' on the
Government's carbon reduction targets, evidence to support this conclusion should be submitted to the
Overseeing Organisation.
3.21
Bench marking of project performance shall be undertaken by comparing GHG emissions to other
highway projects.

3. Assessment methodology
3.21.1
In comparing highways projects, GHG emissions should be normalised to take account of differences in
size and scale.
Design and mitigation
3.22
Projects shall seek to minimise GHG emissions in all cases to contribute to the UK's target for net
reduction in carbon emissions.
3.22.1
Projects should apply and develop the following options:
1) avoid / prevent:
a) maximise potential for re-using and/or refurbishing existing assets to reduce the extent of new
construction required, and/or explore alternative lower carbon options to deliver the project
objectives (i.e. shorter route options with smaller construction footprints);
b) identify through projects and delivery programmes opportunities to influence user GHG
emissions;
2) reduce:
a) apply low carbon and/or reduced resource consumption solutions (including technologies,
materials and products) to minimise resource consumption during the construction, operation,
and at end of life;
3) remediate:
a) identify, assess and integrate measures to further reduce carbon through on or off-site offsetting
or sequestration.
NOTE 1
Minimising GHG emissions through design is a core principle of the Government's Infrastructure
Carbon Review and the Specification on infrastructure carbon management PAS 2080 2016 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
Offsetting and sequestering can include measures such as adoption of renewable energy technologies
or the creation of new habitats or employment of technologies with the capacity to absorb carbon.
3.23
Where carbon offsetting/sequestration is employed to reduce GHG emissions, projects shall agree the
long term viability of the scheme with the Overseeing Organisation.
Vulnerability of projects to climate change
Scoping
3.24
The scoping assessment shall identify whether anticipated changing climate conditions and weather
events are likely to have significant adverse effects on the project (or elements of the project) during
construction and operation.
NOTE 1
Scoping will focus on identification of any likely significant climate changes and likely project exposure
to these changes.
NOTE 2
Scoping will identify vulnerable elements of a project that require further assessment.
Study area
3.25
The study area for assessing a project's vulnerability to climate change shall be based on the
construction footprint/project boundary (including compounds and temporary land take).
Baseline scenario
3.26
The assessment of a project's vulnerability to climate change shall use published historical regional
weather data to demonstrate the current climate impacts on a study area.
NOTE
The Met Office provides information on observed and future climate change relative to the baseline
period of 1961-1990, based on the latest scientific understanding UK CP18 [Ref 3.N].
3.26.1
Recent weather patterns and extreme weather events should be identified, to provide an indication of
how the project will account for climate change in the immediate future i.e. during construction.

3. Assessment methodology
3.27
Historical events as a result of weather patterns and extreme weather events, i.e. landslides after
heavy rainfall, shall be identified to provide an indication of past vulnerability.
3.28
To identify the future changes to the climate baseline, the following factors shall be identified and used
in the assessment:
1) the life span of the project (including timescales for construction and operational life cycle stages);
2) climate trends associated with the UKCP high emissions scenario (50% probability) projection (using
the latest available projections);
3) the environmental baseline under future projected climate conditions.
NOTE
UKCP provides probabilistic projections for the whole of the UK, at regional level and at local level UK
Climate Projections.
3.29
The relevant climate variables shall be identified and included in the assessment.
NOTE
UKCP includes a range of different climate variables (e.g. mean daily temperature for summer and
winter, mean daily maximum temperatures for summer and mean daily minimum temperatures for
winter).
3.30
Assessments shall use the H++ climate scenarios to test the sensitivity of vulnerable safety critical
features, to ensure that such features will not be affected by more radical changes to the climate
beyond that projected in the latest set of UK climate projections.
3.31
The assessment of a project's vulnerability to climate change shall take the life span of the project to be
60 years.
3.32
The life cycle stages being assessed shall determine the relevant period over which the projections are
selected (e.g. short term 2030, medium term 2050, long term 2080), and the extent to which they will
change in comparison to the baseline.
3.33
For projects which are expected to remain in operation beyond the last period of projections, the
assessment shall continue to use the last available period for the remainder of the design life of the
project.
Data collection
3.34
Following identification of the future climate scenarios, the project receptors within the study area which
are vulnerable to climate change shall be identified as below:
1) the construction process (e.g. workforce, plant, machinery etc);
2) the assets and their operation, maintenance and refurbishment (e.g. pavements, structures,
earthworks and drainage, technology assets, etc);
3) end-users (e.g. members of public, commercial operators etc).
3.35
The vulnerability of the project to future climate scenarios shall be identified and reported for each
phase of the project life cycle.
NOTE
Examples of climate change events and associated impacts that can be assessed during construction
and operation are presented in Table 3.35N (not exhaustive).

3. Assessment methodology
Significance criteria
3.36
Where the climate change impact on project receptors is potentially significant, a risk assessment shall
be undertaken.
3.37
The risk assessment shall assess the likelihood and consequence of the impact occurring to each
receptor, leading to evaluation of the significance of the effect.
3.38
The assessment of significance shall be carried out in accordance with the following steps:
1) the identification of hazards and benefits;
2) assessment of likelihood and consequences;
3) evaluation of significance.
3.39
Once the climate change impacts (hazards and opportunities) have been identified, a risk assessment
of those impacts on the operational phase project shall be undertaken using the following framework in
Table 3.39a (likelihood categories) and Table 3.39b (measure of consequence).
Table 3.39a Likelihood categories
Likelihood category
Description (probability and frequency of occurrence)
Very high
The event occurs multiple times during the lifetime of the project (60 years)
e.g. approximately annually, typically 60 events.
High
The event occurs several times during the lifetime of the project (60 years)
e.g. approximately once every five years, typically 12 events.
Medium
The event occurs limited times during the lifetime of the project (60 years)
e.g. approximately once every 15 years, typically 4 events.
Low
The event occurs during the lifetime of the project (60 years) e.g. once in
60 years.
Very low
The event can occur once during the lifetime of the project (60 years).
Table 3.39b Measure of consequence
Consequence of impact
Description
Very large adverse
Operation - national level (or greater) disruption to strategic route(s)
lasting more than 1 week.
Large adverse
Operation - national level disruption to strategic route(s) lasting more
than 1 day but less than 1 week or regional level disruption to strategic
route(s) lasting more than 1 week.
Moderate adverse
Operation - regional level disruption to strategic route(s) lasting more
than 1 day but less than 1 week.
Minor adverse
Operation - regional level disruption to strategic route(s) lasting less
than 1 day.
Negligible
Operation - disruption to an isolated section of a strategic route lasting
less than 1 day.
3.40
For the construction phase, a qualitative description of disruption risk shall be reported.
Evaluation of significance
3.41
The likelihood and consequence of each impact shall be combined in the form of a matrix to identify the
significance of each impact as outlined in table 3.41.

3.43
The environmental assessment shall identify how the project can be adapted to protect it from future
climate scenarios.
NOTE
Early engagement between design engineers and environmental assessment professionals is the most
effective way of eliminating and reducing impacts on the project from climate, thereby reducing the
need for additional / subsequent design and mitigation measures.
3.44
Where an effect has been concluded to be significant, the design and mitigation hierarchy outlined
within LA 104 [Ref 2.N] shall be re-assessed to reduce the significance of impacts to an acceptable
level (not significant).
3.45
Where residual (non-significant) climate impacts have been identified in the environmental assessment,
measures to manage the ongoing risks shall be identified.

Impact of projects on climate
4.1
Quarterly GHG emission returns required on projects during the construction and operation stages
shall be reported in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's requirements.

Actual data provided for the GHG returns shall be evaluated to inform any ongoing monitoring of GHG
emissions and also feed back into future assessment of projects during design development and
planning approval.
Vulnerability of projects to climate change
4.3
Once a project is operational, asset data shall be managed, maintained and monitored to ensure the
project design is operating as intended.
NOTE
Asset management measures can evolve (adaptive management) once the asset is operational as an
appropriate response to climate impacts.
4.3.1
Where a design issue is identified, an assessment should be made to determine if corrective action is
required, i.e. drainage amendments to rectify a flooding hotspot that was not anticipated at design
stage.

Definition
Baseline scenario
The baseline is the level of GHG emissions against which future
GHG emissions are compared.
Boundary
The boundary determines which GHG emissions are accounted
for and reported in relation to the project.
Climate change adaptation
Adapting to current and future impacts of climate change to
reduce the negative impacts and exploit opportunities.
Climate change mitigation
Reducing GHG emissions in order to slow or stop global climate
change.
Direct GHG emissions
These are GHG emissions that originate from sources that are
owned or controlled by the project.
Indirect GHG emissions
Indirect emissions are GHG emissions that are a consequence of
the project, but that occur at sources owned or controlled by
another entity.
GHG emissions
The six main anthropogenic GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur
hexafluoride.
Principles for sustainable land
use
Reflect Scottish Government's policies on the priorities which
should influence land use choices SG/2016/6 [Ref 8.N].
Significant effect
A project is reported as having significant effects on climate where
the assessment identifies increases in carbon emissions that will
have a material impact on the ability of the Scottish Government
to meet its carbon targets.
Tonne of carbon dioxide
equivalent
This refers to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or an amount of
any other greenhouse gas with an equivalent global warming
potential, as calculated in accordance with international carbon
reporting practice.

S/1.
The Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 (Environmental Impact
Assessment) Regulations 2017 (additional to LA 114)
Identification, description and assessment of climate impacts
S/1.1
The significant direct and indirect effects of the construction and operation of the proposed project on
climate (for example the nature and magnitude of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions) shall be identified.
Data collection
S/1.2
A carbon management or measurement tool shall be agreed with Transport Scotland in advance of
data collection.
S/1.2.1
Transport Scotland's Carbon Management System (CMS), which was created to support the use of
data in Transport Scotland project appraisal and design decisions, should be used to ensure that GHG
emissions across a project's life-cycle are assessed in a consistent manner.
NOTE 1
The Transport Scotland Project Carbon Tool, a component of the CMS, can be used to support the
assessment and reporting of GHG emissions across the whole project lifecycle and recommends:
1) a boundary for GHG emissions mapping for road projects, including with regard to embodied carbon
(material resourcing, processing and manufacturing);
2) transport of materials to site, transport of waste; and
3) maintenance activities.
NOTE 2
The CMS:
1) supports the identification and categorisation of emissions in relation to the 'activities' that are
responsible for generating them;
2) is based on established measurement protocols that allow for quantification of climate impacts using
a carbon dioxide equivalent approach; and
3) lists dimensions and assumptions associated with specific elements of road projects.
S/1.3
The climate change principles for sustainable land use introduced in the Land Use Strategy for
Scotland SG/2016/6 [Ref 8.N] shall be applied in the assessment of projects that will have a significant
effect on the use of land.
NOTE 1
The Land Use Strategy SG/2016/6 [Ref 8.N], states that 'land-use decisions can be informed by an
understanding of the opportunities and threats brought about by the changing climate.' Greenhouse
gas emissions associated with land use can be reduced so that land can continue to contribute to
delivering climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives.
NOTE 2
The climate change effects identified in assessments can reflect the potential for decisions that affect
land-use to create an impact, including on natural systems, many miles away.
Significance criteria
S/1.4
Following the assessment of a project's GHG emissions using the criteria in LA 114 [Ref 2.I], the
relevant carbon budget shall be assessed against the emissions envelope's within the Scottish
Government's Climate Change Plan SG RPP3 [Ref 3.N].
NOTE
The Scottish Government's targets identified in the Climate Change Plan were established using the
TIMES model with envelopes calibrated by Scottish specific data and sector intelligence.
Vulnerability of projects to climate change
S/1.5
The Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 (CCRA) ASC (2016) [Ref 9.N] and The UK Climate
Projections (UKCP) UK CP18 [Ref 4.N] shall inform the environmental assessment's assessment of
project vulnerability to climate change in Scotland.

S/1. The Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 (Environmental ...
NOTE 1
CCRA 2017 ASC (2016) [Ref 9.N] describes, and where possible quantifies over 130 impacts from
climate change that Scotland will experience until 2100 and it is updated every five years.
NOTE 2
The UK Climate Projections (UKCP) UK CP18 [Ref 4.N] is an analysis tool designed to help decision
makers assess the risk exposure of a project to climate. The projections are updated on a 9 year basis.
NOTE 3
The (CCRA) 2017 ASC (2016) [Ref 9.N], provides a robust basis for understanding the impacts of
climate change and for adaptation planning.
Design and mitigation
S/1.6
Impacts of climate change to a project shall take into account the Climate Ready Scotland: Scottish
Climate Change Adaptation Programme 2019-2024 SG/2014/83 [Ref 7.N], which sets out policies and
proposals to prepare Scotland for the challenges that we face as our climate continues to change in the
decades ahead.
NOTE 1
The Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme is a requirement of the Climate Change
(Scotland) Act 2009 and addresses the risks set out in the CCRA 2017 ASC (2016) [Ref 9.N],
published under section 56 of the UK Climate Change Act 2008 SI No. 1056 CCA 2008 [Ref 6.N].
NOTE 2
The Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme sets strategic principles that can underpin
approaches to climate change adaptation and related measures, relating to direct and indirect effects of
climate change impacts to road infrastructure .

S/2.
Scottish Government climate change targets (additional to LA 114)
S/2.1
The assessment of projects on climate shall only report substantial effects where increases in GHG
emissions will have a significant impact on the environment and the Scottish Government's ability to
meet its carbon emission targets CCA(S) 2009 [Ref 2.N].
S/2.2
The GHG emission reduction targets set by Scottish Ministers, as mandated by The Climate Change
(Scotland) Act 2009 CCA(S) 2009 [Ref 2.N] shall be taken into account with the respective contributions
towards meeting the GHG reduction targets for the industry sector SG Climate policy [Ref 3.I].
NOTE 1
The significance criteria set out in LA 114 [Ref 2.I] will be used to assess project GHG emissions,
however this will be assessed against Scottish Government sector targets set in the updated Climate
Change Plan SG RPP3 [Ref 3.N] (due to be published).
NOTE 2
The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 CCA(S) 2009 [Ref 2.N], which is the statutory framework for
addressing climate change in Scotland, details a target to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2045
on the baseline (which is either 1990 or 1995 depending on the GHG) in line with that of the UK's
Climate Change Act 2008 SI No. 1056 CCA 2008 [Ref 6.N].
NOTE 3
The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 CCA(S) 2009 [Ref 2.N] employs the unit 'tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent for measurement and calculation of GHG emissions, and reductions thereof, as
calculated in accordance with international carbon reporting practice.
NOTE 4
The Carbon Account for Transport (CAT) TS CAT [Ref 1.I], which is published by Transport Scotland
annually, outlines the contribution of Scotland's transport sector to achieving Scotland's GHG emission
reduction target (it reports on the 'reducing emissions' strategic outcome for Scotland's National
Transport Strategy) and can be used for comparative purposes.
