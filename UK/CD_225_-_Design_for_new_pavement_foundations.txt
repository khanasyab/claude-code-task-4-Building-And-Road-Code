Introduction
Introduction
Background
The main function of a pavement foundation is to distribute the applied vehicle loads to the underlying
subgrade, without causing distress in the foundation layers or in the overlying layers. This is required
both during construction and during the service life of the pavement.
Pavement foundations are designed on the basis of practical minimum layer thicknesses for
construction, protection of the subgrade during construction and long-term provision of support to the
overlying pavement. Other considerations include drainage and durability.
In the short-term during pavement construction, the stresses in the foundation are relatively high. It is
expected that loads are going to be applied to the foundation by delivery vehicles, pavers and other
construction plant. At any level where such loading is applied, the material stiffness and layer thickness
have to be sufficient to withstand the load without damage occurring that might adversely influence, to
any significant extent, the long-term performance.
In the longer-term during the in-service life of a pavement, the stresses in the foundation are expected
to be lower than during construction; although the foundation is going to experience repeated loads
from traffic. It is essential that the assumed support of the foundation to the pavement is maintained,
otherwise, deterioration of the upper pavement layers is going to occur more rapidly than anticipated.
This document sets out the permitted approaches that can be taken when designing a new pavement
foundation. A variety of materials can be utilised in the foundation in the capping and subbase layers.
The designer can take advantage of improved foundation materials by using them to construct stronger
and stiffer foundations that require a reduced thickness of overlying pavement construction (refer to CD
226 [Ref 5.N]).
Three foundation design approaches are presented:
1)
A restricted design approach that offers assurance of performance of the foundation through use
of a limited palette of well understood materials.
2)
A performance design approach that gives flexibility to the designer in terms of the materials that
can be used in the foundation in conjunction with top of foundation testing to confirm performance
requirements have been met.
3)
A widening design approach that utilises a restricted or performance design approach to assure
the performance of the foundation whilst considering the additional requirements to provide
subsurface drainage continuity between the existing pavement and the widening.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 14.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 14.N].

Subgrade assessment and requirements
2.1
The design subgrade surface modulus shall be used in accordance with Section 3, Foundation
designs, of this document.
2.2
The pavement foundation shall be divided into characteristic sections of subgrade, each having a
single design subgrade surface modulus value.
2.2.1
The characteristic sections should be based on type of sub grade material and conditions.
2.3
The short-term subgrade surface modulus and long-term subgrade surface modulus shall be
determined for each characteristic section.
2.3.1
Sampling, testing and classification to determine the soil's properties at the critical moisture conditions
anticipated during construction and over the life of the pavement foundation should be used to estimate
the short-term subgrade surface modulus and long-term subgrade surface modulus.
NOTE
The short-term subgrade surface modulus and long-term subgrade surface modulus are estimated
values.
2.3.2
The process outlined in TRL LR 1132 [Ref 8.I] may be used to review soil properties and construction
assumptions when estimating the short-term subgrade surface modulus and/or long-term sub grade
surface modulus.
NOTE
The presence of a high or perched water table (300 mm or less below formation level) can reduce
subgrade stiffness, culminating in low subgrade surface modulus values at the time of construction.
Guidance on determining subgrade surface modulus values in the presence of a high or perched water
table is given in TRL LR 1132 [Ref 8.I].
2.3.3
Equation 2.3.3 may be used in the estimation of subgrade surface modulus values where the California
bearing ratio (CBR) has been derived from dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) testing.
Equation 2.3.3 CBR to subgrade surface modulus conversion
E = 17.6(CBR)0.64
where:
E
estimated subgrade surface modulus
CBR
California bearing ratio (CBR) of the
subgrade
NOTE 1
Equation 2.3.3 is valid for CBR values in the range 2 to 12 per cent
NOTE 2
Guidance on the application of the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) can be found in CS 229 [Ref 3.I].
NOTE 3
The results obtained from DCP testing will be affected by soil properties including particle size, soil
water content and dry density. However, the slow or negligible rate of penetration of mixed cohesive /
granular materials with large aggregate particles (≥20 mm) can result in an overestimation of subgrade
surface modulus. Further, the water content of granular materials will result in greater variation of the
subgrade surface modulus than implied by DCP penetration rates.
2.3.4
For widening schemes, where the subgrade is consistent across the width of the existing carriageway
and the proposed widening, use of the in situ long-term subgrade surface modulus of the subgrade
below the existing carriageway may be used for design purposes.
2.4
The design subgrade surface modulus shall be determined as being equal to the lower of the
short-term subgrade surface modulus and the long-term subgrade surface modulus values.
2.4.1
For widening schemes, the depth at which the design subgrade surface modulus is determined may be
dependent on any requirements to maintain drainage continuity between the existing carriageway and
the proposed widening.

2. Subgrade assessment and requirements
2.5
The design subgrade surface modulus shall be rounded to a multiple of 5 MPa.
2.6
For each characteristic section of subgrade, the following shall be detailed:
1)
start and end chainage;
2)
short-term subgrade surface modulus (MPa);
3)
long-term subgrade surface modulus (MPa); and,
4)
design subgrade surface modulus (MPa).
2.7
Where the design subgrade surface modulus is lower than 30 MPa, improvement of the subgrade shall
be undertaken.
NOTE
A design subgrade surface modulus value lower than 30 MPa is unsuitable to support the construction
of a pavement foundation.
2.8
Subgrade improvement shall be designed to enable construction of the overlying courses and deliver
in-service performance.
NOTE
Options for improvement of the subgrade include mechanical stabilisation (geogrids and/or geotextiles),
soil stabilisation, and/or excavating and replacing typically between 500 mm to 1500 mm of the
subgrade with granular fill.
2.9
Where subgrade improvement design is for excavation and replacing the material with granular fill, the
design shall include removal of the full depth of the low stiffness material, or otherwise removing
material to the depth of the zone of influence of the pavement.
2.10
The upper limit on design surface modulus for areas of improvement of the subgrade shall be 50 MPa.
Construction subgrade surface modulus testing
2.11
A testing regime shall be detailed to establish the construction subgrade surface modulus.
2.12
The frequency of measurement of subgrade surface modulus shall be detailed where the standard
frequency of 1 test per 60 m is not to be used.
2.13
The frequency of measurement of subgrade surface modulus shall be no more than 1 test per 60 m.
2.14
Where the construction subgrade surface modulus is found to be lower than the design subgrade
surface modulus, then action shall be taken by either:
1)
redesigning the foundation using a revised lower design subgrade surface modulus where the
construction subgrade surface modulus is 30 MPa or higher; or,
2)
improving the subgrade and redesigning the foundation where the construction subgrade surface
modulus is less than 30 MPa.

widening (restricted or performance).
NOTE
Restricted and performance design approaches can be implemented on the same scheme where
different design approaches are appropriate depending on the requirements of specific areas within the
scheme e.g. slip roads versus mainline.
3.4
The design approach shall be determined based on the scheme type, the availability of materials and
economics.
NOTE 1
The restricted foundation design options are based on a limited selection of materials linked to an
assumed performance which does not require verification via performance testing of the foundation.
NOTE 2
Performance foundation designs can offer economic benefits through innovation and/or the use of
materials not permitted within restricted foundation designs. Assurance of material performance is
provided by the performance related specification.
NOTE 3
Foundation designs for carriageway widening can follow either a restricted or performance foundation
design approach with additional measures to ensure drainage paths are not impeded by the widening
of the carriageway.
General requirements for restricted, performance and widening foundation
designs
3.5
For each foundation area, the design approach shall be detailed, i.e. restricted or performance, and
whether it is widening.
3.6
Details of foundation designs shall be recorded in accordance with Section 7 of CD 226 [Ref 5.N].
3.7
The design for all foundation areas shall be based on achieving a foundation class selected from Table
3.7.
Table 3.7 Foundation classes
Foundation class
Assumed long-term confined foundation surface modulus (MPa)
1
≥50
2
≥100
3
≥200
4
≥400
NOTE
Foundation class 4 is not available for the restricted foundation design approach due to a lack of
performance data sets generated since the inclusion of this foundation class in 2006. Therefore,
foundation class 4 is only permitted as a performance foundation.
3.8
The foundation class shall be used in the pavement design in CD 226 [Ref 5.N].
3.9
The design subgrade surface modulus in Section 2 for each characteristic section shall be used in the
foundation design.

3. Foundation designs
3.10
The design thicknesses assume the foundation carries up to 1000 standard axles during construction.
Where higher levels of construction traffic are anticipated (e.g. for a haul road), the design layer
thickness shall be assessed for suitability versus the limiting requirement on vertical strain in the
subgrade (see Section 4).
3.10.1
TRL LR 1132 [Ref 8.I] may be used to establish the subbase thickness required for different levels of
cumulative construction traffic.
3.10.2
Additional subbase thickness may be required for other reasons such as at interfaces, regulation or for
drainage continuity.
Frost susceptible and shrink swell materials
3.11
Materials shall be non-frost susceptible within:
1)
450 mm of the designed final pavement surface, where the MAFI is 50 or greater; or,
2)
350 mm of the designed final pavement surface, where the MAFI is less than 50.
NOTE 1
Frost susceptible soils possess moderate permeability and a fairly high capillarity to enable water to be
drawn up to the ice front. Capillary activity and permeability that permits water migration to be frost
susceptible are associated with silts, silty fine sands and composite soils.
NOTE 2
Information to support determination of the MAFI can be available from the Met Office.
NOTE 3
Further information on the development and calculation of the MAFI is available in TRL RR 45 [Ref 9.I].
3.12
Where frost susceptible materials are encountered within the frost susceptible zone of the pavement,
the design shall include:
1)
replacement with non-frost susceptible material; or,
2)
stabilisation to form a non-frost susceptible material.
3.13
Where shrink swell susceptible materials are encountered in the subgrade that have the potential to
damage the pavement, the design shall include:
1)
replacement with non-shrink swell susceptible material; or,
2)
stabilisation to form a non-shrink swell susceptible material.
NOTE 1
Shrink swell is the volume change that occurs as a result of changes in the water content of clay rich
soils. Swelling pressures can cause heave, or lifting of the pavement structure; whilst shrinkage can
cause differential settlement and cracking.
NOTE 2
Clay rich soil properties that are consistent with the potential for shrink swell include a plasticity index
(PI) of 15 or greater; and more than 10 percent of the soil particles are less than 5 micrometers in size.
NOTE 3
Further information for assessing and reporting the effects of climate change on the asset is available
in LA 114 [Ref 4.N].
Restricted foundation designs
3.14
For each restricted foundation area and for each layer to be constructed, the following shall be detailed:
1)
start and end chainage;
2)
foundation class;
3)
materials to be used; and,
4)
nominal layer thicknesses to be constructed.
Options and restrictions for restricted foundation designs
3.15
Where the short-term subgrade surface modulus is 50 MPa or lower, the foundation design shall
consist of subbase and capping.

3. Foundation designs
NOTE 1
Foundations built on a construction subgrade surface modulus of 50 MPa or less have a high risk of
structural rutting during construction. This can be prevented through subgrade improvement and/or the
use of a capping layer.
NOTE 2
Following subgrade improvement, a capping layer is not necessarily required, dependent on the
estimated short-term subgrade surface modulus value.
3.16
Foundation class 1 shall not be used where the pavement is designed for traffic loading greater than 20
msa.
3.17
Type 2 unbound mixtures shall not be used where pavements are designed for traffic loading greater
than 5 msa.
Capping for restricted foundation designs
3.18
Capping for restricted foundations shall either consist of one class of capping material throughout its
depth laid in one or more layers of compacted thickness, or be formed of not more than two courses of
different capping materials.
3.19
Unbound capping for restricted foundations shall be selected from one or more of the options in Table

foundation class;
3)
the layer stiffness; and,
4)
nominal course thicknesses.
Layer stiffness requirements for performance foundation designs
3.37
Capping layers shall be assigned a layer stiffness for use in the foundation design.
3.38
Subbase layers shall be assigned a layer stiffness for use in the foundation design.
3.39
The layer stiffness assigned to hydraulically bound mixtures for use in the foundation design shall be no
more than 20% of the mixture's mean modulus of elasticity in compression.
Thickness design requirements for performance foundation designs
3.40
The design thickness shall be derived using the layer stiffness values assigned to each layer and the
procedure outlined in Section 4.
3.40.1
When the subgrade surface modulus is expected to be 50 MPa or less at the time of construction, a
capping layer should be added to provide a working platform for construction of the subsequent layers.
NOTE
Foundations built on a construction subgrade surface modulus of 50 MPa or less have a high risk of
structural rutting during construction if the foundation does not incorporate a capping layer.
3.41
The minimum performance foundation design thickness for class 1 and 2 foundations shall be 150 mm.
3.42
The minimum performance foundation design thickness for class 3 foundations shall be 180 mm.
3.43
The minimum performance foundation design thickness for class 4 foundations shall be 200 mm.
3.44
The nominal thickness for each foundation course for performance foundations shall be the derived
design thickness plus an additional thickness based on the:
1)
allowable surface level tolerances in Figure 3.44;

Performance foundation testing
3.45
Where the demonstration area fails to meet the requirements of the performance pavement foundation
testing, for foundation surface modulus and permanent deformation, for that foundation class, then the
materials shall be modified or the foundation redesigned.
NOTE
The foundation surface modulus measured is for a partially confined foundation and is not to be
confused with the long-term confined foundation surface modulus values within Table 3.7.
3.45.1
The foundation redesign may involve increasing foundation thickness and/or changing the materials
used.
3.46
Where the foundation surface modulus is lower than that specified for the designed foundation class,
action shall be taken to either undertake improvement or review the foundation design.
NOTE
The approach for improvement is dependent on the scale of the issue and the practical options
available on site.
3.47
Where a foundation area within the main works fails to conform with the surface modulus performance
measurement requirements, and the foundation is to be redesigned, the suitability of the redesigned
foundation shall be confirmed with a demonstration area.
Widening of pavement foundations
3.48
For widening, the pavement and the foundation of the existing adjacent carriageway shall be assessed
to establish the material type, condition and the thickness of each layer.
NOTE 1
The type, condition, construction thicknesses and levels of the layers in the adjacent pavement and
foundation are key to the design of the widened pavement and foundation.
NOTE 2
This section only details the requirements for the pavement foundations.

2)
layer thicknesses; and/or,
3)
crossfalls.

NOTE
Foamed concrete is unsuitable for narrow widening of pavement foundations at steep gradients or

3.50.3
Where the narrow widening design includes lower strength concrete subbase course and base course,
the courses should be combined as a single layer of the base course lower strength concrete.
3.51
Edge of pavement drains shall be designed in accordance with CD 524 [Ref 6.N].
3.52
Where the existing subsurface drainage falls towards the existing pavement, the formation level within
the widening shall fall in the opposite direction, away from the existing pavement, to avoid additional
water contributing to the existing drainage paths (refer to Figure 3.52, for example).

Procedure for performance foundation designs
4.1
Performance foundation design thicknesses shall be derived analytically using multi-layer linear elastic
analysis.
NOTE
Design charts for a range of layer stiffness and foundation class scenarios are contained within
Appendix A.
4.2
Performance design criteria of subgrade strain and surface deflection shall be as detailed in this
Section.
NOTE 1
Protection of the subgrade during construction (short-term) is based on the vertical compressive strain
in the top of the subgrade. The structural response is limited so that excessive deformation does not
occur.
NOTE 2
Support for the pavement during its design life is defined by calculating the deflection of the foundation
under the action of a wheel load at the top of foundation level, shown in Figure 4.3. The deflection
under a given load can be equated to a surface modulus for the foundation as a whole.
4.3
The vertical strain in the subgrade shall be calculated under the action of a standard 40 kN wheel-load
travelling at the top of foundation level. Refer to Figure 4.3.
Figure 4.3 Input parameters for performance foundation designs
4.4
The vertical strain in the subgrade for the corresponding design subgrade surface modulus value shall
not exceed the limits in Table 4.4.

Unbound capping
5.1
The frequency of plasticity testing shall be detailed for class 6S site won material where the standard
frequency of once per 5000 tonnes of material is not to be used.
5.1.1
A greater testing frequency may be adopted where variability has been identified in the material source
or the material to be used is less than 5000 tonnes.
Bound capping
Feasibility of stabilisation of materials to form bound capping
5.2
Materials to be stabilised to form bound capping shall be assessed for feasibility of stabilisation.
NOTE
Feasibility assessments are undertaken to identify material compatibility with stabilising equipment and
the presence of constituents that can adversely affect performance of the setting, hardening,
performance and volumetric stability of the stabilised material.
5.2.1
Britpave guides BP 51 [Ref 7.I]and BP 62 [Ref 6.I]should be used to determine the potential feasibility
of stabilisation of site won materials through a desktop study to identify the risks associated with
different geologies and inform the ground investigation plan.
NOTE
The feasibility of using site won materials (particularly soils containing organics, sulfates and/or
sulfides) within bound capping is dependent on designing a durable mixture. Experience shows that
initial feasibility assessment is best initiated as part of the site investigation.
5.2.2
Feasibility of stabilisation for site won materials should include establishing the following properties for
the materials:
1)
material type;
2)
range of variation of the material nature and its water content;
3)
plasticity index;
4)
class of the material to be stabilised;
5)
sulfur content;
6)
total potential sulfate content;
7)
organic matter content and type; and,
8)
resistance to water.
NOTE 1
The quality and suitability of imported aggregates to be used to form bound capping is controlled by
requirements in BS EN 13242 [Ref 1.I] and the assessment and verification of constancy of
performance (AVCP) system.
NOTE 2
Laboratory CBR and linear swelling testing can be used to determine the feasibility of stabilisation for
materials with elevated levels of organic matter. Guidance on acceptable limits of organic matter to
produce durable mixtures can be found in Britpave guide BP 62 [Ref 6.I].
NOTE 3
Linear swelling testing can be used to determine feasibility of stabilisation for materials with high
sulfate/sulfide levels. Guidance can be found in Britpave guide BP 51 [Ref 7.I].
5.3
For cohesive materials (Class 7E, 7F and 7I) to form bound capping, a mixture design shall be
undertaken at design stage to demonstrate that the linear swelling category LS5 can be achieved at the
characteristic water soluble (WS) sulfate, oxidisable sulfides (OS), and total potential sulfate (TPS)
content of the material.
5.3.1
The process and guidance provided in Britpave guide BP 51 [Ref 7.I] may be used to derive limits for
WS, OS and TPS.
5.4
Where materials are encountered that contain excessive levels of organic matter, sulfates and/or
sulfides, the foundation shall be redesigned to use alternatives to bound capping.

NOTE
The mixture design and constituent proportions for stabilised materials to form capping is typically
dictated by mixture durability requirements in terms of linear swelling, rather than achieving the
minimum laboratory CBR.
5.7.2
The minimum water content should be the optimum water content, W1,0, or higher.
NOTE
The water content of the stabilised material is better to be slightly on the wet side of optimum than dry.
5.7.3
The maximum MCV should be the MCV at optimum water content, with compaction at a lower MCV to
prevent excessive void content, wetting up and long-term swelling. The MCV at optimum water content
varies between 12 and 14 for various cohesive materials.

5.7.4
The limits of MCV for Class 9D material should be confirmed during the ground investigation. The
upper limit of MCV for Class 9D material has been established as 12 for a wide range of glacial tills and
some over-consolidated clays.
NOTE
MCV of Class 9D material greater than 12 can lead to swelling after compaction.
5.7.5
A minimum MCV of 8 is recommended as a lower limit of acceptability: a soil having an MCV less than
this limit is thus deemed unacceptable i.e. too wet for plant to operate. The limit may be lowered or
raised based on local situation such as the known behaviour of the material and the type of plant used.
5.8
Requirements for measuring the laboratory CBR and linear swelling of stabilised materials to form
bound capping at the construction stage shall be detailed from the following options:
1)
laboratory CBR only;
2)
laboratory CBR and linear swelling; or,
3)
no measurement at construction stage.
5.8.1
Laboratory CBR and linear swell testing should be undertaken during construction to confirm material
suitability where:
1)
the maximum permitted organic matter content is more than 2%; and,
2)

laboratory CBR values.
5.9
Where laboratory CBR of stabilised materials to form bound capping is to be measured at the
construction stage, the testing frequency shall be detailed where different from 1 per lane width per 200
m length.
5.10
Where linear swelling of stabilised materials to form bound capping is to be measured at the
construction stage, the testing frequency shall be detailed where different from 1 per lane width per 200
m length.
Stabilised materials to form bound capping in performance foundations
5.11
Where stabilised materials to form bound capping in performance foundations, the material shall not be
frost-susceptible if it is used within 450 mm of the designed final surface of a road or paved central
reserve, or 350 mm if the mean annual frost index of the site is less than 50.
NOTE
Stabilised materials that form bound capping and conform with linear swelling category LS5 and have a
CBR of 15% or greater are considered to be resistant to frost.
5.12
Where stabilised materials to form bound capping in performance foundations require frost resistance,
the laboratory CBR and linear swelling shall be measured at construction stage to confirm frost
resistance.
5.13
The laboratory CBR for stabilised materials to form bound capping in performance foundations that
require frost resistance shall be the greater of:
1)
the assumed minimum CBR from the foundation design; or,
2)
15%.
5.14
Where stabilised materials are to be used to form bound capping in performance foundations, the
modulus of elasticity in compression (Ec) of the material used in the foundation design shall be detailed.
Compaction of bound capping
5.15
Any areas of bound capping where method compaction is permitted to be used shall be detailed.
5.15.1
Method compaction should only be used for temporary works and where in situ density testing is
impracticable.

The grading category for HBGM subbase is typically a supplier decision based on material availability
and compliance with end product requirements.
NOTE 2
CBGM with a grading category 0/20 or less generally have less risk of segregation versus larger
maximum aggregate sizes.
5.22
The grading category for HBGM subbase other than CBGM 1 shall be as per the requirements in the
relevant part of BS EN 14227-1 [Ref 16.N], BS EN 14227-2 [Ref 13.N], BS EN 14227-3 [Ref 11.N], and
BS EN 14227-4 [Ref 12.N].
Resistance to fragmentation of coarse aggregates in HBGM subbase
5.23
The resistance to fragmentation of coarse aggregates in HBGM subbase shall be selected from the
following categories:
1)
LA50;
2)
LA60; and,
3)
LANR.
NOTE
Category LANR is typically used for HBGM subbase.
Direct trafficking of HBM subbase
5.24

in-situ; and,
2)
ex-situ.
5.28.1
In-situ mixing of HBM may be restricted when the mixing is to be carried out above a substrate that
contains materials that might affect the setting, hardening, strength or stability of the HBM.
Lower strength concrete for subbase
5.29
Where the design includes reinforcement in the lower strength concrete layer, the reinforcement type
shall be detailed.
NOTE
Reinforcement can be included in slabs with an aspect ratio greater than 1.3:1 to limit the formation of
wide, uncontrolled drying shrinkage cracks, which could reduce load transfer, layer stiffness and lead to
reflective cracking.

Appendix A. Example performance foundation design charts
Example design thicknesses using the procedure in Section 4 have been generated at 5-MPa
increments between 30 MPa and 50 MPa and at 10-MPa increments between 50 MPa and 150 MPa,
and have been rounded up to the nearest 10 mm. The graphs are provided for the purposes of
validation of multi-layer linear elastic analysis tools. The layer stiffness values used are a range for
typical mixtures used to achieve the foundation class and are not intended to be limiting values used in
the performance foundation design.

Example 1 – Restricted foundation design procedure
Design factors:
1)
long-term subgrade surface modulus = 35 MPa; and,
2)
short-term subgrade surface modulus = 60 MPa.
Design subgrade surface modulus = 35 MPa.
Using Figure B.1 (replica of Figure 3.27) to design a class 3 restricted subbase only foundation:
A) 240 mm CBGM 1, CBGM 5 or HSS Rc Class 8/10; or,
B) 340 mm CBGM 1, CBGM 5 or HSS Rc Class 3/4.

long-term subgrade surface modulus = 35 MPa;
2)
short-term subgrade surface modulus = 60 MPa; and,
3)
mean modulus of elasticity in compression (Ec) of material = 3500 MPa.
Design subgrade surface modulus = 35 MPa.
For layer stiffness take 20% Ec of material, therefore layer stiffness = 700 MPa.
Using the procedure in Section 4 to design a class 3 performance single layer foundation:
260 mm of 700 MPa subbase

250 mm Type 1, Type 2 or Type 4 unbound mixtures
On
430 mm unbound capping
Formation level of widening lower than adjacent pavement formation so additional thickness not
required.
