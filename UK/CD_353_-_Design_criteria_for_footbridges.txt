2. General principles
2.
General principles
2.1
The design of the bridge shall primarily ensure the safety of its users and those in its environs.
2.1.1
The footbridge and the approach footpaths should facilitate and encourage its use by all the intended
user groups as a means of crossing the obstacle crossed by the structure.
2.2
The selection of alignment, layout, structural form, details and finishes shall be assessed against the
full range of relevant design criteria, including:
1) the type of use;
2) accessibility;
3) safety;
4) aesthetics;
5) environment;
6) environmental impact;
7) cost;
8) robustness;
9) durability;
10) sustainability;
11) buildability; and
12) the ease of operation, inspection and maintenance.
2.3
The design shall take account of all likely users and observers of the bridge, and of the obstacle to be
crossed, before deciding on its location, alignment and form.
2.3.1
The obstacle spanned by the bridge may include a road, railway, and watercourse.
NOTE
For goal-orientated users, an alignment which addresses the main desire line(s) and avoids obstacles
and sharp bends is likely to be a high priority. For recreational users, the design can include features
which add value to the bridge user, such as an alignment or form which reduces exposure to traffic,
enhances new views, creates a new cycle route, or provides occasional resting places. Such features
are part of the overall aesthetic and experience of the bridge.
2.4
The potential risks arising from wilful misuse, vandalism, graffiti, and other types of anti-social
behaviour shall be taken into account in the design.
NOTE
Some bridges attract attempts at vandalism, anti-social behaviour, suicide or self-harm, perhaps due to
their location, seclusion, height or other local characteristics. Where this is perceived to be a potential
problem, consultation with relevant local bodies such as the police, neighbourhood watch, community
groups, local health boards, Samaritans etc. can assist in arriving at appropriate solutions.
Non-engineering solutions are preferred, such as clearing vegetation or removing visual barriers which
reduce visibility. Avoid the use of enclosures, wherever possible, unless they are required for other
reasons.
2.5
Where footbridge materials or components have a potentially high second-hand or scrap value and can
therefore be at risk of theft, the design shall incorporate suitable measures to minimise the risk of their
unauthorised removal.
2.6
Measures that minimise the risk of theft and require the use of special tools or procedures, shall be
designed such that they remain effective throughout their required design life.
2.6.1
Any special maintenance requirements of the measures incorporated for minimising the risk of theft
should be described within the maintenance manual for the structure.

3. Layout and appearance

Layout and appearance
General
3.1
Where a footbridge crosses a dual carriageway carrying traffic with permitted speeds in excess of 30
mph, the bridge shall have a single span crossing both carriageways where possible to avoid the need
for a support in the central reserve.
3.2
Where intermediate piers cannot be avoided, the structural layout, including any vehicle impact
protection around the piers, shall be justified at the concept stage.
3.3
Where any part of a footbridge and its supports is located close to a highway such that an errant
vehicle could cause damage, the design of the footbridge shall include appropriate vehicle impact
protection in accordance with BS EN 1991-1-7 [Ref 6.N] and PD 6688-1-7 [Ref 12.N].
3.4
The design shall follow the advice given in "The Appearance of Bridges and Other Highway Structures"
CD 351 [Ref 16.N] and comply with the requirements of CD 351 [Ref 16.N] in relation to all aspects of
the appearance of the bridge and the experience of its users and observers.
NOTE
Elegant proportions, a logical structural form, visual clarity and attractive details are among the
essential visual characteristics of any good footbridge design, as well as sensitivity to its context and its
environmental and social impact.
3.5
The design shall carefully evaluate the following factors:
1) appearance of the bridge from all angles;
2) views of and from the bridge; and,
3) the experience of the user on the bridge and approaching it.
NOTE
Such factors are particularly important for footbridges because a pedestrian interacts slowly and directly
with the bridge in a way that does not happen for those using a highway bridge in a vehicle for example.
3.6
The design shall minimise the visual and environmental impact of the bridge, access ramps and stairs.
3.6.1
In certain topographies, this requirement may be achieved by visual screening using existing or new
planted hedgerows or tree lines as illustrated in Figure 3.6.1.
Figure 3.6.1 Use of visual screening to minimise visual and environmental impact of
the bridge
3.6.2
The advice of a landscape architect may be sought in relation to any proposed planting.
3.6.3
Planting schemes which create enclosed areas causing potential anxiety or security risk to users, or
which can eventually cause trip or slip hazards from root and branch growth or leaf-fall, should be
avoided.
3.7
The design shall take into account any effects on future maintenance liabilities for the structure.

3. Layout and appearance
3.8
The location and arrangement of the footbridge shall be selected to make maximum use of the local
topography, placing the abutments at or close to adjacent ground level, where possible, so as to
minimise the need for stairs and ramps as illustrated in Figure 3.8.
Figure 3.8 Illustration of maximum use of local topography to minimise the need for
stairs and ramps
3.9
Wherever possible, the design shall make use of natural and man made slopes and topography, such
as cuttings and embankments, to accommodate the access ramps and stairs in order to minimise the
need for them to be supported by additional structural elements.
NOTE
Good and bad footbridge access provisions are illustrated in Figure 3.9N1a and Figure 3.9N1b.

Where the footbridge crosses a road which is in a cutting, particularly when the bridge is visible from a
distance on the skyline, the cutting slope shall extend up to deck level where possible in accordance
with Figure 3.10.
Figure 3.10 Footbridge crossing a road in a cutting
3.11
Where the bridge is to carry an existing rural footpath, bridleway or byway, any diversion of that route
shall be such as to minimise the total route length and maintain the existing desire line so as to make
the path more pleasant, provide better accessibility and help exploit the topography.

3. Layout and appearance
3.11.1
Where it is necessary to divert an existing route, the diversion may need to start a long way from the
bridge to achieve the desired outcomes.
3.11.2
Rural footpaths frequently follow field boundaries and historic rights of way and the layout should avoid
diversions that cut directly across fields.
NOTE
Further guidance on the diversion of existing rights of way can be found in Section 3 of CD 143 [Ref
5.N] "Provision for Non-Motorised Users".
3.11.3
Rural footpaths, bridleways and byways should not be diverted to run beside unscreened, busy roads.
3.11.4
The design should avoid any inaccessible or confined spaces where rubbish and detritus can
accumulate or inspection and maintenance are made difficult.
Access
3.12
Access to the deck of a footbridge shall take account of the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 Acts
2010 c.15 [Ref 5.I].
3.12.1
The provisions of the Equality Act 2010 Acts 2010 c.15 [Ref 5.I] may require access to be provided by
both ramps and stairs.
3.12.2
Where ramps alone provide the most direct route to the deck, the stairs may be omitted.
3.12.3
Access by stairs alone should only be evaluated in exceptional circumstances and with the agreement
of local access and disability groups.
3.13
Access ramps and stairs shall be simple, short and direct wherever possible, following the main desire
line and avoiding long detours or unnecessary climbing.
3.14
The choice of gradients and landings (rest areas), and the radii of turns and manoeuvring spaces, shall
suit the needs of all potential users, including mobility-impaired users, cyclists and equestrians and
particular requirements are given in section 5.
3.15
Where a footbridge crosses a road, the design shall be such as to encourage pedestrians to use the
footbridge rather than to cross the road at grade.
NOTE
Pedestrians can be encouraged to use the footbridge rather than to cross a road at grade by providing
suitable guardrails, fencing or appropriate planting to act as a physical barrier alongside the road.
3.16
Where a footbridge or footway passes close to an adjacent structure or footpath, the design shall
assess the hazard to persons attempting to jump or climb across the gap between the structures.
3.16.1
The design should be such as to prevent or deter attempts to climb between adjacent structures where
such action presents a risk.
3.16.2
Where possible, a gap should be provided between the bridge and the adjacent structure of at least 2
metres.
3.17
Unauthorised access onto the footbridge by motor vehicles shall be prevented, without hindering
access by the intended users of the footbridge, by the use of suitable measures such as bollards or
staggered railings at the ends of the bridge.
3.17.1
Unauthorised access measures should be appropriate to the particular context and environmental
setting.
3.18
Restrictions on footbridges shall be adequately marked in a contrasting colour to assist visually
impaired users.
NOTE
Further information can be obtained from Inclusive Mobility [Ref 4.I].

4. Design standards
4.
Design standards
General
4.1
Steel, concrete, timber and aluminium footbridges shall be designed in accordance with the relevant
parts of the Eurocodes.
4.2
Where other materials are employed, the design shall be in accordance with:
1) an equivalent codified guidance; or,
2) current best practice.
4.3
Where footbridge sub-structures are sited on railway or waterway property, the design shall satisfy the
appropriate authority's requirements.
Vibration and dynamic response
4.4
The design shall meet the vibration serviceability requirements set out in BS EN 1990 [Ref 9.N], NA to
BS EN 1990 [Ref 8.N], BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 7.N], NA to BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 18.N], and PD 6688-2 [Ref
13.N], as implemented by DMRB CD 350 [Ref 17.N].
NOTE
Modern lightweight footbridges can be susceptible to vibrations caused by bridge users, whether
deliberately or unintentionally. Footbridges with vertical modes of vibration less than 5 Hz and/or lateral
modes of vibration less than 2.5 Hz can be particularly susceptible, and the resulting motions can
cause discomfort to bridge users and even lead to structural damage in extreme cases.
4.5
Accelerations shall be calculated for lateral and torsional modes of vibration with natural frequencies of
less than 2.5Hz in response to single pedestrian (and small pedestrian groups) when walking and
jogging and to crowded conditions.
NOTE 1
A methodology for the determination of dynamic lateral responses arising from pedestrians is given in
Appendix A.
NOTE 2
The methods in Appendix A are additional to the provisions of BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 7.N], its National
Annex NA to BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 18.N], and PD 6688-2 [Ref 13.N], as implemented by DMRB CD 350
[Ref 17.N].
NOTE 3
The dynamic response of footbridge structures is a relatively specialist area of work. Obtain specialist
advice where necessary to derive an appropriate prediction of the structural response and pedestrian
comfort.
4.6
Where dampers are required to control vibration amplitudes, they shall be robust, durable, accessible
for routine inspection but not to anyone other than authorised inspectors, and designed for easy
maintenance.
NOTE
Obtain specialist advice where necessary to determine the most appropriate damper to suit the
application.
Minimum thickness of metal sections
4.7
The minimum thickness of metal structural elements shall be as defined in table 4.7.

5. Dimensional standards
5.
Dimensional standards
Clearances to highway beneath the bridge
5.1
The vertical clearances to a highway beneath the bridge shall be in accordance with CD 127 [Ref 2.N].
5.1.1
The vertical and horizontal clearances to railways, canals and watercourses should be agreed with the
Technical Approval Authority.
5.2
The horizontal clearance from the edge of the carriageway to the footbridge supports shall be a
minimum of 4.5 metres over the full height of the carriageway clearance envelope.
5.3
Where there is a possibility that the hard shoulder can be used as a running lane in the future, the
design shall account for any specific allowances which have to be made for this.
Minimum width
5.4
The minimum clear width of the footway, ramps and stairs shall be the greater of 2.0 metres or the
dimension determined from the following in relation to predicted peak pedestrian traffic:
1) on the level or where the gradient is 1:20 or shallower: 300 mm of width per 20 persons per minute;
2) on steps, or where the gradient is 1:15 or steeper: 300 mm of width per 14 persons per minute; or,
3) for gradients between 1:15 and 1:20, a dimension derived by linear interpolation between 1 and 2.
5.5
Where the footbridge is for shared use by cyclists or equestrians, the design shall also comply with the
requirements of section 11.
Headroom clearance on the bridge
5.6
The minimum headroom to the underside of overhead obstacles such as stay cables, roof enclosures
or other overhead features, measured vertically from the footway surface across the full width between
handrails, shall be in accordance with Table 5.6.

Laminated and toughened glass panels should retain sufficient post fracture strength to remain in place
within its fixings when they are damaged such that shards created during shattering are retained by the
laminated materials.
6.8
A risk assessment shall be undertaken during the selection of the glazing system.
6.8.1
Where a footbridge is exposed to particularly strong winds (such as where it is unusually high above
the surrounding ground level), the height of the parapet may be increased to 1.30m with a solid or
partially solid infill panel to provide extra protection to users.
6.8.2
As an alternative to raising the height of the parapet an enclosed form of superstructure may be
evaluated in order to provide enhance user protection against strong winds.
NOTE
Advice on enclosed footbridges is provided in Section 7 of this document.
6.8.3
Where parts of the footbridge, ramps or stairs pass close to buildings, the design should incorporate
solid parapet infill panels or suitable screening to protect the privacy of bridge users, adjacent residents
and others where necessary.
6.9
Where structural members of a footbridge serve as a parapet, the height of the parapet, the infilling of
open areas, the upstand at the edge of the walkway surface and the climbability of any part shall be in
accordance with the requirements for parapets.

7. Enclosed footbridges
7.
Enclosed footbridges
7.1
Footbridges shall be designed with full or partial enclosure where it is assessed that there is a
particularly high risk of the following:
1) objects being dropped or thrown from the footbridge; or
2) persons jumping onto the carriageway from the footbridge.
7.1.1
Depending on the issues relevant at a particular site, a high parapet with an inward canted top may
suffice in place of full enclosure.
7.1.2
Where a footbridge is exposed to very adverse weather or strong winds, such as where it is unusually
high above the surrounding ground level, or where it is so high above the road that pedestrians can feel
insecure, then full or partial enclosure may be required.
7.2
Where full or partial bridge enclosure is proposed, the aerodynamic and other effects of wind both on
the structure and on the comfort of its users shall be investigated and analysed.
7.2.1
Specialist advice may be necessary to assess the aerodynamic and other effects of wind on the
structure and comfort of its users.
7.3
Wind tunnel testing shall be considered where reliable design guidance is not available for the form of
bridge design.
NOTE
Guidance for wind tunnel testing is given in CD 363 [Ref 4.N].
7.4
Cladding and infill panels shall be suitable for their use and location, with a robustness and durability
appropriate for the intended lifespan of the footbridge.
7.4.1
Panels (perforated or otherwise) can be of any suitable material, but solid panels which are above the
handrail should be transparent, unless otherwise required such as in the case of some equestrian
bridges.
7.5
Where cleaning of the outside surfaces of the enclosure is required, the design shall enable this to be
carried out in a safe manner.
7.6
The design shall prevent unauthorised public access to the outside of the enclosure.
NOTE 1
Particular care is needed to prevent access to the outside at the ends of the bridge where it is over a
cutting.
NOTE 2
Flush glazing on the outside face of the structure is an acceptable form for enclosure of the walls, and
arched mesh roofs are an acceptable form for preventing roof access. Other solutions are also
possible.
7.7
The minimum clearance inside the enclosure shall comply with Section 5.

8. Drainage
8.
Drainage
8.1
Provision shall be made for the drainage of water from the footbridge, and from its roof in the case of
enclosed footbridges.
8.2
All walkway surfaces, steps, ramps and roof shall have sufficient falls and suitable detailing to allow
water to run off in the manner intended by the design.
8.3
With the exception of stair treads and structures with perforated decks, water from the footbridge shall
be carried away to a:
1) drainage system; or,
2) soakaway.
8.4
Drainage outlets shall project a suitable distance beyond the adjacent structure to prevent water
splashing onto the structure.
NOTE
These requirements are to prevent discharge or spill onto the carriageway or footpaths below the
bridge, or staining of adjacent exposed surfaces.
8.5
Positive drainage shall be provided beneath all deck movement joints, with water being directed away
from bearings and bearing shelves.
8.6
Steel decks shall be carefully detailed to ensure the fabrication process does not induce distortions
caused by weld shrinkage which could lead to water ponding on the deck.
NOTE
Measures that can be considered to avoid deck distortions include the use of 8mm deck plate spanning
no more than 800mm. The deck plate can be cambered to provide a transverse cross fall to the edges
of the deck to ensure surface water is shed to the sides and directed to a positive drainage system.
8.7
The longitudinal profile of the bridge shall be designed with precamber to overcome self-weight and live
action deflections whilst maintaining a positive fall to drainage outlets.
8.7.1
The precamber should be sufficient to ensure positive fall to the drains under SLS load conditions
including snow loading.
8.8
The design shall ensure that drainage paths and deck camber profiles at landings prevent the
possibility of ponding (particularly at corners where the landing is used to allow a change in direction).
8.9
Where a flight of stairs is included within the structure the drainage paths shall be detailed to prevent
water ponding at the top and bottom of stair landings and prevent the possibility of water discharging
down the steps from adjacent ramps.
8.10
Steps and nosings shall be detailed to prevent water getting trapped on the step (for example due to a
nonslip nosing upstand or back fall on the step occurring due to inadequate construction tolerance).
8.11
Where there is a risk of leaf debris falling onto the deck, and also at the base of long ramps, the use of
proprietary channel drains with gratings covers shall be avoided.
NOTE 1
The slots can be become blocked with debris resulting in the drainage becoming ineffective.
NOTE 2
On long ramps or steep gradients a large percentage of water can run over the top of any grating.
8.12
The possibility of water running over the top of any grating system shall be assessed in any drainage
design.
8.12.1
A drainage system should, where possible, be provided off the structure upstream of the deck or
expansion joint to capture and prevent surplus surface water from reaching the structure from adjacent
paved surfaces.
8.13
Erosion protection at drainage discharge points shall be provided to prevent damage to structure
foundations and adjacent soft surfaced areas.
8.14
When designing a drainage system, the provision of access shall be evaluated to allow safe
periodic/routine maintenance operations to be undertaken.

Walkway surface
9.1
The fitness for purpose and choice of the combined substrate/surfacing system for the respective user
type shall be:
1) assessed in accordance with the requirements in this section; and,
2) agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
9.2
The nature of the walkway surfacing system represents a vital part of the overall appearance,
character, performance and durability of the bridge, and shall be assessed as an integral part of the
design to suit the particular application.
9.3
The suitability of the surfacing system shall be assessed in line with all performance requirements such
as corrosion resistance, slip resistance, environmental deterioration, noise transmission, free drainage
and durability.
9.3.1
Noise attenuation may be required in some cases, such as on equestrian bridges close to sensitive
noise receivers.
NOTE
Proper adhesion of surfacing materials with all parts of the structure is necessary, including with
painted elements, ducts, etc.
9.4
The upper substrate surface of bridge decks, ramps and stairs shall be waterproofed or otherwise
protected against deterioration due to water or surface contaminants.
9.5
All traversed surfaces shall be designed to have minimum slip resistance for the life of the walkway
surfacing equivalent to a mean corrected pendulum test value of 45 units using a standard skid
resistance pendulum test in accordance with BS EN 13036-4 [Ref 15.N].
9.6
Cover plates to expansion joints at deck level shall be flush with the walkway surface and provided with
a suitable slip resistant coating or be profiled to provide a non-slip finish.
9.7
The width of any exposed gap in the walkway surface, such as at movement joints, shall not exceed
12mm, taking into account movements due to temperature.
9.8
Where the bridge is designated for use by cyclists, any gap, joint or discontinuity in the bridge deck
surface that is aligned within a plan angle of less than 30o to the normal line of travel shall be flush with
the surface and such that a bicycle wheel cannot be caught or deflected when it passes over.
NOTE
Gaps, joints and discontinuities include the edges of manhole covers, for example.
9.9
The installation date and minimum expected life of the surfacing and waterproofing system shall be
given in the maintenance manual for the structure.

10.
Lighting
10.1
Footbridges shall be illuminated where they are located in areas where public lighting is provided.
10.2
Lighting shall conform to the requirements of BS 5489-1 [Ref 2.I].
10.3
The design shall take into account not only the level and nature of illumination necessary for safety
reasons, but also the visual impact and aesthetic character of the lighting scheme when viewed both by
users of the bridge and those passing or living nearby.
NOTE 1
Footbridge lighting, where required, is an important aspect of the design and can be a highly significant
visual feature during hours of darkness. Refer to the recommendations of CD 351 [Ref 16.N] in respect
of the appearance of the bridge at night.
NOTE 2
Lighting design is a specialist field, and in certain cases the input of a specialist lighting designer is
needed to achieve the quality of lighting demanded by the bridge and its environment.
10.4
The design shall avoid unnecessarily excessive illumination, and in particularly any direct glare in the
eyes of bridge users, drivers passing beneath or other observers.
10.5
Where illumination is provided on the bridge, it shall be consistent to ensure that all walkway surfaces,
stairs and handrails are visible.
10.6
Footbridge lighting shall be on a circuit that can be isolated.
10.6.1
Footbridges may be illuminated by means of existing adjacent road or footway lighting, augmented
where necessary by additional ground level mounted lighting columns and lanterns.
10.6.2
Where it is not possible or appropriate to illuminate a footbridge by means of existing lighting from the
adjacent road or footway, the footbridge may be illuminated by:
1) light fittings incorporated into the parapet or handrail; or,
2) other light fittings mounted on the bridge.
NOTE
A covered walkway cannot be lit from existing lighting from the adjacent road or footway.
10.7
All components of the lighting system, including all fittings, connections, wiring and switchgear, shall be
robust and tamper proof.

11. Combined use footbridges
11.10.3
Features for slowing should encourage cyclists to slow down without forcing them to dismount.
11.10.4
Unless there is an immediate justification for using barriers or chicanes, they should be omitted.
11.11
The geometry of the bridge approaches shall be such that installation of barriers and chicanes at a later
date is possible.
NOTE
Further requirements and advice regarding designing for cycle traffic can be obtained in accordance
with CD 195 [Ref 3.I].
Combined use by pedestrians and equestrians
11.12
Where a bridge is designated for equestrian use, it shall be designed in accordance with the relevant
parts of the Eurocodes as implemented by DMRB CD 350 [Ref 17.N].
11.12.1
All bridges catering for equestrians should be designed for combined pedestrian/equestrian use, and
can very often be required to accommodate cyclists too.
11.13
The minimum width of a footbridge for combined pedestrian/equestrian use shall be 3.5 metres.
11.13.1
Where a large number of horses are expected to cross the bridge at the same time (such as where the
bridge is adjacent to a riding school or stables, for example) a larger width may be required.
11.13.2
In some cases of very frequent use by equestrians as well as pedestrians and/or cyclists it may be
necessary to provide suitable physical segregation.
11.14
Where the headroom on the bridge does not conform to the requirements of section 5, suitable signs
shall be provided requiring equestrians to dismount.
11.15
The design shall incorporate mounting/dismounting blocks in the approaches to the bridge to assist
those who prefer to lead their horse across the bridge.
11.16
Mounting blocks shall not reduce the clear width required for combined pedestrian/equestrian use.
11.16.1
Where mounting blocks are intended they should be located such that the passage of users, including
prams and wheelchairs or mobility and visually impaired users is not restricted.
11.16.2
Mounting/dismounting blocks are intended for the convenience of equestrians and may also be
provided where the crossing is not part of a designated bridleway.
11.17
Where solid infill panels higher than the minimum height required by section 6 are used in order to
reduce the risk of horses being startled by traffic on the carriageway below, the design shall assess the
effects on bridge appearance and the potential loss of utility to other users.
11.18
Wherever possible, the design shall provide suitable equestrian waiting areas off the bridge, and permit
all users approaching the bridge to see the entire length of the structure, so as to allow mounted users
the option of crossing when the deck is clear.
11.19
Suitable signs shall be erected on the approaches to the footbridge to warn other users of the likely
presence of horses, and requesting cyclists to take particular care or give way to equestrians.
11.20
On designated bridleways, where the deck is constructed of steel, timber or any other material which
can resonate with the sound of horses' hooves and potentially alarm them, a noise attenuating
surfacing system shall be used.
11.20.1
On non-designated bridleway bridges, warning signs may be installed to alert equestrian users of
sound resonance from the impact of the horses' hooves with the surfacing of the deck.
11.20.2
Such surfacing systems may include dense rubber paving blocks for example.

Appendix A. Pedestrian induced dynamic response
A1
Lateral response calculations
Peak lateral deck accelerations induced by pedestrians should be calculated by following the approach
described in NA to BS EN 1991-2 [Ref 18.N] and PD 6688-2 [Ref 13.N], but with certain parameters
modified to relate to lateral response, rather than vertical.
A1.1
Direction of loading
Lateral dynamic loads due to pedestrians should be taken to be in the horizontal plane, orthogonal to
the longitudinal axis of the bridge deck.
A1.2
Reference load
The reference load for use in lateral response calculations is F0 = 70N, for both the walking and jogging
cases.
A1.3
Combined population and harmonic factor
Figure A.1 Combined population and harmonic factor for use in lateral response
calculations
The combined population and harmonic factor k(fv), as obtained from figure NA.8 in NA to BS EN
1991-2 [Ref 18.N] for vertical response calculations, should be substituted for a similar parameter k'(fv,la
t), where fv,lat is the natural frequency of the lateral deck mode being considered. k'(fv,lat) to be obtained
from figure A.1.

Lateral deck acceleration limits
Peak lateral deck accelerations, calculated according to the method described in this appendix, should
be compared against the limit recommended in BS EN 1990 [Ref 9.N].
Measures to provide damping should be introduced if the accelerations are above the recommended
limits.
