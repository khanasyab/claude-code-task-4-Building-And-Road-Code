Introduction
Introduction
Background
The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) is a suite of documents which contains
requirements and advice relating to works on motorway and all-purpose trunk roads for which one of
the Overseeing Organisations is highway or road authority.
The DMRB embodies the collective experience of the Overseeing Organisations, their agents, supply
chain members and industry bodies. It provides requirements and advice resulting from research,
practical experience of constructing and operating motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, and from
delivering compliance to legislative requirements.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the DMRB
Competence
The DMRB has been prepared for use by competent practitioners, typically qualified professionals able
to work independently in relevant fields, who are expected to apply their own skill and judgement when
making decisions involving the information that the DMRB contains.
Link with regulation and legislation
DMRB documents are not statutory or regulatory documents or training manuals; neither do they cover
every point in exhaustive detail.
In general, the DMRB does not duplicate National, UK and European legislative requirements. Anyone
engaged in works on or relating to the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk
roads is assumed to understand and comply with the relevant legislation.
Link with the MCHW
The requirements and advice given in DMRB documents are provided on the basis that the works are
constructed in accordance with the Manual of Contract Documents for Highway Works (MCHW).
Verbal forms
The verb 'must' indicates a statutory or legislative requirement.
Note: Requirements with this verb form cannot be varied.
The verb 'shall' indicates a requirement of the Overseeing Organisation.
Note: Requirements with this verb form can be only be varied though the use of departures or in limited
situations as relaxations.
The verb 'should' indicates advice expressed as a recommendation.
Note: Recommendations with this verb form are good practice and can be varied without recourse to
the departures process, but require justification and a safety risk assessment where the
recommendation is not followed.
The verb 'may' indicates advice expressed as a permissible approach.
Note: Permissible approaches with this verb form can be varied in accordance with internal review
processes without recourse to the Overseeing Organisation.
The verb 'can' or verbs expressed in the present tense other than 'must', 'shall', 'should' and 'may' are
used to introduce notes, which provide a short clarification of a concept or statement of fact.
Appendix A provides information about the document referencing used within DMRB documents.
Appendix B provides information about the clause numbering system used within DMRB documents.

Introduction
Mutual recognition
Where there is a requirement in the DMRB for compliance with any part of a British Standard or other
technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with:
1) a standard or code of practice of a national standards body or equivalent body of any EEA state or
Turkey;
2) any international standard recognised for use as a standard or code of practice by any EEA state or
Turkey;
3) a technical specification recognised for use as a standard by a public authority of any EEA state or
Turkey; or
4) a European Technical Assessment issued in accordance with the procedure set out in regulation
(EU) No. 305/2011;
provided that the relevant standard enables an equivalent level of performance and safety to be
achieved to that provided for by the stated British Standard or technical specification.

4) where appropriate, assets on land leased by the Overseeing Organisation for which the Overseeing
Organisation is responsible.
NOTE 1
Overseeing Organisation land can be near to the motorway or all-purpose trunk road network, for
example, land containing a maintenance vehicle access roads (which are not public highway), service
and rest areas, or drainage balancing ponds remote from the highway.
NOTE 2
Overseeing Organisation assets remote from the motorway or all-purpose trunk road network, can
include depots, warehouse buildings, or office buildings.
1.2.1
Requirements may be applied to other roads with the approval of the specific highway or local authority
acting as the Overseeing Organisation.
1.2.2
Where these requirements are applied to other roads, the specific highway or local road authority
acting as the Overseeing Organisation should decide on the extent to which the requirements are
appropriate in any given situation.
Implementation
1.3
Individual documents shall be implemented in accordance with any implementation requirements in a
particular DMRB document.
NOTE
Failure to implement a document that addresses statutory or legislative obligations can place the
Overseeing Organisation at risk of legal action or consequence.
1.4
Where there are no specific implementation requirements in a particular DMRB document, the
document shall be implemented immediately after publication except:
1) where the contract has reached a stage that, in the opinion of the Overseeing Organisation, use of a
new or revised document would result in significant additional expense or delay; or,
2) where an existing contract has terms which apply specifically to the implementation of new
requirements.
1.5
Where the contract has reached a stage that, in the opinion of the Overseeing Organisation, use of a
new or revised document would result in significant additional expense or delay, the decision whether
to use a new or revised document shall be recorded in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's
procedure.
1.6
Where the role of Overseeing Organisation has been delegated, the delegated authority shall assume
the risks, responsibilities and duties of the Overseeing Organisation to the extent defined by the
contract and permitted under National, UK and EU Legislation.

2. Application of the DMRB
2.
Application of the DMRB
2.1
All works, including inspections on motorway and all-purpose trunk roads, on land owned, leased or
managed by the Overseeing Organisation shall be undertaken in accordance with DMRB requirements
appropriate to the intended use of the asset or road.
NOTE
The requirements appropriate to the new use or status of an asset or road are applied where there is a
change in use or status. For example, the change in use or status can be improving a road to remove
lower mandatory speed limits, or the upgrading of an all-purpose trunk road to motorway.
2.1.1
Where the road is to be reduced in status, e.g. de-trunked or where the works are to be carried out on
roads that are not part of the trunk road network and the use of the DMRB could result in significant
over-specification, alternative documents such as the Manual for Streets [Ref 3.I] or Designing Streets
2010 [Ref 2.I] may be used with the approval of the Overseeing Organisation.
National Application Annexes of the Overseeing Organisations
2.2
National Application Annexes (NAA) shall be used where they exist.
NOTE 1
NAAs allow Overseeing Organisations to complement, supplement or replace the requirements and
advice contained in the main DMRB document.
NOTE 2
Other highway authorities or local authorities can develop their own application annexes to
complement, supplement or replace the requirements and advice contained in the main DMRB
document.
Departures from requirements
Scope
2.3
Statutory and legislative requirements must always be followed.
NOTE
Departures are not applicable to statutory and legislative requirements.
2.4
Where requirements of the Overseeing Organisation are not met, a departure application shall be
submitted in accordance with the procedures required by the relevant Overseeing Organisation and
approved:
1) before the design is finalised; and,
2) prior to their incorporation into the works.
2.4.1
Where requirements of the Overseeing Organisation are not met, departures should be submitted
where:
1) it can be justified that a requirement is inappropriate in a particular situation;
2) the application of a requirement would have unintended adverse consequences;
3) innovative methods or materials are to be proposed;
4) a requirement not in the DMRB, NAA or MCHW is adopted as more appropriate in a particular
situation; or,
5) an aspect not covered by requirements is identified.
NOTE
Departure applications are approved on a location-specific basis and relate to the particular
circumstances identified in each submission; however, an approved departure can be quoted to
support a new and similar submission.
2.4.2
Bulk departure applications should be submitted in preference to a number of individual departures,
where the individual departures share common methods or materials.
2.5
Each departure application shall be approved in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's
procedures before the design is finalised and prior to its incorporation into the works.

GG 101 Version 0.1.0
2. Application of the DMRB
NOTE
An approved departure is deemed to meet the Overseeing Organisation's requirements for that
element of the works, provided that any mitigation measures proposed or conditional to that approval
are also incorporated into the design and works.
Interactions with local roads
2.6
Where works that will subsequently be adopted by a local highway/road authority are to be carried out
by an Overseeing Organisation, any departure applications shall be submitted in accordance with the
Overseeing Organisation's requirements for departures.
Departure applications for aspect not covered by requirements
2.7
Where an aspect of the works is not covered by existing requirements, a departure application for an
aspect not covered by requirements shall be submitted.
2.7.1
Where an aspect of the works is not covered by existing requirements, the principles of current and
relevant guidance should be followed.
Non-compliance with requirements
2.8
Where it is discovered that works have been undertaken that are not in accordance with the
requirements of the DMRB or the requirements of a departure, the party responsible for undertaking
such works shall amend the works to rectify the non-compliance.
Relaxations
2.9
Relaxations shall only be applied where they are explicitly permitted in a DMRB, NAA or MCHW
document and in accordance with the instructions in that document.
2.10
Adoption of a relaxation and its reasoning shall be recorded by the design organisation.
2.11
A departure application shall be submitted for any proposed variation beyond the limits permitted by a
relaxation.
Deviation from recommendations
Justification
2.12
A justification shall be developed to support any decision where a recommendation (verb form - should)
contained in the DMRB and related NAAs is not followed.
2.13
Justifications to support all design decisions shall be recorded by the design organisation as part of the
project record.
2.13.1
The justification should include a comparison of costs / time / resources of the proposed solution to the
recommended approach.
2.13.2
Where the decision is made for non-commercial or non-programme (i.e. sustainability, environmental,
historical, cultural or aesthetic) reasons, the reasons and their justification should be included.
2.13.3
The justification for deviating from a recommendation may be produced for a single project or
alternatively for multiple projects on a scheme, where relevant.
2.13.4
Where the justification for deviating from a recommendation is covered within documents already
required by other standards/processes, a reference to the relevant, alternative source may be included
in lieu of a detailed description.
NOTE
Examples of other relevant formal procedures are the technical approval process and environmental
assessments.
2.14
Any deviation from a recommendation along with the supporting justification shall be available to the
Overseeing Organisation as required.

Appendix B. Clause numbering system in DMRB documents
The numbering system presented in Table B.1 is used in DMRB documents to make a clear distinction
between requirements and advice.

Format
Number format
Example
X. Section
1-level number
6. Key Stage 1: Initial review of
project
Sub-headings(s)
No number
General features
X.X Requirement
2-level number
6.1 The format of the statement of
intent given in Appendix B shall be
used.
NOTE: Clarification of concept or
statement of fact
No number but
associated with
requirement
NOTE: The statement of intent is
typically a brief document.
X.X.X Advice
(recommended or permissible
method for fulfilling requirement)
3-level number
6.1.1. The statement of intent should
form part of any commissioning report.
6.1.1 The statement of intent may
form part of any commissioning report.
NOTE: Clarification of concept or
statement of fact
No number but
associated with advice
NOTE For many projects the
statement of intent takes the form of a
letter.
Sections are the highest level of subdivision and have a numbered heading, i.e. 1-level number.
Sub-headings are provided to group linked requirements under a specific section and are not
numbered.
Requirements are numbered sequentially with a primary 2-level system of numbering, i.e. 5.2, 7.3, etc.
Advice is always associated to a specific requirement and is numbered sequentially with a secondary
3-level system of numbering e.g. 5.2.1, 7.3.1 etc.
Notes provide information assisting users in understanding and contextualising a specific requirement
or advice. They are placed immediately after the requirement or advice which they refer to and do not
require numbering, unless more than one note applies to the same clause. In such a case, the
numbering is NOTE 1, NOTE 2 etc.
