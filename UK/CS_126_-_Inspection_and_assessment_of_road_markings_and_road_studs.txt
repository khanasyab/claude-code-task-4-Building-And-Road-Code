Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets requirements for inspection regimes to be carried out for road markings and
retroreflecting road studs, (including light emitting (active) road studs), on motorways and all-purpose
trunk roads as agreed by the relevant Overseeing Organisation. These are necessary because:
1) if there is a failure in the performance of road markings and retro-reflecting road studs, this affects
their legal status or that of an associated statutory provision;
2) proliferation of road markings can have a detrimental effect on the visual environment and
comprehension by the road user;
3) the visual performance of road markings degrades over time, reducing conspicuity and legibility;
4) road safety can be affected by the reduction in the visibility and legibility of road markings;
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 3.N] apply to this document.
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a "British Standard" or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the Mutual Recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 3.N].
Non-reflecting road studs and those incorporating active elements are not within the scope of BS EN
1463-1 [Ref 7.N] and require type approval to comply with the SI 2016 No.362 (TSRGD) [Ref 10.N]. SA
1 in the MCHW SA 1 [Ref 4.N] lists road stud products which have been type approved for use in the
UK.

this is termed as an "Agreement".
Critical area
Critical areas of the network refer to those areas of the network that
can pose a risk to the road user if badly worn.
Critical defect
A defect that requires prompt attention because it represents an
immediate or imminent hazard, or there is a breach of statutory
duty, including where markings are not prescribed in regulations
nor authorised by the relevant Secretary of State.
NOTE: These have previously been referred to as a Category 1 (or
Category I) defect. See Section 4 for required action.
Functional life
The period during which the road marking fulfils all the
performance requirements initially specified. The life is influenced
by thickness of the laid materials, the type of materials and the
nature of location, including the traffic. This is either the number of
roll overs identified on the product test certificate to BS EN 1824
[Ref 8.N] or as identified by the markings manufacturer.
Luminance
The property of the marking which describes the brightness of its
colour, measured as either the luminance co-efficient (Qd) or
luminance factor (β), as described in detail in BS EN 1436 [Ref
9.N].
Luminance co-efficient (Qd)
Luminance co-efficient under diffuse illumination is the quotient of
the luminance of a field of the road marking in a given direction by
the illuminance on the field (unit: mcd/m2/lx).
Non-critical defect
A defect that requires replacement within a pre-defined period in
line with agreements reached with the Overseeing Organisation.
This has previously been referred to as a Category 2 (or Category
II) defect. See Section 4 for required action.
Retroreflectivity
The ability of a road marking to reflect light from a vehicle's
headlights back to the driving position of a vehicle.
Skid resistance
Measurement on road markings carried out using the standard
British pendulum apparatus. BS EN 1436 [Ref 9.N] specifies skid
resistance classes.

Inspection frequencies
General
2.1
Inspection regimes shall follow a risk based approach where available data permits its adoption.
NOTE
For routes with available, accurate asset data, a cyclical approach to renewals can assist with reducing
the cost and inconvenience of formal surveys.
2.2
Where available data does not permit the adoption of a risk based approach, a fixed frequency for
inspections shall be used in accordance with the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.3
The reasons for the selected approach shall be documented and retrievable, in accordance with the
requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.4
The format and content of risk assessments to support a risk based inspection approach shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
Frequency of inspections
2.5
Inspections of road markings and retroreflecting road studs shall be undertaken periodically so that the
requirements of this document can be met.
NOTE
Further guidance on the methodology that can be employed in order to determine inspection
frequencies is provided in Appendix A.
2.5.1
Targeted inspections should be carried out in response to reports of extreme conditions that have the
potential to increase the risk of asset damage.
NOTE
For example, a major road traffic accident or extreme weather.
Street lighting changes
2.6
Proposals to dim street lighting, or turn off street lighting (fully or partially) either via a trial or
permanently, shall be supported by a current assessment (less than 6 months) of condition of road
markings and road studs.
Road markings
2.7
The selected time period for the first formal inspection shall be determined by the claimed functional life.
2.7.1
The time period may be increased or decreased depending on:
1) the characteristics of the site;
2) the product genre and actual product used; and
3) assurance of the quality of installation, including the thickness of any in-situ markings and the road
surface condition.
2.8
Evidence to support the choice of timing of the first formal inspection shall be recorded in accordance
with the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.9
Where a risk based inspection regime is used, the rate of deterioration of a representative sample of
road markings shall be measured in order to provide a knowledge base and further evidence of risk to
assist in determining the future of:
1) inspection frequencies;
2) routine renewals of road markings.
2.10
Different classes of road have different accident rates and those with poorer accident performance, or
individual roads historically performing worse than expected, shall attract a higher level of importance
when determining risk profiles.

2. Inspection frequencies
Characteristics requiring inspection
2.11
An inspection regime shall be devised to determine if any of the following characteristics are to be
inspected, the priorities and how often they are inspected:
1) wear;
2) retroreflectivity (dry);
3) retroreflectivity (wet);
4) colour;
5) luminance factor or luminance co-efficient; and
6) skid resistance.
2.11.1
The needs and priorities of those characteristics deemed important for any given inspection site should
be assessed.
NOTE
Road markings characteristics detailed above, combined with the site characteristics, present differing
inspection priorities for lit and unlit locations.
Retroreflecting road studs
2.12
Visual inspections of retroreflective road studs shall be carried out at intervals in accordance with the
requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
2.13
Where surface break-up is apparent due to replacement roads studs being placed too close to
historical stud locations, this shall be recorded on inspections.
2.14
All inspections shall be programmed to enable maintenance works to be completed before the winter
season.
2.15
Inspections shall be carried out after the winter season to detect damage by snow ploughs in affected
areas.
Light emitting (active) road studs
2.16
The inspection regimes for light emitting (active) road studs shall be determined in line with the
manufacturers requirements.

Inspection methods
General
3.1
Visual assessment surveys shall be carried out to obtain an overview of performance (see Appendix B
Table B.1).
NOTE
Photographic examples for visual assessments of road markings can be found in Appendix C.
Road markings
3.2
Visual assessment surveys shall be carried out for measuring wear.
3.3
Where machine surveys are not undertaken, visual digital surveys for assessing dry nighttime
retroreflectivity shall be undertaken, using the method of determining preview times and visibility
distances provided in Section 5.
NOTE
Visual assessment surveys can be employed to confirm visibility of road marking preview times both in
daytime and nighttime dry conditions, although on unlit roads the nighttime performance is likely to be
the most important factor.
3.4
The network shall be formally surveyed in accordance with the requirements of the Overseeing
Organisation for each route and homogeneous sections of a route.
3.4.1
A mixture of survey techniques may be appropriate.
3.4.2
Visual assessment surveys may be supplemented by machine surveys and/or residual performance
data taken before replacement or renewal.
NOTE
For example, detailed measurements of smaller samples can be used as supporting evidence, if
generally using higher level assessment for markings known to be of similar age, traffic level and
material.
Machine surveys
3.5
All survey devices and techniques (including vehicle mounted devices and handheld spectrometer
devices) shall be approved by the Overseeing Organisation and calibrated and maintained in line with
the manufacturer's recommendations as described in BS EN 1436 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE
Appendix B provides additional information on the use of current survey techniques for different
circumstances.
3.6
Vehicle mounted device survey results shall be aggregated and reported over 100m lengths.
Detailed surveys and skid resistance measurement
3.7
Where planned road closures can be utilised, hand held devices shall be used to provide a primary
data source for characteristics not measurable from vehicle mounted devices, as well as spot checking
measurements obtained from vehicle mounted devices, i.e. retroreflectivity of longitudinal markings.
3.7.1
Hand held devices may be used on areas of the network that cannot be surveyed using vehicle
mounted devices.
NOTE
For example, "STOP" and "Give Way" lines, "SLOW" markings, yellow bar markings, lane designations
and exit arrows.
3.8
Hand held devices shall be used when wet retroreflectivity data is required as described in BS EN 1436
[Ref 9.N].
3.9
Where detailed assessment is carried out, the survey area shall be split into 100m segments for record
storage purposes and carrying out the following assessments:
1) wear assessment:

CS 126 Version 0.1.0
3. Inspection methods
a) for continuous longitudinal markings, measurement of a 5m length every 20m. Results are
presented as averaged values;
b) for other markings, including modular longitudinal road markings, the assessment is to be carried
out on the worst worn 25% of the markings at each location. Results are presented as averaged
values;
2) retroreflectivity using a handheld device (see Section B1.4 in Appendix B);
3) an assessment of the luminance. Measurement of luminance factor of structured (Type II) markings
is potentially unreliable. A marking is required to meet either the threshold for luminance factor or
luminance co-efficient in Appendix B Table B.2.
3.10
Skid resistance measurements shall be carried out on a representative sample of defined critical areas
of the network.
3.11
Critical areas shall be defined taking into account the examples given in Appendix B Table B.3 and the
condition or age of the road marking material.
3.12
Measurements shall be taken on the most trafficked areas of the road markings at each location and an
average calculated.
Preview time of road markings
3.13
Where visual assessments are used to both identify defects and to provide quantifiable performance
data then marking preview times shall be identified, as shown in Table 5.3.
NOTE
The preview time is the number of seconds taken to drive a distance equal to the road marking visibility
distance.
3.14
Where performing surveys to ascertain preview times, the selected survey vehicle shall replicate the
circumstances of a typical vehicle and driver.
3.15
To determine accurate visibility distances in a moving vehicle, visual digital equipment shall be used
and mounted at a normal driving height.
NOTE
Use of visual digital data can allow initial desktop review of road marking preview times.
3.16
Where requested by the Overseeing Organisation independent evidence shall be provided to
demonstrate that visual digital survey replicates road users' experience when obtaining preview times
and distances.
Retroreflective road studs
3.17
Bi-directional retro reflecting road studs installed on single carriageway roads shall be inspected for
defects in both directions.
3.18
Inspections for reflective conspicuity of retroreflecting road studs shall be carried out during hours of
darkness.
3.18.1
Retroreflective road stud inspections should be carried out to be synchronized with night outage
inspections referred to in TS 501 [Ref 6.N] Road lighting inspection and CS 125 [Ref 2.N] Inspection of
traffic signs.
3.19
The daytime visual inspection shall be in accordance with the methods set out in Appendix B Figure
B.4 for the following characteristics:
1) identification of unlawful double–studding;
2) wear, corrosion, gaps, voids, ponding, damage;
3) loose or missing studs or inserts;
4) loss of or damage to retroreflective lenses, sinkage or settlement or masking due to adjacent raised
road surfacing (e.g. surface dressing);
5) detritus on lenses or masking by adhesive;

3. Inspection methods
6) integrity and security of casings of "embedded" studs (housings);
7) loss of adhesion or breaking up of surface mounted road studs under traffic loading; and
8) misalignment with existing road markings.
3.20
Visual inspections for night-time performance of retroreflective road studs shall be carried out during
the hours of darkness using a reference sample in accordance with the method set out in Appendix B
Figure B.5.
3.21
The definition of "safety critical location" for retroreflective road studs (as shown in Appendix B, Figure
B.5) shall be agreed in accordance with the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation and include
the following locations:
1) regulatory markings e.g. double white lines, solid edged ghost islands;
2) lay-bys, including emergency areas;
3) merge and diverge tapers;
4) roads where the horizontal alignment constitutes a departure from standard from CD 109 [Ref 1.N];
and
5) light emitting (active) road stud locations.
3.22
Retroreflective road stud inspections shall be arranged (with specific road closures) where significant
groupings of displacement have occurred.
NOTE
For example, 3 or more consecutive road studs.
3.23
Wear along the shoulders of the casting shall be checked when re-rubbering into existing inset
castings, of embedded retroreflective road studs.
3.23.1
Re-rubbering into a worn casting may cause accelerated wear of the insert and can lead to its insert
becoming detached.

4. Defect categories
4.
Defect categories
4.1
Defects shall be categorised as critical or non-critical, using the requirements of this document,
including the methodology given in Appendix B.
4.2
A road marking shall be deemed a critical defect three years after its application where there is no
record of its expected functional life and no recorded value of in-service performance.
4.3
For road markings in defined critical areas, this period shall be reduced to two years after the marking
is laid.
4.4
Where the expected functional life of a road marking is known, the road marking shall be deemed a
non-critical defect after that period is reached and re-classified as a critical defect one year after it is
reached, except where recorded in-service performance identifies higher performance or a critical
defect.
4.5
A road marking with more than 30% of the surface area worn down to the road surface shall have a
wear index, as identified in Appendix B, of less than 30.
4.6
Where the road marking is regulatory or is in a critical area with less than 70% of the surface area
remaining, it shall be categorised as a critical defect.
4.7
Raised rib road markings with a wear index of 30 or more (refer to Appendix B, Table B.1), affecting a
length of road marking equal to or greater than the desirable minimum preview distance, as defined in
Section 5, shall be re-categorised as a critical defect where the residual rib height is;
1) 6mm or less on motorways;
2) 3mm or less on all-purpose trunk roads.
4.8
Road marking preview time values (as shown in Table 5.3) lower than the absolute minimum shall be
classed as critical defects.
4.9
Road marking preview time values (as shown in Table 5.3) between absolute minimum and desirable
minimum shall be classed as non-critical defects.
4.10
Loose casings of embedded road studs shall be classed as a critical defect.
4.10.1
Detailed inspections for this purpose should be carried out when lane closures for other activities are in
operation.

General
5.1
A risk based inspection regime for road markings and retroreflecting road studs shall result in the
identification of any defects.
Road markings
5.2
Visual assessments surveys shall be undertaken to measure the wear index/score of road markings, as
identified in Appendix B.
5.3
Visual digital surveys for dry nighttime retroreflectivity shall use preview times and visibility distances as
shown in Table 5.3 at locations where no machine survey data is available.

NOTE
The preview time values presented in Table 5.3 are based on the assumption that typical vehicles are
used i.e. a typical family car with standard headlight height and output not exceeding 1150 lumens.
5.4
On multi-lane carriageways each lane shall be assessed separately.
5.5
Where nearside and offside road markings are present and are visible for different distances, the
longest achieved visibility can be used, but both shall be recorded.
5.6
For all visual survey methods (excluding calibrated visual digital play back and stationary observation
during a road closure), the age of the observer shall be applied in accordance with the correction
percentages in Table 5.6.
Table 5.6 Age related corrections to achieve visibility distances from initial surveys
Age (years) related corrections to visibility distances
Age <30

-2.4%
N/A
NOTE
In Table 5.6 the corrections take account of the fact that eye structures become less effective as a
person ages. For example if a 31 one year old carrying out the test can see a road marking at 100m,
the survey record will show a corrected distance of 90.5m to take account of the relatively young age of
the observer.
5.7
Road markings shall exceed the values identified in Appendix B Tables B.2 and B.3 for the
characteristics included in BS EN 1436 [Ref 9.N].
5.8
Specific locations where road markings framed by longitudinal road markings are subject to increased
wear or deterioration (e.g. reduced lane widths, reduced ghost island width) shall be identified and
managed in accordance with the requirements of the Overseeing Organisation.
5.9
Visual inspections of road markings framed by longitudinal road markings shall identify specific
locations where additional sweeping is required in order to deal with build-up of detritus that can affect
the legibility of road markings of this type.

Physical characteristics of active road studs not related to the active element shall be inspected in the
same manner as retroreflecting road studs, if not specified by the manufacturer or in the type approval
document.
Street lighting regimes
5.11
Where street lights are dimmed or switched off (full or part-time), road markings and retroreflecting road
studs shall be inspected as if the road is unlit.
Special circumstances
5.12
Health and safety files of schemes completed since the last inspection shall be reviewed to enable any
site specific performance requirements to be identified.
NOTE
For example, at a safety critical location, wet night retroreflectivity might have been increased.

Detailed visual assessment scoring system
Table B.1 provides information on visual assessment scoring. Photographic examples for each of the
scores below can be found in Appendix C. The visual assessment system should be applied to each
road marking and aggregated over 100m. The assessment should not mix materials or line types i.e.
each line type should be associated with its own averaged score. In the case of lane dividing lines,
each lane line should also be associated with its own average score.
Use of Table B.1 may be required when carrying out the process in Figures B.1 and B.2 for vehicle
mounted surveys.
Where detritus or vegetation encroaches onto a road marking the assessment score should be taken
before and after remedial action has been taken to remove the defect. The defect should be scored
and categorised in the same way as wear defects based on the residual visible area.

Note 2: Critical areas of the network refer to those areas of the network that may pose a risk to the road
user if badly worn. These should be defined with local knowledge and should include:
1) "Give Way" lines and "STOP" signs;
2) regulatory road markings, e.g. double white lines, solid edged ghost islands;
3) large areas of markings, e.g. "SLOW" markings, exit arrows to slips on the main line and
on-carriageway 'destinations';
4) transverse yellow bars;
5) road markings at or within 50m of a junction.

"Road marking performance for road users".
B1.4.2
Number of readings
For continuous lines, take 15 readings over a 5 metre section minimum. If the marking is a centre line,
take 15 readings with the equipment facing in each direction.

For broken lines, take 5 readings per mark for 3 consecutive marks. Readings should not be taken at
the very beginning or end of the line. If the marking is a centre line, take 5 readings with the equipment
facing in each direction.
For markings wider than 150mm, take readings down the central axis of the line but including some
"off-centre" ensuring that any such measurements are still made within the confines of the marking.
For other markings, i.e. 'symbols', 'lettering', transverse lines etc., readings should be taken at
approximately 5 equidistant points on the surface of the marking.
If a particular reading appears inconsistent, that reading should be repeated.
B1.4.3
Recording and interpretation of results
A survey report for each location should be produced in a format agreed by the Overseeing
Organisation, to include for example averages or sub-totals of markings.
B1.4.4
Measurement of retrospective in conditions of wetness
Where required, the inspection method for conditions of wetness, as described in BS EN 1436 [Ref
9.N]. The inspection methods for "conditions of rain" is not intended for use with the standard
measuring equipment currently in general use in the UK.

Comparison of vehicle mounted device and handheld retroreflectometer
readings
B2.1
Advantages and disadvantages of different devices
Advantages of using vehicle mounted devices are that they provide:
1) savings in traffic management costs as road closures are not required;
2) fast and reliable data collection on straight roads for decision making; and
3) a focus for further investigations.
Disadvantages of using vehicle mounted devices are that:
1) they do not give consistently the same results as hand held instruments for site location and hence
multiplication factors may be required as described below;
2) they can generate large amounts of missing data for single carriageway roads as vehicles cannot
drive sufficiently close to centrelines due to oncoming traffic;
3) the level of data confidence can vary, dependent on device; and
4) they can only measure dry retroreflectivity values and therefore require dry conditions, if required by
vehicle manufacturer, to produce accurate results.
Advantages of using handheld instruments are:
1) they are reliable for small areas or areas where use can be made of existing road closures (for other
reasons) or where vehicle mounted devices are not suitable; e.g. closely spaced junctions or heavily
trafficked single carriageways;
2) they can be used to measure wet retroreflectivity values; and
3) they are easily carried.
Disadvantages of using handheld instruments are:
1) they do not provide the same results as vehicle mounted devices for the same spots; and
2) road closures (with associated risks for road workers) are required for taking readings.
B2.2
Correlation factors
Where hand held readings are taken, they should be recorded over lengths no shorter than 50m for
averaging purposes. Manufacturers produce correlation factors and these should be applied converting
a vehicle mounted device reading to an equivalent reading by a hand held instrument.

Contract
Legal document that states the formal agreement between two different groups,
enforceable by law. In some forms of procurement this is termed as an
"Agreement".
Critical areas
Critical areas of the network refer to those areas of the network that can pose a
risk to the road user if badly worn.
Skid resistance
Measurement on road markings carried out using the standard British pendulum
apparatus. BS EN 1436 [Ref 2.N] specifies skid resistance classes.

Inspection frequencies
Road markings
Representative sample (CS 126, 2.9)
E/1.1
For a representative sample of road marking data, a minimum of 10% of the network shall be collected
each year for each characteristic, or for safety critical areas, 20% of the network.
NOTE
This evidence can be from measurements taken between renewals, using road closures undertaken
specifically (if necessary) or evidence taken when road or lane closures are applied for other reasons.
E/1.2
Where there is insufficient data to undertake a risk based inspection process the following maximum
intervals shall not be exceeded, for the initial inspection:
1) retroreflection of road markings - safety critical locations: two years, other locations: three years;
2) visual survey of markings for wear - yearly;
3) road studs - six months for visual surveys.

To align with national contracts in England, the score range currently illustrated in CS 126 Appendix B,
Table B.1 and the photographs shown in Appendix C shall be converted in accordance with Table
E/3.1N2.
NOTE 1
For example, in CS 126, a score of 30 is equivalent to a revised score of 3.
NOTE 2
There is no equivalent to the score of 0 as it is considered that the marking has ceased to exist at this
point.
