Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the design requirements and advice to be followed in selecting highway
cross-sections and headrooms on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 18.N] apply to this document.
Cross-section components
Range of choice
The cross-section is made up from a combination of distinct components that vary depending upon the
type of highway and the facilities provided for the various users of the route. The components which
make up a typical cross-section are shown in the diagrams below.
Where this document permits options for the dimensions of components, the decision making process
needs to assess the impact on safety, environment, cost, buildability, operation, maintenance and other
design constraints.

Definition
Headroom
The minimum distance between the surface of the carriageway and
a structure (accounting for any deflection due to temporary or
permanent attachments) measured at right angles to the surface of
the carriageway.
Mainline
The major carriageway. At a junction the mainline typically has a
higher road classification and / or carries greater traffic volumes.
Maintained headroom
The minimum value of headroom to be preserved at all times.
Maintaining organisation
The organisation commissioned to undertake the maintenance of
an asset.
New construction headroom
The value of headroom for new structures that includes an
additional allowance for deflection of the structure and future road
realignment and resurfacing.
Overbridge
A bridge that spans above the road being considered.
Paved width
A collective term for the surface of the cross-section that comprises
the carriageway, hard shoulder and hard strips (including
designated lanes and cycle lanes).
Paved width headroom
The value of headroom over the paved width.
Rural roads
An all-purpose road or motorway that is generally not subjected to
a local speed limit.
Separator zone
An area that separates traffic flows on the mainline from an
adjacent parallel road, e.g. link road.
Slip road
A connector road between a mainline carriageway and another
road.
NOTE: At the end of a slip road, traffic can encounter a priority
junction, a roundabout or traffic signals.
Standard headroom
Either maintained headroom or new construction headroom, as
appropriate.
Structure
Any object with the primary purpose of bearing loads.
NOTE: This includes bridges, footbridges, retaining walls and sign
or signal gantries, but excludes more frangible items such as
deformable vehicle restraint systems.
Structure free zone
A buffer zone beneath a structure located at the central reserve and
at the verges adjacent to the paved width, that reduces the risk of
errant vehicle impacts by providing an appropriate value of
headroom.
Subway
Underground passageway or tunnel for use by pedestrians,
cyclists, and sometimes equestrians.
Underbridge
A bridge that carries the road being considered over another road,
railway or watercourse.
Urban roads - motorway
A motorway with a speed limit of 60 mph or less within a built-up
area.

A safety system installed at the edges of the carriageway to provide
vehicle restraint.
Verge
Any nominally flat area between the edge of the paved width and
either the start of an adjacent side slope or, in the absence of a side
slope, the highway boundary or bridge parapet.
Wide highway corridor
Any all-purpose dual carriageway with more than 3 mainline lanes
or motorway with more than 4 mainline lanes in any one direction.

NOTE 2
All dimensions in Figures 2.1.1N1a to 2.1.1N1h are in metres.
NOTE 3
Offside lane widths are measured to the trafficked side of the offside edge line (rural) or face of offside
kerb (urban).
NOTE 4
Details provided for dual carriageways are applicable for both sides of the road.
NOTE 5
The TSM Chapter 5 ISBN 9780115532085 [Ref 29.N] provides guidance on the widths of road
markings.
Traffic lane width
2.2
Traffic lane widths for horizontal curvature greater than 400 metres radii shall be in accordance with
Figures 2.1.1N1a to 2.1.1N1h.
NOTE 1
Traffic lane widths for carriageways with horizontal curve radii of greater than 90 metres but below 400
metres are given in CD 109 [Ref 13.N].
NOTE 2
Traffic lane widths at junctions where the horizontal curve radii are 90 metres or less are given in CD
123 [Ref 11.N].
2.3
Traffic lane widths shall be measured between the trafficked side of carriageway edge lines and the
centre of lane lines.
Hard strips
2.4
Nearside hard strips shall be provided as shown in Figures 2.1.1N1a to 2.1.1N1h.
2.5
The minimum width of offside hard strips (dimension F) shall be as shown in Figures 2.1.1N1a to
2.1.1N1h.
2.6
The maximum width of offside hard strips (dimension F) shall be 1.00 metre.
NOTE 1
Offside hard strip widths up to 1.00 metre can be appropriate where the road falls to the offside and
additional drainage surface area is required.
NOTE 2
A hard strip provides a surfaced strip that abuts the carriageway. The key reasons for the provision of
hard strips include:
1) pavement integrity/stability;
2) partial provision for stopped vehicles;
3) snow and water collection;
4) overrun facility for driver error or evasive action;
5) improved level of service and driver comfort;
6) supports edge lines;
7) reduces the risk of vegetation encroachment over edge lines; and
8) allows for the placement of road studs outside vehicle wheel paths, where appropriate.
Hard shoulders
2.7
Nearside hard shoulders shall be provided as shown in Figures 2.1.1N1a to 2.1.1N1h.
NOTE
The hard shoulder is provided adjacent to the nearside of the carriageway to offer a place to stop in
emergencies, clear of mainline traffic. It also provides access for emergency vehicles and additional
road space during temporary traffic management.
2.8
Offside hard shoulders shall not be permitted.
Central reserves
2.9
Minimum central reserve widths shall be as shown in Figures 2.1.1N1a to Figure 2.1.1N1h except
where the offside hard strip has been widened for drainage.

CD 127 Version 1.0.1
2. Highway cross-sections
NOTE
Where the offside hard strip has been widened for drainage, the central reserve can be reduced by up
to the same value as the increase in the offside hard strip.
2.9.1
The central reserve may be widened in order to:
1) provide the requisite stopping sight distances in accordance with CD 109 [Ref 13.N];
2) accommodate any street furniture, utility, drainage features or equipment;
3) meet the requirements for vehicle restraint systems (VRS);
4) accommodate any permanent signs required with particular attention to the provision of the required
working width and set-back for VRSs relative to the complete sign assembly;
5) accommodate significant difference in levels of adjacent carriageways;
6) accommodate temporary traffic management layouts for the envisaged maintenance regime;
7) accommodate matrix signs and signals;
8) accommodate any parts of structures or complete structures;
9) provide sufficient space for maintenance operations;
10) fulfil landscape and environmental objectives; and
11) accommodate walking, cycling and horse-riding routes.
NOTE
Requirements and advice for the widening of central reserves at priority junctions are given in CD 123
[Ref 11.N].
2.9.2
The central reserve should be hardened or have low growth species of grass to minimise the need for
maintenance.
2.9.3
When deciding whether to harden central reserves, the design should:
1) check the adequacy of the surface water drainage system to accommodate any additional surface
water run-off;
2) make an assessment of environmental factors, such as the landscape character of the setting and
location of the road, the environmental consequences of weed control and the function of the central
reserve as potential habitat;
3) determine the area to be hardened, based on what areas of vegetation can be left uncut without
affecting visibility or sign conspicuity; and
4) take account of whole-life costs and safety considerations.
2.9.4
Away from crossovers, any hardening of the central reserve should be designed to be capable of
withstanding vehicle over-run and prevent vegetation growth.
NOTE
For further requirements and advice on landscape design see LA 101 [Ref 17.N], LA 102 [Ref 26.N], LA
103 [Ref 25.N], LA 104 [Ref 8.N], LA 107 [Ref 19.N] and LD 117 [Ref 20.N].
2.9.5
Where the hardened area could be misused by road users, contrasting coloured surfacing may be used
in the central reserve, although this is only likely to be necessary where the VRS set-back is 1.50
metres or greater.
NOTE 1
In some situations it can be appropriate to continue the coloured surface across the whole central
reserve.
NOTE 2
In other situations, for reasons of cost or aesthetics, the width of the coloured surfacing can be limited
to the traffic side of the VRS.
Verges
2.10
Minimum verge widths shall be as shown in Figures 2.1.1.N1a to 2.1.1.N1h, except where:
1) there is a need for increased width to accommodate communication ducts and chambers;
2) the offside hard strip is being widened for drainage; or

2. Highway cross-sections
3) the nearside verge on a single lane rural all-purpose connector road is located immediately adjacent
to the highway boundary.
2.11
Where the offside hard strip has been widened for drainage, the reduction of the offside verge shall be
no more than the increase in the offside hard strip.
2.11.1
Thin strips of grass or other vegetation within the highway cross-section should be avoided as they can
result in safety issues related to maintenance.
NOTE 1
The verge offers an important component in highway drainage systems, including the storage of snow
displaced from the carriageway. It offers an area to support utility plant and to house highway
equipment. Congested verges with insufficient room for necessary roadside components present both
safety and engineering difficulties.
NOTE 2
Documents CD 143 [Ref 6.N] and CD 195 [Ref 5.N] provide requirements and advice on the
appropriate widths of facilities for walking, cycling and horse-riding and the horizontal separation
(verge) from the carriageway.
2.12
Where the nearside verge on a single lane rural all-purpose connector road is located immediately
adjacent to the highway boundary, the verge shall be increased by a minimum of 0.50 metres over the
values given in Figure 2.1.1.N1f.
2.13
Where Figures 2.1.1.N1a to 2.1.1.N1h indicate the verge width "varies" and it is necessary to
accommodate communications ducting and chambers, a minimum verge width of 2.00 metres shall be
provided.
2.13.1
Where Figures 2.1.1.N1a to 2.1.1.N1h indicate verge width "varies" or where the verge width needs to
be increased over the minimum value, the verge should be designed where applicable to:
1) accommodate the requisite stopping sight distances in accordance with CD 109 [Ref 13.N];
2) accommodate any street furniture, utility, drainage features or equipment;
3) meet the requirements for VRS ( CD 377 [Ref 22.N]);
4) accommodate any permanent signs required with particular attention to the provision of the required
working width and set-back for VRSs relative to the complete sign assembly;
5) accommodate significant level differences;
6) accommodate temporary traffic management layouts for the envisaged maintenance regime;
7) accommodate matrix signs and signals;
8) accommodate any parts of structures or complete structures;
9) provide sufficient space for maintenance operations;
10) fulfil landscape and environmental objectives including environmental fencing;
11) accommodate walking, cycling and horse-riding routes; and/or
12) provide for access to emergency telephones or provide a safe location for stranded motorists.
Wide carriageways
Mainline lane provision
2.14
All-purpose dual carriageways shall not have more than three mainline lanes in one direction.
2.15
Motorways shall not have more than four mainline lanes in one direction.
NOTE
Auxiliary lanes are not included when determining the number of mainline lanes on all-purpose dual
carriageways and motorways.
Auxiliary lane provision
2.16
Where auxiliary lanes are provided, the width of the auxiliary lane(s) shall be equal to the width of the
adjacent nearside mainline lane.

The provision of either a hard shoulder or a hard strip adjacent to an auxiliary lane shall be consistent
with the provision on the mainline.
Connector road lane provision
2.18
Where a junction capacity assessment has identified additional connector road lanes are required at
the junction at the end of the slip road, the lane width requirements for additional lanes shall be:
1) where the additional lane(s) is 100 metres or less in length, the lane width is derived from the
junction document ( CD 122 [Ref 12.N] or CD 123 [Ref 11.N]) for the type of junction at the end of
the slip road, see Figure 2.18a;
2) where the additional lane(s) is greater than 100 metres in length, the lane width is 3.65 metres wide
plus any allowance for widening at tight radii, see Figures 2.18b and 2.19 (see section on "Traffic
lane width").

Hard shoulder and hard strip widths adjacent to the additional connector road lanes shall be consistent
with the upstream connector road provision.
NOTE 1
For further requirements and advice on determining the required number of lanes, hard shoulder and
hard strip provision on connector roads, see CD 122 [Ref 12.N].
NOTE 2
Compliant widths of single lane connector roads allow routine maintenance activities to be undertaken.
Full resurfacing within such widths is unlikely to be possible without closing the connector road.
NOTE 3
Compliant widths of two lane connector roads allow all maintenance activities to be undertaken,
including full resurfacing, without having to close the connector road.
2.21
For connector roads that carry two-way traffic for some of their length, the minimum width of central
reserve shall be as shown in Figure 2.1.1N1a, Figure 2.1.1N1c, Figure 2.1.1N1e and Figure 2.1.1N1g.
Separator zones
2.22
Headlight glare from any lane of a parallel road that runs counter to the mainline traffic flow shall not
affect main line traffic.
NOTE
Headlight glare can be managed through the use of a separator zone.
2.22.1
Where a separator zone is used to manage headlight glare from a parallel road, it should be wide
enough to accommodate the following features (where applicable):
1) the requisite stopping sight distances in accordance with CD 109 [Ref 13.N];
2) any street furniture, utility or drainage features and equipment;
3) the working width and set-back requirements for VRS;
4) any permanent signs required with particular attention to the provision of the required working width
and set-back for VRSs relative to the complete sign assembly;
5) any difference in levels of adjacent carriageways;
6) temporary traffic management layouts for the envisaged maintenance regime;
7) matrix signs and signals;
8) any parts of structures or complete structures;
9) space for maintenance operations;
10) landscaping and environmental provision;
11) walking, cycling and horse-riding routes; and
12) the occupants of broken down vehicles.
2.22.2
Methods to eliminate headlight glare may include:
1) designing the alignments of the roads to provide level differences;
2) screening fences or earthbunds;
3) soft planting that provides foliage all year round at the correct heights; and
4) a VRS system that is designed to cut off glare where a VRS system is to be installed.
Raised rib edge lines
2.23
Nearside and offside edge line road markings on motorway mainline and connector roads shall have
raised ribs in accordance with diagram 1012.2 (schedule 11, part 4, item 12) of the SI 2016 No 362
(TSRGD) 2016 [Ref 23.N].
NOTE
Raised rib road markings can be used on all-purpose trunk roads in accordance with diagram 1012.3
(schedule 11, Part 4, item 13) of the SI 2016 No 362 (TSRGD) 2016 [Ref 23.N].
VRS set-back
2.24
The minimum dimensions for VRS set-back shall be as shown in Table 2.24 and are illustrated in
Figures 2.25a to 2.25d.

Notes:
Relaxations to set-back are permitted as follows:
1) Relaxation to 600mm for roads of speed limit 50mph or less (including temporary mandatory
speed limits).
2) Relaxation to 1000mm at existing roads with physical constraints (e.g. a structure) where it could
be difficult to provide the desirable value.
3) Relaxation to 450mm where it is considered necessary to position the VRS away from the edge
of an existing embankment in order to provide support to the foundation.
2.25
The set-back shall be the lateral distance between the traffic face of a safety barrier and:
1) nearside: the back of the nearside hard strip or hard shoulder;
2) nearside: the kerb face for roads without a nearside hard strip or hard shoulder;
3) offside: the trafficked edge of the edge line;
4) offside: the kerb face where there is no edge line.

2. Highway cross-sections
non-standard lane widths are proposed;
2) in verges with a hard strip or hard shoulder: the effects on the ability of occupants of parked vehicles
to leave via the nearside doors and the possibility of increased risk due to parking closer to live
traffic;
3) in verges without a hard strip or hard shoulder: the effects on vehicle positioning within traffic lanes,
particularly where non-standard lane widths are proposed; and
4) in all cases: the effects on future temporary traffic management systems, e.g. a reduced set-back,
can limit the width available for temporary traffic management.
NOTE 3
Physical objects such as VRS immediately adjacent to the edge of the carriageway can result in drivers
reducing speed and positioning their vehicles away from the obstruction. The purpose of the set-back
is to provide a lateral distance between the VRS and the carriageway which reduces the effect of the
safety barrier on driver behaviour.
2.25.1
Set-back greater than the minimum values should be provided in the following circumstances:
1) at verges for roads where continuous or near continuous VRS is proposed to prevent a driver from
mounting the verge in an emergency;
2) where use of the minimum set-back in central reserves can result in the paved width being closer
than 600mm to the VRS; and
3) to achieve a smooth alignment with a parapet.
2.26
On central reserves where there are no obstructions and there is only one double sided deformable
safety barrier between carriageways, the minimum set-back on both sides of the safety barrier shall be
as stipulated in Table 2.24 but also no less than the working width of the safety barrier minus the actual
width of the safety barrier.
Kerbs (away from bridge decks)
2.27
Kerbs shall be specified in accordance with BS EN 1340 [Ref 2.N]: Concrete Kerb Units
- Requirements and Test Methods and the minimum requirements of Series 1100.
NOTE 1
Kerbs are used to:
1) provide physical or visual delineation and minor restraint, particularly between surfaces intended for
different users such as footways and carriageways; and/or
2) create drainage channels.
NOTE 2
Further requirements and advice relating to the use of kerbs as a drainage feature are given in CD 524
[Ref 7.N].
2.27.1
In urban areas where footways are present adjacent to the carriageway, bullnose or half battered kerbs
with an upstand of at least 100mm should be provided.
2.27.2
In rural areas where a footway is less than 1.30 metres from the carriageway edge, half battered kerbs
with an upstand of 100mm should be provided.
NOTE
Half battered or bullnose kerbs with an upstand of 100mm or more can act as a form of minor restraint
to light traffic, thereby reducing the risk of vehicles overrunning the edge of the carriageway. This is
particularly important at junctions where vehicles are undertaking sharper turns.
2.27.3
In rural areas where a footway is more than 1.30 metres from the carriageway edge, full battered kerbs
with an upstand of 75mm should be provided.
NOTE
Full battered kerbs with an upstand of 75mm are used in rural areas where it is considered safer for an
errant vehicle travelling at high speed to be able to mount the kerb with a reduced risk of overturning
e.g. at features such as traffic islands and roundabouts.
2.27.4
Where there are no adjacent footways, kerbs should not be provided except where they are necessary
for drainage purposes or to act as a minor restraint, e.g. at traffic islands and in structures or tunnels.

NOTE
At rural junctions with corner radii of 10 metres or less and where there is no adjacent footway, upstand
kerbs can be provided to reduce the risk of vehicles overrunning the verge.
2.27.5
Where it is necessary to lower kerbs they should be laid flush with the carriageway or with a maximum
upstand of 6mm using bullnose kerbs for the purpose of retaining water where the carriageway falls
towards the kerb.
NOTE 1
It can be necessary to lower kerbs at private accesses, pedestrian crossings and the start / end of cycle
tracks.
NOTE 2
For requirements and advice for kerbs at bridge decks see Section 3 of this document.
Rate of change of cross-section width
2.28
The minimum transition tapers for the rate of change in the cross-section width of mainline lanes,
connector road lanes and hard shoulder width shall be in accordance with Table 2.28.

Where a transition taper is used to change cross-section between two adjoining links with differing
design speeds, the higher design speed of the two links shall be used.

3. Highway cross-sections at structures
NOTE
Occasionally it is necessary to provide a single lane in each direction separated by a central reserve.
For instance, certain landmark bridges featuring a central cable stay with a single traffic lane either side.
Walking, cycling and horse-riding provision at structures
3.2
The provision for walking, cycling and horse-riding, including horizontal separation from the
carriageway, at a structure shall be at least equivalent to any provision immediately upstream and
downstream of the structure.
Central reserves
3.3
Minimum central reserve widths derived from Section 2 of this document shall be continued through or
across the structure.
NOTE
Central reserve widening can be necessary through a structure where a central pier is located in the
central reserve.
Verges
3.4
For overbridges and underbridges the verge width derived from Section 2 of this document shall be
continued through the structure.
Raised verges and central reserves on bridge decks
3.5
The maximum kerb height of raised central reserves shall be 75mm.
3.6
For cross-sections above bridge decks where the VRS is a parapet, a raised verge of 600mm minimum
width and with a maximum kerb height of 75mm shall be provided between the paved width and
adjacent parapets, and this applies to both the nearside or offside.
NOTE
Limiting the height of the kerb upstand to 75mm minimises the risk of an errant vehicle being projected
upwards upon impact.
Accommodation bridges
3.7
Any discussions with landowners with respect to accommodation bridges and the resulting agreed
provision shall be recorded in a formal agreement.
3.7.1
When deriving the widths of accommodation bridges the following criteria should be assessed:
1) the agreed reasonable needs of the respective private landowner;
2) the size of vehicles, particularly agricultural vehicles, that can reasonably be expected to use the
bridge;
3) maintenance requirements; and
4) the needs of walkers, cyclists and horse-riders in locations where they have legal right of way.

CD 127 Version 1.0.1
4. Headrooms at structures
New structures
4.9
New bridges and highway structures shall be designed to have a minimum new construction headroom
and a minimum paved width headroom equal to or greater than the new construction headroom given
in Table 4.1.
NOTE
Paved width includes the width of the carriageway plus any hard shoulders and hard strips.
4.9.1
Headroom should be greater than the minimum given in Table 4.1 where:
1) the location presents a high risk of vehicle impact based on previous records;
2) forward visibility is affected due to sags (comfort criteria for sag curves can be obtained from CD 109
[Ref 13.N];
3) forward visibility is affected due to overhead signs and signals;
4) future maintenance of the bridge and pavement can result in a reduction of the headroom;
5) it is economical with regards to the whole life costs of the structure and pavement;
6) accommodation of services or apparatus is required;
7) there are other site specific constraints (such as access limitations);
8) lightweight structures (such as footbridges) are passing above the road;
9) it is environmentally sustainable.
4.9.2
Where the headroom of existing structures on a route is greater than the new construction headroom
given in Table 4.1, and where an increase of the new construction headroom for new structures does
not have a significant impact to the overall construction cost, new structures should have the same
headroom as the existing structures.
NOTE 1
Providing headroom uniformity along an existing route can reduce the probability of vehicular impact.
NOTE 2
Existing robust structures along a route with a greater headroom than the new construction headroom,
can provide protection to new lightweight structures (such as footbridges) against vehicular impacts,
only if the new structures have an equal or greater headroom than the headroom of the existing robust
structures.
4.10
Where a trunk road passes over other authorities infrastructure or third party land, the headroom
provision shall be agreed with the relevant authority or landowner.
4.10.1
Where a trunk road passes over other authorities infrastructure or third party land, the minimum
headroom at under-bridges should be subject to the minimums quoted in this document.
NOTE
Infrastructure can include rail and navigable canals.
Existing structures
4.11
Existing bridges and highway structures shall have a minimum maintained headroom and a minimum
paved width headroom preserved at all times in accordance with Table 4.1.
NOTE
Re-surfacing of the paved width can result to an increase of the pavement's level which can lead to a
reduction of the headroom.
4.11.1
Where structural strengthening is required beneath a superstructure, the adopted strengthening
techniques should have a minimum impact on headroom.
4.12
The design organisation shall inform the Overseeing Organisation of any change of the headroom.
NOTE
Up to date bridge records for the maintained headroom can facilitate the implementation of accurate
planning systems for the movement of high loads on a route.
4.13
Where a headroom is found to be less than the minimum maintained headroom over the paved width in
accordance with Table 4.1, the maintaining organisation shall:
1) immediately notify the Overseeing Organisation;

4. Headrooms at structures
2) carry out a risk assessment and manage the structure in accordance with the outcome of the risk
assessment.
4.14
Where as-built records of the structure are available, verification of the headroom on site shall be made
after a review of the available information.
NOTE 1
A review of the available information and as-built records can:
1) reduce the risk of a measurement error;
2) contribute towards identifying health and safety risks and hazards and implementing the appropriate
health and safety measures during the site visit.
NOTE 2
Vertical measurements to verify and record the minimum headroom are made in accordance with CS
450 [Ref 15.N].
4.14.1
Vertical measurements should be taken at different locations along the paved width area and within the
SFZ such as:
1) from the top of the raised verges and central reserve;
2) where a sag curve is present, from the outermost point of the curve;
3) below both edges of the superstructure in the transverse direction to assess the minimum headroom
against any cross-sectional deck inclination.
Utilities companies and other authorities apparatus
4.15
Where utility companies or other authorities (such as rail or legislative bodies) require greater
headroom, any such increase shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Utility companies or other authorities can require an increased headroom to achieve sufficient vertical
clearance to pass their services above the pavement.
Accommodation underbridges
4.16
Headroom for accommodation underbridges shall be agreed with the landowners and expected users
of the structure and recorded in a legally enforceable agreement.
4.16.1
The headroom at accommodation bridges should be derived from the following criteria:
1) the likely methods of farming in the area;
2) the size of the agricultural and maintenance vehicles expected to use the bridge;
3) the use of the bridge by walking, cycling, and horse-riding users;
4) the use of the bridge for animal access.
NOTE
The maximum height of an agricultural vehicle can be up to 4.65 metres except those transporting
agricultural baled produce (i.e. hay, silage straw, or animal fodder) which have no height limit.
Walking, cycling, and horse-riding users
4.17
For new structures the minimum headroom given in CD 143 [Ref 6.N] shall be increased by 300mm
where there is a risk for a reduction of the headroom.
NOTE 1
A future overlay of the road pavement can result in a reduction of the subway's headroom.
NOTE 2
Minimum headroom for subways and structures that are used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders is in
accordance with the requirements of CD 143 [Ref 6.N].
4.18
Headrooms for structures outside the scope of CD 143 [Ref 6.N] shall adopt the headroom
requirements in CD 143 [Ref 6.N] where facilities for walking, cycling or horse-riding are provided.
4.18.1
Where more than one headroom is quoted in CD 143 [Ref 6.N] due to different widths along the length
of the structure, the maximum headroom should be adopted.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex (NAA) gives the Highways England specific requirements and
additional relaxations relating to cross sections and headrooms for:
1) modifying existing motorways where motorway regulations apply (herein referred to as 'existing
motorways');
2) modifying existing all-purpose dual carriageways; and
3) smart motorways
The additional relaxations included in this NAA allow greater flexibility when dealing with the constraints
associated with enhancing elements of existing motorways and all-purpose trunk roads.
This NAA is to be used in conjunction with CD 127 [Ref 1.N], GD 300 [Ref 6.N] and IAN 161 [Ref 9.N]
where appropriate.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

The width of the nearside verge can be reduced as required as long as the resultant width can
accommodate both underground and over-ground equipment, including emergency roadside
telephones.
NOTE 2
Document TD 131 [Ref 8.N] provides further requirements and advice for situations where the verge
width is reduced in accordance with Table E/1.4 and emergency roadside telephones are provided.
E/1.5
Where a 600mm raised verge is provided on an underbridge, the raised verge width shall be excluded
from the measurement of the hard shoulder.
E/1.5.1
The 600mm raised verge provided on an underbridge may be included in the measurement of an
emergency access width.
E/1.6
Where it is proposed to reduce the central reserve (including hard strips) to 3.40 metres or less, the
Overseeing Organisation shall be consulted to ensure that any implications on maintenance activities
have been considered and any potential issues resolved.
E/1.7
Where resultant wheel tracks from altered lane widths are within 100mm of existing pavement joints,
the maintaining organisation shall be consulted to ensure that any implications on maintenance have
been considered and any potential issues resolved.
E/1.8
Where it is proposed to reduce the hard shoulder below 3.00 metres the emergency services shall be
consulted to ensure that any implications on their activities have been considered and any potential
issues resolved.
E/1.9
Where verge widths at structures are reduced to zero the maintaining organisation and emergency
services shall be consulted to ensure that any implications on maintenance activities and the potential
impact on the occupants of stricken vehicles have been considered and any potential issues resolved.
E/1.10
When applying the cross-section relaxations identified in Table E/1.4, no lane lines shall taper at
gradients steeper than 1:100 when transitioning from one cross-section to another.
E/1.11
The central reserve width as identified in Table E/1.4 shall accommodate the working widths of the
vehicle restraint system (VRS) and any equipment that is present or proposed.

motorway to a smart motorway.
E/3.2
Where a new junction is proposed as part of a smart motorway, the parameters given in Section E/3
shall not be used to design the new elements of that junction e.g. the slip roads.
Geometric parameters
Verges, edge detail and omission of hard shoulder (CD 127 clauses 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, and
2.23)
E/3.3
Where there is no nearside edge restraint, such as a kerb or drainage channel, nearside hard strips
shall be provided in accordance with Table E/3.3.

Where an edge restraint is provided, such as a kerb or drainage channel for example, there is no
requirement for a nearside or offside hard strip.
E/3.5
If a drainage channel is provided adjacent to a concrete carriageway the drainage channel shall be tied
to the carriageway pavement.
E/3.5.1
Any additional pavement width available should be allocated to the provision of a nearside hard strip
(where it is sub-standard or where one is not provided) rather than increasing the all lane running (ALR)
lane widths above the dimensions given in Table E/3.10.
E/3.5.2
Mainline hard shoulders may be omitted on smart motorways.
E/3.5.3
The design should avoid paved areas in the verge that encourage road users to stop illegally.

than 1.50 metres and less than 3.00 metres wide it should be marked with a hatched road marking.
E/3.6
Hatched road markings in the emergency access / hard strip shall only be used when endorsed by the
SCRG.
NOTE
Where ALR is utilised, the requirement to hatch an emergency access width / hard strip does not apply
where a hard shoulder has been converted into a running lane and a hard strip is also provided due to
the available cross section.
E/3.7
Where a hard shoulder is present on a merge connector road, this shall be hatched where the width
drops below 3.00 metres.
E/3.7.1
The hatching on hard shoulders below 3.00 metres wide on merge connector roads should terminate at
the entry datum point in accordance with CD 122 [Ref 3.N].
E/3.8
Where a hard shoulder is present on a diverge connector road, the hard shoulder shall be hatched
where the width drops below 3.00 metres.

Where compliant hard strips are provided in accordance with CD 127 [Ref 1.N], the hierarchy for
increasing lane widths above the dimensions shown in Table E/3.10 shall be to allocate additional width
to lane 2, then lane 3 and finally lane 4.
E/3.11.1
The impact on the joints in both the surface and the binder course from the movement of wheel tracks
should be addressed in the design.
NOTE 1
Relocating the lane lines (without carriageway resurfacing) can result in the proposed wheel tracks
moving over the existing longitudinal joints in the final solution.
NOTE 2
When considering the impact of wheel tracks on longitudinal joints for lane widths below 3.65 metres,
wheel track zones can be assumed to be 600mm wide at 2050mm centres, centred in the lane.
Central reserves
E/3.12
Where it is proposed to reduce the central reserve (including hard strips) to 3.40 metres or less, the
maintaining organisation shall be consulted to ensure that any implications on maintenance activities
have been considered and any potential issues resolved.
E/3.13
Central reserve widths shall be wide enough to accommodate any relevant equipment, the working
widths for the VRS and be no less that 2.60 metres wide including hard strips.
E/3.14
The use of unbound materials in the central reserve shall only be proposed when it has been endorsed
by the SCRG.
E/3.14.1
Where works are undertaken in the central reserve, the use of unbound material as the surface
treatment should be avoided.
E/3.14.2
Where unbound material is used in the central reserve, the material should be stabilised in accordance
with CD 525 [Ref 2.N].
Vehicle restraint system set back
E/3.15
The set-back to a VRS shall be measured as the lateral distance between the traffic face of a safety
barrier and:
1) nearside:
a) the back of the nearside hard strip (when it is greater than 600mm) or hard shoulder;
b) the kerb face for roads without a nearside hard strip (or hard strip less than 600mm) or without
hard shoulder;
c) the trafficked edge of the edge line for roads without a hard strip (or hard strip less than 600mm),
or without hard shoulder or kerb;
2) offside:

could be difficult to provide the minimum set-back value.
Note 3. Relaxation to 450mm is permitted where it is considered necessary to position the VRS away
from the edge of an existing embankment in order to provide support to the foundation.
Note 4. Relaxation to 1.00 metre is permitted where space is limited for extended lengths.
E/3.16.1
Set-back dimensions greater than the minimum values given in Table E/3.16 should be provided
wherever practicable on smart motorways.
E/3.17
The relaxations in set-back identified in Table E/3.16 shall not be applied if they create non-compliant
stopping sight distance in accordance with CD 109 [Ref 4.N].
E/3.18
For the purposes of measurement of set-back, an emergency area shall be treated as a hard shoulder.
