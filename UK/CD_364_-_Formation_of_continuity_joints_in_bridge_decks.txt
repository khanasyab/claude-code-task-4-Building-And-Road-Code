2. Deck widening design
2.
Deck widening design
General requirements
2.1
A widened concrete bridge deck shall be monolithic without any permanent longitudinal joints or gaps.
2.2
A scheme for a concrete bridge deck widening using continuity joints shall be designed for the following:
1)
the effects of vibrations from traffic between the existing and new parts of the deck;
2)
the effects of differential vertical deflection between the existing and new parts of the deck; and
3)
the effects of temporary propping if proposed.
2.2.1
The concrete bridge deck widening may be achieved by:
1)
construction of a new part of the deck which is attached directly to the existing trafficked deck; or
2)
construction of a separate parallel deck followed by an in-fill strip as a second stage (in-fill strip
method).
NOTE 1
The in-fill strip method can be used to mitigate potential defects caused by differential deflections and
vibrations.
NOTE 2
The decision on the method of a concrete deck widening is influenced by design constraints and
structural implications including traffic volume, composition, and speed, together with traffic-induced
vibrations and differential deflections while the concrete matures. Guidance is given in ACI 345.2 R-13
[Ref 2.I].
2.2.2
Where the differential deflection and vibration limits set out in the following clauses are measured,
anticipated or calculated as being exceeded, the design may include a dynamic analysis of the
combined structure using the properties of immature concrete to determine the effects of traffic-induced
vibrations and deflections.
2.3
Where the in-fill strip method is used, the design drawings shall state that the in-fill strip is not to be
constructed until the first phase deck concrete has achieved the specified characteristic strength, or at
least 14 days after placement, whichever is the latter.
2.3.1
The in-fill strip may be supported using temporary transverse supports spanning from the existing deck.
2.4
The design drawings shall clearly state any constraints on the construction of the deck widening.
NOTE
The constraints on the construction of the deck widening can include:
1)
traffic speed;
2)
weight restrictions;
3)
phasing of demolition and construction;
4)
temporary vehicle restraint system; and
5)
any additional temporary works or supports.
Control of deflection
2.5
The design for the concrete deck widening shall include the effects of differential deflection between the
new and existing parts of the deck before the new concrete achieves the specified characteristic
strength.
2.6
The differential deflection between the new and existing parts of the deck at the interface shall be
limited to the following until the concrete achieves the specified characteristic strength, or at least 7
days after placement, whichever is the latter:
1)
6 mm due to the weight of fresh concrete when the concrete for the new part of the deck is
poured; and
2)
1 mm due to traffic actions.

CD 364 Version 0.0.1
2. Deck widening design
NOTE
The differential deflection between the new and existing parts of the deck is influenced by:
1)
the development of the immature concrete strength in the new part of the deck;
2)
the elastic modulus of the immature concrete;
3)
traffic on the existing deck; and
4)
the sequence of formwork removal.
2.6.1
Where the new and existing parts of the deck are of dissimilar construction forms and have different
stiffnesses, the relative deflection characteristics of the existing and new parts of the deck should be
taken into account.
NOTE
The relative deflection characteristics of dissimilar existing and new parts of the deck can be used to
inform the predictive methods of calculating differential deflection.
2.6.2
Differential deflection may be limited by designing the new part of the deck in a similar manner as the
existing part, by using temporary propping or by using the in-fill strip method.
2.7
The design drawings shall state that the formwork is removed after the concrete achieves the specified
characteristic strength, or at least 7 days after placement, whichever is the latter.
NOTE
Early removal of formwork leads to a higher initial deflection in the new part of the deck prior to the
concrete maturing.
2.8
Predictive methods of calculating deflection shall be verified by measurement and monitoring in the
following situations until the concrete achieves the specified characteristic strength, or at least 7 days
after placement, whichever is the latter:
1)
deck widening by attaching a new part of the deck directly to the existing trafficked deck;
2)
deck widening using the in-fill strip method with traffic running less than 1 m to the interface.
Control of vibration
2.9
Measures to protect the new part of the deck from the effects of vibrations until the new concrete
achieves the specified characteristic strength shall be included in the design.
NOTE
Vibration in the freshly placed concrete can result in reduced anchorage bond due to the reinforcement
moving relative to the immature concrete, causing cracks in the concrete which can be filled with weak
diluted grout.
2.9.1
Measures to protect the new part of the deck from the effects of vibrations may include:
1)
temporary propping to the trafficked deck; and
2)
keeping formwork independent from the trafficked deck.
2.10
Traffic-induced vibrations at the interface of the deck widening shall be limited to a peak particle
velocity of 5 mm/s until the concrete achieves the specified characteristic strength, or at least 7 days
after placement, whichever is the latter.
2.10.1
The peak particle velocity of the existing deck may be determined by:
1)
monitoring the vibrations caused by traffic prior to construction commencing; or
2)
undertaking a dynamic analysis on the structure.
NOTE
The measured peak particle velocity of the structure provides an indication of damage risk to immature
concrete due to transmitted vibrations.
2.11
Predictive methods of calculating vibrations shall be verified by measurement and monitoring, until the
concrete achieves the specified characteristic strength, or at least 7 days after placement, whichever is
the latter.

2. Deck widening design
Concrete mix design
2.12
Concrete mixes shall be specified to avoid segregation caused by traffic induced vibrations during the
period of setting and early strength development.
NOTE
High slump concrete mixes are prone to bleeding and segregation when exposed to traffic induced
vibrations, which can result in lower bond and compressive strengths.
2.13
Concrete slump for the construction of the new part of the deck shall be specified to a maximum slump
limit of 100 mm for pumped or placed mixes.
NOTE
The 100 mm limit on concrete slump is taken from ACI 345.2 R-13 [Ref 2.I].
2.13.1
Concrete mixes with slump between 25 mm to 50 mm should be used as they are less prone to
bleeding and segregation.
Reinforcement details
2.14
Reinforcement shall be continuous across the continuity joint.
2.14.1
Continuity of reinforcement may be achieved either by full lap lengths in accordance with BS EN
1992-2 [Ref 1.N], or by use of reinforcement couplers in accordance with CC 482 [Ref 3.I].
2.14.2
Continuity of reinforcement may be achieved by specifying drill and fixed starter bars in accordance
with CD 372 [Ref 1.I] where the vibration at the interface does not exceed the peak particle velocity of 5
mm/s.
2.15
Design drawings of the deck widening shall clearly require that:
1)
existing deck concrete is removed to expose the length of existing reinforcement required to
make a continuous connection;
2)
the removal of existing deck concrete does not damage the existing reinforcement; and
3)
the reinforcement within the in-fill strip is tied securely at all bar intersections.
2.16
For the in-fill strip method, the reinforcement of the existing deck shall not extend beyond the in-fill strip
to lap with new reinforcement.
