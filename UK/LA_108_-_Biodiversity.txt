1) great age;
2) size;
3) condition;
4) biodiversity value as a result of significant wood decay and
the habitat created from the ageing process;
5) cultural and heritage value.

Any area that's been wooded continuously since at least 1600
AD, or a date otherwise specified by the Overseeing
Organisation including:
1) ancient semi-natural woodland mainly made up of trees and
shrubs native to the site, usually arising from natural
regeneration plantations on ancient woodland sites;
2) replanted with conifer or broad-leaved trees that retain
ancient woodland features, such as undisturbed soil, ground
flora and fungi;
3) wood pastures identified as ancient;
4) historic parkland, which is protected as a heritage asset in the
relevant planning policy.
Biodiversity
The variability among living organisms from all sources, including
terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the
ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes
diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems
CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].
Biodiversity resources
Ecological receptors that are present in the surrounding
environment.
Critical phase of a species life
cycle

Element(s)
Parts of environmental factors.
NOTE: For biodiversity, these are: sites, habitats, and species.
Enhancement
Enhancement is improved management of a biodiversity
resource or provision of new ecological features, resulting in a
net benefit to biodiversity, which is unrelated to a negative impact
or is 'over and above' that required to mitigate/compensate for an
impact CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].
Environmental net gain
An approach to development that aims to leave the natural
environment in a measurably better state DEFRA Net Gain [Ref
1.I].
Habitat
The place or type of site where an organism or population
naturally occurs. Often used in the wider sense referring to major
assemblages of plants and animals found together CIEEM
(Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].
Priority habitats and species
Those species and habitats which are defined in CIEEM's
Guidelines for Preliminary Ecological Appraisal CIEEM
(Preliminaries) [Ref 12.N] as:
1) listed as a national priority for conservation (such as those
listed as habitats and species of principal importance for the
conservation of biodiversity);
2) listed as a local priority for conservation, for example in the
relevant local Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP);
3) Red Listed using International Union for the Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) criteria or, where a more recent assessment of
the taxonomic group has not yet been undertaken, listed in a
Red Data Book;
4) listed as Near Threatened or Amber Listed;
5) listed as a Nationally Rare or Nationally Scarce species or
listed as a Nationally Notable species where a more recent
assessment of the taxonomic group has not yet been
undertaken; and/or
6) endemic to a country or geographic location.
Significant effect
An effect that either supports or undermines biodiversity
conservation objectives for biodiversity resources or for
biodiversity in general e.g. impacts on structure and function of
defined sites, habitats, or species and the conservation status of
habitats and species (including extent, abundance and
distribution) CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].
Veteran trees
A tree that has decay features, such as branch death or hollowing
which contribute to its biodiversity, cultural and heritage value.
NOTE: All ancient trees are veteran trees, but not all veteran
trees are ancient.
Zone of influence
The area(s) over which biodiversity resources can be affected by
biophysical changes as a result of the proposed project and
associated activities CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].

3. Assessment methodology
3.
Assessment methodology
Scoping
3.1
The scoping assessment shall identify and report on:
1) an initial understanding of baseline ecological conditions and the likely ecological constraints;
2) the opportunities for environmental enhancements including those that support environmental net
gain, where applicable;
3) any mitigation measures likely to be required, following the 'mitigation hierarchy' LA 104 [Ref 8.N];
4) the zone of influence of the project and which important biodiversity resources could be significantly
affected;
5) the potential for significant effects (including likely nature and scale) on biodiversity resources from
the project;
6) further assessments, including any additional surveys, and the associated methods and related
evaluation or significance criteria required to inform the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA).
3.1.1
The scoping assessment should report on the baseline, including any desk study and walkover surveys
undertaken in accordance with LD 118 [Ref 3.N].
3.1.2
The scoping assessment should make recommendations on the scope of further assessment.
NOTE
Further assessment includes additional surveys of sites, species or habitats with complex or extensive
survey standard.
3.2
The scoping assessment shall identify potential significant effects by answering the following questions
to gain an understanding of the need to undertake further assessment:
1) is the project likely to impact designated sites (statutory or non statutory)?;
2) is the project likely to impact protected or priority habitats?;
3) is the project likely to impact protected or priority species?;
4) is the project likely to impact the function or quality of habitats?;
5) is the project likely to impact the conservation status of habitats and species?
3.3
Where the response to one or more of the scoping assessment questions is 'yes', further assessment
shall be undertaken.
3.3.1
Where there is uncertainty or it is not possible to robustly justify a conclusion of no potential significant
effects, further assessment should be undertaken.
3.3.2
Where the response to all scoping assessment questions is 'no', biodiversity should be scoped out of
further assessment and the justification for scoping out reported.
NOTE
In some situations it can be appropriate for projects to scope out elements of the biodiversity
assessment, e.g. sites can be scoped out if there are none located in the study area.
Study area
3.4
The study area shall be identified and reported, based on the:
1) project boundary including any off-site ancillary works or areas;
2) construction footprint, including potential construction compounds, haul routes, borrow pits and
temporary land take;
3) project's zone of influence on biodiversity resource.
3.4.1
The zones of influence vary and should be established for each biodiversity resource.
3.5
The study area shall incorporate all areas where significant effects could occur throughout the life of the
project.

LA 108 Revision 1
3. Assessment methodology
3.5.1
The study area and zone of influences should be reviewed and refined during the project life-cycle as
the baseline information is updated and the project design develops.
Baseline scenario
3.6
The biodiversity baseline of the study area shall be established and reported in the scoping and
environmental assessment reports.
3.6.1
The ecological baseline should report in accordance with LA 104 [Ref 8.N] on:
1) current baseline at the time of the survey; and
2) the future baseline at the time of the project proceeding.
3.7
The scoping and environmental assessment reports shall include the influence, on the biodiversity
baseline of the study area of other development projects that have been consented or recently
constructed.
3.8
Baseline information shall be established from a range of appropriate data sources including:
1) desk studies;
2) ecological surveys undertaken in line with LD 118 [Ref 3.N].
NOTE
Appropriate desk study data sources can include local record centres, non-statutory bodies such as
Wildlife Trusts, and existing planning applications.
3.8.1
Collation of the biodiversity baseline should assure the age, validity, and relevance of the data available.
NOTE
Guidance on the age of ecological data can be found in relevant advice notes including CIEEM (2019)
CIEEM (survey lifespan) [Ref 1.N].
3.9
Baseline studies shall establish the relative importance of the biodiversity resources using the guidance
in Table 3.9.

3. Assessment methodology
3.11.1
Projects should conclude the level of impact on biodiversity resources in accordance with CIEEM's
Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment for the UK and Ireland CIEEM (Guidelines) [Ref 11.N].
3.11.2
The level of impact should be informed by the outcomes of the modelling and assessment of other
environmental factors (where relevant) including air quality LA 105 [Ref 2.N] and noise and vibration LA
111 [Ref 16.N].
NOTE
Damage to a resources can be wide-ranging and can include disturbance, pollution, compaction of
soils or changes to the systems on which habitats, species and sites depend.
3.12
The environmental assessment shall describe any likely significant effects of the project on biodiversity
resources.
3.13
The importance of the resource (identified in Table 3.9) and level impact (identified in Table 3.11) shall
be used to determine the significance of effect based on Table 3.13 and the principles of LA 104 [Ref
8.N].

LA 108 Revision 1
3. Assessment methodology
NOTE
Significant effects typically comprise effects that remain within the moderate, large or very large
categories once mitigation has been taken into account.
3.13.1
Where Table 3.13 includes two significance categories, evidence should be provided to support the
reporting of a single significance category.
3.13.2
Improvements from baseline conditions (beneficial effects) should be identified and reported within
environmental assessments.
Design and mitigation
3.14
The design and mitigation hierarchy outlined in LA 104 [Ref 8.N] shall be applied to avoid, reduce and
remediate adverse effects on biodiversity resources.
3.14.1
Where a residual effect continues to be significant, the design and mitigation hierarchy outlined within
LA 104 [Ref 8.N] should be re-applied to reduce effects further.
3.14.2
Measures to avoid, reduce, and remediate effects should address specific adverse effects and reflect
the nature, magnitude and duration of the effect.
NOTE
Early and ongoing engagement between design engineers and environmental assessment
professionals is an effective way of eliminating and reducing impacts on the project on biodiversity
resources, thereby reducing the need for additional / subsequent design and mitigation measures.
3.15
The development of biodiversity design and mitigation measures shall follow the principles outlined in
LD 118 [Ref 3.N].
3.16
The implementation of biodiversity design and mitigation measures shall follow the principles outlined
in LA 120 [Ref 9.N].
Environmental enhancement
3.17
In line with LA 104 [Ref 8.N], the biodiversity assessment process shall identify enhancement
opportunities as an integral part of project design for improving, reconstructing, and/or restoring the
biodiversity resources.
Reporting of environmental assessments
3.18
Reporting of the assessment of biodiversity resources shall be undertaken in line with the principles in
LA 104 [Ref 8.N].
3.18.1
Reporting at each stage of the assessment should include information on any assumptions or
limitations that the report is based on.
NOTE
Assumptions and limitations can include information on any gaps in data or any assumptions on
mitigation. This can be particularly important when projects are at early stages in the design processes.
3.18.2
Information from the assessment of biodiversity resources should be made available, in a suitable
format, to the wider project team and considered during project development.
NOTE
Information to be shared can include the location of designated sites in proximity to the project and the
results of ecological surveys.
3.18.3
The sensitivity of biodiversity resources information should be identified in the reporting and sharing of
biodiversity assessments.
NOTE
Some species data can have restrictions on publication due to data sensitivity and the potential for
unlawful activity associated with the disclosure of location data.
Assessment and reporting process
3.19
The design and assessment shall follow the process illustrated in Figure 3.19.
