CD 378 replaces TD 49/07. This full document has been re-written to make it
compliant with the new Highways England drafting rules and to add reference
to the newer American guidelines (MASH). The update also introduces
additional minimum reporting requirements for the UK tests as a guide to test
houses and to ensure a level of consistency in reporting. This document only
considers the testing of TMAs, not how they are implemented - this is still
covered by Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual.

Assessment criteria
Test pass/fail criteria
4.1
Elements of the TMA shall not penetrate the passenger compartment of the impacting vehicle.
4.2
There shall be no deformations of, or intrusions into, the passenger compartment of the impacting
vehicle that can cause serious injuries to the occupants.
4.3

4.4
The impacting vehicle shall remain upright during and after collision.
4.5
The maximum roll and pitch angles of the impacting vehicle shall not exceed 75 degrees.
4.6
After a head-on centre test (approach 50 or 51), the impacting vehicle's post impact trajectory shall not
cross either of the exit box lines detailed in clause 2.17 (Test site sub section, Section 2).
Severity indices
4.7
For all tests, the severity indexes ASI and THIV shall be computed using the vehicle instrumentation
and calculation procedure contained in BS EN 1317-1 [Ref 7.N].
4.8
The maximum value of ASI shall be reported in the test report to one decimal place.
4.9
The maximum value of THIV shall be reported in the test report with no decimals.
4.10
For tests conducted to NCHRP 350 [Ref 5.N], MASH 09 [Ref 4.N] or MASH 16 [Ref 3.N], the Occupant
Ridedown Acceleration (ORA) and Occupant Impact Velocity (OIV) shall also be calculated in
accordance with the requirements of the standard to which the TMA was tested.
4.11

5.
Durability
5.1
A declaration of the working life for the system shall be obtained from the manufacturer.
NOTE 1
An appropriate measurement of durability could be the in-service inspection of a TMA.
NOTE 2
The working life of an TMA depends upon its inherent durability and the prevailing environmental
conditions.
5.2
A clear distinction shall be made between the (declared) working life for a product, based on the
assessment of durability in technical specifications, and the actual working life of a product.
NOTE
The actual working life of a product depends on many factors beyond the control of the manufacturer,
such as installation design, environmental location, handling, use, and maintenance.
5.3
A list of the materials and protective coatings used on the TMA shall be obtained from the manufacturer.
NOTE
The list of materials and protective coatings enables the validity of the declared working life to be
assessed.
5.4
An assessment of durability (including the identification of technical characteristics of materials
affecting durability, and the methods of evaluation) shall be obtained from the manufacturer.
