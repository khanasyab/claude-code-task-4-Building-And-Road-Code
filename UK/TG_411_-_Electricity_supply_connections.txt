Introduction
Introduction
Background
This National Application Annex gives the National Highways-specific requirements for electricity
supply connections (exit points) for roadside equipment. The Road Investment Strategy programmes
(RIS1 & 2) have resulted in an increase in the number of major schemes being designed and delivered
on behalf of National Highways. It is necessary to clarify the regulations and guidance that direct what
types of electricity supply connections are offered by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), what
preferences National Highways has for those connections and the expectation National Highways has
for its delivery partners to liaise with the DNOs to request the types of connections that National
Highways prefers wherever possible.
National Highways' preference is for unmetered supply (UMS) for technology and lighting assets
wherever possible. This is for two reasons; firstly for safety reasons as meters, even smart meters,
have to be maintained, repaired and manually read periodically and their location on or near to the
motorway and trunk road network could present significant risk to staff who carry out these tasks and
are likely to require traffic management in order to allow access to the meters. Secondly metered
supplies tend to be more expensive over the life of the supply when compared to UMS, particularly
where the consumption is modest, as is the case for most technology and lighting installations.
The requirements have been created to ensure National Highways correctly accounts for the
consumption of all roadside electrical equipment connected to its network in order to produce accurate
electricity billing information and complies with National Highways electricity connections and supplies
contracts.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.

E/1. General requirements
E/1.
General requirements
E/1.1
All unmetered electricity supply connections must comply with the Electricity (Unmetered Supply)
Regulations 2001 SI 2001 No. 3263 [Ref 4.N] .
NOTE
The criteria stated in the Electricity (Unmetered Supply) Regulations 2001 SI 2001 No. 3263 [Ref 4.N]
for whether a supply can be UMS can be summarised as follows: the load is of a predictable nature
and either less than 500 W or it is impractical for the supply to be metered either technically, financially
or for legal reasons.
E/1.2
Where UMS equipment is installed on motorways and all-purpose trunk roads, the Unmetered Supplies
(UMS) Procedures BSCP 520 [Ref 5.N] shall be complied with.
E/1.2.1
Electricity supply connections to technology and lighting assets should be UMS.
NOTE
Many DNOs offer UMS for supplies exceeding 500 W. It is not uncommon for UMS supplies of between
2 kW and 5 kW or higher where equipment consumption is of a predictable nature. Ultimately the DNO
decide what type of supply they offer, metered or UMS, in accordance with DNO policy.
E/1.2.2
The electricity connection application should not pre-empt the decision made by the DNO.
NOTE
The primary driver for UMS is the predictability of load, so whilst the UMS regulation SI 2001 No. 3263
[Ref 4.N] quantifies an upper limit of 500 Watts the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) Guidance SI 2001/3263 (Guidance) [Ref 1.N] recognises that it is not always practical
or financially viable to meter supplies and the cost of metering could considerably outweigh the value of
the electricity consumed. BEIS encourage all DNOs to consider the cost and practicality of metering.
BEIS state that they "believe there is sufficient scope for them [the Regulations] to be interpreted in a
pragmatic way" when deciding whether a supply might be metered or UMS.
E/1.3
Where an application is made for a connection for a National Highways scheme, the application form
shall state that this is a National Highways project.
NOTE
For example; in the "name of appointed supplier" field in the application the format is: [nominated
electricity supplier company name] EDF – National Highways national contract – unmetered lighting –
MPAN 1234567891011.
E/1.4
The distribution network operator (DNO) UMS connection agreement shall be complied within each
DNO area.
E/1.5
Where there is no DNO agreement, the National Terms of Connection www.connectionterms.co.uk [Ref
3.N] shall be complied with.
E/1.6
Following installation, commissioning, replacement or removal of roadside lighting or technology
assets, the relevant National Highways asset database shall be updated within 12 weeks of the
commissioning of equipment on the motorway and trunk road network.
E/1.7
Electricity supplies for street lighting and technology equipment shall be kept separate at all times.
Elexon charge codes for UMS
E/1.8
All lighting assets shall be assigned the correct Elexon switch regimes/control codes in order to qualify
for UMS.
E/1.8.1
Where charge codes are provided and the DNO insists on a metered supply being installed, advice
should be obtained by contacting the National Highways Electricity Connections Manager or Energy
Procurement Team (see Appendix E/A).
NOTE
Details of how to apply for Elexon charge codes can be found on the Elexon website Elexon [Ref 1.I] .
E/1.9
Charge codes that are not available for technology equipment at the point of scheme design shall be
sought from the manufacturers prior to commissioning.
E/1.9.1
Before the charge codes are available it can be possible to add the equipment to the technology
equipment UMS inventories using the load Watts (dim, bright & quiescent) together with the operating
hours. Advice should be obtained by contacting the National Highways Energy Procurement Team.

E/1. General requirements
NOTE
Not having charge codes at the design stage of a scheme is not a reason to apply for a metered supply.
Existing electricity supplies
E/1.10
Existing exit points in stalled before the publication of the Electricity (Unmetered Supply) Regulations
(2001) SI 2001 No. 3263 [Ref 4.N] shall be classed as legacy equipment and retain UMS status.
NOTE
Where additional load is requested at an existing UMS exit point, the DNO can require a meter to be
fitted retrospectively due to a change of use.
E/1.11
Where the addition of extra UMS equipment to an unmetered exit point is permitted by the DNO, the
existing MPAN shall be supplied in the DNO connections section of the application form.
E/1.12
The electricity consumption (load) of equipment connected to existing metered exit points shall be
measured by the existing meter or by the new meter if an upgrade is required to support the additional
load.
E/1.12.1
Where a new energy supplier is selected and a new meter installed, the National Highways Energy
Procurement Team should be contacted for advice.
E/1.13
Where the attributes of the supply (such as UMS / metered / capacity) change before or during the
process of applying to the DNO for a new exit point, the National Highways-nominated electricity
supplier shall be reviewed and updated to reflect this change.
Nominated electricity suppliers
E/1.14
National Highways-approved electricity suppliers shall be nominated for the supply of electricity to
roadside equipment in accordance with Table E/1.14.

in a manner compatible with the risk transfer principles in the specific contract.
E/1.16
Any changes to the procedural and process requirements and guidance made to implement DBFO
contracts shall be subject to the agreement of the Department's Nominee / Department's
Representative through the appropriate change or review procedure in the contract.
