Introduction
Introduction
Background
The purpose of this document is to present a common procedure for estimating the whole-life cost of
alternative designs or maintenance interventions and to give a client an estimate of the cost of
ownership of an asset throughout its life. It should also provide a basis for the management of the
asset and planning of maintenance activities.
There has been much development in the understanding of deterioration modelling and the use of
life-cycle plans for good asset management since the publication of BD 36/92 and BA 28/92. For the
case of new or substantially altered structures this document outlines the methods to be adopted to
evaluate the life-cycle costs of different options and the production of a life-cycle management plan for
the adopted solution. In the case of maintenance interventions a similar approach is outlined, with the
aim of considering the effect of different intervention options on the whole life cost of the asset. It is
intended that these can be reviewed and updated throughout the life of the asset, following a principal
inspection.
Assumptions made in the preparation of the document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
References in this document to BS EN documents include their UK National Annexes and all
associated Published Documents (PDs).
Mutual Recognition
Where there is a requirement in this document for compliance with any part of a British Standard or
other technical specification, that requirement may be met by compliance with the mutual recognition
clause in GG 101 [Ref 2.N].

Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
This document shall be used in the design development stage for new permanent structural assets and
the options appraisal of maintenance schemes or alterations to existing permanent structural assets.
1.1.1
This document should be used at other times during a structure's life-cycle to assist in whole life asset
management.
Implementation
1.2
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the whole-life costs analysis at
the design development stage of new structures, and the design of maintenance interventions on the
Overseeing Organisation's motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according to the implementation
requirements of GG 101 [Ref 2.N].
1.3
The lowest whole life cost option shall become the recommended solution in an options report, except
where other factors override that selection.
NOTE
Whole life costs are just one indicator of the most sustainable solution, a full evaluation of which could
encompass technical, environmental, social and economic objectives. Each of the alternative options
appraised according to this standard is likely to differ in ranking when ordered by either their initial cost
or their whole life cost. Whilst the lowest whole life cost option is generally to be preferred, aspects
other than costs can be a significant factor in selection.
1.4
In those cases where an alternative to the lowest whole life cost option is to be recommended, a report
summarising the implications of each of the alternatives and justification for the proposed
recommendation shall be provided to the Overseeing Organisation.
1.4.1
An options report should include the valuation and summary of the alternative options, and justification
for the proposed recommendation.
Use of GG 101
1.5
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.

2. Evaluation procedure
2.
Evaluation procedure
2.1
The preferred scheme solution shall be determined by an appraisal following the procedure outlined
below in clauses 2.2 to 2.9.
2.2
The valid design or maintenance options shall be established.
2.2.1
Design options should allow for the replacement of elements such as bearings and joints in a
cost-effective way that will not cause undue disruption to traffic.
2.2.2
Design options should anticipate large scale refurbishment of bridge structures at some stage in their
life and avoid designs which would prevent this being undertaken efficiently, e.g. it is recommended
that details which would prevent contraflow traffic arrangements being implemented are avoided.
2.3
Anticipated activities for the construction, inspection, routine maintenance, and interventions on the
structure for each of the options identified shall be determined for the full evaluation period.
2.4
The timing and duration of each of the anticipated activities for each of the options shall be estimated.
2.5
Construction costs of each alternative and the costs associated with each of the activities identified
above shall be estimated using current cost data.
2.6
The cost of traffic management and user delays for all of the activities identified above shall be
estimated.
NOTE
For information on user delay costs see section 3.
2.6.1
Where the structure works are part of a larger scheme, some costs should be shared between different
assets, and only structure's proportion should be included in the evaluation.
2.7
The present value of all costs for each option shall be calculated, using discount factors for expenditure
in the future; this will in effect generate a life-cycle management plan for each option.
NOTE
Evaluating activities and calculating their costs can, in effect, generate a life-cycle management plan
for each option.
2.8
The initial and life-cycle costs of the options shall be compared to determine the optimal cost-effective
solution.
2.9
The life-cycle management plan for the recommended solution shall be stored with the design
documentation for the structure.
2.9.1
The findings of the initial and life cycle cost comparison should be presented to the Overseeing
Organisation for a decision on the recommendation.
2.9.2
Where the options provide other, non-costed, benefits such as providing different levels of service then
these should be clearly stated, especially if the most cost-effective solution is not being recommended.
2.9.3
The life-cycle plan should be reviewed and amended with relevant as-built information and, upon
completion on site, stored with the structures records in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's
data and record requirements.
NOTE
For an example of the evaluation procedure see Appendix B.
2.10
The activities that shall be included in the appraisal are those that can be expected to be required
during the life of the asset, including:
1) construction of the asset or the maintenance intervention;
2) routine maintenance of the asset;
3) undertaking general, principal and special Inspections;
4) repair and renewal of protective systems to elements;
5) repair and renewal of concrete elements especially in areas of severe exposure;
6) replacement of bearings, joints and other limited life elements;

2. Evaluation procedure
7) other future maintenance interventions.
NOTE
Future maintenance interventions vary depending upon the form of the structure, materials used,
construction details, exposure, and the quality of construction.
2.11
The costs associated with each of the activities shall be estimated using cost data current at the time of
the appraisal.
NOTE
The accuracy of the cost information can vary, with the costs of the construction or intervention options
that are being considered being well defined. The estimates of future interventions can be based on
experience and any available research or guidance on deterioration prediction.
2.12
Where scheme options have different land or access requirements then the costs of this shall be
included.
2.13
The 'present value' of all of the costs identified shall be calculated using discount factors applied to
future costs.
2.14
The discounting of future costs shall be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of HM
Treasury 'Green Book' [Ref 1.N].
2.14.1
The discount rates that should be applied are currently contained in the 'Green Book' published by HM
Treasury [Ref 1.N]; this also contains details of how the rates are applied.
2.15
The life-cycle management plans shall be split into annual intervals and activities with associated costs
inserted in the year in which they are anticipated to be required.
2.16
The 'present value' of each of the costs shall be calculated using the discount factor for the year in
which they are anticipated to occur.
2.17
The present values shall be totalled for each of the scheme options.
2.17.1
Where the most effective solution in terms of whole life costs is not recommended the reasons for this
should be clearly stated at the time of making the recommendation.
NOTE
In some cases there can be compelling reasons why the most cost-effective solution cannot be
recommended for implementation and these can be due to limited initial budget or other reasons such
as aesthetic or political factors.
2.17.2
Where any such reason exists, it should be taken into consideration when shortlisting the valid options.
2.18
In all cases evidence shall be provided to support the assertions made in the life-cycle management
plans.
2.18.1
Evidence may be guidance produced by recognised bodies, research, or experience on the
performance of materials or elements in the situation in which they are to be exposed.
NOTE
Bodies such as TRL (Transport Research Laboratory), CIRIA ( Construction Information Research and
Information Association), The Concrete Society, and Steel Construction Institute publish relevant
guidance.
Changes to life-cycle plan
2.19
The life-cycle plan of the recommended solution shall be updated with any changes that occur during
detailed design that affect the whole life cost of the solution.
2.20
Where significant changes are proposed which increase costs, then these shall be subjected to an
analysis of the effects of the proposals on the whole-life costs and compared to the original scheme
options.
NOTE
During detailed design alternative materials or elements or details can be identified as desirable to
benefit the construction cost or programme or to improve the durability or level of service offered by the
asset. Where these alternatives are expected to increase the whole-life cost of the asset by more than
10% they can be considered to be significant.

2. Evaluation procedure
2.21
The results of the analysis for the proposed changes shall be reported to the Overseeing Organisation
with a recommendation for implementation or otherwise.
2.22
Where changes occur during construction these shall be incorporated into the life-cycle management
plan and stored in a format, agreed with the Overseeing Organisation, with the 'as-built' information for
the asset in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's data and record requirements.
NOTE
At the construction stage it can not be desirable to reconsider scheme options due to changes that are
necessary due to site circumstances.
2.22.1
However the potential impact on whole-life costs should be a criterion for deciding which changes are
to be implemented.
NOTE
Changes to design, details or materials required to overcome difficulties encountered on site can have
a significant impact on the whole life cost of the asset.

Traffic delay costs
3.1
An assessment of traffic delay costs shall be undertaken throughout the assessment period for the
asset for the following:
1) the initial construction or maintenance activities;
2) the subsequent inspection, maintenance, and renewal activities.
NOTE
The traffic management required for the initial construction or maintenance activity can probably be well
defined. However for subsequent activities the traffic management requirements and their duration
could be less clear. Due to this lack of precision a sophisticated traffic delay analysis is not warranted
in most cases.
3.2
The assessment of traffic delay costs shall be undertaken using a methodology that includes each of
the following:
1) characteristics of the roads affected;
2) predicted traffic flows;
3) characteristics of the lane closures;
4) potential diversion routes.
3.2.1
The carriageways that are to be affected by the activities should be identified from the location and
extent of the activity to be undertaken.
3.2.2
The AADT traffic flows for the length of route that can be affected by the activities should be determined
from available sources.
NOTE 1
Available primary sources of AADT flows include Traffic counts [Ref 2.I]; Webtris
webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/ [Ref 4.I]; and
https://opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/northern-ireland-traffic-count-data www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/
[Ref 1.I].
NOTE 2
The cost of user delays can be established from the online data provided in WebTAG Unit A3 [Ref 3.I]
Department for Transport (UK).
3.2.3
The impact of the scheme option activities on the affected carriageways should be assessed to
determine:
1) the number of lanes available at pinch points which have the greatest potential to cause delay to
traffic;
2) the length over which the restrictions apply;
3) any temporary speed limits;
4) length of diversion routes and probable speed of travel (if diversions applicable).
NOTE
An example of an acceptable approach to calculating traffic delay costs is given in Appendix A. Where
activities on a structure form part of a larger project for which a detailed analysis is required then the
more detailed analysis can be used to determine the traffic delay costs.

A1
Traffic delay cost
In the absence of a more refined method the following has been devised as a quick, though unrefined,
method of calculating traffic delay costs due to restrictions imposed on the network. As the calculation
can largely be applied to situations where the extent, duration and timing of lane closures may be
estimated values, this is reflected in broad banding of timings of the restrictions. This may only be used
for the purpose of calculating user delay costs associated with works included within the scope of this
document for inclusion within a life-cycle costing analysis.
Equation A.1 Total Vehicle Delay (TVD)
TV D = (DTc + CRDc) −(DTn + CRDn)
60
× EV × EF
where:
TVD
is total vehicle delay in vehicle hours
DTc
is the expected drive time in lane closure conditions over the length of the restriction (min)
DTn
is the expected drive time in normal conditions over the length of the restriction (min)
CRDn
is the Capacity Related Delay time in normal conditions (min)
CRDc
is the Capacity Related Delay time in lane closure conditions (min)
EV
is the expected equivalent hourly volume of traffic for each period
EF
is an economic factor to be applied to the cost to take account of the extent of planning
and forewarning that has been provided prior to imposition of the lane closure(s).

Tabulated values
Tabulated values are given on the following pages for each of the above variables to allow a quick
assessment of cost. Different values apply if the lane closures are to be imposed on a weekday,
weekday night, weekend day or weekend night. The approximate length of the restriction needs to be
estimated and the AADT for the carriageway where the works are to be be located is needed. (At time
of writing traffic flow data is available at http:// webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/ [Ref 4.I],
www.opendatani.gov.uk/dataset/ [Ref 1.I], Traffic counts [Ref 2.I]. The speed limits that will be
applicable in normal and lane closure conditions are also needed. For full carriageway closures the
tabulated values do not apply and the delays due to use of diversion route(s) have to be evaluated by
assessment of the length of the diversion(s), the volume of traffic and the likely speed of travel.
A3
Monetary cost
To give a monetary cost to the delay, the data from WebTAG Unit A3 [Ref 3.I] (or equivalent at time of
calculation) for the average vehicle cost per hour for cars:goods vehicle ratio of 85:15 can be used. For
2018 values of £13.55 for a car and £17.81 (average goods vehicles) for a goods vehicle gives £14.20
used in the example.
A4
Example
Network length with 60,000 AADT on 3-lane carriageway with speed limit of 113 km/h.
Restricted to 2 lanes for 6 hrs during a weekday daytime with speed limit of 80 km/h.
Length of restriction of 1.0 km (incl tapers)
From Tables : DTn= 0.53; CRDn=0.0587; DTc= 0.75; CRDc=1.2293
EV = 60,000(AADT) x 0.062 (for weekday daytime) = 3720

Example of output of an appraisal
In the output illustrated please note the following :
1) Due to space limitations a 20-year extract of an evaluation is shown to illustrate the principles only; a
60-year period is normally required.
2) Relatively small value activities, such as annual routine maintenance, have been 'rolled up' and
included in PI (Principal Inspection) costs.
3) Years where there are zero costs have not been shown.
4) Discount factors are based on a discount rate of 3.5% for years 1-30 and 3.0% thereafter. Rates
applicable at the time of the appraisal should be used.
5) Costs in the table are in 000's.
6) 'Link' should provide a reference or link to where build ups of the values entered in the table can be
found.
7) The costs used are for illustration only and do not reflect actual estimates as these depend on bridge
type, span, obstacles crossed etc.
