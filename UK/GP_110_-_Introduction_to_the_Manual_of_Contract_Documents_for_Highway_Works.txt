Introduction
Introduction
Background
The Manual of Contract Documents for Highway Works, published by National Highways is a suite of
documents that form part of the Works Information ( NEC 3 [Ref 2.N]) or Works Scope ( NEC 4 [Ref
3.N]) .
Previously the Manual of Contract Documents for Highway Works (MCHW) was made up of seven
volumes:
1)
Volume 0 Introduction to the MCHW and model contracts;
2)
Volume 1 Specification for Highway Works (SHW);
3)
Volume 2 Notes for guidance on the Specification for Highway Works;
4)
Volume 3 Highway construction details;
5)
Volume 4 Bills of Quantities for Highway Works;
6)
Volume 5 Contracts Documents for Specialist Activities;
7)
Volume 6 Departmental Standards and Advice Notes on Contract Documentation and Site
Supervision.
These were reviewed and amended as follows:
1)
Volume 0 - withdrawn, with some content being transferred to GP 110 and GC 100 documents;
the rest withdrawn without replacement as either obsolete or no longer required;
2)
Volume 1 & Volume 2 have been reviewed and the content has been transferred to the Design
Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) where the requirements are the responsibility of the
designer or subsumed into the new suite of MCHW documents within the disciplines;
3)
Volume 3 - where deemed still necessary following their review, the drawings have been moved
to either the SHW or to the DMRB covering that subject or to the Operational Technology
Standards Library (OTSL) for traffic technology items;
4)
Volume 4 - updated method of measurement / bill of quantity documents to complement the new
MCHW suite;
5)
Volume 5 - specification requirements and notes for guidance have been moved to the
replacement for Volumes 1 & 2 and method of measurement and bill of quantities moved to the
Volume 4 replacement where required;
6)
Volume 6 - all documents are now either withdrawn as obsolete or the content has been moved to
the DMRB.
Notes for guidance for the specifier
In the new MCHW, there are no Notes for Guidance or contract specific appendices. The
contract-specific appendices are now Works Specific Requirements (WSR), with Specifier instructions
(SI) to inform the specifier what is required.
Throughout the Notes for Guidance the term "compiler" was used to refer to the individual or
organisation responsible for the preparation of contract-specific information and requirements. The role
is now called the "Specifier".
MCHW Structure - the new format
MCHW is made up of a number of documents which collectively make up the Specification for Highway
Works (SHW) and the Instructions for Specifiers (IfS).
The documents that make up the MCHW are listed in GC 000 [Ref 11.N] and GP 000 [Ref 6.N]
The SHW provides constructor requirements for the implementation of highway works and is to be used
as the base specification in highway contracts.

GP 110 Version 1.0.0
Introduction
The IfS is a set of instructions to the Specifier; that is, the party compiling the contract specification, on
the inclusion of contract specific requirements.
The IfS documents also replicate the SHW requirements within their texts to aid the compilation of the
contract-specific requirements.
The contract-specific requirements are to be presented using Works Specific Requirements (WSR).
The WSR are referenced in the SHW documents.
Templates for the WSR are provided with the IfS documents and are to be used for the compilation of
the contract specification.
National versions
There are four versions of each MCHW document, one each for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland
and Wales.
The contents of the documents that differ between National versions are presented using Nationally
Determined Sections (NDS) and Nationally Determined Requirements (NDR). These are identified in
the documents by the prefixes E, NI, S and W to the requirement numbers.
Downloadable documents
The authoring software for the specification generates a number of output files, these are specific to the
role and needs of the user:
1)
Specification for Highway Works (SHW) - contains only the SHW requirements;
a)
core document - containing UK-wide requirements and all national variations;
b)
national variation - contains UK-wide requirements and the national variations for a specific
region;
2)
Instructions to Specifiers (IfS) - contains both core SHW requirements and the instructions to
specifiers (SI and WSR);
a)
core document - containing UK-wide requirements and instructions, and all national
variations;
b)
national variation - contains UK-wide requirements and instructions, and the national
variations for a specific region;
3)
WSR Templates - these are spreadsheet files derived from the WSR clauses and presented in an
editable form that can be more easily populated.
General requirements for the Specification for Highway Works and other preliminary items
General requirements for the following are stated in SHW document GC 101 [Ref 5.N]and the
accompanying WSR. They give overarching and default requirements. These requirements are
applicable to all contracts using MCHW and are cross referenced in the other SHW documents:
1)
communications;
2)
documentation, including records;
3)
quality management, including quality management schemes;
4)
competence;
5)
overarching product requirements;
6)
verification;
7)
Contractor design, including technical approval and temporary works.
Other preliminaries items are covered in the following documents which include aspects that are
applicable to all MCHW contracts:
1)
GC 102 [Ref 10.N]Site and work constraints;

Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 7.N] apply to this document.
While this document is primarily aimed at the person /organisation assuming the specifier role for the
MCHW, it is also relevant to anyone assuming a design role.
It is assumed that the design outputs for a project provide all the necessary information for the
construction of the works using the MCHW.
It is assumed that the design outputs used for the specification and the works are established using the
Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB).
MCHW modifications
MCHW is to be used as it stands wherever possible. Where modifications are necessary these will be
departures from standard and need to be dealt with in accordance with the Overseeing Organisation's
procedures.
Modifications to MCHW are to be incorporated into contracts using the WSR.
Basis of the specification
The SHW states the requirements for the provision of products that are to be included in the works and
installation requirements to instruct on the inclusion of the products into the works.
It also includes requirements for undertaking verification activities and the submission of documentation
aimed at providing evidence and assurance that the works are being, and have been, provided in
accordance with the specification.
Verification activities include testing, checking, inspection, examination, measuring, monitoring, trials
and demonstrations for the works.
Documentation submissions include for all works information, notifications, product information and
certification, quality documentation and works records required by the Overseeing Organisation.

WSR templates use the term 'element'. A WSR can be compiled for particular elements of the works
and thus provide requirements for individual parts of the works.
NOTE 2
A WSR would need to be compiled for each work element, thus multiple WSR templates would be
required where requirements are to be input for multiple elements of the works, except where
schedules provide for multiple elements.
3.12.2
Schedules should use unique references for items of work that coordinate between different schedules
and with drawings or models.
3.12.3
WSR entries should be used to link specification requirements to the associated contract drawings
and/or digital drawings and/or digital models.
