Introduction
Introduction
Background
Through our customer service strategy we aim to deliver better relationships with our customers. We
need customers to trust us and know that we care. Listening to our customers' views and responding to
their contact is integral to achieving these aims.
Good quality and timely responses to customer contact is fundamental, with the Institute of Customer
Service's satisfaction index highlighting quality and speed of response as significant factors in
determining customer experience. See ICSSI [Ref 2.I].
This customer service standard for the quality and timeliness of responses to customer contact will
enable our employees to consistently deliver the basics. This enables improvement to the customer
experience, delivering more customer focused and timely responses to customer contact.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 4.N] apply to this document.
