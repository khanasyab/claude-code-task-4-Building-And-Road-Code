Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document sets out the requirements and advice for dealing with surface water runoff from natural
catchments draining towards motorways and all-purpose trunk roads, in order to limit the frequency and
severity of flooding incidents caused by runoff from beyond the highway boundary. By enhancing flood
risk management design requirements, the impact of extreme storm events, such as those experienced
during autumn 2000, will be minimised. In August 2020 runoff from a natural catchment contributed to a
fatal rail accident.
Surface water runoff to road drainage systems is conventionally assumed to derive from the road
cross-section. This includes the road surface, verges and adjacent cuttings or embankments (known
as interior catchment). Additional surface flow may also be produced by runoff draining to the road from
land outside the highway boundary known as exterior catchment.
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.
Exterior catchments can be rural, urban or a combination of both. This document deals solely with rural
(natural) catchments since exterior urban catchments have their own specific drainage systems.

1. Scope
1.
Scope
Aspects covered
1.1
The requirements, advice and methodologies contained within this document shall apply to new road
projects as well as to drainage improvement schemes on existing roads.
1.2
To ensure resilience of the road network during extreme weather conditions, all runoff from natural
catchments draining to the road shall be intercepted and prevented from entering the road drainage
network.
NOTE 1
Natural catchments adjacent to roads vary significantly in size, shape, type of soil and vegetation cover,
and the amount of runoff contributing to existing road drainage systems can range from negligible to
significant.
NOTE 2
Natural catchment drainage systems are separated from the road drainage systems with both systems
retained in the ownership of the Overseeing Organisation.
1.3
Roads with a history of flooding from smaller catchments (less than 0.01 km2, or 1ha) shall be
remediated.
1.4
Sites with a history of frequent flooding shall be remediated on a site-specific basis.
1.5
Where flooding and inundation of the road drainage network is the consequence of changes in
groundwater levels, an assessment of the causes shall be undertaken before implementing a design
solution.
1.6
In undertaking an assessment of the source of road flooding from changes in groundwater levels, the
relevant environment protection agency (EPA) or the British Geological Society shall be consulted.
NOTE
In certain areas of the UK and in periods of high groundwater levels, springs can appear at the surface
in catchments adjacent to roads. These springs can generate significant flows and potentially cause or
increase the risk of road flooding.
Implementation
1.7
This document shall be implemented forthwith on all schemes involving the drainage of runoff from
natural catchments on the Overseeing Organisations' motorway and all-purpose trunk roads according
to the implementation requirements of GG 101 [Ref 5.N].
Use of GG 101
1.8
The requirements contained in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] shall be followed in respect of activities covered by
this document.
Health and safety
1.9
Safety risk mitigation measures shall follow the ERIC hierarchy - eliminate, reduce, isolate and control
for each identified safety risk.

Methodology
2.1
When determining the procedure for dealing with runoff from natural catchments, the stages identified
in Figure 2.1N1 shall be followed.
NOTE 1
The most important stages for dealing with runoff from natural catchments are:
1)
identification of flood prone areas and characterisation of natural catchment;
2)
estimation of runoff; and
3)
hydraulic design of ditches, pipes or culverts and/or upgrade of existing road drainage system.

3. Natural catchment identification
3.
Natural catchment identification
3.1
The size, shape and location of natural catchments draining towards motorways and all-purpose trunk
roads shall be determined.
NOTE
The runoff rate from natural catchments is likely to vary from negligible amounts from catchments of
small dimensions to large flow rates which can adversely impact upon the safe operation of the road
(e.g. overburdening of the road drainage system, soil erosion, slope stability).
3.2
Flows from natural catchments shall either discharge into ditches or pipes, or pass through culverts or
bridges under the road.
NOTE 1
Natural catchments are likely to vary considerably along the road alignment.
NOTE 2
There are two types of natural catchment that can be encountered alongside roads, valley catchments
or strip catchments (see Figure 3.2N2).
Figure 3.2N2 Valley and strip catchments
3.3
Data from a topographical survey or LiDAR shall be obtained to determine the type, width and length of
the natural catchment.
3.4
Where a catchment exceeds 10 km width, the methods described in the Flood Estimation Handbook
FEH [Ref 3.N] shall be used.
NOTE
In flat areas, the definition of the natural catchment boundary is not always obvious.
3.4.1
When defining the extent of natural catchments adjacent to roads, Ordnance Survey maps at 1:25,000
scale should be consulted.
3.4.2
Site inspections may provide useful information on relevant local features that impact on flow paths,
such as intersecting ditches, mounds and embankments.
NOTE
Due to the linear nature of roads, the discharge points for the natural catchment flows is in most cases
the same as those used for the discharge of road runoff.

3. Natural catchment identification
3.4.3
The criteria to be met in terms of pollution loads is potentially less stringent for runoff from natural
catchments and therefore more points of discharge may be determined to be suitable.
NOTE
Areas where the amount of silt in the runoff is expected to be very high can still be associated with a
significant pollution risk.
3.5
All natural catchments with a width greater than 50 m shall be investigated.
3.6
Natural catchments that are less than 50 m in width shall be investigated where there is a history of
frequent local flooding.
3.7
Areas susceptible to flood risk shall be identified for design intervention.
NOTE 1
Areas susceptible to flood risk on new schemes include (but not are limited to):
1)
low points/areas (sag);
2)
inner areas of bends in road alignment where accumulation of flow can occur due to adjacent
catchment;
3)
connection with other roadways (e.g. slip roads) that can act as a drainage pathway;
4)
large fields adjacent to the road (see Figure 3.7N3, Examples A.1, B.1 and C.1);
5)
slopes intercepted by the road (see Figure 3.7N3, Examples A.2 and A.3);
6)
areas of well-defined stream catchment (even if stream is ephemeral) producing concentrated
flows; and/or
7)
presence of natural springs.
NOTE 2
Areas susceptible to flood risk on existing schemes include (but not are limited to):
1)
those with poor condition of existing cut-off ditches, land drainage and culverts (i.e. overgrown
vegetation in ditches, blockages in culverts and ditches, collapsed drains); and
2)
those where the outfall does not allow free discharge.
NOTE 3
Examples of natural catchments that can produce volumes of runoff which can impact upon safe
operation are given in Figure 3.7N3. They refer to two situations, roads in cutting and in shallow
embankments.

4.
Collection of runoff
4.1
Where natural catchments containing a well-defined watercourse are intercepted by roads, a culvert or
bridge shall be provided to ensure that the runoff is conveyed away from the road construction.
NOTE
The design of culverts is covered in CD 529 [Ref 2.N].
4.2
Where natural catchments without a well-defined watercourse path are intercepted by roads, ditches or
pipes shall be used to convey and discharge the runoff.
NOTE 1
Natural catchments without a well-defined watercourse path can produce significant amounts of runoff.
NOTE 2
For the design of ditches see CD 532 [Ref 7.N].
NOTE 3
For the design of piped drainage see CG 501 [Ref 1.N].
4.3
The runoff from the natural catchment shall discharge freely into the drainage system.

5. Estimation of runoff
5.
Estimation of runoff
5.1
Flow rates from natural catchments shall be determined for a 1 in 100 year storm with the relevant
allowance for climate change.
NOTE 1
For climate change allowances see LA 113 [Ref 6.N].
NOTE 2
Road drainage systems are designed to intercept and remove rainfall from short duration, high intensity
events with return periods of 1 year for no surcharge of piped systems or road-edge channels or 5
years for no flooding of the carriageway.
NOTE 3
Runoff from natural catchments can have tortuous flow paths. Flood flows from natural catchments can
take several hours to reach the point of discharge. The duration of a flood event from a natural
catchment can therefore lead to longer periods of traffic disruption when compared with flood events
occurring on the carriageway, where the time of concentration of the system is only a few minutes.
NOTE 4
For advice on assessing and recording the risks associated with exceedance flows see CG 501 [Ref
1.N].
5.2
The estimation of runoff from natural catchments shall be undertaken using one of the runoff
methodologies referenced below:
1)
Institute of Hydrology Report 124 IH 124 [Ref 4.N];
2)
Flood Estimation Handbook FEH [Ref 3.N].
5.3
IH 124 [Ref 4.N] shall only be used to estimate flood flows on catchments with surface areas less than
25 ha.
NOTE 1
IH 124 [Ref 4.N] is a runoff methodology that allows estimation of runoff from natural catchments
without the need for hydraulic modelling.
NOTE 2
The design flows estimated with the runoff methodologies are surface runoff flows that take into
account saturation of the soil.
