Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document covers the calculation of design traffic (i.e. commercial vehicle pavement loading over
the design period) for new trunk roads, including motorway schemes and for the maintenance of
existing trunk roads, including motorways.
In the UK, pavement designs for particular materials are intrinsically related to the road pavement
structural wear resulting from traffic (i.e. fatigue cracking within the bound pavement layers and/or
excessive subgrade deformation). Pavement designs for flexible and rigid pavements are presented in
CD 226 [Ref 2.N].
Road pavement structural wear in the UK is calculated using wear factors based on axle loads. Wear
factors have been calculated for commercial vehicle axle loads from measurements made using
weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors installed on the road network. The background to the method is given
in TRL Report ( TRL PPR 66 [Ref 2.I])
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 5.N] apply to this document.

Design traffic
The commercial vehicle loading over the design period of a
pavement. It is expressed as the number of equivalent 80kN
standard axles.
Existing road schemes
Existing road maintenance schemes, including full reconstruction,
partial reconstruction, overlay, plane off and inlay, surface
treatment, or narrow widening, where there is greater certainty
about traffic flows, based on the existing road traffic counts.
Full reconstruction
Maintenance treatment that involves replacement of all the bound
layers and extends into the foundation.
Narrow widening
Area of pavement widening 1.2 m or less.
New carriageway
A new road or carriageway (as opposed to an existing lane or one
or more new lanes abutting an existing pavement).
New road schemes
New design schemes, including new carriageway, on-line
widening or upgrading of an existing pavement, where there is
greater uncertainty about traffic flows.
On-line widening
Where additional carriageway is constructed abutting the existing
carriageway.
Overlay
Maintenance treatment that involves adding a new base course
and/or binder course and/or surface course to an existing road
surface.
Partial reconstruction
Maintenance treatment that involves replacement of all the bound
layers.
Plane off and inlay
Maintenance treatment that involves replacement of some of the
bound layers.
Re-alignment
Where there is a change in the arrangement of one or more lanes.
Standard axle
An axle exerting or applying a force of 80kN.
Strengthening treatment
A deeper treatment that strengthens the pavement as defined in
CD 227 [Ref 3.N].
Surface treatment
Maintenance treatment that involves the application of a material
to or mechanical reworking of an existing road surface to improve
characteristics such as skid resistance, macrotexture, noise and
service life.
Upgrading of an existing
pavement
Upgrading of an existing pavement includes conversion of a hard
shoulder to a running lane and incorporation of an existing
pavement into new construction.
Wear factor
The structural wear factor associated with each passing vehicle
increases with increasing axle load. Although alternative methods
are available, structural wear for pavement design in the UK is
taken as being proportional to the 4th power of the axle load.

2. Calculation of design traffic for traffic ass...
NOTE
There can be greater certainty about future traffic flows, based on the existing road traffic counts, for
example, when the new road scheme does not notably add capacity and/or improve efficiency of the
traffic flow that might otherwise attract an uncertain (higher) future traffic flow.
Existing road schemes
2.10
Where there are existing AADF data for the scheme, they shall be used to determine the commercial
vehicle flow.
2.11
Existing data sources shall include:
1)
Traffic Count Database [Ref 6.N], to obtain yearly estimated, manual count or automatic counter
AADF data via the interactive map. This AADF data for the site number(s) applicable to the
scheme can be downloaded by direction of travel as a .csv file to extract the cv count data by
class or category; and,
2)
National Highways Traffic Information System ( WebTRIS [Ref 4.N]) . Click on the count site icon,
to obtain yearly count AADF data via the interactive map. This AADF data for the site ID(s)
applicable to the scheme can be downloaded by direction of travel as a .csv file to extract the total
AADF and percentage of cv (shown as '%>6.6 m') to provide a count for all commercial vehicles.
2.12
Where there are no existing AADF data, a classified traffic count shall be carried out and converted to
AADF using the principles given in the COBA Manual ( COBA [Ref 7.N]).
NOTE
A classified traffic count can be carried out by a trained enumerator, to count traffic by commercial
vehicle class over a 12 hour period (7am to 7pm) on a neutral weekday. A neutral weekday is taken to
be between March and October, excluding public holidays, school holidays and any other days where
the traffic flow is not expected to be typical e.g. due to local traffic management.
2.13
For existing road schemes, where there is greater uncertainty about future traffic flows, based on the
existing road traffic counts, the calculation of future traffic shall proceed as for new road schemes.
NOTE
There can be greater uncertainty about future traffic flows, based on the existing road traffic counts, for
example, when the existing road scheme notably improves the efficiency of the traffic flow such that it
could attract an uncertain (higher) future traffic flow.
Design period
2.14
For new road schemes, the design period (Y) is the number of years over which traffic is to be
assessed (future traffic), and shall be defined according to the design life given in CD 226 [Ref 2.N].
2.15
For existing road schemes, the design period (Y) shall be the number of years since opening or the last
strengthening treatment of the carriageway up to the current year (past traffic), plus the minimum
structural life required after treatment given in CD 227 [Ref 3.N] (future traffic).
Growth factor
Future traffic

2. Calculation of design traffic for traffic ass...
NOTE 2
The growth factors (G) are based on the 'high growth GDP' scenario 5 of the road traffic forecasts 2015
( RTF 2015 [Ref 3.I]). The equivalent annual growth rates (R) are 1.07% for OGV1 + PSV, 2.10% for
OGV2 and 1.54% for all commercial vehicles.
NOTE 3
Compared with RTF 2015, the growth factors based on 'high growth GDP' scenario 2 of the road traffic
forecasts 2018 ( RTF 2018 [Ref 4.I]) indicate a reduced future traffic volume, that partly recovers based
on the 'high economy' [high growth GDP] scenario of the road traffic forecasts 2022 ( RTF 2022 [Ref
1.I]). With continued economic uncertainty in the wake of Brexit, and continued uncertainty regarding
the coronavirus effects on future work travel behaviours, the RTF 2015 growth factors are retained.
2.17
Where no information on commercial vehicle classes and categories is available, a 40 year design
period (Y) and a growth factor (G) of 1.45 shall be used.
2.18
Where there is a requirement to calculate the traffic flow after i years (for example, to calculate the
current year flow for an existing road scheme from the most recent historical classified traffic count
data, or when calculating the polished stone value and aggregate abrasion value at the end of the
anticipated life of the surface course), the annual growth rate (R) shall be used as in Equation 2.18.
Equation 2.18 Traffic flow
Fi = F ×
(
(1 + R)i)
where:
F
is commercial vehicle flow (AADF)
Fi
is traffic flow after i years
R
is the Annual growth rate
NOTE 1
For example, for an existing road, where the most recent historical classified traffic count data provides
AADF that is 2 years old, then the current year 'all commercial vehicles' flow (AADF), for R = 1.54%,
becomes (1.0154)2 = 1.03 times higher.
NOTE 2
For example, after 10 years the OGV2 flow (R = 2.10%) becomes 1.02110 = 1.23 times the current year
flow (F). This is larger than the equivalent growth factor (G) for a 10 year design period (shown as 1.10
in Table 2.16) as it is the flow in year 10 rather than the average across the 10 years.
Past traffic
2.19
Where historical classified traffic counts are available, carried out and converted to AADF using the
principles given in the COBA Manual ( COBA [Ref 7.N]), they shall be used to calculate the traffic flow
that has been carried by that existing road scheme for that year.
NOTE 1
A historical classified traffic count can include that carried out by a trained enumerator for a previous
maintenance design or re-alignment.
NOTE 2
A historical classified traffic count can include Traffic Count Database [Ref 6.N]data based on a manual
count or an automatic counter.
NOTE 3
Where historical classified traffic counts are not available for a particular year, Traffic Count Database
[Ref 6.N]data based on an estimated count, or National Highways Traffic Information System (
WebTRIS [Ref 4.N]) data, can be used.
2.20
For those years where data is not available, the AADF shall be the same as that for the next, later, year
where data is available.
Current year flow
2.21
For an existing road scheme, the current year flow (AADF) shall be determined from the most recent
historical classified traffic count data.

For example, for a scheme comprising on-line narrow widening, with subsequent re-alignment of an
existing lane, then WM can be applied where there remains certainty of the future traffic flow based on
the past traffic.
Percentage of commercial vehicles in the heaviest loaded lane
2.26
For carriageways with 2 or more lanes in one direction, the proportion of vehicles in the most heavily
loaded lane (P) shall be calculated using Table 2.26.

Where required for maintenance purposes, the traffic in the other lanes shall be based on the
assumptions in Table 2.27.
Table 2.27 Assumed distribution of commercial vehicles in other lanes
2-lanes
All traffic not in the heaviest loaded lane is in the other lane.
3-lanes
All commercial vehicle traffic is in lanes 1 and 2 - traffic not in the heaviest
loaded lane is in the other lane.
4 or more lanes
Classified traffic count data are needed to confirm the distribution of traffic
across each lane. No commercial vehicle traffic is in the right hand lane.
Design traffic
2.28
The future cumulative design traffic, in terms of million standard axles (msa), for each commercial
vehicle class or category c shall be calculated according to Equations 2.28a and 2.28b.
Equation 2.28a Weighted annual traffic
Tc = 365 × F × G × W × 10−6msa
Equation 2.28b Design traffic (T) in the heaviest loaded lane
T =
∑
Tc × Y × P
where:
Tc
is the weighted annual traffic for commercial vehicle class or category c
F
is the commercial vehicle flow (AADF)
G
= Growth factor
W
= Wear factor (WM for maintenance or WN for new design)
Y
= Design period (years)
P
= Percentage of commercial vehicles in the heaviest loaded lane
T
= Design traffic
2.29
Detailed design traffic calculations shall be recorded as required by Section 7 of CD 226 [Ref 2.N].
2.29.1
Design traffic calculations may be made using the proforma given in Appendix A.

Example traffic calculations for existing road schemes
B2.1
Past traffic for an existing road scheme
An example 15 year past traffic calculation for an existing road scheme is given in Table B.2.
For this example, historical classified traffic count DfT data (by cv class) Traffic Count Database [Ref
6.N] is available for the year 2021 only, and WebTRIS data (by all commercial vehicles) WebTRIS [Ref
4.N] is available for the years 2013, 2018, 2021 and 2022 only. The last major structural maintenance
of this example carriageway was 2010; and the current year is 2024.
Calculation Steps:
1)
Populate Table B.2 with AADF for each year that data is available; and calculate life (msa) = F x
WM x P x 365 x 10-6.
2)
Project the most recent data (by cv Class) to give the AADT for the current year.
3)
For those years where there is no AADF data, use the same life (msa) as that for the next year
where data is available.
4)
Sum the msa calculated for each year, to determine the Past Traffic.

Introduction
Introduction
Background
This document covers the calculation of design traffic (i.e. commercial vehicle pavement loading over
the design period) for new trunk roads, including motorway schemes and for the maintenance of
existing trunk roads, including motorways.
In the UK, pavement designs for particular materials are intrinsically related to the road pavement
structural wear resulting from traffic (i.e. fatigue cracking within the bound pavement layers and/or
excessive subgrade deformation). Pavement designs for flexible and rigid pavements are presented in
CD 226 [Ref 1.N].
Road pavement structural wear in the UK is calculated using wear factors based on axle loads. Wear
factors have been calculated for commercial vehicle axle loads from measurements made using
weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors installed on the road network. The background to the method is given
in TRL Report ( TRL PPR 66 [Ref 1.I])
Assumptions made in the preparation of this document
The assumptions made in GG 101 [Ref 2.N] apply to this document.
