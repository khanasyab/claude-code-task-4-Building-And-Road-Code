An example of a poor choice is hydrophobic impregnation on top of a sacrificial anti-graffiti coating.
2.2
Where hydrophobic impregnation is proposed for structures subject to the following situations an
environmental impact assessment shall be carried out in accordance with LA 113 [Ref 6.N]:
1)
structures located within water bodies;
2)
structures located near water bodies; and
3)
where the hydrophobic impregnation products could find their way into the water environment.
2.2.1

2. Application of hydrophobic impregnation
NOTE
The constraints to the application of hydrophobic impregnation can include:
1)
encapsulating the structure receiving hydrophobic impregnation;
2)
masking of elements or components of the structure that could be adversely affected by the
hydrophobic impregnation such as bearings, painted steel surfaces, bituminous materials, joint
sealants;
3)
covering carriageway surfacing to prevent contamination;
4)
protection measures to prevent contamination of the local or sensitive environments;
5)
any restrictions necessary at the location e.g. access, time intervals, noise, surface preparation;
6)
duration of closures for the application of hydrophobic impregnation affecting the travelling public;
or
7)
site-specific control measures for a non-continuous hydrophobic impregnation application
operation to prevent areas where the hydrophobic impregnation application is omitted due to a
break in operations.
2.8.2
Site specific control measures for a non-continuous hydrophobic impregnation application operation
may include:
1)
the use of removable temporary markers or markings showing the extent of hydrophobic
impregnation application from the previous working shift;
2)
use of fugitive dyes in the hydrophobic impregnation product that turn colourless following the
application of the hydrophobic impregnation product to show the extent of application from the
previous working shift; or
3)
providing a minimum overlap length onto the previous working shift's application of the
hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE 1
There is a risk that non-continuous application of hydrophobic impregnation materials on the face of a
concrete structure element can result in gaps in coverage of hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE 2
Situations that can prevent the application of hydrophobic impregnation being completed in a
continuous operation to the face of a concrete structural element include:
1)
extents of traffic management facilitating safe access to the works does not extend to the entire
face of the concrete structural element;
2)
access arrangements, such as specialist underbridge units, do not extend to the entire face of the
concrete structural element; or
3)
working time constraints, such as the duration of traffic management, which limit the extent of
hydrophobic impregnation application to the structural element face within the working shift.
2.9
The design outputs shall clearly state any constraints and site specific control measures for the
application of hydrophobic impregnation systems on concrete highway structures.
2.10
Hydrophobic impregnation products shall be clear and colourless following application to the concrete
substrate.
NOTE
Hydrophobic impregnation products that are not clear and colourless can obscure defects and hinder
inspections.
Suitability of concrete structures or structural elements for hydrophobic
impregnation
2.11
The suitability and extent of hydrophobic impregnation application on new concrete structures or
refurbishment of existing concrete structures to protect against diffusion of chloride ions shall be agreed
with the Overseeing Organisation during development of scheme options.
NOTE
Where application of hydrophobic impregnation is agreed, the early application of hydrophobic
impregnation can limit contamination of the structure from chloride ions.

CD 373 Version 0.1.0
2. Application of hydrophobic impregnation
2.11.1
Hydrophobic impregnation should be applied to concrete highway structures at risk of reinforcement
corrosion due to diffusion of chloride ions, such as those subject to the following chloride exposure
conditions:
1)
where one surface is immersed in water containing chlorides and another is exposed to air in
accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I]; or
2)
exposure class XS3 in accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I]
NOTE 1
Further information is provided in BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I] on the situation for reinforced concrete where one
surface is immersed in water containing chlorides and another is exposed to air such as ballast walls as
a more severe exposure condition than a structure completely immersed in water containing chlorides
from sources other than seawater.
NOTE 2
Diffusion of chloride ions is not expected where the concrete capillary absorption to water is
< 0.01
kg
m2·h0.5 in accordance with BS EN 1504-2 [Ref 2.I].
NOTE 3
Reinforced concrete elements at risk of reinforcement corrosion due to diffusion of chloride ions can
include the following:
1)
piers, columns, crossheads and abutments within 10 metres of the edge of the carriageway
subjected to deicing salt spray;
2)
piers, columns, crossheads and abutments with a deck joint above, but without a functioning
positive drainage system;
3)
the tops of piers, columns, crossheads and abutments with a deck joint above, but without a
functioning positive drainage system, where accessible;
4)
bearing shelves, screen walls, shear walls, ballast walls, deck diaphragms and deck ends with a
deck joint above, where accessible;
5)
concrete parapets, parapet plinths (all inclinations), parapet stringcourses and concrete deck top
surfaces not protected with deck waterproofing;
6)
parts of deck soffits directly over and within 8 metres vertically above the carriageway or 10
metres horizontally of the edge of the carriageway; and
7)
walls within 10 metres of the edge of carriageway.
2.12
Hydrophobic impregnation shall not be used as a permanent solution to rectify deficient concrete cover
to reinforcement unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE
Hydrophobic impregnation can be fully effective for more than 15 years and retain some protective
effect up to 20 years after application.
2.13
Hydrophobic impregnation shall not be applied to existing concrete structures where chloride levels
within the concrete substrate exceed the threshold for initiation of corrosion of reinforcement in
accordance with CS 462 [Ref 5.N].
Application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation on existing concrete
structures
2.14
The application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation on existing concrete highway structures to
protect against diffusion of chloride ions shall be agreed with the Overseeing Organisation during
development of scheme options.
2.14.1
Hydrophobic impregnation may be applied or reapplied to existing structures in the following situations:
1)
after expiry of the system's expected life in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendations;
2)
where the existing structure is exposed to diffusion of chloride ions but there is low risk of active
ongoing corrosion in accordance with CS 462 [Ref 5.N]; or
3)
concrete substrate has been subjected to physical abrasion and degradation beyond the depth of
penetration of the hydrophobic impregnation system.

2. Application of hydrophobic impregnation
NOTE
Hydrophobic impregnation can only be relied on to be effective for 15 years if the material is applied
correctly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2.15
Where the application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation on the refurbishment of existing
concrete structures has been agreed in principle by the Overseeing Organisation, the condition of the
existing concrete substrate shall be confirmed by:
1)
examining the most recent Principal or General Inspection reports; or
2)
undertaking a Special Inspection in accordance with CS 450 [Ref 3.N].
2.16
Where defects are present on the existing concrete substrate, repairs shall be designed in accordance
with CS 462 [Ref 5.N]and executed in accordance with CC 484 [Ref 1.N] prior to the application or
reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE
Defects are any flaws in the concrete surface which might impair the application of the product its
coverage of the substrate such as air gaps, cracks, delamination and spalls.
2.17
Prior to designing a scheme for hydrophobic impregnation, the condition of drainage systems, deck
joints and deck waterproofing of existing structures shall be confirmed by:
1)
examining the most recent Principal or General Inspection reports; or
2)
undertaking a Special Inspection in accordance with CS 450 [Ref 3.N].
2.17.1
Where drainage systems, deck joints or deck waterproofing of the structure are found to be defective,
the design drawings should state that drainage systems, deck joints or deck waterproofing require
cleaning, repairing or replacing prior to the application of hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE
Defective drainage systems, deck joints or deck waterproofing can be identified by water leakages or
damp patches on the structure.
2.18
Where there are existing coatings on the concrete substrate that adversely affect performance of the
hydrophobic impregnation, the existing coatings shall be removed prior to the application of the
hydrophobic impregnation.
2.19
The details for the removal of existing coatings prior to the application of hydrophobic impregnation
shall be described within the design drawings.

Materials for hydrophobic impregnation
3.1
Hydrophobic impregnation shall protect the concrete highway structure against diffusion of chloride
ions.
NOTE 1
Hydrophobic impregnation typically consists of a hydrophobising material to the concrete substrate that
penetrates the concrete and reacts with the silicates and moisture present.
NOTE 2
Hydrophobic impregnation products produce a water repellent but vapour permeable layer that
internally lines (or coats) the pores and capillaries and inhibits the ingress of water and chloride ions.
NOTE 3
Hydrophobic impregnation products can be formulated as liquids, gels, or creams to be applied on the
surface of concrete structures.
NOTE 4
Details of performance required for hydrophobic impregnation products that protect a structure from
diffusion of chloride ions can be found in CC 482 [Ref 8.N].

Design outputs for hydrophobic impregnation of concrete highway structures
4.1
The design outputs for hydrophobic impregnation of concrete highway structures shall be in
accordance with Appendix C of CD 350 [Ref 9.N].
NOTE 1
Further details can be found in CD 350 [Ref 9.N]for the background to design outputs for hydrophobic
impregnation of concrete highway structures.
NOTE 2
The extent of application of hydrophobic impregnation proposed for the concrete structure in the design
outputs enables the quantity of hydrophobic impregnation product to be determined.
4.1.1
Trial panels greater than a minimum of 1600 mm length x 1600 mm width may be used where there is
need for greater confidence in the application and performance of the hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE 1
An example of where there is a need for greater confidence in application and performance of the
hydrophobic impregnation system is if a structure is located within a sensitive area.
NOTE 2
Trial panels for hydrophobic impregnation of new concrete structures can be undertaken by treating
new concrete specimens cast with the same concrete mix, surface finish and orientation of the
structural element and/or its part in the permanent works that the trial panel is representing.
NOTE 3
Trial panels for hydrophobic impregnation of existing concrete structures can be undertaken by treating
in-situ areas on the surface of an existing structural concrete element and/or its part that the trial panel
is representing.

E/1. Application of hydrophobic impregnation syste...
E/1.
Application of hydrophobic impregnation systems (CD 373, 2)
General requirements (additional to CD 373)
E/1.1
Unless otherwise agreed with the Overseeing Organisation, hydrophobic impregnation of concrete
highway structures shall only be included in schemes where one or more of the following apply:
1)
access to areas of concrete required for application of hydrophobic impregnation is expected to
be readily available within traffic management measures deployed for other construction work
being undertaken at the same time;
2)
traffic management measures already required for a scheme can be easily extended to
encompass the areas of a concrete structure identified for application of hydrophobic
impregnation, and those measures are expected to be available at the time of treatment;
3)
hydrophobic impregnation is proposed for areas of new structures built off-line, and access to
those areas is not constrained by live traffic at the time of hydrophobic impregnation treatment;
and/or
4)
hydrophobic impregnation treatment can be applied to structural concrete without the need for
traffic management.
NOTE
The application of hydrophobic impregnation as the only permanent works construction activity within a
lane closure or full road closure typically does not provide value for money where the cost of traffic
management is significantly greater than the cost of applying hydrophobic impregnation.
Suitability of concrete structures or structural elements for hydrophobic
impregnation (CD 373, 2.11, 2.11.1 and associated Notes)
E/1.2
CD 373 [Ref 1.N] clauses 2.11, 2.11.1 and associated Notes shall not apply.
E/1.3
Hydrophobic impregnation shall be applied on new reinforced concrete elements at risk of
reinforcement corrosion arising from exposure to chloride ions.
E/1.3.1
The extent of hydrophobic impregnation proposed for new reinforced concrete elements should be
reported to the Overseeing Organisation.
NOTE 1
New reinforced concrete elements at risk of reinforcement corrosion can include parts of:
1)
new reinforced concrete structures;
2)
new modifications to existing reinforced concrete structures; and
3)
newly recast sections and new precast elements of existing reinforced concrete structures.
NOTE 2
Early application of hydrophobic impregnation to the concrete can limit contamination of the structure
from chloride ions.
NOTE 3
Examples of new reinforced concrete elements at risk of reinforcement corrosion include concrete
elements subject to the following chloride exposure conditions:
1)
where one surface is immersed in water containing chlorides and another is exposed to air in
accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I]; or
2)
exposure class XS3 in accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I]; or,
3)
exposure class XD3 in accordance with BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I].
NOTE 4
Further information is provided in BS 8500-1 [Ref 1.I] on the situation for reinforced concrete where one
surface is immersed in water containing chlorides and another is exposed to air such as ballast walls as
a more severe exposure condition than a structure completely immersed in water containing chlorides
from sources other than seawater.
NOTE 5
Reinforced concrete elements at risk of reinforcement corrosion due to diffusion of chloride ions can
include the following:

CD 373 - ENAA Version 0.1.0
E/1. Application of hydrophobic impregnation syste...
1)
piers, columns, crossheads, abutments and exposed parts of substructure foundations within 10
metres of the edge of the carriageway subjected to deicing salt spray;
2)
piers, columns, crossheads and abutments with a deck joint above, but without a functioning
positive drainage system;
3)
the tops of piers, columns, crossheads and abutments with a deck joint above, but without a
functioning positive drainage system, where accessible;
4)
bearing shelves, screen walls, shear walls, ballast walls, deck diaphragms and deck ends with a
deck joint above, where accessible;
5)
concrete parapets, parapet plinths (all inclinations), parapet stringcourses and concrete deck top
surfaces not protected with deck waterproofing;
6)
parts of deck soffit directly over and within 8 metres vertically above the carriageway or 10 metres
horizontally of the edge of the carriageway; and/or
7)
walls within 10 metres of the edge of carriageway.
Proposal of existing concrete structures for Overseeing Organisation
agreement for the application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation (CD
373, 2.14)
E/1.4
Existing concrete structures satisfying any of the following eligibility categories shall be proposed as
candidates for application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation in a report for the Overseeing
Organisation's agreement:
1)
existing structures constructed after 2008 or modified elements of existing structures constructed
after 2008, that were not treated with hydrophobic impregnation, and where there is no evidence
of reinforcement corrosion or risk of reinforcement corrosion is assessed to be low in accordance
with CS 462 [Ref 4.N];
2)
existing structures constructed before 2009 or modified elements of existing structures
constructed before 2009 and known to have been treated with hydrophobic impregnation, where
there is evidence that reinforcement corrosion is active but is assessed to be low risk in
accordance with CS 462 [Ref 4.N];
3)
existing structures constructed before 2009 or modified elements of existing structures
constructed before 2009 without record of a previous application of hydrophobic impregnation,
where there is evidence that reinforcement corrosion is active but is assessed to be low risk in
accordance with CS 462 [Ref 4.N].
NOTE
Existing structures or modified elements of existing structures that have been repaired since original
construction can also be included provided the repairs are still intact with no detectable delamination
and the parent concrete complies with the above eligibility categories.
E/1.4.1
Hydrophobic impregnation should not be applied to any of the following:
1)
elements of existing structures containing defective concrete at greater than low risk of
reinforcement corrosion in accordance with CS 462 [Ref 4.N];
2)
elements of existing structures at risk of reinforcement corrosion containing repaired areas that
have spalled or are delaminated;
3)
elements of existing structures where there is documented evidence of a high risk of corrosion;
4)
elements of existing structures in which the reinforcement is protected by a cathodic protection
system.
Application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation on existing concrete
structures (CD 373, 2.15)
E/1.5
CD 373 [Ref 1.N] clause 2.15 shall not apply.
E/1.6
Where the application or reapplication of hydrophobic impregnation on the refurbishment of existing
concrete structures has been agreed in principle by the Overseeing Organisation, the condition of the
existing concrete substrate shall be confirmed by:

CD 373 - ENAA Version 0.1.0
E/1. Application of hydrophobic impregnation syste...
1)
examining the most recent Principal or General Inspection reports and, where available, the most
recent concrete investigation report; or
2)
undertaking a Special Inspection in accordance with CS 450 [Ref 2.N].
E/1.6.1
Where the previous concrete investigation report is unavailable, older than 5 years old or is invalid,
then the Special Inspection in accordance with CS 450 [Ref 2.N]should include concrete investigation
and testing in accordance with CS 462 [Ref 4.N]to assess and confirm a low risk of active ongoing
reinforcement corrosion prior to being proposed for the application of hydrophobic impregnation.
NOTE
Examples of where previous concrete investigation report is invalid include the following situations:
1)
where concrete repairs or cathodic protection have been implemented after the concrete
investigation have been undertaken; or
2)
where the condition of the structure has deteriorated further since the concrete investigation has
been undertaken.
