================================================================================

Issues Found: 3

- 1 MEDIUM priority issue (should fix)

================================================================================
TOP 3 ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE 1 (HIGH PRIORITY) - INCORRECT A101.4 QUOTATION
Location: Section 2.4, lines 204-206
Problem: Quotation incorrectly includes "plans examiner" in tenure protection
What It Says: "...chief inspector, an inspector or plans examiner..."
What It Should Say: "...chief inspector or inspector..." (no plans examiner)
Impact: Creates false legal protection for plans examiners
Fix: Replace quotation with accurate IBC 2024 A101.4 text

---

ISSUE 2 (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - A101.2 NEEDS CLARIFICATION
Location: Section 2.2, lines 145-166
Problem: IBC A101.2 discusses "supervisors" but file calls it "Chief Inspector"
         Missing mention of applicability to IMC, IPC, and IFGC codes
Impact: Could cause confusion about scope and applicability
Fix: Add explanatory note about terminology and code scope

---

ISSUE 3 (LOW PRIORITY) - MISSING CONTEXT IN A101.2
Location: Section 2.2
Problem: IBC A101.2 applies to multiple codes (IMC, IPC, IFGC) but not mentioned
Impact: Incomplete representation of A101.2 scope
Fix: Optional - Add note about applicable codes

Replace this:

holding a position shall not be removed from office except for cause and after
full opportunity to be heard on specific charges before the appointing authority."

With this (accurate IBC 2024 A101.4 text):
"Employees in the position of building official, chief inspector or inspector
shall not be removed from office except for cause after full opportunity has been
given to be heard on specific charges before such applicable governing authority."

CORRECTION 2: Add Clarification Note to Section 2.2
Add this note after the requirements:
"Note: IBC A101.2 uses the term 'supervisors' and applies to oversight of
International Building Code (IBC), International Mechanical Code (IMC),
International Plumbing Code (IPC), and International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC)."

CORRECTION 3: Add Verification Statement (RECOMMENDED)
Add this to document footer or preface:
"USA standards citations verified against IBC 2024 Appendix A (August 2024 edition)
on November 17, 2025."

PAKISTAN CONTEXT - ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Status: APPROPRIATE - No issues found

Alignments Verified:
