================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) 2020 is the mandatory national
building code for Bangladesh. It supersedes the previous BNBC 1993/2006 versions.
The code is required for structural engineering professionals, architects,
electrical engineers, fire protection designers, plumbing engineers, mechanical
engineers, and planners working in Bangladesh for the design and construction
of infrastructure.

TECHNICAL BASIS:
- Closely resembles ASCE 7-05 (American Society of Civil Engineers)
- Incorporates international best practices adapted for Bangladesh context
- Aligned with modern seismic design principles

================================================================================

NOTES FOR REGIONAL COMPARISON
================================================================================

SIMILARITIES TO PAKISTAN B&R CODE:
- Both countries share historical administrative frameworks from pre-1947 era
- Common law heritage and administrative structures
- Similar PWD organizational structures
