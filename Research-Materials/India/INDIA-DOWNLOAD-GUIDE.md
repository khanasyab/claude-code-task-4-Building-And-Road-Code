## ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:

**"Is it just the CPWD?"**

**NO!** India has **THREE main sources**:

1. **NBC** (like USA's IBC) - For buildings ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
2. **IRC** (like USA's AASHTO) - For roads/highways ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
3. **CPWD** (like USA's FAR) - For government procedures

**Start with:**
- NBC 2016 for buildings
- IRC standards for roads
- CPWD Specifications for construction methods

All three are equally important for a complete Building & Roads Code!
