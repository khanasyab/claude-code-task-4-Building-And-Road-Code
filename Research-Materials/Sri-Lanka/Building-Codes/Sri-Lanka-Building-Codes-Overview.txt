OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Sri Lanka does not have a single unified national building code like some countries.

4. Department of Buildings standards
5. Local authority regulations
6. Special purpose codes and guidelines

REGULATORY CONTEXT:
"In the Sri Lankan context sustainable building codes do exist but are not
always legally enforceable" - indicating a complex compliance landscape with
varying levels of enforcement.
