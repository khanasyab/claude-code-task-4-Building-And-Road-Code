## Key Findings Summary

### Regulatory Framework Overview

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Sri Lanka does NOT have a single unified national building code like Bangladesh or some other countries. Instead, the regulatory framework is distributed across multiple authorities:

1. Urban Development Authority (UDA) - Planning and building regulations
2. Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) - National standards
3. Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) - Public works specifications
4. Department of Buildings - Government building standards
5. Local Authorities - Municipal regulations

**Key Quote:** "In the Sri Lankan context sustainable building codes do exist but are not always legally enforceable" - indicating varying levels of enforcement.
