## 5. GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 5.1 Current Gaps (Minor)

**Limited Gaps Identified**:

1. **Cost Barrier**:
   - Core technical standards (Eurocodes, BS 7671, contracts) require purchase
   - Estimated £5,000-£10,000+ for complete set
   - **Impact**: MODERATE - Essential documents must be purchased
   - **Mitigation**: Free summaries created, university/professional body access

2. **Regional Variations**:
   - Scotland has separate Building Standards system
   - Northern Ireland has separate Building Regulations
   - Wales has some variations
   - **Impact**: LOW - Variations documented, specific research needed per region
   - **Mitigation**: README files note differences

3. **Transition Periods**:
   - Second-generation Eurocodes rolling out (2023-2028)
