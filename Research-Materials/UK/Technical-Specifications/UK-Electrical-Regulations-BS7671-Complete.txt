====================================================================================================
GAPS AND LIMITATIONS
====================================================================================================

1. COST
   - Standard must be purchased (not free like DMRB or some HSE guidance)
   - Essential reference for electrical work
   - Limits access for DIY and students

2. COMPLEXITY
   - Requires professional training to interpret correctly
   - Calculations can be complex
   - Special locations have specific requirements easily missed

3. RAPID TECHNOLOGY CHANGE
   - Amendments needed frequently for new technologies
   - Smart home technology evolving rapidly
   - EV charging developing fast
   - Energy storage systems emerging

4. RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION
   - Existing installations not required to meet current standards (unless altered)
   - Many older properties have substandard wiring
   - Periodic inspection identifies issues but doesn't mandate upgrades

5. ENFORCEMENT
   - Part P self-certification relies on competent person schemes
   - Building Control resources limited
   - Non-compliant work still occurs
   - Difficulty checking compliance for small jobs
