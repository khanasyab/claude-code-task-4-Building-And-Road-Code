====================================================================================================
OVERVIEW
====================================================================================================

The Structural Eurocodes (BS EN 1990-1999) have been the UK's national standards for structural
design since 2005. These replaced previous British Standards including BS 5950 (steel),
BS 8110 (concrete), and BS 5268 (timber).

The Eurocodes are published in the UK by BSI as BS EN standards, each accompanied by a UK
National Annex that provides country-specific parameters and implementation guidance.

   - Confusion about which version to use
   - Need to update references and training

4. MATERIAL-SPECIFIC GAPS

   - Composite materials beyond steel-concrete need attention
   - Sustainable materials emerging faster than standards

5. DIGITAL INTEGRATION
   - Standards still primarily PDF-based
   - Limited interactive tools within standards themselves
   - Software integration varies

====================================================================================================
