====================================================================================================
OVERVIEW
====================================================================================================

The UK construction industry uses three main families of standard form contracts:

1. JCT (Joint Contracts Tribunal) - Dominant in UK building sector, especially private
2. NEC (New Engineering Contract) - Popular in UK public sector and infrastructure
3. FIDIC (International Federation of Consulting Engineers) - International projects

Each has different philosophy, structure, and application.

Public procurement is governed by:
- Procurement Act 2023 (effective 24 February 2025)
- Previously: Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015)
