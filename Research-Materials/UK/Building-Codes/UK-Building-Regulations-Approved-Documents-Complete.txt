GAPS AND LIMITATIONS
====================================================================================================

1. REGIONAL VARIATIONS
   - Different systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland require separate research
   - Wales has some variations that need checking

2. DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS
   - Approved Documents provide principles; detailed specifications often require
     reference to British Standards (which are not free)
   - Some BS standards are expensive to purchase

3. RAPID EVOLUTION
   - Building standards evolving quickly (especially energy efficiency and fire safety)
   - Need to verify you have latest version before use
   - Transition to second-generation Eurocodes by 2028

4. PRACTICAL APPLICATION
   - Approved Documents show compliance methods but not always the only or best methods
   - Professional interpretation often required for complex projects

5. DIGITAL TOOLS
   - Could benefit from more interactive digital tools and calculators
   - Some guidance still relies on manual calculations

====================================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
====================================================================================================

Priority Areas:
1. Obtain copies of key British Standards referenced in Approved Documents
2. Research second-generation Eurocodes (BS EN 1990:2023 onwards)
3. Gather CIBSE guidance documents for building services
4. Collect CIRIA publications for specialist topics
5. Obtain Scottish Building Standards Technical Handbooks for comparison
6. Research BRE publications for detailed technical guidance

Specialized Topics:
1. Fire engineering - BS 9999, PD 7974 series
2. Historic buildings - BS 7913
3. Sustainable construction - BREEAM, Code for Sustainable Homes
4. Acoustics - BB93 (schools), HTM 08-01 (healthcare)
