## Comparison to Master Index Topics

### Coverage Alignment with Pakistan B&R Code

| Topic Category | IBC Coverage | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Administrative procedures | Comprehensive (Chapter 1) | Similar scope to B&R Code Chapter 1 |
| Building classification | Extensive (Chapters 3-6) | More detailed than B&R Code |
| Structural design | Comprehensive (Chapters 16-23) | Performance-based approach |
| Fire safety | Extensive (Chapters 7-9) | More stringent than B&R Code |
| Means of egress | Comprehensive (Chapter 10) | Detailed requirements |
| Accessibility | Comprehensive (Chapter 11) | ADA compliance |
| Building systems | Good coverage (Chapters 27-30) | References other codes |
| Construction safety | Basic (Chapter 33) | More detail in OSHA standards |
| Materials specifications | Comprehensive (Chapters 18-26) | Material-specific chapters |

## Key Differences from Historical B&R Codes
1. **Performance-based provisions**: IBC allows alternative compliance methods
2. **Seismic design**: Comprehensive seismic provisions throughout
3. **Accessibility**: Extensive requirements for disabled access
4. **Energy efficiency**: Integrated energy requirements
5. **Regular updates**: 3-year cycle vs. decades for older codes
6. **Consensus process**: Developed through public hearings and votes

## Reference Standards
The IBC references over 300 standards from organizations including:
- ASTM International
- American Concrete Institute (ACI)
- American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC)
- American Wood Council (AWC)
- NFPA (National Fire Protection Association)
- ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers)

## Document Quality: GOLD STANDARD
- **Comprehensiveness**: 10/10
- **Technical rigor**: 10/10
- **Clarity**: 9/10
