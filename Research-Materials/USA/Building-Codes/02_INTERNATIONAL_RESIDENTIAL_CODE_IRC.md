| Building classification | Residential only | Limited vs B&R Code |
| Foundation design | Prescriptive (Ch 4) | More detailed tables |
| Structural design | Prescriptive (Ch 3-9) | Pre-calculated solutions |
| Fire safety | Basic residential (throughout) | Less stringent than IBC |
| Mechanical systems | Complete (Ch 12-24) | Integrated approach |
| Plumbing systems | Complete (Ch 25-33) | Stand-alone provisions |

| Energy efficiency | Comprehensive (Ch 11) | Modern requirement |

## Key Advantages
1. **Self-contained**: One code covers all aspects
2. **Prescriptive**: Easy to use without engineering
3. **Span tables**: Pre-calculated for common applications
4. **Widely adopted**: Used throughout U.S.
5. **Regularly updated**: Current with technology
6. **User-friendly**: Organized for contractors and builders

## Key Differences from B&R Code
1. **Scope**: Residential only vs. all buildings
2. **Approach**: Prescriptive vs. primarily performance
3. **Integration**: All trades in one code
4. **Updates**: 3-year cycle vs. decades
5. **Accessibility**: Modern requirements included
6. **Energy**: Mandatory efficiency provisions
7. **Detail**: Extensive span tables and details

## Important Notes
- IRC is for residential construction only
- More complex residential buildings use IBC
- State amendments may modify requirements significantly
- Local jurisdictions may adopt specific editions
- Always check local code adoption
