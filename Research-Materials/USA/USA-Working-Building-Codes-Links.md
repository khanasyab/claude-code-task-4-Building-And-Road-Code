3. **Check Public Libraries** - Many have code books available
4. **University Access** - Some universities provide access through library subscriptions

## Recommended Workflow

### For Research and Reference (Pakistan Building Code Development)
1. **Primary Source:** Use UpCodes (https://up.codes)
   - Can copy/paste relevant sections
   - Better for research and comparison
   - Includes multiple editions for historical comparison

2. **Verification:** Cross-check with ICC Digital Codes (https://codes.iccsafe.org)
   - Official source for final verification
   - Use when official citation needed

3. **Specific Sections:** Use Construction Yeti links for direct access to specific codes

### For Downloading Content

## Legal Note

All I-Codes are copyrighted by ICC but are legally available for free viewing under the "government edicts doctrine" when adopted by jurisdictions. UpCodes successfully defended this in court. While you can view and reference these codes freely, selling or distributing complete copies may violate copyright.

For research and development of Pakistan's Building & Roads Code, viewing and referencing specific sections is legally acceptable under fair use.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use UpCodes (https://up.codes) as your primary resource. It's free, legal, more user-friendly than ICC's site, and allows you to actually work with the content (copy/paste).
