### Final Recommendations

For anyone researching modern building and road codes:

1. **Start with free access codes** (OSHA, FAR, FHWA, GSA)
2. **View I-Codes online free** at codes.iccsafe.org
3. **Invest in AASHTO standards** for highway/bridge work
4. **Purchase NEC** for detailed electrical reference
5. **Use these research documents** as comprehensive guides to code structure and content
6. **Verify local adoption** before applying any code
7. **Stay current** with 3-year update cycles
