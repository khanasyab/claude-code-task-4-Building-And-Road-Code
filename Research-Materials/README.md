## Research Agent Coordination

If you are a research agent populating these folders:

1. **Prioritize critical topics first** (see COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md Section 5.1)
2. **Focus on official sources:** Government codes > Manuals > Standards > Guidelines
3. **Preferred countries for specific topics:**
   - Administrative procedures: India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka
   - Building codes: UK, USA, India
   - Contract systems: All countries + FIDIC
   - Road standards: India (IRC), UK (DMRB), USA (AASHTO)
   - Safety: UK (CDM), USA (OSHA)
   - Technical specs: UK (BS), USA (ASTM), India (IS)

4. **Document naming:** Use descriptive names with source and date
   Example: `India_CPWD_Works_Manual_2019.pdf`

5. **Save metadata:** Include source URL, access date, and brief description
