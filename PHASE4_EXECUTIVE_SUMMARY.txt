NEXT STEPS / RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Immediate:
✓ File ready for final publication in BNR 2025
✓ Correction log archived for audit trail
✓ All Phase 3 audit findings resolved

Optional (for continuous improvement):
□ Consider peer review of corrections before formal publication
□ Update version control metadata to reflect Phase 4 completion
□ Ensure cross-referenced files (1.1E SOW, 1.1D DO) undergo similar Phase 4
  corrections if pending
□ Archive all audit reports and correction logs together

Future:
□ Apply lessons learned to other BNR 2025 chapters
  - Always verify source document versions before citation
  - Use complete quotations for legal/code provisions
  - Maintain sacred base text exactly as published
  - Add applicability notes for context-specific provisions

================================================================================
LESSONS LEARNED - PHASE 4 INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. BNR-1994 vs BNR-1989 Confusion
   Issue: Source identified as BNR 1994 but actual text from BNR 1989
   Resolution: Restored exact text regardless of version discrepancy
   Lesson: Always verify source document version before making claims

2. Quotation Completeness Critical
   Issue: Partial quotations presented as complete (USA citations)
   Resolution: Added all missing text from IBC 2024 source
   Lesson: If quoting, quote completely or use ellipsis (...) for omissions

3. Paraphrasing Legal Text Problematic
   Issue: Section 104.8 paraphrase oversimplified legal protection
   Resolution: Replaced with full IBC 2024 quotation
   Lesson: Legal and code provisions should be quoted exactly, not paraphrased

4. Version Tracking Essential
   Issue: UK DMRB CG 300 version stated as "October 2024" (wrong)
   Resolution: Corrected to "Version 0.2.2 (30 September 2025)"
   Lesson: Track exact version numbers for all cited standards

5. Cross-References Add Value
   Issue: Minor observation to improve integration between sections
   Resolution: Added explicit cross-references in two locations
   Lesson: Readers benefit from clear signposting to related content
