- Green roofs or cool roofs
- Building orientation for passive cooling
- Natural ventilation strategies
- Energy management systems

WATER EFFICIENCY:

Mandatory Measures:
- Water-efficient fixtures (low-flow taps, dual-flush toilets)
- Rainwater harvesting (minimum 50% of roof area)
- Wastewater recycling for non-potable uses
- Leak detection systems

Rainwater Harvesting:
- Mandatory for buildings > 500 m² roof area
- Storage capacity: Minimum 10-20 liters per m² of roof area
- Use for toilet flushing, landscaping, washing

SUSTAINABLE SITE DEVELOPMENT:

Requirements:
- Preserve existing trees (where feasible)
- Native or drought-resistant landscaping
- Minimize impervious surfaces
- On-site storm water management
- Erosion and sediment control during construction

MATERIALS AND RESOURCES:

Preferences:
- Locally sourced materials (within 500 km)
- Recycled content materials
- Rapidly renewable materials
- Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) paints and finishes
- Construction waste management and recycling

INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY:

Requirements:
- Adequate natural ventilation and air circulation
- Daylighting for occupied spaces
- Control of indoor pollutants
- Thermal comfort
- Acoustic comfort

5.4 IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE

CERTIFICATION PROCESS:

Step 1: Design Phase
- Incorporate green features in design
- Register with GBCSL or LEED
- Submit preliminary documentation

Step 2: Construction Phase
- Implement green features as designed
- Document construction practices
- Material verification

Step 3: Commissioning
- Test and verify systems
- Energy and water performance verification
- Indoor environmental quality testing

Step 4: Certification
- Submit final documentation
- Third-party review
- Certification award

COST IMPLICATIONS:

Additional Costs:
- 5-10% higher initial construction cost (typical)
- Certification fees and consultant charges

Lifecycle Benefits:
- 30-40% energy savings (operational cost reduction)
- 40-50% water savings
- Improved occupant health and productivity
- Higher property value and marketability
- Reduced maintenance costs
