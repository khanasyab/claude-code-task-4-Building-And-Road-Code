CHAPTER 9: ROAD SAFETY STANDARDS
======================================================================

9.1 ROAD SAFETY FRAMEWORK

Road safety in Sri Lanka is governed by multiple agencies:
- Road Development Authority (infrastructure safety)
- Traffic Management and Road Safety Division, Sri Lanka Police
- Motor Traffic Department (vehicle standards, licensing)
- National Council for Road Safety

Challenges:
- High accident rates compared to international standards
- Mixed traffic (vehicles, motorcycles, pedestrians, animals)
- Limited enforcement of design standards
- Lack of mandatory road safety audits

9.2 ROAD SAFETY ENGINEERING

SAFETY IN DESIGN:

Principles:
- Forgiving roadside design
- Clear zone provision
- Hazard removal or protection
- Adequate sight distance
- Appropriate speed management
- Intersection design for safety

Implementation Gaps:
- Minimum safety standards for road designs rarely followed
- Road safety audits not mandatory
- Limited budget for safety improvements

TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES:
- Speed humps in residential areas
- Rumble strips on approaches
- Raised pedestrian crossings
- Narrow lane widths in low-speed zones

PEDESTRIAN SAFETY:
- Sidewalks and footpaths
- Pedestrian crossings (marked)
- Pedestrian bridges and underpasses (at major locations)
- Bus shelters and waiting areas
- School zone protection

9.3 ROAD FURNITURE AND MARKINGS

ROAD MARKINGS:

Types:
- Center line markings
- Edge line markings
- Lane dividers
- Pedestrian crossings (zebra crossings)
- Stop lines
- Directional arrows and text
- Hatched areas

Materials:
- Thermoplastic paint (most common)
- Cold plastic (long-lasting)
- Reflectorized beads for night visibility

TRAFFIC SIGNS:

Categories:
- Regulatory signs (mandatory instructions)
- Warning signs (hazard alerts)
- Informatory signs (guidance)
- Temporary signs (construction zones)

Standards:
- Design based on international conventions
- Retroreflective materials for night visibility
- Standardized colors and symbols
- Appropriate size based on road speed

ROADSIDE BARRIERS:

Types:
- Steel W-beam guard rails
- Concrete barriers (rigid)
- Tensioned cable barriers
- Crash cushions at fixed objects

Applications:
- High fills and embankments
- Bridge approaches
- Sharp curves
- Protection of roadside hazards

CHAPTER 10: MAINTENANCE STANDARDS
======================================================================

10.1 MAINTENANCE CATEGORIES

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE:
- Frequency: Continuous or annual
- Activities: Pothole patching, crack sealing, drainage cleaning,
  grass cutting, sign maintenance
- Objective: Prevent deterioration, ensure operational safety

PERIODIC MAINTENANCE:
- Frequency: 5-10 years
- Activities: Overlay, surface treatment, pavement rehabilitation
- Objective: Restore structural integrity and riding quality

EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
- Triggered by: Accidents, natural disasters, sudden failures
- Activities: Immediate repairs, temporary fixes, traffic management
- Objective: Restore traffic flow and ensure safety

10.2 PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES

CRACK SEALING:
- Material: Hot pour crack sealant or bitumen emulsion
- Application: Clean cracks, fill with sealant
- Prevents water infiltration

POTHOLE PATCHING:
- Material: Hot mix asphalt or cold mix asphalt
- Method: Clean, tack coat, compact fill material
- Temporary (cold mix) or permanent (hot mix)

SURFACE DRESSING:
- Restores surface texture and waterproofing
- Extends pavement life by 5-7 years
- Cost-effective preventive maintenance

OVERLAY:
- Asphalt overlay: 30-50 mm thickness
- Improves structural capacity and smoothness
- Addresses rutting and surface deterioration

FULL DEPTH RECLAMATION:
- Severe pavement failures
- Remove and replace failed layers
- Reconstruct to original or improved standard

10.3 BRIDGE MAINTENANCE

INSPECTION PROGRAM:
- Routine inspection: Annual
- Principal inspection: Every 5 years
- Special inspection: After floods, earthquakes, or damage events

COMMON MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES:
- Expansion joint repair and replacement
- Bearing maintenance and replacement
- Deck waterproofing
- Concrete repair (spalling, cracks)
- Painting of steel elements
- Drainage system cleaning
- Pier and abutment repairs
- Scour monitoring and protection
