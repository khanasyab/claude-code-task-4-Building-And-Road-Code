======================================================================
CHAPTER 3: KEY GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES FOR SRI LANKA
======================================================================

3.1 PASSIVE DESIGN STRATEGIES

BUILDING ORIENTATION:

Optimal Orientation:
- Long axis East-West to minimize East and West sun exposure
- North and South facades receive less direct sun in tropics
- Reduces cooling load significantly

Shading:
- Overhangs and fins on windows
- External shading devices (louvers, pergolas)
- Vegetation (trees, climbing plants)

NATURAL VENTILATION:

Cross Ventilation:
- Openable windows on opposite sides
- Prevailing wind utilization (Southwest monsoon, Northeast monsoon)
- Stack effect (hot air rises, exits through high openings)

Design Considerations:
- Window size and placement
- Interior layout (minimize obstructions)
- Ceiling height (higher ceilings improve air circulation)

THERMAL MASS:

Concept:
- Massive materials (concrete, brick) store heat
- Release slowly, moderating temperature swings
- Effective in climates with day-night temperature variation

Application:
- Exposed concrete or masonry walls and floors
- Night cooling (ventilate at night to remove stored heat)

INSULATION:

Roof Insulation:
- Critical in tropical climate (roof receives most solar radiation)
- Insulation materials: Rockwool, glasswool, polystyrene, polyurethane
- Thickness: 50-100 mm typical
- Reduces heat gain by 40-60%

Wall Insulation:
- Less critical than roof but beneficial
- Cavity walls with insulation
- Reflective barriers

COOL ROOFS:

Reflective Surfaces:
- White or light-colored roofs reflect solar radiation
- Reduces roof surface temperature by 20-30°C
- Reduces cooling load

Green Roofs:
- Vegetation on roof
- Insulation, evaporative cooling, rainwater management
- Higher cost and maintenance

3.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY

LIGHTING:

Daylighting:
- Maximize natural light penetration
- Windows, skylights, light shelves, clerestory windows
- Reduces artificial lighting need during day
- Daylight sensors and controls

Efficient Artificial Lighting:
- LED lamps (80-120 lumens/watt efficiency)
- Replace CFLs and fluorescents
- Long life (50,000+ hours)
- Task lighting (localized lighting rather than over-lighting entire space)

Lighting Controls:
- Occupancy sensors (switch off when unoccupied)
- Daylight sensors (dim when sufficient daylight)
- Timers for outdoor and common area lighting
- Zoning (control lighting in sections)

AIR CONDITIONING:

Efficient Systems:
- Inverter technology air conditioners (variable speed compressor)
- Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER)
- Select units with high EER (>3.0) or Energy Star rating

System Design:
- Proper sizing (avoid oversizing)
- Zoning (independent control of different areas)
- Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems for large buildings
- Regular maintenance (clean filters, coils)

Temperature Setpoint:
- 24-25°C (avoid excessive cooling to 18-20°C)
- Each degree higher saves ~5-10% energy

RENEWABLE ENERGY:

Solar Photovoltaic (PV):
- Most viable renewable energy in Sri Lanka
- Rooftop solar systems (1-10 kW residential, 10-1000+ kW commercial)

- Payback period: 5-8 years typically
- Government incentives and net metering regulations

Solar Water Heating:
- Simple and cost-effective
- Flat plate or evacuated tube collectors
- 80-90% of water heating energy from solar
- Payback: 2-4 years
- Mandatory for some building types (hotels, hospitals)

Other Renewables:
- Wind energy (limited to specific locations)
- Micro-hydro (hilly areas with water resources)
- Biomass (organic waste to energy)

BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (BMS):

Automation:
- Centralized monitoring and control
