======================================================================
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO EUROCODES IN SRI LANKA
======================================================================

1.1 BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT:
Prior to 2010, Sri Lanka relied primarily on British Standards (BS) for
structural design. However, when British Standards Institution announced
the withdrawal and cessation of updates to BS codes, Sri Lanka faced the
need to adopt alternative design standards.

After comprehensive review, Sri Lanka decided to adopt the Eurocodes
(European Standards for structural design) as the primary structural
design standards for the country.

1.2 WHY EUROCODES?

The Eurocodes were selected because:

a) MODERN AND COMPREHENSIVE:
   - State-of-the-art design methods
   - Comprehensive coverage of structural types
   - Based on limit state design philosophy
   - Incorporates latest research

b) FLEXIBILITY FOR NATIONAL ADAPTATION:
   - National Annexes allow country-specific parameters
   - Accommodation of local conditions
   - Flexibility in safety factors
   - Regional seismic and climate considerations

c) INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION:
   - Widely adopted globally
   - Facilitates international practice
   - Supports technology transfer
   - Enables professional mobility

d) TECHNICAL SUPERIORITY:
   - Performance-based approach
   - Rational design procedures
   - Extensive validation
   - Regular updates

1.3 STRUCTURE OF EUROCODES

The Eurocode system consists of 10 main codes:

EN 1990: Basis of Structural Design
EN 1991: Actions on Structures (8 parts)

1.4 NATIONAL ANNEXES

Each Eurocode includes Nationally Determined Parameters (NDPs) that
allow countries to specify values appropriate for their conditions.

Sri Lanka National Annexes (NA to SLS EN) provide:
- Seismic parameters for Sri Lankan conditions

- Adaptation to Sri Lankan conditions
- International best practices
- Professional development opportunities
- Enhanced structural safety

All structural engineers, architects, and construction professionals
