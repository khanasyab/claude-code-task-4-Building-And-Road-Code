- Columns: Maximum spacing of links = lesser of (12 × main bar diameter, 300 mm)

INSTALLATION PRACTICES:

Bar Fixing:
- Clean bars before placement (remove rust, oil, mud)
- Use binding wire (16-18 gauge) for tying
- Ensure correct position and spacing
- Maintain specified cover using spacers/chairs

Spacers and Chairs:
- Concrete spacer blocks
- Plastic chairs/spacers
- Metal bar chairs (with corrosion protection)
- Frequency: Every 1-1.5 m spacing

Inspection Before Concreting:
- Verify bar sizes, numbers, and positions
- Check cover and spacing
- Ensure no displacement of bars
- Clean formwork and reinforcement

CHAPTER 5: AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE AND CONSTRUCTION
======================================================================

5.1 TYPES OF AGGREGATES

FINE AGGREGATE (SAND):
- Particle size: Passing 4.75 mm sieve
- Natural sand: River sand, pit sand
- Manufactured sand (M-sand): Crushed rock fines
- Applications: Concrete, mortar, plaster

COARSE AGGREGATE:
- Particle size: Retained on 4.75 mm sieve
- Crushed rock aggregate (most common)
- Natural gravel (limited use)
- Sizes: 10 mm, 20 mm, 40 mm (nominal maximum size)

5.2 AGGREGATE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:

Gradation:
- Well-graded aggregates for maximum density
- Fineness modulus for sand: 2.3-3.1
- Meets grading limits per specifications

Particle Shape:
- Cubical or rounded preferred
- Avoid flaky and elongated particles
- Flakiness Index: ≤25% (for structural concrete)
- Elongation Index: ≤25%

Strength and Toughness:
- Los Angeles Abrasion Value: ≤30% (structural concrete), ≤25% (pavement)
- Aggregate Impact Value: ≤25% (structural), ≤20% (heavy-duty pavement)
- Aggregate Crushing Value: ≤30% (normal), ≤20% (high strength)

Soundness:
- Sodium sulfate soundness: ≤12% (after 5 cycles)
- Magnesium sulfate soundness: ≤18%
- Tests resistance to weathering

Specific Gravity:
- Normal weight aggregate: 2.6-2.7
- Lightweight aggregate: <2.0
- Heavyweight aggregate: >3.0

Water Absorption:
- Maximum: 2% (structural concrete)
- Maximum: 3% (general concrete)
- Affects mix water requirement

DELETERIOUS SUBSTANCES:

Organic Impurities:
- Colorimetric test for sand
- Color lighter than standard
- Affects concrete setting and strength

Silt and Clay:
- Maximum in sand: 3-5% (concrete), 8% (masonry mortar)
- Maximum in coarse aggregate: 1%

Chlorides:
- Maximum chloride content: 0.05% (prestressed), 0.1% (reinforced)
- Critical for marine structures

Sulfates:
- Maximum sulfate content: 0.5% (as SO₃)
- Causes expansion and deterioration

5.3 AGGREGATE TESTING

STANDARD TESTS:

Sieve Analysis (Gradation):
- Standard sieves: 40, 20, 10, 4.75, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6, 0.3, 0.15 mm
- Determine particle size distribution
- Calculate fineness modulus

Los Angeles Abrasion Test:
- 500 revolutions in rotating drum with steel balls
- Measures toughness and abrasion resistance
- Material passing 1.7 mm sieve = abrasion loss percentage

Aggregate Impact Value:
- Drop hammer test (14 kg weight, 380 mm drop)
- Measures toughness
- Material passing 2.36 mm sieve = impact value percentage

Aggregate Crushing Value:
- Compression test to 400 kN load
- Measures crushing resistance
- Material passing 2.36 mm sieve = crushing value percentage

Flakiness Index:
- Percentage of flaky particles (thickness < 0.6 × mean size)
- Uses thickness gauge

Elongation Index:
- Percentage of elongated particles (length > 1.8 × mean size)
- Uses length gauge

Specific Gravity and Water Absorption:
- Oven-dry weight, saturated surface-dry weight, submerged weight
- Calculate bulk specific gravity and absorption

Soundness Test:
- Immersion in sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate solution
- 5 cycles of immersion and drying
- Loss after test = soundness value

5.4 AGGREGATE SOURCES IN SRI LANKA

CRUSHED ROCK:
- Granite quarries (most common)
- Metamorphic rocks
- Quality depends on parent rock
- Major sources: Central highlands, North Central Province

RIVER SAND:

- Environmentally sensitive extraction
- Regulations on river sand mining
- Decreasing availability

MANUFACTURED SAND (M-SAND):
- Produced by crushing rock to sand size
- Growing use due to river sand scarcity
- Quality control important
- Gradation and fines content critical

IMPORTED AGGREGATES:
- For special applications
- High-quality crushed rock
- Lightweight aggregates (limited use)
