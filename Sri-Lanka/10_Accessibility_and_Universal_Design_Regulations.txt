1. Equitable Use
2. Flexibility in Use
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
4. Perceptible Information
5. Tolerance for Error
6. Low Physical Effort
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

2.2 TYPES OF DISABILITIES

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR:

MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS:
- Wheelchair users
- Crutch and cane users
- Limited mobility
- Requirements: Ramps, lifts, wide doorways, accessible toilets

VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS:
- Blind and low vision
- Requirements: Tactile indicators, Braille signage, auditory signals,
  adequate lighting, color contrast

HEARING IMPAIRMENTS:
