DOCUMENT INFORMATION
---------------------
Title: Seismic Design and Earthquake Resistant Construction in Sri Lanka
Primary Reference: Society of Structural Engineers Sri Lanka - "Earthquake Resistant Detailing for Buildings in Sri Lanka"
Design Codes: Eurocode 8 (BS EN 1998-1:2004), Indian Standard IS 1893, Australian Standard AS 1170.4
Status: Guidelines available, comprehensive code under development
Seismic Hazard: Very low to low (but increasing awareness needed)

======================================================================
CHAPTER 1: SEISMIC HAZARD IN SRI LANKA
======================================================================

1.1 HISTORICAL CONTEXT

TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION:
Historically, Sri Lanka was considered a region with minimal seismic
risk, located away from major plate boundaries and seismic zones.

CHANGING REALITY:
Recent seismic events and studies indicate that Sri Lanka can no longer
be considered completely safe from seismic threats:
- Minor earthquakes recorded in recent years
- Effects from distant major earthquakes (e.g., 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami)
- Increased awareness of seismic vulnerability
- Recognition of need for seismic design provisions

1.2 SEISMIC HAZARD CLASSIFICATION

CURRENT ASSESSMENT:
According to international hazard maps (ThinkHazard and others):
- Very low to low earthquake hazard
- Less than 2% probability of potentially-damaging earthquake shaking
  in any given project area over the next 50 years
- However, this does not eliminate the need for seismic considerations

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO HAZARD:
- Proximity to Indian Plate boundary
- Deep-seated faults within Sri Lankan region
- Possibility of induced seismicity
- Far-field effects from major earthquakes

1.3 HISTORICAL SEISMIC EVENTS

RECORDED EARTHQUAKES:
- Minor tremors recorded periodically
- Magnitude typically <5.0 on Richter scale
- Limited structural damage historically
- Increasing seismological monitoring

2004 INDIAN OCEAN EARTHQUAKE:
- Magnitude 9.1 earthquake (off Sumatra)
- Tsunami effects in Sri Lanka
- Demonstrated vulnerability to far-field events
- Wake-up call for disaster preparedness

1.4 CURRENT STATE OF SEISMIC DESIGN

CHALLENGES:
- No comprehensive seismic design code specific to Sri Lanka
- Limited local seismic data and hazard studies
- Only available document: "Earthquake Resistant Detailing for
  Buildings in Sri Lanka" (Society of Structural Engineers, Sri Lanka)
- Many existing buildings not designed for seismic resistance
- Increasing awareness but limited implementation

DESIGN PRACTICE:
- Structural designers have historically not paid sufficient attention
  to seismic performance
- Many existing structures have undesirable features for seismic resistance
- Growing recognition of need for seismic provisions
- Gradual adoption of international standards

======================================================================
CHAPTER 2: APPLICABLE CODES AND STANDARDS

======================================================================

3.1 PROPOSED SEISMIC ZONES

Based on limited seismic studies, tentative zoning proposed:

ZONE 1 (VERY LOW SEISMIC HAZARD):
Regions: Most of central and southern Sri Lanka
Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA): 0.05g to 0.08g
Zone Factor: Z = 0.10

ZONE 3 (MODERATE - SPECIAL AREAS):
Regions: Areas near identified fault lines (if any)
Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA): 0.12g to 0.16g
Zone Factor: Z = 0.16 to 0.24
Characteristics: Localized higher risk

NOTE:
These values are preliminary and subject to revision based on detailed
seismic hazard studies. Comprehensive seismic microzonation needed.
