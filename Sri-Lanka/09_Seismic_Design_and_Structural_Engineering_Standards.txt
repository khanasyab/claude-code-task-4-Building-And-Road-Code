SRI LANKA SEISMIC DESIGN AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING STANDARDS
EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN CODES
======================================================================

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
--------------------
Standards Development: Society of Structural Engineers Sri Lanka (SSESL)
Technical Support: National Building Research Organisation (NBRO)
Design Codes: British Standards, Eurocodes, Australian Standards, Indian Standards
Professional Body: Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL)
Guidelines: "Earthquake Resistant Detailing for Buildings in Sri Lanka" (SSESL)

======================================================================
CHAPTER 1: SEISMIC HAZARD ASSESSMENT FOR SRI LANKA
======================================================================

1.1 SEISMIC RISK CLASSIFICATION

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:

Traditional View:
- Sri Lanka has long been considered a country safe from seismic threats
- Located away from major tectonic plate boundaries
- Very few recorded significant earthquakes in historical records
- Structural designs traditionally did not include seismic provisions

Current Understanding:
- Recent seismic events in and around the island have changed this perception
- 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake (magnitude 9.1) - Though epicenter far away,
  affected Sri Lanka with tsunami and some ground shaking
- Other regional seismic activities have prompted reconsideration
- Sri Lanka can no longer be considered completely safe from seismic threats

SEISMIC HAZARD CLASSIFICATION:

International Classification:
- Sri Lanka is classified as a VERY LOW seismic hazard zone
- Less than 2% chance of potentially damaging earthquake shaking in next 50 years

Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA):
- PGA < 0.1g (where g = acceleration due to gravity)
- Among the lowest seismic zones globally

Comparison:
- Much lower seismic risk than countries like Japan, Chile, Turkey, Nepal, Iran
- Lower than many parts of India, especially Himalayan region
- Similar to parts of Australia, Africa, and stable continental interiors

IMPLICATION FOR DESIGN:

RDA Bridge Design:
- Bridges in Sri Lanka do not need to be designed for effects due to earthquakes
- Sri Lanka not in a zone significantly affected by earthquakes
- However, recent guidelines suggest considering basic seismic principles for
  critical infrastructure

Building Design:
- No comprehensive seismic design guidelines mandatory
- Not part of standard building code requirements
- Important and critical structures may voluntarily include seismic provisions
- Growing awareness leading to gradual adoption

1.2 SEISMIC SOURCES AND POTENTIAL SCENARIOS

REGIONAL TECTONIC SETTING:

Distant Sources:
- Sumatra subduction zone (west) - 1,000+ km away
- Andaman-Nicobar region
- Myanmar (Burma) region
- Can generate large earthquakes but ground shaking attenuates significantly
  over distance

Local/Regional Faults:
- Some faults identified in Sri Lanka (Mahiyangana fault, Balangoda fault, etc.)
- Generally considered inactive or very low activity
- Potential for small to moderate earthquakes (M < 6.0)

Induced Seismicity:
- Large reservoir-induced seismicity (rare, low magnitude)
- Mining-induced seismicity (localized, minimal impact)

SCENARIO EARTHQUAKES:

Potential Scenarios for Design Consideration:

Scenario 1 - Distant Large Earthquake:
- Magnitude 8.5-9.0 in Sumatra region
- Long duration shaking (several minutes)
- Low intensity at Sri Lanka (PGA ~ 0.02-0.05g)
- Long period ground motion

Scenario 2 - Moderate Regional Earthquake:
- Magnitude 6.0-6.5 within Sri Lanka or near coast
- Short duration shaking (tens of seconds)
- Moderate intensity locally (PGA ~ 0.1-0.15g)
- Could cause localized damage

Design Approach:
- Consider Scenario 2 for important structures
- Focus on ductility and robustness rather than high design forces

======================================================================
CHAPTER 2: SEISMIC DESIGN CODES AND STANDARDS
======================================================================

2.1 ABSENCE OF SRI LANKA SPECIFIC SEISMIC CODE

CURRENT STATUS:

No Comprehensive National Seismic Code:
- No comprehensive studies to develop seismic analysis and design guidelines
  specifically for Sri Lankan conditions
- No mandatory seismic design requirements in building regulations
- Only available document: "Earthquake Resistant Detailing for Buildings in
  Sri Lanka" published by Society of Structural Engineers Sri Lanka (brief guidelines)

Implications:
- Engineers use international codes adapted to local context
- Inconsistency in approach among different projects
- Uncertainty in selection of seismic parameters

INTERNATIONAL CODES COMMONLY USED:

When seismic design is undertaken (for important structures), engineers in
Sri Lanka commonly consider three codes of practice:

1. Euro Code 8 (EN 1998-1:2004):
   - Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance
   - Part 1: General rules, seismic actions, and rules for buildings
   - European standard widely adopted

2. Indian Standard (IS 1893 Part 1:2002 or IS 1893:2016):
   - Criteria for Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures
   - Geographically close, similar construction practices
   - Zone II (lowest seismic zone) parameters sometimes used

3. Australian Standard (AS 1170.4-2007):
   - Structural Design Actions - Part 4: Earthquake actions
   - Modern code with good provisions for low seismicity areas

Selection Rationale:
- Euro Code 8 selected for many projects as it allows national choices in defining
  seismic characteristics (PGA, response spectra, etc.)
- Can adapt parameters to Sri Lankan conditions
- IS code familiar to many Sri Lankan engineers trained in India

2.2 TRANSITION FROM BRITISH STANDARDS TO EUROCODES

HISTORICAL PRACTICE:

British Standards:
- Structural engineers in Sri Lanka traditionally used British Standards (BS) for design
- BS 8110 for concrete structures
- BS 5950 for steel structures
- Familiar and well-established

Withdrawal of British Standards:
- British Standards Institution decided to withdraw and make no further updates to
  BS structural codes in 2010
- Transition to Eurocodes (EN standards) in UK and many former Commonwealth countries

ADOPTION OF EUROCODES IN SRI LANKA:

Gradual Transition:
- Sri Lankan engineers increasingly adopting Eurocodes
- EN 1990: Basis of Structural Design
- EN 1991: Actions on Structures (loads)
- EN 1992: Design of Concrete Structures
- EN 1993: Design of Steel Structures
- EN 1994: Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures
- EN 1995: Design of Timber Structures
- EN 1996: Design of Masonry Structures
- EN 1997: Geotechnical Design
- EN 1998: Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance
- EN 1999: Design of Aluminium Structures

Advantages:
- Modern codes with latest research and developments
- Comprehensive coverage
- Seismic design provisions (EN 1998)
- International acceptance

Challenges:
- Learning curve for engineers
- Different format and philosophy (Limit State Design)
- Availability of National Annexes (Sri Lanka does not have official Annexes, so
  default values or engineering judgment used)

2.3 SEISMIC DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

PRINCIPLES OF SEISMIC DESIGN:

Life Safety:
- Primary goal: Prevent collapse and loss of life during earthquake
- Structure may sustain damage but should not collapse
- Acceptable performance philosophy

Performance Levels:

Serviceability Limit State (Frequent/Minor Earthquake):
- No structural damage
- Minimal non-structural damage
- Building remains operational
- Return period: 50-100 years

Ultimate Limit State (Design Earthquake):
- Some structural damage acceptable (repairable)
- Significant non-structural damage possible
- No collapse, life safety ensured
- Return period: 475-500 years

Collapse Prevention (Maximum Credible Earthquake):
- Major structural damage
- Building on verge of collapse but doesn't collapse
- Life safety marginally ensured
- Return period: 2,500 years

For Sri Lanka's Low Seismicity:
- Focus on robustness and good detailing
- Modest seismic forces
- Ductility and capacity design principles

KEY CONCEPTS:

Ductility:
- Ability of structure to deform beyond elastic range without failure
- Achieved through proper detailing of reinforcement
- Confinement of concrete in critical regions
- Energy dissipation through inelastic deformation

Regularity:
- Regular building configuration (plan and elevation)
- Symmetry and uniform distribution of mass and stiffness
- Avoid torsional irregularities
- Irregular buildings require more rigorous analysis

Redundancy:
- Multiple load paths
- Avoid single point of failure
- Distributed resistance

Strong Column - Weak Beam:
- Columns should be stronger than beams at joints
- Ensures plastic hinges form in beams, not columns
- Prevents soft-story mechanism

Diaphragm Action:
- Floor slabs act as rigid diaphragms
- Transfer lateral loads to vertical resisting elements (shear walls, frames)

======================================================================
CHAPTER 3: SEISMIC DESIGN PROCEDURES FOR BUILDINGS
======================================================================

3.1 SEISMIC ACTIONS AND PARAMETERS

DEFINING SEISMIC ACTION FOR SRI LANKA:

Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA):
- Proposed for Sri Lanka: 0.05g to 0.10g
- Varies slightly by location (higher near potential fault zones)
- Conservative value: 0.10g for important structures

Seismic Zone Factor:
- If using IS code: Zone II (lowest zone), Z = 0.10

Response Spectrum:
- Defines earthquake ground motion for design
- Depends on PGA, soil type, and structural period
- Type 1 or Type 2 spectrum (Euro Code)
- For low seismicity: Type 1 with low PGA

Soil Classification:

Soil Types (Euro Code):
- Soil Class A: Rock or very stiff soil (Vs > 800 m/s)
- Soil Class B: Very dense sand/gravel or stiff clay (Vs 360-800 m/s)
- Soil Class C: Dense sand/gravel or firm clay (Vs 180-360 m/s)
- Soil Class D: Loose to medium sand/gravel or soft clay (Vs < 180 m/s)
- Soil Class E: Very soft soil (special analysis required)

Where Vs = shear wave velocity

Sri Lanka:
- Varies by location
- Coastal areas: Often Soil Class C or D
- Hill country with rock: Class A or B
- Site-specific geotechnical investigation recommended

Importance Factor:
- Accounts for building importance and occupancy
- Hospitals, fire stations, emergency facilities: γI = 1.2-1.4
- Normal buildings: γI = 1.0
- Agricultural or temporary: γI = 0.8

3.2 ANALYSIS METHODS

LEVEL OF ANALYSIS BASED ON BUILDING:

Simplified/Prescriptive Method:
- For low-rise regular buildings (up to 3-4 stories)
- Simple rules and detailing provisions
- No rigorous analysis required in very low seismicity areas

Equivalent Lateral Force Method:
- For regular buildings up to 40-50 m height
- Simplified static analysis
- Lateral forces applied at each floor level
- Suitable for most buildings in Sri Lanka

Modal Response Spectrum Analysis:
- For taller or irregular buildings
- Dynamic analysis considering multiple vibration modes
- More accurate than equivalent static method

Time-History Analysis:
- Most rigorous, for very important or complex buildings
- Uses acceleration time histories of earthquakes
- Nonlinear analysis possible
- Rarely required in Sri Lanka's low seismicity context

Recommended for Sri Lanka:
- Equivalent Lateral Force Method sufficient for most buildings
- Good detailing practices more important than rigorous analysis
- Modal analysis for tall buildings (> 15-20 stories) or irregular buildings

3.3 EQUIVALENT LATERAL FORCE METHOD

PROCEDURE:

Step 1: Determine Seismic Weight
- Dead load of structure
- Quasi-permanent live load (partial live load for long-term presence)
- W = Dead load + ψ × Live load (where ψ = 0.3-0.6 depending on occupancy)

Step 2: Calculate Fundamental Period
- T = 0.075 × H^0.75 (for concrete moment frames, approximate formula)
- T = 0.050 × H^0.75 (for concrete shear wall buildings)
- Where H = building height in meters
- More accurate methods available (Rayleigh method, software modeling)

Step 3: Determine Design Spectral Acceleration
- From response spectrum, obtain Sd(T) at the fundamental period T
- Sd(T) depends on PGA, soil type, and period

Step 4: Calculate Base Shear
- Vb = Sd(T) × W × λ
- Where λ = correction factor (usually 0.85 for buildings with 3+ stories)

Step 5: Distribute Base Shear Vertically
- Fi = Vb × (Wi × Hi) / Σ(Wj × Hj)
- Where Fi = lateral force at level i, Wi = seismic weight at level i,
  Hi = height of level i above base

Step 6: Apply Loads and Analyze Structure
- Apply lateral forces at each floor level
- Analyze using structural analysis software or manual methods
- Check member forces, drifts, stresses

Step 7: Design and Detail Members
- Reinforced concrete members with ductile detailing
- Capacity design principles
- Connections and joints

WORKED EXAMPLE FOR SRI LANKA CONTEXT:

Given:
- 10-story residential building in Colombo
- Height H = 30 m
- Seismic weight W = 1,500 tonnes (15,000 kN)
- Concrete moment frame structure
- Soil Class C

Parameters:
- PGA = 0.10g (conservative for Sri Lanka)
- Response spectrum for Soil C, PGA 0.10g
- Importance factor γI = 1.0 (normal occupancy)

Calculations:

Fundamental Period:
T = 0.075 × H^0.75 = 0.075 × (30)^0.75 = 0.075 × 13.16 = 0.99 seconds

Design Spectral Acceleration:
From response spectrum at T = 0.99 s, Sd(T) ≈ 0.05g = 0.49 m/s²

Base Shear:
Vb = Sd(T) × W × λ = 0.49 × 15,000 × 0.85 = 6,247 kN

Base Shear Coefficient:
Vb/W = 6,247/15,000 = 0.42, or 4.2% of building weight
(Quite modest due to low seismicity)

Force Distribution:
Distributed to each floor based on height and mass
(Detailed distribution omitted for brevity)

Conclusion:
Seismic forces are relatively low compared to high seismicity zones (where base
shear may be 10-20% of weight). Good detailing and structural integrity are
primary concerns.

3.4 DRIFT AND DEFORMATION LIMITS

INTER-STORY DRIFT:

Definition:
- Relative horizontal displacement between consecutive floors
- Expressed as drift ratio (drift/story height)

Limits:
- Damage limitation (serviceability): Drift ≤ 0.5-0.7% of story height
- Ultimate limit state: Drift ≤ 2.0-2.5% of story height

P-Delta Effects:
- Additional moments due to vertical loads acting on deformed structure
- Stability coefficient θ = (Σ P × Δ) / (V × h) < 0.10
- Where P = axial load, Δ = drift, V = story shear, h = story height
- If θ > 0.10, significant P-Delta effects, need special consideration

======================================================================
CHAPTER 4: DUCTILE DETAILING OF REINFORCED CONCRETE
======================================================================

4.1 IMPORTANCE OF DETAILING

IN LOW SEISMICITY AREAS:

Good Detailing More Important Than Analysis:
- Seismic forces are low (4-5% of weight in Sri Lanka vs. 15-20% in high seismicity)
- Achieving ductility and robustness through proper detailing is critical
- Poor detailing can lead to brittle failure even under low seismic loads

Ductile vs. Brittle Failure:
- Ductile: Large deformations, warning signs, gradual failure
- Brittle: Sudden failure without warning (concrete crushing, shear failure,
  bond failure)
- Detailing ensures ductile behavior

4.2 DUCTILE DETAILING FOR BEAMS

LONGITUDINAL REINFORCEMENT:

Minimum Reinforcement:
- Minimum As = 0.26 × (fctm/fyk) × b × d ≥ 0.0013 × b × d
- Where fctm = mean tensile strength of concrete, fyk = yield strength of steel,
  b = width, d = effective depth
- Ensures minimum flexural capacity

Maximum Reinforcement:
- Maximum reinforcement ratio ≤ 4% of gross cross-section
- Ensures ductility and adequate space for concrete placement

Top and Bottom Reinforcement:
- Continuous top and bottom bars
- At least 2 bars on each face
- Provides redundancy and capacity for moment reversal

Curtailment:
- Careful curtailment of bars
- Adequate anchorage length
- No abrupt cut-off at high moment regions

TRANSVERSE REINFORCEMENT (STIRRUPS):

Purpose:
- Shear resistance
- Confinement of concrete
- Lateral support to longitudinal bars (prevent buckling)

Stirrup Configuration:
- Closed stirrups (rectangular or circular hoops)
- 135° hooks at ends (seismic hooks)
- Overlapping alternate bars

Spacing:
- Critical regions (near columns): Closer spacing (d/4, 8 × diameter of longitudinal bar, 24 × diameter of stirrup, or 300 mm, whichever is smallest)
- Mid-span: Normal shear design spacing

Critical Regions:
- Length = 2 × beam depth from face of support
- Increased shear demand due to plastic hinge formation

4.3 DUCTILE DETAILING FOR COLUMNS

LONGITUDINAL REINFORCEMENT:

Reinforcement Ratio:
- Minimum 1% of gross cross-section
- Maximum 4% (6% at laps)
- Adequate to provide flexural capacity

Number of Bars:
- Minimum 4 bars in rectangular columns
- Minimum 6 bars in circular columns
- Uniform distribution around perimeter

Lap Splices:
- Avoid lap splices in critical regions (plastic hinge zones)
- If unavoidable, use increased lap length and confining reinforcement

TRANSVERSE REINFORCEMENT (TIES/HOOPS):

Confinement:
- Essential for ductility
- Prevents spalling of cover concrete
- Confines core concrete (increases strength and ductility)

Tie Configuration:
- Rectangular hoops with 135° hooks
- Overlapping hooks at alternate corners
- Intermediate cross-ties as needed (for large columns)

Spacing in Critical Regions:
- s ≤ min (b/3, 6 × dbl, 125 mm)
- Where b = minimum column dimension, dbl = diameter of longitudinal bar

Critical Region Length:
- Greater of (1.5 × column depth, 1/6 of clear column height, 600 mm)
- From face of beam or slab

Strong Column - Weak Beam Check:
- ΣMRc ≥ 1.3 × ΣMRb
- Sum of column moment capacities ≥ 1.3 times sum of beam moment capacities at joint
- Ensures plastic hinges form in beams, not columns

4.4 BEAM-COLUMN JOINTS

JOINT BEHAVIOR:

Critical Zone:
- Beam-column joints subject to high shear stresses
- Complex stress state
- Potential for joint shear failure (brittle)

Joint Shear Force:
- Due to moment reversal in beams
- Must be resisted by joint

JOINT REINFORCEMENT:

Transverse Reinforcement Through Joint:
- Continue column ties through joint (may relax spacing slightly if beam
  stirrups provide confinement)
- Minimum area of horizontal reinforcement

Anchorage of Beam Bars:
- Adequate anchorage into joint and beyond
- Straight anchorage or hooks (90° or 180°)
- Anchorage length calculated per code

4.5 SHEAR WALLS

DUCTILE SHEAR WALLS:

Purpose:
- Provide lateral resistance
- Stiffness to control drifts
- Common in medium to high-rise buildings

Reinforcement:
- Vertical and horizontal reinforcement (mesh)
- Minimum 0.25% in each direction (0.4% for high seismicity, less for Sri Lanka)

Boundary Elements:
- At edges of wall
- Heavily reinforced and confined
- Similar to column detailing
- Required if wall in compression zone under high stress

Coupling Beams:
- Connect shear walls
- Ductile detailing with diagonal reinforcement (where applicable)

CHAPTER 9: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
======================================================================

9.1 CURRENT PRACTICE IN SRI LANKA

ADOPTION OF SEISMIC DESIGN:

Voluntary and Limited:
- No mandatory seismic design for most buildings
- Important and critical structures increasingly include provisions voluntarily
- Government buildings, hospitals, tall buildings
- International projects (donor-funded) typically require seismic design

Inconsistency:
- Varied approaches among engineers
- Lack of uniform standards and parameters

Detailing Standards:
- "Earthquake Resistant Detailing for Buildings in Sri Lanka" (SSESL) provides
  basic guidance
- Not comprehensive, needs expansion

9.2 NEED FOR NATIONAL SEISMIC CODE

ARGUMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT:

Risk Mitigation:
- Even low probability events can have significant consequences
- Preparedness and resilience

Good Practice:
- Modern engineering includes seismic considerations even in low seismicity areas
- Ductile detailing improves structural performance for all loads (not just seismic)

International Standards:
- Alignment with global best practices
- Facilitates international collaboration

PROPOSED ACTIONS:

Develop National Seismic Code:
- Comprehensive guidelines adapted to Sri Lankan conditions
- Define seismic parameters (PGA, response spectra, etc.) for different regions
- Simplified provisions for common building types
- Mandatory for important structures

Training and Capacity Building:
- Education of engineers, designers, builders
- Continuing professional development

Public Awareness:
- Community education on earthquake safety
- Emergency preparedness

Research:
- Detailed seismic hazard studies
- Microzonation of urban areas
- Testing of local materials and construction systems

Enforcement:
- Incorporation into building regulations
- Inspection and compliance

9.3 ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL BODIES AND ACADEMIA

IESL, SSESL, UNIVERSITIES:

Contributions:
- Development of guidelines and standards
- Research and publications
- Training programs and seminars
- Advocacy for seismic safety

Collaboration:
- With government agencies (UDA, NBRO, RDA, etc.)
- International partnerships
