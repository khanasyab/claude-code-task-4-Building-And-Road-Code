INTRODUCTION OF EIA:

The National Environmental (Amendment) Act No. 56 of 1988 introduced Environmental

major regulatory functions to the Central Environmental Authority.

Purpose of EIA:
- Identify environmental impacts of proposed projects
- Assess significance of impacts
- Propose mitigation measures
- Enable informed decision-making
- Prevent environmental degradation
- Ensure sustainable development

Applicability:
All "prescribed" development projects are required to undergo EIA process prior
to implementation. Large-scale development projects likely to have significant
environmental impacts are listed as prescribed projects.

PRESCRIBED PROJECTS:

Gazette Notifications:
- Gazette No. 772/22 of June 24, 1993
- Gazette No. 859/14 of February 23, 1995
- Subsequent amendments and additions

Categories of Prescribed Projects:
1. Energy sector projects (power plants, transmission lines)
2. Industrial projects (cement, sugar, chemicals, textiles, distilleries)
3. Mining and mineral processing
4. Infrastructure (highways, railways, ports, airports)
5. Urban development (housing over 50 ha, commercial developments)
6. Tourism (hotels over 99 rooms)
7. Land reclamation (wetlands over 4 hectares, coastal areas)
8. Waste management (landfills, treatment plants)
9. Agriculture (plantations, irrigation)
10. Forestry (logging, forest conversion)

Threshold Criteria:
Projects are prescribed based on:
- Type of activity
- Size/scale of project
- Location (especially in environmentally sensitive areas)

ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS (ESAs):

Definition:
Areas with significant environmental value requiring special protection.

Types of ESAs:

Special Provision:
If "prescribed projects" are located wholly or partially within ESAs, they require
EIA irrespective of their magnitude.
