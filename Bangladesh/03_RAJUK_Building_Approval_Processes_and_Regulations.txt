======================================================================
CHAPTER 2: DETAILED AREA PLAN (DAP) 2022-2035
======================================================================

2.1 OVERVIEW OF DAP

The Detailed Area Plan (DAP) 2022-2035 for Dhaka is the primary
planning document that outlines:
- Land use zoning
- Building height restrictions
- Floor Area Ratio (FAR) regulations
- Infrastructure development plans
- Urban development strategies

The DAP covers the entire 1,528 sq km area under RAJUK's
jurisdiction and has been converted into urban residential zones/
residential areas by this comprehensive plan.

2.2 ZONING CATEGORIES

The DAP categorizes various Dhaka neighborhoods according to their
intended use:

RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
- Low-density residential
- Medium-density residential
- High-density residential
- Mixed residential

COMMERCIAL ZONES:
- Local commercial
- Central commercial
- Regional commercial
- Mixed-use commercial

INDUSTRIAL ZONES:
- Light industrial
- Medium industrial
- Heavy industrial
- IT and technology parks

INSTITUTIONAL ZONES:
- Educational institutions
- Healthcare facilities
- Government offices
- Religious institutions

SPECIAL ZONES:
- Agricultural preservation
- Water bodies
- Open spaces and parks
- Heritage areas
- Transport facilities

2.3 FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR) STANDARDS

The DAP establishes FAR standards across Dhaka:

Only 5 blocks out of 346 will receive the 5-6 FAR standards
10 blocks will receive 4-5 FAR standards
19 blocks will receive 3-4 FAR standards
Remaining blocks will receive 1-3 FAR standards

FAR DEFINITION:
Floor Area Ratio = Total Floor Area of Building / Plot Area

The FAR controls building density and determines how much
construction is permitted on a given plot.

2.4 BUILDING HEIGHT REGULATIONS

Height restrictions are established based on:
- Zone classification
- Plot location
- Airport flight path considerations
- Urban design considerations
- Infrastructure capacity

The plan defines specific height limits for each zone, controlling
building height through:
- Maximum number of floors
- Maximum height in meters
- FAR limitations
- Setback requirements

2.5 LAND USE CLEARANCE EXEMPTIONS

Planned residential areas of RAJUK like Gulshan, Banani, Uttara,
Dhanmondi and other private housing areas that already have RAJUK
approval as residential areas are not subject to land use clearance.

However, for other areas obtaining land use clearance is mandatory
before submitting plans for construction.
