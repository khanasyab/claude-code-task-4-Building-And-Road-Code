5. FAIL - Quotation marks misused for non-exact text
6. PASS - Paragraph numbering correct

CERTIFICATION STATUS: NOT CERTIFIED

This document cannot be certified as having exact and complete BNR 1994
base provisions until the critical issues are resolved.

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL (Must fix before any other work):

1. Provide authentic BNR 1994 source document
   - Current: Provided file ends at paragraph 1.139 (no Para 1.70)
   - Required: Complete BNR 1994 with Para 1.70

2. Resolve source version discrepancy
   - Current: Marked as "BNR 1994" but actually BNR 1989
   - Required: Clarify which version is the true base and correct reference

3. Fix quotation marks violation  
   - Current: Text marked "EXACT TEXT FROM BNR 1994" but is not exact
   - Required: Either restore exact text OR remove quotation marks

PRIORITY 2 - HIGH (After Priority 1):

4. Restore exact original text
   Option A: Make text character-by-character identical to original
   Option B: Remove "EXACT" designation and document alterations
   Current: 6 alterations must be eliminated or properly documented

5. Add transparency documentation
   If grammatical corrections are intentional improvements:
   - List each alteration with justification
   - Mark as "modernized version" or "corrected version"
   - Maintain clear separation from original

6. Verify related paragraphs
   Once source is available:
   - Verify Para 1.53, 1.57, 1.62, 1.87 for exactness
   - Check all cross-references for accuracy
