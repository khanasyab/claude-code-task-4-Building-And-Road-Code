FOREWORD
The resources for the development of roads
continue
to
be
limited
and
far
short
of the demmd because of the phenomenal
growth
of
traffic
on
our
roads.
Highway
Engineers are
thus
pressed to evolve the most
economical
design
and
construction
practices to match the specific
technical
requirements
compatible
with
the
overall
socio-economic
needs.
Though there have been
remarkable advancements in the use of equipment based technology
in the field of road construction, such technology may not
be
suit-
able for use in entirety in our country in view of the
large
surplus
manpower
available
with
us.
Hence,
there
is
need
for
going
in for intermediate technology which perhaps
is best
suited
to
our
country.
The Highway Engineers have
been
quite
conscious
of
this
requirement
and
keeping
this
in
view,
the
-'Guidelines on the
Choice and Planning of Appropriate Technology in Road Construc-
tion" have been evolved by the Indian
Roads Congress
through
a
Special
Committee.
These
guidelines
were
approved
by
the
Council
in
their 109th meeting held at Nagpur on the 8th January,
1984 for being issued as a Special Publication of the
Indian
Roads
Congress.
I hope that this publication will
prove
to
be
a
very
useful
guide
to
the Highway Engineers of our country.
We would, how-
ever, welcome feed back data from the field engineers
in
order
to
know their difficulties, if any, so that the same could be
given
due
consideration.

GUIDELINES ON THE CHOICE AND PLANNING OF
APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY IN ROAD
CONSTRUCTION
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The fundamental
principle
of
alignment,
design
and
construction
of
any
road
is
to achieve the least overall cost of
transportation having regard to the
cost
of
initial
construction
of
the
facility,
its
periodic maintenance and vehicle operation, while
at the same time satisfying the- social
and
environmental
require-
ments.
Once a road project has been prepared
on
this
principle,
the
prime objective of the Site Engineer
will
be
to
complete
the
construction to the stipulated requirements
at
the
minimum
cost,
and within the time schedule.
Fulfilment
of
this
objective
will
involve
several
steps
which
will
include, inter alia, the choice of
the
appropriate
construction
technology
which
is economically
viable and technically suitable for the type of w~rk
and
for
which
the necessary input resources are readily available or can be
made
available
in
time.
Once the construction method
is chosen, what-
ever method
it may be, the Site Engineer
should
arrange
for
the
needed resources in time and take all
measures
for
their
efficient
and economical working
1.2.
In the interest of better planning of works
at
site
and
economical execution of highway projects, this publication
provides
guidelines for the
choice
of
appropriate
construction
methods
under different situations, and discusses
the
ways
and
means
for
improving the efficiency and productivity of these methods. A large
number of worked out examples have been
included
for
assisting
the Site Engineers in this regard.
1.3.
These guidelines were initially prepared
by
K.
Aruna-
chalam,
Deputy
Secretary
(Research),
Indian Roads
Congress.
These were considered and approved
by
the
Special
Committee
for
Mechanised Road
Construction
in their meeting held at New
Delhi on the 2nd December,
1983.
These were later
approved by
the
Executive
Committee
by
circulation and then by the Council

in their meeting held at Nagpur on the 8th January, 1984 for
being
issued as a Snecial Publication of the Indian Roads Congress
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The choice of the appropriate
construction
method
for
a
work
or
task
is
governed
by
several factors such as terrain,
climate, available resources, technical feasibility for
the
nature
of
operations and relative economy.
While for some operations, there
can be more than one method that could be feasible and the choice
will mostly be dictated by the availability of the needed
resources,
for some other technical requirements or the
time
factor will
dic-
tate
the
adoption
of
only
one
type of method.
For example,
compaction of aggregates for WBM can be done only
by
a
power
roller even in cases where the aggregates are broken and hauled
to
site
of work
by
purely manual methods.
Similarly, even though
the manual methods might be the most economical
alternative
for
earthworks within short leads, equipment-intensive
methods
might
have
to
be
resorted
to
in cases where time of completion is the
crucial factor.
2.2.
This
document
gives
guidelines
for
helping
the
Site
Engineer in choosing the appropriate methods for the various
tasks
involved in roacl construction
under
different
situations
and
dis-
cusses
the
ways
and
means
of improving
the
efficiency
and
productivity of these methods.
It should be understood that
these
guidelines are neither absolute nor static and
would need
changes
from
time
to
time
depending
on
the relative cost of materials,
equipment and services involved.
It
is,
therefore,
suggested
that
road construction departments should collect, compile and
analyse
the
productivity
data along with the governing parameters at least
for major road construction projects so
that
the
guidelines
could
be up-dated in the years to come.
2.3.
The construction methods are
generally
classified
into
three categories, namely
:
(i)
Labour-intensive methods which depend mostly on unskilled
labour
who may use nothing more than simple hand tools.
(ii)
Intermediate methods which employ
certain
simple
equipment
or
non-human resources for aiding the manual operations, such as pack
of animals, wheeled carts, small mixing machines, etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 76
======================================================================
3
(iii) Equipment— intensive methods in which the operations are
executed
by
a
single
or series of machines and where no unskilled labour is
employed except in purely ancillary capacity.
Thus
for
any
task,
a
broad spectrum
of methods
is
available
with the labour-intensive and equipment-intensive methods
falling
at
either extreme and the intermediate methods falling in-between
In actual practice, however, for certain ranges of
site
parameters,
it
will
be
inevitable
even for the labour-intensive'methods to use
some simple equipment or devices.
For example,
haulage
for
a
distance
of
over
100 m
for which pack animals, cart and the like
will necessarily have to be inducted though use of unskilled
labour
will
be
predominant.
Such
cases
almost
merge
with
the inter-
mediate
methods
because
of
physical
inevitability.
From
this
consideration, as also to avoid any
confusion
in
the
classification
of
the
different
methods,
both the labour-intensive and the inter-
mediate methods which are
practiced
extensively
in
the
country
will
be
dealt
with
together
in
these guidelines under the broad
heading 'Labour-based methods'.
3.
SITE PLANNING
Site planning forms the
forerunner
to
the
starting
of
any
construction
operation.
It
is
at
this
stage
that the site engineer
decides
on
the
appropriate
construction
method for the various
tasks to be accomplished,
plans
the
needed
resources
and
takes
measures
for
improving
the
productivity at task/activity level for
economical working.
All
this involves
a
step
by
step
procedure
which will include the following
:
(i)
Listing out
all
the
required
tasks
along with
the
quantities
split
according
to
critical
site
parameters
(e. g. hardness
of soil to be
excavated,
haulage distance,
etc.)
and
the
possible construction
methods.
A typical list is shown in Table
1 for illustration.
(ii)
Selecting the most appropriate method
of working
for
each
task
from
angles
of
technical
feasibility, economic viability and social
desirability.
This will require a good
understanding
and
relevant
information
relating
to
the
specification
requirements
and
the
capabilities
of
the different methods in achieving these, the produc-
tivity and cost of operation with these, the advantage and
disadvan-
tage
of
adopting
a method peculiar to a particular site, etc.
This
exercise will involve the listing out of all the
possible
methods,
and
choosing the most approriate one through a process of
rational and

systematic

This
aspect
is dealt with in more detail in
para 4.
(iii)
Calculations for the quantity of resource inputs for each
task
based
on
productivity
norms
for
the chosen method and the laid-down
time schedule,
(iv)
Preparation of a draft work plan showing the
calendar
of
activities
along with
the required resources.
This plan
is examined in light of
the resource s which are readily
available
or
which
can
he
made
available.
If the resources are sufficient or more than
sufficient
for
the
target
production,
the work plan can be finalised accordingly.
If otherwise,
t ie
Site
Engineer
should
explore
the
feasibility
of
improving
th»:
productivity
through management
measures, or by
extending the working: season, or by introducing an additional
shift.
If these are of no avail, he should inform his Senior Officers
of
the
position
and
demand
more
resources
or
extension
of
the time
schedule.
4.
CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CHOICE OF THE
APPROPRIATE CONSTRUCTION METHOD
4.1.
General
In
broad
terms,
the
choice
of
appropriate
construction
method should be based on the following considerations
:
(i)
Technical feasibility
(ii) Economic viability
(iii)
Social desirability
(iv)
Compatibility in working
This
would
show
that
the
choice
of
the
appropriate
construc-
tion
method
should
be
based
not on a single consideration or in
isolation but in the light of a
combination
of
factors.
Also,
the
governing
factors
will
not have the same importance for each arid
every task.
A
realistic
approach
in
this
regard
would
be
to
identify in the
first instance all the technically feasible methods
for
each
major
task
without
regard
to cost of construction and then
choose the
most
appropriate
method
through
a
framework
of
rational and systematic elimination.
For this purpose,
it would be
useful to make a listing of the type shown in Table
1.
The step by
step procedure
for
elimination
of
the
inappropriate
methods
as
illustrated
in
Table 2
can
then
be
followed
for
choosing
the
optimum method.

cost
for each

the project into account.
4.2.
Technical Feasibility
Many of the
tasks
involved
in
road
construction
can
be
executed
either by labour or equipment-intensive methods.
How-
ever,
there
are
some others vvhich can be accomplished by either
of these
methods
alone
with
no
other
alternative.
This
situa-
tion may arise because of the following factors
:
(i)
Specification requirements—for example, high-type asphaltic concrete
which
has
to
be
mixed, laid and compacted io a specified quality
source
choice of method



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 76
======================================================================
8
and within a stringent temperature
range
will
call
for
equipment
intensive
methods.
Another example
is subgrade compaction and
compaction
of pavement
courses which
can
be
effected
to
the
specified degree only with power rollers even where
labour-intensive
methods are adopted for other tasks.
(ii)
Physical constraints of energy of worker—production of aggregates by
manual
breaking is
possible,
but when the required sizes are small,
say less than 25 mm, and the rock is bard as
is
warranted
for
bit-
uminous surfacings, effort required will be too considerable
for
the
human
energy
to
cope
with, particularly when the aggregates are
required in large quantities.
Employment
of mechanical
crushers
will be inevitable in such cases.
(iii)
Size of work— at some works because
of
sheer
size,
such
as
high
embankments
in
long lengths for major highways, or mass produc-
tion of aggregates, or those which have to
be
completed
within
a
tight
time
schedule,
there will be no alternative but to adopt equip-
ment-intensive methods.
The
labour-intensive
alternative
would
entail the deployment of a very large labour force
in a
concentrated
way and even if such labour could be mobilised,
it would
be
physi-
cally impossible to have a good control either over
the
productivity
or quality.
(iv)
Restricted site conditions— large but concentrated works will not have
sufficient
space
for
working
of a large labour force, and for such
cases, labour methods may have to be ruled out.
On the other hand
at
certain
restricted
locations,
machines
cannot
operate
or
manoeuvre and labour methods will be the only alternative.
4.3.
Economic Viability
4.3
1.
Economic viability
is an important factor in the choice
among
technically
feasible
construction
methods.
The
exercise
involves
the
comparison
of costs by the various possible methods
and choosing the least cost alternative. The viability of any method
will depend on
its productivity and
the
relative
prices
of
labour
and/equipment.
One
method
of comparing the relative economy
of equipment-intensive method
vis-a-vis
a
labour-intensive
alter-
native
for
the
same
task
is
through
the concept of break even
wages for unskilled labour.
This
is done by calculating the cost
of
the taskby assuming different wage rates for labour and comparing
the same with that by the equipment-intensive
alternative.
Break-
even wage rate
is that wage at which the cost of carrying out a
task
by
labour
is
equal
to the cost by equipment.
A labour method
will be economical when the actual labour
rate
is
less
than
the
break-even wage rate.



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 76
======================================================================

4.3.2.
The basic data required for
cost
comparison
is
the
productivity
by
the
different
methods
for
various
tasks.
The
detailed World Bank Study* conducted in the country during early
seventies
had
shown
that
labour productivity can vary in a large
range, depending on parameters such as method of payment (daily-
paid, taskwork or piecework), and the
quality
of
supervision
and
site organisation.
For example, the productivity on an
earthwork
job
was
3-4
times when the incentive piecework payment method
was adopted compared to daily-paid wage method.
This
is not
to
say that the piecework method will be cheaper by 3-4 times since the
pieceworker will be earning almost two
times
that of a
daily-paid
labourer.
Better
site supervision will also involve some additional
cost.
4.3.3.
The studies have also shown that besides the incentive
wage system, further improvement
in
the
productivity
could
be
achieved
through
improved
tools,
project
organization and site
management.
Examples in this regard
are
avoidance
of
double
handling, balancing of tools and labour gangs, and taking measures
for reducing human effort like pre-ripping and
pre-wetting
of hard
soil prior to excavation.
4.4.
Social Desirability
In
a
developing
country
like
India,
provision
of
gainful
employment
to
a
large number of people
is an important matter
of social desirability which cannot be overlooked in road
construc-
tion which
is known to be capable of engaging
large
labour
force.
For
this
reason,
it is a commom practice in the economic analysis
of development projects in the country to shadow price the
cost
of
unskilled
labour
to
the
extent
of 50 per cent.
This
feature, if
taken into account in the
choice
of
the
method,
will
show
the
Summary of the Study and its findings may be seen in the following two Papers
published
by
the
Indian Roads Congress in November, 1976.
The First Paper
also lists out the Reports and Technical Memoranda of the World
Bank
where
more details of the various aspects of the Study can be found.

Compatibility in Working
The tasks involved in road construction can be
accomplished
adopting a wide range of methods from the
most
labour-intensive
to the most
equipment intensive,
but the
method chosen for one
task may dictate the
use
of similar
technology
for some
or all
other tasks in the project.
For example, loading of a large
capa-
city dump truck
should
be by mechanical loaders, as resorting to
labour loading, even if less costly for this activity,
will
entail idle
time for the expensive dump truck and consequently
result
in
an
overall uneconomic operation'.
4.6.
Overall
Philosophy
in
the
Choice
of
Appropriate
Technology
4.6.1.
Paras 4.1. through
4.5. have
broadly
discussed the
factors that should be considered in the choice of
the
most appro-
priate
method(s)
for
road
construction
projects.
Of
these,
economic viability among the technically feasible methods emerges as
the most important parameter. An objective exercise for evaluating
this parameter
will
require
realistic
productivity norms
of the
various
methods
under
different
site
conditions.
Productivity
norms adopted by the different
State P.W.Ds
in the
country for
working out the schedule of rates vary considerably
from
place to
place and cannot therefore be generalised.
4.6.2.
Factual
productivity
data
qualified
by
site
and
management parameters for road projects
in the
country
are not
available except in
the case
of labour
methods observed
in the
World
Bank
Study.
The
picture
of
relative
economy
of the
various methods (both
labour-intensive
and
equipment-intensive)
for the earthwork operation as emerging from
the Study
is
shown
in Fig.
1.
While the data for
the
labour
methods were
actually
measured, those for equipment-intensive
methods*" where
derived
fro.mjhe ideal productivity norms given in manufacturers' manuals.
The
equipment
costs were
at
' 1976
prices
and
the wages
for
unskilled labour were
taken to be
Rs 4.5
for
daily-paid
i worker
and Rs 9 for pieceworker.

are
given in
Table
3.
Till
more
realistic
indigenous
data are
available,
these
can be
consulted
to get a
broad idea
on the
economically feasible methods.
4.6.3.
Besides
knowledge
about
the
most
economical
method, the Site Engineer
will
be interested
in
working
out the
needed resources
for the
various
tasks
For this
purpose,
the
productivity information relating to certain important tasks abstrac-
ted from the World Bank Study are given in Tables 4 through 9.
4.6.4.
It may be noted that productivity of both
labour and
equipment
is strongly
influenced
by various
conditions
or para-
meters.
For example, in the case of earth
excavation
by labour,
the productivity will depend on age,
sex, traditional
skill,
health
and nutritional standards of labour; the terrain and
climatic condi-
tions; the hardness
of
soil; the
payment
method;
the
type
of
management and
supervision,
etc.
Similarly,
for
working with
machines, the specific
parameters
affecting
productivity
are the
age and standard of maintenance of the
equipment, the
operator
efficiency and the job efficiency.
In view of the interplay of several
parameters and the large variations in
the
productivity
from site
io
site-,
it will
be
convenient to
express the
productivity in
the
foi m of two enveloping lines, the upper one
(line A)
representing
the most favourable
conditions
(i.e. high
incentive wages,
good
supervision, etc.) and the lower one (line B) denoting
poor
condi-
tions
(i.e. daily wages,
poor
supervi>ion,
etc.).
In Tables 4 to 9
relating to labour-based methods,
the input
coefficients which are
inverse of productivity are given for both line A and line B
condi-
tions.
On similar considerations,
productivity
of
equipment can
also be expressed in terms
of lines A and
B as discussed in para
6.4.
4.6.5.
The selection of
the most appropriate method for the
different
road construction
tasks
is
not
just
sufficient,
and
for
efficient and economical
completion
of a
road
project
the Site
Engineer will have to look for improvements in planning and
orga-
nization of the works.
Guidelines in this regard are given in para 5
lor labour based methods
and in
para 6 for
equipment-intensive
methods.

GUIDELINES ON PLANNING AND ORGANISATION OF
LABOUR-BASED METHODS
5.1.
General
A large number of resources will be required for
executing a
road project.
The Site Engineer
should
arrange
for these in the
required
quantities
and
in time
so
that
the
work
could
be
completed within
the
time
schedule.
The major
resources
for
labour based construction methods are
:
(i) Labour
(ii) Earth for earthwork
(iii) Aggregates and other pavement construction materials.
Besides these, tools and small equipment for the
different
opera-
tions and water will be required, and these are discussed alongwith
the above
resources
as
relevant.
Provision
of
cross-drainage
structures are not dealt with in this publication.
5.2.
Labour
5.2.1.
The number of labourers required for
a task
is given
by:
Volume of task
Number of labourers = Labour effective days x Productivity
Where productivity
is measured
in terms
of output
per day
per person.



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 76
======================================================================
18
5.2.2.
The labour effecuve days are affected by a number of
factors such as
:
(i) Length of construction season
(ii) Weekly or periodical rest days and other holidays
(iii)
. Absenteeism because of illness or local crop planting/harvesting
(iv) Tims lost in recruiting laoour at start of the season
(v) Tims lost due to bad weather during the working season
tvi) Time lost due to labour unrest.
While items
(i) to (iv) can be estimated to
a
reasonable
degree of
accuracy based on
local
experience, some ad hoc
allowance will
have to be provided for the other two items.
5.2.3.
Ideally, a constant
number
of
labour should
work
together in perfect balance
to
maximise
utilisation of
resources.
This, however,
is not generally possible in actual
practice
as there
will be buiid-up of labour at the
start
of
a job and
a run-down
towards the end.
Taking all these
into
account, an
example for
working out the effective labour
days for a typical
road project is
illustrated
in
Table
10.
Once
this
is
calculated,
the
average
number of labour to be
employed in a
task can be
computed by
the formula given in para 5.2.1.
In cases, where a work is required
to be speeded up or where additional work volumes
not
originally
anticipated crop up, the labour resources
should be
augmented in
the non-agricultural periods where
labour can be
mobilised with
greater ease.
5.2.4.
In harvest and other periods
specific
to the
area, a
heavy run-down of labour availability will be a general feature. On
works where equipment like trucks, etc. are used alongwith labour,
any idling of the equipment during such periods
would add
to the
cost of
the project.
One
. way
to
avoid
this
is
to
take
away
available labour from the tasks being carried out by
labour
alone
and put them to work
with the
equipment for
ensuring their full
utilisation.
Alternatively,
import
of
labour
from
outside
by
paying-higher wages could be considered.
However,
the measure
adopted should be based
on
the relative
costs of
paying higher
wages or of having the equipment standing idle.

Site Clearance
5.3
1.
Site clearance
which
forms
the first
stage of
any
construction
activity
may
consist
of removing
and
disposing/
storing/stacking of one or more of the following
:
(i) Trees, bushes and shrubs
(ii) Grass and other vegetation
(iii) Stumps, rubbish, loose stones, etc.
(iv) Top soil from embankment, cut
and borrow
areas
(removed
and
stored for re-application)



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 76
======================================================================
20
Site clearance should proc ed
well ahead of
construction so
that the construction lines can be set out and the precise nature
of
the ground can be known for planning the earthwork operations.
It
will
be
a good practice to carry out all major clearance work and
to set out alignments, etc. for a whole season's work before
const-
ruction begins.
5.3.2.
The
project
drawings
would
generally
show
the
clearing limits.
If not,
the
limits
should
extend over
the area
which in one way or the other affect the construction activities.
In
either case, the
following
guidelines may
be helpful
during the
operations
:
(i)
All trees and stumps
falling
within
the
excavation/fill
toe
lines
should be cut to such depths that these do not
fall within
0.5 m of
the subgrade level.
(ii) In all other cases, the vegetation
which
protects
the
ground
soil
against erosion
should
not
be* cut
out
unless their
removal
is
warranted either for facilitating construction operations,
or for haul
roads, or for improving the visibility, etc.
In such cases,
the
tiees
etc. should be removed only upto the ground level leaving the
roots
to remain in place.
(iii) Removal of top
soil
should be
to
the
depth
containing
organic
. matter, and this may generally be to the depth of 50— 150 mm.
5.3.3.
Labour methods are
well
suited
for site
clearance
work.
Labour can distinguish between the trees
and plants
to be
removed and to be left in place, and the
actual
depth of
organic
top soil to
be
cleared.
They
should
be
provided
with
good
quality axes, saws and
grubbing
mattocks,
portable tree
pulling
devices like winches,
etc
Animals
or
tractors can
be used for
removing the felled trees to the stackyard.
5.4.
Earthwork
5.4.1.
General
(1)
Earthwork constitutes a major component
in the
cost of
any road project, and on the overall basis,
the
cost
of
earthwork
may amount to 25—30 per cent
of the
project
cost.
For
lower
category roads,
th'is percentage will be even more. Careful planning
and efficient
operation
of
the
involved
activities
is
therefore
necessary for economising road construction cost.



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 76
======================================================================
21
(2)
Earthwork can be broken
down
into
the
activities of
ripping (if required),
excavation,
loading of
excavated
material
into the haulage
mechanism,
hauling,
unloading,
spreading and
compaction, although
more
than one
of
these activities
can be
combined into a
single
operation
All these
operations
can be
economically performed by
labour-based methods
which include
use of some simple equipment like tractor-trailer,
flat-bed
trucks,
etc.
->
5.4.2.
Excavation
(1)
Excavation in road construction may
be
for cutting the
natural ground for roadway or drain
construction,
or
for
winning
earth from borrow areas for embankments, or for founding highway
structures.
In all cases
if excavation can be
combined with load-
ing, the combined operation becomes
more efficient. However,
in
hard materials like moorum. soft rock, etc. excavation and
loading
generally will have to be done separately in labour based methods.
(2)
The hardness of the material excavated
is an
important
factor affecting productivity of
excavation tasks.
The
Minisiry of
Transport Specification
divides
soil
into two
categories, namely,
ordinary soil and hard
soil with the following description
:
(a)
Ordinary Soil
This shall comprise vegetable or organic soil,
turf, sand,
silt, loam,
clay, mud, peat, black cotton
soil,
soft shale or
loose
moorum, a
mixture of these and similar material which
yields
to the
ordinary
application of
pick
and
shovel, rake
or other
ordinary
digging
implement.
Removal
of
gravel
or
any other
nodular
material
having diameter in any one direction not exceeding 75 mm occurring
in such strata shall be deemed to be covered under this category.
(b)
Hard Soil
This shall include
:
(i)
stiff heavy clay,
hard
shale,
or
compact moorum
requiring
grafting tool or pick or both and shovel, closely applied;
(ii) gravel and cobble stone having maximum diameter in
any
one
direction between 75 and 300 mm;
(iii) soling of roads, paths, etc., and hard core;
(iv) macadam surfaces such as water bound, and bitumen/tar bound;
(v) lime concrete, stone masonry in lime mortar and
brick-work in
lime/cement mortar below ground level;
(vi)
soft conglomerate, where the stones may be detached
from
the
matrix with picks; and



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 76
======================================================================
22
(vii) generally any material which requires
the
close
application of
picks, or scarifiers
to
loosen
and not
affording resistance
to
digging greater than the hardest of any soil mentioned
in
(i) to
(vi) above.
Available data show
that
hard
soils
require 2-3
times the
manpower inputs compared to that for softer soils.
Effort required
for hard soils can be reduced and the productivity increased to the
extent of 50-100 per cent by
:
(i) Pre-ripping, and
(ii) Wetting
(3)
Pre-ripping may
be
by
tractor/animal
drawn
ploughs.
Ripping
is
started
on
a
narrow
strip
which
after the process is
excavated and the material removed to form
working
space
with
vertical
faces.
The
adjoining
strip
is then ripped and the excava-
tion
is continued on
the
vertical
faces
which
has
the
advantage
that
the
cut
material
falls
away from the face aided by gravity.
Also, the vertical face reduces drying cut and hardening of
soil
in
hot climates.
(4)
Wetting
prior
to
excavation
softens
the
material
and
makes
the
excavation task easier.
However, over-wetting of clay
soils should be guarded against
as
this may
make
the
materials
slushy
and
un-workable.
It
will
be
advantageous
to
time
the
earthwork operation when the soil
is fairly moist so
that
not
only
the excavation effort is less but also not much water will be required
to be added for
compaction.
The
best
time
for
the
purpose
is
at
the
beginning
of
construction
season,
i.e.
soon
after
the
monsoons when every
opportunity
should
be
taken
to
plan
the
bulk of the earthwork.
(5)
The higher the material has to be
lifted for
loading,
the
greater
will
be
the
amount
of
effort expended, see Table 4.
A
low
or
negative
loading
height
will
make
the
operation
much
easier.
The
excavation
should
be
so
organised
that
as
far
as
possible, all haulage containers can
be
loaded
within
small
lifts,
if
negative
lifts
are
not
possible.
For.
this
purpose,
a strip
of
width sufficient to pass the haulage vehicle
is first
cut.
Excavation
is
proceeded
with
on the vertical faces so that the haulage system
can be loaded-without much
lift.
Fig. 2,
illustrates
the
sequence
of short-haul earthwork by headbasket method while Fig.
3, shows
possible arrangements for medium hauls using carts/vehicles.

5.4.3.
Hauling
(1)
A
variety of labour based methods are possible for haul-
ing soil for earthwork.
In general, the choice of
the
method
and
the cost of hauling are governed by
:
(i) Haulage distance
(ii)
Rise/fall from the source to place of deposition
(iii) Conditions
of
the
haulage
routes
such
as
roughness,
firmness, uniformity, slope, etc.
(2)
For
embankment
construction,
the
soil
is
generally
obtained either from ioadway and drainage
excavation
or
borrow
areas,
or
from
both.
At ;he stage of designing the grade line for
the road,
it will be expected
that
the
cut
and
fill
quantities
are
balanced
to
the maximum
extent possible.
Balancing is possible
both in the lateral and longitudinal directions as depicted in Fig.
4.
Lateral
balancing
involves
a
half-cut,
half-fill
cross section with
or without retaining wall, but this
will
not
be
feasible when
the
ground
slope
is
very
steep
in
which
case
the road may have to
be
in
full
cutting.
Lateral
balancing,
where
possible
will
not
involve
much
haulage,
but
in longitudinal balancing, the distance
may vary from case to case.
When the haulage
distance
is
more
than
150-200
m,
it
will be more economical to go in for roadside
borrow
if available,
(3)
Winning earth from roadside borrow areas which involves
short haulage distances
is ideally suited for manual
methods.
The
borrow
pits
should
preferably
be
located
on
both
sides of the
line of work.
Guidance
on
the location
of
roadside
borrowpits
can be
had from IRC
: 10 "Recommended Practice for Borrowpits
for
Road
Embankments
Constructed
by
Manual
Operation".
Roadside
borrowpits
may,
however,
be
not
possible in the case
of high embankments involving large earthwork
quantities
and
in
certain other cases, for example, sections falling on low lying areas.
(4)
The volume occupied by soil in compacted
fill will usually
differ
from
in-situ
volume
in
borrow areas because of difference
in densities.
The correction factor
for
converting
in-situ
volume
into compacted volume
is given by
:

LONGITUDINALLY
BALANCED CUT— FILL
Fig. 4.
Balancing of cut and
fill in road construction
Where vehicles are used for haulage, the output will be
a
function
of
loose
volume carried by the vehicle and therefore a knowledge
of the loose density of bulking factor of the soil
will
be
required.
Bulking factor
is given by
:
Bulking factor

Loose density in haulage



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 76
======================================================================
26
The loose dry density of most of the soils will
be
in
the
range
of
1.4 and
1.5 tonnes/m 3
.
(5)
Rise or
lift from source to
place
of
deposition
involves
additional
effort,
and
roughly
1
metre rise can be taken as equi-
valent to 10 m
haulage
distance.
Similarly, a
rough
haul
route
involves
additional
effort,
but
the
extent
varies from method to
method.
The different methods, therefore, require different
treat-
ment
to
the
haulage
routes.
While men
and pack animals can
negotiate
rough
routes
with
steeper
gradients,
wheel
barrow,
animal
cart
and
other
similar devices are highly sensitive to these
parameters.
This
aspect
is
discussed
in
subsequent
paragraphs
under respective method of hauling.
Head Baskets
(6)
Head baskets are one of the most common form
of man-
power
haulage
and
are efficient for distances upto 50-60 m.
It is
reasonably independent of
the
route
condition.
Unloading
is
a
simple
operation
and
little
spreading
is needed
after unloading.
Load carried varies between 15 and 40 kg and
speeds
from
50
to
70 m/minute.
Use sjiould be made of spare baskets for excavators
to
fill the basket by the time the hauler returns.
Wheel Barrows
(7)
Wheel barrows can be used for haulage between
25
and
100
m,
and
can
be
highly economical
if a smooth and firm haul
route can be made.
The
most common
method
is
by
building
a barrow
way usually made of planks
if a hard and smooth surface
cannot
be
formed
on
the
ground.
Barrow
has
a
triangular
body with a single wheel fitted in the forward part.
With improved
barrows fitted wiih pneumatic
tyres,
pay
loads
in
the
range
of
70-120 kg are possible at speeds 50-80 m/minute.
Pack Animals
(8)
A variety of animals
like
donkeys,
mules,
ponies
and
camels
can
be
used
for
pack
work.
Haulage
by pack animals
becomes relatively advantageous where
steep
gradients
and
poor
haul
routes
are
encountered.
The
load
usually
of the order of
100-200 kg,
is carried on panniers made
of
w'oven
rope.
Loading
is
by
hoe
or shovel and emptying
is by tipping.
This method can



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 76
======================================================================
Ti
be found workable for distance upto 300 m
and
rise
upto
about
10
m.
Usually
gangs
of
10-
1 2
animals
are
loaded,
led
and
unloaded 4-5 labourers.
Animal Carts
(9)
Wooden-wheeled or
pneumatic
tyred
carts
pulled
by
bullock
or
buffalo
can
be
used
for
haul
distance
upto 100 m.
While large
diameter
solid-wheeled
carts
can
negotiate
uneven
or
slushy
tracks,
pneumatic
tyred
carts
can
work only on firm
and even ground.
The load carried per
trip
varies
between
500
and
1000
kg.
Haul
speeds vary from 48-60 m/min depending on
haul route condition.
Loading
is by headbaskets
while
unloading
is by tipping the cart (after unyoking the animals) and using a hoe.
Tractor-trailer and Flat-bed Truck
(10)
Manual and animal haulage methods usually are
uneco-
nomical
on
hauls
of
over
500
m.
The
most common form of
equipment for longer hauls in combination with
manual loading
is
either the tractor-trailer combination or the flat-bed truck.
(11)
Tractors are easily available during slack
times
in
the
farmwork
cycle.
They
have
the
advantage of being a basic and
robust machine
and
are
more
likely
to
have
a
well
developed
repair
facility.
Two
or
more
trailers may be used depending on
haul-length so that when one
is being
hauled,
the
other may
be
loaded.
The labour for a tractor may be divided into three groups,
two at the
borrow
area
(one
for
excavation
and
the
other
for
loading)
and
the
third
at the
fill site for unloading and spreading.
The suggested load capacity of trailers are
:

45
„

„
60
„

„

„
6
,,
(12)
Two-axle trailers are capable of carrying a greater load"
than
a
single
axle
trailer of the same size and are easier to hitch
and
unhitch.
Single
axle
trailer
is much
easier
to
manoeuvre
and
can
transfer
load
to
the
back
axle
of
the tractor thereby



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 76
======================================================================
2S
greatly increasing the
traction
which
may
be
required
for
haul
on poor routes or steep ramps.
(13)
The lower
the loading
height,
the
quicker
the
trailer
may
be
loaded.
The
lie
of
the land can be utilised to ensure a
downhill approach
for
the
loaders,
or
loading
benches
can
be
excavated.
Separate
team
of
unloaders
should
be
provided at
the unloading point.
If tipping
trailers
are
used,
unloaders
will
not
be
needed
but
the
cost of the equipment wili be high.
The
nature of the haul route has an important effect on the
productivity
as rough
or
rutted route will cut the travel speed and up gradients
will reduce the pay
load.
Ideally
the
route
should
not
have
a
gradient steeper than 10 per cent and should be well maintained.
(14)
For flat-bed
trucks,
the
economical
haulage
distance
varies
between
1
and
5 km.
The haul route should be good and
the loading and unloading operations should be quick.
The
labour
gang may
be
divided
into
three
groups,
one at the borrow area
(for
excavation
when
the
truck
is
hauling
and
for
assisting
in
loading when the truck returns) the second moving with
the
truck
for loading and unloading, and the third at
fill site for spreading.
5.4.4.
Gang
balance
:
Gang
balance
is
the
distribution
of
activities
within
a
task
so that all the men in a gang can work
at much the same pace
In
planning,
the
resources,
this
aspect
must
be
considered
in
any
task
which
consists
of
a number of
inter-related
activities.
If
the
excavation-load-haul-unload
task
is
considered,
the
excavators and loaders should be able to work
at an even pace without
having
to
wait
for
a
hauler,

sizeable
portion
of the aggregate cost at the work site.
Arranging
for gravity loading from a higher level at quarry site,
cutting down
the
idle
time
of haulage vehicle by providing adequate number of
labourers for loading-unloading, maintaining the haul route in good
condition and
unloading
the material at the pre-planned locations
at work site to avoid double
handling
are
some
of
the
measures
for
improving
productivity
and
reducing
cost.
Flat-bed
trucks
are
extensively
used
in the country for aggregate haulage through
animal carts are also employed for shorter
hauls
and
where
only
small quantities are required.
5.5.2.
Stone
quarries
:
Generally,
stone
aggregates
for
road
works
are
supplied
from
well established running quarries.
Side by side, developmental work in identifying new quarry sources
is
al.so
going
on, and
it will be worthwhile considering opening up
of new quarries for greater economy
particularly
in
:hc
case
of
major civil
engineering works where the demands will be large and
continuous.
The first step in the process
will
be
to
test
sample
r
of rock from the prospective quarries
for
conformity
with
sped-



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 76

31
ficatjon
requirements.
If the material
is suitable, the main factors
to be taken into account
in choosing the best alternative would be
:
(i) Cost of removal of overburden and opening up the quarry.
(ii) Ease of excavation through blasting or other means.
(iii) Existance of suitable areas for installing the crushers, the cost thereof
and
the
distance
of
the
quarry
point
to
the
crusher
or
vehicle
loading point.
(iv) Cost of providing vehicle manoeuvring
area
in
the
quarry
and
of
access routes.
(v) Haul length, haul route condition and rise/fall of haul route.
(vi) The quantity of stones required to be extracted to assess the economy
of. opening up the quarry, providing access roads, etc.
Generally, the
initial cort of opening
a
quarry,
constructing
haul
roads,
installation
of crushing equipment, etc.
will be consi-
derable and outweigh the
operating
cost
unless
the
quantifies
to
be extracted are large,
and
the
quarry
could
be
put
to
use
in
future for other works.
The pioductiviiy of road aggregates by hand breaking depends
to a great extent on the hardness of stone and the reduction
factor.
Normally 200-250 mm sized rubble are collected after blasting and
used
for hand breaking with a 0.5-0.9 kg hand hammer.
The pro-
ductivity of breaking to 25-50 mm size
aggregate
used
for
Water
Bound Macadam
(i.e.
a reduction ratio of about 4) will be of the
order of 0.5 to
1.0 cu. m./man
day.
For
higher
reduction
ratio,
the
effort
required
will
be
higher,
and
the productivity will be
correspondingly less.
The effort required for breaking into smaller
sizes goes up steeply, and
it will be more economical
to
go
in
for
mechanical crushing for such cases.
5.5.3.
Moorum
and gravel quarries
:
As in the case of stone
quarries, the suitability of the available material
will
be
the
first
consideiation in the choice of moorum/gravel quarries.
Generally,
the installation cost for such quarries will only be nominal, and
for
choice among the suitable alternatives, the most significant factor will
be
the
haulage
cost.
The
factors
affecting haulage productivity
and cost such as loading height and time, haul
distance,
condition
of the haul route, etc. equally apply to this case.

5.6.
Compaction
5.6.1.
For
the
embankments,
compaction
is
generally
specified in terms of standard Proctor densir
- 95 per cent for body
of
embankment
and
100
per
cent
for
subgrade
portion and
shoulders.
The compaction
is to be done
in
250 mm
thick
loose
layers.
This
will
be
possibie
only
with
power
rollers
which
is
capital intensive.
Different types of soils require different types
of
rollers, but the 8/10 tonne three-wheeled roller will be found to be
useful
for
most
cases.
Where
a
power
roller
is used for com-
paction,
it should
be
ensured
that
the
hauling
and
spreading
activities
are
balanced
to
provide adequate work to the roller so
that
it does not remain idle.
Light-weight (0.5 — 2 tonne)
tractor/
animal
drawn
rollers
are
also
available
but these should not be
used unless the road
is a minor one
and
there
is
no
other
alter-
native.
5.6.2.
Compaction
of
sub-bases of moorum gravel, etc. will
be on the same lines
as
of subgrade
compaction.
Water
bound
macadam
requires
large
compactive
effort
for getting the aggre-
gates properly interlocked and
this
is
possible
only
with
power
rollers.
5.6.3.
Compaction
of
bituminous
layers can be done con-
veniently with 8/10 tonne three wheeled roller.
The
roller
wheels
have
to
be
kept
moist
to
prevent the mix from being picked up.
Bituminous Macadam and asphaltic concrete surfacing will
require
3-wheeled
roller
for
break
down
rolling
and
tandem roller for
finishing.
5.6.4.
The
normally
observed
productivities of 8/i0 tonne
roller in compacting different materials are given in Table
13.
5.7.
Soil Stabilisation
5.7.1.
Adequate
pulverisation
of
soil,
and
thorough
and
uniform mixing of stabilizer constitute essential requirements to
the
success
of
soil
stabilisation
works.
From this angle,
it would be
preferable to use mechanical equipment wherever possible.

prior

is
an
important
requirement.
For
such
soils,
mould-board
ploughs, disc harrows and off-set harrows hitched to
agricultural tractor which
is
often
used
for
agricultural
opera-
tions can
be
used.
The
tractor
should
be
of
about
50 HP
for depth of processing
upto
200 mm
and
110 HP where
the
depth goes upto 400 mm.
Mould-board plough
is
used
first
for
loosening
the
soil.
The
disc
harrow
is
then
passed
over
the



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 76
======================================================================
35
ploughed
soil
to
break
down
clods
further.
The
soil
is
then
processed further with off-set harrow.
After achieving the required
degree of
pulverisation,
the
soil
is
levelled,
moisture
content
adjusted, and the stabilizer
is spread over
it manually.
The ofT-set
harrow
is then used for 4-6 passes for mixing.
After levelling,
the
layer
is
compacted
with
power
roller.
For
heavy clays, pre-
treatment with lime may be adopted for aiding pulverisation
5.7.3.
The
purely manual method consists of cutting the soil
several time with hoe/spade for pulverising
it, then forming a
stack
and
adjusting
the
moisture,
spreading the stabilizer on the stack,
and turning over the material 4-6 times
till
it
is uniformally mixed.
This
method
should be adopted only where the needed equipment
is not avilable.
5.8.
Bituminous Works
5.8.1.
A
variety
of
bituminous constructions from thin sur-
face
dressing
to
dense
asphaltic
concrete
are
practiced
in
the
country.
Surface
dressing
though apparently simpler to construct
require uniform
spreading
of
bitumen
and
even
spreading
of
aggregates
before rolling.
The quick succession of the operations
is important to ensure that the aggregate get properly embedded in
the binder before the latter becomes hard, as otherwise
the
aggre-
gates
will
whip-off.
All
this
can
be possible and a good quality
surfacing
constructed
only
if
mechanical
sprayers
and
chip
spreaders are used.
In
the
absence
of truck-mounted
sprayers,
hand operated sprayers attached to a tar boiler may be used.
5.8.2.
Open-graded
premix
carpet
construction
requires
uniform coating of aggregates, and preferably hot mix plant is used
for the purpose though laying may be done manually. Mini hot mix
plant
of
6-8
tonne
carpacity
will be found suitable.
Where such
plant
is
not
available,
the aggregates can be heated in stacks with
fire
through
empty bitumen drums embedded in them, and mixing
done in a concrete mixer or improvised mixer. A sample calculation
for working out the resources for laying 20 mm thick premix carpet
with mini hot mix plant
is given in Table
14.
5.8.3.
Bituminous macadam
and
asphaltic
concrete mixes
should invariably
be
prepared
in
hot
mix

The operation, therefore, has to be equipment-

GUIDELINES ON PLANNING AND ORGANISATION OF
EQUIPMENT-INTENSIVE METHODS
6.1.
General
As
discussed
in
para
4,
the choice cf the most appropriate
technology for road works has several ramifications, and
is
not
to
be
based on micro-level cost comparsion alone.
For example,
for
the task of earthwork within a lead of 25
m,
the
labour
intensive
headbasket
method will be the most economical, but
if the work is
of large
magnitude
to
be
completed
within
a
stringent
time
schedule, or the required labour force
is not available, the job may
dictate
the
adoption
of equipment-intensive methods particularly
where the needed equipment
are
readily
available
at
site.
The
choice
will,
therefore,
have
to
be judicious taking all the related
parameters into account.
In
this
Section,
considerations
in
the
choice
of
the
appropriate equipment for the major tasks involved
in road construction and guidelines on their efficient utilisation
are
given
irrespective
of the fact whether the job may be done equally
well or not with labour based methods.
6.2.
General
Principles Governing the Selection of Machinery
6.2.1.
It
will
generally
be
necessary
to
have
a
good
experience
in
the
operation
and
upkeep
of equipment for satis-
factory
selection and handling.
The records which have been kept
for operating and maintenance of the
various
types
of equipment
and the actual output
obtained
under
comparable
conditions
of
previous projects will greatly assist in this
regard.
The
types
and
sizes
of equipment
available
to
accomplish
a
job
are
in
wide
variety and range, and for selecting the best
suited one,
it
would
be advantageous to consider the following factors
:
(i) The equipment
already
available
in
the project may be used even
though
it may not be the ideal
choice.
The
heavy
ownership
cost
involved
in
keeping
the
available equipment
idle may
offset the
increasd
cost
involved
in
its
operation
cost
vis-a-vis
the
ideal
alternative.

(ii) The capabilities of each type of equipment and the conditions
under
which they can work efficiently.
(iii) The
likely
output
of each machine and how this is affected by the
site conditions.
(iv) Co-ordination
of
the
different machines employed
on a job and
matching
of
their
sizes and types so that all the machines work to
full capacity.
(v) Organisation
available/required
for
the
efficient
operation
ana
maintenance of the machines.
tvi) Easy
mobility
of the plant particularly for cases where
it has to b«
shifted from place to place.
(vii) The type of work such as nature of soil, haulage distance,
restricted
space for working, etc.
(viii) Indigenous avaiJabiliy.
6.3.
Equipment Suitable for Earthwork
6.3.1.
Site clearance
:
The equipment suitable for
prepara-
tion
of
site,
clearing
and
grubbing
including removal of trees,
stumps and bushes
is the crawler tractor with dozer
blade
attach-
ment.
Other
attachments
like
rooter,
stumper, tree stinger, etc.
facilitate removal of trees and stumps.
The draw-bai horse power
(DHP)
of
the
tractor
should
be
90-120
for light clearance and
160-200 per heavy clearance.
6.3.2.
Earthwork
(1)
For cutting
earth
and pushing the cut material to short
leads, a bulldozer of about 100 DHP
is suitable.
For major dozing
and
removal
of excavated
rock,
a
larger sized dozer of 160-200
DHP would be necessary.
The economic lead for dozer
operation
is
about
100 m
for
crawler
dozer and 130 m for wheeled dozer.
While the crawler dozer is more appropriate for
working
on
soft/
muddy
soil
or
rough/rocky
formations,
the
wheeled
dozer
has
higher travel speeds which
is of advantage for longer hauls
and
in
easy
shifting
from
site to site.
If the material to be excavated in
too
hard
but
not
rock,
it
will
be
advantageous to rip
it by the
hydraulic
ripper attachment
at
the
back
of
the
tractor before
dozing is done.
(2)
For leads ranging between 100 — 1000 m, a scraper would
be preferable.
The scraper does the
entire
work
of
excavation,



======================================================================

40
loading
hauling
and
spreading
by
itself
without the help of any
other
equipment
except
perhaps
a pusher tractor.
Scrapers can
be towed or motorised.
For relatively short haul
distances
upto
about
300
m,
the crawler tractor pulling self-loading scraper can
move earth
economically.
Scrapers
commonly
used
for
road
works
have
10-13 cu.m. heaped capacity.
The tractor pulling the
scraper should havi 180—250 DHP.
These can
negotiate
steeper
grades,
require
less
haul
road
maintenance and can work under
more adverse conditions.
(3)
For
longer
naul distances, the low speed of the crawler
tractor becomes a bottleneck, and
it would be preferable to
go
in
for
self-propelled
motorised
scraner.
Normally,
motorised
scraper
requires
a pusher while loading.
A heavy duty tractor of
230—300 DHP
would
be
suitable
for the purpose.
One pusher
can help load several scrapers, the number
depending on the
load-
ing time and the cycle time of the scraper.
4
Some of the aspects involved in scraper operation are
:
(i) The scraper can excavate the material in lavers and require
a
fairly
long loading distance.
(ii) The
scrapers
can work
successfully only where the material is not
mixed with boulders or there are no rock outcrops.
If the
scrapers
are
to
be
used
with
very
hard
material (no; rock or boulders), it
will be necessary to have the area ripped by using
ripper attachment
on the crawler tractor.
(iii) The
productivity
of
a
scraper
heavily
hinges on the condition of
haul roads.
The haul roads should
be
firm, dust-free and
should
not have steep gradients to be negotiated on the
loaded
portion
of
the haul cycle.
(iv
. Scrapers
are
generally
used
in groups
at a location depending on
the
haul
distance.
This
is
from
the
angle
that
the expenses of
operating the
pusher
tractor
at
the borrow area and the levelling
tractor/grader at the
fill are? are distributed over a
large volume
of
earthwork and the equipment are not kept idle.
(5)
For
leads
beyond
1000 m, shovel-dumper
or front end
loader-dumper
combination
will
be
found
suita-ble.
Front
end
loadejs are either tracked or wheeled type and are
economical
for
a
range
upto 30 m.
This piece of equipment can be
used for light
excavation,
truck/dumper
loading
as
also
for
loading hoppers or
bins
of
hot
mix plants.
Loaders of 0 5 to 2
cu m.
capacity
are
made indigenously.

Motor grader is useful for spreading and grading of earth.
As
the
scraper
blade
can
be
adjusted
to
any angle in vertical
plane, the grader can be
effectively
used
of trimming and
main-
taining the side slope of embankments.
Grader is also
useful
for
road surface maintenance, ditching, stripping, scarifying and
finish-
ing operations. However,
for spreading and levelling earth dumped
by
rear
or
bottom
dumpers,
dozers would be required.
Motor
graders of 110 HP are manufactured indigenously.
6.4.
Output of Earthmoving Equipment
6.4.1.
General
(1)
Equipment
operation
essentially
comprises
a
series of
cyclic operations or cycles.
The probable output of
r\n
equipment
per
hour
can
be computed by multiplying the average net output
per cycle by the number of cycles per
hour.
The
cycle
time
for
a
machine
is
composed
of two components—fixed time and vari-
able time.
The variable time
is the time actually spent
on
travel-
ling
and
is
a
function
of
the distance travelled and the speed of
the unit.
The speed of travel depends on several job
factors
such
as
rolling
resistance,
grade
resistance,
altitude and power rating
of the equipment.
The fixed time comprises the time spent in
the
performance
of
all
operations other than travelling, such as load-
ing, dumping, turning, gear shifting, accelerating, etc.
(2)
In
production
operations,
the labour and equipment do
not work all the 60 minutes in an hour, and a value of
45-50
min/
nr. will be appropriate for day working and 40-45 min/hr
foi
night
operation.
The cycle time will, therefore, need to be corrected for
taking this aspect into
account.
Besides
this,
the
output
is
also
affected by job and management factors. The job factors which are
inherent in the job itself relate to site topography, available working
space,
climatic conditions, geology of the area affecting method
of
excavation, specification
of the
work,
etc.
Management
factors
pertain
to efficiency of the organisation and operating staff, appro-
priateness of
the equipment for the job, job planning, supervision,
maintenance of plants and haul roads, etc.
It is on the management
aspects that the Site Engineer should apply all his effort for
impro-
ving the efficiency and
productivity of the operations.

The output of earthmoving equipment is generally expres-
sed
in
terms
of
'bank measure' which is a measure of the soil in-
situ.
When the soil is excavated,
its volume increases and
it
is
in
this
loose
state
that
the
machines have to move the earth.
The
capacity ratings of
machines,
struck
or
heaped,
relate
to
loose
excavated
material.
The
loose
volume
can
be
converted
into
bank measure by applying the swell factor which
is given by
:
Swell factor =
100 + %Swell
The sweii factor may vary from 0.75 to 0.85 depending on the type
of the soil and
its compactness in-situ.
6.4.2.
Bulldozer
:
The loose
volume
excavated/dozed
per
t'ip
can
be
estimated
by
measuring
the area of the load profile
in front of the blade and multiplying
it by the
blade
length.
The
output may be estimated from
:
Output (bank volume)/hr
(Loose volume/trip) x
swell factor
X 60 X
efficiency
Cycle time in minutes
The efficiency factor in the equation has three components, namely,
operator efficiency (0.6—0.9), job efficiency (0.6—0 8) and soil hard-
ness.
Generally manufacturers of the equipment indicate the
pro-
ductivity
of
the
machines
under
ideal
conditions.
Taking
the
efficiency
factors
into
account,
it
will
generally be seen that the
?,c<ual productivity will be between 30 per cent (line
B
for
poorly
managed
jobs)
and
50 per cent (Line A for well managed jobs) of
the ideal productivity.
The corresponding values (Lines B and
A)
for dozers of 3 different capacities are plotted against haul
distance
upto
100 m
in
Fig
5.
Mean
of the values could be adopted for
planning purposes while the attempt during actual
working
should
be to achieve productivities corresponding to Line A.
6.4.3.
Scrapers—General
(1)
Scrapers are rated according to volume capacity,
struck
or
heaped
volume,
and
the
load capability.
Two scraper bowls
having the same struck capacity may have
different
heaped
capa-

A major share of cycle time for scrapers goes for
travel-
ling.
Proper
maintenance
of
haul
roads
is
therefore
of prim
;
importance for better productivity and reduced maintenance cost.



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 76

(3)
In scraper loading, the rate of filling the bowl diminishes
rapidly with the quantity of already loaded material, and
it will
be
preferable to keep the loading time to less than one minute.
(4)
The
output
can
be
determined
from
the
following
equation
:
In the cycle time, the fixed time includes the time
of loading
and
unloading
(done
at
the first gear) turning, gear shifting, accelera-
tion and deacceleration, all totalling to 4-5 minutes.
Variables time
is
a
function
of
speed of the unit and haul distance.
The
speed
depends on the available drawbar pull
vis-a-vis
the
required
pull
which depends on roiling resistance and grade.
6.4.4.
Towed scraper
:
As in the case of
dozers,
the
actual
output
will
be
30-50
per
cent
of
ideal
output indicated by the
manufacturers depending on
the
job/operator
efficiency
and
soil
c >ndition.
These vaiues are plotted (lines A
and
B)
for icrapers
of three struck capacities, viz. 9.2 cu.m.,
1 1.5 cu.m. and
13.8 cu m.

Motorised scraper
(1)
Motorised scrapers are assisted by pusher iractoi
during
oading
operation.
The
combined
tractive
effort
of the scraper
tractor
i.i d the pusher tractor, after allowing for resistances
(grade
no rolling) should be adequate to load the scraper by the desired
:mouut.
Number of scrapers that can be
served
by
cne
pusher
trictor can be estimated by the equation
:
Output (bank measured)/hr =
Optimum (loose) load X
swell factor
X
60 x
efficiency
Total cycle time in minutes
No. of scsapers per pusher =
Total cycle time of scraper
Total cycle time of pusher
for a scraper loading time of

time
will
be of the order of 2-3 minutes, depending upon the scraper volume
..ad job conditions.

The excavator/loader and the
hauling
units
should
be
properly
matched in size and number for optimum working.
As a
rough
guide,
the
size
of
hauling
unit may be fixed to provide a
capacity of 4 to 6 times the capacity of
the
loader
bucket.
After
selecting
two
or
three possible sizes, the number of haul units per
loader as also the unit cost of handling the
job
are
calculated
for
choosing the most economical alternative.
(4)
Sample calculations for finding the matching
number
of
haulage
units-for a job of earth excavation from side-hill and dum-
ping over a distance of 3 km are given
in Table
15.
Table

DATA
Ordinary earth is to be excavated from sloping
face.
Haul distance of loading
10 m.
Dump

are available.
Haulage for dumper is
3 km. Speed loaded =
15 km/h. Speed empty = 20 km/h. Swell factor = 0.8.

6.5.
Other Road Construction Equipment
6.5.1.
Compaction plant
(1)
Whether the job
is labour-based
or equipment
intensive,
power
rollers
are required.
For mechanisation of major highway
or airfield jobs,
it will be advantageous
to
go
in
for
heavier
and
higher efficiency compaction plants in place of the traditional three-
wheeled static rollers, for achieving better compaction
and
higher
productivity.
(2)
One such plant is the 8-10 tonne vibratory roller which
is
equivalent
in
compactive effort to 20-25 tonne static rollers.
The
principle
is that the vibrations imparted by the
roller drum
causes
the
particles
of
material
to
shift
themselves
into the tightest
arrangement.
This type of roller
is suitable for compacting
granu-
lar
soils,
granular
base
and sub-base materials and in the break-
down
rolling
of
bituminous
mixes.
Because
of
the
higher
compacting
efficiency,
higher
degree
of compaction can be achie-
ved, or a deeper
lift can be constructed with the
same number
of
passes.
(3)
Another specialised compaction
plant
is
the
pneumatic
tyred
roller
which
compacts
by the principle of kneading action.
This type of roller generally has two axles with four to nine
wheels
each.
The
wheels
are
arranged
so
that the rear ones run in the
spaces between the front ones, thus leaving no ruts.
The chassis of
the
vehicle
is
also
a
container
for solid or liquid ballast.
The
rollers which may be towed or
self-propelled
can
be
of
different
weights.
A
8-10
tonne
capacity
roller
is ideally suited for com-
pacting
surface
dressings
without
crushing
the
aggregate.
As
regards soil compaction, pneumatic tyred rollers will work on
most
types
of
soils
except heavy clays.
A heavier 40-50 tonne roller is
appropriate for achieving higher densities corresponding
to
modi-
fied AASHO
density
as is required for airfields and also for proof
rolling.
(4)
For compacting cohesive soils,
sheeproot
roller
is
the
suitable
equipment.
It
can
be
towed
or self-propelled, and the
units range in weight from 2 to 20 tonnes with feet projecting
from
175 to 225 mm.
Compaction starts from lower layers and proceeds



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 76
======================================================================
50
upwards and the roller is removed when the compaction
is complete.
The maximum depth which the roller can compact
is
about
5 cm
more than the length of the feet.
(5)
For optimum utilisation of the
compaction
plant,
it
is
essential
that
the
capacities
of
the
hauling and spreading plants
must be matched and be adequate so that none
of
the
equipment
remains idle.
6.5 2.
Watering for compaction
(1)
For earth compaction and compaction of similar materials
like
moorum,
the moisture content of the material before compac-
tion
will
have
to
be
adjusted
so as
to bring
it near about the
optimum moisture content.
Water bound macadam
construction
will
require
a
lot
of
water
during compaction for driving in the
filler material.
This water will have to
be
arranged
by
pumping
from
suitable
locations
and
brought
to
site for sprinkling on the
soil/material to be compacted.
(2)
Usually, two types of
water
tankers
are
used,
truck
mounted and trailer mounted
The tankers may
be
of 4000-5000
litre capacity fitted with sprinkler arrangement.
Where water
is to
be used continuously,
truck-mounted
tankers
which
have
higher
travel speeds may be convenient.
Trailer mounted
type
has
the
advantage
that
the
tractor
can be used in conjunction with 2 or 3
trailers so that the power unit dees not
remain
idle
during
filling.
The tractor can also be put to some other use at times when water-
ing is not required.
(3)
Productivity of water tankers can be calculated from the
unit
capacity
and
cycle
time.
As
in
the case of other hauling
equipment, the cycle time comprises
two
components,
fixed
time
involved
in
filling,
turning and spraying, and variable time which
depends on speed and haul distance.

of tractor-drawn
water
tanker for earthwork job.
6.5.3.
Air compressor

Air compressors of 3-4.5 cu.m/min capacity
operating
a
single
jack hammer
will
be very useful for
exploratory work on

hill road construction.
This unit
can
be
transported
by
manual
labour
or
by
animals
from
one site to another
For subsequent
development
work,
air
compressors
of 6-10 cu.m/min
capacity
operating two jack hammers would be found suitable.
(2)
The output of a compressor and the air
consumption
of
pneumatic
tools
are
affected by altitude and humidity, while per-
formance
is affected by
the
loss
of
pressure
in
the
pipelines.
Adequate
care
should
be taken to ensure that all the connections
are tight and there
is no leakage in the system.
6.5.4.
Stone crushing plant
:
For production
of
aggregate,
stone
crushers
of
400 mm x 225 mm
and
400 mm x 280 mm
capable of producing 14— 18 tonnes/hr are
suitable.
Granulators
of sizes 300 mm x
175 mm and 300 mm x
100 mm are capable of
yielding 5—8 tonnes/hr, and are suitable for producing smaller size
aggregates.
For major construction jobs requiring large
quantities
of aggregates,
it
will
be
advantageous
to
install
100—150
t/hr
capacity base crushers and 50 — 100 t/hr secondary crushers.
6.5.5.
Hot mix plant
:
Hot-mix
plants of
20—30 tonne/hr
or 30—45 tonne/hr capacity can
be
used for
mechanised
paving
works
in
conjunction
with
tipper
trucks
and
paver-finisher.
Generally, such plants in one location can cater
for 20— 30 km of
road on either side.
For optimum
working
of
the
system,
the
following points need attention
:
(i) All the materials needed for the plant must
be available
at site
in
time.
It will be preferable if aggregates required for atleast
15 days
are stock piled at
site.
(ii) The number of tipper trucks must be matched with the plant output.
(iii) The work of cleaning the road surface and applying tack coat should
proceed sufficiently in advance
so that
the paving
work
need not
have to stop on this account.
(iv) Front end loaders of
adequate
capacity should
be employed
for
loading cold feed bins.

COST CALCULATIONS
7.1.
General
7.1.1.
Cost calculations
in
road
construction projects
are
necessary for the following purposes
:
(i) Cost comparison at
the
task
level
for
the
different
technically
feasible construction methods for selecting
the
least cost
method.
The costing is usually done in terms
of unit
costs, i.e.
the cost per
unit of output, for example, cost per cu.m. of earthwork.
(ii) Cost
comparison
for
the
choice
of
pavement
materials.
For
example, prospecting
of
aggregates
from a
quarry
may
involve
higher initial installation cost but lower
haulage
cost
compared to
another alternative.
Similarly comparison may be required
for the
use of permissible but poorer locally
available
pavement
material
which has to be used in larger thickness vis-a-vis
a
better
material
available from longer distances.
(iii) Costing of the total job for the
preparation
of financial
estimates
for processing and sanction by the appropriate authorities.
7.1.2.
For all the
purposes
mentioned
above, the
starting
point will be the unit cost. The unit cost of a task can be calculated
by multiplying the input coefficient for
the
resources
performing
the task by the rate for the resource.
The rate
is the
cost of the
resource per unit of time, e.g. per hour or
per
day, except
in the
case of construction materials when
it is the. cost per
cu.m.
tonne,
etc.
If two or more resources are involved in the task, the product
of input coefficient and rate
should
be
calculated
separately
for
each item and the products added.
7.2.
Costing of Labour-based Methods
7.2.1.
Tables 4
through
9
give
the input
coefficients
for
different labour-based activities as derived from the
World
Bank
Study.
The input
coefficients
are in
terms
of working
time in
ours, and their reciprocals give the output per man-hour (working
time).
The output per man-day can be calculated by
knowing the
working hours in a day which may be
5.5— 6
hours
for daily-paid
wage system and 8 hours for the incentive piecework system.



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 76
======================================================================
55
7.2.2.
The cost of unit output of an activity can be computed
by multiplying the input coefficient and the rate
per working hour.
The rate for daily paid labour
which
is on
day basis
is governed
by statutory minimum wages.
The
day
wage
can be
converted
into working hourly wage by dividing the
former
by the
effective
working hours in a day.
For example, unit cost of excavation
can
be calculated as follows
:
Input coefficient (ordy. soil,
daily paid labour, Table 4)
=
0.8 man/hr (WT/cu.m)
Working hours in a day
=» 6 hrs
Wage rate
= Rs 6/day
Working hourly rate
=•
6/6 = Re
1
Cost of activity
=
0.8 x
1 = Rs 0.8/cu.m.
Output per labourer
=
-^-L- x 6 = 7.5 cu.m./day
7.2.3.
For tasks
involving
more
than
one
resource,
e.g.
labour,
animal
cart,
etc.,
the
unit
cost
for each resource
is
calculated and added together for finding the
total unit cost.
An
example of excavation, loading, hauling and unloading earth
using
animal cart
is illustrated below
:
Excavation input coefficient
=
0.8 man-hr/cu.m.
Loading input coefficient
=
0.98 man-hr/cu.m.
(height of loading 1.5 m)
Excavation
-f
Loading
=
1.78 man-hr/cu.m.
Input coefficient for hauling and
unloading by animal cart
(assumed)
=
0.75 cart hr/cu.m.
Labour rate
= Re 1/hr (WT)
Cart rate (including driver)
= Rs 3/hr (WT)
Unit cost of labour
=
1.78 x
1 = Rs 1.78/c.um.
Unit cost of cart
=
0.75 x
3 = Rs 2.25/cu.m.
Unit cost of task
=
1.78 + 2.25 = Rs 4.03/cu.m.
7.3.
Costing of Equipment-intensive Methods
7.3.1
The cost of using capital equipment is usually
divided
into four broad heads, namely
:
(i) Ownership charges relating to the cost of the equipment
brought to
site spread over the expected working hours
during
its life
till
it is
sold out or scrapped.



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 76
======================================================================
56
(ii) Repair charges.
(iii) Running
charges which
include
wages
of
operators and
cost
of
POL. etc.
(iv) Overhead charges.
The usually accepted norms
for calculating the
usage
charges of
equipment are given in Table
18.
Table 18.
Norms for Calculating Usage Charges of Machines
OWNERSHIP CHARGES
(A) Total investment

IV. RUNNING CHARGES
(a)
Diesel oil consumption

,jtres/hour
= 0.154 x BHP litres/hour (Approx.)

0.00_6 x C x
3<785 ]itres/hour
Where C = 0.06 x BHP
t = time for changing oil = 100 hrs
(c)
Other lubricants, grease, cotton \varte etc. are assumed to cost twice
the
cost of lubricating oil in the case of hea\y machinery and the same
cost
in the case of others.
(d)
Wages for operating staff— For staff on regular strength,
the annual
wages is divided by the annua' utilisation in hours in a year.
V. OVERHEAD CHARGES
Taken as 5% of the total charges per hour.
Notes
:
1.
Repair charges
i H) taken as equal to 150
per
cent
of
depreciation
reflects the average for both wheeled and tracked vehicles considered
together.
This
can also be calculated in one other way. namely, by
separating out the cost of replacement tyres and
the
repair
charges
for other items.
2. The diesel oil consumption depends on the condition and age of
the
engine,
and
the
equation given in IV (a)
is for average conditions.
The load factor for different machines
also
varies,
and
the
value
0.6 represents
average
conditions.
The
oil consumption
is for the
prime mover and does not include that for
heating
aggregates
etc.
as in the case of hot mix plants.
3.
Interest charges have not been
added
in
the
calculations.
These
will, however, have to be included where a machine is given
out
to
contractors or for economic analysis.
7.3.2.
The usage charges
for some
of the
commonly used
earth moving equipment are worked out in
Table
19.
For
other
equipment too, the charges can be computed on similar lines.

The calculations for the labour and equipment
methods are
given
in Tables 20 and 21 below
:
Table 20.
Cost of Earthwork by Manual Methods
A.
SHORT HAUL (20 m)
The same case as worked out in Table
1
1
is taken.
The productivity for a gang of 20 persons ==
15.5 cu.m/hr
= 124 cu.m/day
Usually a pieceworker earns about twice
that of a daily
paid
worker.
Assuming
the daily earnings as Rs 12/day, cost per
cu.m (bank measure)
B.
LONG HAUL (3 km)
The same case as worked out in Table 12 is taken.
The productivity of a gang of 22 men plus one 5-t
flat-bed truck was 36 cu.m/day.
Wages for Labour
= 22 x
12 = Rs 264/day
Usage charges for truck
= Rs 50/hr
—for 8 working hrs.
= Rs 400
Cost per cu.m. (bank measure) = 664/36
= Rs 18,4
Note
:
The
cost
figures do
not take into account incidental expenses such as
those on labour mobilisation, provision of
health,
travel
and
accom-
modation facilities to labour, small tools and plant, etc.
Also,
it should
be
understood that the unit wage rate assumed
is only for the purposes
of this example, and the actual prevailing/statutory
wage
rates
should
be applied for actual cases.

Productivity
: Taken
as

(average conditions) in Fig. 5
Calculations
: Productivity
of dozer = 80 cu.m/hr (from Fig. 5)
Usage charges for
dozer
= Rs 190/hr (from Table 19)
Cost per cu.m
= 190/80 = Rs 2.4
B.
LONG HAUL (3 km)
The
same case as worked out in Table 15 is considered.
The productivity
of 1.15 cu.m loader/excavator and 8 tipper trucks wi?l be 67 cu.m/hr.
Usage charges for loader
= Rs 168
Usage charges for 8 trucks
= 8 x 63 = Rs 504
Cost of spreading (using
= Rs 190
90 HP Dozer)
Total usage cost/hr
= Rs 862
Cost per cu.m
= 862/67 = Rs 12.9

(ii) Equipment method
Cost/cu.m (bank measure) Rupees

This would show that while the labour methods will
be
generally
cheaper for shorter
hauls,
equipment methods
would
be
more
economical for longer hauls.
7.4.2.
As discussed
in
detail in
the earleir sections,
each
method has
its own advantages and disadvantages,
and the choice
has to be judicious talking all the
factors into
account.
Whatever
be the method chosen, the objective should be to look for measures
for improving the productivity through
organisational
and mana-
gerial measures.
While
motivation
of a
large labour
force for
