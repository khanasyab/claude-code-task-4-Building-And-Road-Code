2. SCOPE
This document covers the specifications and
constmction of bituminous prime coat for laying
over granular surface and tack coat over primed
granular surface, bituminous or cement concrete
pavement.
3. PRIME COAT OVER GRANULAR
BASE
3.1
Definitions and Objectives
3.1.1
Priming
is spraying of low viscosity
liquid bituminous materials on the surface of
non-bituminous
granular
base
course
preparatory
to
the
superimposition
of
bituminous
treatment.
The
objectives
of
priming a granular surface are as under:
(i)
to
penetrate
the
existing
base
course
surface
so
as
to
plug
capillary voids in it.
(ii)
to coat and bond loose mineral
particles on
the
surface of the
base course.
(iii)
to
seal surface pores and make
the
surface of the base
course
water-resistant.
(iv)
To provide adhesion between the
base
and
the
superimposed
bituminous
surface
course
in
conjunction with a tack coat.
3.1.2 Prime Coat
is not to be regarded as a
substitute
for
tack
coat,
the
objective
of
which is to ensure a proper bond between the
surface being paved and the new bituminous
course being placed over it.
3.2
Materials
3.2.1 The bituminous material to be used as
primer should be such that
it can penetrate
deep into base course (about 10 mm depth) to
perform
its
intended
function
in
an
environment
friendly
manner.
Bitumen
emulsion or medium curing cutback bitumen
can be used as primer.
3.2.2 Cationic bitumen emulsion SS-1 grade
conforming to IS:8887/ASTM D2397 shall
be used as primer. The quantity of SS- 1 grade
bitumen
emulsion
for
various
types
of
granular
surfaces
shall be
as
per Table
1.
Cutback should not be prepared in the field.

is
to be decided by
the
supervising engineer
at the
site to achieve
desired penetration of 1 0 mm.
3.3
Construction
3.3.1
Weather and seasonal limitations
Cutback Bitumen as Primer shall not
be applied on a damp or wet surface. Bitumen
emulsion shall be applied on a damp surface.
Surface
shall be just wet with very
light
sprinkling
of
water.
Primer
shall
not
be
applied during dust storm,
rainy, foggy or
windy weather.
The ambient temperature
during priming by bitumen emulsion should
be above 10°C.
condition at site. The primer distributor shall
be a self propelled or towed bitumen pressure
sprayer equipped for spraying the material
uniformly at specified rates and temperature.
Hand spraying of small areas using pressure
hand sprayer may be permitted
at specific
strategic locations, where distributor
is not
accessible
or
if narrow
strips of (<
3 m)
granular surface are to be primed. Pouring of
primer using perforated can should not be
permitted.
SS-1
grade
bitumen
emulsion
stored
at
site
in
the
tank
shall
have
arrangement like circulation pump to ensure
its proper mixing before withdrawal from
tank and transfer to browser.
3.3.3 Preparation ofsurface
The base course surface to be primed
shall be swept clean and made free from dust.
All loose material and other foreign material
on the surface shall be removed completely.
Power brooms or mechanical sweepers may



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 20
======================================================================
IRC: 16-2008
be used for cleaning of surface. The surface to
be primed (whether with SS-1 emulsion or
medium curing cutback bitumen) should be
kept dry in case cutback is used as primer.
If
Soil/Moorum binder has been used
in the
WBM surface, part of this should be brushed
and removed up to a depth of 2 mm so as to
provide good bond.
The dilution of SS-1 bitumen emulsion is
not permitted.
3.3.4
Application ofprimer
After the base to be primed has been
prepared as in section 3.3.3, the primer shall
be uniformly applied using the appropriate
equipment
at
application
rate
specified
in
Table
1
or 2 as
applicable. The spraying
should be carried out using pressure sprayer
or distributor. The method of application of
primer
will
also
depend
on
the
type
of
equipment
to
be
used,
size
of
nozzles,
pressure at spray bar and speed of the forward
movement of vehicle. A trial section shall be
laid to check the efficacy ofequipment as well
as penetration depth (10 mm) of the priming
material.
3.3.5 Temperature
of
application
of
primer
No heating of SS- 1 bitumen emulsion
is permitted at site.
In
case
of
cutback
bitumen, temperature ofapplication ofprimer
should be high enough to permit the primer to
be sprayed effectively through the jets of the
spray bar and to cover the base course surface
effectively. The temperature of product at the
time ofapplication should be more than 10°C.
3.3.6 Air curing and opening of traffic
The primed surface shall be allowed to
cure for at least 24 hours or any other higher
period, as is found to be necessary to allow all
the moisture or volatiles to evaporate before
any subsequent bituminous surface treatment
or mix
is
laid.
Excessive and unabsorbed
primer if any,
shall be blotted with a light
application
of
sand
using
the
minimum
quantity possible. A primed surface shall not
be opened for traffic other than that necessary
construction
vehicles
to
lay
the
next
bituminous course.
3.3.7 Arrangement for traffic
During
the
period
of
construction,
appropriate arrangement for traffic diversion
shall be made as specified in IRC:SP:55 to
prevent
any
possible
damage
of primed
surface.
3.4
Quality Control
The
Quality
Control
shall
be
undertaken as under:

4. TACK COAT
4.1.
Definition
Tack Coat is a very light application of
low viscosity liquid bituminous material to an
existing
bituminous,
cement
concrete
or
primed granular surface
to ensure
a bond
between
the
surface being paved and
the
overlaying course. The tack coat material is
not expected to penetrate into pavement and
for
this reason;
the applications should be
very light to provide adequate bond between
two layers.
4.2.
Materials
The binder used for tack coat shall be either
Cationic BitumenEmulsion (RS- 1 ) conforming to
4

======================================================================
IRC: 16-2008
IS: 8887/ASTM D 2397 or suitable low viscosity
pavingbitumenofVG 10gradecoiifoimingtoIS:73.
The use of cutback bitumen RC-70
(in cold
climate) as per IS:217 shall be restricted only for
sites where atmospheric temperature at the time of
application reaches below 0°C or for emergency
applications.
4.3
Construction
4.3.1
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Bituminous
material
shall
not
be
applied during rainy season, dust storm or
when the weather is foggy, rainy or windy or
when the ambient temperature
is
less than
1 0°C. The surface should be totally dry in case
of cutback bitumen. However, when using
bitumen emulsion as tack coat, the surface
should be slightly damp, but shall not be wet.
4.3.2
Equipment
The tack coat shall be applied by a
self-propelled
or towed bitumen
pressure
sprayer equipped for spraying the material
uniformly at a specified rate. Hand spraying
may be permitted where tack coat
is to be
applied on small
areas, inaccessible
to the
distributor, or in narrow strips, with a pressure
hand
sprayer.
Pouring of tack
coat using
perforated can may be permitted in case of
patchwork but
shall
not be
permitted
for
major road works.
4.3.3
Preparation ofbase
The surface on which the tack coat is
to be applied shall be clean and free from dust,
dirt and any extraneous material. The granular
or stabilized surface shall be primed as per
specifications given in Clause 3 of this Code.
Immediately before the application of tack
coat, the surface shall be swept clean with a
mechanical broom and high-pressure air jet or
by other means as directed by the Engineer.
4.3.4 Application oftack coat
4.3.4.1 The rate of application for tack coat on
various
types
of surfaces
shall be
as
per
Table 3 and shall be applied uniformly. The
quantity of cutback, when used as tack coat,
will be same as that ofemulsion.
4.3.4.2
The method of application of tack
coat will also depend on the type ofequipment
to be used, size of nozzles, pressure at spray
bar and speed of the forward movement of
vehicle. A spraying
trial
shall demonstrate
that the equipment and method to be used is
capable of providing a uniform spray, within
specified tolerance limit. The quantity oftack
coat shall be checked periodically using tray
coating test as described in Appendix 2. The
dilution of RS-1
bitumen emulsion
is
not
permitted.
4.3.5 Temperature of application
of tack
coat
No heating of RS- 1 Bitumen Emulsion
is permitted at site.
Paving Bitumen if used
shall be heated to its appropriate application
temperature
in
bitumen
boiler
to
achieve
desired viscosity of less than 2 poise. The

to be sprayed effectively through the jets of
the spray bar and to cover the base course
surface uniformly.
In case of the use of
paving grade bitumen, viscosity at the time of
application shall be less than 2 poise so that
spraying is uniform
.
4.3.6
Curing of tack coat
After application of the Emulsion as
tack
coat,
allow
the bitumen emulsion
to
break
i.e
turn
black
before
placing
the
bituminous mixture or overlay. Traffic should
be kept offofthe area where tack coat is being
sprayed.
No
Plant
or
vehicles
shall
be
allowed on the tack
coat other than those
essential for construction.
4.3.7
Arrangements for traffic
During
the
period
of
construction,
appropriate
arrangements
for
traffic
diversion shall be made.
4.4
Quality Control
Tests
to
be
conducted on
bitumen,
cutback bitumen and bitumen emulsion
are
given
in
Appendix-1.
Manufacturer
shall
provide
test
certificate
for
each
batch
indicating date of manufacture, batch number
and signature of quality control in charge. The
details of tray test for measurement of quantity
are given in Appendix -2.
The
Quality
Control
shall
be
undertaken as under:-
Test
Frequency of Tests
Quality of Binder
test per batch of
product by the
manufacturer
One set of test for a
tanker or lot of 1 0 tonne
as per IS:73 for bitumen
and IS:8887 for bitumen
emulsion (Appendix- 1)
Binder Temperature
for application
Regular Intervals
Rate of spread of
binder
1 test per
1 000 m
2 and not
less than two tests per day

APPENDIX -
1
Quality Tests for Tack Coat and Prime
Coat
In case of bitumen emulsion residue
on
600
micron
sieve,
viscosity
test and
storage stability tests shall be conducted at
site.
In case of cutback bitumen, viscosity
test, flash point test and residue test shall be
conducted at site.
In case of paving grade
bitumen, viscosity at 60°C and 160°C shall be
determined.
APPENDIX - 2
Method of Test for Measurement of
Spread of Binder for Prime Coat and
Tack Coat
Aluminum or other light metal tray of
200 mm x 200 mm size and 20 mm depth are
to be used. A set ofthree plates is essential for
one test. All the plates are to be weighed and
numbered. These are placed at intervals of 1
0
m along the road in path between wheels of
bitumen
distributor.
After the
distributor
crosses a length of 50 m,
trays
are
to be
removed
and
wrapped
in
weighed
polyethylene
bags
so
that
these
can
be
handled, stocked safely for further weighing
in laboratory. The trays shall be weighed to
first place of decimal. Similarly, transverse
distribution of liquid bituminous
material
can be checked by placing three numbers of
plates
at interval of 50 cm in the path of
binder spraying equipment.
