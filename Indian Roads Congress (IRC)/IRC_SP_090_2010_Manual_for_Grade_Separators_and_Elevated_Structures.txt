MANUAL FOR GRADE SEPARATORS AND ELEVATED STRUCTURES
1 INTRODUCTION
On account
of phenomenal growth
of vehicle
population on
both highways and
urban areas, there
is an increasing demand to eliminate traffic bottlenecks at road
intersections by providing grade separated structures for safe passage of pedestrians
and
vehicles. Such
structures
segregate
traffic moving
in
different
directions
at
road intersections and are also known as flyovers, underpasses/over passes. The
ROB/RUB and LHSs are also grade separated structures for free passage of highway
traffic across Railway lines.
The General Design Features (Bridges & Grade Separated Structures (B-1 ) Committee
was constituted in 2009 with the following personnel:

The revised draft was approved by Bridges Specifications & Standards Committee in
its meeting held on 1.5.2010 and subsequently, the Executive Committee approved
the same in
its meeting held on 10.5.2010 and authorized Secretary General, IRC to
place the same before the Council.The modified document was approved by the IRC
Council in
its meeting held on 22.5.2010 at Munnar (Kerala) for printing.
2 SCOPE
,
This Manual covers various aspects and
practices
required
to be considered
in the
Planning,
Design, Construction and Maintenance of
all the forms of grade separated
structures including Flyovers, RGBs, RUBs, Underpasses, Subways, Pedestrian or Foot
Gver Bridges and Interchanges both for urban as well as rural or non-urban situations. The
requirements and provisions of this Manual may be followed wherever applicable, except
in cases where local site conditions, byelaws or other regulations require othenA/ise.
The relevant provisions of the IRC Codes will prevail for these structures also.
These structures shall be provided only at locations where the volume and intensity
of traffic has become excessive of the capacities, defined
in subsequent Chapters
of level traffic managements systems, e.g., signals, railway gates, rotaries and
split
rotaries
etc. or where otherwise required from various other considerations or part
of future planning. The shape, form and arrangement of the grade separator system
shall be decided as per the guidelines given in this Manual.
3 REFERENCE OF IRC AND OTHER CODES
IRC Codes generally deal with river bridges as well as land based bridges & flyovers.
Several provisions related with water flow contained in IRC Codes will, therefore, not be
applicable for Grade Separators. Conditions of exposure, loading and dynamic effects
due to fast moving vehicles make these structures quite different than
river bridges
and other structures. Hence, grade separators and Elevated Structures
require some
other considerations in their planning and design. The following IRC and other Codes,
however, are relevant:

wheel guards.
4.16
Straight Ramps or Loop Ramps
An inter-connecting roadway or any connection between highways at different levels,
or between
parallel highways, on which vehicles may enter or leave a designated
roadway. The components of ramp are a terminal at each end and a connecting road,
usually with some curvature and on a grade.
4.17
Interchange
An interchange
is a grade separated intersection with connecting roadways (ramps
and loops) for turning traffic between highway approaches.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
4.20
Non Urban Roads
Non-urban roads
in the country are
(i) Expressways
(ii) National Highways (NH),
(iii) State Highways (SH), (iv) Major District Roads (MDR), (v) Other District Roads (ODR),
(vi) Village Roads (VR).
4.21
Service Road (SR)
A Service Road
is an auxiliary road that runs parallel to a controlled access highway
that
provides access for the adjoining property
at a few selected places.
4.22
Urban Roads
Urban roads are classified into the following five categories:
i)
Elevated Highways: The function of elevated highways is to cater for fully
or partially
access controlled movement of heavy volumes of motor traffic
at high speeds. They connect major points of traffic generation and are
intended to serve trips of medium and long length between large residential
areas, industrial or commercial concentrations and the central business
district. They are divided highways with high standards of geometries and
full or partial control of access. Parking, loading and unloading of goods
and passengers are not permitted on these highways.
ii)
Arterial Streets: This system
of
streets,
along
with expressways
where they exist, serves as the
principal network for through
traffic
flows. Significant intra-urban travel such as between central business
district and
outlying
residential areas or between major sub-urban
centers takes place on this system. These streets may generally be
spaced at less than
1 .5 km in highly developed central business areas
and at 8 km or more
in sparsely divided highways with
full or partial
access. Parking, loading and unloading activities are usually restricted
and regulated. Pedestrians are allowed to cross only at intersections.
iii)
Sub-arterial Streets: These are functionally similar to arterial streets
but with somewhat lower level of travel
mobility. Their spacing may
vary from about 0.5 km in the central business district to 3-5 km in the
sub-urban fringes.
iv)
Collector Streets: The function of collector streets is to collect traffic
from
local streets and feed
it to the
arterial and sub-artehal streets
or vice-versa. These may be located
in residential neighbourhoods,
business areas and industrial areas. Normally,
full access
is allowed
on
these
streets from
abutting
properties. There
are few
parking
restrictions except during the peak hours.
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
v)
Local Streets: These are
intended
primarily
to
provide access
to
abutting property and normally do not carry large volumes of traffic.
Majority of trips
in urban areas either originate from or terminate on
these streets. Local streets may be residential, commercial or industrial,
depending on the predominant use of the adjoining land. They allow
unrestricted parking and pedestrian movements.
4.23
Speed
\t
is the rate of motion of individual vehicles of a
traffic stream.
It
is measured
in
meters per second, or more generally as kilometers per hour. Two types of speed
measurements are commonly used
in traffic flow analysis; viz.
(i) Time mean speed
and
(ii) Space mean speed. For the purpose of these guidelines, the speed measure
used
is "Space mean speed".
4.24
Time Mean Speed
It is the mean speed of vehicles observed at a point on the road over a period of time.
It is the mean spot speed.
4.25
Space Mean Speed
It is the mean of vehicles in a traffic stream at any instant of time over a certain length
(space) of road.
In other words, this
is average speed based on the average travel
time of vehicles to traverse a known segment of roadway.
It
is slightly less
in value
than the time mean speed.
4.26
Volume (or Flow)
It
is the number of vehicles at a given point on the road during a designated time
interval. Since roads have a certain width and a number of lanes are accommodated
in that width, flow is always expressed in relation to the given width (i.e. per lane or per
two lanes etc.). The time unit selected
is an hour or a day. ADT is the Average Daily
Traffic when measurements are taken for a few days. AADT
is the Annual Average
Daily Traffic when measurements are taken for 365 days of the year and averaged
out.
4.27
Density (or Concentration)
!t is the number of vehicles occupying a unit length of road at an instant of time. The
unit length
is generally one kilometer. Density is expressed
in relation to the width of
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
the road (i.e. per lane or per two lanes etc.). When vehicles are in a jammed condition,
the density is maximum.
It is then termed as the jamming density.
4.28
Capacity
It is defined as the maximum hourly volume (vehicles per hour) at which vehicles can
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during
a given time period under the prevailing roadway, traffic and control conditions.
4.29
Design Service Volume
It
is defined as the maximum hourly volume at which vehicles can reasonably be
expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a given time
period under the prevailing roadway, traffic and control conditions while maintaining a
designated level of service.
4.30
Peak Hour Ratio
It is defined as the traffic volume during peak hour expressed as a percentage of the
AADT. The peak hour volume in this case is taken as the highest hourly volume based
on actual traffic counts.
5 PLANNING
5.1
Collection of Data
The requirement of a grade separator,
its shape, size, type and configuration at any
location is decided by collecting sufficient relevant data and information and analyzing
it with respect to volume, intensity and type of traffic, loadings, climatic conditions and
geotechnical investigations, space restraints and limitations because of underground
and overhead
utilities services and
available geometries,
traffic
regulation
during
construction etc.
All this data as discussed subsequently, should be collected and then studies and
investigations should be properly and adequately done
for deciding the various
parameters for planning, layout, design and construction and maintenance etc.
5.2
Organizations Involved
Construction

Traffic Studies
For detailed planning of such facilities which have to be related to the desired level of
service along such corridors,
it becomes necessary to study, in detail, the present and
expected future characteristics of traffic at such locations. The following
surveys
are
required
to be carried out for making these studies
:
•
Road Inventory Survey
Classified Traffic Volume Survey
Turning Movement Count Survey
Vehicle Occupancy Survey
Roadside Origin-Destination Survey
•
Vehicle Speed and Delay Survey
Intersection Volume - Delay Survey
5.6.1
Road inventory survey
Road Inventory Survey provides the details of road and street network. Enumerators
collect the information on the field sheets which are maps drawn
in a large suitable
scale. A typical survey party consists of a party leader (one), observer and recorder
(one) and tape holders (two). The typical information collected from road inventory
survey are
:
Width of Carriageway
Width of Footpath
Location of Traffic Signal Posts
Location of Traffic Signs/Advertising Boards
Location of Bus Stops/Shelters
Width of Central Divider
Location of Lamp Poles
Location of Manholes

5.6.2
Classified traffic volume survey
Classified volume establishes the magnitude of traffic by different types of vehicles for
each hour of the day. Classified Traffic Volume Survey can be carried out manually
as well as with the use of automatic traffic counters. By
utilizing the data obtained
from permanent traffic counting stations, 24 hours traffic volume can be expanded for
any particular day, month or season to a representative annual average daily traffic
(ADT) volume. ADT volumes are used for evaluation of traffic flow with respect to the
existing roadway system measurement of present-demand for service by roadway and
planning of location of new facilities, new route selection and evaluation of alternative
traffic management actions.
5.6.3
Turning movement count survey
Turning movement counts
at junctions are
important
for the design
of junction,
channelization,
capacity
analysis,
traffic
signal
timing and
phasing,
turn
lanes,
parking and turning
restrictions. Turning movement counts should be conducted
manually and recorded
in 15 minutes interval according to lane movement and by
vehicle classification. Peak hours (morning and evening) are sufficient for most of
the situations. Standard forms are used for data collection for turning movement
count survey.
Turning movement surveys at complex intersection:
At complex intersections where the turning movement
will be
difficult to observe,
particularly
at
rotaries,
recording of the
registration number plate
will be used
for
collection of the base turning movement data at site during 8 hours dividing
into 4
hours each, during the morning and evening peak periods, so as to cover the peak
traffic during morning and evening periods.
_
The data analysis methodology for turning count surveys
will be as per guidelines
stipulated in IRC:SP:41.
5.6.4
Vehicle occupancy survey
Vehicle occupancy survey determines the occupancy of passengers
in each vehicle.
This survey establishes the traffic volume in terms of number of persons by different types
of vehicle crossing at a given point. The analysis of vehicle occupancy survey data and
junction delay survey data provide valuable inputs in economic analysis of the project.

5.6.5
Roadside origin and destination survey for non-urban roads
'
Origin-destination surveys are designed to identify the travel pattern and thus allow
transport planners to analyze the existing traffic pattern and project future transportation
requirements. A study
is made of the daily travel characteristics by taking sample
of all travelers. A cordon
is established around the study area. Depending upon the
objective of the study, questionnaires are prepared and questions are asked from a
sample of people entering/leaving the cordon. Generally, the question include origin
and destination of their trips, trip purpose, trip time, frequency of trips etc. The survey
data
is coded and then computerized. The computer analysis of the data assists the
transport planner to
project inter-zonal movements, mode preference and desires
of particular population. This study should be made on need basis depending upon
complexity of the grade separator.
5.6.6
Vehicle speed and delay survey
Vehicle speed-delay survey
is necessary for economic studies such as, cost-benefit
analysis for transport facilities. Congestion can be evaluated by means of speed and
delay studies. There are several methods which can be used for speed-delay survey.
These are:
Test car method
License plate method
Estimate of volume and travel time using moving vehicle
Interview method
Test car method is generally recommended because of proven reliability and simplicity.
The "average speed" technique using this method
is one in which the driver of a test
vehicle travels at the speed that
in his opinion
is representative of all
traffic at that
time. An observer seated in the vehicle utilizes two stop watches for timing purposes.
The
first watch
is started
at the beginning of the test run and records the time at
various control
points along the
route. The second watch
is used to measure the
length of individual stopped time delays. The time, location and cause of these delays
are recorded either on forms or by voice recording equipment. The data is summarized
and filed by road segment. Speed maps can be prepared showing morning, evening
and off-peak speeds for each road segment under the study. The survey data could
be easily computerized for further analysis.

5.6.7
Intersection volume-delay survey
The Intersection volume delay survey
is conducted at any intersection of interest to
provide a detailed evaluation of the stopped time delay of either vehicular or pedestrian
traffic. For justification of grade separator, intersection volume-delay survey is a must.
The application of the information could also be made for the development of proper
timing sequences for traffic signals, calculation of delay costs in the economic analysis
of highway and traffic improvements and evaluation of geometries that are critical
in
intersection design.
Sampling procedure
is to be used for stopped time delay method. This involves
the counting of the number of vehicles stopped
in the intersection approach
at
successive
intervals. This sampling along with volume count (during the same
time observations are made) permits estimating the vehicle stopped time delay.
As a guide, sampling interval should not be an even subdivision of cycle length.
The study team consisting of seven members positions
itself at one of the four
approaches of an intersection, records the data for a six minute duration (also six
such consecutive observations) then rotates to next approach
till
all approaches
are covered.
5.7
Deciding the Type of Facility
Grade separators essentially segregate traffic in space and depending upon prevailing
and expected traffic characteristics, present and proposed development plans for the
area, site constraints and environmental considerations, could take various forms.
The type and
classification of the grade separated
facilities to be provided at any
particular junction or crossing will mainly depend on the following factors:
i)
Location Attributes- whether in open areas or habitated or urban
areas
ii)
Traffic requirements based on the interpretation and analysis of
traffic studies made and data collected
iii)
Future development plans
iv)
Roadway
Classification and
Capacity
v)
Level of service required
vi)
Local restraints - ROW, underground and above ground utilities and
services and environmental issues
vii)
Design and construction requirements

IRC:SP:90-2010
The importance of roads and volume of traffic on them will usually decide which one
would remain at level and which one would
fly over the other. Lesser important and
lower
traffic volume roads should
fly over
the other unless there are some specific
considerations or constraints.
5.7.1
Location attributes
Generally speaking flyovers
in open areas are not confronted with the same degree
of site constraints as in the case of flyovers in town/urban areas,
it is mainly because
of this reason that flyovers/grade separators
in open areas tend to take more liberal
forms than those in urban areas.
5.7.1.1
Flyovers in open areas
Planning of flyovers
in open areas
is essentially guided by considerations of level
of service that
is expected along the designated corridor. The hierarchical pattern of
road network along with hierarchical classification of cross roads usually decides the
planning of flyovers in such areas.
Thus,
it may be desirable to have grade separated facility at an intersection between two
national highways or between a national highway and a state highway even though, the level
of congestion may not immediately indicate the need for such a facility. This is because of
the operational attributes that are associated with traffic operation along national highways.
By definition, an expressway is expected to have only grade separated intersections
and as such, provision of such treatments along an expressway becomes an integral
part of even the preliminary planning process. However, since detailed planning of such
facilities will have to be related to the desired level of service along such corridors
it
becomes necessary to study, in detail, the present and expected future characteristics
at such intersections.
By their location
attributes,
intersections
in open areas usually cater largely to long
haul through and intercity traffic that may not show any distinct and repetitive peaking
characteristics. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of the design year traffic volumes,
traffic sui'veys must be conducted at such locations for 24 hours over seven consecutive
days. The survey should be designed in such a manner that category wise traffic counts
and
turning
characteristics
of
traffic
at
intersections
are
adequately
covered. The
average of seven days of traffic volumes will give the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) that
has to be subsequently corrected for seasonal variations with the help of data available
for different seasons from permanent count stations maintained by the state PWD.
Even
if such permanent count station data are not available for the intersection under
consideration, a well judged estimate of the same could be made from data available
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
for nearby count stations that might experience similar fluctuations
in
traffic volumes
as would be expected
at the intersection under study. Also, monthly fuel rates data
collected from the outlets of nearby areas can be used for arriving at correction factors
separately.
In case, Average Annual
Daily Traffic (AADT) calculated over 365 days a year
is
available for the base year such data would also be made use of
in the planning
process. The ADT or the AADT must however, be available with an hourly split up of
traffic volumes.
For an
existing
intersection,
data on
intersection
delays must be
collected. This
information becomes necessary for establishing the viability of the scheme.
Design traffic volume could be defined as that hourly volume of traffic by the design
year for which the facility is to be planned. Usually, such a facility has a design
life of
20 years after construction and as such, design traffic volume will refer to the design
hourly
traffic volume
at the end
of the design
life. Determination of design
hourly
volume requires assessment of peak hourly traffic during the base year and projecting
the same to the design year.
There are several ways
of determining the peak hour
traffic volume
at the base
year for flyovers
in open areas.
In the even of AADT being available to 30th highest
hourly volume can be considered as the peak hourly volume of base year. Under
circumstances where this
is not available 12-14 percent of ADT could be taken as
the peak hourly volume.
In case, there is a distinct repetitive peak hour at a particular
location, such peak hourly volumes may also be considered for further analysis.
Hourly traffic volumes are expressed
in terms of equivalent passenger car units. The
factors for equivalency for various categories of vehicles are given
in Table
1. The
base year peak hourly volume
is to be projected to the design year with the help of
"
growth factors that may be determined on the basis of trend analysis
(if time series
data are available), economic growth factors of the hinter land, growth factors related
to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or at a compound rate of 7.5 percent per annum
(in absence of any other information).
The concept of level of service relates traffic volume levels to levels of efficiency of
traffic operation under specified physical and other boundary conditions.
In planning
a high type
facility
like flyovers
etc.
it
is important that the
level
of service of the
proposed facility be defined before hand so that the design service volume is logically
established. Design service volume at a particular level of service
is that maximum
volume of traffic which can be serviced by a facility at the design speed corresponding
to the defined level of service.
It must be understood that design service volume will
17



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
be different under different levels of service conditions. In order words, design service
volume under a particular level of service indicates capacity of the facility at that level
of service. The cross-sectional requirements like number of lanes etc., could be easily
determined by dividing the design hourly volume by the design service volume.
5.7.1.2
Flyovers in urban areas (urban flyovers)
Planning of urban flyovers
is generally guided by considerations of safety, efficiency
and economy of
traffic operation across major intersections along
important road
corridors. Unlike flyovers
in open areas, planning of such facilities
in urban areas
is
very frequently guided by space constraints, constraints of underground and over head
services, environmental considerations, aesthetics and urban design norms. One has
to also keep in view the city and its corridor layout pattern while planning a flyover in an
urban area. Intersections are usually fairly closely spaced in a city and while planning
a flyover at an
intersection,' the impact of the
facility on the adjoining intersections
must also be suitably assessed. While hierarchical pattern of road network remains an
important factor in planning urban flyovers, the traffic characteristics at the intersection
remain the most important decisive factor to this effect. Traffic studies thus become a
key activity in the context of planning of flyovers in urban areas.
Traffic facilities
in urban areas are usually planned for catering to peak hour traffic
demands.
It is thus very important to identify the peak hour and the peak hour traffic
characteristics at such urban intersections.
The decision to provide a flyover shall be based on examination of different alternatives
and
only after
all other avenues of efficient management of traffic through grade
treatments are exhausted.
It must also be remembered that an urban flyover would
generally serve the fast traffic (including buses) and thus, composition of traffic at
such locations must also be carefully studied and evaluated.
Traffic volume surveys
for intersections
in urban areas should be
carried
out for
24 hours on an average working day at 15 minutes interval so as to elicit information
on hourly traffic volumes including the morning, mid day and evening peak hour traffic
volumes. This should also
clearly bring out the turning characteristics of traffic at
the intersection and the composition of traffic.
In case, there are other intersections
within the close vicinity of the intersection under study,
it would be a good idea to
carry out traffic survey at such locations as well. The peak hour traffic volumes will be
ultimately expressed in terms of equivalent passenger car units with the help of factors
of equivalency.
,
Speed and delay survey are considered very important towards justifying provision
of flyover at an urban intersection. The data to be collected under this would relate to
18



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
signal cycle time
(if the intersection
is signalized), average delay at the intersection
and average stream speed over the influence area.
Other information to be collected in connection with design of flyovers in urban areas
would include information on bus routes and locations of bus stops, hourly volumes
of pedestrians crossing the intersection approach arms (at least for 12 hours on an
average working day), overhead and underground services and development plans,
if
any, for the adjacent quadrants.
As in the case of flyovers in open areas, the design traffic volumes for urban intersections
will be the projected peak hourly volume at the end of the design
life of the facility
(20 years after the construction of the flyover). Determination of design peak hourly
volume requires assessment of peak hour traffic during the base year and projecting
the same in the design year.
The base year peak hour
traffic volume
in
this case
is determined through
traffic
surveys. However, projecting the traffic to the design peak hour volume
is a complex
process and has to be attempted following several methods of projection. For such
purposes the master plan of the city and
its perspective development plan must be
referred to
in order to find out the expected pace of urban development within the
design
life of the facility. Traffic generation norms as adopted in the master plan could
then be applied to find out the additional traffic demand that would be generated at the
intersection under consideration during its design life.
It is possible that in certain cases
only projected person trips would be available. In such instances person trips will have
to be rationalized
in terms of equivalent passenger car units through application of
modal split.
In certain cities growth factors for peak hour traffic in terms of PCU have
already been established.
In such cases determination of design peak hour volume
becomes considerably easy.
Unless otherwise specified, a properly designed four arm intersection controlled by a traffic
rotary (with six lane approaches) could be assumed to have maximum capacity of 5000
PCU during the peak hour. A similar intersection controlled by automatic traffic signals
could have a maximum peak hour capacity upto 7500 PCU. Intersection traffic volumes
nearing 10,000 PCU usually result in very inefficient and hazardous traffic conditions and
it is at this level of traffic that provision of flyovers generally becomes necessary.
Traffic Surveys are thus necessary to establish
quantitative
information on
traffic
characteristics in terms ofoverall traffic volume, composition of traffic, hourly distribution,
vehicle occupancy, average speed on road network and delay at junctions, origins and
destination of trips
etc. and road characteristics
in terms of width of carriage-way,
available right of way, number of traffic lanes, parking, location of traffic signs, bus
stops and lamp poles, width of footpaths, encroachment etc. Analysis of traffic survey
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 92
======================================================================
\
IRC:SP:90-2010
data provides valuable inputs for economic and financial analysis of grade separators
and thus provides the basis for the justification of grade separators.
If a long section of road is intended to be developed as a fast corridor and even
if few
junctions of this corridor do not qualify for grade separator on account of minimum
PCU,
in such a situation the minimum PCU requirement may not come in the way of
extending/constructing the flyover over these intersections.
5.8
Level of Service (LOS)
5.8.1
Level of Service
is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions
within a traffic stream and their perception by drivers/passengers.
5.8.2
Level
of Service
definition
generally describes these conditions
in terms
of factors such as speed and travel time, freedom to manoeuver,
traffic interruptions,
comfort,
convenience and
safety.
Six
levels
of service
are
recognized commonly,
designated from A to F, with Level of Service A representing the best operating condition
(i.e. free flow) and Level of Service F the worst
(i.e. forced or break-down flow). On
urban roads, the Level of Service
is affected strongly by factors like the heterogeneity
of traffic speed regulations, frequency of intersections, presence of bus stops, on street
parking, roadside commercial activities, pedestrian volumes etc. This renders the Level
of Service concept for urban roads somewhat different than the rural roads.
5.8.3
Capacity standards are fixed normally
in
relation to the Level of Service
(LOS) adopted for the design.
5.9
Alignment and Layout
The alignment and lay out of a grade separator is usually determined by the alignments
of the intersecting roads ortraffic, plan area available and
all the geometrical standards
and other local restraints or site conditions.
However,
wherever
possible,
the
alignment and
layout should
avoid
passing
or
covering congested areas or locations with too much of above and under ground
utilities services or where meeting out the requirements of the geometrical standards
and other requirements of this manual
is not possible.
Alignment and
layout
should
be
fixed
taking maximum
advantage
of
the
local
topographical
conditions and contours such
that proper landscaping, smooth and
pleasing elevation of the structures, openness, drainage and easy flow of traffic
is
possible giving pleasing aesthetical and environmental friendly effects.

5.10
Geometric Configuration
5.10.1
The type of grade separation and interchange, along with
its design,
is
influenced by many factors, such as highway classification, character and composition
of traffic, design speed and degree of access
control. These controls plus design
requirements, economics, terrain and right-of-way are of great importance in planning
these
facilities with adequate capacity to safely accommodate the traffic demands.
5.10.2
Simple grade separators are provided when the high volume
traffic is to be
segregated by the elevated structure
. The rest of the traffic
still passes at the level
roads.
5.10.3
Interchanges, one level or multi level, are provided when several directional
traffic
is to be segregated from one another and all traffic is to be made signal free.
5. 10.3. 1
The ability to accommodate high volumes of traffic safely and efficiently through
intersections depends largely on what arrangement is provided for handling intersecting
traffic. The greatest efficiency, safety and capacity are attained when the intersecting
through traffic lanes are separated in grades. An interchange is a system of interconnecting
roadways in conjunction with one or more roadways or highways on different levels.
5.10.3.2
An interchange
is a useful and an adaptable solution for many intersection
problems, but because of the high
initial cost,
its use to eliminate existing conditions is
limited to those cases where the required expenditure can be justified. An enumeration
of the specific conditions or requirements justifying an interchange at a given intersection
is difficult and
in some instances cannot be conclusively stated. Because of the wide
variety of site conditions,
traffic volumes, highway types and interchange layouts, the
requirements
that justify an interchange may differ at each location. All the conditions
should be considered to reach a rational decision
at any location.
5.10.3.3
Each interchange
site should be studied and alternate designs made to
determine the most fitting arrangement of structures and ramps and accommodation
of bicycle and pedestrian traffic through the interchange area. Interchanges vary from
single ramps connecting local streets to complex and comprehensive layouts involving
two or more highways.
5.10.4
Justification for interchanges
'
Interchanges,
in general, are expensive to construct and a major factor influencing
the cost
is the type
of arrangement made
for the various
traffic movement. The
arrangement may range from separating only one traffic movement from other to the
complete separation of each traffic movement from every other movement, so that only
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 92
======================================================================
IRG:SP:90-2010
merging and diverging movements remain.
Similarly, the vehicle operating cost will
vary depending on the type of ramp arrangement, from direct conflict-free connections
to indirect connections involving extra travel distance. As interchanges are custom
designed to suit the prevailing conditions,
it will be necessary to carry out cost benefit
study taking
into account the total transportation cost,
i.e. the cost of construction,
maintenance and vehicle operation, to evaluate the techno-economic merits of the
individual cases before a final decision is taken. However, the following points may be
helpful in guiding the choice of an interchange at the preliminary planning stage:
i)
Interchange
will be necessary at
all crossings of a highway which
is
to be developed to completely access controlled standard.
Similarly,
interchanges
will
be
required
at
all
major crossings on
highways
developed to expressway standards.
ii)
An interchange may be justified at the crossing of a major arterial road
with another road of similar category carrying heavy traffic.
iii)
An interchange may be justified when an
at grade intersection
fails
to handle the volume
of
traffic
resulting
in
serious congestion and
frequent choking of the inter-section. This situation may arise when
the
total
traffic
of
all
the arms
of the
intersection
is
in excess
of
10,000 PCU's per hour.
iv)
High and
disproportionate
rate
of
fatal and
major accidents
at an
interaction not found to respond to other traffic control or improvement
measure may warrant an interchange.
v)
In some situations, the topography
is such that interchanges are the
only type that can be constructed economically.
vi)
The requirement of interchange may also be justified from the existing
constraints of the junctions other than traffic volume like parking, market,
important and religious structures, buildings
with frequent crowding.
vii)
While planning interchange at a particular location the traffic requirements
of the entire road on both sides should be taken into account.
5.10.5
Types of ramps
Interchanges are generally described by the pattern of the various turning roadways
or ramps and loops which determine their geometric configuration. The ramps can be
broadly classified into basic types, as described below:
i)
Left turning roadway referred to as diagonal ramp or outer connection
depending on
its shape or type of interchange.
The direct ramp does not form a part of the trumpet interchange.
22

IRC:SP:90-2010
ii)
A loop which
is a ramp for right turns accomplished by a
left exit and
turn to the left through about 270 degree.
Ill)
Semi direct connection which
is a ramp for right turns accomplished
through a partial deviation from the intended path.
iv)
Direct connection which
is a ramp for right turns accomplished by a
right
directional and
natural manoeuver involving
least extra
travel
distance.
5.10.6
Geometric configurations (common type)
The common geometricconfigurations of interchangesare the trumpet, diamond, cloverleaf,
rotary and directional
. Within each type of interchange, there can be several variations
such as split diamond, partial cloverleaf etc. depending on the ramp arrangements. The
salient operational conditions for each of these interchanges are given below:
5.10.6.1
Trumpet intercfiange
A trumpet interchange
is a 3-leg interchange. This
is the simplest interchange form
adaptable
to
"T" or "V"
intersections. Of the two
right turning movements, one
is
negotiated by a loop while the other is by a semi-direct connection. Diagonal ramps
are provided for left turning movements. Several variations of the design are possible
depending on the type of connection provided. The type of connection provided for the
right turning movements should be based on traffic volumes. The ramps catering to
heavy traffic volumes should preferably be provided with direct connections.
5.10.6.2
Diamond interchange
Atypical diamond interchange is the simplest of 4-leg interchange designs and is particularly
adaptable for major-minor highway intersections. The ramps which provide for one way
movement are usually elongated along the major highway and may be curved or parallel to
the major highway. The ramp terminals on the minor road are at grade intersections providing
for right and
left turning movements. Those at grade intersections may be controlled by
signals
if warranted by traffic volumes or in the absence of adequate sight distance.
5.10.6.3
Cloverleaf intercfiange
The design
of a typical cloverleaf interchange consists of one loop ramp for right
turning traffic and one outer connection for left turning traffic in each quadrant. Vehicles
desiring to turn right are required to turn left through about 270 degrees before attaining
the desired direction.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
5.10.6.4
Rotaty interchange
These are usually
4-leg interchanges. There can be variations depending on
traffic
requirement, site conditions, etc. This type of design is particularly useful where a number
of roads intersect at the interchange and in locations where sufficient land
is available.
It requires the construction of two bridges and generally necessitates more land than
for a diamond layout. The main highway goes over or under the rotary intersection and
turning movements are accommodated by the diagonal ramps.
The capacity of a rotary interchange
is similar to that of at-grade rotary. High speed
operations cannot be maintained on the minor road because of the
usually short
weaving distances.
It can, however, operate satisfactorily at low speeds. Also this type
of design entails only a
little additional travel distance for interchanging traffic which is
a significant advantage when slow moving traffic is present.
5. 10.6.5
Directional interchange
Directional interchanges have ramps for right turning traffic which follow the natural
direction of movement. This type of design requires more than one structure, or a
3-levei
structure. Though
operationally more
efficient
than
other
designs,
these
generally turn out to be very expensive.

Desirable normal & acceptable standard
Planning of grade separators and elevated structures in urban areas requires special
consideration for fitting them within the constraints of the urban scenario. Very often
Right-Of-Way (ROW) is restricted in a developed urban situation; both in the horizontal
and
vertical direction on both sides of ROW
leading
to curves which are beyond
acceptable criteria of design codes. The vertical profiles are constrained due to the
presence of traffic junctions very closely spaced to one another leading to gradients
steeper than those permitted by prevalent design codes.
In such
situations,
especially
in urban areas with sanctioned development
plans,
specific conditions may be required for the various geometric parameters and are
summarized as being "Desirable", "Normal" and "Acceptable"
Desirable
- which
in
the
normal
course must be executed on any
part
of the
.
structures.
Normal
- which is less than desirable parameter and which can be used in case
it
is not possible to achieve desirable parameter.
Acceptable
- which
can
be
used
in
exceptional
circumstances
for which
competent authority's approval may be sought.
Where an ideal situation exists, the target should be to achieve desirable parameter.
However
if
it is not possible, then
it should be permissible to adopt normal parameter.
But in urban areas, in a few cases as an exception,
it might be necessary to allow further
relaxations on acceptable standards. This has been classified under acceptable norms.
It
is suggested that whenever the "acceptable norms" need to be used, the Engineer
will record the reasons for adopting these standards. (Whenever junctions are closely
spaced and the junctions are on narrow roads and therefore cannot allow
tall truck
traffic or bus
traffic,
it can be considered to reduce the
clearance at these junctions
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 92
======================================================================
I
IRC:SP:90-2010
after analyzing
all the relevant factors. Any vehicle requiring more than
this vertical
clearance can go to next ideal junction where higher clearance
is available. Normally,
in the pedestrian subway 2.75 meters clearance is desirable from the consideration of
head loads to be carried comfortably. Most of the subways are at locations where head
loads are not earned. For higher vertical clearance more effort would be required to
climb up at the time of exit from the subway.
It also leads to serious problem of light and
ventilation. Here, reduced vertical clearance of 2.25 meters may have to be adopted.
While considering the acceptable limits,
it should be carefully examined and ensured
that this will not in any manner affect the proper functioning, serviceability and safety
of the interchange. This should not create any possibilities for obstruction to smooth
flow of traffic and causing traffic jams.
Geometric standards and other requirements can be fixed as per the recommendations
in IRC:86 "Geometric Design Standards for Urban Roads
in Plains" for rural areas.
!RC:73 "Geometric Design Standards for Rural (Non-Urban) Highways"
can also be
referred.

Collection of Data and Study of Utility Services, Structures and Trees
Failing in Project Area
5.11.1
Study and mapping of utility services, structures and encroacliments and
trees
The study and mapping
of
all the overhead and underground
utility services
e.g.
telephone cables, water supply and sewerage pipes, gas pipes etc. or structures,
encroachments falling in the project area is very important step in the planning, design,
construction and maintenance of grade separators.
The knowledge
of the
nature,
correct
location,
alignment,
size,
depth
or
height
and the importance of the service
is essential so that the requirements of
shifting,
relocation or its effect on design and construction are assessed and adequate steps
taken to make the area encumbrance or obstruction free before the commencement
of construction, so that the work
is not interrupted again and again on this account
causing uncontrollable delays and lots of inconvenience and discomfort to the traffic
in that area.
The data about
all
this has
to be
collected from
the
records
of the concerned
organizations or agencies and by doing survey and investigations at site.

5.11 .2
Plan, program and cost estimate for removal, shifting or relocation of utility
services, structures and removal of encroachments and cutting of trees
A detailed plan of these existing services and structures should be made and then
removal, shifting or relocation
plan and program concerning
all the departments be
made separately in consultation with them.
Further requirement of utilities may also be projected in the plan.
Similarly, Plan and program for removal of encroachment be made and cost assessed.
The number of trees falling
in the project area which
will be required to be cut should
be counted and the plan to cut
or transplant them
is to
be prepared and necessary
permissions should be taken in time. The work, many times, suffers badly on this account
as the clearances required from Forest Department and Govt, of India take lot of time. The
effort should, however be made to remove as minimum number of trees as possible.
As
many
Government
organizations
and
other
agencies
are
responsible
for
the running
and maintenance of the
different
utility services
or structures,
lot of
co-ordination work and efforts are required
in making and implementing this shifting
or relocation plan.
This also involves the expenditure incurred on this activity which is to be paid to them
and provision has to be made in the cost estimate of the project. Many a times, various
organizations make the estimates for this cost, as related to them, which has got to be
sanctioned as per their prescribed procedure.
All this and actual shifting, removal or relocation takes very long time and constant
pursuance is required. Proper provision of the time required for this work must be kept
in mind while setting out the time for completion of construction.
5.11.3
Utility planning manager/coordinator
Considering
the
importance
of the
activity
of
removal,
shifting/relocation
of
the underground and above ground
utility services and structures falling
in the
project area,
it is appropriate that one person on the project is made responsible
for making the adequate studies and prepare the plan and program along with
the assessment of costs involved and coordinate and monitor the progress of its
implementation. He may be designated separately as
Utility Planning Manager
or Coordinator.
5.11 .4
Phasing out this activity
It
is also appropriate that the work of these
utilities
shifting
etc.
is got carried out
separately before taking the construction of the grade separator so that the uncertainty
28



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
on this account is removed and there is no adverse effect on the progress of the project
as per the work program.
5.11 .5
Restrictions and limitations in planning, design and construction
Many a times,
it is not possible to remove, shift or relocate any services, encroachments
or structures falling in the project area for various reasons. Such situations should be
identified at the time of the above studies and a note about the same.be sent to the
Designer/Contractor so that its effect is adequately considered and provided for in the
layout, design and methodology of construction at the initial stage itself.
Sometimes,
various
old, abandoned,
buried
or unused
underground
services
or
structures are not located from the records or site surveys and investigations and their
existence is known at the time of actual construction operations of the foundations. In
such cases also,
its effect is to be considered by the designer and the layout, design
and construction techniques are accordingly modified or revised.
5.12
Plan and Program of Acquisition of Land and Structures
It
is
usually
not
possible
to
plan
a grade separating
facility,
especially
in urban
situations, within the land available
in ROW limits of the concerned department. As
such, assessment of land to be acquired and estimation of costs has to be made as
per the final layout of the grade separator. The acquisition of land will also include the
land required for making the diversion roads,
if any.
The detailed plan of acquisition of the land and the structures has to be made and
cost of acquisition worked out to be added to the cost of the project. The necessary
procedure to acquire the land should be initiated well in advance so that the project is
,
not delayed on this account.
5.13
Services Afiowed to be Carried on the Elevated Superstructures
Wherever required, the structure of the bridge shall cater for traction wire supports,
poles or pillars for lights, trenches or other suitable ducts for electric supply. Grade
Separators are normally not expected to carry other utilities. However, in urban areas
and particularly those involving crossing of railway lines (ROBs) other services and
utilities such as telephone/power lines, water mains and gas line may need to be carried
on the bridge structure. While planning, attention should be paid to their arrangement,
location, accessibility and prevention of structural damage to the bridge.
29



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
It is recommended that water or gas mains should be supported on brackets projecting
from the main structure whereby damage,
if any, is limited to the bracket and does not
spread to the bridge structure.
It is necessary to provide access to various utilities which are required to be maintained
frequently.
5.14
Geotechnical Data
Geotechnical data is required for the design of foundation in the same manner as
it is
required for any bridge structure and as given in Clause 704 of IRC:78.
One bore log shall be done at the location of each and every foundation unit. The depth
of the bore shall be as per the provisions of 1RC:78 for different types of foundations.
Special geo-technical investigations will be done to decide the suitability and safety of
foundations in seismic conditions, wherever required.
In case of grade separators
in urban
situations, depths of the underground water
supply lines, sewer lines & even electrical lines or gas pipe lines or structures,
if any
met during
drilling, have also to be ascertained and shown
in the borehole charts
,
besides the depth of water table. This will be required to decide the exact location and
founding level of the foundations.
Sub-surface exploration
is done to determine the suitability or otherwise of the
soil
surrounding the foundation and soil parameters or rock characteristics for the design
of foundation, by in-situ testing or testing of samples/cores taken out of exploration.
The study and analysis of the sub-soil data
will be required for deciding the type of
foundations to be adopted.
The sub-surface exploration shall be planned in such a way that different types of soil
upto the desired depth and their profile for the full proposed length of the flyover can
be recorded. Other information such as mechanical and physical properties like grain-
size distribution,
sensitivity, existence of any deleterious material
in
soil or ground
water,
etc., are determined along with
soil parameters and rock characteristics. The
sub-surface exploration shall also throw light on porosity of rock and subsidence due
to mining, ground water level, artesian condition,
if any, likely sinking and driving effort,
likely constructional difficulties, etc.
Field investigations of sub-surface exploration have usually three phases:
1)

Preliminary Explorations
iii)
Detailed Explorations
Reconnaissance includes a review of available topographic and geological information,
aerial photographs and data photographs and data from previous investigations and
site examination.
Preliminary investigation
shall include the study of existing geological
information,
previous
site
reports,
geological
maps,
air
photos,
etc.
and
surface
geological
examination. For large and important structures the information may be supplemented
by geophysical methods.
In some cases, where no
previous
sub-strata data are
available, exploratory geophysical
investigation may need
to be supplemented by
resorting to a few bore-holes. These
will help to narrow down the number of sites
under consideration and also to locate the most desirable location for detailed sub-
surface investigation like bore or drill holes, sounding probes, etc.
The scope of detailed
investigation may be decided based on data obtained
after
preliminary investigation. Based on this, the flyover site, type of structure with span
arrangement and the location and type of foundations,
shall be tentatively decided.
Thereafter, the scope
of detailed
investigation
including the extent of exploration,
number of bore-holes, type of soundings, type of tests, number of tests, etc, shall be
decided so that adequate data considered to be necessary for the detailed design and
execution are obtained.
Soil
investigation
for foundations
shall contain a program
for boring and
retrieval
of samples. The field work shall consist of excavation,
drilling of bore-holes for the
purposes of collection of undisturbed and disturbed samples, standard penetration
tests, in~situ vane tests, static and dynamic cone penetration tests, other field tests, as
specified by the Engineer and preparation of bore-logs. Collection and preservation
for testing of disturbed and undisturbed samples from bore-holes, borrowpits,
etc.,
as specified by the Engineer shall from a
part of the above.
All
in-situ tests
shall
be supplemented by laboratory
investigations. Relevant Indian Standards such as
IS 1498, IS 1888, IS 1892, IS 2132, IS.2720, IS 4434 and IS 4968 and Appendix-I of
IRC:78 etc., shall be followed for guidance. The soundings by dynamic method shall
be carried out in bore-holes using a standard sampler as specified in IS 2131
Detailed sub-soil exploration for the embankments in approach limits of the interchange
should also be done for proper design of embankment and pavement to meet the
requirements as per IRC:75 "Guidelines for Design of High Embankments" and IRC:37
"Guidelines for Design of Flexible Pavements" (Second Revision).

5.16
Requirements of Aesthetics
The grade separators are very important structures and are integral part of the urban
areas. As such the structural forms, lines and finishes of these structures should be
pleasing and beautiful. The layouts and elevations should be planned such that these
effects are created and they look sleek and fitting into the surroundings rather than
looking imposing and ugly.
•
Bridge aesthetics Is as important and necessary for grade separators as for buildings.
This has, however, not been adequately recognized so far. Proper emphasis need to
be given to this aspect while planning this facility.
The dimensions
of various components be so
proportioned
that the design and
appearance looks balanced and streamlined.
Pre-cast facia panels
or special patterns may be used as part of superstructure to
give the desired effect,
if the original lines and shape fail to do so.
Landscaping
of the
entire area
with proper and
attractive
plantation may add
to
this aspect. Various surface finishes for each element may be used to enhance the
aesthetic appeal.
The concrete surfaces achieved after removal of shuttering should not be allowed
to be plastered
in any manner. To avoid bad surfaces use of only high quality
forms
should be allowed. Rubbing unevenness by carborandum stones may be done to
remove oil spots of forms & make the surface fresh & new.
A large number of special architectural textures and finishes using concrete and special
forms of shuttering are possible.
The surface finishes should be selected
in such a manner that there
is no possibility
of being marred by pasting of advertisements or slogan writing.
Sometimes, painting with suitable paints may be resorted to and the same should be
maintained periodically.
32



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
In moderate exposure conditions cement based paints or lime wash may be used.
In marine or other aggressive environments, special surface paints based on epoxy
or polyurethane formulations can be used to help
in reducing penetration of harmful
chlorides or travel of moisture from surface to inside.
The painting scheme should be aesthetically appealing.
The choice should
fall on simple patterns, or relief and use of colour scheme giving
effect of spaciousness.
The shape and forms of Railings or Posts and Pillars etc. should be matched with the
local architecture, motifs and reliefs.
Proper design of signages, illumination and road surface markings can also boost the
aesthetic effects.
In case of underpasses glazed or terra-cotta tiles can be used.
5.17
Traffic
Diversion and Regulation Plan
The traffic diversion and Regulation Plan during different construction stages should
be visualized and tentatively decided at the planning stage for the grade separator.
Many a times this not being done creates problem during construction as either the
space is not available or construction methodology adopted does not permit any traffic
on the possible diversions. This results in change in design or construction techniques
disrupting the progress.
The diversion routes should be so planned that the disturbance to traffic on that route
is minimum and for a limited period. The quality, specifications and the geometries for
the diversion roads be kept reasonably good to meet the requirement of traffic plying
there and of minimum maintenance.
The construction stages of different activities can many a times be so planned that
the roads
i.e, service roads etc which are to be constructed as part of the project are
phased and used
to suit the requirements of traffic diversion.
If the diversion
is planned on new land,
it may require
its temporary or permanent
acquisition
for which necessary
timely action
will have to be taken
and cost of
acquisition, will have to be added to the cost of the project.

5.18
PlanningforConstructionCorridorand Land Required for Construction
Activities
The requirements of construction space have to be identified so that
its availability
could be ensured.
This should consider the land and space required for creating a
construction corridor for different activities at different times,
in plan and elevation,
without causing disturbance or obstruction
to the
existing
traffic,
for making the
site office. Laboratory, storage and movement
of machine and material,
Batching
plants. Hot mix plants and Casting Yards etc. Though this may have to be done by the
construction agency but identification of the requirements and matching them with the
available space and land
is necessary at planning stage so that appropriate designs
and construction methodology are conceived.
5.19
Environmental Issues
This
is
also
an
important
aspect.
All
the
environmental
issues
related
to
the
implementation of the project should be studied and analysed so that the required
clearances may be obtained
in time and Enviornment Management and Mitigation
Plan could be made without causing problems to the project.
Many issues involved
in
this may be
critical on deciding the type and
location of
different plants,
in selection of materials and method of construction to avoid
air, soil
and water pollution and conservation of environment and saving of energy.
5.20
Pedestrian Facilities
Suitable and adequate pedestrian facilities
have to be provided at
all arms of the
grade separator to facilitate safe movement and passage of pedestrian traffic crossing
them.
If no facilities are provided they tend to cross the roads at these locations at any
place risking their safety and creating chaotic conditions for the vehicular traffic leading
into delays and serious accidents
. The volume of pedestrian traffic and the locations
where the facilities for crossing the roads are to be provided should be identified at the
planning and design stage.
The type of facility, whether a signal crossing, pedestrian subway or foot over bridge,
should be decided based on the functional requirements, traffic volume on the roads,
traffic volume of the pedestrians, feasibility of construction and aesthetics etc. IRC: 103
may be referred to for this purpose.

6 GENERAL FEATURES & GEOMETRIC STANDARDS
The objective of geometric design is to provide maximum efficiency in traffic operations
and maximum safety at reasonable cost.
General Features and Geometric Standards shall be based on IRC Codes.
6.1
Carriageway Width
i)
The carriageway width shall be provided as per the provisions of IRC
Codes for the traffic requirements as determined by traffic census and
studies.
ii)
The carriageway width
on the elevated structure shall be kept same
as on the approaching roads on either side and the widths shall not be
reduced abruptly under any circumstances.
iii)
The carriageway width on the connecting one way loops or curved
structures shall be not less than equal to 2- lanes.
iv)
Extra widths
shall be provided on curves as per the
relevant IRC
Codes.
v)
Suitable merging lanes shall be provided
in highway system, so that
traffic coming down or taking off from the main roads on to the elevated
structure do not cross the main traffic on the roads.
.;
6.2
Foot Path
For safety
of pedestrians,
separate
footpaths, where ever necessary,
should
be
provided alongside the carriageway or urban
streets. They should be provided on
either side of the road and should preferably be raised above the general carriageway
level. To attract full use by pedestrians, they should be properly surfaced or paved.
They should be sloped adequately to drain away the rain water. Cross falls within the
range of
1
in 40 to
1
in 30 are satisfactory.
The minimum width of footpath shall be 1.5 m. Those parts of the footpath immediately
adjoining buildings, fences, trees and other obstructions, which will not be available for
free movement of pedestrians should be disregarded while calculating widths required.
Following Table provides guidelines for design of footpaths:

Kerb
The
Kerb shall be provided on both sides of carriageway as per the details given
in
relevant IRC Code.
6.3.1
The kerb should be so designed
that
it would be safe
for vertical and
horizontal loads as specified under relevant clauses in IRC:6.
6.3.2
A safety kerb shall have the sanne outline as that of a roadway kerb except
that the top width shall not be less than 600 mm.
6.3.3
This normal 225 mm high kerb may not be adequate for all grade separators
in crowded areas. This may be reviewed as per the site requirements.
6.4
Railings, Parapet or Crash Barriers
6.4.1
Railings or parapets
shall be provided on
both sides of the
bridge
for
the
protection
of
traffic. Apart from
its
structural
strength
considerations
shall be
given primarily to the architectural features of the railing or parapet to obtain proper
proportioning of
its various elements to harmonise with the structure as a whole.
Consideration shall also be given to avoid, as far as is possible obstruction of the view
from the passing motor cars.
6.4.2
Crash barriers shall be provided for grade separators designed for high
speed vehicles particularly
in urban areas. Crash barrier of either steel or concrete
may be provided.
6.4.3
For RGBs across railway
lines, parapets
shall be
solid as per Railway
standards.

IRC:SP:90-2010
6.4.4
Railings
or parapets
shall have a minimum
height above the adjacent
roadway or footway safety kerb surface of 1 .1 metre less one half the horizontal width
of the top rail or top of the parapet.
,
,
6.4.5
Where a bridge carries cycle tracks located immediately next to bridge
railing or parapet, the height of the railing or parapet should be raised by 15 cm than
that required otherwise.
6.4.6
Where railing is provided by top and bottom
rail the clear distance from the
bottom
rail to the top of the kerb shall not exceed 150 mm unless the space
is filled
by vertical or inclined members, the clear distance between which
is not more than
150 mm. The space between the bottom
rail and the top
rail shall be filled by means
of vertical, horizontal or inclined members, the clear distance between which shall be
fixed with due regard to the safety of persons and animals using the structure.
6.4.7
The details and design of Railings and Crash Barriers etc. shall conform to
the requirements of IRC Standards.

Lamp Post
"
The height and spacing of the lamp post shall be decided to achieve the desired level
of illumination on the carriageway as determined by the provisions indicated
in the
Chapter 15 of these guidelines
6.6
Bearings and Expansion Joints
The type of bearings and expansion joints to be provided should be carefully decided
at the time of design, so that
it remains functional and
in place throughout the
life of
the structure, requiring minimum maintenance.
Improper selection of type of expansion joints and bearings results
in
its becoming
unserviceable soon causing problems to the traffic as well as to the structure.
To improve the riding quality of road, expansion/contraction joints should be kept to a
minimum.
.
.
,
6.7
Wearing Coat
The wearing coat shall be provided over the deck to resist traffic wear and to provide a
smooth riding surface. This can be either of cement concrete or bituminous. The type
of the wearing coat shall be decided at the time of design. MORT&H Specifications for
Road and Bridge Works may be referred to for details.

IRC:SP:90-2010
6.8
Guardrails/Protective Measures
To protect vehicles from accidental collisions with abutments or piers, guardrails of suitable
height should be provided. These should be of robust design to effectively resist uprooting
and loosening of the support in the event of a collision. The ends of the guard rails should
be turned away from the
line of approaching
traffic so as to deflect runaway vehicles
which may otherwise hit the structure.
It is also essential that guard rails are provided on
both sides of the central piers or columns. Where raised footpath forms part of the cross-
section on the abutment side, provision of guard rails is not considered necessary.
Any other form of a suitable robust protective measure may be adopted instead of the guard
rails. Protective measure, so provided, shall not be an integral part of the structure.
6.9
Drainage
Effective drainage
shall be ensured by providing drainage spouts connected with
horizontal and vertical pipe system such that the water from the structure does not fall
on the roads, does not stagnate over the roads or at entry and exit points of the grade
separators and
is discharged into the overall draining system devised for the project
area as per the provisions in Chapter 14 of these guidelines.
6.10
Design Speed
6.10.1
Design speed
is related to the function of a road. Keeping in view the type
of functions expected of each class of the urban road system, the design speeds given
in the following Table
are recommended for adoption:
Table
- Design Speeds
Classification
Design speed (Itm/hr)
Arterial
80
Sub-arterial
60
Collector street
50
Local street
30
6.10.2
A lower or higher value compared to that given above may be adopted
depending on the presence of physical
controls, roadside development and other
related factors.
6.10.3
A lower design speed may be adopted in the central business area or areas
with extremely heavy roadside development. On the other hand, in suburban areas, a
higher value may be more appropriate.

======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
6.1 0.4
For divided iiigiiways, running speeds of vehicles are in general higher and,
therefore, in such cases a higher value may be adopted.
It should, however, be kept in view that sudden change
in design speed along any
road should be avoided. Change where necessary, should be made in stages in steps
of 10 km/hr at a time.
6.11
Space Standards
6.11.1
The space standards, also commonly referred as land width or right-of-way,
recommended for the various categories of urban roads are given in the Table
below:
Table

6.11.2
Standards given
in the above Table are for ideal conditions. Where such
space is not available, the minimum space standards shall be:
a)
For separator for 4 lanes or more
:
a
Width of service read +5 m on either side of service road
b)
For separator for 2 lanes
Width of service road +3.8 m on either side of service road.
6.11.3
I RC:73 may be referred to for space standards in rural areas.
6.12
Camber
Camber shall be provided as per relevant IRC codes.
Camber on grade separator with high type bituminous surfacing or cement
concrete
surfacing should be
1 .7 to 2 percent.
6.13
Super-elevation
Super-elevation
shall be provided on a horizontal curvature in accordance with the
relevant IRC Codes.
39



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
6.13.1
The effect of super elevation on stresses
in the various members of the
structure
shall be taken into account in the design.
613.2
Super-elevation shall be limited to 7 percent. However, on urban sections
with frequent intersections,
it may be limited to 4 percent.
6.14
Gradient
The gradients
in the approaching viaducts or earth embankments shall usually
be limited
to as per the relevant provisions of IRC codes. However,
in situations
where sufficient space or length
is not available then the gradients may be locally
increased to meet the requirement after judiciously considering the type of traffic
using the facility. But in any case gradient greater than 3.5 percent should not be
provided.
6.15
Vertical Curves
If there
is a change of gradient on the bridge deck, suitable vertical curve shall be
introduced conforming to
I RC:SP:23 for small length structures.
6.16
Horizontal Curves
In general,
horizontal curves should consist of a
circular portion flanked by
spiral
transitions at both end. Design speed, super-elevation and coefficient of side friction
affect the design of circular curves. Length of transition curves is determined on the
basis of rate of change of centrifugal acceleration and super-elevation. For design of
horizontal curves,
I RC:38 may be referred to.
6.17
Widening at Curves
Wherever horizontal curves are provided in grade separators,
it is necessary to widen
the carriageway as per relevant codes. The structures having entry and exit ramps or
loops should be provided with adequate
length of acceleration/deceleration/merging
lanes to ensure free and safe flow of traffic and to avoid congestion near the mouth of
such ramps or loops resulting in traffic jams.
6.18
T-Junctions
Minimum radius of curvature at right angle T-junctions shall be 9 metres.

6.19.2
On undivided roads, intermediate sight distance which
is equal to twice
the stopping distance shall be provided where vehicles are permitted to cross the
centerline.
6.19.3
Headlight sight distance
On valley curves, the design must ensure that the roadway ahead is properly illuminated
during
night travel by vehicle headlights for a
sufficient length which enables the
vehicles to brake to a stop,
if necessary. This is known as the headlight sight distance
and is equal to the safe stopping distance. From safety considerations, valley curves
should be designed to provide for this visibility.
6.19.4
For designing valley curves, the following
criteria should be followed
to
ensure the headlight sight distance:
i)
height of headlight above the road surface is 0.75 m
ii)
the useful beam of headlight is one degree upwards from the
grade of the road; and
iii)
the height of object is nil.
6.20
Clearances at Elevated Structures
The minimum horizontal clearance shall be the clear width and the minimum vertical
clearance the clear height available for the passage of traffic.
6.20.1
The minimum horizontal and vertical clearances for single and multiple lane
bridges with vehicular traffic shall be given as per the provisions of IRC:5.
6.20.2
For footways and cycle tracks, a minimum vertical clearance of 2.25 m shall
be provided.

6.20.3
For a bridge constructed on a horizontal curve with super elevated road
surface, the horizontal clearance shall be increased on the side of the inner kerb by
an amount equal to 5 multiplied by the super-elevation
in m. The minimum vertical
clearance shall be measured
in meters from the super elevated level of the roadway.
Extra horizontal clearance required for the super-elevation will be over and above the
increase in width required on a curve.
6.21
Clearances at Underpass
The vertical and lateral clearances at underpass shall be provided in accordance with
the stipulations in IRC: 54.
.
„

,
6.21.1
Overall considerations
'
-
.
. '
6.21. 1. 1
Conscious effort must be made to create a sense of freedom for the drivers
traveling through the underpass. As far as possible, the underpass roadway should
conform to the natural lines of the highway at the approaches as regards alignment,
profile and cross-section. Road profile should not dip too sharply under the structure
as that will produce a considerably enhanced sense of restriction when compared with
a profile that proceeds smoothly through.
6.21.1.2
To
promote
a
feeling
of openness and
unrestrained
lateral
clearance,
structures with open-end spans are recommended. Where
it becomes necessary to
have structures with solid abutments, these abutments should be set as far back from the
roadway edge as possible. Since such structures involve higher costs these treatments
may be reserved for higher categories of roads, especially with divided carriageways.
6.21 1.3
Since widening of an existing underpass at a later stage involves considerable
construction and diversion problems
it
is recommended that the
initial construction
itself should take into consideration such future needs. This is particulariy applicable
to underpasses on important routes like National and State Highways which need to
be widened from single-lane to two-lane standards after a short period as also for high
density two-lane roads which are planned or earmarked for upgrading to a four-lane
divided cross-section in the near future.

6.21.2.1.2
If a footpath is provided at the underpass on a rural road, lateral clearance
in the underpass portion should be the width of the footpath plus one meter.
6.21.2.2
Divided carriageways
6.21.2.2.1
Lateral clearance on left side
When an underpass is built for a divided highway, side clearance of left side shall be
in accordance with the above provisions.
6.21.2.2.2
Lateral clearance on right side
In case piers or columns are provided centrally and the same are not protected by
kerbed median divider, the lateral clearance shall be 2.0 m preferably and
1 .5 m at the
minimum. Where the median divider is kerbed, the carriageway shall be widened by
0.5 m to offset kerb shyness and the lateral clearance be kept
1 .5 m (preferred) and
1.0 m at the minimum.
6.21.3
Lateral clearance on urban roads
6.21.3.1
Single carriageways
"-.
6.21.3.1.1 Usually roads in urban areas are bordered by kerbs on both sides.
If so,
these should be extended across the underpass. However, to offset the effect of kerb
shyness, the carriageway in the underpass area should be widened on both sides by
the side safety margin of 0.25 meter each side in the case of lower category urban
roads and 0.5 meter on each side in the case of higher category urban roads.
6.21.3.1.2
If a footpath does not form part of the cross-section of the urban road, the
minimum lateral clearance in addition to the side safety margin shall be increased to
0.5 meter for lower category urban roads and
1 meter for higher category roads.
6.21.3.1.3 Where a
raised footpath
is
provided,
it
will
not be necessary
to have
additional clearance beyond the width of the footpath.

IRC:SP:90-2010
6.213.2
Divided carriageways
6.21.3.2.1 Where the underpass serves a divided facility, the width of the carriageway
should
be
increased on
either
side
by
the
side
safety
margin.
6.21.3.2.2
Lateral clearance on the
left hand side should conform to provisions as
given earlier and right hand side lateral clearance to the face of any structure in the
central median over and above the side safety margin shall be at least
1 m in the case
of higher category urban roads and 0.5 m in the case of lower category urban roads.
A single span structure avoiding central columns or piers should be
preferred.
6.21 .4
Vertical clearance
Vertical clearance at underpasses for road traffic shall be at least 5 meter. However, in
urban areas, this should be increased to 5.50 meters. Allowance should also be made
for likely overlays on the lower roads/highways.
6.22
Clearances at ROBs
6.22.1
Vertical clearances
For grade separators over
rail
lines,
vertical
clearance
shall be kept as
per the
requirements of the concerned railway authorities after confirmation from them of the
governing rules for the same
. Minimum is 6.25 m above the rail level. This requirement
usually varies with the type of services by that line and also on account of the needs
of electrification of railways or dedicated freight lines etc.
6.22.2
Horizontal clearances
The horizontal clearances between abutments or piers shall also be determined
in
consultation
with
railway
authorities. As a guidance,
the
horizontal
clear distance
between abutments for broad gauge tracks crossing at right angle are as follows:
2 lines
11.0 m
4 lines
22.0 m
6 lines
33.0 m
8 lines
44.0 m
Railway authorities, however, may like to have more than minimum distance between
two lines for various reasons.

======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
If the crossing involves one single line, provision may have
to be made for second
or more lines,
in future. All these requirements, including future electrification system
shall be finalised in consultation with railway authorities.
^
6.23
High Tension Lines
;
Where the grade separators or other elevated structures are being crossed by High
Tension
lines, the requirements of minimum
vertical clearances below such
lines
should also be found out in consultation with the concerned authorities and
it should
be provided for in the design.
6.24
Design of Pedestrian facilities- Subways and Foot over Bridges
These shall be designed as per the relevant provisions of IRC codes. The foot over,
bridges may be designed for crowded footpath loading of 500 kg/m^as per IRC:6.
The clearances shall be as per IRC:5 or as indicated
in above clauses. The access
and exit to and from the subway and foot over bridge should be planned so as not to
encroach in any manner upon the foot paths alongside the road carriageway and not
obstruct the free flow of pedestrian traffic.
7 TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION AND STRUCTURAL FORMS
7.1
GENERAL
Depending upon the span length, space available, ease and speed of construction
required, other restraints of traffic movement and regulations, limitation of movement
of machinery and material and environmental issues and requirements, one of the
following methods may be used for construction of superstructure:
i)
Cast-in-Situ on staging
ii)
Pre-cast at site or in casting yard and then erected or launched
iii)
Segmental-Cast-in-situ or pre-cast
iv)
Push in or incremental launching
Either girders of one span length or short segments of full deck width constitute the
basic element of construction for the superstructure.
7.2
Structural Forms
The structural forms for the superstructure can be chosen from the following
for
arriving at the most befitting, convenient and economical solution or any other forms
45



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
suiting the conditions at the site:
Solid slabs - RCC or Pre-stressed
RCC Beam-slab arrangement, where the view from underside or elevation is not very
important.
Box type superstructure
Closely touching beams
^
Voided slab
Composite, Pre-cast Pre-stressed concrete beam or steel girders with RCC cast-in-
situ deck slab, construction
Pre-cast
Pre-stressed
girders
made
continuous
by
using
cast-in-situ
cross
diaphragm.
Integral structure such as rigid frame units
Extra dosed structures
Cable stayed structures
7.2.1
Structural form of superstructure should be so chosen, wherever possible,
that its depth is minimum which will reduce the length of the flyover.
7.2.2
The superstructure should, as far as possible, consist of continuous spans,
instead of simply supported ones. This helps in reducing its depth, improving the riding
quality and durability and also improves its aesthetic appearance.
7.2.3
RCC Slab upto 10-15 m span and Pre-stressed slab upto 20 m span
range can be used. Span range and economics of solid slabs can be enhanced by
choosing continuous spans and increasing their depths at supports by a profiled
soffit.
7.2.4
RCC Beam and Slab arrangement can be used up to 20-25 m spans. For
larger spans, Pre-stressed concrete girders or steel plate girders with RCC slab can
be used up to 35-40 m.
7.2.5
Continuous RCC voided slab can be provided
upto 20-25 m.
For span
from 25 to 35 m,
pre-stressed voided slabs may be used, wherever feasible and
economical.
7.2.6
Simple Box girders are quite efficient forms up to 60 m as simply supported
or continuous construction, but also have a wide range of application for longer spans
and particularly when segmental construction is used.
46



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
7.2.7
Box
girders,
in
general,
should
not be used
indiscriminately
in
flyover
structures, as they can look bulky and disproportionate for short spans.
7.2.8
Integral type structure are useful for medium or small span ranges. These
are maintenance free and give better riding quality as bearings & expansion joints are
not required.
7.2.9
An extra dosed bridge is more suited to longer spans
ie. 50-150 m than a
conventional girder bridge and be a good alternative where the site restraints require
bigger span without causing any obstruction to traffic.
7.2.10
Use of cable stayed deck instead of simple box girder will result in reduced
thickness of deck. This may be better solution than adopting simple box girder for the
obligatory spans of flyovers, usually about 40-60 m, because the greater depth of
box girder than those of other spans increases the formation level resulting
in longer
flyover, increased height of embankment and consequently increased cost.
7.2.11
The cable stayed
structures are
usually not feasible or economical
for
the grade separators but, sometimes can be preferred to give a better and efficient
construction methodology.
Two-spans with single pylon cable-stayed, may sometimes be constructed alongside
the freeway, then rotated about the pylon into
its final position spanning the freeway
without closing the road traffic. The second span which will act as a counter weight,
may be buried under
fill to make
it completely invisible in the finished structure.
7.3
Methods of Construction
7.3.1
Besides usual methods of casting on staging, erecting or launching, the
segmental construction
is more often used to facilitate smooth flow of traffic during
construction especially
in urban situations and for increased speed of construction.
Guidelines for segmental construction in IRC:SP:65 may be referred to.
7.3.2
Push launching
is, most of the time, not feasible or even necessary. This
method may be used,
if suitable,
in some complex situations and special conditions.
7.3.3
For Voided Slab construction, various types of void formers can be used.
Spirally wound sheet metal tubes, HOPE pipes which are superior in terms of water-
tightness as well as non-corrosive properties or other methods of void formation can
be tried with varying degrees of success. The use of expanded polystyrene which
47



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
overcomes the problem of making the void-forming material water-tight and has the
further advantage of being cut to shape and size at site by a simple hand-saw, can
also be used.
7.3.4
In this type of construction
it has also to be kept in mind that all void formers
will require secure fixing to prevent floatation during concreting. The floatation force can
be substantial - even more so when combined with the vibration during the compaction
of concrete. This fixing has to be planned properly. Fixing of the void former to the
reinforcement cage may not
be thought of as a solution, as reinforcement can float
with the void formers.
7.3.5
Pre-cast pretensioned girders or steel girders with RCC slab may be used,
wherever suitable.
7.4
Foundations
7.4.1
Following types of foundations are usually suitable for grade separators:
i)
Open Type Foundations
ii)
Pile Foundations
-
iii)
Raft Foundations
Raft foundations
Shallow well foundations are
also, sometimes, used as
substitute
of deep open
foundation where excavation of sub-soil
for the deep open foundation may not be
feasible and where sufficient space is available for sinking of wells.
7.4.2
The suitability of a particular type of foundation
is decided on the basis of
availability and depth of suitable bearing
strata,
feasibility of excavation, boring or
sinking efforts required for the foundations, settlement criterion and restraints because
of the space, obstructing utility services or adjoining
rail lines & properties etc.
7.4.3
Selection of proper type of foundation
is very crucial and important as
it
governs the cost and time of completion of the project
. Sufficient study, analysis and
cost comparison should be done to decide this parameter where alternative types are
possible and feasible so that both economy and speed are achieved.
7.4.4
It
is desirable to use same type of foundations for any one structure to
avoid dissimilar settlements which would lead to very inconvenient
profile of road,
poor riding quality and damage to the expansion joints.
7.4.5
In many of the
city grade separators,
the
existing
service
lines create
obstructions for the ideal location of a foundation. In such cases,
it becomes necessary
48



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
to device some special solutions which include use of eccentrically loaded foundations
or odd shapes,
if the obstructions are too
large,
it becomes necessary to put two
separate foundations on either side of service lines and put a cap over the same from
which the pier can start. This kind of foundation across service line is also achieved by
use of piling, where possible.
7.4.6
While adopting a particular type of foundation
it should be considered that
it will not create any problem during construction to the traffic or the adjoining areas.
As such,
it may be explored that the space is available for the heap of earth excavated
in open foundation or excavation could be done by machines & excavated material
be dumped in trucks & carried away immediately so that
it has not to be stored in the
traffic corridor which may cause constriction to traffic flow and that deep excavation,
if done, will not damage adjoining property.
7.4.7
Similarly, shallow foundations are also affected by vibration of traffic. Where
the foundation
is to be constructed in central width of road and the traffic goes on both
sides during construction or even later, the effect of vibration of the soil due to this traffic
may be the additional factor to be considered for deciding the type of foundation.
7.4.8
For casting of piles, sufficient space horizontally and vertically should be
available for moving the
rig, for installing and erecting the
rig and for operation of
boring at every foundation location. Enough space should also be available for testing
of piles for making platforms and for loading etc.
7.4.9
It should be explored whether driving or boring of pile will cause any adverse
effect on adjoining area, structures or services.
7.4.10
Short piles should be avoided as there is lot of wastage as heavy pile caps
are in any case required.
7.5
Substructure
7.5.1
The type of substructure that can be adopted will have constraints arising
out of width of the flyover, foundation problems arising out of location of underground
services,
if any, requirements of openness etc.
7.5.2
The geometrical shape
(along width
of flyover)
of the
pier
should be
suitable to enable its adaptation to variable heights where the height of piers is varying
as
in the approach
portion.
Vertical shape or some other geometric shape where
proportions look pleasing to the eye inspite of change in one dimension
(i.e. height)
may be adopted.

======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 92
======================================================================
1RC:SP:90-2010
7.5.3
Single circular or oval piers may be suitable where
least construction space
is to be occupied. They look lighter and less massive.
7.5.4
Piers can be shaped and treated
in many
attractive ways. The
vertical
grooves can be introduced to accentuate the height and break the impact of width and
horizontal grooves to emphasize the mass of piers and to attract attention. The mass
of the abutment can be used to form sculptural treatment.
7.5.5
Elimination of pier caps by providing bearings directly over columns or piers
is also useful in achieving the lightness and smooth transition between the substructure
and superstructure.
7.5.6
Continuous
wall
type
piers
are
usually
not
required
in case
of grade
separators and can be avoided as visual transparency of the substructure
is more
important
at these
locations
for
better
visibility
of
traffic and the requirements
of
aesthetics.
7.5.7
Row of columns should be avoided at the pier locations, as
it mars the view
and do not look good aesthetically.
7.5.8
Where feasible from the design considerations
and where only few large
diameter piles in one row have been used as foundations, the piles can be extended
above the ground up to pier cap level to eliminate heavy pile caps.
7.5.8
The abutments for the viaducts can be separated from the earth
fill by
providing a gap topped by a slab and earth being retained by reinforced earth wall.
The load bearing abutment can then be designed without earth pressure and heavy
sections may not be required.
8 DESIGN
Design of grade separators shall be carried out as per relevant IRC standards.
8.1
Materials of Construction & Specifications
8.1 .1
The material for the grade separators is generally concrete. But steel is also
a good option, many times, for superstructures and sometimes for pier and abutments
also.
8.1.2
Composite Steel construction is also in practice at suitable locations.
8.1.3
Brick or Stone Masonry is also used where appropriate.
50



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
8.1 .4
Different materials may be used in different components of grade separators
depending upon the appropriate use of local materials and availability of skills and
expertise available, ease and economics of construction within the time and cost
restraints and from the requirement of aesthetics.
,
,
8.1 .5
One of the considerations in selecting the type of material is that construction
should be possible without causing too much inconvenience to the existing traffic for
a long time.
8.1.6
Use of High Grade or High Performance Concrete can be made to make
the structure look slim and more durable.
8.1 .7
Use of anti-corrosive steel or steel with anti-corrosive coating can be made
in marine or corrosive environmental conditions.
8.1.8
All
the
materials
selected
for
construction
will
conform
to
relevant
IS Codes.
8.2
Loads
8.2.1
Loading standards shall be
in accordance with IRC:6 except for the loads
and part or full clauses, which are exclusively applicable to river bridges.
8.2.2
For grade separators of 2 lanes and above, live load categories as defined
in IRC:6 may be adopted.
8.2.3
Bumper to Bumper Traffic
In crowded towns, vehicles have to stop at traffic signals or on account of traffic jams.
In such cases vehicles may be standing bumper to bumper on grade separators. The
effect of this
loading should also be considered
in the design.
8.2.4
Only crash
barriers
of
steel
or concrete should be
provided
for grade
separators designed for use by high speed vehicles in urban areas just after the ends
of carriageway. Where footpaths are also provided, railings should be provided at the
ends. The loading and design criteria for crash barriers shall be as given in 1RC;6.
8.2.5
If the founding level is below the highest water table level, then the effect of
buoyancy through pore pressure may be limited to 15 percent. The structure shall be
designed for dry condition of foundation and also when water table
is at
its highest.
Appropriate safe bearing capacity shall be assessed for both conditions.
51



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 92
======================================================================
!RC:SP:90-2010
8.2.6
The foundations shall be designed to withstand the worst combination of
loads and forces evaluated in accordance with the provisions of Clauses 700 and 707
of IRC: 78. The foundations shall be taken to such depths that they are sufficient from
consideration of bearing capacity, settlement,
stability and suitability of strata at the
founding level and sufficient depth below
it.
8.2.7
The relief due to passive resistance of soil below
1 .5 m. of GL in front of the
abutment may be considered.
8.2.8
The part of the grade separators falling
in line of traffic will be designed for
collision loads and impact as per IRC:78 unless these have been protected against
such collision by some protective measures.
.
•
'
.
8.2.9
All the components shall be checked for different construction stages also
as per the construction methodology statement.
8.3
Minimum Dimensions
8.3.1
The minimum dimensions of various members or components shall follow
the provisions of relevant IRC Codes.
B.3.2
To permit inspections of the inside of the box girder the minimum overall
depth of the section may be kept to about 2.25 m,
if feasible.
8.4
Design for Continuity
8.4.1
The
continuity
of the superstructure may be achieved by
providing
full
continuity or continuity for live load only. This is achieved by providing superstructure
longitudinally continuous over intermediate supports on bearings.
8.4.2
In case of Pre-cast girders,
this
is achieved by casting
in-situ slab and
diaphragm on them after placing them in position.
8.4.3
The superstructure can be made continuous through deck slab also by two
type of arrangements, one by continuous separated deck slab in which the deck slab
is continued monolithically over the intermediate piers without continuing the
girders.
The other is tied deck continuity in which the deck slab
is hinged over the pier using
partly debonded dowelling.
8.4.4
The design
of Continuous girder be done using the guidelines given
in
IRC:SP:66.
52



======================================================================
PAGE 61 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
8.4.5
Rigid frames are designed for settlement of 10 mm.
8.4.6
In case of grade separator the width to span ratio
is quite small, the effect
of these wider decks on the dispersion of the loads should be properly considered and
adequate provisions be made to ensure the structural response as per the design.
8.5
Foundations
8.5.1
The impact load from erring vehicle
hitting against a
pier,
if no separate
provisions have been made to avoid such impact,
will be included
in the loads and
load combinations.
8.5.2
If an
event
is foreseen where
it may become necessary
to
carry
out
excavations near the foundations of grade separators during the service
life of the
structure, in order to repair, replace or laying new services lines
it would be preferable
to take account of
the extra unsupported height of about 2 m. depth for substructure
and foundation designs. Service lines
laid
at grater depths
will have to be studied
separately on case by case basis.
8.6
Sub-Structure
8.6.1
The design of substructure will not require use of stream-line shapes.
8.6.2
f
Continuous wall type pier are not required, unless justified, for some reasons.
Visual transparency of the substructure design is more important for better visibility of
tfaffic and the requirements of aesthetics will assume primary importance.
8.7
Wearing Coat
8.7.1
Extra loads on account of
the increased
thickness of the wearing coat
because of repeated renewals etc. should be adequately considered in the design of
the superstructure.
8.8
Bearings
8.8.1
Possibility of lifting and resetting the bearings for alignment etc. should be
taken into consideration while designing the bearings.
8.8.2
Location
of bearings and the seismic restrainers,
if provided, should be
decided accurately at the time of design and the design of related components be
done accordingly.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
8.9
Expansion Joints
8 Jo1
Efforts should be made to provide minimum number of expansion joints.
8.9.2
The expansion joints provided should be very sturdy and fixed properly to
avoid their frequent repairs and dislodgement in a short time.
8.9.3
Only such
type should
be
preferred which
require minimum
care and
maintenance.
9 APPROACHES
9.1
The approaches on either end (excluding culvert) of any straight stilted portion
shall have minimum straight length of 15 m, except where a single vertical summit curve
has been provided as per the relevant clause
in Chapter 6 above, having a minimum
surfaced width equal to the roadway on the grade separator itself. This may be increased,
where necessary, to provide minimum sight distance for the design speed.
9.2
Where horizontal curves have to be provided on the approaches beyond the
straight portion on either side, the minimum radius of curvature, the super-elevation
and transition length for various speeds and curve radii shall be
in accordance with
relevant IRC Standards.
9.3
If there is a change of gradient, suitable vertical curves shall be introduced
conforming to IRC:SP:23.
9.4
Earthen Approaches
9.4.1
Earthen approaches may be
provided
at such
places where adequate
land width
is available for accommodating the
1:2 slopes of the embankments and
maintenance passages on both sides.
Incase there
is some marginal deficiency in the land width available
it may be made
good by providing toe wall & pitched slopes with slightly higher slopes.
9.4.2
In such cases,
it
is advisable to have at least one viaduct on each side of
main spans to provide for cross road traffic and one more for keeping of maintenance
materials.
9.4.3
If land width
is restricted, retaining walls or reinforced earth walls may be
provided on both sides.
54



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
9.5
Approaches in Urban Locations
9.5.1
In urban areas sufficient widtii is not available and wider roads & drains are
required on all sides. Earthen banks also require considerable quantity of earth which
has to be brought from long distance & the cost is also more. Considerable costly land
is occupied by the approaches.
Solid earthen embankments also obstruct the view
and do not look good. As such earthen approaches are usually not considered in such
locations.
9.5.2
Viaduct spans upto a height of 5.0 m can be provided so that
in the last
span a vertical clearance of 3 to 3.5 m
is available. This may be followed by the
earthen embankments or retained embankment either by retaining walls or reinforced
earth walls.
9.6
Utilization of Space below
If space below the viaduct is not used
in a planned manner this will remain unclean,
be misused and there would be encroachments.
9.6.1
If wide side roads are available
it is possible to provide godowns or shops
below, wherever feasible and required, ensuring safety of structure & proper movement
of traffic.
9.6.2
If enough wide side roads are not available, the space can be used
for parking of vehicles,
if required and feasible from the considerations of the
traffic flow.
9.6.3
The other
alternative
is to provide landscaping and
plantations so that
surroundings look clean and aesthetically beautiful.
9.7
Retaining Walls and Return Walls
9.7.1
The retaining walls should be usually simple cantilever type with correction
in front slope for the deflection.
9.7.2
Counterfort
retaining
walls
should
be
provided
only where
specifically
required and economical.
9.7.3
Splayed return walls should be avoided especially in case of urban situations.
9.8
Reinforced Soil Structures
9.8.1
The reinforced soil walls can be designed as per the provisions of latest IRC
codes or as per any International accepted practice.
55



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
9.8.2
Reinforced earth retaining walls constructed with soil backfill reinforced with
inextensible flexible reinforcement, such as metallic strips or sheets or extensible geo-
synthetic materials, such as; geo-textiles and geo-grid, are used for solid ramp portion
for approaches of flyovers, grade separators and or embankment.
It does not cover
load bearing abutments.
9.8.3
Selected
fill and filler material conforming to specifications given in relevant
IRC standards are used in the reinforced soil structure as back fill behind facia panels.
The material is granular and purely non-cohesive.
9.8.4
Geo-synthetic material may be woven, non-woven or knitted sheet used in
geo-technical engineering and other civil engineering applications that sustain design
loads at permissible strains and defined creep characteristic with maximum elongation
less than the permissible limit.
9.8.5
Metallic reinforcement is in the form of strip or rod or square welded mesh/
net which sustains load at strains less than or equal to the permissible value.
9.8.6
The facia panels should be cast with proper line and finish preferably in a
casting yard. They can be given different treatment with patterns to suit the aesthetical
requirements or giving any effect.
9.8.7
The
back
fill
material
should
be
properly compacted
in
the designed
thickness of layers, as per the specifications.
^
9.8.8
The facia panels should be erected to give uniform surfaces and fixed to the
reinforcing materials such that these are not dislodged.
9.8.9
The drainage
layer
of prescribed
specifications should be
provided as
required by design and specifications and
it should be ensured that
it
will remain
functional and will not be choked because of flow of silt particles in the backfill, during
the outflow of water, as
it may
result in the failure of embankment.
10 CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY, WORK PROGRAM
AND QUALITY CONTROL
10.1
The detailed construction methodology statement for each major activity and
overall project, should be prepared in advance of starting the construction, keeping in
mind the conformity to design, traffic regulation, ease, speed and safety of construction
and availability of space. This should give details of the specifications and number of
different equipments, plants, materials and likely period of each activity.
56



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
10.2
A CPM or activity/progress chart should then be prepared considering
all
activities, some of them being independent and others being
inter dependent. This
should be regularly updated as per actual progress or the effect of different impediments,
failures and mistakes or uncertainties. The activities falling on the critical path should
be monitored properly and necessary measures should be taken timely to make up for
slippages,
if any.
10.3
All the activities should be integrated
in the format of work program. This
should
indicate quantities and dates of start and completion
of each
activity. The
resources at site in terms of men, material and machines and plants should match the
requirements of the work program. Otherwise the work program should be recast with
the actual resources available at site.
10.4
The work program should be so phased out that minimum disturbance
is caused to
traffic at any time and diversion of traffic could be planned with
least
inconvenience to all concerned. The work should be planned
in shifts consistent with
traffic constraints so that the machines and materials could be moved to site during
lean traffic periods or at night.
10.5
The traffic diversion scheme should be
in place before starting the actual
construction work. This should be designed
for the
full expected
traffic loads and
constructed with same specifications and quality standards as the normal road. These
roads should be regularly inspected and maintained properly so that the smooth flow
of traffic is ensured.
.
10.6
Pre-cast construction techniques should be considered and used where
feasible for superstructure so as to ensure faster construction and better quality and
finish and to avoid the problems of lack of space during construction.
Where pre-cast construction is adopted, a suitably designed and laid out casting yard
will be constructed with adequate lifting, shifting and storing arrangements and curing,
preferably steam curing facilities.
10.7
The location of the casting yard shall be so chosen that enough space
is
available,
it
is near to project site and
it
is easy to transport the pre-cast units to the
site.
10.8
The size of the casting yard
will be decided according to the production
capacity and to suit the requirements of these units as per the construction schedule
and work program.
57



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
10.9
The
quality
standards
will
be
equivalent
to Q4
in
conformity
with
IRC:SP:47.
10.10
Quality Assurance and Control Plan shall be prepared for each project on
the basis of above document and the requirements at site and strictly followed during
construction.
11 DESIGN OF FALSEWORK AND TEMPORARY STRUCTURES
11.1
All the formwork, staging and temporary structures, launching or erection
systems should be properly designed taking
into considerations the design of the
structure, construction technology,
site conditions including traffic regulation, safety,
mobility, easy handling, line and finish required.
11.2
This should conform to the requirements of IRC:87.
11.3
All the design and detailing of the above should be checked and approved
by competent authority before its use at the site.
1 1 .4
Grade separators are important structures, mostly constructed in the vicinity
or inside cities and inhabited areas, the failure of either of these during construction
may cause serious problems and consequences including
fatal accidents, besides
disrupting the critical construction schedule.
11.5
The specially designed hydraulic operated steel moulds with surface lined with
special rubber having hardness 60-70 IRHD may be used, where suitable and feasible
.
11.6
Single shutters may be used for casting of pier etc. to give better finish and
for faster construction.
11.7
Considering the importance of these items, one member of the project team
should be earmarked as Temporary Structures Manager so that all the aspects may
be given proper and adequate attention.
12 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
There should be a Safety Plan/Manual drafted for each site considering all the
safety
requirements for men, machines and methods, provisions to be made, -precautions to
be taken and inspections and checks to be carried out.
The safety aspects may be looked after and managed by a dedicated officer earmarked
exclusively for this activity on a major project.
58



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
12.1
Safety Requirements to be considered in the Design
The design should consider safe geometries, turning radius and corresponding safe
limits for speed, super-elevations and cambers, extra widths on curves and merging
lanes or exit lanes etc.
Road side kerbs and railing or crash barriers properly designed and located, should
be provided,
Adequate road/lane marking signs/strips should be provided.
The provision for proper lighting of the grade separators,
its approaches and
all the
signages should be made and
special
lights, where
required
for safety or giving
additional effects, may be provided.
Adequate
provisions for prevention of impact/collision of vehicles should be made
in
the design.
12.2
Safety Requirements to be considered during Construction
Enough barricading should be done
in a clean and systematic manner to enclose
the work areas such that the traffic passing adjacent or
in the vicinity of the site
is
safe and do not face any problems and
the
construction
activities do not attract
undue attention of the traffic and cause any disturbance to
it. The entire construction
corridor should be adequately lighted at night and enough warning/diversion/direction
signs distinctly visible from distance during day and night, should be installed for safe
working conditions and for facilitating the traffic.
All the equipments, machines and plants, erection, lifting and launching arrangements
should be properly tested before use for performing the duties for which they would
be used during construction.
All the operating staff/drivers etc. handling any activity and the corresponding machinery
should be adequately briefed about the methodology and limitations of the operations
so that no arbitrary discretions are used by them which may lead to unsafe conditions
or failures or accidents.
It should be ensured that all the formwork, false work, temporary structures and other
systems have been properly designed as per IRC:87 and approved and they conform
to the site conditions.
Site office and the entire construction corridor should be properly planned and laid out
for proper running of vehicles and all other activities to avoid any chances of accidents
59



======================================================================

IRC:SP:90-2010
and site should be
maintained neat and clean of waste materials, scraps or spilled
oils, diesel or greasy
or any inflammatory materials.
All measures should be taken to avoid or mitigate air, water and soil pollution so that
there are no health or safety hazards.
The project site should have enough provisions of fire fighting, disaster management
and medical facilities to deal with any such situations satisfactorily.
13 SIGNAGE
13.1
Adequate and
proper signages should be
provided
at
all
suitable and
required locations before
and on the grade separated facilities to give direction and
guidance to the traffic for different routes or important places well in advance and in a
prominent and visible manner.
13.2
The signages may be provided as per the guidelines given in IRC:67.
13.3
Every grade separator should, preferably, be
given a name, linked to
its
location, especially in urban situations or when located in city limits and this should be
prominently displayed on the sign boards for all the directions of traffic, to facilitate the
users to identify easily the exact location of passage and are alerted timely to choose
the direction of destination.
13.4
The adequacy of the signage
is more important for multilevel or multi arm/
loop interchanges where
traffic flows
uninterruptedly
in
different directions. There
should be
a
bold and prominent sign board just before every entry or exit point and
in addition, a repeat sign board 50 m before them.
If not guided properly by these signages, the user may
have to take long detours or
diversions to return to the missed entry or exit points.
1 3.5
It has to be ensured that all the signages are distinguishably visible at night
from a reasonable distance by proper lighting.
13.6
Effectiveness of all the signages should be checked after these have been
placed in their places to see
if the traffic to all the destinations get timely direction and
guidance and no sign or direction is missed while driving on the grade separator during
day or night.
If any improper size, height, placement, illumination or any obstructions
to the driver's view is observed
it should be corrected.
60



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
13.7
No advertisements should
in any manner be allowed on these signages or
on any portion or around the grade separators, as
it may distract the attention of the
driver.
13.8
The design, shape and
size of the signages should be elegant and good
looking from the considerations of usefulness and aesthetics.
14 DRAINAGE OF ROADWAY
14.1
Effective drainage shall be provided both
longitudinally and transversely
particularly in heavy rainfall areas. The transverse drainage shall be secured by means
of suitable camber in the roadway surface. Longitudinal drainage shall be secured by
means of scuppers,
inlets, or other suitable means of sufficient size and numbers to
drain the run-off efficiently.
14.2
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of
1
No. per
12 sqm of the surface in level portions and
1 No. per 15 sqm of the surface area on
gradients. Water spouts are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum
100 mm) on either side of roadway and taken down by downtake pipes at pier &
abutment locations.
14.3
Drainage fixtures and downspouts,
if provided, shall be of rigid, corrosion
resistant material not less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided
with suitable cleanout fixtures.
14.4
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing
discharge of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions
of concrete floors shall be provided with drip moulds.
14.5
Catch water drains are necessary at the end of viaduct portion so that water
coming from span does not over saturate and affect the earthen embankment. Similar
catch water drains should be at the end of gradient so that water coming from flyover
is properly let out to nearest drain.
14.6
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures,
local catchment area of the project and
all other sources should be prepared so that
no water falls on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the
level roads. All the water
is collected through sumps and finally discharged into the
local drainage systems i.e., storm water pipes etc. either by gravity through connecting
drains or by pumping into the existing outgoing drains.

The
rainwater from
the decks
of the
structures
usually does
not flow
transversely but flows on the high gradient slopes of the roads or approaches and
is
collected
in the valley curve portion. As such attention
is to be paid to get this large
quantity of water drained out
fast without accumulating there causing problems for
traffic flow resulting in traffic jams. The draining out systems should be designed with
greater margins so as to avoid this problem, at least for grade separators inside the
cities or inhabited areas.

15.1.3
Types of illumination systems
i)
Normal street light
ii)
Single/double bracket street light poles
iii)
High mast lights
iv)
Combination of normal street light poles either with single luminaries
or
twin luminaries and a number of light mast lights with multi-uminaries
15.1.3.1
Illumination of ROBs and earth filled approaches
The
first two systems are usually sufficient for railway over bridges, on the
stilted
flyovers
as well as on
its earth filled approaches, rural or semi-urban structures and
generally for two lane elevated carriageways. Double bracket 250 W luminaries are
used preferably
in the Central Verge. Alternatively, single bracket lights
in one side
of the road/flyover may be provided with about 8 to 9 m high poles. The height of the
pole and
its distance including the angle and capacity of the luminaries should be so
designed to achieve an average illumination level of 30 lux with maintenance factor of
0.7 and average illumination factor of 0.4.
15.1.3.2
Illumination of a rural or semi-urban grade separator
These structures, generally
being two
lane, can be
illuminated with the
first two
systems.
Only at the junction of the grade separators with 4 or more lanes
stilts carriageways,
where lighting on the top level will create heavy shades/shadows or the lower level roads,
question of providing high mast lighting at the corners as per the system given later can be
considered. Perhaps only four high masts particularly in the four corners of the slip roads
may achieve the required level of illumination along with normal street light poles.
15.1.3.3
Illumination for urban grade separators
In this case,
the elevated road being
at least of 4 lane carriageway
i.e. 2 lanes
in
each directions, the width of the elevated road causes shadows/shades underneath
such carriageways. Further, presence of trumpets and clover leaves complicates the
problem.
In such cases, use of high mast lights (lights with the height of poles/masts
more than
1 0 m and maximum upto 50 m) with required no. of luminaries to be attached
on the head frame are essential. The total illumination system which will comprise of a
combination of normal street light poles either with single luminaries or twin luminaries
and a number of a
light mast lights with multi-luminaries, should be so designed to
achieve an illumination level, as given above, throughout the intersection.

15.1.3.4
Arrangement for beautification of the structure
Street light structures and luminaries are often used as an instrument for beautification
of the road.
It is however essential, considering the different intensities of head lights
of various types of vehicles in Indian roads that due attention is paid to the illumination
level on the carriage way.
15. 1.3.5
It is desirable to have the lighting circuit distributed in three phases, so that
even
if one phase goes off, a part of the lights will be in operation. Electro-mechanical
timers
be
provided
for
auto-switching
on
and
off
to
avoid
separate manpower
requirement particularly in out of the way places.

in any case not exceed three. The three sections should be fitted together on site in
a manner that does not require any BSEN 10025 welding. Rather, one unit should
be fitted telescopically into another with sufficient anchorage length to ensure that no
transverse welding of the joints are needed. Transverse welds will not be allowed
in
the body of the mast.
15.2.4
Steel conforming to BS

15.3
Energy Conservation
There is need to conserve electrical energy consumption, particularly during late night
hours or early morning hours when the traffic density is rather low. Special ballasts for
HPSV lamps have now been developed, which reduce the lighting levels and electrical
energy consumption after specified hours on each day. Use of such ballasts should be
preferred
in future installations.
15.4
Lighting Pollution
High mast lighting may cause lighting pollution, particularly in urban areas, where high
rise apartments or Airports are
in the vicinity. A fiber glass canopy suitably provided
over the lantern carriage will prevent spilling of light
in azimuth thus, reducing
light
pollution in the sky.
15.5
Example
A typical example of design for Illumination
is given below:
Class of pavement according to the CIE

distribution board
for
receiving the three phase power supplies from the public utility system and distributing
the same for the lighting is provided at an appropriate place. The distribution of power
supply is through insulated PVC armored cables of cross- section ranging from 16 mm
square to 2.5 mm square. An automatic on/off switching system based on the density
of natural light has been provided. This is a solid state control device, incorporating a
photoelectric cell for automatically switching the lighting system based on the intensity
of daylight. The device automatically switches on/off at preset lighting intensity. The
unit is adjustable from 0.2 Lux to 8 Lux. Apart from saving
in power, the system also

16 CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS AND PROCEDURES
16.1
Introduction
The problems faced during implementation of flyovers and other elevated structures
are of different nature and are required to be tackled at different stages of inception,
design and construction.
1 6.1 .1
The problem faced during construction are related to lack of attention to various
requirements of data collection, planning process and the investigations required.
16.1.2
The problems faced are mainly on account of:
i)
Non-availability
of encumbrance
free
project
site and
construction
corridor
ii)
Disruption of work because of encroachments, trees, land or structures
to be
acquired
or
obstructions due
to on
or under ground
utility
services
iii)
Lack of proper data and understanding of procedures for removal of
the encroachments, acquisition and removal, shifting or relocation of
utility services
iv)
Lack of coordination between the various organizations and agencies
involved and responsible for the above
v)
Lack of any realistic work program based on resources and restraints,
or when the
critical
activities are not identified and timely action not
taken to perform or complete them.
vi)
No proper phasing out of different activities keeping
in mind various
requirements and limitations at site.
vii)
Lack of proper sub-soil investigations resulting in inappropriate type of
founding systems etc.
viii) Selection of improper or inappropriate construction technology
ix)
Improper traffic data making traffic diversion and regulation difficult at
the time of construction

IRC:SP:90-2010
x)
Restricted working hours for some important activities which involve
movement of material and machinery
xi)
Non-availability of land for casting yard, storage of materials, setting up of
the batching plants etc. in nearby locality making handling more difficult
xii)
Strict
regulations
for
environmental
issues
imposing
too
many
restrictions and limitations for procedures and compliances.
xlii) Poor quality control and assurance measures or practices which may
result in redoing many activities
xiv)
Insufficient resources as per the work program
xv)
Insufficient
safety measures and
improper compliances
of various
regulations
which
lead
to
accidents
during
construction
causing
disruption of work
16.1.3
These
problems
can
be
completely
avoided
or
mitigated,
if
the
planning
is done with
full care and concern, addressing
all the issues as given
in
Chapter 5-Planning.
16.2
Pre-Construction Requirements
16.2.1
Project office should be established with proper lay out and space
with
demarcated
places
for
offices,
meeting
rooms.
Test
laboratories,
labour
sheds,
canteen, batching plants, hot mix plants, storage of materials pathways, roads etc.
in
such a manner that there is no congestion, obstruction or disturbance to any activities
because of the others.
The entire complex need to be kept neat and tidy without any stagnant water or waste
materials and so as not to create any air, water, soil or noise pollution.
16.2.2
Construction
methods
should
be
planned
adequately
to
cater
for
suitable regulation of traffic movement and traffic diversion and avoidance of public
inconvenience to a minimum.
1 6.2.3
Movement of machines and materials should be properly planned in advance
for smooth execution of work.
16.2.4
Planning for adequate availability of land either close to construction site
or away from
it, needs
to be adequately catered
for
installing concrete batching
plants, stone crushers, WMM Plants, HMM plant etc. as required for execution of the
project.

IRC:SP:90-2010
16.3
Environmental Measures
16.3.1
All precautions should be taken for safeguarding the environment during
the course of the construction of the works. All laws, rules and regulations
in force
governing pollution and environmental protection that are applicable in the area should
be followed where the works are situated.
16.3.2
Borrow-pits should be dug in conformity with MORT&H Specifications from
approved sources with preference given to materials becoming available from nearby
roadway excavation source.
There
shall
be
full
compliance
of environmental
requirements
in
respect
of excavation and borrow areas as stipulated by Ministry of
Environment and Forests and local bodies.
16.3.3
Materials from quarries should be obtained only after the consent of the
Forest Department or other concerned authorities
is obtained. The quarry operations
should be undertaken within the purview of the rules and regulations in force.
16.3.4
Bituminous Hot-Mix Plants and Concrete Batching Plants should be located
sufficiently away from habitation, agricultural operations or industrial establishments.
Precaution ought to be taken to reduce the levels of noise, vibration, dust and emissions
from the plant. Any materials, which are hazardous to the health of persons, animals
or vegetation, should not be used. Protective clothing and safety appliances to the
workers needs to be provided.
16.3.5
All reasonable steps need be taken to minimise dust nuisance during the
construction of the works. All noise pollution activities should be controlled adequately.
All existing highways and roads used by vehicles for suppliers of materials or plant,
and similarly any new roads which are part of the works and which are being used by
traffic, should be kept clean and clear of all
dust/mud.
Other extraneous materials
and debris etc. from the works spreading on these highways ought to be immediately
cleared
during execution
of works. Clearance has
to be
effected immediately by
manual sweeping or mechanical methods
. All dust, mud and other debris needs to be
removed entirely from the road surface regularly.
16.3.6
Any structural damage caused to the existing roads by the construction
equipment should be made good.
16.4
Traffic Arrangement During Construction
16.4.1
The work should be carried out on the highway in a manner creating least
interference to the flow of traffic while consistent with the satisfactory execution of
72



======================================================================

IRC:SP:90-2010
the same.
For
all works
involving improvements
at the existing
location
of grade
separator,
it
is necessary to provide and maintain, during execution of the work, a
passage for traffic either along a part of the existing carriageway, or along a temporary
diversion constructed close
by. Traffic arrangements scheme needs be worked out
and implemented as per prevalent traffic norms during construction.
16.4.2
Passage of traffic along the existing carriageway during construction of
grade separator
Widening/strengthening
of existing
location
of grade separator along carriageway,
where part width is proposed to be used for passage of traffic, should be done. Treated
shoulders should be provided on the side on which work
is not
in
progress. The
treatment to the shoulder should consist of providing at least 150 mm thick granular
base course covered with bituminous surface dressing in a width of at least
1 .5 m and
the surface should be maintained throughout the period during which traffic uses the
same.
16.4.2.1
The continuous length,
in which such work shall be carried out, would be
limited normally to 500 m at a place.
16.4.2.2
In case of widening of existing two-lane to four-lane to accommodate grade
separator, the additional two lanes would be constructed first and the traffic diverted
to
it prior to the required construction of grade separator.
16.4.3
Passage of traffic along a temporary diversion
16.4.3.1
In stretches where
it
is not possible to pass the traffic on part width of the
carriageway, a temporary diversion should be constructed with 7 m carriageway and
2.5 m earthen shoulders on each side (total width of roadway 12 m) with the following
provision for road crust in the 7 m widths:
i)
200 mm (compacted) granular sub-base;
ii)
225 mm (compacted) granular base-course: and
iii)
Premix carpet with Seal Coat/Mix seal surfacing.
16.4.3.2
The alignment and longitudinal section of diversion including junctions and
temporary cross drainage provision should be properly designed and implemented.
1 6.4.4
Traffic safety and control
16.4.4. 1
All necessary measures should be undertaken for ensuring satisfactory flow
of traffic during construction and provide, erect and maintain such barricades, including
73



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
signs, markings, flags, lights and flagmen as may be required for the information and
protection of traffic approaching or passing through the section of the highway under
improvement. Before taking up any construction, an agreed phased program for the
diversion of traffic on the highway shall be drawn up.
16.4.4.2
The barricades erected on
either side of the carriageway/portion of the
carriageway closed to traffic, should be of strong design to resist violation and painted
with alternate black and white stripes. Red lanterns or warning lights of similar type
should be mounted on the barricades at night and kept
lit throughout from sunset to
sunrise.
16.4.4.3
At the points where traffic
is to deviate from
its normal path (whether on
temporary diversion or part width of the carriageway) the channel for traffic shall be
clearly marked with the aid of pavement markings, painted drums or a similar device.
At night, the passage shall be delineated with lanterns or other suitable light source.
16.4.4.4
One-way traffic operation should be established whenever the traffic
is to
be passed over part of the carriageway inadequate for two-lane traffic. This should be
done with the help of temporary traffic signals or flagmen kept positioned on opposite
sides during
all hours. For regulation of traffic, the flagmen should be equipped with
red and green flags and lanterns/lights.
16.4.4.5
On both sides, suitable regulatory/warning signs should be installed for the
guidance of road users. On each approach, at least two signs shall be put up, one
close to the point where transition of carriageway begins and the other 120 m away.
The signs shall be of approved design and of reflector type as required.
16.4.4.6
Signs, lights, barriers and other traffic control devices, as well as the riding
surface of diversions should be maintained
in a satisfactory condition
till such time
they are required. Temporary travelled way should be kept free of dust by frequent
applications of water as necessary.
16.5
Shifting of Services
16.5.1
All
the
underground
and
overhead
services
and
structures
and
encroachments have to be removed or shifted, and
traffic diversions have to be
managed before the construction can
start.
Usually
this takes unduly long time.
Because of the uncertainty of the time required for this activity, work program cannot
be implemented and there are long delays and time overrun. This leads to
idling
of labour and machines and increase
in overhead expenditures and consequently
there is cost over run as well.

1 6.5.2
The problem of underground utility services gets further aggravated because
of lack of knowledge about their existence underneath or their exact alignment at the
time of preparation of project report or finalisation of designs. As such, these are
located at the time of excavation of foundation or driving of piles etc. This creates lot
of problems because the work has to be stopped and process of removing or shifting
started causing delays in the construction work indefinitely.
In some cases where the
removal or shifting of the service is not feasible, then the design has to be modified or
changed completely to avoid the obstruction.
16.5.3
As the
utility services are related to various departments, their removal or
shifting involves coordination between them.
In most of the cases, this work is carried
out without any sense of urgency or concern and without caring for the work program.
The various agencies work at their own convenience and as such work gets done in
piecemeal and without any planned and phased sequence, upsetting all time and cost
schedules, besides causing continued inconvenience to the public.
16.5.4
A dedicated Utility Manager or Coordinator should be assigned with the job
of handling this activity
.
1 6.5.5
The construction of the flyovers and elevated structures needs to be planned
and executed very meticulously.
It is desirable that the required investigations about
the location of the underground services, subsoil conditions and other issues, sorted
out before finalising the scheme.
The various pre-requisites are as follows:
a)
Detailed studies should be made to decide the location and alignment
of the underground
services,
live or defunct, and other/underneath
structures, from the records
available,
exploring
all the
possibilities
depending upon the cultural, geographical and historical importance of
the location.
b)
Detailed exploratory and subsoil investigations should be done along
the alignment and at the proposed locations of the foundations.
c)
Shifting and removal of the services and encroachments should be
planned in advance and work plan should match with the availability of
right of way.
d)
Availability of space at site
should be kept in view while planning and
designing, so that problemsarenotfaced atthetime of actual construction.
Lack of working space should be adequately considered
for type
of
design and suitability for construction within the space available.
75



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
e)
The alignment, location of pier and type of foundation and
its depth
should be carefully decided to suit the local conditions.
f)
The construction methodology should be so chosen, that
it is suitable
at site,
is time saving and cost effective.
g)
Precast
construction
techniques
should
be
considered
and
used
where feasible for superstructure so as to ensure faster construction
and better quality and finish and to avoid the problems of lack of space
during construction.
h)
The work program should be so phased out that minimum disturbance
is caused to traffic at any time and diversion of traffic could be planned
with least inconvenience to all concerned.
i)
The work should be planned in shifts consistent with traffic constraints
so that the machines and materials could be moved to site during lean
traffic periods or at night.
j)
Enough
barricading should be done
in
a clean and systematic
manner
to enclose
the work areas such
that
the
construction
activities do not attract undue attention of the
traffic and cause
any disturbance to
it.
k)
Adequate
safety
measures
should
be
adopted
as
per
the
construction safety manuals or various regulations or as per the
requirements at site.
17 INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE
.
17.1
introduction
17.1.1
The grade separators are very important structures and need to be kept
in
traffic worthy condition
all the time.
It
is necessary that
all these structures are
regularly inspected during construction to ensure quality during and after construction
as per a pre-determined program
or for specific requirements and maintained
or
repaired or rehabilitated at the earliest as may be demanded as per the result of these
inspections.
17.1.2
The
inspection
after construction and maintenance
of grade separators
can be done conforming to the provisions of IRC:SP:35 except for
its clauses and
provisions which are applicable to river
bridges only.
76



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 92
======================================================================
.
IRC:SP:90-2010
17.1.3
There are severe threats to durability and longevity of structures, especially
for urban grade separators because of their location, carrying
traffic much beyond
the designed volume in over populated cities
, increasing industrialization giving rise to
increased level of pollution and toxicity in the environment and because of use of new
type of materials, structural systems and faster construction techniques, which have
not been tested in the past, creating lot of uncertainties about the long term behaviour
of
materials and systems
.
As such, a suitable inspection and maintenance program need to be implemented to take
timely remedial measures and rehabilitate the structure before the situation worsens,
if
these structures can serve for their designed life. A suitable mobile inspection unit may
be used
to facilitate the inspection,
if required to suit the above program.
17.1.4
All the activities during construction are required to be inspected thoroughly.
After construction, the parts which require special and frequent attention are bearings,
expansion/contraction joints, drainage arrangements, etc.,
17.1.5
The design of a grade separator, therefore, should provide for -
Noticeable visual indications of impending failure.
Facilities for detailed inspection, repair and rehabilitation works.
17.2
Access for Inspection
17.2.1
To facilitate inspection, suitable facilities
should exist for the personnel to
access the parts or activities
which are to be inspected during construction or after
construction or
for maintenance. Mobile inspection units can be deployed wherever
feasible, or local arrangements suiting the requirements of inspections can be made.
17.2.2
A suitable access system provided at the time of construction can be more
helpful and practical arrangement for subsequent
inspections after construction and
for carrying out
regular maintenance and foreseeable repairs as easily as possible.
It ensures full safety of staff and causes least possible interruption to the traffic, both
above the flyover as well as the carriageway below
it. The inspectors should be able
to reach vulnerable points as easily as possible, inspect and maintain or repair them.
17.2.2.1
Inspection
platform around
pier and abutment with
railings and access
ladders
should be provided for this purpose.
77



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
17.2.2.2
An opening
in the diaphragms
of box girders
is
suitable for
inspection
inside the box. The size of opening should be such that men and equipment can be
taken inside. Sometimes manholes are provided in the bottom slab of the box.
17.2.2.3
For long flyovers and continuous bridges, access vestibule at one end may
be ideally suitable. Such a vestibule provides easy access to the inside of the box
girder and even heavy equipment can be taken through this vestibule. This area can
be used
for housing bridge monitoring equipment. This also helps
in
relieving the
earth pressure surcharge on abutment.
17.2.2.4
Expansion joints provided
at the end
of girders on the top of pier and
abutment need regular inspection. A suitable space between the end faces of main
beams or an inspection gallery around pier facilitates this
inspection.
17.2.2.5
Leakages from the drainage spouts or down take pipes should be noticed
and remedial measures taken immediately. Inspection of drainage spouts can be done
from footpaths.
17.2.2.6
Deflection/Camber monitoring is an important aspect of inspection. Suitable
platforms constructed to facilitate taking readings will be helpful in monitoring deflection/
camber of the girders.
Some 100 mm square patches made even
at regular longitudinal and transverse
intervals (as reference locations on the carriageway) could be used for periodic collection
of profile data. Such periodic deflection/profile monitoring of the superstructure enables
taking appropriate corrective measures including resurfacing.
17.2.2.7
Where footpaths have not been provided, a walkway or gangway is helpful
for inspection and maintenance personnel.
17.3
Drainage System
The drainage system should be carefully inspected during rainy season to ensure
that
its functioning
remains effective and serviceable during the
critical conditions.
Any stagnation or collection of water over the
deck, carriageway, valley curves or in
surrounding lanes or areas should be noticed and appropriate remedial measures be
implemented.
17.4
Illumination System
The
entire
illumination system
for the grade separator, signages and surrounding
area need to be inspected frequently to check
its functioning and effectiveness. The
78



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:90-2010
frequency of its failure at any point should be analysed and proper remedial measures
be taken to ensure that sufficient illumination
is available at all locations during night
or darkness.
17.5
Erection, Launching and Lifting Arrangements
17.5.1
The
lifting
of girder for replacement of bearings should be inspected
to
ensure that the
lifting
is being done at the designated design points only as may be
marked on the drawings and
it is being carried out as per the procedure laid out.
17.5.2
All the systems and machines used for construction, for erection, launching
or
lifting should be thoroughly inspected
to check that these are as per required
and prescribed specifications and are
in good working conditions and are not being
overloaded during their use.
17.5.3
These should be inspected and
test loaded after some repeated use, to
check that there are no distress, deformities and malfunctioning in them to make them
unsafe for further use.
17.6
Construction IVIachines, Plants and Equipments
17.6.1
All the construction plants and machinery and equipment should be regularly
inspected at designated frequency or as required to check their efficiency and proper
functioning and to take measures for their servicing or repair in time so that they do
not remain idle at the site.
17.6.2
It should
be seen
that these have been
calibrated
at the
prescribed
frequency or in case of any doubt.
17.7
IVIaintenance iVIanual
^
A maintenance manual should be prepared for all the grade separators where there
are some
special
or
specific maintenance
requirements because
of the design
philosophy
or
site
requirements
etc. The
maintenance
of the
structure
should
accordingly be ensured.
