1.2.
At its first meeting on 29"^ April, 2003,
the Committee felt that in the light of the massive
construction programme that was under execution
in the highway sector,
it was necessary to bring
out guidelines on certain topics which were not
adequately covered in the existing IRC Codes and
Standards. The design and construction of cast-
in-place voided slab superstructures was one of
the topics selected.
It was decided that while
highlighting the special design and detailing
requirements in each case, the guidelines would
be generally in line with IRC: 1 8 and IRC:2 1 with
additional inputs from BS:5400, EURO and
AASHTO codes, wherever necessary.
1.3.
The initial draft of the guidelines was
prepared by Shri T. Viswanathan and Dr. N.
Rajagopalan with some inputs from Shri C.V. Kand.
The draft was discussed by the B-6 Committee at
several meetings and finalized in its meeting held
on 3'^ September, 2004. The draft document was
approved by the Bridges Specifications and
Standards Committee in its meeting held on
2"'*
December, 2004 and by the Executive Corrmiittee
on
18"' December, 2004. The document was
considered by IRC Council in its
173''' meeting
held on
S"' January, 2005
in Bangalore and
approved with certain modifications.
The required modifications were accordingly
carried out by the Convenor, B-6 Committee
before sending the document for publication.
2.
SCOPE
The guidelines provide the basic approach for
analysis of voided slab superstructures by different
methods, design of various members and
information on general reinorcement detailing. The
designer is advised to consult relevant specialist
literature on the subject, if further information is
required.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:64-2005
3.
CROSS-SECTION DIMENSIONS
3.1.
The voids can be rectangular or circular.
3.1.1.
For slabs provided with circular voids, the
centre-to-centre spacing of the voids should not
be less than the total depth of the slab.
3.1.2.
In case of circular voids, the ratio of the
diameter of void to the total depth of slab shall not
exceed 75 per cent in order to avoid transverse
distortional effect.
3.1.3.
The thickness of the web shall be as per
Clause 9.3.1.1 of IRC: 18-2000 for prestressed
concrete slabs and as per Clause 305.2 of IRC:
21-2000 for reinforced concrete slabs.
3.1.4.
For reinforced concrete slabs: The
thickness of concrete above the void shall not be
less than 200 mm and that below the void shall not
be less than 175 mm.
3.1.5.
For prestressed concrete slabs:
If the
cables are not located in the flanges, the thickness
of flange shall be governed by provision as in para
3.1.4. If the cables are located in the flanges (not
in the web region), the thickness of flanges shall
be in accordance with the Clause 16. 1 of IRC: 18-
2000.
3.1.6.
For rectangular voids, in addition to the
above the transverse width of the void shall not
exceed 1.5 times the depth of the void.
3.2.
The portion of the slab near the supports
in the longitudinal direction on each side, shall be
made solid for a minimum length equivalent to the
depth of slab or 5 per cent of the effective span
whichever is greater.
3.3.
Materials used for Void Formers
Void formers are required to possess the
necessary rigidity and integrity of dimensions in
addition to being water tight.
The void formers may be manufactured from
materials, such as, steel sheets, card board, fibre
reinforced cement, timber, expanded polystyrene,
HDPE,
etc. They are generally corrugated for
rigidity. Special machines are available for
manufacture of corrugated steel void formers,
identical to those used for manufacture of pre-
stressing cable ducts.
4.
ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURE
4.1.
The structure shall be analysed both for
longitudinal as well as transverse stmctural actions.
4.1.1.
Where
the
voids
conform
to
the
dimensional requirements given above and the void
ratio does not exceed 40 per cent, the structure
may be analysed as a solid slab for bending moments
and shear forces due to longitudinal actions. Other
transverse structural actions can be evaluated using
the procedure outlined in para 5.2.3.
Void ratio is the ratio of area of the voids to
the total area of the slab without deducting the
area of voids.
This method is applicable to right and skew
bridges with skew angle upto 20°.
4.1.2.
If the void ratio exceeds 40 per cent, the
structure shall be analysed by any one of the
following methods:
(i)
Orthotropic Plate
(ii)
Grillage Analogy
(iii) Three Dimensional Continuum
4.1.3.
If the dimensional parameters mentioned
in para
3.1.1., 3.1.2 and 3.1.6 above are not
satisfied, any other appropriate method of analysis
shall be carried out for taking into account the
distortional effect.
5.
ORTHOTROPIC PLATE METHOD
The effects of live load can be obtained by
adopting the orthotropic plate theory. This method
is applicable to right and skew bridges with skevv
angle upto 20°.
5.1.
Analysis & Design for Loi^tudinal Action
The design forces (bending moment and shear)
for longitudinal structural action shall be calculated
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:64-2005
using the parameters given in Appendix-1, and
normal design procedure may be followed.
5.2.
Analysis & Design for Transverse Action
5.2.1.
Evaluation of Q^^
: The shear force
in
the transverse direction due to 20T axle load can
be
evaluated
by
using
the
graph
shown
in
Appendix-2. For any other axle load, the value
can be eavaluated by multiplying
obtained
from the graph by the ratio of heaviest axle load in
tonnes to 20 tonnes.
5.2.2.
Design
of compression
and
tension
flanges
: The
transverse moment
may be
obtained
as
shown
below
for
the
different
methods of analysis outlined in para 4 and the
moment
will be further resolved as axial forces
in the compression and tension flanges by using
centre-to-centre distance of flanges as lever arm.
(i)
Solid Slab Analysis
My shall be taken as 0.3 times the moment in
the longitudinal direction due to live load plus
0.2
times
the moment
in
the
longitudinal
direction due to dead load.
(ii) Orthotropic Plate Analysis
My
shall be the same as obtained from the
global analysis.
(iii) Grillage (Analogy) Analysis
M^ is the moment obtained for the transverse
beam of the grillage system.
(iv) Three Dimensional Constinuum Analysis
My need
not be
eavaluated. However,
the
compressive and tensile axial forces in the
flanges
shall be arrived by
integrating
the
normal
stresses
in
the
y-direction on
the
compression and tension flanges.
The tension flange shall be designed for an
axil tensile force of

distance of compession and tension flange. In case
of rectangular void, the compression flange shall

5.2.3.
Design of web
5.2.3.1.
Rectangular
voids
:
In
case
of
rectangluar voids,
the web
shall be designed
for local bending moment of M = QvS
This
reinforcement requirement shall be provided in
the form of links, however, only one leg of such
link may
be
considered
to
contribute
to
the
required area of reinforcement. This area should
be added to that required to resist the longitudianl
shear
to
give
the
total
required
area
of
link
reinforcement.
5.2.3.2. Circular voids
: In case of circular voids,
the occurance of cracks initiating from the inside
of void
has
to
be
prevented by
limiting
the
maximum tensile
stresses
at the surface of the
voids. The maximum
tensile
stresses
shall be
computed using the graph shown in Appendix-3
and
it shall be ensured that the tensile stresses
shall not exceed the allowable value of 0.36
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:64-2005
where f
, and the allowable tensile stress both are
ck
in MPa. Following two cases have
to be
considered:
(i)
Tensile
stresses
less than allowable
tensile stresses
Cracking at the inside of a void would not
occur in this situation and vertical reinforcement
in the webs should be provided to resist the bending
f
moment of
/h,
This reinforcement requirement shall be
provided in the form of links; however, only one
leg of such link may be considered to contribute
to the required area of reinforcement. This area
should be added to that required to resist the
longitudinal shear to give the total required area
of link reinforcement.
(ii) Tensile stresses more than allowable
limits
In this case, cracking would occur at the
inside of the void and inclined reinforcement
shall be provided. The inclined reinforcement
shall be provided to resist the tensile force of
T = 2h Cosa
' ^'^^^^ ^
slope of the
inclined reinforcement (to the horizontal). This
reinforcement shall be provided in the form of
links or bars and in case
it
is provided in the
form of bars,
it shall be anchored by lapping
the
compression
and
tension
flange
reinforcement.
Alternative to inclined reinforcement, one
additional layer of horizontal reinforcement
may be provided to resist the bending moment of
M = QdSin
at a distance of d Sin
6.
GRILLAGE ANALOGY
Standard grillage programme can be used to
analyse the structure. This method can be adopted
for right, skew and curved bridges. The boundary
conditions for the grillage elements shall be
properly introduced based on the direction of
placement of bearing.
The bending moment and shear forces will be
taken as
it
is for longitudinal structural action.
For transverse structural action, the corresponding
design forces, such as, transverse shear, bending
moment and axial forces
in the flanges and
bending moment and shear in the web shall be
evaluated as outlined under the orthotropic plate
method.
7.
THREE DIMENSIONAL
CONTINUUM ANALYSIS
Three dimensional continuum analysis shall
take care of all structural action both in longitudinal
and transverse directions with appropriate
structural properties. This can be achieved by
performing finite element analysis using stiffness
approach by discretising the structure into number
of elements and having the displacement evaluated
using the appropriate boundary conditions and
loading. Discretisation of the elements can be left
to the designer. However, it shall only be surface
element, such as, plate element, plate shell element,
solid brick element with or without shear
deformations.
The bending moment and shear forces will
be taken as
it
is for longitudinal structural
action. For transverse structural action, the
corresponding design forces, such as, transverse
shear, bending moment and axial forces in the
flanges and bending moment and shear in the web
shall be evaluated as outhned under the orthotropic
plate method.
8.
MINIMUM TRANSVERSE
REINFORCEMENT IN FLANGES
The transverse reinforcement in flanges
shall be provided in two layers, one layer closer
to the crown of the void and other closer to the
outer
surface.
The
area
of
transverse
reinforcement in compression flange should
be lesser of 1000 mmVm (500 mm7m in each
layer) or 0.7 per cent of the minimum flange area.
The tension flange
shall be provided with
transverse reinforcement of 1500 mmVm (750
mmVm in each layer) or 1 per cent of the minimum
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:64-2005
flange area whichever is lower.
For
the
purpose
of
calculating
the
reinforcement, the minimum flange area of each
layer of concrete shall be arrived at by taking the
thickness of concrete layer equal to twice the
relevant cover plus the bar diameter.
9.
MINIMUM LONGITUDINAL
REINFORCEMENT
9.1.
RCC Slabs
2000. The minimum reinforcement shall be
provided according to method of analysis adopted.

Clause 305.7 of IRC:21-2000.
9.2.
Prestressed Slabs
The minimum reinforcement shall be provided
as per Clause 15.1 of IRC: 18-2000.
10.
DETAILING
The minimum longitudinal reinforcement in
Typical reinforcement detailing for voided slab
slabs shall be as per Clause 305.19 of IRC:21-
is shown in Fig.
