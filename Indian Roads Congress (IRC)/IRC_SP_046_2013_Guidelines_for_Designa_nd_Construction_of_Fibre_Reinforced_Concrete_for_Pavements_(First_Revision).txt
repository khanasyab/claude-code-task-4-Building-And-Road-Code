GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF FIBRE REINFORCED
CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
1 INTRODUCTION
IRC:SP:46 "Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete for Pavements" was published
in 1997. These
guidelines served the profession well for more than a decade. However,
in the meantime
polymeric fibres have been developed for use in pavements. The Rigid Pavement Committee
(H-3)
felt the necessity to include the polymeric fibres
in the guidelines. Therefore, H-3
Committee decided to revise the IRC:SP:46 with enhanced scope. For this task, a sub-group
under the convenorship of Shri L.K. Jain including Shri PL. Bongirwar, Dr. S.C. Maiti, Shri J.B.
Sengupta as Members and Prof. Ravindra Gettu (invitee) was formed in the meeting of H-3
Committee held on 16
th April, 2012. The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) discussed the draft
which was prepared by the sub-group in series of meeting. The Rigid Pavement Committee
(H-3) approved the final draft in
its meeting held on 6
th October, 2012 for placing before the
HSS Committee. The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) approved this
document in its meeting held on 13
th December, 2012. The Executive Committee in its meeting
held on 19
th December, 2012 approved
this document.
Finally, the Council approved
this
document in their meeting held on 8
th January, 201 3 at Coimbatore and authorized the Convenor,
Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) to incorporate the comments of Council members and place
the same before the HSS Committee before publishing. Accordingly, H-3 Committee modified
the draft which was approved by the HSS Committee in
its meeting held on 19
th July, 2013.

2 SCOPE
2.1
This document provides the guidelines for the use of Fibre Reinforced Concrete
(FRC)
in pavements. The aspects
that are
peculiar
to FRC and those
that
differ from
conventional Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) are discussed.
In addition, the procedures
for the design of FRC pavements and for the characterisation of FRC toughness & flexural
strength test are detailed.
The fibres (both steel and polymeric) considered here, are to be added during the mixing of
the concrete or to the already mixed concrete such that they are thoroughly dispersed in the
matrix.
2.2
This document deals only with short length (up to 60 mm) discontinuous fibres
used in pavement concrete.
2.2.1
Use
of asbestos, carbon and,
cellulose
fibre, as
well
ultra
high performance
('ductal') concrete
is excluded from this document. Use of fibres
in other forms
like tows,
cables, tendons, rods, mats etc. are also not covered in this document.
2.3
This document is for use of fibres in cement based matrix such as concrete, micro-
concrete, and used in concrete pavement and related repair applications.
2.4
The design and construction of sub-grade and sub-base layer(s) below the FRC
pavement shall conform to the requirements of IRC:58-2011 and IRC:1 5-2011. For guidance
the documents given
in References should be
referred
for issues
not
fully dealt
in
this
document.
2.5
Fibres can improve the performance of concrete (or cement based matrix):-
i)
During and before the attainment of substantial strength, and
ii)
During the service life of the member.

2.6
FRC is useful in concrete pavement to control cracking (plastic shrinkage, reflection
etc.) to enhance inherent flexural strength,
to impart high toughness and to provide post
crack ductility.
3 APPLICATIONS OF FRC
3.1
FRCs are advantageous
in many applications.
In simple cost comparison with
concrete without fibres, FRC may appear to be costly in the beginning. However, advantages
of FRC, more than justify the additional cost. Improvements in crack control and post cracking
behaviours are the main advantages of FRC. FRC gives improved flexural toughness (ability
to absorb energy after cracking), impact resistance, and flexural fatigue endurance.
3.2
Initially, fibres were used as secondary reinforcement or for crack control
in less
critical concrete elements. Now, these are used as the main (structural) reinforcement in slab
on grade, industrial floors, pavements, and as the structural base. These can also be used
in sub-bases for pavement or cement treated sub-bases which are susceptible to shrinkage
cracking.
In general fibre concrete can be used
in
al! applications where plain concrete can
be used.
3.2.1
FRC with higher flexural strength, shear strength, toughness, fatigue endurance
and better post crack behaviour,
is needed for concrete pavements, runways, bridge decks,
wearing coats etc. SFRC and PSFRC (Polymeric Structural FRC) has been used in a number
of highway pavement, airport pavements, and bridge decks with fibre content 0.5% to 1.5%
by volume (say 40 to 120 kg/m 3 for steel fibres, and 4.5 to 14 kg/m 3 for polypropylene fibres).
FRC
is also useful
in upper layer of two
lift construction of concrete pavement. The mix
design for the same (upper layer) may prefer harder aggregates and smaller in size. FRC
with or without adding
silica fume (up to 10% by weight of cementious materials)
is also
useful in pavements.
3.2.2
FRC having significant residual strength at large deformation (i.e. deflection/crack
width or strain), can be successfully utilized for pavements.
3.2.3
Ultra
thin and
thin concrete overlays on bituminous layers need concrete with
high straining capacity (ductility). By inclusion of fibre, the strength, the toughness and the
endurance are enhanced without
significantly changing
the modulus
of
elasticity
of the
concrete. Thus FRC
is one of the most competitive pavement materials,
if the mechanistic
design system is applied for optimizing the performance levels. For taking this advantage the
design method has to radically change.
For ultra thin and thin overlays (white topping), following shall be the limiting parameters for
PQC consisting of FRC:

FRC Thickness
Minimum Value of
/sISOk ^tk
50 mm
0.4
100 mm
0.3
3.2.4
On cracked concrete pavements, overlay has to
resist sympathetic
(or
reflex)
cracking; there FRC is can give satisfactory performance. At the positions of reflex cracking,
FRC can take significant deformation
after cracking and before disintegrating.
In such a
case only part (say two third) of peak flexural strength may be
utilized for stress design,
and remaining capacity to be utilized for control over reflex cracking. At present data on the
toughness requirement is not available for this application.
3.3
FRC has been used to provide durable concrete pavements with improved cracking
resistance and
reduction
in
the
required
slab
thickness.
However,
the main
properties
associated with FRC such as ductility and toughness are to be reflected in the current design
procedures.
3.4
FRC has better control over plastic shrinkage cracking, and
is resistant to drying
shrinkage. For resisting cracks (due to plastic shrinkage and plastic settlement) in very young
age of concrete (1 to 8 hours) micro fibres like polymeric (e.g. polypropylene) are used in low
volume fraction say minimum 0.1% by volume of concrete (i.e. 0.91 kg/m 3 for polypropylene
fibres) to 0.2% by volume of concrete.
3.5
Normally micro fibres of about 20 mm length give better performance. Polymeric
micro fibres are used to control plastic shrinkage cracking
in bridge decks, suspended slab,
slab-on-grade, pavements, white toppings, wearing coat, etc. Most fine diameter (8 to 32 urn)
micro fibres with a high specific fibre surface area are particularly effective in reducing plastic
shrinkage cracking. Slight change
in length of fibre does not significantly affect the control
over plastic shrinkage cracking. Micro polymeric fibres for plastic shrinkage control in dosage
of 0.1% by volume of concrete are combined with any macro fibres needed for enhancing
flexural strength and toughness.
In
next stage while concrete
is
hardening,
for crack
resisting
(due
to temperature and
shrinkage) the fibres having higher modulus of elasticity (near that of immature concrete) are
suitable. For controlling drying shrinkage cracks, macro fibres (polymeric or steel etc.) can be
used in combination with micro fibres at total dosages of 0.3% or more by volume of concrete,
in which 0.1%
is micro fibres to control plastic shrinkage, and remaining will be macro fibres
for enhancing the flexural strength and toughness of concrete. For these applications, length
of fibres can be 20 to 60 mm.
In hardened concrete fibre of much higher modulus of elasticity (nearly equal to or more than
concrete) are effective in crack resistance. For both of these actions (plastic shrinkage and
structural strength) a blend of micro polymeric and macro fibres may give an economical option.
Hence to control cracks in all stages of concrete, hybrid fibres can be more effective.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
For pavements and slab-on-grade usefulness of macro fibre
is proved due to higher impact
resistance, higher flexural toughness, higher stress ratio for flexural fatigue endurance and
post cracking residual strength, in addition to some control over shrinkage cracking.
3.6
For pavements
with
macro
(steel
or
polymeric)
fibres,
usually FRC
having
characteristic flexural strength 5 to 8 M Pa may be used.
At Mumbai and Thane
in some overlays and thin white topping M60 grade concrete with
polymeric fibres has been used, and the performance of overlay, so far is good.
The flexural toughness of concrete may be increased
significantly with macro polymeric
fibres or steel fibres dosages 0.4 to
1 .0% by volume of concrete. Fibre dosages above
1 .5%
by volume of concrete can give strain hardening effect.
3.6.1
For plain concrete the stress ratio for flexural fatigue endurance (at 2 million test
cycles)
is usually 0.45 to 0.5, whereas for FRC with high dosages of steel fibres
it can be
from 0.65 to 0.9. Higher factor 0.7 and above can not be used, unless results of specific
investigations are available. For load
reversal the fatigue strength
is only slightly
less.
If
micro polymeric fibres are used
in small dosage (<0.3% by volume of concrete) for plastic
shrinkage control, the endurance stress ratio 0.45 will remain.
3.6.2
If micro polymeric fibres are used
in higher dosages (0.3% or more by volume
of concrete) for plastic shrinkage control, the endurance stress ratio can be taken as 0.5 in
place of 0.45 for plain concrete.
3.6.3
From AASHTO-AGC-ARTBA TF36R "The use and State of Art - Practice of Fibre
Reinforced Concrete", 2001, following is quoted:
"Properly designed FRC mixtures will have fatigue endurance of over 2 million cycles at
65 to 90 percent of the static flexural strength for non reversed loading, and slightly less
endurance when fully reversed loading is used."
3.7
Shear strength of FRC is significantly higher. In all cases, durability of fibre concrete
is significantly better.
3.7.1
In SFRC crack widths upto 0.3 mm have no adverse effect on corrosion of steel
fibres.
In long term, steel fibres within 2.5 mm from surface may be susceptible to corrosion
and its effect on structural capacity is insignificant, except discolouration at the surface in the
long run.
3.8
Use of virgin polypropylene monofilament fibres 32 urn size (optimum size) at
about 1.5 kg/m 3 dosages
in high strength concrete,
inhibit explosive spalling
in the event
of a fire.
If subjected to fire hazard on a pavement, compared to plain concrete, FRC with
polymeric fibres will show a better durability.
3.9
FRC has improved resistance to blast and impact actions, where high toughness
is required.

======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
3.10
Structural FRC can be usefully deployed in the following areas:
i)
Concrete pavements (PQC/overlays,
thin and
ultra-thin white topping) for
roads, runways and bridge decks.
ii)
Overlays
for
rehabilitation
or
strengthening
of
roads,
runways,
bridge
decks.
iii)
Thin or ultra thin overlays where overhead clearance is critical.
iv)
Rotaries,
intersections, and locations where odd shapes of pavement are
required.
v)
Toll plaza with only polymeric fibres or in combination with steel fibers.
3.11
FRC pavement can be opened to traffic earlier
if the flexural strength of concrete
of about half the specified value can be achieved at an age of 1 to 3 days only, by choosing
an appropriate mix proportion and fiber content.
4 PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF FRC
4.1
Fibres
4.1.1
Steel fibres
Steel fibres should have an ultimate tensile strength of at least 800 MPa.
Fibres can be
straight or deformed. The manufacturer shall declare the shape of the fibre. Photos of different
shapes of steel fibres are given in Fig. 1.

======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
Fibres can be supplied
loose or collated
(i.e., glued with a water-soluble adhesive that
dissolves during the mixing of concrete). Collated fibres have a lower tendency of balling.
When steel fibres are supplied with a coating (e.g. zinc coating), the type and characteristic
quantity of coating shall be declared by the manufacturer, along with details of any adverse
reactions that could occur in an alkaline environment such as within concrete.
As a guide, for improving performance, steel fibres hooked end and having lengths of about
50 to 60 mm may be used.
4.1.2
Polymeric fibres
Polymeric fibres with low elastic modulus are not expected to increase the load-resisting
capacity of the concrete significantly, at low dosages. Such micro fibres are monofilament or
in fibrillated form, and vary in lengths from about 12 mm to 40 mm. These fibres are normally
used to control plastic shrinkage cracking.
Macro Polymeric fibres
in 30 to 60 mm length, of higher elastic modulus can increase the
toughness and the strength capacity of the FRC pavement. Macro fibres have diameter more
than 0.2 mm. Micro fibres are in 12 to 40 mm length and have diameter less than 0.2 mm.
For Tests of Polymeric Fibres Refer Appendix E.
4.2
Aggregate Size
Maximum size of aggregate shall depend upon the thickness of the pavement and the average
spacing of well dispersed fibres in concrete.
For most applications nominal maximum size of aggregate could be 20 mm. However, as
per IRC:15, maximum size of aggregate shall not exceed 31.5 mm. Suitable grading of the
aggregate shall be adopted.
A sample grading
is given in Table 1 for initial trials for macro fibre reinforced concrete. The
final grading in the successful mix may differ from the range in the Table 1.

Above grading
is for macro fibre 0.65 to
1 mm diameter and dosages of about 0.5 to 1% by
volume of concrete. [Derived from ACI 544. 1]
In case of performance oriented (purchase option) specifications, the supplier can use a
maximum size of aggregate not exceeding that given in the specifications or smaller.
4.2.1
As the number of fibres in a unit volume of concrete increases, the spacing between
the fibres reduces. This poses a limit on maximum size of coarse aggregate and its percentage
fraction
in the mix. Larger aggregate size may interfere with the uniform dispersion of fibres.
Coarse aggregate of 20 mm maximum size
is suitable for low volume fraction up to about
0.3% by volume of concrete for polymeric micro fibres.
It
is also suitable for macro fibres
up to
1 .0% by volume
(i.e. 80 kg/m 3 for steel fibres). However, these limits are qualitative
indications and can change as the size (equivalent diameter) of the fibre changes.
In actual
case trials should be undertaken to derive maximum efficiency from the fibre in a particular
mix.
For increasing dosages of fibres and decreasing equivalent diameter, the spacing of fibres will
be smaller, thus the maximum size of aggregate may suitably be reduced to 15 mm, 12 mm
or even 10 mm as required. The proportion of coarse aggregate, for optimized performance
of FRC
will
also be
suitably
reduced. The aggregate
size should
result
in
satisfactory
workability, cohesiveness
in concrete, and the uniform dispersion of fibres, as proven by
trials beforehand.
4.2.2
For bridging the cracks and for good performance, length of fibre may be 2 to
3 times the nominal maximum size of aggregate. However, the method of dosing, mixing
and other construction processes may impose a limit lower than that which can give better
properties in hardened concrete. In case of pumped concrete length of fibre may not be more
than 2/3rd of the diameter of the FRC delivery pipe.
4.2.3
The permissible flakiness and
elongation (combined) index could be up
to a
maximum of 35% for total aggregate 10 mm and 20 mm together. However, coarse aggregate
having maximum combined flakiness and elongation index up to 25% shall be preferred.
It
is recommended that for aggregate fraction 10 mm and below, flakiness and elongation
(combined) index could be smaller.
4.2.4
To achieve proper bond
of concrete with
fibres, the finer material
(i.e.
size of
cementitious particles e.g. cement and flyash etc.)
in the mix should be enough
in relation
to the total surface area of the fibers. Continuous grading and presence of enough particles,
one
fifth to one twentieth of fibre size are important to achieve efficient fibre concrete mix.
This effect may not be significant for macro fibres (diameter > 0.2 mm)
in dosage < 0.4%
by volume or for micro fibres < 0.1% by volume of concrete. To keep shrinkage low the
OPC content shall be restricted, while increasing the total cemetitious material. Thus flyash
content can be higher than that permitted in normal concrete.
4.2.5
The fine aggregate content shall be 45-68% of total aggregate, depending on the
maximum size of coarse aggregate (more % with smaller aggregate size), and increasing
with dosages of fibre.

Mix Proportioning
Mix proportioning
is to achieve the targeted and desirable properties
in fresh and hardened
state of concrete. Use of any method to arrive at mix proportioning, which gives the desired
performance,
is permitted. Past experience and trials can guide the proportioning process.
The aim of mix proportioning shall also be, to enhance the performance efficiency of the
fibers in the concrete. In mix proportioning consider the fibre as an additional constituent to a
concrete, and the mix may not be same for concrete without fibres and with fibres.
Mix proportioning shall conform to the requirement of transporting, laying and compacting the
FRC pavement. The required properties of fresh/plastic concrete may differ significantly with
the methods of construction and equipment to be deployed.
4.3.1
Cement OPC
(IS:8112,
IS:12269,
IS:8041),
slag cement (PSC-
IS:455), PPC
(IS:1489-1) can be used. Cement strength at 28 days shall not be less than 43 MPa. Blending
(or multiple blending) with mineral admixtures (additives) shall be done at the batch mixing
plant or high efficiency mixers like pan mixers or twin shaft mixers.
4.3.2
As per IRC: 15 the flyash content will be about 20% of total cementitious material.
However, with the written permission of the Engineer
it can go up to 35%; and the usual range
is 20 to 35%.The GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag) content can be 25 to 50%
of total cementitious material. The silica fume 5 to 10% is required for high strength concrete,
and for enhancing abrasion resistance.
Multiple blending duly optimized,
is permitted for
better performance of FRC.

4.3.3
For a properly proportioned FRC mix, there may not be any significant reduction
(< 5%) in compressive strength of FRC compared to the concrete without fibres.
4.3.4
It is necessary to arrive at the mix proportion such that it does not bleed. In bleeding
concrete micro polymeric fibres tend to rise up to the top surface of concrete, causing reduction
in the quantity of fibres in the mix.
4.3.5

nl
ol concrete shall normally be 140 to 180 kg/m
3 of concrete. For F5
(flexural strength 5 MPa) concrete free water content should not be more than 160 kg/m 3
.
And ratio of water to cementitious content also should not exceed 0.4.
Typically the dosages of superplasticizer (naphthalene base or melamine base) could be
0.4 to 1.4% of cementitious content.
Poly-carboxylic based superplasticizer can be used
in smaller dosages for normal FRC, or in > 0.5% for free flow or self compacting concrete.
Actual dosages shall be worked out from trials.
4.3.6
The proportioning should also consider the parameters to avoid balling of fibres.
Higher cohesiveness of the mix can reduce chances of balling. The mix should be cohesive
enough to hold the fibres, without segregation.
For the mix to be efficient for the fibres, the grading curve (graph of sieve size and percentage
passing) of aggregates (coarse and finer together) could be drifted towards finer side.
4.3.7
The combined grading curve of coarse and fine aggregates down up to 75 urn
(micron) size should be checked for getting smooth grading. The percentage passing through
300 micron sieve should be 7 to 20%,
if maximum size of aggregate
in mix
is 20 mm. The
finer material will increase as the dosages of fibre will increase from 0.2% to 1% by volume
of concrete.
It should be noticed that in this regard use of crushed sand becomes desirable.
It is preferable to use natural fine aggregate of zone 3.
If
it is not available, the available fine
aggregate can be modified by combining with crushed sand or by mixing a small percentage
(4 to 8%) of crusher fines, thus to improve the continuous grading.
With fibres, their surface area adds to the total surface area of aggregates; and the surface
area increases with the dosages of fibres and inversely with finer size (equivalent diameter)
of fibre. Hence for optimum performance of fibre's contribution
in concrete, the quantity of
fines required in the concrete may increase with increasing surface area of fibres. By addition
of fibres, the demand of particles smaller than fibre size can increase.
4.3.7.1
Total finer material including cement, mineral admixtures (flyash
etc.) and finer
portion of finer aggregate, together passing through 300 micron sieve should not be less than
400 kg/m 3
,
if fibre dosages
is more than 0.1% by volume of concrete. For fibre dosages of
about 0.3% by volume of concrete, finer material may be about 450 kg/m 3
, and
still higher for
higher dosages of fibres say up to 540 kg/m 3
.
4.3.8
It
is economical to have the higher grade of concrete getting maximum possible

flexural strength, compatible with the materials, the construction methodology and quality
management. Where fibres are used only to control plastic shrinkage cracking the minimum
grade of concrete should be F4.5 (4.5 MPa characteristic flexural strength) at 28 days age,
as per IRC:58 and IRC: 15. As the aim of fibres
is to maximize the flexural strength of the
FRC, preferably minimum grade of FRC will be F5 (characteristic flexural strength 5 MPa) or
more, where contribution of fibres is accounted in the design. Refer Appendix C for a typical
mix proportion.
4.3.9
The concrete mix proportioning shall be valid for the range of workability required
on a project. For this purpose the dosages of chemical admixture (plasticizer) could be divided
in two parts, the minimum dosages and the provisional dosages.
4.3.10
For freeze and thaw
resistance
air
content
in
concrete
should
be
typically
4 to 6%.
4.4
Workability (Slump) of Concrete
Workability deals with entire range of mobility and
fluidity, from driest to wettest possible
fresh or plastic concrete. Workability requirements are largely influenced by method and
equipment for pavement construction, and to some extent by thickness of concrete, spacing
of reinforcement
if any etc.
4.4.1
For concrete laid by slip-form paver, workability requirement may range between
20 mm to 50 mm of slump at the time of placing, depending on the temperature of concrete,
the ambient temperature at the time of laying and the speed of laying
(in m/minute).
If the
workability is more than the critical value required, the concrete edge left fresh by paver will not
be able to retain proper shape and may bulge. Under conditions of 1 6°C ambient temperature
almost a no slump (<10 mm) concrete may be required, and for concrete temperature 30°C,
50 mm slump concrete may be required. Actual slump requirement should be assessed for
the particular concrete and the environmental conditions, based on the trials
in field. For a
particular situation the range of workability (variation minimum to maximum
i.e. workability
window)
is quite small for slip-form method of construction. Workability corrections may be
required every few hours.
4.4.1 .1
To maintain required workability at the time of placing,
it will have to be adjusted at
the production site, keeping in view the ambient temperature and the haulage distance from
production site to laying site. This will be achieved by trials in the field. The adjustment or fine
tuning of workability is permitted during construction keeping in view the ambient temperature
and relative humidity. FRC can be transported in transit mixer, and in case of harsh mix with
short haulage transportation in tippers covered with tarpaulin can be permitted.
4.4.2
For concrete laid by fixed form paver, workability requirement may range between
35 mm to 75 mm depending up on the temperature of concrete, the ambient temperature
and effectiveness of the method of compaction adopted. For concrete
laid without paver,
consolidated by screed vibrator higher slump (60 to 100 mm) may be required. These limits
will not be applicable to pumped concrete, which may require a slump of 120 to 160 mm.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
4.4.3
Most common
method
to measure
workability
is
by slump
cone
(IS: 11 99),
which can measure with an accuracy of ±20 mm for low (20 to 75 mm) and medium slump
(50 to 100 mm), and ±30 mm for high slump (> 100 mm). For low slump concrete degree of
compacting method or Vee-Bee (Vebe time) method are better suitable for workability test,
which may be 20 to 7 seconds. For workability tests refer IS:1199 (ISO 1920-2, EN 12350-2
to 5, DIN 1048).
4AA
With addition of fibres to concrete, its workability gets reduced, and a fibre concrete
mix also needs proper workability for placing and compaction.
4.4.5
For
increasing
workability
of
concrete
mix,
plasticizer
(or super
plasticizer)
in suitable dosages may be added. For compensating the loss of workability due to time
delay, retarders (or retarding plasticizer) would be required at the first mixing. By addition of
plasticizer at the time of delivery (i.e. second dose with adequate mixing), proper workability
could be achieved for delayed deliveries. Re-dosing of plasticizer is permitted to improve the
slump by 40 mm maximum, provided this provisional dosage
is also accounted
in the mix
proportioning and trial mix exercises to achieve specified strength.
4.4.6
For proper workability management,
it
is necessary
to keep the temperature
of concrete as being placed, within a narrow range. With variations
in the temperature of
concrete, the loss of workability of the mix and thus the dosing of admixture would change.
Hence temperature of concrete at mixer and
at pouring should be noted. At the time of
pouring of concrete
its temperature should not exceed 30°C as per IRC: 15. Temperature of
concrete in the batch mix plant will normally be around 25°C.
4.5
Dosing of Fibres
4.5.1
For construction, the dosage of fibre shall be specified in kg/m 3 of concrete. For a
batch of concrete to be produced, the fibres shall be weighed accurately (-0 +6% of specified
quantity).
In case of micro fibres, the quantity of fibre
in a pack should be suitable for one
batch of mix.
4.5.2
Fibres will be dispensed in clump-free state such that a homogenous and uniform
distribution
is obtained with no balling effect.
4.5.3
Speed of flow of fibre
into the mixer would dependent on the mixer type, the
aspect ratio of fibres, the dosages of fibres (mass of fibre per batch of concrete), etc. Method
of dosing recommended by the manufacturer of the fibre should be given due consideration.
Method of dosing and appropriate speed of dosing should be checked by trials.
4.5.3.1
Fibres may be added to the feed belt of the coarse aggregate
in a batch mixing
plant. The other option is to add fibres in to the mixer during or at the end of the feeding of mix
constituents.
In most cases the fibres are added after the aggregates are fed in to the mixer,
and while cementitious material being added.
4.5.4
A vibrating screen or other device for separating fibres (from each other) may
be required to avoid clumping of fibres prior to mixing with concrete. Dosing of fibres could
12



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 60
======================================================================
!RC:SP:46-2013
be done with different types of equipment. The types of equipment could be -
(i) vibrating
hopper and a chute,
(ii) vibrating hopper and a belt conveyor or screw conveyor,
(iii) blower
or pneumatic placer, etc.
4.5.5
It is noted that in hot and dry climate addition of fibres by pneumatic placer has a
drying and heating effect on concrete, thereby reducing the workability drastically and also
the setting time. Hence this method of dosing should be carefully evaluated and may require
higher dosages of retarders and plasticizer.
4.5.6
Fibres could be added either manually (only on smaller projects) or by dosing
equipment, which allows loose fibres to be added as a stream during mixing and not added in
lots at any instant, except if otherwise recommended by the manufacturer of fibres (e.g. glued/
bundled/in degradable bags). The stream of fibres added to mixer shall be at a nearly uniform
rate such that the fibre dosage is added in a period recommended by the manufacturer or as
established by trials, while the mixer is mixing the materials.
4.5.7
Table 3 gives the nominal fibre dosages in kg/m 3 for different volume fractions of
fibre. Volume fraction of fibre
is the ratio of volume of fibre to gross volume of compacted
concrete, expressed
in percentage.
In this document wherever the fibre dose is indicated
in
%,
it is the volume fraction of concrete.
Dosages in kg/m 3 = 10 x (fibre volume in %) * (specific gravity of fibre material)

.
4.6
Mixing FRC
Concrete shall be mixed such that the mix
is uniform and the fibres are dispersed through
out the mass uniformly. Tests on samples taken at different points
in the discharge from
mixer could show the degree of uniformity. Variations in slump, air content and compressive
strength of concrete sampled from different points of time for discharge could also indicate
the short fall in uniformity of mixing.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
The mixing efficiency is indicated by the variations in the proportion of coarse aggregate in a
sample of recorded size. However, with FRC,
it is also necessary to evaluate variations in the
proportion of fibres. In addition to such test, regularly the mixed concrete should be inspected
visually to ensure that the mixing
is uniform and fibres are well dispersed.
For a mixer, reducing a batch size and/or increasing the mixing time can enhance the mixing
efficiency. Mixing efficiency test is highly important for tilting drum mixers or mixers other than
pan mixers and twin shaft mixers.
4.6.1
Mixing time for FRC can be
1 5 to 25% higher compared to concrete without fibres.
Pan mixer or twin shaft mixers are highly efficient, and can do a good job with 20 seconds of
mixing time.
4.6.2
For each FRC job, optimum time for uniform mixing should be found by trials, and
same may change, as the ingredients change, more specially the fibre content. Mixing time
will also change with working rpm of the mixer and with wear of the blades.
4.6=3
The mixing time shall be as per the recommendations of mixer manufacturer for
FRC and verified by mixer efficiency test.
4.6.4
In case of self compacting concrete, the major dosages of plasticizer may be
added after the fibres are put into the concrete.
4.7
Fibre Balling
Tendency of fibres to get entangled with each other, tending to clump or form a ball shape
is called as fibre balling
(i.e. lump of un-dispersed fibres forming three dimensional
unit).
The ball or a lump of fibres
in concrete mix has significant air entrapped, and
is devoid of
aggregates. FRC shall be free of fibre balls when delivered.
4.7.1
One should study the causes of fibre balling, and the conditions which tend to form
the
ball. The whole operation of dosing and mixing should be engineered (designed) such
that chances of balling are eliminated,
i.e. high level of reliability should be achieved
in the
process. From the zone of entry of fibres, movements
in the mixer should carry the fibres
away into the mix faster than they are added. Balls are formed while fibres get stacked up
during handling
if carried too fast. Fibres should not be allowed to pile up or slide down the
vanes of partially filled drum, that otherwise will result in balling.
4.7.2
Chances of balling are higher with higher dosages (% volume of concrete) of
fibres, and also higher with higher aspect ratio. Harsh mixes (not fluid enough or not workable
enough) take longer time to mix the fibres without balling.
If fibres are added to mixer first
while the other materials (aggregate) are not enough to keep the fibres away from each other,
the balls may form. Within mixer, absence of different types of particle motions may give rise
to balling. Inefficient mixer or that with worn out blades can have tendency to produce balls.
Trials should confirm that the specified dosages of fibres of given aspect ratio can be mixed
uniformly, without causing balling action.
14



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
4.7.3
If at
all any fibre
ball
is noticed
in the concrete,
it should be removed by hand
picking. The loss of fibres by way of balls should not be more than 5% of the dose specified
otherwise the FRC will be rejected.
4.8
Unit Weight of FRC
As per IS:11 99, the unit weight of FRC is determined similar to that of conventional concrete.
Significant lowering of the unit weight of fresh FRC could indicate the incorporation of air due
to inappropriate mix proportioning. Large variations in the unit weight could indicate the non-
uniform dispersion of fibres within the concrete.
4.9
Homogeneity of Fibre Dosage
The content of fibre
shall be checked from samples obtained from fresh
concrete.
It
is
recommended that the number of samples shall be at least 6, each with a volume of concrete
contained in a bucket of 10 litres capacity.
4.9.1
Each fresh concrete sample will be placed over a 5 mm sieve and washed with
water to remove the fine contents. From the remaining mass of aggregates and
fibres,
the fibres are to be separated manually, dried and weighed. The average weight of fibres
obtained
is used to determine the nominal fibre dosage, which shall not be less than 90%
of the specified fibre dosage. For steel fibres, a magnet or an electromagnet can be used to
extract the fibres.
4.9.2
In case, the content of fibres has to be estimated in hardened concrete, 12 cores
of at least 100 mm diameter should be extracted from the PQC layer. Each core should be
trimmed to a uniform length and crushed, after recording the dimensions and weight of each
core. The fibres should be separated and weighed to ascertain the nominal fibre content for
each core. Individual value of fibre content shall not be less than 85% of the specified fibre
dosage and the average of all samples should be above 90% of the specified fibre dosage.
4.10
Placing and Finishing
In most cases transporting, placing, compacting and finishing can be done by conventional
methods of concrete pavement construction.
Compaction should be done by surface/screed vibrators, with due care to avoid over vibration.
Use of immersion (needle/internal/poker) vibrator put nearly vertical, should be avoided as
far as possible, because their use can disturb the orientation of fibres and may align more
fibres
in a
vertical
direction. Gang of immersion vibrators
(as with
slip-form pavers) put
nearly horizontal, are acceptable for pavement, because this may cause more fibres to align
horizontally, resulting
in advantage for flexural strength of the slab. For more details refer
IRC:15andACI 544.3.
4.10.1
Most operations of handling, placing, finishing, extreme weather concreting, curing
and protection are similar to conventional concrete as in IRC:15. For more details specialized
literature on concrete construction and pavement construction may be referred.

Steel
fibre
reinforced
concrete
can
be
finished
with
conventional
tools and
equipment, with minor refinements
in techniques and workmanship are needed. Screeding
is carried out by steel bar/roller/flat section with rounded edges.
Steel float is used behind the paver. The protruding steel fibres should be pressed
in green
-
reti
,
th
a1 the same an- "Arab
into the concrete. After that the surface can be floated
and textured as per requirement. Any exposed steel fibre protruding out from the top surface
should to be cut or grinded.
4.10.3
Most operations
of protection,
texturing
(or
tinning) and
curing
are
similar
to
conventional concrete as per IRC: 15. The newly laid concrete shall be covered against rapid
drying and cured immediately after the finishing operations have been completed.
Initial
curing can be done by application of a curing membrane followed by the spreading of wet
hessian (or jute cloth) and moistening
it regularly, or by ponding. Curing shall be done for a
minimum period of fourteen days.
4.10.4
Thin pavement concrete (or overlays)
in FRC are more susceptible to lapses
in
curing, hence requires more precautions and closer supervision. Fibres help
in controlling
shrinkage cracking, and the provision of micro fibres
is recommended for resisting plastic
shrinkage cracking, however,
all the precautions for early age curing are important such
as mist spray or fogging or fuming the surface within one hour of placing concrete. These
precautions are required
till wet curing or spray of curing compound
is done. Thin bonded
overlays need uninterrupted curing for its development of bond with the layers below.
4.10.5
The cutting of grooves shall be done just after the
initial setting of the concrete
to produce a contraction joint. This could range between 6 hours to 24 hours depending on
the concrete used and the ambient conditions. Grooves should be cut using a water-cooled
diamond-edged disc saw. The groove should be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the
carriageway and made to a depth of one-third of the thickness of the FRC layer. The spacing
of contraction joint is normally 20 to 36 times the thickness of the FRC layer, and not more
than 4.5 to 5.0 m. The Longitudinal groove should also be cut simultaneously to about one
third depth of slab.
4.11
Properties of FRC in Hardened State
4.11.1
The compressive strength of concrete is determined as for conventional concrete
as per IS:516. Care should be taken to ensure that internal needle/poker vibrator is not used
to compact the any test specimens of FRC, as
it will cause significant non-uniformity in the
distribution ol Fibres and coarse aggregates
in the specimen.
4.11.2
It
is to note that micro-fibres are not expected
to increase the strength of the
concrete. Reduction of strength of the concrete significantly, may indicate an inefficient mix
proportioning or in adequate mixing of the FRC.
4.11.3
Flexural
strength and toughness
of FRC
are the most
important parameters
for design and quality control. The test described
in Appendix B gives the recommended
procedure for determining the flexural strength (fc{ ) and the equivalent flexural strength (£ 150 ).
The characteristic values of both parameters (fctk and
/
e150k ) are used in the design of the FRC
pavement.

In the absence of sufficient data for the determination of the characteristic value,
the characteristic equivalent flexural strength of FRC can be taken as:
where
/
e150m
is the mean equivalent flexural strength obtained from tests on a set of at least
6 specimens.

average value, take/
ctk = 0.8

ctk is characteristic strength, and
/
ctm is mean strength as obtained from test results.
5 SPECIFYING FIBRE REINFORCED CONCRETE

5.2
There can be different approaches or basis of specifying concrete under a contract.
The main distinction
is the prescriptive approach and the performance approach.

Option B (Prescriptive Approach)
The specification designer/purchaser assume the responsibility of designing and proportioning
the concrete mix for the intended purpose. The prescriptive approach
is not recommended
and
it is discouraged.

IRC:SP:46-2013
DESIGN OF FRC PAVEMENTS
6 GENERAL ASPECTS OF DESIGN
6.1
In
general the design and
construction
of layers below FRC pavement
shall
conform to the requirements of IRC:15 and IRC:58. The FRC pavement design
will also
be guided by IRC:58. The CBR of the natural or modified sub-grade shall not be less than
8%, and k value (modulus of sub-grade reaction) not less than 50 MPa/m (or 0.05 N/mm 3 or
5 kg/cm 3
).
6.1.1
The concrete pavement
in FRC shall have a sub-base which may have single
or multiple layers. Sub-base may consists of dry lean concrete, cement treated sub-base,
existing bituminous/asphalt base etc.
In exceptional cases where the stiffness of the sub-
grade
is very
high, a drainage
layer,
with bituminous or cementitious
binder, should be
provided below FRC base (PQC) for the purpose of effective drainage of water. In conditions
of problematic sub-grade (like clayey soils) consideration of minimum thickness of road crust
will be considered.
6.1.1.1
At top of sub-base
(i.e. at bottom of PQC), the composite modulus of sub-grade
reaction (k value) shall not normally be less than 100 MPa/m (or 0.10 N/mm 3 or 10 kg/cm 3
).
This k value needed will be further higher as the thickness of PQC reduces.
6.1.2
The sub-grade
shall comply with the requirements
of IRC: 15 and
IRC:58.
Its
modulus of sub-grade reaction (i.e. lvalue) shall not be less than 50 MPa/m (or 0.05 N/mm 3
or 5.0 kg/cm 3
).
If k value is less than 80 MPa/m, a layer should be added over sub-grade (and
below sub-base) so as to improve the composite k value on that layer to at least 80 MPa/m
(or 0.08 N/mm 3 or 8 kg/cm 3
).
6.1 .3
While accounting for the k value as a design input, the value should be evaluated
such that
it
is a characteristic value
i.e. a reliable value which has very
little chance
(1
in
20) of being not exceeded. Hence in case of few test results,
it shall be the lowest possible
value.
It should be noted that k value changes from spot to spot due to heterogeneity (not
being perfectly uniform) of layers, deterioration over the design
life of the
rigid pavement
and moisture variations. While k value test
is done, usually for convenience of loading the
plate size taken
is smaller than the 750 mm diameter standard size. Due to smaller loaded
area the influence of the flexibility of lower layers of strata are not adequately accounted and
hence test value appears to be higher and need correction for the composite value. This
correction is in addition to plate size correction for a thick layer of one type of strata. Also with
load repetition or sustained load the stiffness reduces. Hence
it is necessary to arrive at the
design k value, after discounting the value estimated by test.
6.1.4
FRC pavement
layer,
if
not designed as bonded
or semi-bonded composite
pavement, a separation membrane shall be laid over the sub-base. Such a membrane has
two basic functions. The first
is to de-bond the base (PQC) from the sub-base and to allow
19



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
the top PQC layer to contract. At the joint, the horizontal movement of the slab
is about
1 mm due to temperature and shrinkage strain. The top surface of the sub-base should be
as per design profile and smooth to allow this movement.
If such a movement
is restricted
additional stress due to restraining of linear displacement will also be accounted in the design.
In normal design procedure as given
in IRC:58, such stress (due to restraining of linear
displacement)
is not accounted
in the design. Second function of the separation membrane
is the impermeability.
6.1.4.1
Impermeable membrane of virgin polyethylene (LDPE) as separation sheet, can
be used. Thickness should allow the movement between two layers. Hence
it will depend
upon the roughness of the top of sub base. Internationally polyethylene sheet
is not being
used, and geo-textile about 5 mm thick is recommended. Flexible bituminous layer (DBM-1
thickness about 50-75 mm) as a separation layer can also be provided to reduce the friction
to the contraction.
6.1.4.2
The separation layer (or sheet) may not be provided where joint spacing
is < 12
(15 for structural FRC) times the thickness of PQC even
if the PQC layer
is designed as
unbonded pavement.
6.1.5
For calculating the stress in PQC
in unbonded systems, the composite modulus
of sub-grade reaction (k value) at the bottom of the slab (PQC) is to be estimated as an input
value for design, which
is at top of sub-base as a composite action with the layers below.
This k value for design shall be evaluated by direct k value test or by estimate based on the
other test data as may be available, with correction for various conditions and variances. For
estimate the data from Table 2, 3 and 4 of IRC:58 (or IRC:15 Table 9, 10 and 11) may be
utilized.
6.1.5.1
For calculating the stress
in PQC
in bonded system, the composite modulus of
sub-grade reaction (k value) at the bottom of the composite slab (PQC + bonded sub-base)
i.e. at bottom of sub-base
is to be estimated as an input value for design. This composite
modulus of sub-grade reaction
(i.e. k value)
is at bottom of sub-base as a combined action
with the layers below, and determined as above (Clause 6.1.5).
6.1.6
For FRC pavement thickness 200 mm or more, use of load transfer devices (such
as dowel bars) may be considered, to reduce the stresses due to edge load. For pavement
thickness less than 200 mm such devices are considered as not reliable. Refer IRC:58 for
design of dowel and tie bars.
6.1.6.1
For pavement with structural FRC (/e150k ^ 0.3
/
ctk ), the thickness limit in above be
considered as 150 mm (in place of 200 mm).
6.1 .7
To control contraction cracking, longitudinal and contraction joints shall be designed
as per IRC:58 (for pavement without reinforcement bars).
Temperature Stress Shall be Estimated Similar to Plain Concrete Pavement.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
6.2
The design procedures for FRC pavement will change as its toughness increases.
Hence there are two different regimes for the design.
a)
FRC
having
low
dosages
of
fibres
or
less
effective
fibres,
exhibiting
/e i50k < 0-3 /ctk
,
i.e. toughness improvement
in FRC
is
not substantial,
or
/e150k not being specified.
b)
FRC having substantial toughness; this situation can be by using significant
dosages of effective fibres. Here
/
e150k > 0.3
/
ctk
. Values referred above will be
as per Clause 4.11, and determined as
in the test procedure described
in
Appendix B.
6.3
For
design,
modulus
of
elasticity
{E)
of the FRC
should
be
determined
as
tangent
modulus,
from
flexural
toughness
test
on
the beam
sample
as
specified
in
Appendix B. Alternately modulus of elasticity (E) could be determined from compression
test. In absence of E value from the test, based on the characteristic compressive strength of
concrete, E value can be taken as per the guidance in IRC:58.
6.3.1
For design, Poisson's
ratio
(fj) could be determined from compression
test.
In
absence of the value from test, /v value can be taken as per the guidance in IRC:58.
6.4
For bonded
overlays, the reduced thickness of FRC can be designed as per
IRC:SP:76.
6.5
The size of panel (between the joint) and the saw cut timing are important for
design.
6.6
In thin un-doweled overlays (white tops) the critical stress location
is the corner,
and the failure may be due to corner breaking and debonding.
7 DESIGN FOR FRC
Check on the design thickness of pavement as per provisions in Section 7 will be required for
all cases of FRC having low or high toughness.
7.1
Pavements with FRC of low toughness
(fe
^ 50k < 0.3 /ctk ),
shall be designed as
per the procedure given
in IRC:58, and where applicable using IRC:SP:76. The fibres are
taken to contribute mainly
in controlling plastic shrinkage and temperature induced cracks.
However, for fatigue endurance, the limiting stress ratio will be taken as specified below (in
place of 0.45
in IRC:58). Relationship of S-N
is given
in Appendix A for endurance limit of
0.50 and above.
7.1.1
The design value of peak flexural strength shall be conformed by the beam test
procedure given
in Appendix B.
If such
facilities are not available,
alternately
it can be
determined from flexural beam test conforming to IS:516.
7.1.2
In FRC
if polymeric fibres are used
in dose less than 0.3% by volume, for fatigue
endurance, the limiting stress ratio will be taken as 0.45 (as in IRC:58).
7.1.3
In FRC
if polymeric fibres are used
in dose more than 0.3% by volume (mainly to
control plastic shrinkage cracks), or in FRC with steel or any other fibres having low toughness
21



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
(falling under 6.2 (a), i.e./e150k < 0.3
/
ctk ), for fatigue endurance, the limiting stress ratio will be
taken as 0.50; see A1 of Appendix A.
7.2
Pavements with FRC having high toughness (falling under 6.2 (b) i.e./e150k > 0.3
/ctk ),
shall be designed as per the procedure given
in IRC:58. For fatigue endurance, the
limiting stress ratio will be taken as 0.6
(in place of 0.45
in IRC:58). Relationship of S-N
is
given in A2 of Appendix A for endurance limit of 0.60.
7.2.1
The fatigue endurance
limit of 0.7 can be used for design,
if test of the specific
FRC for fatigue data conform to the S-N relation for 0.7.
7.2.2
The design value of peak flexural strength shall be conformed by the beam test
procedure given in Appendix B.
7.2.3
In addition to the stress and fatigue damage check as in 7.1 and 7.2, the ultimate
moment capacity check as in Section 8 shall also be applied for FRC qualifying under 6.2(b)
and 7.2. The ultimate moment capacity check (as per Clause 8) will not be applicable to FRC
not qualifying under 6.2(b).
8 ULTIMATE MOMENT CAPACITY CHECK
For FRC having high toughness,
in addition to that the check as
in Section 7.2, following
check will be required on the design thickness of FRC pavement.
8.1
FRC pavement with high toughness, satisfying the requirements of 6.2 (b), shall
also be checked as per the provisions in this section, utilizing plasticity of FRC and nonlinear
analysis for the maximum design load. The design approach described here
is based on
yield line analysis (i.e. plastic structural response) of the pavement slab along the lines of the
procedure given by the UK Concrete Society TR 34.
8.2
Since ultimate load analysis considers the ultimate strength, instead of just the
first crack strength,
it seems to be generally acceptable for the design of slabs with fibres.
Consequently, some plastic behaviour can be assumed during the failure of such slab systems
(TR-34-2003). The structural design of FRC pavements subject to wheel loads involves a
two-step process of calculating the ultimate moments acting
for a given configuration of
maximum wheel loads followed by identifying the necessary resistance that must hold up to
the acting stresses.
8.3
Experimental studies on SFRC slabs have shown that the fibres do not have any
significant (for dosages normally used) influence on the first crack load and, therefore, do not
increase the cracking load. Nevertheless, the studies demonstrate that the ultimate failure
loads can be higher by up to 60% and that the key parameters governing the ultimate failure
loads are the sub-base reaction, fibre type and dosage.
It has been concluded that failure can
be considered as the appearance of a crack at the top of the slab (due to negative bending
moment).
In such a case, the stresses due to the positive moment, as shown
in Fig. 2, are
22



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
resisted by the cracked fibre concrete while the stresses due to the negative moment are
resisted by the uncracked concrete strength
i.e., the maximum stress would be the flexural
strength of SFRC.

Time of Initiation of First Crack at the Bottom (from TR 34-2003)
8.4
Therefore, the limit moment of resistance of the slab is calculated as M
= M +M
assuming
redistribution
of moments.
In the
limiting
condition,
both the
positive moment
of resistance (M
p
) and the negative moment of resistance (M n ) are considered
additive.
Accordingly, the relationship between the yielding moments for different loading cases,
in an
interior location
(i.e., away from the edges), can be written as:
^W(f)
...(5)
where P is the applied load, c
is the radius of the area under distributed load and
/
is the
elastic rigidity radius (i.e., radius of relative stiffness).
8.5
P = yf P
, where y, is the load factor with minimum value
1 .2
u
If
'
if
The radius of relative stiffness can be calculated as:
/=
E h5
-il/4
(6)
12
(1 - n
2
) k
Where E is the modulus of elasticity of concrete, \j is the Poisson's ratio of concrete, k is the
sub-grade modulus of reaction obtained as discussed
in Section 6.1, and h is the thickness
of the concrete slab.
8.6
The ultimate moment due to the load may be determined from any suitable inelastic
techniques
like the Meyerhofs
ultimate
load
analysis,
the Losberg's
yield
line analysis
or numerical analysis. However, the
applicability of inelastic analysis has to be ensured
with respect to the fibre dosage and type used since inadequate fibre or may not allow
enough plastic rotation capacity
in the slab to render inelastic analysis suitable for design.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 60
======================================================================
!RC:SP:46-2013
Consequently, inelastic design can be used only when /e150k > 0.3 /ctk
, where
/
e150k and f
are,
respectively the characteristic values of the equivalent flexural strength and flexural strength
of FRC determined using the procedure described in Appendix B.
8.7
The
required
residual
positive bending moment capacity
of the
slab can
be
represented as M
= (£150k
/ ym ) x {h2/6) and, since the fibres do not affect the
(first) cracking
stress, the negative moment capacity
is obtained as Mn =
(fctk
I ym
)x(/?2/6), where h
is the
thickness of slab. Strength values shall be divided by partial material factor to get the design
strengths. Hence
H = %k + /9 ,5o k)M1
2/6)/Ym
...(7)
Where ym
is the partial safety factor for concrete strength, for which the usual value would
be
1 to 12.

RESIDUAL FLEXURAL STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS TEST
B.1
Recommended procedure for the determination of flexural strength and equivalent
flexural strength of fibre reinforced concrete is given.
B.1.1
For drafting
this procedure, the JSCE-SF4 and ASTM C 1609 standards have
been used as the bases.
B.2
Scope
B.2.1
This appendix
provides the
guidelines
for testing and
evaluating the
flexural
strength and the equivalent flexural strength (as a measure of the toughness) of fibre reinforced
concrete by third point loading configuration on (un-notched) moulded test specimens. This
test method
is intended for fibres not longer than 60 mm. The method can also be used for a
combination of fibres of same or different materials.

: Test Set-up for Beam Test at Third Point Loading
Apparatus
B.6.1
Moulds: Standard beam moulds for producing hardened concrete specimens, of
non absorbent,
rigid material, not attacked by cement paste, of a size 150 mm * 150 mm
x 700 mm. Moulds of shorter length, of at least 550 mm long, can be used to decrease the
weight of the specimen.
B.6.2
Caliper, capable of reading the dimensions of test specimens to an accuracy of
0.1 mm.
B.6.3
Rule
(ruler/scale), capable of reading the dimensions of test specimens to an
accuracy of
1 mm.
B.6.4
It is recommended thatthe testing machine meets the machine class 1 requirements
in EN 12390-4, capable of operating
in a controlled manner,
i.e. producing a constant rate
31



======================================================================

IRC:SP:46-2013
of displacement (net deflection of specimen beam), and with
sufficient stiffness to avoid
unstable zones in the load-deflection curve.
B.6.5
If the testing is done in a machine with piston or crosshead (stroke) displacement
control,
it should be ensured that at least one data point is captured for a drop of 15% of the
peak load. This is to ensure that the load drop is not unstable just after the peak load in order
to establish a stable load-deflection curve.
B.6.6
Testing machines that use load control are not suitable for the test.
B.6.7
The loading and specimen support system shall be capable of applying third-point
loading to the specimen without eccentricity or torque. The fixtures normally used for flexural
testing are suitable with the qualification that supporting
rollers shall be able to rotate on
their axes and shall not be placed
in grooves or have other restraints that prevent their free
rotation (see Fig. B2).
Fig. B2
: Loading Arrangement for Test Specimen
B.6.8.1
It
is preferred that
all rollers shall be manufactured from steel and shall have a
circular cross-section with a diameter of 30 mm ±1 mm. They shall be at least 10 mm longer
than the width of the test specimen. They shall have a smooth and clean surface. The four
rollers (shown
in Fig. B2), including the two upper ones, shall be capable of rotating freely
around their axis. Except one roller at bottom, other three shall be capable of rotating
in a
plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the test specimen. For the requirements of
roller for supports or load, refer IS:9399.
B.6.8.2
The distance between the centers of the supporting rollers
(i.e. the span length)
shall be set equal to 450 mm ±1 mm. All rollers shall be adjusted to their correct position with
all distances within an accuracy of ±1 mm.
B.6.9
Load measuring device shall be capable of measuring loads to an accuracy of
10 N.

======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
B.6.10
Deflection measurement: Devices such as electronic transducers or electronic
deflection gages shall be located in a manner that ensures accurate determination of the net
deflection at the mid-span exclusive of the effects of seating or twisting of the specimen on
its supports. Accordingly two transducers or similar digital devices mounted on the yoke at
mid span, one on each side, to measure deflection through contact with appropriate brackets
(preferably S-shaped) glued onto the specimen
at the top surface and placed along the
vertical edges at mid span are recommended. The yoke has to be fixed using screw heads
placed at the level of mid depth of the specimen to ensure that the distance between the two
yoke frames do change during deflection of the specimen (see Fig. B2). The accuracy of the
transducers should be equal to or better than
1 micron.
B.6.11
Data recording system: A data acquisition system capable of digitally recording
and storing load and deflection data
1 0 times per second (i.e. a sampling frequency of 1 0 Hz)
is suitable.
B.6.12
Equipment: All weighing, measuring and testing equipment shall be calibrated
and
regularly inspected according
to documented
procedures,
frequencies and
criteria.
Devices for calibration (such as standard weights and measures, proving rings etc.) shall be
authenticated by competent authority and be certified.
B.7
Test Specimens
B.7.1
The specimen should have a cross sectional dimension of 150 mm
x 150 mm,
with a length between 550 to 700 mm. These dimensions are valid for concretes having
aggregates with maximum size of up to 25 mm and fibres of up to 60 mm in length.
B.7.2
The tolerances on the cross-sectional dimensions of the test specimens shall be
within ± 2%.
B.7.3
Preparation and curing of test specimens
B.7. 3.1
The procedure to be followed for filling the mould with fibre reinforced concrete
is indicated
in
Fig. B3; the quantity of concrete being added
in central portion
at a time
(increment
1 ) should be more than twice that of increment 2. The mould shall be filled fully in
the middle and approximately 90% of the height of the mould in end portions. The mould shall
be topped up and leveled while being compacted with minimum disturbance to the middle
portion. Compaction shall be carried out by external vibration and external tapping.

IRC:SP:46-2013
B.7.3.2
Only a high frequency vibrating tabie suitable for compaction of the concrete
in
the beam moulds shall be used. Care should be taken not to allow fibres to segregate (by
settling down/floating up) by too long a duration of vibration. Care shall be taken to avoid
realignment of fibres from the random nature.
B.7.3.3
In the case of self-compacting fibre concrete, the mould shall be filled and leveled
off without any compaction. External tapping can be used
if required.
B.7.4
Curing: The test specimens shall be cured according to
IS:51.6 (EN
12390-2),
unless specified otherwise. They shall be cured at (27 ±2)°C
in the moulds for 24 h after

shall normally be performed
at
28 days (or at the specified) age of the specimen.
B.7.5
During transportation of the specimens from field to test laboratory, care should be
taken to avoid jerks, heavy vibrations and damage to the surface.
B.8
Testing Procedure
B.8.1
Preparation and positioning of test specimens
B.8. 1.1
Average depth from the top to the bottom of the specimen and average width, for
sections at middle one third portion of the span (I/3 =
1 50 mm), shall be determined from four
measurements to the nearest 0.1 mm accuracy, using calipers. The width will be measured
at bottom, within middle one third portion of the span of beam.
B.8.1 .2
The test span
(I) shall be 450 mm.
B.8. 1.3
The test specimen must be turned on the side perpendicular with respect to the
position as cast before placing
it on the supports. The specimen shall be placed in the testing
machine, correctly centered and with the longitudinal axis of the specimen at right angles to
the longitudinal axis of the upper and lower rollers.
B.8. 1.4
The deflection measuring set up should be fixed as mentioned
in Section B.6.10
to avoid any extraneous deformations.
B.8. 1.5
Before applying the load
it shall be ensured that all loading and supporting rollers
are resting evenly against the test specimen.
B.8.2
Rate and range of loading
- The rate of loading should be so as to achieve the
peak load within 3 to 8 minutes of initiation of loading. Beyond the drop
in load after the
peak, the rate of loading can be increased so as to terminate the test in about 45 minutes.
In general the net deflection rate should be between 0.01 mm/min to 0.06 mm/min up to a
net deflection of about 0.1 mm and later about 0.1
to 0.24 mm/min. However, the optimum
rate of loading may be arrived at based on the response of the machine and the sensitivity
of the control system. The general deflection limit is 3 mm as for the majority of toughness
calculation equations the area under load-deflection curve up to a deflection of 1/150 mm are
required.

B.8.3
Tests during which the crack starts outside the middle third shall be rejected.
B.8.4
Normally, results from at least 6 specimens are required to obtain representative
values of the parameters. This may require that a set of at least 8 specimens be prepared for
testing purposes since the one or two specimens may fail
in an unstable manner or exhibit
cracking outside the middle third. However,
all test results shall be reported.

Calculation
B.9.1
All load and deflection data required for further calculations shall be obtained from
the digital data stored from the test.
B.9.2
Peak load (P max ) is obtained as peak value of load determined as the point where
the slope of the load- deflection curve is zero.
If two peaks are present or in the case of strain
hardening, the highest load within a deflection limit of 0.05 mm shall be taken as peak load.

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF FRC PAVEMENT DESIGN
Example 1
:
A Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) pavement
is to be designed
for a four lane divided
National Highway with two lanes in each direction in the state of Bihar. Design the pavement
for a period of 30 years; Lane width = 3.5 m, transverse joint spacing = 4.5 m.
It is expected that the road will carry,
in the year of completion of construction, about 3000
commercial vehicles per day
in each
direction. Axle load survey of commercial vehicles
indicated that the percentages of front single (steering) axle, rear single axle, rear tandem
axle and rear tridem axle are 45%, 15%, 25% and 15% respectively. The percentage of
commercial vehicles with spacing between the front axle and the
first rear axle less than
4.5 m is 55%. Traffic count indicated that 60% of the commercial vehicles travel during night
hours (6 PM to 6 AM).
Details of axle load spectrum of rear single, tandem and tridem axles are given in Table D.1.
Front (steering) axles are not included. The average number of axles per commercial vehicle
is 2.35 (due to the presence of multi-axle vehicles).

Solution for Example 1.
Since the design requirement is for a high traffic volume FRC pavement
( > 500 cpvd), fatigue
design
is needed in this case. The following steps detail the procedure followed.
a)
Selection of modulus of sub-grade reaction:-
o
Effective CBR of compacted sub-grade = 8%.
o
Modulus of sub-grade reaction - k- 50.3 MPa/m.
Provide DLC sub-base, thickness 1 50 mm with a minimum 7 day compressive
strength of 10 MPa
c
Effective
modulus
of
sub-grade
reaction
of
combined
foundation
of
compacted sub-grade and DLC sub-base (from Table 4 by interpolation) = k
= 285 MPa/m
o
Provide a de-bonding layer of polythene sheet between the DLC and the
FRC slab
b)
Selection of FRC properties
M 40 grade cement concrete
o
90-day mean compressive strength of cement concrete = fck = 52 MPa
o
Cold-drawn steel fibres with hooked ends having length of 60 mm and aspect
ratio of 80.
•
Dosage of steel fibres =
1 5 kg/m 3
•
28-day characteristic flexural strength = 4.7 MPa
•
90-day characteristic flexural strength =
1 .1 * 4.7 MPa = 5.2 MPa =fctk
o
Characteristic equivalent flexural strength
at 3 mm
deflection, fe150k -
1.6
MPa
c)
Design of FRC pavement using yield line analysis
•
Check for minimum equivalent flexural strength: 1.6 MPa > 0.3 * 3.13 MPa
(= 0.94 MPa). So, inelastic design method can be used.
The relationship between the yielding moments can be written as
:-
Mn +Mp
f
fa}
(D1)
where P is the total applied load, a is the radius of the area of load contact and
/ is the radius
of relative stiffness.
•
For single axle, as in this case, a
is given as:-
a=J^
...(D2)

======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:SP:46-2013
P = Load on one tyre = 190/2 kN = 95 kN (since the highest single axle load
is the critical case). Design load = 1.2 * 95 = 114 kN (load factor taken as
1.2),
i = Tyre pressure = 0.8 MPa
On substituting the above values, we get a = 238.

•
a// = 238.1/458 = 0.52, which
is greater than 0.2
•
Critical resisting moments will be the lower of those calculated for the single
wheel load at the centre of the slab and for the load at the edge of the slab.
Allowable load obtained from Meyerhof's
inelastic analysis
at the
limiting
moment in each case
is given by -

The maximum allowable load (the lower of the two) 201 kN > 114 kN
(i.e.,

load on one
tyre).
So,
the assumed dosage and thickness are
sufficient for the design failure load.
Check of Design Traffic for Fatigue Analysis:-
•
Design period = 30 years
•
Annual rate of growth of commercial traffic (expressed in decimal) = 0.075
•
Two way commercial
traffic volume per day = 6000 commercial vehicles/
day
•
Percent of Traffic in predominant direction = 50% (3000 CVs in each direction)
•
Total two-way commercial vehicles during design period,
C = 6000 x 365 x

0.075
= 226,444,692 CVs
... (D6)
Average number of axles (steering/single/tandem/tridem) per commercial
vehicle = 2.35
Total two-way axle load repetitions during the design period
= 226,444,692 * 2.35 = 532,145,025 axles

Column 1: Expected Repetitions (ni); Column 2: Flexural Stress MPa; Column 3: Stress Ratio
(SR); Column 4: Allowable Repetitions. (Ni); Column 5: Fatigue Damage factor (ni/Ni).
Flexural stress calculated using equation as per IRC:58-2011 Appendix V -
Eq n (V.13) for top down cracking with 0.66 as jS.
Cumulative fatigue damage analysis night-hours (6 hour) is given in Table D.5.
The total fatigue damage is computed from the above tables as>
•
For Bottom-Up Cracking (BUC) case: Total CFD = 0.37 + 0 = 0.37
•
For Top-Down Cracking (TDC) case: Total CFD = 0
•
Governing case of the two above is BUC with CFD = 0.37 < 1.00, which
is
OK.
Above tabulated in Table D.6.
Hence, the trial thickness of 240 mm is found to be adequate for pavement with concrete tied
shoulders.
FINAL DESIGN: Grade of concrete - M40
Thickness of slab = 240 mm
FRC with tied shoulders and doweled transverse joints.
Minimum fibre dosage 15 kg/m 3 for steel fibres 60 mm length and aspect ratio of 80

Required characteristic 28-day flexural strength = 3.14 MPa
Required characteristic 28-day equivalent flexural strength = 1.6 MPa
Fatigue design case 2:
FRC pavement without tied concrete shoulder and without dowel bars
(This case is chosen as
it is the most critical condition)
Trial thickness of slab, h = 0.3 m
(all lower values of h give inadequate design)
Radius of relative stiffness, = 0.701 m
•
Beta factor
((5)
in the stress equations will be 0.66 for doweled transverse
joints for carrying out TDC analysis
