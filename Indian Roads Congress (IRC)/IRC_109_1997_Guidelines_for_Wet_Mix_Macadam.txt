GUIDELINES FOR WET MIX MACADAM
1. INTRODUCTION
Conventional Water Bound Macadam (WBM) construction is generally
time consuming and manual, with
copious use of water. The other disadvantage
in WBM is that the segregation of aggregate takes place in the mix and the work
results in non-uniformity in the finished surface.
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM)
construction is an improvement upon the conventional WBM and is intended to be
as an alternative and more durable pavement layer.
It consists of clean, crushed,
graded aggregates premixed with other granular materials and water and rolled to
a dense mass on a prepared surface.
The draft document prepared by Flexible Pavement Committee was
discussed by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee in its meeting
held on
12th May,
1994 and
it was decided
that another 4raft prepared by
Mechanisation Committee on "Wet Mix Macadam" should be clubbed with this in
light of comments of members since both
these
items, pertained
to wet mix
macadam. Accordingly the above drafts were referred back to the newly constituted
Flexible Pavement Committee consisting of the following personnel for in-depth
study:

IRC: 109-1997
The above Committee
in us meeting held on 24th May, 1994 requested
Dr.L.R. Kadiyali to finali/e the draft on WMM
in light of the eommcnts made in
H.S.S. Committee on 12th May, 1994.
Accordingly, the draft has been finalised
by Dr. L.R. Kadiyali and was approved by the Flexible Pavement Committee in its
meeting held on 13lh February. 1996.
The
guidelines were
discussed
by
the Highways Standards and
Specifications Committee in its meeting held on l^th March, 1996.
It was decided
that guidelines would have two parts: Pan
I, would deal with the specification of
Wet Mix Macadam and Part II would cover the equipments lor WMM. With these
modifications, the draft was approved. The guidelines approved by the Executive
Committee in its meeting held on 17th April, 1996 was considered by the Council
in its meeting held on 24.5.96 at Darjeeling. The guidelines were approved by the
Council subject to the observations of the members, which should be considered
by the Executive Committee before
its publication.
As decided by the Executive
Committee
in
its meeting held on 4th September,
1996, the comments of the
members were duly examined by
Shri A. P. Bahadur,
in consultation with
the
Convenor of Flexible Pavement Committee. The modified draft was approved for
publication by the Executive Committee in its meeting held on 21.12.96.
PART I
: SPECIFICATIONS FOR WET MIX MACADAM
2
DESCRIPTION
Wet Mix Macadam
is
a pavement
layer wherein crushed graded
aggregates and granular material, like, graded course sand arc mixed with water in
mixing plant and rolled
to a dense mass on
a prepared surface.
It has many
advantages over the WBM
construction.
These
include superior gradation of
aggregate, faster rate of construction, higher standard of densification that can be
achieved, less consumption of water and stricter standards of quality achievable.
The specification can be adopted for sub-base and base courses. The work may be
done in many layers. The thickness of an individual layer shall not be less than 75
mm and can be upto 2(X) mm pro\ ided suitable type of compacting equipment is
used.
3. MATERIALS
3.1.
Aggregate
3.1.1.
Physical requirements: Coarse aggregates
shall be crushed
stone/crushed gravel/shingle, not less than 90 per cent by weight of gravel/shingle
pieces retained on 4.75 mm sieve and shall have at least two fractured faces. The
aggregates shall conform to the physical requirements set forth in Table 1.

IRC: 109-1997
If the water absorption value of the coarse aggregates is greater than 2 per
cent, soundness test shall be carried out on the material as per IS:2386 (Part V).

To determine the combined proportion of flaky and elongated particies, the flaky stone
from a representative sample should first be separated out.
Flakiness index is weight
of flaky stone metal divided by weight of stone sample. Only the elongated particles
be separated out from the remaining (Non -flaky) stone metal.
Elongation index
is
weight
of elongated
particles divided by
total non-flaky
particles.
The value of
flakiness index and.clongation index so found arc added up.
***
Requirement of 30 per cent can be relaxed upto35 percent (only) in cases where WMM
is to be used as sub base.
3.1.2.
Grading requirements: The aggregates
shall conform

The nominal size of aggregate to be used in a given case would depend
on availability.
While both the grading can be used for base/sub-base courses,
course using Grading No. 1 shall not be laid over the course using Grading No.2
The final gradation within the limits set forth in Table 2 shall be well
graded from coarse to fine and shall not vary from the lower limit on one sieve to
the higher limit on the adjacent sieve or vice versa.
4. CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS
4.1.
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
The work of laying of wet mix macadam shall not be done during rain.
4.2.
Preparation of Base
The surface of the sub-grade/sub-base/base to receive the WMM course
shall be prepared to the specified lines and cross-fall (camber) and made free of
dust and other extraneous matter. Any ruts or soft yielding places shall be corrected
in an approved manner and rolled until firm surface is obtained, if necessary by
sprinkling water.
As
far as
possible,
laying of WMM course over an existing
thick
bituminous layer may be avoided since it will cause problems of internal drainage
of the pavement at the interface of two courses.
It
is desirable to completely
excavate the existing thin bituminous wearing course where WMM is proposed to
be laid over
it. However, where the intensity of rain
is low (less than 1300 mm),
and the interface drainage is efficient, WMM can be laid over the existing thin
bituminous surfacing by cutting 50 mm x 50 mm furrows at an angle of 45 degrees
to the center line of the pavement at one meter intervals on the existing road. The
directions and depth of furrows shall be such that they provide adequate bondage
and also serve to .drain water to the existing granular base course beneath the
existing thin bituminous surface.
4.3.
Provision
of Lateral Confinement of Wet Mix
While constructing WMM, arrangement shall be made for the
lateral
confinement of wet mix. This shall be done by laying materials adjoining shoulders
alongwith that of wet mix layer. The sequence of operations shall be such mat the
construction of the shoulder is done in layers each matching the thickness of the
adjoining pavement layer. Only after a layer of pavement and corresponding layers
in shoulder have been laid and compacted, the construction of the next layer of
pavement and shoulder shall be taken up.

======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 28
======================================================================
IRC: 109-1997
4.4.
Preparation of Mix
WMM shall be prepared in an approved mixing plant of suitable capacity
having provision
for controlled addition of water and forced/positive mixing
arrangement, like, pugmill or pan type mixer. For small quantity of wet mix work,
mixing may be done
in ordinary concrete mixers.
The Specifications and
requirements for equipment for WMM are discussed in Part II. The equipment
should conform to requirements detailed in Part II.
Optimum moisture for mixing shall be determined in accordance with
IS:2720 (Part VIII), after replacing the aggregate fraction retained on 19 mm sieve
with material of 4.75 to 19 mm size. However, the OMC and required number of
passes to achieve the desired density may be determined at site during proof rolling,
using the roller selected for compaction. While adding water, due allowance should
be made for evaporation losses. However, at the time of compaction, water in the
wet mix should not vary by more than ± 1 per cent
4.5.
Spreading of Mix
Immediately after mixing, the mixed material shall be transported to site
and spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared subgrade/sub-base/base in
required quantities.
Hauling of the mix over a freshly completed stretch is not
permitted.
The mix may be spread either by a paver finisher or motor grader or a
combination of both.
However, the use of paver finisher should be preferred to
motor grader for spreading. For portions where mcchanica) means cannot be used,
manual method of spreading can be adopted. The equipment used for spreading
shall be capable of spreading the material uniformly all over the surface.
Its blade
shall have hydraulic controls suitable for initial adjustments and maintaining the
same so as to achieve the specified slope and grade.
The paver finisher shall be self-propelled, having the following features:-
i)
leading hoppers and suitable distributing mechanism
it)
The
screed
shall
have tamping and
vibrating
arrangement
for
imparting
initial
compaction
to the
layer as
it
is spread without
nitting or otherwise disturbing the
surface profile.
lii)
'l"he paver shall beequipped with necessary control mech.mism soas toensure that the
unfinished surface
tree from surface blemishes.
The
surface
of
the
layer as
spread
shall
be
carefully checked
with
templates and
all high or low spots remedied by removing or adding wet mix
5

IRC: 109-1997
material as may be required. Tlie layer thickness may be checked by depth blocks
during construction. No segregation of coarse or fine particles shall be allowed.
The layer as spread shall be of uniform gradation and shall not have pockets of fine
materials.
4.6.
Compaction
After
the mix
has been
laid
to the required
thickness, grade and
cross-fall/camber, the same shall be uniformly compacted to the full depth with a
suitable roller.
If the thickness of the single compacted layer docs not exceed 100
mm, a smooth wheel roller of 80 to 100 kN weight may be used. For compacting
single layer of higher thickness upto 200 mm, the compaction shall be done with
the help of vibratory roller of minimum 80-100 kN static weight or equivalent
capacity to achieve the desired density. The speed of roller shall not exceed 5km/hr.
In portions having uni -directional cross-fall/superelevation, rolling shall
commence from the lower edge and progress gradually towards the upper edge.
Thereafter roller should progress parallel to the center line of die road, uniformly
over-lapping each preceding track by at least one-third width until the entire surface
has been rolled upto the centre
line. The process of compaction
is then to be
repeated from the other edge of the pavement upto die centre line, until the entire
pavement is compacted. Any displacement occurring as a result of reversing of
the direction of a roller or from any other cause shall be corrected.
Along forms, kerbs, walls or other places not accessible to the roller, die
mix shall be thoroughly compacted with mechanical tampers or a plate compactor.
Skin patching of an area without scarifying the surface to permit proper bonding
of the added material shall not be permitted.
Rolling should not be done when the subgrade is soft or yielding or when
it causes
a
wave-like motion
in
the sub-base/base course
or sub-grade.
If
irregularities develop during rolling which exceed 12 mm when tested with a 3
meter straight edge, the surface should be loosened and premixed material added
or removed as required before rolling again so as to achieve a uniform surface
conforming
to the desired grade and cross-fall.
In no case should the use of
unmixed material be permitted to make up the depressions.
Rolling shall be continued
till the density achieved is atlcast 98 per cent
of the maximum dry density for the material as determined by the method outlined
in IS:2720 (Part VIII).
After completing,
the
finished
surface
shall
present
a
well-closed
appearance, free from movement under compaction equipment or any compaction
marks,
ridges, cracks and
loose
material.
All
loose, segregated or otherwise
6

shall
be made good

full
thickness of
the
layers and
recompacted.
Longitudinal joints and edges shall be constructed true to the delineating
line parallel to the centre line of the road.
All longitudinal and transverse joints
shall be cut vertical to the full thickness of the previously laid mix before laying
the fresh mix.
4.7.
Important Considerations in Construction Process
While due care and attention is required on the whole process of WMM
construction, the following are important points needing more attention:-
i)
Sometimes because of moisture in the fines, these will not flow out from the bin of the
three-bin feeder to the belt.
In such situation,
it would be necessary to have a «mall
vibrator fitted on one of the side walls of the bin to intermitently shake it.
li)
Control on water in the mix is of utmost importance; hence there should not be any
variation in the grading, particularly of fines as it will effect the moisture content and
uniform mixing.
Similarly, excessive fluctuations in the moisture content of the fines
should be avoided.
If necessary, slight increase may be made in the moisture contents
to account for the moisture loss in transit to the laying site.
iii)
Excessive sill or clay in fines should not be permitted, as besides spoiling the quality
of mix,
it will cause clogging in pugmil and storage silo.
iv)
The mixed material should be transported
directly to
site.
Stockpiling of mixed
materia] should be discouraged as excessive handling is the cause of segregation and
moisture loss, both of which arc detrimental to the quality of the wet mix macadam.
v)
There should be minimum joints in laying wet mix macadam. Toensure this, the daily
output should
at least be 500 linear meters.
The width of laving also should be so
adjusted to avoid the necessity of laying narrow strips e.g. against kerbs.
vi)
Single paver of 7m width or two pavers each of 3.5m width working in tandem within
the short distances should be used for obtaining good results.
4.8.
Setting and Drying
After final compaction of the wet mix macadam course, the road shall be
allowed to dry for 24 hours before overlaying with any bituminous layer.
5. OPENING TO TRAFFIC
No vehicular traffic except construction vehicles shall be allowed on the
finished WMM surface till the subsequent bituminous course is laid.

6. SURFACE
FINISH AND QUALITY CONTROL OF WORK
6.1.
The surface levels of a wet mix layer laid as a sub-base shall have a
tolerance of not more than +
1 0mm and -20mm from the designed longitudinal and
cross profile. When laid as a base course with machines, the tolerance shall be
+ 10mm and -10mm.
For checking compliance with this, surface levels shall be
taken on a grid of points placed 6.25 m longitudinally and 3.5 m transversely. For
any 10 consecutive measurements taken longitudinally or transversely, not more
than one measurement shall be permitted to exceed the above tolerances, thus one
measurement being not in excess of 5mm above the permitted tolerance.
6.2.
The longitudinal profile shall also be checked by a 3 meter straight edge
at the middle of each traffic lane along a line parallel to the centre line of the road.
The maximum allowable difference between the road surface and underside of a 3
meter straight edge shall be 8 mm.
The frequency of the Quality Control tests shall be as under:
1.
Gradation
One Test per 200 m
3
2.
Plasticity Index
One test per 200 m
3.
Moisture Content prior to compaction
One test per 250 m*
4.
Density of compacted layer
One test per 500 m
5.
Aggregate Impact Value or lx>s
Angeles Abrasion Value
One test per 500 m
6.
Hakincss and Elongation Index
One lest per 500 m
6.3.
For testing the compaction requirements, test locations shall be chosen
only through random sampling techniques. Control shall not be based on the result
of any one test but on the mean value of 5-10 density determinations. The number
of tests in one set of measurements shall be 6 (if non -destructive tests are carried
out, the number of tests shall be doubled) as long as it is felt that sufficient control
over the constituent materials forming the mix is being exercised.
If considerable
variations
i.e.
1 5% and above arc observed between individual density results, the
minimum number of tests in one set of measurement shall be increased to 10. The
acceptance criteria shall be subject to the condition that the mean density of a set
of measurement shall not be less than the specified density plus:
1.65
1.65 —
X
standard deviation
\J (So. of samples)
6.4.
Rectification of Surface Irregularity
Where the surface irregularity of the layer as laid exceeds the permissible
tolerances or where the course is otherwise defective due to subgrade soil getting
mixed with the aggregates, the full thickness of the layer shall be scarified over the

affected area reshaped with added premix material or removed and replaced with
fresh premix material and recompacted. The area treated in this manner shall not
be less than 5 m long and 2 m wide. In no case shall depressions be filled up with
unmixed and ungraded material or fines.
7. MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT
Wet mix macadam shall be measured as finished work in position in cubic
meters.
PART n
: EQUIPMENT FOR WET MIX MACADAM
8. CONSTRUCTION PROCESS
The construction process of wet mix macadam involves the following
sub-activities:-
i)
Production of aggregates in required sizes.
li)
Proportioning of aggregates and mixing with water.
in)
Transportation of mix.
iv)
Spreading and laying.
v)
Compaction.
The whole process should be such that methods adopted and equipment
used meet the laid down requirements ofend result specifications in respect of sizes
and grading of aggregates, optimum moisture content, proper mixing, laying in
uniform thickness to the correct profile and required compaction.
9. EQUIPMENT NEEDS
The equipment requirement for WMM is simple. Most of the equipment
needed for other activities like stone crushers, tippers, motor grader, paver and
vibratory roller can be used for this work too. Few additional equipment can Jbe a
three-bins feeder, pugmill etc.
For some work more than one type of equipment
can be used. The pros and cons of some of these are discussed below alongwith
the activity-wise requirement.
10. PRODUCTION OF AGGREGATES
Multi-stage stone crushing and vibratory screening plant installed for
obtaining aggregates for bituminous courses can easily meet the requirement of
wet mix macadam.
Wider variation
in the quantities of different fractions are
permissible in some cases.

PROPORTIONING OF AGGREGATES AND MIXING
11.1.
Proportioning and mixing can be done in different ways depending on the
total methodology of work adopted.
11.2.
Concrete Mixer
For small quantities of WMM, concrete mixer can be used for production
of mix and different fractions can be added by box measurement as in the case of
manual feeding of mixer for producing concrete.
In this method, the usual facility
of measuring water is a overhead tank which will not be very accurate.
Further,
because of limitations such as the size and capacity of mixer, manual feeding and
non-continuous production of mix makes, mis method is unsuitable for large scale
work.
11.3.
Batching and Mixing Plant
11.3.1.
In order to obtain uniform WMM material using batch plant, only pan
type mixing plant should be used, since it provides the force mixing of the different
constituents of the mix. The mixing time may have to be increased for more uniform
dispersal of low water content in the mix. Blending of aggregates and mixing can
be achieved through storage bins and weigh hoppers.
11.3.2.
Bin
feeder & pugmill
For continuous production of mix in a pugmill in sufficient quantity, the
best way to feed the aggregates and control the grading is by means of a 3 or 4 bins
feeder with belt conveyor.
It is similar to the bin feeder of a hot mix plant but
without variable speed motors and load sensor as the required grading can be
achieved with the adjustment of gate openings itself. Such a unit consisting of 3
or 4 bins feeder, belt conveyors, pugmill and water pump arrangement is the most
suitable equipment for production
of wet mix macadam. A typical layout of 60
tons per hour capacity plant is given at Annexure I.
1 1 .3.3.
Important features
:
The following arc some of the important features
to be kept in view
:
i)
Under each bin, there should he an adjustable quadrant gate and bell feeder to regulate
the aggregate supply.
ii)
Giggli screen should be provided over the coarse aggregate bins to exclude oversize
material, if any.
iii)
A surface vibration should be provided on the outside of the sand/fines bin to maintain
uniform flow.
iv)
Belt feeder, gathering conveyors and secondary conveyor should have independent
motors.

v)
The angle of inclination of secondary conveyor should not be more than 19 degrees.
v{)
The twin-shaft pugmill should have replaceable inner liner plates.
vii)
The clearance between the tips of the paddles and liners should be less than maximum
stone size so that the aggregates are pushed forward while mixing. This type of paddles
should be adjustable so that clearance can be set according to maximum size of
aggregate.
The mixing of aggregates and water is done in a continuous twin-shaft
pugmill or paddle mixer.
Unlike a drum mixer where mixing
is achieved by
rotation of the drum and flights inside it, there is forced action-mixing in a pugmill
which is better for uniform coating of film of moisture. As such the use of Drum
Mix Plant is not suitable for producing WMM. The controlled amount of water is
added in the pugmill by a spray bar with the help of a variable speed pump and a
flow meter.
This arrangement provides a precise control on the quantity of water
which is very critical for the success ofWMNfconstruction. In this method, feeding
of aggregates, addition of water and mixing are continuous operations. The mix
can be either directly discharged into the tipping truck or taken through a belt
conveyor to a storage silo.
It is advantageous to have a storage silo, as it helps in
continuous production of mix even when no tipping truck is readily available for
loading.
Also loading of tipper through storage silo takes less time. Thus there
will be saving in the number of tipping trucks required.
Transportation of mix
is usually done by tipping trucks.
In order to avoid moisture loss in transit due to evaporation, mix should
be covered with Tarpaulin.
For this job, there arc two clear alternatives in the choice of equipment.
These are motor grader and paver finisher. Both these are suitable for thVwork.
Advantages and disadvantages of paver finisher and motor grader are
detailed below:

b)
Better control of thickness
and profile of the layer.
b)
Wear & tear of auger
and chain are frequent;
as such maintenance
cost
is high.
c)
Paver has the facility of
precompacting the layer and
hence the surface finish is
better.
c)
" Maximum gap between
auger and side plate
should not be more
than
1 5cm, otherwise
the spaces will have
to be
till manually, which
in turn will not be
properly compacted
leading to difficulty
in maintaining the
levels.
d)
Initial cost of the mechanical
paver is low.
e)
No wastage of wet mix macadam
while laying as there is no
side flow of the mix.
ii)
Grader
Advantage
Disadvantage
a) Faster to work
b) Can work on slightly imper-
fect sub-grade.
c) Require less maintenance.
d) Heavy tyres helping consoli-
dating material in depressions
and the layers.
a)
Less accurate in
profile and surface finish.
b)
Waste of material is
high due to side
slippage of the mix.
c)
I>ack of uniformity and
proper levelling of
layers.
d)
Initial cost of motor-
grader is very high.
e)
Mix is dumped in heaps
before spreading by the
grader which is
against the
specification
of the methodology.
0
An efficient grader
operator is required
to spread the material
properly. There is
segregation of the
particles when the mix
is dumped in heaps.
