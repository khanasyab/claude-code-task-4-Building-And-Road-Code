1.2.
At its first meeting on 29* April, 2003,
the Committee felt that in the light of the massive
construction programme that was under execution
in the highway sector,
it was necessary to bring
out guidelines on certain topics which were not
adequately covered in the existing IRC Codes and
Standards. The use of external and unbonded
prestressing tendons in bridge structures was one
of the topics selected.
It was decided that while
highlighting the special design and detailing
requirements in each case, the guidelines would
be generally in hne with IRC: 18 and IRC:21 with
additional inputs from BS:5400, EURO and
AASHTO codes, wherever necessary.
1.3.
The initial draft of the guidelines was
prepared by Shri P Y. Manjure and revised by Shri
S.G. Joglekar. The draft was discussed by the B-
6 Committee at several meetings and finalized in
its meeting held on 5"" November, 2004. The draft
document was approved by Bridges Specifications
and Standards Committee in its meeting held on
20"" December,
2004. The document was
considered by IRC Council in its
173"* meeting
held on
8"" January, 2005
in Bangalore and
approved without modifications.
2.
SCOPE
The guidelines contain the additional and/or
alternative considerations covering the design
aspects, prestressing systems, materials, protection
of steel, durability aspects and also, describe few
details of the applications. The Designer is advised
to consult relevant specialist literature on the
subject, if further information is needed.
3.
UNBONDED PRESTRESSING
-
APPLICATION
There are three types of applications
(i)
In the first type, the unbonded prestressing
1



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:67-2005
elements on their own comprise the total
prestressing
force.
Segmentally
constmcted bridge superstructures using
external cables is an example of this type.
(ii)
In the second type, the unbonded elements
act as part of total prestressing force, the
other part being provided by bonded
prestressing elements embedded
in
concrete. External prestressing provided
for repair/rehabilitation/strengthening of
existing prestressed concrete bridges is an
example of this type. The external
prestress may or may not contiibute to the
enhancement of ultimate strength.
(iii) In the third type, the external prestressing
is used as a means of applying external
load acting in the desired direction and
quantum, and the deformation of the
structure due to subsequent live load -
both
in service and under ultimate
condition - do not affect the magnitude
and direction significantly. The external
prestressing
is taken as equivalent load
only without considering its contribution
to the strength of the structure. Such is
the method of strengthening of RCC
structures by using prestressing elements
to relieve part of the dead load effects.
In unbonded prestressing, no continuous bond
is provided between the prestressing elements and
concrete, by virtue of which concrete and
prestressing
steel
can develop
structural
interaction.
In these structures prestressing
elements are outside the concrete section and are
attached to it at discrete points of anchorages and
deviators. The prestressing elements and the
concrete elements behave as different component-
structures of the overall structure, acting in unison
by virtue of connection
at anchorages and
deviators, and thereby contribute
to overall
strength. The local strains in any part can be
calculated by
first calculating the overall
deformations,
i.e., relative displacements of
common points of attachment and then analyzing
the component-structures separately.
It is possible to use unbonded prestressing
elements which lie within the ducts provided in
concrete section, and thereby impose closely
matching geometrical deflections on the two. Such
solutions have been used where long term
monitoring of prestressing force and/or possible
replacement of cables, or augmentation of the
force
at
a
later date had been the design
requirement. However, for these cases also, the
local
strains in concrete and the prestressing
tendons are not identical.
4.
MATERIALS
'
4.1.
Prestressing Steel
Prestressing steels listed in Clause 3.5.1 of
IRC: 18-2000 are acceptable. In addition, factory
produced protected
steels, such
as, galvanised,
epoxy coated, lubricated and sheathed steel strands
(in HDPE sheaths) are acceptable. For full
specifications, relevant Indian Standards, or in
absence of the same. International Standards
should be referred
to. However,
steel material
should pass the requirements of IRC: 18-2000
Clause 3.5.1.
4.2.
Sheathing
External tendons shall be housed in either High
Density Poly-Ethylene (HDPE) sheaths or metaUic
steel sheaths (plain or with protective coatings),
which have smooth internal surfaces. The
sheathing ducts and connections should be fully
leak-tight against water pressure equivalent to 1
.
1
X (maximum expected gravity head of grouting
material + grouting pressure). The jointing
specifications and details should also be leak-tight
and pressure resisting as above.
The materials of sheaths shall meet requirements
of respective Indian Standards/IRC Standards.
4.3.
Deviators,
Anchorage
Brackets,
Suspenders
These items can be in R.C.C./P.S.C. forming
parts of the main structure or in steel which is
embedded therein or fixed to the same by
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:67-2005
anchoring or by mechanical fixing arrangement
(e.g., by bolting or welding).
The steel fasteners, welding materials,
etc.
used for fabrication of such parts shall be conforming
to IRC :24-200 1 . The materials and reinforcing steels
used
in R.C.C. portion
shall be as per the
requirements of IRC : 2 1 -2000.
4.4.
Anchorages, Guide-tubes and All
Parts of Prestressing System
Anchorages should preferably be of replaceable/
or re-usable type for possible replacement of tendon.
Anchorage systems should be factory
manufactured under strict quality assurance/quality
control, and supplied in appropriately protective
packing. These items being of proprietary nature,
their manufacturers should be got approved from
competent authorities. The supplied product itself
should be subjected to acceptance testing for
satisfactory performance of the same. Guidelines
for acceptance testing may be taken from *FIB
guideUnes orfromBritish Standards ^BS:4447-1973
(Reprinted in 1990).
Attention
is
specially brought
to
the
requirement of passing dynamic test for two million
cycles for the cable/anchorage assembly when
tested
in accordance with FIB
or BS
test
procedure. Certificate of testing by independent
testing laboratory using the assemblies similar to
those proposed for the work in hand is a minimum
level of acceptance for
all applications. These
should be supplemented by testing of not less than
three samples from the materials supplied to site.
5.
DESIGN
5.1.
General
The provisions of IRC:6-2000, IRC: 18-2000
and IRC:2 1-2000, for design are also applicable
for bridges with unbonded prestressing steel except
as discussed hereinafter. Although not explicitly
stated in codes, the prestressing is treated partly
as load and partly as a component of load-resisting
mechanism (i.e., adding to the strength of section).
When treated as load, it is treated as a permanent
load varying between prestress level before losses
and after long-term losses, with further provision
that losses themselves can vary ±20 per cent from
the mean design value. This method of design is
used in "working load" or "allowable stress" method
of design. When this method is supplemented (as is
done in IRC: 18-2000) by additionally stipulating
rninimum required ultimate strength equal to or greater
than that required by "factored load combinations"
the contribution of prestressing steel in ultimate
resistance of section needs to be considered.
Note: In Limit State Design method, both
Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Serviceability
Limit State (SLS) need to be checked for which
detailed rules are given
in codes using Limit
State Philosophy for design. The requirements
of IRC: 18-2000 for ULS checking, need to be
supplemented by suitable strength models to
cover the case of external and unbonded
prestress.
- Refer Section 4.4.3. & Appendix.
5.2.
Load,
Load
Combinations
and
Factored
Loads
For
Ultimate
Strength Requirements
Provisions of IRC:5-1998, IRC: 18-2000 and
IRC:2 1-2000 are applicable.
The prestressing load
is taken
to vary
between limits as described in 5.1 above. By
implication the load factor for ultimate load on
prestress
is taken as
1.0
in IRC: 18-2000.
However, IRC: 18 does not cover indeterminate
structures. For such structures, a load factor of
1.2 for unfavourable combinations and 0.9 in
favourable combinations
is recommended for
analysing
the response
of indeterminate
structures and establishing required ultimate load
resistance at different sections.
5.3.

======================================================================

IRC:SP:67-2005
the sections should be limited to their additional
strength beyond prestressing. This may be
calculated assuming that the origin of the stress/
strain relationship of the tendon
is displaced
by the effects of prestressing (Refer Fig.l and
Fig. 2).
5.3.2.
Section analysis
: In absence of detailed
rules
(in IRC: 18) for estimating the ultimate
resistance in bending of sections with unbonded
prestress, set of rules consistent with principles of
5.3.1 above are given
in Appendix for ready
reference.
In members where partial prestress
is
provided by bonded tendons, the shear resistance
should be checked as prestressed member (with
bonded prestress), treating
the unbonded
prestress to provide only the external axial force
as stated above. Where shear capacity itself is
directly provided by - or augmented by - external
unbonded prestress, the partial load-factor for
prestressing load in total shear in ultimate load
combination should be taken
as
0.9.
Its
contribution to strength by further elongation
should be neglected since additional strains by
shear deformations are small.
5.3.3.
Resistance to shear
: Calculations for
shear are required only for ultimate strength.
Sections with
full prestressing provided by
unbonded or external tendons shall be checked
for shear by considering them as reinforced
concrete sections subject to externally applied axial
load (such as columns).
5.3.4.
Design ofAnchorages/Deviator/Local Zone
(i)
For external cables, the anchorages are
normally external and the tendons may
be required to be re-stressed or replaced.
Also, anchorages have to be able to hold
cables in stressed condition for the design
life. Hence, the anchorages and

components should be suitable to meet
these requirements.
(ii)
Anchorages, deviators, the supporting
brackets, projecting concrete blisters, etc.
should be designed for carrying
full
nominal ultimate capacity of tendon as a
design load.
(iii) The load transmitted to concrete section
by these elements should be resisted by
appropriately designed and reinforced
local zone of the main structure to which
they are affixed. The spalling and bursting
reinforcement shall not be less than that
recommended by the manufacturer of
anchorages. The zones immediately

IRC:SP:67-2005
behind the anchorage (and zone in front
and sides of
it in case of intermediate
anchorages) should be properly reinforced
taking into account the effects of dispersal
of load in the concrete section.
(iv) The design of the deviators, in steel or in
concrete, shall meet the requirements of
IRC: 18, IRC:21 and IRC:24 as apphcable.
6.
DETAILING
6.1.
Alignment of External Cables
The tendons can be straight or draped using
deviators depending on the particular requirements.
Various profiles can be adopted to suit the required
combination of axial load and bending. Careful
consideration should be given to the overall stress
distribution at critical sections and the local stresses
at points of anchorages and deviators.
Some of the commonly adopted shapes for
alignment are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Typical
arrangements of deviators are shown in Fig. 5 and
Fig. 6. Typical details of anchorages often adopted
in repair/rehabilitation works are shown in Fig. 7.
For new works, normal embedded types of
anchors or specially manufactured anchors for
external application are used.
6.2.
Straight Lengths Between Deviators
Only in case of embedded ducts, non-linear
geometrical shapes can be provided for unbonded
tendons. Otherwise, alignment of external cables
will be in straight segments between points of
attachment to the structure, such as, anchorages,
deviators, etc.
For straight cables, the spacing of deviators
and anchorages shall be such that the straight
segments of cable are not longer than 12 times
the depth of the beam or 12 m whichever is less.
An intermediately placed deviator intended to
break the long
straight length shall project
outwards beyond theoretical straight line joining
the deviators on two sides to ensure that the
tension in the tendon will keep
it fully pressed
against the intermediate deviator and keep the
tendon in place by friction. Also at all deviators
tendons should be restrained against
lateral
movement. In all cases, the natural frequency of
tendons with lengths held between the points of
fixing should not be in range of 0.8 to 1.2 times
the natural frequency of bridge element to which
external cables are fixed. The natural frequency
of tendon is a function of its effective mass per
unit length rigidly attached to the tendon, it's stress
level and the distance between the points of
attachment. It is given by

6.3.
Curvature at Deviators
In the absence of test results or other
investigation justifying smaller values, the radius
of curvature of tendons in the deviators should
not be less than the values as specified in Table 1

CALCULATION OF ULTIMATE MOMENT OF RESISTANCE
A-l(l) When analysing
a cross-section
to
determine
its ultimate
strength, the
following assumptions should be made:
a)
The strain distribution in the concrete in
compression
is
derived
from
the
assumption that plane sections remain
plane.
b)
The
stresses
in
the
concrete
in
compression are derived either from the
stress-strain curve with design strength
equal to 2/3 of f
value. This is further
reduced dividing by
}'
= 1.5, where y
^
-'
'
III
'in
is material strength reduction factor for
concrete. The
strain
at the outermost
compression fibre is taken as 0.0035.
c)
The tensile strength of the concrete
is
ignored.
d)
The strains in bonded prestressing tendons
and in any additional reinforcement,
whether in tension or compression, are
derived from the assumption that plane
sections remain plane. In addition, the
tendon will have an initial strain due to
prestress after all losses.
e)
The stresses
in bonded prestressing
tendons, whether initially tensioned or
untensioned,
and
in
additional
reinforcement, are derived from the
appropriate stress-strain curves, with y ^
=
1.15, where
y
is material strength
'
111
reduction factor for steel.
f)
The strain in unbonded tendons shall be
assumed not to increase above the initial
value due
to prestress after
all losses
including y
except that either.
i)
In slabs and beams, the strain in the
mid- span region of cables which are
within O.ld of the soffit at mid-span
and which do not extend beyond the
supports may be taken to increase by
0.0005, with no additional calculation.
ii)
The strain in the tendons at failure may
be calculated from
a non-linear
analysis oi the structure. If this is done,
checks shall be made to ensure that
conventional
"conservative"
assumptions, such as, ignoring the
tensile strength of concrete, do not
have the effect of increasing the tendon
strain and hence the ultimate strength.
g)
Tendons and reinforcing bars which are
anchored within a distance equal to h/2
of the section being considered shall be
ignored. However, within h/2 of a simply
supported end,
all prestress which
is
anchored "beyond the centre-line of the
support may be considered effective.
