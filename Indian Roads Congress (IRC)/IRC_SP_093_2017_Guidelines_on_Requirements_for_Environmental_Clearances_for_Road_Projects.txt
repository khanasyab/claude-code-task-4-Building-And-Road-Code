CHAPTER 1
ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK
1.1	
Preamble
The document on Environmental Clearance was first published in 2011. Since then a number 
of changes were brought about by the Government limiting the usefulness of the document. 
It was, therefore, felt necessary that the document be revised and made consistent with the 
current regulations on the subject. Some of the changes triggering the revision are: relaxed 
norm of project length requiring environmental clearance from 30 km to 100 km and width of 
additional land acquisition from 20 m to 40 m for widening and 60 m for realignment. Some 
other provisions relaxed in the meantime include de-linking of various clearance processes 
such as; environment & CRZ clearance, forest clearance and wildlife clearance and parallel 
processing of all clearances such as processing of forest clearances de-linked from wildlife 
clearance for activities falling beyond the boundary of protected area (ESZ), dispensing with 
the requirement of specific TORs for highway widening projects; delegation of powers of 
issuing forest clearance for linear projects to Regional Offices on the recommendation of 
Regional Empowered Committees (RECs) and treating the First Stage Forest Clearance as 
working permission for cutting of trees and commencement of work subject to funds meeting 
the statutory conditions being deposited, advisory to the State Governments not to impose 
additional conditions over and above those stipulated in the Forest Clearance; waiver of 
taking the consent of Gram Sabhas under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 for linear projects on 
the Collector’s certificate that no population of tribal or forest dwellers are affected; borrowing 
of earth not attracting environment clearance, etc. Hon’ble Supreme Court has also dispensed 
with the requirement of filing an application before the Court for Wildlife Clearance if CEC has 
no objection on the recommendation of SCNBWL.
1.2	
Environment and Social Legal Framework
Even before India’s Independence in 1947, several environmental and social/resettlement 
related legislations existed but the real impetus for bringing about a well-developed framework 
came only after the UN Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972). Under 
the influence of this declaration, the National Council for Environmental Policy and Planning 
within the Department of Science and Technology was set up in 1972. After the Stockholm 
Conference, in 1976, constitutional sanction was given to environmental concerns through 
the 42nd Amendment, which incorporated them into the Directive Principles of State Policy 
and Fundamental Rights and Duties. The Department of Environment was established 
in 1980 and later evolved into a full-fledged Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) 
in 1985, which was renamed as the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change 
(MoEFCC) in 2014, and is the apex administrative body in the country for regulating and 
ensuring environmental protection.
The legal environment framework of the country consists of several Acts, notifications, rules 
and regulations to protect environment and wildlife.

1.3	
Regulatory Control of Road Projects
Environment Clearance is required only for certain categories of Highway Projects, and not 
all road projects. However, other Environmental Clearances may be required for all road 
projects, depending on location of the project alignment.
1.4	
Enforcement Agencies for Environmental Regulations
1.4.1	
Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC)
The Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEFCC) is the key ministry of 
the Government of India (GoI) responsible for the preparation and implementation of the 
legislations to mitigate and control impacts on the Environment.
MoEFCC, through its Regional Offices and other subordinate organisations regulates 
Environmental compliances. Brief description of these organisations is given below:
1.4.2	
Central Pollution Control Board
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) basically design the schemes, procedures 
and standard to control the water, air, and noise pollution, land degradation and hazardous 
substances, and waste management. The executive responsibilities for the industrial pollution 
prevention and control are primarily executed by the CPCB at the Central level.
1.4.3	
State Pollution Control Boards
The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) were constituted to implement and monitor the 
environmental safeguards related to Air, Water, and Noise in respective States of the Indian 
Union. The SPCBs also provides advisory support to the Department of Environment in the 
States on Environmental Policy matters.
1.4.4	
Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA)
Coastal Zone Management Authorities have been set up both at National and State/
Union Territory levels. The objective of these authorities is to take measures for protecting 
and improving the quality of coastal environment and preventing, abating and controlling 
environmental pollution in coastal areas. Roads passing through coastal regulation zones 
need to take clearance from the Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) at the State 
level, and the MoFECC at Central level.
1.4.5	
National Board of Wildlife/State Wildlife Advisory Boards
The National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) is the apex advisory body in the field of Wildlife 
Conservation in the country and is headed by the Honorable Prime Minister of India. The 
NBWL takes decisions regarding the impact on wildlife due to road development activities. 
The Standing Committee of NBWL (SCNBWL), headed by Hon’ble Minister of Environment, 
Forests & Climate Change, appraises and issues recommendations related to proposed 
projects in and around wildlife areas. The SCNBL generally acts subsequent to, and on the

including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures. The 
language of the Directive principles of the state policy (Article 47) also contains a specific 
provision, which commits the state to protect the environment. In addition to Constitutional 
provisions, India has established a comprehensive set of laws for the management and 
protection of the environment. The Environmental Acts, Notifications, Rules and Amendments

CHAPTER 2
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING ENVIRONMENT CLEARANCE
2.1	
General Condition (GC)
The process of obtaining environmental clearance for road projects has been described in EIA 
Notification 2006, as amended from time to time. The applicability of Environment Clearance 
for highways projects is given under the SCHEDULE appended to the EIA Notification 2006. 
The relevant extract of the latest provision in relation to highway development projects is 
quoted below:
Project or Activity
Category with 
Threshold Limit
Category with

7(f)
Highways i) New 
National 
Highways; and
ii) Expansion 
of 
National 
Highways 
greater than 100 km, 
involving additional 
right of way or land 
acquisition 
greater 
than 40m on existing 
alignment and 60 m 
on re-alignments or 
bypasses.
i) All new State 
Highway Projects; 
and
ii) State 
Highway 
expansion 
projects 
in hilly terrain (above 
1000 
m 
AMSL) 
and/or 
ecologically 
sensitive areas.
General 
Condition* shall 
apply. 
Note: Highways 
include 
expressways
*General Condition:
Any highway project or activity specified in Category ‘B’ (please see the above table) will 
be treated as Category A, if located in whole or in part within 5 km from the boundary of: (i) 
Protected Areas notified under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, (ii) Critically Polluted areas 
as identified by the Central Pollution Control Board from time to time, (iii) Eco-sensitive areas 
as notified under section 3 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, such as, Mahabaleshwar 
Pachgani, Matheran, Pachmarhi, Dahanu, Doon Valley, and, (iv) inter-State boundaries and 
international boundaries.
Provided that the requirement regarding distance of 10 km of the State boundaries can be 
reduced or completely done away with by an agreement between the respective States or 
U.Ts sharing the common boundary in case the activity does not fall within 10 km of the areas 
mentioned at item (i), (ii), and (iii) above.
All Highway projects included as Category ‘A’ in the above quoted Schedule require prior 
environmental clearance from the Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2017
10
Forests (MoEFCC) on the recommendations of an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) 
constituted by the Central Government;
All Highway projects included as Category ‘B’ in the above Schedule which fulfill the General 
Conditions (GC) stipulated in the Schedule, require prior environmental clearance from the 
State/Union territory Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). The SEIAA bases 
its decision on the recommendations of a State or Union territory level Expert Appraisal 
Committee (SEAC). In the absence of a duly constituted SEIAA or SEAC, a Category ‘B’ 
project shall be treated as a Category ‘A’ project.
For the sake of clarity, Environment Clearance is not required in following cases:
1.	
Road development projects other than State Highways and National Highways
2.	
State Highway widening projects located below an altitude of 1000m AMSL
3.	
State Highway widening projects not located in an ecologically sensitive area
4.	
National Highway widening projects of upto 100 km length
5.	
National Highway widening projects of more than 100 km length involving 
additional right of way or land acquisition upto 40m (at any place) on existing 
alignment and 60 m (at any place) on re-alignments or bypasses.
“New National Highways”, though not defined anywhere, is understood to mean 
Greenfield projects
2.2	
Procedure for Environment Clearance
Since April 2014, MoEFCC has developed a single window web portal for all Environmental 
clearances. The portal is known as, ‘Online Submission & Monitoring of Environmental, 
Forest and Wildlife Clearances (OSMEFWC). The project authorities need to register on the 
Portal. After successful registration, the application for seeking Terms of Reference (TOR) for 
conducting the Environment Impact Assessment for the Project, or for seeking Environment 
Clearance (EC) may be uploaded online. The step-wise process for uploading the applications 
is provided on the Portal.
Along with the online submission, the Project Authorities are also required to submit hard 
copies of the applications and other documents. The Procedure for submission of application 
for obtaining prior Environment Clearance for Highway Projects is defined below:
The project proponent submits application [to MoEF&CC for category A projects and to the 
SEIAA for category B projects] in prescribed Form 1 (Annexure 1) including proposed Terms 
of Reference for carrying out EIA along with Feasibility Report before commencing any 
construction activity or preparation of land at site by the applicant.
The Process can best be divided into four stages:
	
•	
Screening [ Only For Category B Projects]



======================================================================

•	
Scoping
	
•	
Public Consultation
	
•	
Appraisal
2.2.1	
Screening (Stage I)
Screening refers to the ascertaining the requirement of undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) study for a B category project. The SEIAA screens the B category projects 
and decide as to whether EIA study is required or not for the project. If a project is considered 
not to require EIA study, it is categorized as category B2. Category B projects requiring EIA 
are categorized as category B1.
2.2.2	
Scoping (Stage II)
Scoping refers to the process of finalization of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the EIA 
study, so that the outcome of EIA and the resultant Environment Management Plan (EMP) is 
precise and relevant to the environmental settings of a particular project.
As per the latest amendments in EIA notification, 2016, scoping is required only for new 
highway projects located in States which are not border States. In all other cases (all new 
highway projects in border States and all highway widening projects), the EIA and EMP 
report is prepared on the basis of model TOR specified by MoEFCC.
The expert appraisal committee (under MoEFCC or SEIAA) on the basis of:
	
•	
Information furnished by the applicant in the prescribed format (Form 1 of 
EIA notification, 2006) including proposed terms of reference, and
	
•	
A site visit by a sub group of Expert Appraisal Committee, only if considered 
necessary by the Expert Appraisal Committee, 
determines the detailed comprehensive TOR addressing all relevant environmental concerns 
for the preparation of EIA and EMP.
Application for prior environment clearance may be rejected by the regulatory authority 
concerned on the recommendation of Expert Appraisal Committee concerned at this stage 
itself.
2.2.3	
Public Consultation (Stage III)
“Public Consultation” refers to the process by which the concerns of local affected persons 
and others who have plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the project or activity 
are ascertained with a view to taking into account all the material concerns in the project or 
activity design as appropriate. All Category ‘A’ and Category B1 projects or activities require 
holding of Public Consultations, except the following:
	
•	
Highway widening projects not involving acquisition of land, and
	
•	
Highway projects in border States
The Public Hearing is required to be arranged in a systematic, time bound and transparent 
manner ensuring widest possible public participation at the project site(s) or in its close

IRC:SP:93-2017
12
proximity District -wise, by the concerned State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) or the Union 
Territory Pollution Control Committee (UTPCC).
2.2.3.1	
The Process of Public Consultations:
The Applicant makes a request through a simple letter to the Member Secretary of the SPCB 
or UTPCC, in whose jurisdiction the project is located, to arrange the public hearing within 
the prescribed statutory period. In case the project site is extending beyond a State or Union 
Territory, the public hearing is mandated in each State or Union Territory in which the project 
is sited and the Applicant makes separate requests to each concerned SPCB or UTPCC for 
holding the public hearing.
The Applicant is required to enclose with the letter of request, at least 10 hard copies and an 
equivalent number of soft (electronic) copies of the draft EIA Report including the Summary 
Environment Impact Assessment report in English and in the local language, prepared strictly 
in accordance with the TOR communicated after Scoping (Stage-2), or the model TOR, as 
the case may be. Simultaneously, the applicant is required to forward copies, one hard and 
one soft, of the draft EIA Report along with the Summary EIA report to MoEFCC and to the 
following authorities or offices, within whose jurisdiction the project will be located:
	
(a)	
District Magistrate/s
	
(b)	
Zila Parishad or Municipal Corporation
	
(c)	
District Industries Office
	
(d)	
Concerned Regional Office of MoEFCC
On receiving the draft Environmental Impact Assessment report, the above-mentioned 
authorities, except the MoEFCC, arrange to widely publicize it within their respective 
jurisdictions requesting the interested persons to send their comments to the concerned 
regulatory authorities. They also make available the draft EIA Report for inspection 
electronically or otherwise to the public during normal office hours till the Public Hearing is 
over. The MoEFCC displays the Summary of the draft Environmental Impact Assessment 
report on its website, and also makes the full draft EIA available for reference at a notified 
place during normal office hours in the Ministry at Delhi.
The SPCB or UTPCC concerned also make similar arrangements for giving publicity about 
the project within the State/Union Territory and make available the Summary of the draft EIA 
for inspection in select offices or public libraries or panchayats, etc.
The Member-Secretary of the concerned SPCB or UTPCC finalizes the date, time and exact 
venue for the conduct of public hearing within 7(seven) days of the date of receipt of the draft 
EIA report from the project proponent, and advertises the same in one major National Daily 
and one Regional vernacular Daily. A minimum notice period of 30(thirty) days is provided to 
the public for furnishing their responses;
The District Magistrate or his or her representative not below the rank of an Additional District 
Magistrate assisted by a representative of SPCB or UTPCC, supervises and presides over 
the entire public hearing process.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2017
13
The attendance of all those who are present at the venue is noted and annexed with the final 
proceedings. A representative of the applicant initiates the proceedings with a presentation 
on the project and the Summary EIA report. Every person present at the venue is granted 
opportunity to seek information or clarifications on the project from the Applicant. The 
summary of the public hearing proceedings accurately reflecting all the views and concerns 
expressed is recorded by the representative of the SPCB or UTPCC and read over to the 
audience at the end of the proceedings explaining the contents in the vernacular language 
and the agreed minutes are signed by the District Magistrate or his or her representative on 
the same day and forwarded to the SPCB/UTPCC concerned.
A Statement of the issues raised by the public and the comments of the Applicant is prepared 
in the local language and in English and annexed to the proceedings.
The proceedings of the public hearing are conspicuously displayed at the office of the 
Panchyats within whose jurisdiction the project is located, office of the concerned Zila 
Parishad, District Magistrate, and the SPCB or UTPCC . The SPCB or UTPCC also display 
the proceedings on its website for general information. Comments, if any, on the proceedings 
may be sent directly to the concerned regulatory authorities and the Applicant concerned.
2.2.3.2	
Time period for completion of Public Hearing
The public hearing is required to be completed within a period of 45 (forty five) days from 
date of receipt of the request letter from the Applicant. Thereafter, the SPCB or UTPCC 
concerned is required to send the public hearing proceedings to the concerned regulatory 
authority within 8(eight) days of the completion of the public hearing . The applicant may also 
directly forward a copy of the approved public hearing proceedings to the regulatory authority 
concerned along with the final EIA report or supplementary report to the draft EIA report 
prepared after the public hearing and public consultations.
If the SPCB or UTPCC fails to hold the public hearing within the stipulated 45(forty five) days, 
the Central Government in Ministry of Environment and Forests for Category ‘A’ project or 
activity and the State Government or Union Territory Administration for Category ‘B’ project or 
activity at the request of the SEIAA, shall engage any other agency or authority to complete 
the process, as per procedure laid down in the EIA notification, 2006.
2.2.4	
Appraisal (Stage IV)
Appraisal refers to the detailed scrutiny, by the concerned Expert Appraisal Committee, of 
the application, Final EIA report, and public hearing proceedings, for grant of environmental 
clearance. This appraisal is made in a transparent manner in a proceeding to which the 
applicant is invited for furnishing necessary clarifications in person or through an authorized 
representative. On conclusion of this proceeding, the Expert Appraisal Committee makes 
categorical recommendations to the regulatory authority concerned either for grant of prior 
environmental clearance on stipulated terms and conditions, or rejection of the application, 
together with reasons for the same.



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2017
14
The appraisal of an application is completed by the Expert Appraisal Committee within sixty 
days of the receipt of the final EIA and other documents. Recommendations of the Expert 
Appraisal Committee are placed before the competent authority for a final decision within the 
next fifteen days.
2.2.5	
Grant or Rejection of Prior Environmental Clearance (EC)
The regulatory authority considers the recommendations of the EAC or SEAC concerned and 
conveys its decision to the applicant within forty five days of the receipt of the recommendations 
of the Expert Appraisal Committee or, in other words, within one hundred and five days of the 
receipt of the final EIA Report. 
In cases where the regulatory authority disagrees with the recommendations, it requests 
reconsideration by the Expert Appraisal Committee within forty five days of the receipt of 
the recommendations while stating the reasons for the disagreement. An intimation of this 
decision is simultaneously conveyed to the applicant. The Expert Appraisal Committee, in turn, 
considers the observations of the regulatory authority and furnishes its views on the same 
within a further period of sixty days. The decision of the regulatory authority, after considering 
the views of the Expert Appraisal Committee, is final and conveyed to the applicant by the 
regulatory authority concerned within next thirty days. 
In the event that the decision of the regulatory authority is not communicated to the applicant 
within the period mentioned above, the applicant may proceed as if the environment 
clearance sought for has been granted or denied by the regulatory authority in terms of the 
final recommendations of the Expert Appraisal Committee. 
Clearances from other regulatory bodies or authorities are not required prior to receipt 
of applications for prior environmental clearance of projects or activities, or screening, or 
scoping, or appraisal, or decision by the regulatory authority concerned, unless any of 
these is sequentially dependent on such clearance either due to a requirement of law, or for 
necessary technical reasons.
2.2.6	
Validity of Environmental Clearance (EC)
The “Validity of Environmental Clearance” is for five years in the case of highway projects. 
This period of validity may be extended by the regulatory authority concerned to a maximum 
period of seven years provided an application is made to the regulatory authority by the 
applicant.
2.2.7	
Post Environmental Clearance Monitoring
It is mandatory for the project management to submit half-yearly compliance reports in respect 
of the stipulated prior environmental clearance terms and conditions in hard and soft copies 
to the regulatory authority concerned, on 1st June and 1st December of each calendar year.

CHAPTER 3
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING CRZ CLEARANCE
3.1	
CRZ Clearance In Coastal Areas
As per Notification dated 6th January, 2011 under section 3(1), section 3(2)(v), and section 5(3)
(d) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 certain coastal stretches have been declared 
as coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and activities in the CRZ are thereby regulated.
In general, if a highway project passes within 500 m from high tide line or crosses back water/
creak, etc., prior CRZ clearance is required from Coastal Regulation Zone Authorities and 
MOEFCC. The boundary of 500 m is however, not sacrosanct, and the only way to ascertain 
the limits of CRZ is to refer to the CRZ map of the State.
For regulating development activities, the coastal stretches within 500 metres of High Tide 
Line on the landward side are classified into four categories, namely:
3.1.1	
Category I (CRZ-I)
A.	
The areas that are ecologically sensitive and the geo-morphological features 
which play a role in the maintaining the integrity of the coast,-
	
(a)	
Mangroves, in case mangrove area is more than 1000 sq mts, a buffer of 
50meters along the mangroves shall be provided;
	
(b)	
Corals and coral reefs and associated biodiversity;
	
(c)	
Sand Dunes;
	
(d)	
Mudflats which are biologically active;
	
(e)	
National parks, marine parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests, wildlife habitats 
and other protected areas under the provisions of Wild Life (Protection) 
Act, 1972 (53 of 1972), the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (69 of 1980) 
or Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986); including Biosphere 
Reserves;
	
(f)	
Salt Marshes;
	
(g)	
Turtle nesting grounds;
	
(h)	
Horse shoe crabs habitats;
	
(i)	
Sea grass beds;
	
(j)	
Nesting grounds of birds;
	
(k)	
Areas or structures of archaeological importance and heritage sites.
B.	
The area between Low Tide Line and High Tide Line;
3.1.2	
Category-II (CRZ-II)
The areas that have been developed upto or close to the shoreline.
Explanation.- For the purposes of the expression “developed area” is referred to as that area 
within the existing municipal limits or in other existing legally designated urban areas which 



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2017
19
are substantially built-up and has been provided with drainage and approach roads and other 
infrastructural facilities, such as water supply and sewerage mains;
3.1.3	
Category-III (CRZ-III)
Areas that are relatively undisturbed and those do not belong to either CRZ-I or II which 
include coastal zone in the rural areas (developed and undeveloped) and also areas within 
municipal limits or in other legally designated urban areas, which are not substantially built 
up.
3.1.4	
Category-IV (CRZ-IV)
	
A.	
The water area from the Low Tide Line to twelve nautical miles on the 
seaward side;
	
B.	
shall include the water area of the tidal influenced water body from the mouth 
of the water body at the sea upto the influence of tide which is measured as 
five parts per thousand during the driest season of the year.
3.1.5	
Special Category CRZ areas
Besides the above categories, certain areas requiring special consideration for the purpose 
of protecting the critical coastal environment and difficulties faced by local communities have 
been designated separately, as given below:
A.	
(i)	
CRZ area falling within municipal limits of Greater Mumbai;
	
(ii)	
the CRZ areas of Kerala including the backwaters and backwater islands;
	
(iii)	 CRZ areas of Goa.
B.	
Critically Vulnerable Coastal Areas (CVCA) such as Sunderbans region of West 
Bengal and other ecologically sensitive areas identified as under Environment 
(Protection) Act, 1986 and managed with the involvement of coastal communities 
including fisherfolk.
3.1.6	
Clearance procedure
The CRZ notification provides elaborate regulatory requirements for different types of CRZ 
areas. Generally, development activities are not allowed in sensitive CRZ zones. The project 
authorities are required to consult the Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) of the 
State for submitting the prescribed application. The alignment map of the highway project 
is superimposed on the CRZ map of the State to ascertain the location of the project in the 
CRZ.
The application for CRZ clearance is considered by CZMA, and the recommendation is 
submitted to MoEFCC. MoEFCC processes the proposal as per the procedure described 
above for Environment Clearance. In other words, if a road project does not otherwise require 
Environment Clearance as per the provisions of EIA notification, 2006, EC is still required in 
case the project alignment falls in CRZ area.

CHAPTER 4
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING FOREST CLEARANCE
4.1	
Forest Clearance
For any road project where a forest area is required to be taken under road construction, 
clearance for diversion of forest land (for non-forestry purpose) is necessary from the Ministry 
of Environment, Forests & Climate change (MoEFCC) under Forest Conservation Act, 1980. 
In J&K state, diversion of forest-land is done under Jammu & Kashmir Forest Conservation 
Act, 1997.
MoEFCC has ten Regional Offices (ROs). The ROs are authorized to clear linear projects, 
irrespective of the area or type of forest involved, with the recommendation of the Regional 
Empowered Committees (RECs). The headquarters and jurisdiction of the Regional Offices 
of MoEFCC are as given below:

Forest Clearance proposals are processed in two Stages. In the first Stage, in-principle 
approval is granted (or rejected) for diversion of the forest area, along with certain conditions. 
The conditions generally include:
	
I.	
Demand towards the Net Present Value of Forest land under diversion
	
II.	
Demand towards the amount for Compensatory Afforestation
	
III.	
Demand for an undertaking to plant a specified number of trees by 
project authorities
	
IV.	
Submission of a Plan for afforestation (For compensatory afforestation 
by the Forest Department, and for plantation along the project by the 
project authorities)
	
V.	
For such highway stretches where plantations have been raised on the 
ROW and subsequently notified as ‘Protected Forest’, while issuing 
the in-principle approval, in place of normal provision for compensatory 
afforestation, the regional offices generally stipulate a condition that for 
every tree cut, at least two trees should be planted.
	
VI.	
Demand for providing land for land for Compensatory Afforestation, to 
be transferred to the State Forest Department and notified as Protected 
Forest. This condition is not applicable in central Government projects. 
As a special provision for Central Government/Central Government 
undertaking projects, CA may be raised on degraded forest land spread 
over twice the forest area being diverted.
The Final (Second Stage) Clearance is issued by MoEFCC after fulfillment of the conditions 
and receiving an undertaking regarding compliance of the conditions which are due to be 
fulfilled in due course.
After the receipt of Compliance Report, fulfilling the conditions stipulated in Stage-I (in-principle 
approval) from the user agencies through the respective State/UT Governments, Stage-II 
clearance is accorded by concerned RO of MoEFCC. Following this, the project authorities 
are handed over the forest land for non-forestry use, by the State Government, provided they

have other requisite clearances also. However, for linear projects, tree cutting permission 
and working permission is granted by the concerned DFO after the Stage-I clearance, after 
confirmation from the Central Government that the user agency has deposited the requisite 
amount for Compensatory Afforestation, NPV, etc.

CHAPTER 5
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING WILDLIFE CLEARANCE
5.1	
Wildlife Clearance
Wildlife clearance is a pre-requisite for diversion of forest land located in PAs. When a road 
project passes through a protected area (PA), viz., a National Park, Wildlife Sanctuary or 
bioshpere reserve, etc. Prior wildlife clearance is necessary from National Board of Wildlife, 
even if the project does not involve diversion of forest land from the PA. In case Forest land 
diversion is also involved, the proposal of Forest Clearance for such areas is also processed 
simultaneously, both online, and in hard copies. However, Forest Clearance in such cases is 
received only after securing Wildlife Clearance.
It is important to mention that even surveys and geotechnical studies in PAs require prior 
clearance from the National Board of Wildlife. The form for wildlife clearance consists 5 parts 
(Attached as Annexure III).
5.2	
Procedure for Forest Clearance in PAs
In case of PAs, the online proposal of Forest Clearance is submitted first. The proposal for 
wildlife Clearance can then be submitted. The step-wise procedure for uploading of proposals 
is given on the web Portal.

CHAPTER 6
OTHER RELEVANT CLEARANCES
6.1	
Clearance for Eco-Sensitive Zones
All the PAs have Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZ) earmarked all along the periphery of a particular 
PA. The limits of an ESZ are notified, and vary across the PAs, and along different directions 
outside a PA. However, unless such boundaries are notified, a 10 km radius from the boundary 
of a PA is taken as the ESZ. Clearance for such areas is required, only in case the project 
requires Environment Clearance. In such an eventuality, clearance for the ESZ of a PA is 
granted by the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife, as per the procedures 
for Wildlife Clearance
For the areas covered under the Project Tiger, even outside the core area of a PA, and 
the migratory corridors of Tigers contagious to such areas, clearance is required from the 
Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife on recommendation of the National 
Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) as per the procedure for Wildlife Clearance, under 
Section 38(O)(G) of Wildlife Protection Act.
For all other ESZs, notified under the Environment Protection Act, clearance is considered as 
a part of Environment Clearance, only if the requirement of EC is triggered
6.2	
Permission from State/Central Ground Water Authority
For the construction of highway, if water requirements are met through ground water, prior 
permission is required from State/Central Ground Water Board.
6.3	
Permission of Irrigation Department/Water Resource Department
For the construction of highway, if water requirements are met through River/Canal,etc., prior 
permission is required from Irrigation Department//Water Resource Department.
6.4	
NOC from Archaeological Department
When Highways passes within the 400 m of a protected Historical or Archaeological 
Monument, NOC is required from Archeological Department under Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeological Site and Remains Acts 1958, which is key legislation for preservation of 
culture and historical remains.
6.5	
Permission for Quarrying and Borrowing Operations
At the time of construction of highway, permission of Department of Geology and Mines, State 
Government is required for new quarry and borrowing operations. Environmental Clearance 
is required for extraction of minor minerals as follows:
	
a)	
For mining area upto 5 ha- From District Level Environmental Impact 
Assessment Authority (DEIAA)
	
b)	
For mining area of more than 5 ha and less than 50 ha – From State 
Environmental Impact Assessment Authority(SEIAA)
	
c)	
For mining area of 50 ha or more – From MoEFCC
