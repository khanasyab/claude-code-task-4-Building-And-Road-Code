Recommended  Practice  for  the  Design  
and  Layout  of  Cycle  Tracks
1  Introduction
Cycles and cycle rickshaws (passenger and goods) are the preferred mode of travel to meet 
access needs in addition to walk. Bicycle is the most affordable form of transport available to 
low income households. Combined with walk, they are called Non Motorised Transport (NMT) 
users which also include four wheeled trolley used by street vendors and hawkers, three 
wheeled tricycle used by mobility for people with disabilities, etc. These users are dependent 
on walk and bicycle even for commuting longer distances. Even in megacities (population > 
8 million) modal share of NMT ranges between 40% – 50%. Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) 
can offer increased mobility to large Section of the population, safeguard the accessibility of 
otherwise congested cities and provide freedom of movement to rich and poor, young and 
old. NMT not only offers environmental advantages but provides a holistic range of benefits 
to both the individual and the city. This includes health, equity, better air quality, poverty 
alleviation, road safety, liveable cities and equal opportunities to all irrespective of socio-
economic background. Indian cities have a high latent demand for bicycles and walking trips, 
which can be realized with introduction of suitable infrastructure, facilities and resources.
There has been a declining use of NMT as a result of higher income levels and hostile 
conditions for NMT on roads resulting in greater dependency on privately owned motorised 
transport. City authorities have failed to provide safer streets to non-motorised transport 
(NMT) users. The absence of safe infrastructure and high cycle fatalities also deter potential 
NMT users to shift bicycle or walking in large Indian cities.
The Road Safety and Design Committee (H-7) deliberated on the draft in a series of meetings. 
The H-7 Committee finally approved the drat document in its meeting held on 25th March, 
2014 and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the HSS Committee.

in its meeting held on 9th August, 2014. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 
18th August, 2014 approved the same document for placing it before the Council. The IRC 
Council in its 203rd meeting held at New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2014 approved the draft 
IRC:11-2015 “Recommended Practice for the Design and Layout of Cycle Tracks” 
(First Revision) for publishing.
2  SCOPE
 The present guidelines provide a comprehensive overview to make cycle friendly 
infrastructure in cities. Guidance is given for rural roads also.
3  BICYCLING  IN  INDIAN  CONTEXT
Bicycle is for all. It is used by all age groups and gender. NMT users can also be classified 
into two categories – one who bicycles by choice and the second who is a ‘captive cyclist’ who 
is bound by economic constraints and does not have a choice. Indian Cities are dominated 
by the latter. The presence of an infrastructure will encourage choice and recreational use. 
High ownership of bicycles, low cost and easy use make it a desirable mode of transport 
for students and low income workers. The absolute number of cyclists rise to a million that 
account to about 6-8 percent of modal share in mega cities. Regardless of city size many 
Indian cities have 80 percent of the trips shorter than 3 km and about 70 percent less than 
10 km (Jain, 2013). These trips are ideal for non-motorized modes like bicycles.
From the point of sustainability and preservation of the environment, India has to take steps to 
make travel by cycles more attractive. The benefits of cycling are well known. The promotion 
of active transport (cycling and walking) for everyday physical activity is a win-win approach; 
it not only promotes health but can also lead to positive environmental effects, especially if 
cycling and walking replace short car trips. (HEAT- Health Economic Assessment Tool for 
walking and cycling ((WHO), 2011)) Cycling and walking can also be more readily integrated 
into people’s busy schedules than, for example, leisure-time exercise. Also, In Indian cities, 
50 - 80% of the road related injuries are to the pedestrians and cyclists though the status had 
been similar since late 1980s. Bicycles generate no noise pollution and emissions. A better

bicycle infrastructure can play an important role in increasing the modal share of bicycles, 
reducing air pollution and reducing the adverse health effects of pollution.
4 THREE FOLD APPROACH
4.1 	
Planning
A NMT master Plan and a network plan highlight the issues of cohesion and directness, 
attractiveness and comfort and safety and security, the three founding principles in planning 
a bicycle infrastructure. These objectives can be met only when cyclists have a network of 
usable links which can take them from end to end. The NMT Master Plan should set the goals 
and desired level of service for bicycle friendly infrastructure and include quantifiable criteria 
such as average cycling speeds, capacity (at a desired level of service - LOS), parking 
infrastructure (frequency and capacity along the route), integration options with public 
transport (parking infrastructure, fare concessions, feeder infrastructure,) etc.
4.2	
Design
Infrastructure design should be based upon the road hierarchy in the network and the 
identification of the corridor. As part of data collection it is important to collect accurate total 
station surveys, activity surveys and traffic volume and parking count. Accident data will help 
the designer to understand the black spots and dangerous areas in the corridor identified. 
It involves preparation of geometric alignment based upon road typology and intersection 
needs. The five basic principles for design are coherence, directness, safety and security, 
attractiveness and comfort. They are important to make any infrastructure bicycle friendly. 
Further detailing of the infrastructure is also required. This includes the choice of surface 
material, signage, marking, street furniture as well as location of bicycle parking and other 
support facilities like hawker spaces, etc.
4.3	
Implementation and Evaluation
 The implementation phase includes detailed cost estimates based on the implementation 
drawings. Also, at the time of construction, safety of the workers as well as people passing 
through the zone needs to be given utmost importance. IRC: SP: 55:2013 Guidelines on traffic 
management at work zones highlights the importance of traffic management and includes 
instructions and checklist required by project manager at site during construction. Another 
important aspect post construction is evaluation of a cycle facility, Auditing and Benchmarking 
are important to assess the performance of an individual bicycle facility at network as well as 
at city level.
5  BASIC  INFORMATION
5.1	
Vehicle Dimension
Table 1 gives various dimensions.
Cycle:	
Bicycles are commonly used to carry gas cylinders, milk cans, etc. It is also 
commonly used for vending, and used for services such as post-delivery, telephone repair,

garbage collection, etc. The bicycle is also used as retail platform to display and sell products, 
like toys, cooked food, tobacco products, etc. (Fig. 1).
Cycle Rickshaw:	
Cycle rickshaw is predominantly used as the main vehicle for commuting 
(mainly in small and medium sized cities) since the trips are short. (Fig. 2).
Good Rickshaw:	
Rickshaw is also used to transport goods to and from commercial shops. 
It is clear that even though in cities there are no visible passenger cycle rickshaw, good 
rickshaw are predominantly used for freight transport. The rickshaw needs to be the limiting 
design vehicle for the NMT infrastructure. (Fig. 2).
Tricycle for the differently abled: These are used by many physically challenged and 
mobility impaired for commuting from one place to the other.

5.2	
Design Speed
The average speed range of NMT is about 5 km/hr – 15 km/hr. In rare cases, it can be 
seen to be 20 km/hr. It is important for cyclists gain a cruising speed for constant usage. 
Interruptions due to parking, side roads, access to properties affect the desirable speed and 
make it difficult for the cyclist. Hence, variations in alignment, levels and form of the bicycle 
infrastructure should be avoided. Vertical Gradients need to be well accommodated.
5.3	
Clearances and Width
The width requirement for a NMV in movement is higher than its physical dimensions. This is 
on account of two main factors, i.e. zigzagging movement (side to side movement to maintain 
balance during riding) and fear of obstacles (or maintenance of manoeuvring gap). Bicyclists 
carrying goods and pillion riders may experience higher zigzagging on account of extra weight 
carried, while cycle rickshaws experience minimal or no zigzagging. The distance that NMV 
maintain for fear of obstacles depends on the height of the obstacle. Figure 3 shows us the 
variations in width and clearances from different obstacles.

Turning Radius
Bends are required for smooth connections between cycling path, and also to ensure continuity 
of the infrastructure. The radius of curves used in bending a path affects the speed of NMVs 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:11-2015

using it. Sharper the bend, lower the speed. Minimum design speed for stability requirement 
of a bicyclist is 12 km/hr. Bends of 30 m radius or more are preferred on segregated bicycle 
tracks to maintain visual directness and continuity of the path and also to reduce the path 
widening requirement due to additional width requirement for a rider negotiating bends. It is 
also evident that turning radius of less than 10 m should not be considered as it does not 
permit cycling at comfortable cruising speeds.
5.5	
Riding on Bends
A safe leaning angle for a cyclist while negotiating a bend at a co-efficient of friction of 0.3, 
is about 18º from the vertical or 72º from the horizontal plane. A widening of about 0.51 m 
per lane is required to accommodate the extra width on account of this bending. At cruising 
speed, widening of cycle lanes become necessary for all turning radiuses less than 120 m 
(when the lean angle is negligible and widening requirement falls to less than 0.05 m per 
lane).
5.6 	
Inclines and Slopes
While designing infrastructure for the cyclists, horizontal/ vertical/super elevation are of minor 
consideration. Only vertical gradients are applicable. The most desirable condition is to avoid 
level changes or introduction of any inclines along NMV infrastructure. In some conditions, 
negotiating a bridge or a tunnel may be unavoidable for a cyclist. These can be a nuisance 
especially rickshaws and bicyclists carrying goods or passengers. It is very important to 
make the ground level more bicycle friendly than expecting the cyclists to detour from their 
natural path. Table 2 indicates the recommended slope gradient.

Negotiated

1:40 - 1:60
On a decline, junctions and obstructions should be spaced reasonably far from the bottom of 
the incline because cyclists (especially those carrying load) need plenty of free space at the 
bottom of the incline to recover from the speed.
6  PROVISION  OF  CYCLE  INFRASTRUCTURE
An efficient urban road network follows a road hierarchy. The road hierarchy is based on the 
function that the road is expected to perform, and the type of traffic and the road users present 
on the road. The design speeds, road widths and other geometric features are adapted to 
suit the road function. The various types of road classification and their speeds has been 
discussed in IRC:86 - Geometric Design for roads in urban areas (IRC:86-1983).

Typical Cross-Sections of Streets with Dedicated Cycle Tracks
Figs. 4 & 5 give typical cross-sections of arterial/sub arterial streets with dedicated cycle 
tracks. The cycle tracks indicated therein are predominantly one-way though this cannot be 
strictly adhered to. Two way movement is possible. A verge separating the motor traffic and 
the cycle track prevents the motor vehicles from straying into cycle track. However, it is seen 
that motorcycles do enter the facility and this needs to be prevented with enforcement. The 
width of the verge shall be a minimum of 1 m, but can be reduced to 0.75 m in exceptional 
circumstances where the available width is restricted.

Typical Cross-Section of Dedicated Cycle Path in Non-Urban Areas
Dedicated cycle paths away from a highway, though not common in India at present, should 
have a minimum width of 3 m capable of accommodating bidirectional traffic. Suitable berms 
(shoulders) shall be provided on either side of a width of 1 m. Where unintended use by 
pedestrians can be expected, the cycle track should be at least 3.5 m wide.
Where these paths run adjacent to a highway, a safety barrier (W-Beam Steel type) shall be 
provided to prevent injury to the cyclist in case of motor vehicle going off the carriageway.

Capacity of Cycle Tracks
The capacity of a bicycle lane depends on the number of effective lanes used by bicycles. 
A standard width of an effective bicycle lane mentioned in HCM is approximately 1.2 m. The 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommends off street 
bicycle paths of 3 m wide. In HCM 2010, for exclusive bicycle facilities operating under 
uninterrupted flow conditions the capacity seen is 1600 bicycles/h/ln for two way bicycle 
facilities and 3200 bicycles/h/ln for one way facilities. The Highway Capacity Manual 2010 
recommends that a saturation flow rate of 2000 bicycles/h/ln for a one direction bicycle 
lane.
Based on field observation in segregated cycle facility in New Delhi, it has been seen that 
a 2.5 m segregated cycle track can carry 3000 cyclists per hour (in predominantly one way 
cycle tracks on each side of the carriageway) at a reasonably good level of service and 
comfortable speeds.
One can therefore estimate the capacity to be higher for larger width of segregated cycle 
tracks.
6.5	
Intersection
It is important to design an intersection keeping in view the needs of a bicyclist. Crossing 
choices for cyclists could be along with or as vehicular traffic, or along with or as pedestrian 
traffic or independent of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

This solution is often chosen by 
lack of other feasible options.
Intersection design can contribute to 
clearer position of cyclists;
Conflict points can be identified and 
thus conflicts can be managed;
Usually these intersections will be more 
complicated and more spacious.
Integrating bicycle specific infrastructure with an intention of addressing the requirements of 
all NMV users at a junction, presents challenges of decreased efficiency and higher delays 
for motorized modes. The most appropriate solution based on the type of junction as well as 
site conditions/constraints should be used. The four main types of junction solutions are:
 
● 
Roundabouts: Safety of cyclists and pedestrians negotiating a roundabout 
can be ensured by reduced vehicular speeds and geometric designs, ensuring 
adequate segregation and visibility for the slow moving users. Modern 
roundabouts allow better capacity without compromising safety. However it 
is important to understand that roundabouts have capacity limitations.
 
● 
Signalized Junctions: At signalised intersections, expected delays for 
cyclists are considerably longer than other junction solutions. Therefore, 



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 45
======================================================================
IRC:11-2015
10
a flexible approach to adapt a single or combination of crossing methods 
should be adopted. In signalized intersection, the following is of importance 
–
	
- 	
Segregation at or Near Intersection ensures safety and directness 
for cyclists. Cycle tracks extending up to the stop line on near side of 
the junction ensure reduced delays, higher safety and protection from 
traffic path for bicyclists across signalized intersection, bicycle facilities 
(tracks or lanes) on both sides of the junction is a designated as well as 
direct path for NMV users.
Fig. 9  Cycle Track at Intersection
	
-	
Bicycle Boxes or Stacking Spaces are required for waiting cyclists on 
the near side of junctions. Bicycle holding area or boxes and signal 
phase design are inter-related to the flow of bicyclists and motorized 
vehicles, and need to be looked at together.
	
-	
Free segregated left turning vehicular lanes deny cyclists and pedestrians 
any safe time to cross the junction, and adds to their delays and risk to 
accidents. A demarcated path referred to as intersection crossing Cycle 
box on the carriageway may be provided either ahead of or behind the 
zebra/pedestrian crossing. However, it is clear at all those junctions, 
especially those on arterial roads, NMVs flexibility in crossing along 
with vehicles is required to reduce delays. This cannot be facilitated 
without providing stacking boxes ahead of vehicular queues. NMVs 
accessing bicycle boxes or stacking space should be provided with 
a clear, defined and barrier free path. At locations, where the bicycle 
track does not open directly onto the cycle box, a surface colored 
and pavement marked bicycle lane (with bicycle symbols) should be 
provided as a direct connection between the two.
	
-	
It is important to check the proposed signal plan for bicycle compatibility. 
Currently, signal engineers tend to exclude NMV requirements from

design considerations leading to inefficient and unsafe designs for 
cyclists. A separate signal phase might not be required.
	
●	
Traffic Calmed and Un-signalized Junctions: For minor intersections, it 
is recommended to apply traffic calming such as mini roundabouts, speed 
humps, table tops to keep the speed of motor vehicles at check.
	
●	
Grade Separated Crossing: Grade separated infrastructure should address 
all requirements of both current and potential cyclists. In some situations, 
this approach may require provision of both, at grade and grade separated 
crossing facilities to address different requirement for various NMV users. 
Grade separation of intersecting motorized vehicle carriageway is a high 
cost intersection design solution, which may be suitable for use on highways 
or expressways. Such solutions are not desirable within the built up areas or 
urban limit due to their adverse impact on accidents, pollution, etc. However, 
additional grade separation of NMV and pedestrian traffic across high-speed 
high volume motorized vehicle carriageway may often be advisable to ensure 
safety of cyclists and pedestrians.

crossing method for cyclists. Section 8.5 shows some design configurations as mentioned 
above.
6.6	
Special Conditions
While cross section and intersection designs provide location specific solutions, they cannot 
be completely used for implementation and development of a bicycle infrastructure on a 
corridor. This section discusses the alignment, layout and integration of various conditions 
and situations which are seen on roads, in a plan and profile drawing for implementation. 
To comply with the principles of bicycle infrastructure, the following should to be taken into 
consideration:
	
●	
Location of NMV/Bicycle Path/Lane in the Cross Section
	
●	
Width of bicycle path/lane
	
●	
Form of bicycle path/lane: Bicycle lanes require less width than segregated 
bicycle tracks. Bicycle lanes may be introduced for the length of a stretch 
constrained by available space where there is an existing track.
	
●	
Function of bicycle path/lane: Compromises affecting the function of 
bicycle path/lane include combining or sharing of bicycle infrastructure with 
other users or functions such as pedestrian path in case of NMV/Bicycle 
tracks and carriageway in case of NMV/Bicycle lanes. These compromises 
should only be made where continuous length of constriction/limitation is 
between 5 and 40 m.
The special conditions seen are as follows:
1.	
Bus Shelters – When curb side shelters are installed on the road, it needs to be 
connected to the pedestrian path. Ideally, for a segregated cycle facility, one has 
to detour the cyclists from their natural path but for a short distance.

2.	
Hawker Spaces – Presence of hawkers and street vendors provides security and 
services to road commuters. Allocation of a dedicated space shall also make the 
street more lively and interesting.
Fig. 11  Special Condition - Hawker Space
3.	
Obstacles – Trees, encroachments etc. might create hindrance in the natural 
path of the cyclist. It is important to eliminate such obstacles such as light poles, 
encroachments, etc. At places, where trees also lie in the path of the cyclist, for 
a short stretch, it is important to change the course of the cyclist with the proper 
turning radius and bring him back to the natural path. Similarly, condition of bicycle 
infrastructure changes depending upon the length of such  limitations. In certain 
conditions, the cyclists share with pedestrians a common path. This ranges 
between 3 m to 4 m and should not be more  than a length of 40 m.

7  DESIGN  DETAILS
Use of pavement material, provision of signage and marking, integration of street furniture 
and other support facilities has been discussed in detail in the following sections.
7.1	
Pavement Surface
Asphalt, Concrete, interlocking tiles, pavers, granite, stones, etc. have been used as surface 
material for cycle facility. Road authorities usually select between materials for closed surfacing 
and open surfacing on the basis of cost, maintenance and repair work for different agencies. 
But cyclists have a clear preference for closed surfacing, such as asphalt & evenness and the 
least resistance and most comfortable. The components of bicycle infrastructure mentioned 
will actually consist of the inner subsurface material and surfacing material. There are bound 
to be some irregularities in closed surfacing materials like cracks, fissures and projections. 
Table 7 indicates the acceptable surface irregularities on bikeways.
Table 7  Orientation of Irregularities
Orientation of Irregularities
Cracks
Projections
Parallel
13 mm wide
10 mm high
Perpendicular

20 mm high
Notes:	1.	
Cracks/Fissures in the surface. Often found in hot mix asphalt surfaces or between 
	
slabs of Portland cement concrete.
	
2.	
Projections: abrupt rises in the surface of the travelled way. May be caused by sinking 
	
drainage grates, crude patching of the surface, and partial erosion of a layer of asphalt, 
	
pavement joints, pedestrian ramp transitions, or root growth under pavement.
The Criteria for selection is as follows in order of priority:
	
- 	
Riding Quality/Evenness of Surface: An attractive riding comfort for cyclists 
can only be achieved with a well paved, smooth, and free of irregularities 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:11-2015
16
like cracks and fissures which can be easily achieved by use of asphalt and 
concrete. Holes and bumps can cause bicyclists to swerve into the path of 
motor vehicles. Apart from an uncomfortable riding experience, it can lead to 
resistance in cycling experience and their energy consumption.
	
-	
Skid Resistance (CROW, Record 25 : Design manual for bicycle traffic, 
June 2007) : Skid resistance of paving is generally determined by its texture. 
Texture includes macro-texture (it offers space for the storage of rainwater 
and dirt so that proper tyre is maintained between the bicycle tyre and the 
road surface) and micro-texture (roughness of the individual stone particles 
in paving material). It governs the safety of the cyclists along with the riding 
comfort.
	
-	
Ease of Maintenance & Repair: By design, no cables and pipes for services 
should be placed under the cycle tracks else it would definitely affect the riding 
comfort of the bicyclists since they require constant maintenance and detour 
cyclists from natural path. Road authorities must allow laying of asphalt/
concrete over pipes and cables only if cost estimation required for movement 
or reworking is allotted. The repair work should give the same results as 
the original and leave no patches or bumps on the road which gives riding 
discomfort. At areas where there is snow fall, snow and ice clearing has to 
be taken into consideration. Durability and management is an essential for 
selection of road materials. High maintenance materials such as granite and 
expensive stone finish are not preferred.
	
-	
Drainage: Improper drainage results in unsafe and uncomfortable riding 
experience. It also makes the facility unattractive.
	
-	
Capital Cost: The cost of kerbing plays an important role in ascertaining the 
cost. For example Well laid tile paving including kerbing is more expensive 
than asphalt and concrete paving. As a prerequisite, the foundations should 
be wider than the paving to help control edge damage. It also leads to safety 
at mishaps.
	
-	
Cost of Maintenance & Repair: Materials which have high durability will not 
Demolition & residual value.
	
-	
Pavement Strength: Design and engineering judgment is required while 
selecting the material keeping in mind heavy traffic and therefore asphalt or 
concrete are preferred where comfort for cycling can be ensured.
	
-	
Functional Appropriateness: Use of a material should satisfy the 
visual comfort or highlight the requirement of function. It would affect the 
attractiveness, safety and comfort as requirements of a cycle infrastructure.
Based on the above criteria, the desirability of various materials as pavement surface has 
been discussed in Table 8.

7.2	
Edge Treatments
The path of a cyclist is identified by the edges on both the sides of the infrastructure. Depending 
upon the form and type of NMV infrastructure provided, the solution of the edges differs with 
the use of a kerb, green hedges, bollards, etc. Green areas provide shade, qualitative spaces 
and an ambient environment for not only cyclists but all road users. It should be kept in mind 
that the height and the level of the edge condition should be treated as a vertical obstruction 
and adequate shy away should be provided so as not to compromise the requisites of NMT 
infrastructure.
For Arterial Roads, the provision of cycle infrastructure is segregated and has to respond to 
two different edge conditions. One side is towards the carriageway and the other towards 
the footpath. The edge condition towards carriageway is a kerb or a verge of bare minimum 
0.75 m though 1.5 m is desirable. The level of the cycle track and the verge could be same 
or with a maximum level difference of 25 mm. This could function as a utility zone for water 
to slope into the verge and locating sign poles and other vertical utilities provided within 
adequate shy away. Also, not having any level difference between the two areas has its 
advantages. The space could be seen as an extension of cycle track and during peak hours 
or high volumes, such areas can be used by overtaking cyclists. It is not advisable to have 
a kerbstone edge without a verge because it is easier for two wheelers to misuse the NMV 
facility for overtaking and using it as another lane for seamless movement. This should be 
managed by enforcement. The edge condition towards the pedestrian path can be physically 
segregated with a kerb with a level difference of 75 mm maximum or by introducing a green 
belt/utility area where the ROW permits. This width of the green belt could determine the 
kind of plantation i.e. from hedges to a regular/irregular tree line based on the landscaping 
plan. All vertical installations like light poles and sign poles can be located in this section thus 
making the cross section safer for all modes and making the cyclists more visible to the fast 
moving traffic. This should be done with careful discretion not compromising the choice route 
of the cyclist.
For Distributor roads, deterrent strips are cycle segregators. If the cycle lane is placed just 
next to the parking bay, the cyclists must be able to keep the safe distance from parked cars 
without deviating from the lane. For Indian roads (with speed limit of 30 km/hr), there are 
two methods in which the deterrent strip can be implemented. It could either be a 500 mm 
painted strip or a 500 mm slight depression on the surface to provide a tactile warning to the

parked vehicle. In case of distributor roads, since the cycle lane is painted, if there could be 
a segregator between the footpath and the painted lane, the collection chamber could be 
put there which would prevent installation of grating in the lane and would prevent injuries/ 
accidents of cyclists.
7.3	
Road Furniture & Support Facilities
Street furniture and support facilities are important elements that enhance the comfort, 
visual quality, convenience and security for cyclists and pedestrians. Street furniture includes 
benches, bollards, etc. They provide comfort for pedestrians and a rest area for cyclists. They 
can help in identifying an area of different function. Few points should be kept while this is 
used:
	
-	
Vandalism Proof. The most important feature of any street furniture is that it 
should be vandalism proof. The fact that such are fixed in the public realm and 
it is very difficult for road authorities to keep a round the clock maintenance 
makes this quality of utmost importance.
	
-	
Easy to install. Otherwise road managers would require special equipment to 
install them making it less favourable to use.
	
-	
Requires less or no maintenance.
	
-	
Attractive design.
	
-	
Economical design.
	
-	
Ease in production.
Support facilities such as hawkers and street vendors are a small yet significant component 
of road users. Their presence on the street not only helps increase safety, but their services 
provide convenience to cyclists. Their presence is already admissive on the street roads; 
however they are not integrated in the road design. Their integration affects the comfort 
and the safety of cyclists. Incase no provision is facilitated and no integration by design is 
undertaken, there is bound to be an encroachment on to the infrastructure provided for other 
users especially cyclists, which would push the users into unsafe conditions.
A detailed discussion for the determinant factors of the above has been discussed in 
IRC:103-1988: Guidelines for pedestrian facilities (1988).
7.4	
Illumination
Street lighting is an important component that makes the available space legible for each 
road user. The illumination of a street is governed by the design speed. For cyclists, lighting 
also adds to the comfort while riding. In fact, lighting is the basic street furniture requirement 
that will help in functioning of the entire bicycle infrastructure network. Lighting specifications 
(based on design for Delhi BRT Corridor) for a cycle facility are as follows:
 
●  
At no point along the lanes average horizontal illuminance should be less 
than minimum 40 lux.
 
●  
At no point along the lanes Vertical illuminance should be less than Minimum: 
20.0 lux (Measured at 1.5 m above roadway in both directions parallel to the 
roadway).

●

●

Location of poles is also decided based upon the category of the road. It could be the 
central verge or at sides where a segregated cycle facility is available. Two luminaries can be 
mounted on a pole located between the carriageway and the cycle track at different height 
to light the required area with the required lux levels. This would also reduce the number of 
poles required and the vertical clutter on any given road.
Color of light: Street lighting should produce enough intensity required for face recognition 
and objects from a particular sight distance. Especially for the purpose of social safety, women 
and children are a special group for whom the color of light is of added importance. White 
light is a preferred choice.
7.5	
Traffic Calming
The variation in speeds between vehicles is the major cause of accidents. Establishing a 
speed zone is a design-enforced methodology where the three basic elements, infrastructure, 
roads users and the vehicle, of the traffic system should be adapted to each other. Here 
infrastructure design can be instrumental in ensuring safety by affecting the user and vehicle 
behaviour. Influencing the user behaviour by using visual warnings/pre-warnings such as 
signage and markings or physical and psychological warnings like humps, speed tables and 
table tops help inform the user in a visual or palpable way about a change in the situation. 
Similarly, influencing the vehicle behaviour by a specific change in geometric alignment 
reduces speed. They need to be logistically positioned and be visible from a distance for 
the user to react. Signs and marking should be effectively placed and are used as advance 
warning/pre-warning to road users.
Traffic calming includes narrowing, chicanes, speed humps, rumble strips and table tops. It 
is important to understand that traffic calming is taken up to bring down the vehicular speed 
similar to that of NMT. In an Indian scenario, chicanes and narrowing have not been as 
successful as in the west due to high number of two wheelers. Also, to curb speeds of two 
wheelers the speed humps should be created on the entire length of the carriageway, else 
two wheelers detour path and pass at grade creating hazard for cyclists. Speed Humps are 
one of the most effective traffic calming devices and can be used on virtually any kind of road, 
with posted speed limits of up to 50 km/hr. Speed Humps most successful for Indian streets 
are trapezoidal and table tops.
-	
Trapezoidal humps have a flat top, which is generally 2.5 m wide. If the flat top is 
8 m or more in width, it is known as the platform or table top (MOSTH, 2000) (also 
used as a barrier friendly infrastructure). The maximum gap required between

speed humps to maintain a speed zone of 30 km/hr., is 50 to 100 m and for a 
speed zone of 50 km/hr. it is 150 to 200 m for 50 km/hr. (depending on the design 
of speed hump and the speed of vehicle on it).
Fig. 17  Trapezoidal Hump
-	
Rumble strips and bars generate a lot of noise and hence should not be 
used in residential streets. They may thus be appropriate for use at special mid 
block and junction approaches on arterial and other non residential distributor 
roads. In addition it may be advisable to use rumble strips as pre-warners to speed 
humps (50-100 m before) on arterial roads where approach speeds are higher 
and pre-warning is desirable.
7.6	
Signage & Marking
The signage system comprises of regulatory, informatory and warning messages, as per 
IRC. The size of the signage also depends upon the design speed. Therefore the maximum 
is used for arterial roads and the minimum is used for access and distributor. However, in 
specific cases where the role of the signage is more important, the bigger size can be used. 
In updated version IRC:67, Code of practice for road signs, (Indian Roads Congress (IRC), 
2012) many signs have been modified as well as new have been added to address the 
cyclists and other road users. (Refer section 8.6 ).
Like signages, markings also play a complementary role to inform the cyclists as well as other 
road users about the nature of the bicycle infrastructure in the zone they are present. They act

as guides and pre-warnings or advance warnings signs to caution the user of the subsequent 
situation. A comprehensive description of various kinds of markings used has been explained 
in IRC:35, Code of practice for road markings, Fig. 17 shows area of application of a cycle 
box at the junction. Other markings for cyclists have been indicated in the Section 8.7.

Services & Utilities
Drainage - Drainage should be addressed while design of cycle lanes and tracks to prevent 
ponding, erosions during rains. Improper design of gully gratings, water collection on the 
edge of bicycle lanes/tracks will hinder the comfort of riding and will prevent cyclists from its 
usage. In arterial roads, by design there would be a segregated bicycling facility or a cycle 
track. No services that require regular maintenance should be laid below the cycle track. In 
case a segregated facility is provided the drainage should be flush to the floor of the cycle 
track and the drain is put along one edge so that in times of an open manhole or annual 
maintenance work being carried out, one side is available for movement. For distributor and 
access streets placing a collection grating along the edge of the footpath can be placed. A 
bell mouth arrangement to collect water is not recommended. The grating should be flushed 
to the floor of the carriageway and the cover should not hamper the movement of cyclists. 
The cover of the grating should be perpendicular to the direction of the travel of bicyclists so 
that the tyre does not get stuck and make the cyclist fall.
Other Under and Over Ground Utilities: Apart from the lighting and drainage there are 
other utilities that affect the comfort of cyclists.
Table 10 shows the various other utilities, overhead and underground, that can affect the 
cyclists’ infrastructure as well as movement. There are various utilities running longitudinal 
and across the ROW of any category road. These include storm drain, underground and 
overhead electrical lines, gas pipelines, optical fibre cables and others. Usually it is seen 
that an annual maintenance is required which involves roadwork and therefore disruption of 
movement of traffic for a temporary period. In such a case, the location and depth of laying

these utilities is of utmost importance. Also, for a segregated cycling facility, since the paving 
is rigid, it is not desired to locate the services/utilities, which require frequent maintenance.

8  Bicycle  Parking
Parking facilities for cyclists have to be an integral component in the bicycle infrastructure if it 
is to be usable. It is essential to retain the mainstream cyclists of today as cyclists of tomorrow.

These commuters should be provided similar facilities/provisions as car users enjoy. Good 
parking facilities also help attract new users and thereby promote cycling. There is always a 
confusion to understand the terms parking and storage of bicycles. Internationally, parking 
is leaving a vehicle stationary other than during immediate boarding or alighting or during 
loading and unloading. Storing is placing a bicycle in a bicycle storage facility. A bicycle 
parking facility means a bicycle parking system (a structure intended to have one or more 
bicycles placed in or against it), a bicycle storage facility (a delineated and supervised space 
that is intended for placing bicycles) or a combination of them. (CROW, Record 25 : Design 
manual for bicycle traffic, June 2007).
Provision of parking is not a new concept to the Indian sub-continent. Railways stations in 
most of the cities have a bicycle storage facility for commuters who travel to place of work 
using train. In residential areas, to ensure use of bicycles and even attract new bicyclists, 
places of gathering and market areas can have parking facilities. The class of economics is 
really varied for example there are already roads equal to the width of access streets within 
the residential area.
Also rickshaw-parking stands will help others who want to use a rickshaw to travel short 
distances and encourage using non-motorized modes. The advantage of cycle rickshaw 
parking over bicycle parking is that it would not require manning; theft is a very rare case and 
covers a very low share of investment in terms of infrastructure. Since it acts as feeder mode, 
it would cater to short trip lengths of 1.5-2 km, the introduction of frequency of cycle rickshaw 
parking would fairly increase in densely populated residential (passenger rickshaws) and 
commercial areas (passenger and goods rickshaws). The percentage of the space allocated 
for goods rickshaw parking would be higher rather than that of commercial areas. The 
elements of bicycle parking are as follows:
	
1.	
Location: These locations could be at or in proximity of: Transit Stations, 
Places of importance, Junctions/Interchange, Nodes. Measures by the 
government to provide public parking near informal households or slums, 
which also are origin points, would definitely be fruitful to a cycling route and 
the network across the city.
	
2.	
Space/Area: Space allocation is based on the activity survey and the 
existing capacity of the corridor. It is also dependent upon the discretion 
of the designer. Usually, the space allocation should be 20%-30% more for 
optimum use in the future. Capacity requirement needs to be assessed in 
detail.
	
3.	
Theft Control: Theft prevention will definitely promote and increase cycling 
since the users would see it as a safe mode. It should be kept in mind that 
investments to prevent thefts would only lead to increase in number of 
bicyclists and make it an attractive mode to choose.
	
4.	
Manned or Provided: Parking facilities can be manned or provided. While 
the manned provision needs an extra investment to make it theft free (hire 
security personnel), the latter is providing good fastening locking facilities 
where a place has already been designated.

5.	
Shade: Much needed for the Indian condition, shade is required for parking 
as required by the car users for the same. This could be done by the existing 
natural foliage or by use of temporary structures or other built provisions 
taken into consideration.
Forms of Bicycle Parking: The most popular form currently used in a number of cities is the 
wheel clamps or the inclined wheel braces, used in office properties, schools, metro stations/
railway stations where the risk of theft is quite low. The other types of form of bicycle parking 
facilities used are:
	
1.	
Hanging system bars
	
2.	
Hanging system on walls
	
3.	
Tiered racks – such is used at railway stations where the cyclists travel to 
suburbs for work.
	
4.	
Binder racks
	
5.	
Bolt locking system – frame type/wheel lock
	
6.	
Fastening poles
	
7.	
Support rack
	
8.	
Brace rack
Others, where the volume of bicycle parking is larger are: Canopies and designated parking 
lots

Vertical Curves
Vertical curves at changes of grade shall have a minimum radius of 200 metres for summit 
curves and 100 metres for valley curves. This is applicable for the entire road width and not

Cross Section Design
The main elements (Cycle facility discussed earlier) of a cross section design for a road are 
as follows:
Note:	 In special cases, there are conditions on arterial and sub arterial streets where the ROW gets 
constricted to a minimum of 24 m. In such conditions, the continuity of the NMT and pedestrian 
infrastructure is important without creating a bottle neck in the arterial/sub arterial flow. A 
segregated cycle track and footpath can be easily achieved with 2 lanes in both directions.
