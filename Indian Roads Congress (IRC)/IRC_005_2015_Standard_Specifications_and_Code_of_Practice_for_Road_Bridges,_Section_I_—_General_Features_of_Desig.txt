103  General Provisions
General
The design shall be principally based on the limit state design philosophy. Structural 
components and the connections shall be designed to conform to the requirements of ultimate 
limit state, serviceability limit state and fatigue limit state requirements of the appropriate 
clauses of relevant codes of IRC.
Note :	 Till such time all the IRC codes and standards are changed from Working Stress Philosophy 
to Limit State Philosophy, the design of structural components shall continue to be carried out 
as per the existing codes, which may be still following working stress philosophy.
103.1	
Performance Requirements
Bridge structure and its components shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained 
in such a way that they perform adequately and safely during construction and service life, 
with following performance requirements:
	
a)	
Structural Safety and Serviceability, i.e. ability of a structure or structural 
members to perform, with appropriate levels of reliability, adequately for 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
10
normal use under all combinations of actions expected during construction 
and service life.
	
b)	
Durability, i.e, ability of the structure to perform during design service life, for 
its intended purpose with anticipated maintenance but without major repair 
being necessary.  
	
c)	
Economy, i.e, bridges should have least life cycle cost. 
	
d)	
Sustainability, i.e. ability of a material, structure or structural member to 
contribute positively to the fulfillment of the present needs and the needs of 
future generations. 
Above requirements may be met by
	
a)	
the choice of suitable materials,
	
b)	
appropriate design and detailing,
	
c)	
specifying control procedures for design, production, execution, and use 
relevant to the particular project and
	
d)	
appropriate choice of span arrangement and construction methodology.
103.2	
Structural Safety & Serviceability
Structural safety is ability of a structure and its structural members to guarantee the overall 
stability, adequate deformability and ultimate bearing resistance, corresponding to the 
assumed actions (both extreme and/or frequently repeated actions and accidental and/or 
exceptional events) with appropriate levels of reliability for the specified reference periods. 
The structural safety shall be analyzed for all possible damage states and exposure events 
relevant for the design situation under consideration;
In the context of performance-based Limit State Design, performance criteria for serviceability 
and structural safety are specified by:
	
a)	
Serviceability limit state criteria 
	
b)	
Ultimate limit state criteria 
Limit state shall be related to design situations. They may relate to persistent situations 
during the service life of the works, transient situations during the construction stage as 
well as repair stage, extreme actions and environmental influences, including earthquakes. 
Design principles with respect to the performance-based Limit State Design for structural 
safety and serviceability as given in relevant design codes of IRC may be adopted.
Serviceability limit state corresponds to the state beyond which specified performance 
requirements for a structure or a structural component are no longer met.
Ultimate limit state is the limit state associated with the structural collapse leading to loss of 
life, damage to structure and environment and disruption of operation. Ultimate limit state may 
arise due to structural components reaching their ultimate strength, fatigue or instability.

103.3	
Economy
Economy in bridge design would generally depend upon structural type, span lengths, 
materials and method of construction, which shall be selected on the basis of life cycle cost. 
Costs of structural alternatives should be worked out based on long term considerations 
including inspection, maintenance and repair/replacement. Therefore, cost of future 
expenditure on repair and maintenance during the whole service life of bridges should be 
accounted for. Construction cost shall take into account regional factor such as availability of 
material and labour, fabrication, location, shipping and erection constraints. Cost on account 
of mitigation of social and environmental impact shall also be taken into account in working 
of cost comparison. Efforts shall be made to optimize the life cycle cost.
103.4	
Sustainability and Loading Considerations
The structures shall contribute towards sustainable development by effective mitigation of 
social and environmental impacts.
The loads, special local conditions and traffic intensity for which a bridge is to be designed, 
shall be prescribed by the authorities as per relevant clauses of IRC:6.
Utilities or services, if any, to be carried over the bridge and if so, nature thereof (e,g. Telephone 
Cables, OFC ..etc.) and relevant information regarding size, arrangement etc. shall be taken 
as per the requirements or as directed by the authorities.
104  Planning Considerations
Planning of a bridge is essential to create a facility which will comply with various technical, 
administrative, environmental and social requirements including financial justifications and 
will serve the intended purpose. All requisite information and data shall be collected for proper 
planning of a bridge project.
104.1	
Planning Strategies
104.1.1	
Integration with Road Network
The first step in the planning of a bridge project is to ascertain its location in the link of the 
road network and function thereof. The bridge shall fit into the road link in a seamless manner 
and contribute to its primary function. Most road links have both mobility and accessibility 
functions in varying degrees, which shall be taken into account while planning.
104.1.2	
Interaction with other Authorities and Public
It is necessary to interact with authorities and local public who are directly or indirectly 
connected with the project or whose works or authority will be directly or indirectly affected.
104.1.3	
Siting of a Bridge
104.1.3.1	 River bridge
	
a.	
A bridge should ideally be sited across the narrowest width of the river or 
channel where the course of the channel is straight in considerable length 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
12
on both up-stream and down-stream sides of the site and the banks are 
stable having no history of being out-flanked. A bridge should not be sited 
across meandering stretches of rivers unless it is established that the banks 
at the bridge site are the nodal points of the river (i.e. the river has a history 
of touching these points year after year regardless of change in its course 
elsewhere). Where one of the banks is not well defined and gets over-topped, 
the option of training the river by construction of a guide bund can also be 
considered. In case the active channel of the river, especially the alluvial 
rivers, changes its course within the river basin, the option of training the 
river by construction of guide bunds on both banks can be considered after 
ensuring that the adjoining areas in the upstream do not get flooded or the 
guide bunds themselves are not under attack. The preliminary site selection 
can be based on information contained in the topographical sheets of the 
Survey of India, supplemented by actual survey or study of satellite images 
of the location, which can be obtained from the National Remote Sensing 
Agency. A model study may be required for bridging rivers having undefined 
cross section and huge flood plains.  
	
b.	
The cardinal principles to be kept in view at the time of selection of a particular 
bridge site including river training works are to provide a suitable crossing 
consistent with safety and economy and acceptable detour from the existing 
road alignment. The following shall be the guiding considerations in this 
regard:
	
i)	
Bridges up to a length of 60 meters - The location shall be governed by 
suitability of alignment of road, unless there are special problems at the 
crossing with regard to design and maintenance of the bridge.
	
ii)	
For bridges having a length between 60 m and 300 m - Suitability of 
site of the bridge as well as that of the alignment of approaches shall 
be considered together.
	
iii)	
For bridges having a length more than 300 m - The requirement of a 
good site for the bridge shall have the precedence and the alignment of 
approaches will have to conform to the selected bridge site.
	
c.	
A brief description of the reasons for selection of a particular site for the 
crossing should be prepared for record, which shall include typical cross-
sections of the channel at all alternative sites investigated and rejected.
104.1.3.2	 Grade separators and underpass
The layout of a grade separator or an Underpass is determined by the alignment and geometry 
of intersecting roads or traffic, road classification and degree of segregation required.
104.1.3.3	 Bridges in hilly & coastal regions
	
a)	
For bridges in high altitude, where the road is likely to pass through snow 
bound areas and avalanche prone slopes, snow removal and avalanche 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
13
control should be one of the factors to be considered in the planning stage of 
the road and bridges. Specialist literature and publications shall be referred 
to for dealing with such cases.
	
b)	
The coastal bridges are susceptible to highly corrosive environment, 
storm surge or tsunami and strong cyclonic winds. Specialist literature and 
publications shall be referred in absence of any relevant IRC standards.
104.1.3.4	 Approaches
A length of at least 50 m of approaches on either side of the bridge/grade separator or the 
defined length up to the end of approach gradient, whichever is larger, shall form part of 
bridge/grade separator planning. The approaches of a flyover may comprise series of viaduct 
spans for openness in inhabited locality or wall type structures in remote areas.

104.1.5	
Safety
The bridge and its approaches shall be planned to ensure safety of the user and the structure 
in accordance with Clause 105.2. 
104.1.6	
Initial Environmental Examination

the proposed bridge on environment. The most likely impacts are as under:
	
a)	
Increase in submergence of surrounding area
	
b)	
Likelihood of river bank erosion
	
c)	
Possibility of siltation

Effects on historic monuments and heritage structures
 
f) 
Impact on conservation of wild life, flora and fauna 
	
g)	
Impact on surroundings
104.1.7	
Aesthetics
All bridges and grade separators should be aesthetically pleasing as it has a large impact 
on the surroundings. Considerations shall be given to various aspects mentioned in 
Clause 112.
104.1.8	
Economic Evaluation
The economic evaluation of different alternatives of a bridge project shall be carried out 
to determine its relative viability. In some cases, social requirements may prevail over the 
economic considerations.

Data Regarding Existing Bridges
104.3	
Width of Carriageway, Footpath and Median
104.3.1	
Width of Carriageway and Overall Width
For high level bridges constructed for the use of road traffic only, the width of carriageway 
shall not be less than 4.25 m for a single lane bridge, 7.5 m for a two-lane bridge and shall be 
increased by 3.5 m for every additional lane of traffic for a multiple lane bridge. If a median/
central verge is constructed in a wide bridge thus providing two separate carriageways, the 
carriageway on each side of the median shall provide for at least two lanes of traffic and 
width thereof shall individually comply with the minimum requirements stipulated above. For 
a bridge on a horizontal curve, the roadway width shall be increased suitably to conform to 
the requirements stipulated in the relevant IRC Standards.
104.3.2	
Width between the outermost faces of the bridge shall preferably be equal to 
the full formation width of the approaches. However in case of bridges having length more 
than 60 m in non-urban areas, reduced width may be permitted by the authorities subject to 
stipulations as given in Clause 104.3.1 above.
104.3.3 
Vented causeway/submersible bridges shall cater for at least two lanes of traffic.
104.3.4	
Width of Bridge carrying combined highway/Mass Rapid Transport System 
(MRTS)/Railway corridor.
For bridges carrying combined road and rail or any other special type of traffic, the widths 
indicated in above clause shall be suitably increased.



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
15
104.3.5	
Width of Median
The median width of the approach road shall generally be carried over the bridge. In case 
of major bridges, the median width may be reduced, subject to a minimum width of 1.2 m, in 
which case, crash barriers shall be provided in the median.
104.3.6	
Width of Footpath
When a footpath is provided, its clear width shall not be less than 1.5 m. For urban and 
populated areas having large concentration of pedestrian traffic, the width of the footpath 
shall be suitably increased.
104.4	
Clearances
104.4.1	
Clearance - Navigational
Navigational clearances, both vertical and horizontal, shall be provided based on classification 
of waterway as per the requirements of Inland Waterway Authority of India (IWAI) or the 
concerned Port authorities.
104.4.2	
Clearance – Over Roads
104.4.2.1	 Vertical
The minimum vertical clearance of any structure provided over the project road shall be 
5.0 m for non-urban areas and 5.5 m in case of urban areas.
In case of structures over local or collector streets, where only light commercial vehicles 
are plying and where alternative routes for heavy commercial vehicles and fire tenders are 
available within a short distance, the authorities may relax the clearance requirements stated 
above.
At locations where over-dimensional vehicles are frequently plying, the authorities may 
consider providing increased vertical clearance.
For project roads carrying footways and cycle tracks, a minimum vertical clearance of 
2.25 m shall be provided.
104.4.2.2	 Horizontal
While fixing the horizontal clearance, consideration shall be given to safe passage of vehicles 
on or under a bridge. The minimum clear width between any obstruction shall not be less than 
that of the approach roadway section, including shoulders or Kerbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
No object, other than a road kerb or a crash barrier, should be located closer than 600 mm 
to the edge of carriageway.
For a bridge constructed on a horizontal curve with superelevated road surface, the horizontal 
clearance shall be increased on the side of the inner kerb by an amount equal to 5 meters 
multiplied by the super elevation. The minimum vertical clearance shall be measured from 
the super elevated level of the roadway. Extra horizontal clearance required for the super 
elevation will be over and above the increase in width required on a curve.

104.4.3	
Clearance -  Over Railway Lines
For ROBs across railway lines, horizontal and vertical clearances shall be governed by the 
requirements of the Railway authority.
104.5 
Span Configuration
105  Geometric Design Considerations
Choice of a particular span arrangement and the type of structure depends upon several 
factors such as site characteristics, type of sub-soil strata, height and length of the bridge, 
riding quality, design and, constructability considerations, availability of construction material 
and technology etc. In case of urban flyovers, considerations of aesthetics and other functional 
requirements like openness in inhabited portions, may have overriding effect for viaduct 
spans vis-à-vis solid-fill portion for approaches.
105.1	
General
Geometric design for the bridge including immediate approach roads should essentially include 
integration of vertical and horizontal alignment of the bridge with the highway geometry and 
should broadly cover the following:
	
a)	
Preparation of Plan - showing the horizontal alignment horizontal curves, 
overall width, width of carriageway, footpath, median, crash barrier, railing, 
shoulders, side drains, right of way, etc.
	
b)	
Preparation of Vertical Profile - showing the vertical alignment, grade line, 
vertical curves, high flood level, ground/bed profile etc.
	
c)	
Preparation of Cross-sections - showing the carriageway, cross camber/
super elevation, side slopes, median, footpath, hydraulic details, structural 
arrangement, type of superstructure, substructure and foundation, abutment 
details, protection works, details of return walls, retaining walls etc.
105.2	
Safety Considerations
105.2.1	
Protection to User
Railings/Crash Barriers shall be provided along the edges of structures conforming to the 
requirements stated elsewhere in the code. Footpaths and cycle tracks adjacent to the 
carriageway shall have crash barrier in between, to safely redirect the errant vehicular 
traffic.
105.2.2	
Protection to Structure Against Vehicle Collision
Consideration shall be given for safe passage of vehicles on or under a bridge.  The hazard 
of being hit by errant vehicles within the clear zone should be minimized by locating structural 
components at a safe distance from the line of users and/or by providing suitable protection 
to the structural components.  



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
17
105.2.3	
Protection to Structure Against Barge Impact
For bridges on streams where barges are plying, the bridge structure shall be protected 
against vessel collision forces by fenders, protection islands or any other means. Alternatively, 
the structural system shall be designed to withstand collision force effects as specified in 
relevant IRC Code.
105.3	
Horizontal and Vertical Alignments
Horizontal and vertical alignments of road bridges shall conform to relevant IRC Code. While 
finalizing the horizontal and vertical alignment for the bridge portion, following aspects shall 
be considered:
105.3.1	
To the extent practicable, the alignment of roadways shall be selected to make 
bridge crossing as nearly square as possible.
105.3.2	
Wherever the bridge is in curvature, effort shall be made to provide constant 
curvature within the bridge portion of the highway. Sudden change of radii and curvature 
over the bridge shall be avoided to the extent possible.
105.3.3	
Skew Angle in any Bridge should Preferably not Exceed 30º.
105.3.4	
In situations where a replacement/new bridge is to be constructed, adjacent to an 
existing structure, width of the gap between the two bridges shall be decided on the basis of 
clearance between the foundations. Not less than 2.5 m clear gap should be provided at any 
place between the two bridges to allow for working space.
105.3.5	
Locating bridges on vertical sag curves shall be avoided as far as possible, as 
vehicle dynamic effects are increased and appearance is adversely affected.
105.3.6	
For bridges, a minimum longitudinal gradient of 0.3% is desirable to provide for 
drainage of deck.
105.3.7 
In case of divided carriageways, finished road levels at the median for both the 
carriageways shall preferably be same at any cross section.
105.3.8	
The combined effect of horizontal and vertical alignments and changes in super 
elevation shall be considered with regard to the appearance of the bridge structure, especially 
in urban situations. 
105.3.9	
The alignment chosen in hilly roads should enable the ruling gradient to be attained 
in minimum length, besides, minimizing steep gradients and, hairpin bends and avoiding 
needless rise and fall. 
105.3.10	 A single vertical curve shall be provided for bridges having total length upto 
30 m.
105.4	
Design Speed
Design speed over the bridge shall be consistent with the design speed on the approach 
roads. A single design speed should preferably be adopted for the entire bridge structure.  In 
case, however, differential design speed is unavoidable due to presence of sharp curvatures 



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 53

in specific zones within the bridge, transitions between sections with different Design Speeds 
shall be designed as per relevant IRC codes.
105.5	
Longitudinal Gradient and Cross Slope
105.5.1	
The maximum longitudinal gradient on bridge shall be consistent with the gradient 
of the approach roads as per relevant IRC codes.
105.5.2	
The cross slope on bridge deck shall be consistent with the cross slope of the 
adjoining roadway.
105.5.3	
During exiting a bridge, consideration shall be given to stopping sight distance, 
especially where bridge approaches are constructed close to intersections.
105.6	
Super-Elevation
105.6.1	
The super elevation and additional widening on the deck of a bridge on a horizontal 
curve shall be provided in accordance with the relevant IRC code.
105.6.2	
Transition from normal cross slope to full super elevation shall be avoided over a 
bridge as far as possible.
105.7	
Approaches to Bridge
105.7.1	
The approaches on either side of the bridge for a length of at least 15 m shall 
continue to have the same horizontal profile as that provided for the bridge. This length may 
be suitably increased where necessary to provide for the minimum sight distance for the 
design speed. However, in difficult geometric situations, the minimum length of approaches 
with same horizontal profile may not be insisted upon, provided user’s safety concerns are 
not compromised.
105.7.2	
Where horizontal curves have to be provided on the approaches, beyond the 
straight portion on either side, the minimum radius of curvature, the super elevation and 
transition length for various speed and curve radii shall be provided in accordance with 
stipulations contained in relevant IRC Codes.
105.7.3	
If there is a change of gradient in the approaches, suitable vertical curves shall be 
introduced conforming to stipulations contained in relevant IRC Codes.
106  Hydrology and Hydraulic Design
106.1	
Data collection for hydraulic design shall be made in accordance with 
Clause 104.2 of the Code.
106.2	
Determination of Design Highest Flood Level
106.2.1 
The design flood level shall be decided on the basis of data collected during 
reconnaissance survey, aerial survey, satellite maps, detailed survey and hydrological and 
hydraulic studies and analyses made.



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
19
106.2.2	
Design Highest Flood Level shall be the Highest of the following :
 
a) 
The highest of flood levels as obtained from local enquiries from aged 
persons. Such local enquiries should be made at 3 different locations at 
site.
	
b)	
Level of the highest watermarks, left on different old structures or the erosion 
marks on the banks
 
c) 
Highest flood level that will be able to pass the design discharge as determined 
from other sources as per clause 106.3
 
d) 
The highest of the levels after considering the effects of confluence, 
backwater and HFL because of merger of or into any other river in the 
influence zone upstream or downstream of site.
	
e)	
The highest level as corroborated from the records of HFL available for 
existing bridges, other structures like dams and spillways and gauge stations 
etc. on the river in upstream or downstream direction.
 
f) 
Effect of any new structure planned for future in the influence zone of the 
stream.
106.3	
Determination of Design Discharge
106.3.1	
The design discharge for which the waterway of the bridge is to be provided, shall 
be based on maximum flood discharge of return period of 100 years. In case where the 
requisite information is not available, the design discharge shall be the maximum estimated 
discharge determined by consideration of the following or any other rational method.
106.3.1.1	 From the records of discharge observed in the stream at the site of the bridge, 
or at any other site in its vicinity i.e., the discharge taken for design at any other bridge site 
and any other irrigation structures like dam or spillway or Gauge Station on this river in the 
upstream direction.
106.3.1.2	 From the rainfall and other characteristics of the catchment:
	
i)	
By the use of an empirical formula, applicable to that region, provided 
that empirical formula can predict the maximum discharge for given return 
period. 
	
ii)	
By a recognized method, provided it is possible to evaluate, for the region 
concerned, the various factors employed in that method.
106.3.1.3	 From stage discharge curves, if available
106.3.1.4	 By the area velocity method with the help of hydraulic characteristics of the 
channel. In case of the river not confined within banks and flowing in larger widths, the flow 
width should be divided into suitable zones i.e., main flow channel, side flow channel, slow 
channel and stagnant or no flow channel depending upon the characteristics and various 
parameters which should also be considered accordingly for calculation of discharge from 
that zone.

106.3.1.5	 By unit hydrograph method (see appendix-1)
Flood estimation reports in respect of total 21 climatic sub-zones (Appendix-1(a)) in the 
country have been prepared based on the hydro-meteorological data collected for selected 
catchments of areas varying from 25 to 1500 sq.km. and are available with the Director, 
Hydrology (small catchments), Central Water Commission. The methodology recommended 
in the relevant sub-zone report pertaining to a particular region may be followed for 
assessment of maximum discharge for the design of bridges.
106.3.2	
Where possible, more than one method shall be adopted, results compared, and 
the maximum discharge fixed by judgment by the engineer responsible for the design. The 
bridge shall be designed for this maximum discharge. However, for catchment areas covered 
by sub-zones mentioned in Appendix 1(a), the maximum discharge shall be assessed on the 
basis of the flood estimation report for the said sub-zone.
106.3.3	
Various limitations of the methods for computing the Maximum Design Discharge 
correctly under different flow, bed and site conditions and for a given return period, should be 
kept in mind and accounted for adequately while deciding the same.
106.3.4 
For minor bridges, where catchment area cannot be defined, reliance may be kept 
on Area Velocity Method.
106.3.5	
The maximum estimated discharge from the catchment area as calculated above 
or normal peak flood discharge from the dam/spillway if existing or being proposed in the 
upstream of the bridge (to be ascertained from the Irrigation Authorities), whichever is more, 
shall be considered for design of the bridge. 
Freak flood discharges or exceptional discharge of high intensity due to the failure of a dam 
or tank constructed upstream of the bridge need not be catered for.
106.3.6 
In cases where the design discharge cannot be properly quantified and in spill 
zones of rivers known for flash floods, the abutments may also be designed and detailed as 
‘piers’ for possible future extension.
106.4	
Discharge for Design of Foundation and Protection Works
To provide for an adequate margin of safety, the foundation and protection works shall be 
designed for a larger discharge than the design discharge given in Clause 106.3, for which 
reference may be made to the provisions contained in relevant IRC Codes.
106.5	
Determination of Waterway
106.5.1	
Linear Waterway
106.5.1.1 For natural channels in alluvial beds but with well defined banks and for all natural 
channels in beds with rigid in-erodible boundaries, the linear waterway shall be distance 
between banks at HFL, at which the designed maximum discharge determined in accordance 
with Clause 106.3, can be passed.
106.5.1.2 For natural channels in alluvial beds and having undefined banks, the linear 
waterway shall be determined from the design discharge using some accepted rational 



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
21
formula at the discretion of the engineer responsible for the design. One such formula for 
regime conditions is:
 
 
 
W 
=  
C√(Q) 
Where,
	
W	
=	
regime width in meters (equal to effective linear waterway under regime 
	
condition)
 
Q 
= 
the maximum design discharge in m3/sec;
	
C	
= 	  a constant usually taken as 4.8 for regime channels but it may vary from 
	
4.5 to 6.3 according to local conditions.
106.5.1.3	 The formula which is applicable for alluvial soils in regime conditions, should not 
be applied for clayey, bouldery or such strata. The waterway in such cases should be decided 
on the basis of study and analysis of site and flow conditions by adopting some rational 
approach (like performance of existing bridge nearby, on the same river).
106.5.1.4 In meandering flood plains and in deltaic regions, the waterway proposed may 
be as in above clauses, but guide bunds, flood embankments or other river training works 
should be provided to train the river to flow through the bridge. Hydraulic or Mathematical 
model studies may be required to ascertain the flow conditions, and design parameters for 
the training works and the required waterway.
106.5.1.5 If the river is of a flashy nature and the bed does not submit readily to the scouring 
effects of the flood, the linear waterway should be determined by the area velocity method, 
taking into account the design flood level and its water spread, the characteristics of the bed 
materials and the water surface slope.
106.5.1.6	 In a hilly terrain, the minimum waterway under the bridge should be kept same as 
the linear waterway at HFL.
106.5.1.7	 In sub-hilly terrain/trough terrain, waterway should be decided after carefully 
studying the past history of river behavior and flow conditions, as river is usually unstable 
and changing course periodically resulting in a fan shaped delta type formations, requiring 
more waterway than normally required by formula.
106.5.1.8	 In case a new bridge is to be constructed, close to an existing bridge for the 
purpose of widening or providing extra carriageway, the waterway provided in the new bridge 
should usually be kept the same as in the old bridge unless there are specific reasons. If the 
waterway is to be kept different, then bridges should be provided with smooth inlet and outlet 
transitions.
106.5.1.9 For artificial channels (irrigation, navigation and drainage), the linear waterway 
should be adequate to pass the full discharge at designed velocity, but concurrence shall 
invariably be obtained from the authority controlling the channel. If it is proposed to flume 
the channel at the site of the bridge, this fluming shall be subject to the consent of the same 
authority and in accordance with the essential requirements.
106.5.1.10 The waterway, as worked out from the formula or decided otherwise, should be 
compared with linear waterway at HFL corresponding to the design flood discharge and the 



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
22
difference in the two should be analyzed and reconciled before finally deciding the waterway 
to be provided.
106.5.2	
Restricted Waterway
106.5.2.1	 The linear waterway as calculated above can be restricted by careful consideration 
of the resulting effects on flow conditions, scour, afflux and other site condition in the individual 
cases. No restriction in waterway should be considered for well defined and confined flow.
106.5.2.2	 In hilly terrain the linear waterway at HFL should not be restricted because that will 
cause undesirable hydraulic jumps as the flow in such a terrain is usually super critical.
106.5.2.3 For unstable meandering rivers flowing through a number of sub channels 
separated by land or shallow section of nearly stagnant water and having width much in 
excess of the regime width, or channels flowing over large widths with small depths, the 
restriction of waterway may be considered. In such cases, it may be necessary to constrict 
the channel by providing training and protection works to prevent the main channel from 
wandering about freely and for minimizing the resultant oblique attack on bridge foundations 
and approaches. The extent of constriction and the design of training works in such cases 
should, preferably, be decided on the basis of model studies, keeping in view the ultimate 
economy, safety, durability and aiming at optimal recurring maintenance needs of structure 
as well as river training works.
106.5.2.4 In case of bridge being located at bends, curves or oblique to flow, the waterway 
gets restricted. The available waterway normal to the flow should be worked out and this 
should be accounted for in the design.
106.5.2.5 The restriction of waterway will result in afflux on the upstream of bridge. The 
effect of this afflux on the velocity, scour and submergence of surrounding area should be 
considered in the design. The consideration of these effect and comparison of consequent 
costs in the two cases, will decide the limit of restriction in the linear waterway.
106.5.2.6 If the waterway has to be restricted to such an extent that the resultant afflux will 
cause the channel to discharge at erosive velocities, protection against damage by scour 
shall be afforded by providing deep foundations, curtain or cutoff walls, rip-rap, bed pavement 
or other suitable means. 
106.5.3	
Effective Linear Waterway
106.5.3.1	 The linear waterway or restricted waterway worked out as above shall be reduced 
because of the obstruction caused by piers or obliquity of flow in the river at the bridge site.
106.5.3.2	 For calculating the effective linear waterway the width of obstruction due to each 
pier shall be taken as the mean submerged width of the pier and its foundation up to the 
normal scour level. The obstruction at the ends due to the abutments or pitched slopes 
duly protected shall be ignored. For other flow conditions, actual obstruction due to pier and 
foundation normal to the flow should be worked out and considered in design.
106.5.3.3	 Effect of presence of Dams, Barrages, Weirs, Sluice Gates etc. on the hydraulic 
characteristics like causing obliquity and concentration of flow, scour, silting of bed, change 



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
23
in flow levels, bed levels etc. should be studied and analysed while deciding the waterway. 
These should invariably be decided after collection of data from the concerned regulatory 
authorities and after discussions with them.
106.5.3.4	 The effect on linear waterway and hydraulic particulars should be taken care of in 
the design of a bridge, if constructed in the close proximity of an existing bridge.
106.5.3.5	 In case of tidal zones, where it is decided to adopt measures likely to affect the 
volume of the tidal flow and other characteristics of the tide, it shall be ensured that no port 
or harbor or other installations in the proximity of the bridge are adversely affected.
106.6 
Determination of Afflux
106.6.1 
If the waterway is restricted as per Clause 106.5.2, it will cause afflux at the bridge 
and design HFL will accordingly be raised.
106.6.2 
The afflux shall be calculated by using any suitable method based on conservation 
of energy or momentum. In absence of any rigorous method, the afflux may be calculated by 
using Molesworth formula as given below :
	
h	
=	
(V2/17.88 + 0.015) x ((A/a)2 – 1), where :
 
h 
= 
afflux (in meters)
	
V	
=	
average velocity of the water in the river prior to constriction (in m/sec) 
	
A	
=	
unobstructed sectional area of the river at proposed site (in sq. m)
	
a	
=	
constricted area of the river at proposed site (in sq. m)
106.6.3 
The effect of afflux on the velocity, submergence area and scour etc shall be 
worked out and accounted for in the design.
106.7	
Freeboard
106.7.1	
The freeboard for the approaches to high level bridges, where water spreads along 
the approaches, shall not be less than the minimum values specified in relevant IRC code for 
road designs.
106.7.2 
For the aggrading rivers in Himalayan foot-hills and flood-prone areas or North-
Eastern States, North Bengal etc. and where ever required for some specific reason, the 
freeboard shall be suitably increased.
106.8	
Vertical Clearance over HFL
106.8.1	
The vertical clearance shall ordinarily be provided as given in the following 
clauses.
106.8.2 
For openings of high level bridges, which have a flat soffit or soffit with a very flat 
curve, the minimum clearance shall be in accordance with the following table. The minimum 
clearance shall be measured from the lowest point of the deck structure inclusive of main 
girder in the central half of the clear opening unless otherwise specified.

106.8.3	
For arched openings of high level bridges having overhead decking, the clearance 
below the crown of the arch shall not be less than one tenth of the maximum depth of water 
plus one-third of the rise of the arch intrados.
106.8.4	
No part of the bearings shall be at a height less than 500 mm above the design 
highest flood level, taking into account afflux.
106.8.5 
In the case of artificial channels having controlled flows and carrying no floating 
debris, vertical clearances lesser than that specified in Clause 106.8.2 & 106.8.3 above may 
be provided.
106.8.6	
In the case of bridges in sub-mountainous region and across aggrading rivers, 
silting of the bed of the river should also be taken into consideration while fixing the vertical 
clearance.
106.8.7	
In case of bridges across tidal rivers, creeks, sea, the vertical clearance shall be 
provided keeping in view the HTL and normal wave/splash effects.
106.9 
Determination of the Maximum Depth of Scour
106.9.1	
The probable maximum depth of scour to be taken for the purpose of designing 
foundations for piers, abutments and river training works shall be estimated after considering 
all local conditions over a reasonable period of time.
106.9.2	
Wherever possible, soundings for the purpose of determining the depth of scour 
shall be taken in the vicinity of the site proposed for the bridge. Such soundings are best 
taken during or immediately after a flood before the scour holes have had time to silt up 
appreciably. Allowance shall be made in the observed depth for increased scour resulting 
from:
 
i) 
The design discharge being greater than the flood discharge.
 
ii) 
The increase in velocity due to obstruction in flow caused by construction of 
the bridge.
	
iii)	
The increase in scour in the proximity of piers and guide bunds.
106.9.3	
Scour
106.9.3.1	 The following theoretical method may be adopted when dealing with the natural 
channels flowing over scourable beds for the estimation of mean depth of scour ‘dsm’ in 
meters.

Where :
	
Db	
= 	 The discharge in Cumecs per meter width. The value of “Db” shall be the 
	
maximum of the following:
	
i)	
The total design discharge divided by lower of the effective linear 
waterway between abutments or guide bunds, and theoretical 
linear waterway.
 
ii) 
The value obtained taking into account any concentration of flow 
through a portion of the waterway assessed from the study of the 
cross-section of the river. Such modification of the value may not 
be deemed applicable to minor bridges of length upto 60 m.
	
iii)	
Actual observations, if any.
	
Ksf	
= 	 the silt factor for a representative sample of the bed materials obtained 
	
down to the maximum anticipated scour level and is given by the 
 
expression 1.76√dm in case of sandy soils (having particle size between 
	
0.04 mm to 2.00 mm), where “dm” is the weighted mean diameter of the 
	
bed material in mm.
	
	
	
Clayey beds having weighted diameter less than 0.04 mm offers more 
	
resistance to scour than sand. In absence of any accepted rational 
	
formula or any data of scour at the site of the proposed bridge, the 
	
following theoretical calculations may be adopted :
	
i)	
In case of soil having f< 15o and c (cohesion of soil) > 0.2 Kg/cm2, 
‘Ksf’ shall be calculated as follows :
	
Ksf 
= 
F(1+√c), where ‘c’ is in Kg/cm2
Where,
	
F	
=	
1.50 for f> 10º and < 15º
	
   	
=	
1.75 for f > 5º and < 10º
   	
	
=	
2.00 for f < 5º
	
ii)	
Soils having f > 15º will be treated as sandy soil even if ‘c’ is more 
than 0.2 Kg/cm2, and silt factor will be as per provision for sandy 
soil.
Note:
	
i)	
The effective linear waterway shall be determined in accordance with Clause 106.5.3, 
	
and in no case shall exceed the value assessed as per Clause 106.5.1.2. 
	
ii)	
A typical method of determining “dm” is set forth in Appendix-2.
	
iii)	
The value of Ksf to be adopted for the purpose of design should be determined after 
	
laboratory testing of the representative samples of bed materials collected during the 
	
sub-soil exploration.

106.9.3.2 If there is any predominant concentration of flow in any part of waterway due to 
bend of the stream in immediate upstream or downstream or for any other reason, like wide 
variation in type of bed material across the width of channel, then mean scour depth may be 
calculated dividing the waterway into compartments as per the concentration of flow.
106.9.3.3	 Maximum scour depth
The maximum scour depth below the highest flood level (HFL), which is to be considered for 
the purpose of design of foundations, protection works, river training works etc. shall be in 
accordance with relevant IRC Standards, duly taking into account the mean scour depth dsm 
and obstructions due to piers and abutments.
106.9.3.4 If a river is of flashy nature and the bed does not lend itself readily to the scouring 
effect of floods, the formula for dsm given in the Clause 106.9.3.1 shall not apply. In such 
cases the maximum depth of scour shall be assessed from actual observations.
106.9.3.5	 Bridge located across streams having gravel or boulder beds (normally having 
weighted diameter more than 2.00 mm), there is yet no rational formula for determining 
scour depth. However, the formula given in Clause 106.9.3.1 may be applied with a judicious 
choice of value of Db and Ksf and the results compared with the actual observations at the site 
or from experiences on similar structure nearby and their performance and decision taken 
based on sound engineering judgment.
106.9.3.6	 Obstruction in the channel bed, likely to divert the current or cause undue disturbed 
flow or scour and thereby endanger the safety of the bridge, shall be removed as far as 
practicable from within a distance upstream and downstream of the bridge not less than the 
length of the bridge subject to a minimum of 100 meters in each direction. Attention shall be 
given to river training and protection of banks over such lengths of the river as required. In 
case it is not possible to remove such obstructions, its effect on scour shall be considered.
106.10	
River Training and Protection Works
106.10.1	 The slopes, in front of abutments and the portion of bridge approaches falling in 
the flood zone, shall be provided with suitably designed pitching and launching apron.
106.10.2 In case of the uncertain and changing flow conditions, adequate river training 
works shall be provided for protection of banks, embankments and directing the river to flow 
under the bridge.
106.10.3 After collecting the required data, studying and analyzing the river flow conditions 
etc. and necessary model studies, wherever required, the protection works shall be designed 
as per provisions of IRC:89 or other specialist literature.
106.11	
Hydraulic and Mathematical Model Studies
106.11.1	 These Studies should be Carried Out Wherever Necessary, such as :
 
● 
in case of big rivers with large discharge having uncertain and complex flow 
conditions and for other abnormal situations
 
● 
when the linear waterway and scour cannot be accurately calculated or 



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
27
	
● 
when the protection and river training works cannot be designed reliably 
because of the uncertain or complex conditions.
106.11.2	 The studies should be carried out at the reputed, reliable and accredited institutions 
only where requisite facilities are available. 
106.11.3	 The Site and Contour surveys for these studies should be done very carefully, 
with precision and it should be ensured that these along with bed materials are correctly 
represented in the Model.
107  General Design Requirement
107.1 
Structural System and Configuration
The structural scheme, structure type, span arrangement, member size and shape for a 
bridge shall be made considering the following aspects :
	
a)	
Operation and maintenance  requirements
	
b)	
Functional requirements, related to the purpose of the structure
	
c)	
Structural requirements aimed at handling different external actions, such 
as gravity loads, wind, temperature, seismic, barge impact, vehicle collision, 
wave pressure loads, etc.
	
d)	
Construction requirements aimed at completing the construction within the 
stipulated time, with least disturbance to the existing traffic and surrounding 
environment.
	
e)	
Environmental requirements, necessary for achieving sustainability.
	
f)	
Durability requirements, with respect to the design service life.
	
g)	
Aesthetic requirements.
	
h)	
Future widening requirements.
	
i)	
Requirement to reduce energy input by various possible methods (such 
as using less cement and more cementitious substitution with fly ash or 
blast furnace slag, using recycled aggregates, utilizing more industrial 
byproducts,etc.).
	
j)	
Requirement to have construction technology that leads to fast track 
construction.
	
k)	
Encouraging use of Integral or Continuous bridges from consideration of 
riding comfort and long term performance.
	
l)	
Avoiding bridges with sharp plan curvature (i.e. R < 90 m) and with high

107.2	
Bridge Foundation
Bridge foundation can be open, pile or well type. The structural, hydraulic, and geotechnical 
aspects of foundation design shall be coordinated prior to finalization of the conceptual design 
and foundation type. Consideration should be given to the following:
	
a)	
Interdependence of design for foundation, substructure and superstructure.
	
b)	
Type of sub-strata, 
	
c)	
Hydraulic and Hydrological considerations 
	
d)	
Constructability
	
e)	
Effect of protection works on foundation design.
107.3	
Bridge Substructure
 
a) 
Bridge piers can be of various configurations such as wall, circular, trestle or 
any other shape with solid or hollow sections. 
 
b) 
Bridge abutments can be of various configurations such as spill-through type 
and non-spill-through type with solid wall, counter-fort wall, box type or bank 
seat type.
107.4	
Bridge Superstructure
The superstructure can be of various types as given in Clause 102.3 of the code. The choice 
of superstructure would largely depend upon the functional, aesthetic and techno-economic 
criteria, suited to the location of the bridge.
107.5	
Retaining Walls
Wing walls for abridge can be splayed type, at an angle to the bridge axis or return wall 
type, parallel to the bridge axis or it can be cantilever type projecting out of the abutment. 
Reinforced Soil walls or Gabion walls can also be provided as per the site conditions.
108  Construction and Constructability Considerations
108.1	
Constructability Considerations
Constructability considerations aim at optimum use of required construction knowledge and 
experience in planning, design, procurement, and field operations, to achieve overall project 
objectives. Constructability drives consideration of the entire construction process during the 
conceptual design stage. Dimension and reinforcement of components in a bridge, many a 
times are dictated by the construction and erection phase requirements rather than the service 
stage requirements. The design therefore must consider various factors, which influence the 
constructability of the bridge.  A typical check list of factors is given below:
	
-	
Access to work areas and remote areas,
	
-	
Access to emergency vehicles and routine maintenance of site,

Social and Environmental issues,
	
-	
Region e.g. mountainous, proximity to sea, desert, marine clay etc.
	
-	
Height above Water Level/Ground Level.
108.2	
Construction Considerations
108.2.1	
Bridge construction involves managing the entire logistics of construction, including 
construction operations of both permanent as well as temporary works that are needed for 
safe and efficient building of the structures. Efficient construction would require appropriate 
knowledge and experience in planning, design, detailing, procurement of materials and plant 
and equipment, besides site operations to achieve overall project objectives. Construction 
shall be carried out by personnel having appropriate skills to ensure quality as envisaged. 
Adequate supervision and quality control shall be provided during all stages of construction.
108.2.2	
The design process must include the necessary detailing and construction 
knowledge and experience to realize the full potential of construction benefits without 
compromising the integrity of structure or design consideration. The choice of structural 
system and the design and detailing of the structure therefore shall be made by appropriately 
qualified and experienced persons having thorough knowledge of design and construction. 
For many bridges, the design is construction driven, in which case construction methodology 
as considered in design must be reflected in the design drawings and be implemented. In 
case methodology of construction is required to be changed during implementation, due to 
any unforeseen reasons, its impact on design must be investigated and accounted for before 
carrying out construction.
108.2.3	
Suitable materials and methodology of construction including use of suitable 
specialized equipment shall be adopted for completion of bridge within the given time 
frame.
108.2.4	
Design shall consider the method of construction which will be carried out through 
project management, involving, planning, scheduling and controlling including safety, in 
accordance with a work program which is required to be prepared for each bridge project.
	
i)	
Planning commences with the analysis of the type and scope of work to 
accomplish the task as well as the specifications for the work, construction 
methods, materials, equipment and man power.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
30
	
ii)	
Scheduling establishes a sequence of operations and accounts for inter 
relation of operations at the job site as well as allocation of man power, 
material and equipment.
	
iii)	
Controlling consists of procuring materials as per construction sequence 
and stage, dictating overall construction procedures, inspection and test 
procedure and maintaining complete records of daily progress etc. In order to 
ensure proper quality of work, a suitable quality plan needs to be developed 
before taking up construction.
	
iv)	
Safety during construction will include safety of various operations 
encompassing the safety of works, work personnel, equipments as well as 
traffic in the work zone.
109  Auxiliary Components
109.1	
Provision for Utilities
109.1.1 
A bridge structure shall cater for fixtures for electric posts, lamp posts and suitable 
ducts for carrying electric cables etc. as required to cater for utility services.
109.1.2	
Utility services like cables and pipelines for water, gas, petroleum products directly 
on bridge structure should be avoided. These may be placed on a structure supported on 
piers and abutments.
109.1.3	
While planning, there is need for proper accessibility of the services utilities for 
inspection and maintenance without hindrance to traffic movements.
109.2	
Drainage
109.2.1	
General
The bridge deck and its immediate highway approaches shall be designed to provide safe 
and efficient conveyance of surface run-off, in a manner that causes minimum damage to 
the bridge and ensures safety of the passing vehicle. Transverse drainage is achieved by 
providing a suitable camber or super elevation, sufficient for positive drainage.
109.2.2	
Bridge Deck Drainage
Drainage spouts shall be provided at suitable spacing, depending upon the width of 
carriageway, to drain off the water from the carriageway during rains. For wider carriageways 
having width more than 3 lanes in each direction, special design of deck drainage 
(including extra roughening of the deck surface) may be needed to reduce the potential for 
hydroplaning.
The underside of the outside edge of bridges shall be designed with continuous drip grooves 
to prevent staining of the surface. In case of bridges across a stream or a river, the rain water 
can discharge into the river bed through drainage spouts provided at suitable spacing. The 
surface drainage collected at deck drain locations shall be directed through the superstructure 
by individual vertical or near-vertical deck drain pipes.



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
31
In situations, where it is not possible to discharge into the underlying water course, 
consideration should be given to conveying the water in a longitudinal storm drain affixed to 
the underside of the bridge and discharging it into appropriate facilities on natural ground at 
bridge ends.
Runoff from the bridge deck at the abutments shall be intercepted either immediately beyond 
the end of the bridge approach slab or before the end of the curb or barrier, by catch basins 
or other suitable means. The water so intercepted shall be directed past the embankment 
slopes and abutments in order to control embankment erosion.
Discharge from deck drains shall be channelled by means of down pipes and downspouts 
to locations that can be protected from erosion. Down-take pipes, wherever provided, shall

paths or navigation channels. Changes in direction in down-take pipes shall be not greater 
than 45º. Cleanouts shall be provided near bends or at intervals to permit access to all parts 
of a downpipe system.
109.2.3	
Storm Water Drainage Design
The design of the drainage system involves:
 
a) 
Estimation of the run-off flow rate using rational method &
	
b)	
Fixing the slope and dimension of the drain to have adequate capacity to 
carry the discharge and afford proper maintenance.
Reference shall be made to special literature/IRC code for design.
109.2.4	
Drainage at the Foot of Flyovers
Due to the longitudinal slope of ramp of a flyover, there is a tendency for the rain water to 
flow in longitudinal direction rather than in cross direction resulting in very large quantity of 
water reaching the valley curve area where it meets the ground level road. Suitable system 
of drainage shall be adopted to avoid ponding in such cases.
109.2.5	
Drainage for Underpasses
For underpasses, the possibility of designing the storm water drainage based on gravity flow 
shall be the first choice. In case the surrounding levels do not permit a gravity based system 
of drainage, suitable arrangement for pumping the water shall be provided.
109.3

Suitable type of noise barriers shall be provided at select sensitive locations (e.g. near 
hospitals, academic institutions etc.) to mitigate the impact of excessive noise generated by 
road traffic.
110.  Illumination
110.1	
All bridges should have provision for illumination. Provision for cabling, mounting 
and installation of luminaries shall be considered in design and detailing. Support system 
provided for the bridge lighting shall be adequately designed for the expected loadings. The 
support system shall be detailed so that it does not sacrifice the kerb and crash barrier running 
profile, maintaining its continuity. The support system, mountings and other fixtures required 
for illumination of the bridge shall not impair the functionality of other road furniture. 
110.2	
Illumination plan for bridges, grade separators, under-passes and interchanges 
shall be considered during initial planning. The arrangement of the masts/poles i.e. its height 



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
37
and spacing, should be such as to achieve the following values of Average Maintained 
Luminance, Eav:
 
• 
Main Carriageway    
= 
50 lux
 
• 
Footpath/Cycle Track 
= 
20 lux
 
• 
Underpass                 
= 
70 lux
Minimum Uniformity Ratio, Emin/Eav shall not be less than 0.5, where Emin is the minimum 
luminance in the area. 
Maintenance factor, which is the ratio of average illumination on the working area, given by 
an installation with decreased effectiveness due to dust, pollution, line voltage drop, ageing 
of lamp, product tolerance etc., to that of a new installation shall be considered as 0.75
110.3	
While deciding the illumination plan, consideration shall be given to energy 
efficiency, environmental pollution, aesthetic and economical aspects. The selection of 
lighting system and the layout should add to the overall aesthetic of the bridge.  
110.4	
The installation, lighting arrangement, method of control, switches etc. shall 
conform to the provision contained in IS: 1944. 
110.5	
Adequate lighting shall be provided at specific locations, such as loops, ramps, 
signal free interchanges, merging zones, rotaries, pedestrian crossing etc.  Ramps and 
approaches should be lit to the same level as main lanes. 
110.6	
At highway interchanges, different lighting arrangements, viz. lighting Poles or 
high masts or combination of both, may be considered and the one which gives optimum 
results from the view points of aesthetics, safety, illumination and ease of maintenance may 
be adopted. 
110.7	
Illumination levels for the vehicular and pedestrian subways/underpasses may be 
kept the same as those on the approaches at either end of the subway/underpass. 
110.8	
At night, the level of luminance in a subway/underpass, should be constant and 
equivalent to the level on the road leading into the subway/underpass. However, since there 
is a high level of external light during the day, it is necessary to increase the level of luminance 
at the entrance of the subways/underpasses, mainly to avoid a black hole effect leading to 
a reduction in visual perception. At the exit of subways/underpasses, the level of luminance 
should also be increased to avoid drivers being subjected to glare effects by the light outside. 
Thus the illumination layout of a subway/underpass shall be planned considering the various 
zones (viz. Threshold, Transition, Interior and Exit zones). A symmetric or pro-beam lighting 
systems shall be used except in the transition zone where it may be counter beam type.
Wherever feasible the vehicular/pedestrian/cattle underpasses in remote areas should have 
provision of skylight to get the light inside underpass during the day.
111.  Road Signs and Signals
Appropriate plan for road markings, signage, delineation and signals (where necessary) 
shall be made and integrated with the overall bridge planning. These should be provided 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
38
on bridges, flyovers grade separators and their approaches to facilitate smooth and safe 
movement/operation of traffic without creating any confusion among users and also to 
minimize the possibilities of serious damage to the bridge structure or any of its components 
in the event of accidents. Provisions should be made in the structures for supporting of 
signals, signages and delineators. 
111.1	
Road Markings
	
a)	
The road marking symbols, patterns, sizes, colour and legends shall be 
adopted in accordance with Code of Practice for Road Marking, IRC:35. 
	
b)	
Where the number of lanes on the bridge and on approaches are different 
(e.g. a two lane bridge on a three lane approach or vice versa), a transition 
taper should be given. The excess carriageway width in the transition zone 
should be appropriately chevron marked to ensure that it does not form part 
of the traveled way. There should be a corresponding sign as well to indicate 
narrowing or widening of carriageway. 
	
c)	
Hazard markers and/or crash cushions shall be provided at beginning of 
median or crash barrier clearly indicating start of a bridge/flyover or loop 
emerging from main carriageway. 
	
d)	
Chevron Markings/Painted Islands shall be provided at all exits to slip roads 
from main highway before a bridge/flyover or vice versa. 
111.2	
Signals
 
a) 
Signals, near or on the bridges, shall be provided as per specific requirement 
of the any particular project, conforming to the requirements of IRC:93.
	
b)	
Signals can be either electrically operated or solar powered. 
	
c)	
Flashing beacons shall be provided at the beginning of median or crash 
barrier, clearly indicating start of a bridge/flyover or loop emerging from main 
carriageway. Provision of cables for power supply to any such signal shall be 
considered in addition to the regular illumination.
111.3	
Road Signs
	
a)	
All multi-lane bridges, complex interchanges and grade separated structures 
shall be provided with overhead signs, well in advance and, if required, 
on the structure, conforming to the provision specified in IRC:67. Only 
retro-reflective signs shall be permitted. Non-Luminous signs, shall not be 
permitted.
	
b)	
The location of sign board, barrier kerbs and supporting system should be 
designed and planned along with the project and detail of the scheme shown 
in a drawing drawn to a scale of 1:500.
	
c)	
Support system for signs and signals required on bridge decks shall 
preferably be placed behind rigid type crash barriers. The sign supports shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
39
be structurally safe and properly anchored to the bridge deck. The bridge 
deck shall be designed to withstand all such loads. 
	
d)	
Wherever signs are to be illuminated or signals to be operated, necessary 
arrangements shall be made for cable ducts. 
111.4	
Delineators
Delineators (also referred to as guideposts) shall be provided as per safety requirements. 
These shall be installed along the side of the roadway in a series to indicate the alignment of 
the roadway. Delineators are particularly beneficial at locations where the alignment might be 
confusing or unexpected, such as at lane reduction, transitions and curves. 
112.  Aesthetics
112.1	
Bridges have large visual impacts on their surroundings. To achieve aesthetically 
pleasing view of bridge and its surroundings, it is essential that attention should be paid to 
produce a clear, simple, well-proportioned structure form, blending harmoniously with its 
surroundings. Larger the length of a bridge, greater is its visual impact. Therefore, specialists 
in architecture and landscaping may be engaged for bridges having lengths of 500 m or 
more. 
112.2	
Bridges should complement their surroundings, be graceful in form and present 
an appearance of adequate strength. Bridge designers must, therefore, consider appearance 
as an important design consideration. Attention should be given to appearance while looking 
towards the bridge as well as that while moving on the bridge.
112.3	
The visual appeal of the bridge can be attributed to its form, texture, colors and 
other details. Every visible component of a bridge has a role to play. Aesthetics of a bridge 
must be considered both in the conceptual planning stage as well as in the detailed design 
stage. 
112.4	
Considerations at Conceptual Planning Stage of a Bridge
Geometry, layout and concept are major determinants of appearance and should be 
addressed at the initial stages of a project. Following points shall be given due consideration 
at the conceptual stage of the project: 
112.4.1	
Simplicity
Generally bridges seem aesthetically more pleasing if they are simple in form, superstructure 
are sleek in proportion to their spans, the lines of the structure are continuous and the shapes/
sizes of the structural members reflect the flow of forces. 
112.4.2	
Dimensions and Proportions
Dimensions of various elements should generally develop harmony with the surrounding 
landscape and environment. 



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
40
112.4.3	
Symmetry of Structure
Symmetrical bridges are often more aesthetically pleasing than non-symmetrical bridges, 
except in specific cases.
112.4.4	
Order and Rhythm
Developing a rhythm in a bridge is also important. The cumulative effect of all bridge elements 
including lighting poles, barrier supports and piers should be considered. 
112.4.5	
Unity of Design
Various elements viz. parapets, safety barriers, light poles, deck, pier, approaches, immediate 
landscape and all the associated signage etc. are integral elements of the whole bridge 
design and should be considered in unison.
112.4.6	
Form or Appearance in Totality
Visual forms of bridges, viaducts or flyover structures etc. should be selected with care to be 
in harmony with the general landscape and local architecture. 
112.5	
Considerations at Design Stage of a Bridge
The following points shall be given due consideration with respect to various components 
during design stage. This section deals with the basic elements that form a bridge structure. 
It deals with each element as a separate component. However, the designer must never lose 
sight of how each unit fits into the overall expression that is desired.
112.5.1	
Parapet
The outer face of the parapet can be one of the most important aesthetic elements of a 
pleasing bridge and often the most dominant in long distance views. The top of the parapet 
should slope towards the road, to channel rainwater onto the bridge, minimizing staining of 
the outside face. Treatment of fascia elevation by using serrations (grooves)/physical breaks 
or by changing relative brightness using surface slopes can make the bridge look slender 
than it really is. If the deck soffit is visually complex, consideration may also be given to hiding 
this complexity, by extending the parapet soffit below the deck soffit.
112.5.2	
Girder Elevation
Haunched girders are expressive and responsive to the forces in the bridge. They can 
often be more distinctive and elegant than single depth beams. Abrupt changes in depth of 
superstructure should be avoided and be made gradual with flowing lines
112.5.3	
Girder Cross Section
The major visual design goals of the superstructure are apparent slenderness, continuity of 
lines and relationship with the substructure. The cross sectional shape of the girder should 
be considered keeping in view the effect of light, shade and texture.
112.5.4	
Scale and Proportions
The structure should be in scale with its surroundings as well as with other parts of the 
structure. The primary structural elements, e.g., span lengths, girder depth, pier and abutment 



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
41
heights, should have good proportional relationships to each other and their structural chore. 
Generally, no single element should dominate the visual composition. The collective design of 
the structure should be in scale with the site and environmental considerations. The structure 
form should have an appearance of lightness.
112.5.5	
Pier Cross Section
Pier shapes will be largely influenced by the span arrangement, width of superstructure, 
height of piers and the nature of surroundings. When bottom section of pier is influenced by 
ground level conditions (e.g. median verge of a flyover) special shapes varying along height 
should be considered. 
112.5.6	
Pier Caps
Pier cap width and length are influenced by functional considerations but its visual integration 
with the pier below and deck above must receive the due attention. 
112.5.7	
Abutments
In an open landscape setting, spill through or bank seat abutments are generally preferable, 
as walled abutment structures can block views. If unavoidable the use of plantation should 
be considered to hide the abutment walls. 
112.5.8	
The space around and under the bridge must be given due consideration as 
aesthetic aspect of the bridge depends a lot upon the beauty of its surroundings. 
112.6	
Standard details when used need to be reviewed for their appropriateness to each 
project. They should be regularly updated.
112.7	
New bridges generally become part of a family of other bridges along a route. The 
impact and relationship to this family should be considered. The new bridge should respect 
the role, form and design of the existing parallel bridge. 
113.  Operation & Maintenance
A structure will properly serve its intended design life only when it is regularly inspected and 
maintained in accordance with the IRC codes and guidelines. 
Proper attention shall be given to ensure all critical components of the structure can be properly 
accessed and inspected. Therefore, proper access/arrangement for inspection of bearings, 
anchors, interior of box girders and the like, should be thought of at design stage. Bearing 
replacement scheme, where applicable, shall be planned at design stage and corresponding 
forces should be considered while designing various components of the bridge. 
A maintenance manual shall be prepared for the bridge project.
Exposed parts of steel structures shall be accessible for inspection and periodic painting. 
Design documentation shall include indicative procedures for replacement as well as repair 
of bridge components, like bearings, corroded anchors, expansion joints, drainage spouts 
etc.

 APPENDIX- 1
Clause 106.3.1.5
UNIT HYDROGRAPH METHOD
The Unit Hydrograph, frequently termed as the unit graph, is defined as the hydrograph of 
storm run-off at a given point in a river, resulting from an isolated rainfall of unit duration 
occurring uniformly over the catchment and producing a unit run-off. The unit run-off adopted 
is 1 cm depth over a catchment area.
The term “Unit-Rainfall Duration” is the duration of rainfall excess resulting in the unit 
hydrograph. Usually, unit hydrographs are derived for specified unit durations, say, 6 hours, 
12 hours etc., and derived unit hydrographs for durations other than these are converted 
into unit hydrographs of the above unit durations. The duration selected should not exceed 
the period during which the storm is assumed to be approximately uniform in intensity over 
various parts of the catchment. A 6 hours unit duration is suitable and convenient for studies 
relating to catchments larger than 250 sq.km.
The unit hydrograph represents the integrated effects of all the basin constants, viz., drainage 
area, shape, stream pattern, channel capacities, stream and land slopes.
The derivation and application of the unit hydrograph is based on the following principles:
 
1) 
All the characteristics of the catchment of a river a reflected in the shape of 
the hydrograph of run-off.
	
2)	
At a given point on a river for all storms having the same duration of rainfall 
excess above this point and uniformly distributed with respect to time, the 
discharge ordinates of the hydrograph are proportional to the total volumes 
of storm run-off. This implies that rainfall excess of, say 2 cm, within the 
unit of duration will produce a run-off hydrograph having ordinates twice as 
great as those of the unit hydrograph. Also, if individual hydrographs are 
obtained from separate periods of uniform rainfall excess that may occur 
throughout a storm period, and these are properly arranged with respect 
to time, the ordinates of the individual hydrographs can be added to give 
ordinates representing the total storm run-off hydrograph for the entire storm 
period.
Three methods are generally available for giving unit hydrographs at any point in a river.
	
i)	
By analysis of rainfall and run-off records for isolated unit storms;
	
ii)	
By analysis of run-off compound hydrographs;
 
iii) 
By computation of synthetic unit hydrographs, when sufficient rainfall and 
run-off data are not available.
The determination of design flood, after the unit hydrograph has been derived, involves the 
following steps:



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 53
======================================================================
IRC:5-2015
43
	
a)	
Division of catchment into sub-areas, if necessary.
	
b)	
Derivation of design storm and its apportionment to sub-area.
	
c)	
Determination of minimum retention rate and calculation of rainfall excess of 
design storm.
	
d)	
Arrangement of design storm
	
e)	
Application of rainfall excess to unit hydrographs for each sub-area.
 
f) 
Routing of flood for each sub-area to the point of collection of the whole 
catchment.
A rational determination of critical design storm for a catchment requires a comprehensive 
study of major storms recorded in the region and an evaluation of effects of local conditions 
upon rainfall rate. This is particularly necessary in the case of design storms, covering a large 
area of several thousand square kms.
In the case of areas less than a few thousand square kms, certain assumptions can be 
made regarding rainfall patterns and intensity variations without being inconsistent with 
meteorological causes. They simplify design-storm estimation, but would entail high degree 
of conservation.

Clause 106.9.3.1
TYPICAL METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF WEIGHTED  
MEAN DIAMETER OF PARTICLES (dm)
Representative disturbed samples of bed materials shall be taken at every change of strata 
upto the maximum anticipated scour depth. The sampling should start from 300 mm below 
the existing bed. About 500 gms of each of the representative samples so collected shall be 
sieved by a set of standard sieves and the weight of soil retained in each sieve is taken. The 
results thereof are then tabulated. A typical test result is shown below (Tables I & II).
