FOUNDATIONS AND SUBSTRUCTURE
BACKGROUND
The "Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges" Section VII -
Foundations and Substructure was
first published
in July 1980 as Part
I - General
Features of Design. Later first revision was published in December, 1983 incorporating
Part
II and Amendments 1,2 and 3 to Part
I as Unified Code. The second revision
of this code was undertaken by the Foundation and Structure Committee (B-4) and
the
initial draft was finalized by the Committee under the Convenorship of Shri R.H.
Sarma
. Subsequently, the draft was reconsidered and discussed in various meetings
by the reconstituted Foundation, Substructure and Protective Works Committee (B-4)
under Convenorship of Shri S.A Reddi. The final draft as approved by Convenor BSS
Committee was subsequently approved by the Executive Committee
in
its meeting
held on 30.8.2000.
It was later approved by the Council
in
its 160th meeting held at
Kolkata on 4.11.2000 for publishing the revised IRC Code Section VII: IRC: 78:2000.
Since then numerous amendments and errata were published to this Code based on
development in design and construction technology.
The
current Revised
Edition
of IRC:78
includes
all
the amendments and
errata
published from time to time upto December, 2013.
The Revised Edition of IRC:78 "Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road
Bridges" Section VII - Foundation incorporating all amendments and Errata published
till date was approved by Foundations and Substructure Foundation Substructure
Protective Works and Masonry Structures Committee (B-3)
in
its meeting held on
1 6.1 0.201 3. The Revised Edition of IRC:78 was approved by the Bridges Specifications
and Standards Committee in its meeting held on 06.01 .2014 and Executive Committee
held on 09.01.2014 for publishing.

IRC:78-2014
700 SCOPE
This code deals with the design and construction of foundations and substructure
for road bridges. The provisions of this code are meant to serve as a guide to both
the design and
construction
engineers,
but mere compliance with the
provisions
stipulated herein will not relieve them in any way of their responsibility for the stability
and soundness of the structure designed and erected.
701 TERMINOLOGY
The following definitions shall be applicable for the purpose of this code.
701.1
Abutment
The end support of the deck (superstructure) of a bridge, which also retains earth,
fill of
approaches behind fully or partly.
701.1.1
Box type abutment and return wall
When the return walls on two sides are integrated with abutment and a back wall parallel to
abutment is provided at the end of returns with or without additional internal wall along or
across length, this structure is called box type abutment and return wall, or end block.
701.1.2
Non-load bearing abutment
Abutment, which supports the end span of less than 5 m.
701.1.3
Non-spill through abutment
An abutment structure where the soil is not allowed to spill through.
701.1.4
Spill through abutment
An abutment where soil is allowed to spill through gaps, along the length of abutment, such
as, column structure where columns are placed below deck beams and gap in between
is
free to spill earth. (Spilling of earth should not be permitted above a level of 500 mm below
the bottom of bearings).
701.2
Afflux
The rise in the flood level of the river immediately on the upstream of a bridge as a result of
obstruction to natural flow caused by the construction of the bridge and
its approaches.

PAGE 14 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
701.3
Balancer
A bridge/culvert like structure provided on embankment to allow flow of water from one side
of the embankment to other side, for purpose of avoiding heading up of water on one side
or for avoiding blocking the entry to the other side.
701.4
Bearing Capacity
The supporting power of soil/rock expressed as bearing stress
is referred to as
it bearing
capacity.
701.4.1
Allowable bearing pressure
It
is the maximum gross pressure intensity at which neither the
soil
fails
in shear,
(after
accounting
for appropriate
factor
of safety)
nor there
is excessive
settlement beyond
permissible limits, which
is expected to be detrimental to the structure.
701 .4.2
Net safe bearing capacity
it
is
the
net
ultimate
bearing
capacity
divided
by
a
factor
of safety as
per Clause
706.3.1.1.1.
701 .4.3
Net ultimate bearing capacity
It is the minimum net pressure intensity causing shear failure of the soil.
701 .4.4
Safe bearing capacity
The maximum pressure, which the soil can carry safely without risk of shear failure and
it
is equal to the net safe bearing capacity plus original overburden pressure.
701 .4.5
Ultimate gross bearing capacity
It
is the minimum gross pressure intensity at the base of the foundation at which the soil
fails in shear.
701.5
Bearing Stress
701 .5. 1
Gross pressure intensity
It is the total pressure at the base of the foundation on soil due to the possible combinations
of load and the weight of the earth
fill.

701.9
Piles
701.9.1
Bearing/friction piles
A pile driven or cast-in-situ for transmitting the weight of a structure to the founding strata
by the resistance developed at the pile base and by friction along
its surface.
If
it supports
the load mainly by the resistance developed at its base,
it is referred to as an end-bearing
pile, and
if mainly by friction along
its surface, as a friction pile.
701 .9.2
Bored cast-in-situ pile
A pile formed with or without a casing by boring a hole in the ground and subsequently filling
it with plain or reinforced concrete.
701 .9.3
Driven cast-in-situ pile
A pile formed
in the ground by driving a permanent or temporary casing, and filling
if with
plain or reinforced concrete.
701.9.4
Driven pile

ii) The minimum vertical clearance above the HFL already determined as per IRC:5
need not be increased due to larger discharge calculated above.
703.2
Mean Depth of Scour
The mean scour depth below Highest Flood Level (HFL) for natural channels flowing over
scourable bed can be calculated theoretically from the following equation:
1
d = 1.34/-^) 3
sm
\KsJ
Where
Db =
The design discharge for foundation per metre width of effective
waterway.
K
sf =
Silt factor for a representative sample of bed material obtained upto
the level of anticipated deepest scour.
703.2.1
The value
of Db may be determined by
dividing the design discharge
for
foundation by lower of theoretical and actual effective linear waterway as given in IRC:5.
703.2.2
'K
sf
' is given by the expression
1 J6jd^ dm being the weighted mean diameter
in millimetre.

No
rational formula
or data
for determining scour depth
for bed
material
consisting of gravels and boulders (normally having weighted diameter more than 2.00 mm)
and clayey bed
is available.
In absence of any data on scour for such material, the mean
scour depth may be calculated following the guidelines given in Appendix-1.
703.2.3
If there is any predominant concentration of flow in any part of waterway due to
bend of the stream in immediate upstream or downstream or for any other reason, like, wide
variation of type of bed materia! across the width of channel, then mean scour depth may be
10



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
calculated by dividing the waterway into compartments as per the concentration of flow.
703.2.4
In case of bridge mainly adopted as balancer, the mean scour depth 'dsm
' may
be taken as (Highest Flood Level-Lowest Bed Level) divided by 1.27.
703.2.5
Scour depth may be determined by actual observations wherever possible.
This is particularly required for clayey and bouldery strata. Soundings, wherever possible,
shall be taken
in the vicinity of the site for the proposed bridge and for any structures
nearby. Such soundings are best during or immediately
after a flood before the scour
holes have had time to be silted up. The mean scour depth may be fixed based on such
observations and theoretical calculation.
703.3
Maximum Depth of Scour for Design of Foundation
703.3.1
The maximum depth of scour below the Highest Flood Level (HFL) for the design
of piers and abutments having individual foundations without any floor protection may be
considered as follows.
703 .3.7.7
Flood without seismic combination
i)
For piers
-
2.0 dsm
ii)
For abutments
-
a)
1 .27 dsm with approach retained or lowest
bed level whichever is deeper.
b) 2.00 d
with scour all around.
'
sm
703 .3 . 7 . 2
Flood with seismic combination
For considering load combination of flood and seismic loads (together with other appropriate
combinations given elsewhere) the maximum depth of scour given in Clause 703.3.1 .1 may
be reduced by multiplying factor of 0.9.
703.3.1.3
For low water level (withoutflood conditions) combined with seismiccombination
maximum level of scour below high flood level can be assumed as 0.8 times scour given in
Clause 703.3.1.
NOTE
:
In respect of viaduct/ROB having no possibility of scour, resistance of soil may be
considered below depth of excavation for services construction,
or 2.0 m below
ground level whichever is greater.
703.3.2
For the design
of floor protection works
for
raft or open foundations, the
following values of maximum scour depth may be adopted:
i)
In a straight reach
1 .27 dsm
ii)
In a bend
1.50 dsm or on the basis of concentration of flow
11



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
The length of apron on upstream may be 0.7 times of the same on downstream.
703.4
Special studies should be undertaken for determining the maximum scour
depth for the design of foundations
in
all situations where abnormal conditions, such as,
the following are encountered:
i)
a bridge being located on a bend of the river involving a curvilinear flow, or
excessive shoal formation, or
ii)
a bridge being located at a site where the deep channel in the river hugs to
one side, or
iii)
a bridge having very thick piers inducing heavy local scours, or
iv) where the obliquity of flow in the river is considerable, or
v)
where a bridge
is required to be constructed across a canal, or across a
river downstream of storage works, with the
possibility of the relatively
clear water inducing greater scours, or
vi) a bridge in the vicinity of a dam, weir, barrage or other irrigation structures
where concentration of flow, aggradations/degradation of bed,
etc. are
likely to affect the behavior of the structures.
vii) An additional tow-lane bridge when located near to the existing bridge, on
major rivers.
NOTE:
These studies shall be conducted for the increase discharge calculated vide Clause
703.1.1.
703.5
If a
river
is of a flashy nature and bed does not lend
itself readily to the
scouring effect of floods, the theoretical formula for dsm and maximum depth of scour as
recommended shall not apply.
In such cases, the maximum depth shall be assessed from
actual observations.
704 SUB-SURFACE EXPLORATION
704.1
Objectives
The objectives of the sub-surface exploration are:
i)
During Preliminary Investigation Stage
As a part of site selection process to study existing geological maps and other
information,
previously
prepared
and
available
site
investigation
reports,
known data of nearby structures,
if any, surface examination about river bed
and banks, etc., which will help in narrowing down of sites under consideration
12



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
for further studies for project preparation stage.
ii)
Detailed Investigation Stage
To determine the characteristics of the existing geo-materials, like, soil, rock,
bed material
in water courses, etc.
in the zone of influence of the proposed
bridge sites in such a way as to establish the design parameters which influence
the choice and design details of the various structural elements, especially the
foundation type.
iii)
During Construction Stage
To confirm the characteristics of geo-materials established
in stage
(ii) based
on which the design choices are made and to re-confirm the same or modify to
suit the conditions met at specific foundation locations.
704.2
Zone of Influence
Zone of influence mentioned
in Clause 704.1
(ii)
is defined as the
full length of the bridge
including portion of wing/return wall and part of approaches covering, (but not restricted to),
the full flood zone for water courses, and upto depth below proposed foundation levels where
influence of stresses due to foundation is likely to affect the behaviour of the structure, including
settlement, subsidence under ground flow of water, etc. The width of the land strip on either
side of the proposed structure should include zones
in which the hydraulic characteristics of
river water are likely to be changed affecting flow patterns, scour, etc.
704.3
Methods of Exploration
A large variety of investigative methods are available. A most suitable and appropriate
combination of these shall be chosen. Guidelines for choice of types of investigations,
properties
of geo-materials
that need
be
established,
the
in-situ
testing,
sampling,
laboratory
testing
are
given
in Appendix-2.
This may be
further supplemented
by
specialized techniques depending on the need.
705 DEPTH OF FOUNDATION
:
705.1
General
The foundation shall be designed to withstand the worst combination of loads and forces
evaluated
in accordance with the provisions of Clause 706. The foundations shall be
taken to such depth that they are safe against scour or protected from
it. Apart from this,
the depth should also be sufficient from consideration of bearing capacity, settlement,
liquefaction potential, stability and suitability of strata at the founding level and sufficient
depth below
It.
In case of bridges where the mean scour depth 'dsm'
is calculated with
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
Clause 703.2, the depth of foundation shall not be less than those of existing structures
in the vicinity.
705.2
Open Foundation
705.2.1
In soil
The embedment of foundations in soil shail be based on correct assessment of anticipated
scour considering the values given under Clause 703.
Foundation may be taken down to a comparatively shallow depth below the bed surface
provided good bearing stratum
is available, and the foundation
is protected against scour.
The minimum depth of open foundations shall be upto stratum having safe bearing capacity
but not less than 2.0 m below the scour level or the protected bed level.
705.2.2
In rocks
For open foundations resting on rock, the depth of rock, which in the opinion of the geological
expert is weathered or fissured, shail be excluded in deciding the depth of embedment into
the rock existing below. Where foundations are to rest on credible rocks, caution shall be
exercised to establish the foundation
level at sufficient depth, so as to ensure that they
do not get undermined, keeping
in view the continued erosion of the bed. After allowing
for conditions stipulated above the minimum embedment of the foundations into the rock
below shall be as follows, which in case of sloping rock profile can be provided by properly
benching the foundations.

UCS of more than 12.5 MPA or where
it is not possible to take
core to get the UCS but extrapolated SPT N value
is more
than 500
0.6 m
b)
For rock of moderately weak and below in table 2 of classifi-
cation of rock (under clause 8.2 of appendix 2) having
UCS <
1 2.5 MPA but > 2.5 MPA or where
it is not possible
to take core to get the UCS but extrapolated SPT N value is
more than 100 but less than 500

Well foundations shall be taken down to a depth which will provide a minimum grip of 1/3
rd the
maximum depth of scour below the design scour level specified in Clause 703.3.
705.3.2
In rocks
As far as possible, the wells shall be taken by all the methods of sinking including pneumatic
sinking (where considered necessary), dewatering, etc. to foundation level and shall be evenly
seated
all around the periphery on sound rock
(i.e., devoid of fissures, cavities, weathered
zone, likely extent of erosion, etc.) by providing adequate embedment. The extent of seating
and embedment in each case shall be decided by the Engineer-in-charge keeping in view the
factors mentioned above to ensure overall and long-term safety of the structure.
It is advisable
to make a sump (shear key) of 300 mm
in hard rock or 600 mm
in soft rock inside the well by
chiseling/blasting. Diameter of sump may be
1 .5 to 2 m less than inner dredge-hole subject to a
minimum size of
1 .5m
. Six dowel bars of 25 mm dia deformed bars may be anchored
1 .5 m in
rock and projected 1.5 m above. These may be anchored in minimum 65 mm dia boreholes and
grouted with 1:172 cement mortar.
705.4
Pile Foundations
705.4.1
In soil, the minimum depth of foundations below the point of fixity should be the
minimum length required for developing full fixity as calculated by any rational formula.
705.4.2
In rocks, the
pile should be taken down to rock strata devoid of any likely
extension of erosion and properly socketed as required by the design.
706.1.1

to the ratio of individual shear rating of a support to the sum of the shear ratings of all the
supports. Shear rating of a support
is the horizontal force required to move the top of the
support through a unit distance taking
into account horizontal deformation of the bridge,

======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
706.3. 1. 1.2
For open foundations and well foundation resting on rock, the allowable bearing
pressure on rock may be decided upon not only on the strength of parent rock but also on
overall characteristics particularly deficiencies, like, joints, bedding planes, faults, weathered
zones,
etc.
In absence of such details or analysis of overall characteristics, the value of
factor of safety based on unconfined compressive strength of the parent rock may be taken
as 6 to 8 unless otherwise indicated on the basis of local experience. The allowable bearing
pressure, thus, obtained
is to be further restricted to not over 3 MPa for load combination
(i)
given
in Clause 706.1.1. For Factor of safety
in case of pile foundation the clause 709.3.2
shall be referred
The intermediate geo-materia! like disintegrated weathered or very soft rock may be treated
as soil.
706.3.2
Allowable settlement/differential settlement
706.3.2.1
The
calculated
differential
settlement between
the foundations
of simply
supported spans shall not exceed
1
in 400 of the distance between the two foundations from
the consideration of tolerable riding quality unless provision has been made for rectification
of this settlement.
706.3.2.2
In case of structures sensitive to differential settlement, the tolerable limit has
to be fixed for each case separately.
706.3.3
Permissible tension at the base of foundation
706.3.3. 1
No tension shall be permitted under any combination of loads on soils.
706.3.3.2
In case of rock
if tension
is found to be developed at the base of foundation,
the base area should be reduced to a size where no tension will occur and base pressure
is recalculated. The maximum pressure on such reduced area should not exceed allowable
bearing pressure. Such reduced area shall not be less than 67 percent of the total area
for load combination including seismic, or impact of barge, and 80 percent for other load
combinations.

707.1.1
Provision of the Clause under 707 shall apply for design of isolated footings
and, where applicable, to combined footings, and rafts.
707.1.2
Open foundations may be provided where the foundations can be laid
in a
stratum which
is inerodible or where the extent of scour of the bed
is reliably known. The
foundations are to be reliably protected by means of suitably designed aprons,
cut-off

For solid wall type substructure with one-way reinforced footing, the bending
moments can be determined as one-way
slab
for the
unit width subjected
to worst
combination of loads and forces.
707.2.2.2
For two-way footing, bending moment at any section of the footing shall be
determined by passing a vertical plane through the footing and computing the moment
of the forces acting over the entire area of footings one side of the vertical plane. The
19

In case of circular footings or polygonal footings, the bending moments
in
the footing may be determined in accordance with any rational method. Methods given by
Timoshenko and Rowe for Plate Analysis are acceptable.
707.2.2.4
For combined footings supporting two or more columns, the critical sections for
bending moments along the axis of the columns shall be at the face of the columns/walls.
Further, for determination of critical sections for bending moments between the column/
walls, any rational method of analysis be adopted.
707.2.3
The shear strength of the footing may be checked at the critical section which
is the vertical section at a distance
'd' from the face of the wall for one-way action where
'd' is the effective depth of the section at the face of the wall.
707.2.3.1
For two-way
action
for
slab
or
footing,
the
critical
section
should
be
perpendicular to plan of slab and so located that its perimeter is minimum, but need not
approach closer than half the effective depth from the perimeter of concentrated load or
reaction area.
707.2.4
To ensure proper load transfer, a
limiting value of ratio of depth to length/
width of footing equal to
1:3
is specified. Based on
this,
for sloped footings the depth
effective at the critical section shall be the minimum depth at the end plus 1/3
rd of the distance
between the extreme edge of the footing to the critical section for design of the footing for
all purposes.
707.2.5
The
critical section for checking development length of reinforcement bars
should be taken to be the same section as given
in Clause 707.2.3 and also
all other
vertical planes where abrupt changes in section occur.
707.2.6
Tensile reii iforcei
i lent
707.2.6. 1
The tensile reinforcement shall provide a moment of resistance at least equal
to the bending moment on the section calculated in accordance with Clause 707.2.2.
707.2.6.2
The
tensile
reinforcement

distributed across
the corresponding
resisiting section as below:
a)
In one-way
reinforced
footing,

in two-way reinforced rectangular footing, the reinforcement
in the long
direction shall be distributed uniformly across the full width of the footing.
For reinforcement in the short direction, a central band equal to the short
side of the footing shall be marked along the length of the footing and
portion of the reinforcement determined in accordance with the equation
given below shall be uniformly distributed across the central band:
Reinforcement in centra! band

Total Reinforcement in short direction
'
Where
/3 = the ratio of the long side to the short side of the footing
The remainder of the reinforcement shall be uniformly distributed
in the
outer portions of the footing.
d)
In the case of a circular shaped footing, the reinforcement shall be provided
on the basis of the
critical values of radial and circumferential bending
moments
in the form
of
radial and
circumferential
steel.
Alternatively,
equivalent orthogonal grid can be provided.

more than 300 mm. This steel may be considered to be acting as tensile reinforcement on
that face,
if required from the design considerations.
707.2.9
In case of piain concrete, brick or stone masonry footings, the load from the
pier or column shall be taken as dispersed through the footing at an angle not exceeding 45°
to vertical.
707.3
Open Foundations at Sloped Bed Profile
707.3.1
Open foundations may rest on sloped bed profile provided the stability of the
slope is ensured. The footings shall be located on a horizontal base.
707.3.2
For the foundations adjacent to each
other, the pressure coming from the
foundations laid on the higher level should be duly considered on the foundations at the
lower level due to the dispersions of the pressure from the foundation at the higher level.
The distance between the two foundations at different levels may be decided in such a way
to minimize this effect taking into account the nature of soil.

Construction
707.4. 1
The protective works shall be completed before the floods so that the foundation
does not get undermined.
707.4.2
Excavation on open foundations shall be done after taking necessary safety
precautions for which guidance may be taken from IS 3764.
707.4.3
Where blasting
is required
to be done for excavation
in
rock, and
is
likely
to endanger adjoining foundations or other structures, necessary precautions, such as,
controlled blasting, providing suitable mat cover to prevent flying of debris, etc. shall be
taken to prevent any damage.
7 07 .4 .4
Condition for laying of foundations
707.4.4. 1
Normally, the open foundations should be laid dry and every available method
of dewatering by pumping or depression of water by well point, etc. may be resorted to. A
levelling course of 100 mm thickness in M 10 (1:3:6) shall be provided below foundation.
707.4.4.2
If
it
is determined before-hand that the foundations connot be
laid dry or
the situation
is such that the percolation
is too heavy for keeping the foundation dry, the
foundation concrete may be laid under water only by tremie pipe.
In case of flowing water
or artesian springs, the flow shall be stopped or reduced as far as possible at the time of
placing of concrete. No pumping of water shall be permitted from the time of placing of
concrete upto 24 hours after placement.
707.4.5
All spaces excavated and not occupied by abutments, pier or other permanent
works shall be refilled with earth upto the surface of the surrounding ground, with sufficient
allowance for settlement. All backfill shall be thoroughly compacted and
in general,
its top
surface shall be neatly graded.
707.4.6
In case of excavation in rock, the trenches around the footing shall be filled-up
with concrete of M 15 grade upto top of the rock.
707.4.6.1
If the depth of fill required
is more than 1.5 m in soft rock or 0.6 m in hard rock
above the foundation level, then concrete may be filled upto this level by M 15 concrete and
portion above may be filled by concrete or by boulders grouted with cement.
707.4.6.2

shall be considered upto the bottom of footing. The load of filling need not be considered in
stability calculations
708 WELL FOUNDATIONS
708.1
General
708.1.1
Foundations
supporting
the
superstructure
located
in deep water cannels
shall comprise of properly dimensioned caissons preferably having a single dredge hole.
While selecting the shape,
size and type
of well, the size of abutment and
pier to be
accommodated, need for effecting streamline flow, the possibility of the use of pneumatic
sinking, the anticipated depth of foundation and the nature of data to be penetrated should
be kept
in view. The minimum dimensions of dredge-hole shall not be less than 3 m.
In
case there is deep standing water, properly designed floating caissons may be used as per
Clause 708.12.
However, in case of larger bridges across rivers in wide flood plains prone to scour, delta/
tidal rivers, channels with inland waterway traffic and bridges in coastal/marine locations,
the number of intermediate foundations shall be reduced as far as practicable.
708.1.2
If the external diameter of single circular well exceeds 12 m then Engineer-
in-charge may take recourse to any of the following:
a)
Stress in steining shall be evaluated using 3-Dimensional Finite Element
Method (3D FEM) or any other suitable analytical method.
b)
Stiffening by compartments may be done
for the single
circular well.
Design of such
stiffened wells
shall
call
for supplemental design and
construction specifications,
c)
Twin D-shaped well may be adopted
708.1.3
The
conditions
arising
out
of sand
blow,
if
anticipated,
should
be
duly
considered when circular well
is analysed using 3D FEM/suitable analytical method or
stiffened circular wells are used.
708.1.4
Bottom plug of well should be suitably designed to resist maximum upward
force acting on
it during construction following plugging as well as during
life span of the
structure.
708.2
Well Steining
708.2.1
Thickness of the steining should be such so that
it
is possible to sink the
well without excessive kentledge and without getting damaged during sinking or during
23



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
rectifying the excessive tilts and shifts. The steining should also be able to resist differential
earth pressure developed during sand blow or other conditions, like, sudden drop.
Stresses
at various
levels of the
steining should be within
permissible
limits under
all
conditions for loads that may be transferred to the well.
Use of cellular steining with two or more shells or use of composite material in
well steining shall not be permitted for wells upto 12 m diameter.
Steining thickness
708.2.3.1 The minimum thickness of the well steining shall not be less than 500 mm and
satisfy the following relationship:
h
=
KdVT
h
= minimum thickness of steining in m
d
= external diameter of circular well of dumb bell shaped well or in case of
twin D wells smaller dimension in plan in metres
/
= depth of wells
in metre below top of well cap or LWL whichever is more
(for floating caisson 7
' may- be taken as depth of well
in metres below
bed level).
K - a constant
Value of K shall be as follows:
i)
Well in cement concrete
K = 0.03
ii)
Well in brick masonry
K = 0.05
iii) Twin D wells
K = 0.039
708.2.3.2
The minimum
steining thickness may be varied from above
in following
conditions:
Strata
Variation from
fbe
minimum
Recommended
variation upto
a) Very soft clay strata
Reduced
10%
b) Hard clay strata
Increased
10%
c) Boulder strata or well resting on
rock involving blasting
Increased
10%
24



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 110
======================================================================
SRC:78-2014
708.2.3.3
However, following aspects may also be considered depending on the strata:
a)
Very soft clay strata: Main criteria for reduction in steining thickness is
to prevent the well penetrating by
its own weight. When the thickness
is
so reduced, the steining shall be adequately reinforced, to get sufficient
strength.
b)
Hard clay strata: Depending on the previous experience, the increase
in steining thickness may be more than 10 percent.
c)
Bouldery strata or well resting on rock involving blasting: higher
grade of concrete, higher reinforcement, use of steel plates in the lower
portions, etc., may be adopted.
708.2.3.4
The recommended values given
in Clause 708.2.3.2 can be further varied
based on local experience and
in accordance with decision of Engineer-in-charge.
708.2.3.5
If specialised methods of sinking, such as, jack down method, are adopted
then
the
steining
thickness may
be
adjusted
according
to
design
and
construction
requirements.
708.2.3.6
Any variation from dimensions as proposed
in Clause 708.2.3.1 should be
decided before framing the proposal.
708.2.3.7
When the depth of well below well cap
is equal to or more than 30 m, the
thickness of the steining of the well calculated as per Clause 708.2.3 may be reduced
above scour level in a slope of
1
horizontal to 3 vertical such, that the reduced thickness of
the steining should not be less than required as per Clause 708.2.3 for the depth of well
upto scour level with the reduced diameter.
The reduction
in thickness shall be done
in the outer surface of the well The diameter of
inner dredge hole shall be kept uniform.
The minimum steel and the concrete grade
in the slope portion shall be same as for the
steining below scour level.
Minimum development length of
all the vertical steel bars shall be provided beyond the
minimum section as shown in the Appendix-3 (Fig.
1).
The stress in the reduced section of steining shall also be checked.
708.3
Design Considerations
708.3.1
The external diameter of the brick masonry wells shall not exceed 6 m. Brick
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
masonry wells for depth greater than 20 m shall not be permitted.
708.3.2
For brick masonry wells, brick not less than Grade-A having strength not less than
7MPa- conforming to IS 1077 shall be used in cement mortar not leaner than 1:3.
708.3.3
For plain concrete wells, vertical reinforcements (whether mild steel or deformed
bars)
in the steining shall not be less than 0.12 percent of gross sectional area of the actual
thickness provided. This shall be equally distributed on both faces of the steining. The vertical
reinforcements shall be tied up with hoop steel not less than 0.04 percent of the volume per
unit length of the steining, as shown in the Appendix-3 (Fig. 2).
708.3.4
In case where the well steining
is designed as a reinforced concrete element,
it shall be considered as a column section subjected to combined axial load and bending.
However, the amount of vertical reinforcement provided
in the steining shall not be less
than 0.2 percent (for either mild steel or deformed bars) of the actual gross sectional area
of the steining. On the inner face, a minimum of 0.06 percent (of gross area) steel shall
be provided. The transverse reinforcement in the steining shall be provided in accordance
with the provisions for a column but in no case shall be less than 0.04 percent of the volume
per unit length of the steining.
The horizontal annular section of well steining shall also be checked for ovalisation moments
by any rational method taking account of side earth pressures evaluated as per Clause
708.4.
708.3.5
The vertical bond rods in brick masonry steining shall not be less than 0.1 percent
of the cross-sectional area and shall be encased
into cement concrete of M 15 mix of size
1 50 mm x 1 50 mm. These rods shall be equally distributed along the circumference in the middle
of the steining and shall be tied up with hoop steel not less than 0.04 percent of the volume per
unit length of the steining. The hoop steel shall be provided in a concrete band at spacing of 4
times of the thickness of the steining or 3 metres, whichever is less. The horizontal RCC bands
shall not be less than 300 mm wide and
1 50 mm high, reinforced with bars of diameter not less
than 10 mm placed at the corners and tied with 6 mm diameter stirrups at 300 mm centres, as
shown in the Appendix-3 (Fig. 3).
708.3.6
The stresses in well steining shall be checked at such critical sections where
tensile and compressive stresses are likely to be maximum and also where there is change
in the area of reinforcement or in the concrete mix.
708.4
Stability of Well Foundations
708.4.1
The stability and design of well foundations shall be done under the most critical
26



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
combination of loads and forces as per Clause 706. The pressure on foundations shall satisfy
the provisions of Clause 706.
708.4.2
Side earth resistance
708.4.2.1
The
side
earth
resistance may be
calculated as
per guidelines given
in
Appendix-3. The use
of provisions IRC:45 may be used
for
pier well foundations
in
cohesionless soil.
708.4.2.2
The side earth resistance shall be ignored
in case of well foundations resting
on rock.
If rock strata is such that the allowable bearing pressure is less than
1
IVIPa, then
the side earth resistance may be taken into account.
708.4.3
Earth pressure on abutments
708.4.3.1
If the abutments are designed
to
retain earth and not
spilling
in
front, the
foundations
of such abutments
shall be designed
to withstand the
earth
pressure and
horizontal forces for the condition of scour depth in front of 1.27 d sm with approach retained
and 2 dsm with scour all around.
In case of scour all around, live load may not be considered.
708.4.3.2
However, where earth spilling from the approaches
is reliably protected
in
front,
relief due to the
spilling earth
in front may be considered from bottom of well cap
downwards.
708.4.4
Construction stage
708.4.4. 1
Stability of the well shall also be checked for the construction stage when there
is no superstructure and the well
is subjected to design scour,
full pressure due to water
current and/or full design earth pressure as in the case of abutment wells.
708.4.4.2
During the construction of wells when
it has not reached the founding
level
or has not been plugged, the wells are likely to be subjected to full pressure due to water
current upto full scour. This may result in tilting, sliding and shifting. As a part of the safety
during construction,
this should be considered and
safety of well must be ensured by
suitable methods, where required.
708.5
Tilts and Shifts
708.5.1
As far as possible, the wells shall be sunk plumb without any
tilts and shifts.
However, a tilt of 1
in 80 and a shift of 1 50 mm due to translation (both additive) in a direction
which will cause most severe effect shall be considered
in the design of well foundations.
27



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
708.5.2
If the actual tiits and shifts exceed the above limits, then the remedial measures
have to be resorted to bring the weli within that limit.
If it is not possible then its effect on bearing
pressure, steining stress and other structural elements shall be examined, and controlled
if
necessary and feasible, by resorting to change in span length. The Engineer-in-charge may
like to specify the maximum tilts and shifts upto which the well may be accepted subject to the
bearing pressure and steining stress being within limits, by changing the span length
if needed,
and beyond which the weli will be rejected irrespective of the result of any modification.
708.6
Cutting Edge
708.6.1
The mild steel cutting edge shall be strong enough and not less than 40 kg/m to
facilitate sinking of the well through the types of strata expected to be encountered without
suffering any damage.
It shall be properly anchored to the well curb. For sinking through
rock, cutting edge should be suitably designed.
708.6.2
When there are two or more compartments
in a well, the lover end of the
cutting edge of the middle stems of such wells
shall be kept about 300 mm above that
of the outer stems to prevent rocking, as shown in the Appendix-3 (Fig. 2).
708J
Well Curb
708.7.1
The well curb should be such that
it will offer the minimum resistance while the
well
is being sunk but should be strong enough to be able to transmit superimposed loads
from the steining to the bottom plug.
708.7.2
The shape and the outline dimension of the curb as given in Appendix-3 (Fig,
2) may be taken for guidance. The internal angle of the curb 'as' as shown in Appendix-3
(Fig. 2) should be kept at about 30° to 37° and may be increased or decreased based on
past experience and geotechnica! data.
708.7.3
The
well curb
shall
invariably be
in
reinforced concrete
of mix not leaner
than M 25 with minimum reinforcement of 72 kg/cum excluding bond
rods. The
steel
shall be suitably arranged
to prevent spreading and
splitting
of the curb during sinking
and in service.
708.7.4
In case
blasting
is
anticipated,
the
inner faces
of the
well
curb
shall be
protected
with
steel
plates
of thickness
not
less than
10 mm
upto the top
of the
well
curb.
If
it
is desired
to increase the steel
lining above the well curb then the thickness
can be reduced to 6 mm for that increased
height.
In any case,
this extra height of the
steel
should
not be more than
3
metres
unless
there
is
a
specific
requirement. The
curb
in such
a case should be provided
with
additional hoop reinforcement
of 10 mm
dia
mild
steel
or deformed
bars
at
150 mm
centres
which
shall
also
extend
upto
a
height of 3 m
into the well steining above the curb. Additional reinforcement above
this
28



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 110
======================================================================
iRC:78-2014
height
upto two times
the thickness
of steining
should
be
provided
to
avoid
cracking
arising out of sudden change in the effective section due to curtailment of plate.
708.8
Bottom Plug
708.8.1
The bottom plug shall be provided
in
al! wells and the top shall be kept not
lower than 300 mm
in the centre above the top of the curb as shown
in the Appendix-3
(Fig. 2). A suitable sump shall be below the level of the cutting edge. Before concerting the
bottom plug,
it shall be ensured that its inside faces have been cleaned thoroughly.
708.8.2
The concrete mix used
in bottom plug shall have a minimum cement content
of 330 kg/m 3 and a slump of about
1 50 mm to permit easy flow of concrete through termie to
place fill-up all cavities. Concrete shall be laid in one continuous operation
till dredge hole is
filled to required height. For under water concreting, the concrete shall be placed by tremie
under still water condition and the cement content of mix be increased by 10 percent.
708.8.3
in case grouted colcrete,
e.g., concrete
is used, the grout mix shall not be
leaner than 1:2 and
it shall be ensured by suitable means, such as, controlling the rate of
pumping that the grout filis-up ail interstices upto the top of the plug.
708. 8.4
if any dewatering
is required
it shall be carried out after 7 days have elapsed
after bottom plugging.
708.9
Filling the Well
708.9.1 The filling of the well,
if considered necessary, above the bottom plug shall be done
with sand or excavated material free from organic matter.
708.10
Plug over Filling
708.10.1
A 300 mm thick plug of M 15 cement concrete shall be provided over the filling.
708.11
Weil Cap
708.11.1
The bottom of well cap shall be laid as low as possible but above the LWL in
the active channel. Where the bed level
is higher than LWL the bottom of well cap may be
suitably raised.
708.11.2
As many longitudinal bars as possible coming from the well steining shall be
anchored into the well cap.
708.11.3
The design of the well cap shall be based on; any accepted rational method,
considering the worst combination of loads and forces as per Clause 706.

IRC:78-2014
708.12
Floating Caissons
708.12.1
Floating caissons may be of steel, reinforced concrete or any suitable material.
They should have at least 1.5 metres free board above the water level and increased,
if
considered necessary,
in case there
is a possibility of caissons sinking suddenly owing to
reasons, such as, scour likely to result from lowering of caissons, effect of waves, sinking
in very soft strata, etc.
708.12.2
Well
caissons
should
be
checked
for
stability
against
overturning
and
capsizing while being towed, and during sinking, due to the action of water current, wave
pressure, wind, etc.
708.12.3
The floating caisson
shall
not be considered as
part of foundation unless
proper shear transfer at the interface is ensured.
708.13
Sinking of Weils
708.13.1
The well shall as far as possible be sunk true and vertical. Sinking should
not be started
till the steining has been cured for at least 48 hours. A complete record
of sinking operating including
tilt and shifts, kentledge, dewatering, blasting, etc. done
during sinking shall be maintained.
For safe sinking of wells, necessary guidance may be taken from the precautions as given
in Appendix-4,
708.14
Pneumatic Sinking of Wells
708.14.1
Where sub-surface data indicate the need for pneumatic sinking,
it
will be
necessary to decide the method and location of pneumatic equipment and
its supporting
adapter.
708.14.2
In case
if concrete
steining
is
provided,
it
shall be
rendered
air
tight by
restricting the tension
in concrete which
will not exceed 3/8
th of the modulus of rupture.
For the circular wells, the tension in steining may be evaluated by assuming
it to be a thick
walled cylinder.
708.14.3
The steining shall be checked at different sections for any possible rupture
against the uplift force and,
if necessary, shall be adequately strengthened.
708.14.4
The design requirements of the pneumatic equipment, safety of personnel
and the structure shall comply with the provisions of IS 4138 "Safety Code for Working
in Compressed Air".
It
is desirable that the height of the working chamber in a pneumatic
caissons should not be less than 3 metres to provide sufficient head room when the cutting

is embedded a short distance below the excavated
level and
in particular to allow
for blowing down. The limiting depth for pneumatic sinking should be such that the depth
of water below normal water level to the proposed foundation level upto which pneumatic
sinking
is proposed should not exceed 30
.
708.1 5
Sinking of Wells by Resorting to Blasting
Blasting may be employed with prior approval of competent authority to help sinking of well
for breaking obstacles, such as, boulders or for levelling the rock layer for square seating of
wells. Blasting may be resorted to only when other methods are found ineffective.
709 PILE FOUNDATION
709.1
General
709.1.1
Piles transmit the load of a structure to competent sub-surface strata by the
resistance developed from bearing at the toe or skin friction along the surface or both. The
piles may be required to carry uplift and lateral loads besides direct vertical load.
709.1.2
The construction of pile foundation requires a careful choice of piling system
depending upon subsoil conditions and load characteristics of structures. The permissible
limits of total and differential settlement, unsupported length of pile under scour and any
other special requirements of project are also equally important criteria for adoption.
709.1.3
Design and construction
: For design and construction of piles guidance may
be taken from
IS 2911
subject to limitations/stipulations given
in this code. Appendix-5
gives the design formulae and their applicability.
709.1.4
For
piles
in
streams,
rivers,
creeks,
etc.,
the
following
criteria may be
followed:
i)
Scour conditions are properly established.
ii)
Permanent
steel
liner should be provided
at
least upto maximum scour
level.
In case of marine clay or soft soil or soil having aggressive material,
permanent steel liner of sufficient strength shall be used for the full depth of
such strata. The minimum thickness of liner should be 6 mm
For bridges located
in land, steel liners of minimum thickness of 6 mm shall
be provided in cases given below. The liner shall be provided up to depth up
to which following situations prevail.
a)
While constructing the pile foundation through very soft clay (N < 3) ,very loose
sandy strata (N < 8), bouldery formation and artesian conditions, wherein the
31

wails of boreholes cannot be stabilized by bentoniie circulation.
b)
Where sewage
leakage
is common phenomenon as
well as
sites
with
aggressive soil/water environment
709.1 .5
Spacing of piles and tolerances
Spacing of piles
Where pier is supported on multiple piles, connected by frame structure or by
solid pile cap, the spacing of piles should be considered in relation to the nature
of the ground, their behavior in groups and the execution convenience. The
spacing should be chosen with regard to the resulting heave or compaction and
should be wide enough to enable the desired number of piles to be installed
to the correct penetration without damage to any adjacent construction or to
the piles themselves.
For land bridges, pier may be supported on single pile having diameter sufficiently
large to accommodate construction tolerances of pile installation with reference
to location of piers as weil as having strength as required by the design. The
pile should be designed to cater for the maximum eccentricity of vertical ioad
in such case. Alternatively, pile shaft can be continued to act as a pier and get
connected to pier cap which is designed to accommodate the eccentricities due
to construction tolerances.
The size of a cap carrying the load from the structure to the
pile heads, or the size and
effective length of a ground beam, may influence type, size and spacing of piles.
The spacing of piles will be determined by many aspects mentioned above. The working
rules which are generally, though not always, suitable, are as follows:
For friction piies, the spacing centre should not be less than the perimeter of the pile or
for circular pile, three times the diameter. The spacing of piles deriving their resistance
mainly from end bearing may be reduced but the distance between the surfaces of the
shafts of adjacent piies should be not less than the least width of the piles.
709. 1.5.2
Permissible tolerances for piles shall he as under:
i)
For vertical piles 75 mm at piling platform level and
tilt not exceeding
1
in
150;
ii)
For raker piles tolerance of
1
in 25.
709.1.6
The maximum rake to be permitted in piie shall not exceed the following:
i)
1
in 6 for all bored piles;
ii)
1
in 6 for driven cast-in-situ piies; and
32

IRC:78-2014
709.1.7
The minimum diameter shall be 1.0 m for river/marine bridges. For bridges
beyond the water zone and for bridges on land, the diameter may be reduced upto 750 mm.
709.1 .8
Settlement, differential settlement and pile capacity
The
Differential settlement between two successive foundations taken at
pile cap
level,
may be estimated from the maximum settlement expected at two foundations for the dead
load, superimposed loads,
live load and scour effect. The increase
in settlement with time
in clayey soils shall be accounted for.
In absence of detailed calculations, for the purpose
of preliminary design,
it can be taken as not more than the maximum settlement of any of
the two foundations.
The
differential settlement shall be
limited depending upon the following functional and
structural considerations:
a)
Functionally, acceptable
differential settlement between two neighboring
piers shall not be greater than
1
in 400 of the span to ensure riding comfort,
as specified
in Clause 706.3.2.1.
b) The allowable settlement of a single pile considered for estimating the pile
capacity shall be arrived from correlation of the settlement of pile group to
that of single pile, as per Clause 709.3.4.
c)
It
is further provided that the working load capacity of pile based on the
sub-clause b) shall not exceed 40 percent of the load corresponding to
the settlement of 10 percent of pile diameter (i.e. safety factor of 2.5 on
ultimate load capacity is ensured).
709.1 .9
For both Precast and cast-in-situ piles, the values regarding grade of concrete,
water cement ratio, slump shall be as follows:

admixtures
(flyash,
silica fume, GGBS conforming
to
respective
B!S/lnternational
standards) and as per IRC:112 is recommended.
ii)
In marine conditions and areas exposed to action of harmful chemicals, protection
of pile caps with suitable coating such as bituminous based, coal-tar epoxy based
coating may be considered. High alumina cements,
(i.e. quick setting cement) shall
not be used in marine conditions. Also when both chlorides and sulphates are present,
use of sulphate-resistant cement is not recommended.
709.2
Requirement and Steps for Design and Installation
709.2.1
The
initial design of an individual
pile, confirmation of
its capacity by either
initial load test or by re-confirmation of actual
soil parameters, modification of design,
if
required, and final adoption should pass through following steps of investigations, design
and load testing:
i)
Comprehensive
and
detailed
sub-surface
investigation
for
piles
to
determine the design parameters of end bearing capacity, friction capacity
and lateral capacity of soil surrounding the pile.
ii)
Design of pile and
pile group based on
i) above
for specified bearing
strata.
iii)
Initial load testing:
Initial load test on pile of same diameter as design pile for direct confirmation
of design.
The initial load test is a part of the design process confirming the expected
properties of bearing strata and the pile capacity.
iv)
Steps
ii) and
iii) should be repeated for different types of strata met at site.
709.2.2
The steps for design and confirmation by tests are given below:
i)
Sub-soil exploration to reconfirm soil parameters assumed in the design.
ii)
Provide for the required design capacity of pile group based on tentative
number and diameter of piles in a group.
iii)
The allowable total/differential settlement of single pile should be based on
the considerations as per Clauses 709.1 .8 and 709.3.4. Capacity of single
pile
is to be based on static formula considering ground characteristics.
This step along with step
ii) may be iterative.
iv)
Structural design of piles.
v)
Initial load test as mentioned in Clause 709.2.1
iii)
is for axial load capacity,
34



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
including
uplift capacity,
if required, on
trial piles of the same diameter as
the design pile. The testing shall be done as per the procedure laid down in
IS:2911,
Part-IV. This load test shall be conducted for not less than 272
times the design load. The
initial load test shall be cyclic load test for piles
deriving strength from end bearing and side friction. The maintained load
test can be performed for end bearing piles without relying on friction, and
for the socketed piles in rock.
vi)
If the
initial load test gives a capacity greater than 25 percent of the capacity
calculated by static formula, and
if
it
is desired to take benefit of the higher
capacity, another two load tests shall be carried out to confirm the earlier
value and minimum of the three shall be considered as initial load test value.
The number of initial tests shall be determined by the Engineer-in-charge
taking into consideration the bore log and soil profile.
709.2.3
For abutment,
it
is important to consider overall
stability of the structure
and
abutment. The
piles
should
also
be
designed
to
sustain
surcharge
effect
of
embankment.
709.2.4
Routine load test
i)
Routine load test should be done at locations of alternate foundations of
bridges to reconfirm or modify the allowable loads. Vertical and horizontal
load tests should be properly designed to cover particular pile group. The
lateral load test may be conducted on two adjacent piles. However, results
of routine load tests shall not be used for upward revision of design capacity
of piles. The minimum number of tests to be conducted is as given below for
confirming pile capacity.
Total number of Piles for the Bridge Minimum No. of Test Piles

NOTE:
The number of tests may be judiciously increased depending upon the variability of
foundations strata.
ii)
Permissible Over Load
While conducting routine test on one of the pile belonging to a pile group, if
35



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
the pile
is found to be deficient (based on the settlement criteria at 1.5
times the design load) an overload upto 1 0 percent of the reduced capacity
may be allowed.
iii)
For a quick assessment of piie capacity, high-strain dynamic tests may be
conducted after establishing co-relations using the results of load tests.
However, results of the strain dynamic tests shall not be used for upward
revision of design capacity of pile. Detailed guidelines are at Appendix-7
Part 1. These methods can be followed.
iv)
To have a fairly good idea about the quality of concrete and construction
defects
like
voids,
discontinuities,
etc.,
pile
integrity
tests
are
extensively
conducted.

capacity
of
pile
for
load
combination
I
of Clause
706.1.1,
recommendation of Appendix-5 should be followed. For calculating capacity of pile group,
refer Clauses 709.3.3 and 709.3.4 and the allowable settlement criteria as per Clause 709.1 .8.
For purpose of these Clauses the following definitions will apply.
a)

709.3.2
Factor of Safety
The minimum factor of safety on ultimate axial capacity computed on the basis of
static formula shall be 2.5 for load combination
I of Clause 706.1 .1 for piles in soil. For
piles
in rock, factor of safety shall be 3 on end bearing component and 6 on socket
side resistance component, for load combination
I of clause 706.1.1 subject to further
limits as stipulated in Appendix-5.

IRC:78-2014
709.3.3
Capacity of piles/group action
The axial capacity of a group of piles should be determined by a factor to be applied to
the capacity of individual piles multiplied by the number of piles of the group.
i)
Factor may be taken as
1
in case of purely end bearing piles having minimum
spacing of 2.0 times the diameter of pile and for frictional piles having spacing
of minimum 3 times diameter of pile.
ii)
For pile groups in clays, the group capacity shall be lesser of the following:
a) Sum of the capacities of the individual piles in the group.
b) The capacity of the group based on block failure concept, where the ultimate
load carrying capacity of the block enclosing the piles in estimated.
709. 3.4
Settlement of pile group
709.3.4. 1
The capacity of a pile group is aiso governed by settlement criterion. Settlement
of a pile group may be computed on the basis of following recommendations or by any other
rational method.
709. 3. 4. 2
Settlement of pile group in sands
The settlement of a pile group is affected by the shape and size of group, length, spacing and
method of installation of piles. Methods given in IS 8009 (Part-ll) of any other rational method
may be used. The settlement of group of piles in sands can be calculated by assuming that
the load carried by the pile group is transferred to the soil through an equivalent raft located
at one third of the pile length upwards from the pile toe for friction piles. For end bearing piles
the settlement can be calculated by assuming the raft placed at the toe of the pile group.
709. 3. 4. 3
Settlement of pile group in clays
The settlement of pile group
in homogeneous clays shall be evaluated using Terzaghi and
Peck Approach which assumes that the load carried by the pile group
is transferred to the
soil through an equivalent footing located at one third of the pile length upwards from the
pile toe. The load under the equivalent footing
is assumed to spread into soil at a slope of
2 (vertical)
:
1 (horizontal).
The settlement
for equivalent footing
shall be evaluated
in accordance with
IS 8009
(Part-ll).

Settlement of piles founded
in rock may be computed as per IS 8009 (Part
II) considering the
value of in-situ modulus of rock mass.
709.3.5
Resistance to lateral loads
709.3.5. 1
The ultimate lateral resistance of a group of vertical piles may be taken as the
passive pressure acting on the enclosed area of the piles. Such passive pressure may be
calculated over an equivalent wall of depth equal to 6D and width equal to L + 2B.
Diameter of pile
Length between outer faces of pile group
in plan perpendicular to
direction of movement.
Width between outer faces of pile group in plan parallel to the direction
of movement.
of safety on ultimate lateral resistance shali be 2.5.
709.3.5.2
The safe
lateral resistance of pile-group must not exceed the sum of lateral
resistance of individual piles. The safe lateral load resistance of individual pile depends on the
modulus of horizontal sub-grade reaction of the foundation material as well as the structural
rigidity of pile. Appropriate rational method of analysis using soil modulus as recommended
by IS:2911 may be used
to calculate the same. For safe
lateral load resistance
in load
combination
I of Clause 706.1.1, the deflection at scour level shall not be greater than 1.0
percent of pile diameter. Checking of deflections in other load combinations is not required.
For a group of vertical piles, confirmation of capacity of group by load testing is not required.
For single pile the horizontal load test may be performed in accordance with IS:291 1
. Testing
shall be for free head condition for piles having free standing shaft above scour level upto the
pile cap. For conduction test at scour level,
it will be necessary to drive a larger diameter
casing upto scour level so that the test pile above
is free to deflect. The deflection at scour
level may be measured directly, or may be calculated from deflection measured at higher
(ground)
level assuming that the
pile acts as structural cantilever from the point of
fixity.
The point of fixity can be taken from the analysis performed for the design or calculated by
simplified method given in IS:2911.
709.3.6
Uplift load carrying capacity
709.3.6. 1 Piles may be required to resist uplift forces of permanent or temporary nature when
used in foundations subjected to large overturning moments or as anchorages in structures,
like, underpasses subjected to hydrostatic uplift pressure.

======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
709.3.6.2
The ultimate
uplift capacity may be calculated with the expression of shaft
resistance/skin friction only, of the static formulae for compression loads and applying a
reduction factor of 0.70 on the same.
In case of rock, the socket length shall be measured
from 0.3 m depth to actual depth of socket. The weight of the
pile shall also be taken
as acting against uplift. Pull out test shall be conducted for verification of uplift capacity.
Factor of (2.5/0.7) = 3.5 on the ultimate strength shall be used.
709.3.6.3
The uplift capacity of pile group is lesser of the two following values:
-
the sum of the uplift resistance of the individual piles in the group, and
-
the sum of shear resistance mobilised on the surface perimeter of the
group plus the effective weight of the soil and the piles enclosed
in this
surface perimeter.
709.3.6.4
Piles should be checked for structural adequacy against uplift forces together
with other co-existent forces,
if any.
709.3.6.5
The minimum factor of safety on ultimate uplift load calculated on the aforesaid
basis shall be 2.5.
709.3.7
Piles subjected to downward drag
When a soil stratum through which pile shaft has penetrated into an underlying hard stratum
compresses due to
its own weight, or remoulding, or surface load etc., additional vertical
load
is generated along the pile shaft in such stratum. Such additional load coming on pile
may be assessed on the following basis:
i)
In the case
of
pile deriving
its capacity mainly from
friction, the value
of downward drag
force may be taken as 0.2
to 0.3 times undrained
shear strength multiplied by the surface area of pile shaft embedded
in
compressible soil.
ii)
In case of pile deriving
its capacity mainly from end bearing, the value
of downward
drag
force may be
considered as
0.5
times
undrained
shear strength multiplied by the surface area of pile shaft embedded
in
compressible soil.
iii)
For a group of piles, the drag forces shall also be calculated considering
the surface area of the block
(i.e., perimeter of the group times depth)
embedded
in compressible
soil.
In the event of this value being higher
than the number of piles in the group times the individual downward drag
forces, the same shall be cosidered in the design.
iv)
This reduction in capacity of pile is in the ultimate capacity

IRC:78-2014
709.4
Structural Design of Piles
709.4.1
A pile as a structural member shall have sufficient strength to transmit the load
from structure to soil. The pile shall also be designed to withstand temporary stresses,
if any,
to which
it may be subjected to, such as, handling and driving stresses. The permissible
stresses should be as per IRC:112.
The test pile shall be separately designed to carry test load safely to the foundation.
709.4.2
The piles may be designed taking
into consideration
all the load effects and
their structural capacity examined as a column. The self load of pile or lateral load due to
earthquake, water current force, etc. on the portion of free pile upto scour level and upto
potential liquefaction level,
if applicable, should be duly accounted for.
709.4.3
For the horizontal loads the moments in pile shaft can be calculated as described
in Clause 709.3.5.2. For piles on land,
if the pile group is provided with rigid cap, then the piles
may be considered as having fixed head
in appropriate direction for this purpose. Horizontal
force may be distributed equally in all piles in a group with a rigid pile cap.
709.4.4
Reinforcements for cast-in-situ piles
The reinforcements in pile should be provided complying with the requirements of IRC:112,
as per the design requirements. The area of longitudinal reinforcement shall not be less
than 0.4 percent nor greater than 2.5 percent of the actual area of cross-section in all cast-
in-situ concrete piles. The clear spacing between vertical bars shall not be less than 100
mm. Grouping of not more than two bars together can be made for achieving the same.
Lateral reinforcement shall be provided
in the form of spirals with minimum 8 mm diameter
steel, spacing not more than 150 mm. For inner layer of reinforcement, separate links tying
them to each other and to outer layers shall be provided.
709.4.5
For pre-cast driven piles, the reinforcement should comply with the provision
of IRC: 11 2, for resisting stresses due to lifting, stacking and transport, any uplift or bending
transmitted from the superstructure and bending due to any secondary effects. The area of
longitudinal reinforcement shall not be less than the following percentages of the cross-
sectional area of the piles:
a)
For piles with a length less than 30 times the least width
-
1 .25 percent;
b)
For piles with a length 30 to 40 times the least width
-
1 .5 percent; and
c)
For piles with a length greater than 40 times the least width -2 percent.
709.5
Design of Pile Cap

IRC:78-2014
consideration the allowable tolerance as in Clause 709.1.5.2. A minimum offset of 150 mm
shall be provided beyond the outer faces of the outer-most piles
in the group.
If the
pile
cap is in contact with earth at the bottom, a levelling course of minimum 80 mm thick plain
cement concrete shall be provided.
709.5.2
The top of the pile shall project 50 mm into the pile cap and reinforcements of
pile shall be fully anchored in pile cap.
709.5.3
In Marine conditions or in areas exposed to the action of harmful chemicals,
the pile cap shall be protected with a suitable anti-corrosive paint. High alumina cement i.e.
quick setting cement shall not be used in marine constructions.
709.5.4
The minimum thickness of pile cap should be 1.5 times the diameter of pile.
Such a pile cap can be considered as rigid. The pile cap may be designed as thick slab or,
by using 'strut & tie' method. All reinforcement in pile cap shall have full anchorage capacity
beyond the point at which
it
is no longer required.
It should be specially ascertained for
pile cap designed by
'strut &
tie' method. Where large diameter bars are used as main
reinforcement, the corners of pile caps have large local cover due to large radius of bending
of main bars. Such corners shall be protected by locally placing small diameter bars.
709.5.5
Casting
of
pile cap
should
be
at
level
higher than
water
level
unless
functionally
it
is required to be below water level at which time sufficient precautions
should be taken to dewater, the forms to allow concreting
I dry conditions.
709.6
Important Consideration, Inspection/Precautions for Different Types
of Piles
709.6.1
Driven cast-in-situ piles
709.6.1.1
Except otherwise stated in this code, guidance is to be obtained from IS 2911
(Part 1/Section
I).
709.6.1.2
The pile shoes which may be either of cast iron conical type or of mild steel flat
type should have double reams for proper seating of the removable casing tube inside the
space between the reams.
709.6. 1.3
Before commencement of pouring of concrete,
it should be ensured that there
is no ingress of water in the casing tube from the bottom. Further adequate control during
withdrawal of the casing tube
is essential so as to maintain
sufficient head of concrete
inside the casing tube at all stages of withdrawal.

709.6.7.4
Concrete
in piles shall be cast upto a minimum height of 600 mm above the
designed top level of pile, which shall be stripped off to obtain sound concrete either before
final set or after 3 days.
709.6.2
Bored cast-in-situ piles
709.6.2. 1
The drilling mud, such as, bentonite suspension shall be maintained at a level
sufficiently above the surrounding ground water level to ensure the
stability of the strata
which
is being penetrated throughout the boring process until the pile has been concreted.
709.6.2.2
The bores must be washed by fresh bentonite solution flushing to ensure
clean bottom at two stages prior to concreting and after placing reinforcement.
709. 6. 2. 3
Concreting of piles
Concreting shall be done by tremie method. In tremie method the following requirements are
particularly applicable.
a)
When concreting
is carried out for a
pile, a temporary casing should
be
installed
to
sufficient depth,
so
that fragments
of ground cannot
drop from the sides of the hole
into the concrete as
it
is placed. The
temporary casing
is not required except near the top when concreting
under drilling mud.
b)
The hopper and tremie should be a leak proof system.
c)
Tremie diameter of minimum 200 mm shall be used with 20 mm diameter
down aggregate.
d)
The first charge of concrete should be placed with a sliding plug pushed
down the tube ahead of it or with a steel plate of adequate charge to prevent
mixing of concrete and water. However, the plug should not be
left in the
concrete as a lump.
e)
The tremie pipe should always penetrate well
into the concrete with an
adequate margin of safety against accidental withdrawal of the pipe. The
tremie should be always full of concrete.
f)
The pile should be concreted wholly by tremie and the method of deposition
should not be changed part way up the pile, to prevent the laitance from
being entrapped within the pile.
g)
All tremie tubes should be scrupulously cleaned after use.

IRC:78-2014
h)
As tremie method of concreting is not under water concreting, these is no
need to add 10 percent extra cement.
i)
Normally concreting of the piles should be uninterrupted. In the exceptional
case of interruption of concreting; but which can be resumed within
1 or
2 hours, the tremie shall not be taken out of the concrete. Instead
it shall
be raised and lowered slowly, from time to time to prevent the concrete
form setting. Concreting should be resumed by introducing a
little richer
concrete with a slump of about 200 mm for easy displacement of the
partly set concrete.
If the concreting cannot be resumed before final set of concrete already
placed, the pile so cast may be rejected or accepted with modifications.
j)
In case of withdrawal of tremie out of the concrete, either accidentally or
to remove a choke
in the tremie, the tremie may be reintroduced
in the
following manner to prevent impregnation of laitance or scum lying on the
top of the concrete already deposited in the bore.
k)
The tremie
shall be
gently lowered on
to the
old concrete
with very
little penetration
initially. A vermiculite plug/surface retarders should be
introduced in the tremie. Fresh concrete of slump between 150 mm to 175
mm should be filled in the tremie which will push the plug forward and will
emerge out of the tremie displacing the laitance/scum. The tremie will be
pushed further in steps making fresh concrete sweep away laitance/scum
in
its way. When tremie
is buried by about 60 to 100 cm, concreting may
be resumed.
I)
The 'L' bends in the reinforcements at the bottom of the piles should not be
provided to avoid the formation of soft toe.
709. 6. 2. 4
Removal of concrete above cut-off level
It
is desirable that the concrete above cut-off level
is removed before the concrete
is set.
The concrete may be removed manually or by specially made bailer or other device. Such
removal of concrete helps in preventing the damages of the good concrete below the cut-off
level which results from chipping by percussion method.
The removal of concrete can be within ± 25 mm from the specified cut-off level preferably
on the
(-) side. On removal of the such concrete, the concrete should be compacted with
rammer with spikes or
it shall be vibrated.
In case the concrete
is not removed before
setting, a groove
shall be made on outer
perimeter by rotary equipment before chipping by percussion method.

709.6.3.2
This type of piles for bridges may be adopted when length of pile as per
design requirement
is known with reasonable degree of accuracy. Extra length of pile
may be cast to avoid lengthening of piles as far as possible. When unavoidable, the
splicing for lengthening of steel may be used only after the method of splicing
is tested
and approved earlier.
The longitudinal reinforcement shall be joined by welding or by mechanical couplers. The
concrete at top of original pile shall be cut down to sufficient length to avoid spelling by heat
of welding. Location of mechanical couplers in neighboring reinforcement shall be such as

710.10.1
The pedestals should be so proportioned that a clear offset of 1 50 mm beyond
the edges of bearings is available.
710.10.2
The height of the pedestal should be between 150 mm and 500 mm. Where
the depths
of superstructures from two adjacent spans on a common
pier

GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING SILT FACTOR FOR BED
MATERIAL CONSISTING OF CLAY
In absence of any formula 'KJ may be determined as per Clause 703.2.2 and may be
adopted based on
site information and behaviour history of any existing structure. The
clayey bed having weighted diameter normally less than 0.04mm offers more resistance
scour than sand though mean depth of scour as per the formula given
in Clause 703.2
indicates more scour.
In absence of any accepted rational formula or any data of scour at
the site of the proposed bridge; the following theoretical calculation may be adopted:

Appendix-2
(Clause 704.3)
GUIDELINES FOR SUB-SURFACE EXPLORATION
1 GENERAL
The objective of sub-surface exploration
is to determine the suitability of the soil or rock,
for the foundation of bridges. The sub-surface exploration for bridges
is carried out in two
stages, namely preliminary and detailed.
It may require additional/confirmatory exploration
during construction stage.
Guidance may be taken from the following:
i)
IS 1892
- Code of Practice for Site Investigation for Foundations may be
utilised for guidance regarding investigation and collection of data.
ii)
Test on
soils shall be conducted
in accordance with relevant part of IS
2720
- Methods of Test for Soils. The tests on undisturbed samples be
conducted as far as possible at simulated field conditions to get realistic
values.
iii)
IS 1498-Classification and Identification of Soils for general engineering
purposes.
For preliminary and detailed sub-surface investigation, only rotary drills shall be used. The
casing shall also be, invariably provided with diameters not less than 150 mm upto the level of
rock,
if any. However, use of percussion or wash boring equipment shall be permitted only to
penetrate through bouldery or gravelly strata for progressing the boring but not for collection
of samples. While conducting detailed borings, the resistance to the speed of drilling,
i.e.,
rate of penetration, core loss, etc. shall be carefully recorded and presented in "Borelog chart
and data sheet" to evaluate the different types of strata and distinguish specially sand from
sandstone, clay from shale, etc.
For preliminary and detailed sub-surface investigation, only double tube diamond
drilling
method shall be used. In soft and weak rocks such tuffs, soft shales etc., triple tube diamond
drilling shall be used.
2 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
2.1
Preliminary
investigation
shall
include
the
study
of
existing
geological
information,
previous
site
reports,
geological
maps,
etc.,
and
surface
geological

IRC:78-2014
examination. These
will
help
to narrow down the number of sites under consideration
and also to locate the most desirable location for detailed sub-surface investigation.
3 DETAILED INVESTIGATION
3=1
Based on
data
obtained
after
preliminary
investigations,
the
bridge
site,
the type of structure with span arrangement and the location and type of foundations,
the programme of detailed
investigations,
etc.
shall be tentatively decided. Thereafter
the scope of detailed
investigation
including the extent of exploration, number of bore
holes, type of tests, number of tests, etc. shall be decided
in close liaison with the design
engineer and
the
exploration team,
so
that adequate data considered necessary
for
detailed design and execution are obtained.
3.2
The exploration shall cover the entire length of the bridge and also at either
end
a
distance
of zone
of
influence,
i.e.,
about
twice
the
depth
below
bed
of
the
last main
foundation
to assess
the
effect
of the approach embankment on
the end
foundations.
Generally,
the sub-surface
investigations should extend
to a depth below
the
anticipated foundation
level equal
to about one and
a
half times the width
of the
foundation. However, where such
investigations end
in any unsuitable or questionable
foundation
material,
the
exploration
shall be extended
to
a
sufficient depth
into
firm
and stable soils or to rock.
3.2.1
Additional drill holes: Where the data made available by detailed exploration
indicate appreciable variation specially
in case of foundations resting on rock,
it will be
necessary to resort to additional
drill holes to establish a complete profile of the underlying
strata. Location and depth of additional
drill holes will have to be decided depending upon
the extent of variation in local geology and in consultation with design engineer.
3.3
The scope of the detailed sub-surface exploration shall be fixed as mentioned
in para 3.1 and 3.2. However, as a general guide
it shall be comprehensive enough to
enable the designer to estimate or determine the following:
i)
engineering properties of the soil/rock;
ii)
location and extent of weak layers and cavities,
if any, below hard founding
strata;
iii)
the sub-surface geological condition, such as, type of rock, structure of
rock,
i.e.,
folds,
faults,
fissures, shears,
fractures,
joints, dykes and
subsidence due to mining or presence of cavities;
55



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
iv)
ground water level;
v)
artesian conditions,
if any;
vi)
quality of water in contact with the foundation;
vii)
depth and extent of scour;
viii)
suitable foundation level;
ix)
safe bearing capacity of foundation stratum;
x)
probable settlement and probable differential settlement of the foundations;
xi)
likely sinking or driving effort; and
xii)
likely construction difficulties.
4 CONSTRUCTION STAGE EXPLORATION
Such exploration may become necessary to verify the actually met strata vis-a-vis detailed
investigation stage or when a change
in the sub-soil strata/rock
profile
is encountered
during construction.
In such situations,
it may be essential to resort to further explorations
to establish the correct data, for further decisions.
5 METHOD OF TAKING SOIL SAMPLES
The size of the bores shall be predetermined so that undisturbed samples as required for the
various types of tests are obtained. The method of taking samples shall be as given in IS1892
and IS 2132. The tests on soil samples shall be conducted as per relevant part of IS 2720.
6 DETAILS OF EXPLORATION FOR FOUNDATIONS
RESTING ON SOIL (ERODIBLE STRATA)
6.1
The
type
and
extent
of
exploration
shall
be
divided
into
the
following
groups
keeping
in view the
different requirements
of foundation
design and
the
likely
method of data collection:
i)
Foundations requiring shallow depth of exploration;
ii)
Foundations requiring large depth of exploration; and
iii)
Fills behind abutments and protective works.
6.2
Foundations Requiring Shallow Depth of Exploration (Open Foundation)
These shall cover cases where the depth of exploration
is not large and
it is possible to take
samples from shallow pits or conduct direct tests,
like, plate load tests, etc. This will also
cover generally the foundation soil for approach embankments, protective works, etc.
56



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
6.2.1
The primary requirements are
stability and
settlement,
for which shearing
strength characteristics, load settlement characteristics, etc. need determination.
6.2.2
Tests
shall
be
conducted
on
undisturbed
representative
samples,
which
may be obtained from open
pits. The use of plate load
test
(IS
1 888-Method
of Load
Test on
Soils)
is considered
desirable
for ascertaining the safe
bearing
pressure and
settlement
characteristics. A few
exploratory
bore
holes
or soundings
shall
be made
to safeguard against presence of weak strata underlying the foundation. This shall extend
to a depth of about
1 V2 times the proposed width of foundation.
NOTE:
For better interpretation,
it will be desirable to correlate the laboratory results with the
in-situ tests,
like, plate load tests, penetration test results.
6.2.3
The tests to be conducted for properties of soil are different for cohesive and
cohesionless soils. These are indicated below. While selecting the tests and interpreting
the results, limitations of applicability of chosen tests shall be taken into account. A most
suitable and appropriate combination of these shall be chosen, depending on the properties
needed for design and constructional aspects.
I)
Cohesionless Soil
a)
Laboratory Tests
i)
Classification tests, index tests, density determination, etc.
ii) Shear Strengths by triaxial/direct shear,
.etc.

tests
may
be
conducted
(as per IS 2720 Part XVII).

S 3
Foundations Requiring Large Depth of Exploration
6.3.1
In this group are covered cases of deep wells, pile foundations, etc., where the use of
boring equipment, special techniques of sampling, in-situ testing, etc. become essential. In
addition to the problems of soil and foundation interaction an important consideration can be
the soil data required from construction considerations. Often in the case of cohesionless
soils, undisturbed samples cannot be taken and recourse has to be made to in-situ
field tests.
Boring and sampling tends to cause remoulding of sensitive clays. Also for fissured
or layered clays, the sample may not truly represent the
in-situ properties, due to
disturbance and stress changes caused by boring and sampling activity. In such cases,
in-situ tests shall be performed.
6.3.2
The sub-surface exploration can be divided into three zones:
i)
between
bed
level and
upto
anticipated maximum
scour depth
(below
H.F.L.)
ii)
from the maximum scour depth to the foundation level, and
iii)
from foundation level to about 1V2 times the width of foundation below
it.
6.3.3
Sampling and
testing
(in-situ and
laboratory) requirement
will vary
in each
case and hence are required to be assessed and decided from case-to-case. The sub-
soil water shall be tested for chemical properties to evaluate the hazard of deterioration
to foundations. Where dewatering
is expected to be required, permeability characteristics
should be determined.
6.3.4
For the different zones categorised in para 6.3.2., the data required, method of
sampling, testing, etc. are given in Table 1. Samples of soils in all cases shall be collected
at every
1 to
1 V2 metre or at change of strata.

5)
Down hole/Cross hole seismic surveys are useful for long bridges (i.e. of the order of
1 km and above) and for reducing the number
of bores taken
in the portions that are permanently under water. For these applications, geotechnical profiles obtained by seismic
methods shall be calibrated/confirmed with actual profiles taken by bores at intermediate locations.

7 DETAILS OF EXPLORATION FOR FOUNDATION
RESTING ON ROCK
7.1
Basic Information Required from Explorations
i)
Geological system;
ii)
Depth of rock and
its variation over the site;
iii)
Whether isolated boulder or massive rock formation;
iv)
Extent and character of weathered zone;
v)
The structure of rock-including bedding planes, faults, etc.;
vi)
Properties of rock material, like, strength, geological formation, etc.;
vii) Quality and quantity of returning
drill water; and
viii) Erodibility of rock to the extent possible, where relevant
7.2
Exploration Programme
If preliminary investigations have revealed presence of rock within levels where the
foundation is to rest,
it is essential to take up detailed investigation to collect necessary
information mentioned in the preceding para.
7.2.1
The
extent
of exploration
shall
be adequate enough
to
give
a
complete
picture of the rock profile, both
in depth and across the channel width, for assessing the
constructional difficulties in reaching the foundation levels. Keeping this in view,
it shall be
possible to decide the type of foundations, the construction method to be adopted for a
particular bridge, the extent of even seating and embedment into rock of the foundations.
It
is desirable to take atleast one
drill hole per pier and abutment and one on each side
beyond abutments.
60



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
7.2.2
The depth of boring
in rock depends primarily on local geology, erodibility of
the rock, the extent of structural loads to be transferred to foundation, etc. Normally,
it shall
pass through the upper weathered or otherwise weak zone, well into the sound rock. The
minimum depth of drilling shall be as per para 3.2 above.
7.3
Detailed Investigations for Rock at Surface or at Shallow Depths
In case of rock at shallow depths which can be conveniently reached,
test
pits or
trenches are the most dependable and valuable methods, since they permit a direct
examination of the surface, the weathered zone and presence of any discontinuities.
For guidance, IS 4453 - Code of Practive for exploration by pits, trenches, drafts and shafts
may be referred to.
In case of structurally disturbed rocks,
in-situ tests may be made
in
accordance with IS 7292 - Code of Practice for in-situ determination of rock properties by
flat jack, IS 7317 - Code of Practice for Uni-axial Jacking Test for Deformation Modulus
and IS 7746 - Code of Practice for in-situ Shear Test on Rock.
7.4
Detailed Investigation for Rock at Large Depths
7.4.1
This covers cases where recourse
is to be made to sounding,
boring and
drilling. An adequate
investigation programme has
to be planned
to cover the whole
area
for general
characteristics and
in
particular the foundation
location,
for obtaining
definite information regarding rock-depth and
its variation over the foundation area. The
detailed programme
of exploration
will depend on
the type and depth
of overburden,
the
size and
importance
of the
structure,
etc.
To
decide
this,
geophysical
methods
adopted at the preliminary investigation stage may be helpful.
7.4.2
The investigation of the overburden
soil layers shall be done as per details
given for the foundations resting
in
soil. However,
in case of foundations resting on rock,
tests on overburden shall be carried out only when necessary, e.g., foundation level lower
than scour levels.
7.4.3
The core shall be stored properly in accordance with IS:4078 - Code of Practice
for Indexing and Storage of
Drill Cores. Wherever triple tube core barrel
in used, inner
most transparent plastic tube shall be stored directly in core box with sample.
7.4.4
The rock cores obtained shall be subjected to tests to get necessary data for
design as follows:
i)
Visual identification for
a)
Texture
61

b)
Porosity
c)

d)
Compressive strength
NOTE:
Generally, shear strength tests will suffice for design purposes. Other tests may need
to be done
in special case. The shear strength tests can be done as unconfined
compression, triaxial compression or direct shear test.
7.4.5
Use of
in-situ tests
for measuring strength and deformation
characteristics
may be made. Use of bore hole photography will be desirable to evaluate the presence of
faults, fissures or cavities,
etc.
Particularly
in weak and/or highly weathered rock, where
triple tube core barrel
is used for drilling,
in-situ tests such as Standard Penetration Test
and/or pressure meter test shall be conducted at every
1 .5 m interval in the influence zone
of footing or pile.
These
in-situ tests are also useful
in zones where water loss
is recorded during
drilling.
However selections of these tests have to be done judiciously and planned along with
drilling operation.
7.5
Special Cases
7.5. 1
investigation for conglomerate
A
drill hole shall be made same as for rock. The samples collected shall be subjected to
suitable tests depending upon the material. Special care shall be taken to ascertain the
credibility of the matrix.
7.5.2
investigation for iaterites
The investigation shall generally be similar to that required for cohesive soils.
In case of
hard iaterite, recourse may have to be made to core drilling as for soft rocks.

8 CLASSIFICATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ROCKS
8.1
Identification and classification of rock types for engineering purposes may,
in general, be
limited
to broad,
basic physical condition
in accordance with accepted
practice. Strength of parent rock alone
is of limited value because overall characteristics
depend
considerably on
character,
spacing and
distributions
of discontinuities
of the
rock mass, such as, the joints, bedding, faults and weathered seams.
8.2
Classification of Rocks
Rocks may be classified based on their physical condition and Unconfined Compressive
Strength as per Table-2.

(Clauses 708.2, 708.3 and 708.4)
PROCEDURE FOR STABILITY CALCULATION
1 FORMULA FOR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE PRESSURE IN SOIL
The
active and passive pressure
co-efficient (Ka & K
p
respectively)
shall be
calculated
according to Coulomb's formula taking into account the wall friction. For cohesive soils, the
effect of
'c' may be added to the same as per procedure given by Bell. The value of angle
of wall friction may be taken as 2/3
rd of 0 the angle of repose
is subject to a
limit of 22
2
degrees. Both the vertical and horizontal components shall be considered
in the stability
calculations.
2 SKIN FRICTION
The relief due to skin friction shall be ignored unless specifically permitted by the Engineer-
in-charge. However,
in case of highly compressive
soils, skin
friction,
if any, may cause
increased bearing pressure on the foundation and shall be dully considered.
3 FACTOR OF SAFETY OVER ULTIMATE PRESSURES
The
factor of safety
in assessing the allowable passive
resistance
shall be 2
for load
combinations without wind or seismic forces and
1.6 for load combinations with wind or
seismic forces. The manner of applying factor of safety shall be as indicated below:
i)
Pier wells founded in cohesive soils
The factor of safety as stipulated for the type of soil shall be applied for
the net ultimate
soil resistance,
viz., (P
- P
g ) where P
p and P
a are
total
passive and active pressure respectively mobilised beJow the maximum
scour level.
ii)
Abutment wells in both cohesive and non-cohesive soils
In the case
of abutment wells, the active pressure on
soil above the
maximum scour level (triangular variation of pressure) shall be separately
evaluated and considered as load combined with the other loads acting
on the abutment and no factor of safety
shall be taken
for the above
components of active pressure. Effects of surcharge due to live load should
be restricted only upto the abutment portion.

However, the laterai resistance of soil below the scour level at ultimate
value shall be divided by the appropriate factor of safety, viz., (p _ pj
as
stated in the case of pier wells.

Appendix-4
(Clause 708.13)
PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN DURING SINKING OF WELLS
1 CONSTRUCTION OF WELL CURB AND STEINSNG
1 .1
Cutting edge and the top of the well curb shall be placed truly horizontal.
1.2
The methods adopted for placing of the well curb shall depend on the
site
conditions, and the cutting edge shall be placed on dry bed.
1.3
Well steining shall be
built
in
lifts and the
first
lift shall be
laid after sinking
the curb atleast partially for stability.
1.4
The steining shall be
built
in one straight line from bottom to top and shall
always be at right angle to the plane of the curb.
In no case,
it shall be
built plumb
in
intermediate stages when the well
is tilted.
1.5
In
soft
strata prone
to settlement/creep,
the construction
of the abutment
wells
shall be taken up after the approach embankment for a
sufficient distance near
the abutment has been completed.
2 SINKING
2.1
A sinking history record be maintained at site.
2.2
Efforts shall be made to sink wells true to position and in plumb.
2.3
Sumps made by dredging below cutting edge shall preferably not be more
than half the internal diameter.
2.4
Boring chart shall be referred to constantly during sinking for taking adequate
care while piercing different types of strata by keeping the boring chart at the
site and
plotting the
soil as obtained for the well steining and comparing
it with earlier bore data
to take prompt decisions.
2.5
When the wells have to be sunk close to each other and the clear distance
is less than the diameter of the wells, they shall normally be sunk in such a manner
that the difference in the levels of the sump and the cutting edge
in the two wells do
not exceed half the clear gap between them.
71



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
2.6
When group of wells are near each other, special care is needed to ensure that
they do not fail
in the course of sinking and also do not cause disturbance to wells already
sunk. The minimum
clearance between
the
wells
shall be
half the
external
diameter.
Simultaneous and
level
dredging
shall be
carried
out
in
the dredging
holes
of
all
the
wells in the group and plugging of all the wells be done together.
2.7
During construction
partially sunk wells shall be taken to a safe depth below
the anticipated scour levels to ensure their safety during ensuing floods.
2.8
Dredged material shall not be deposited unevenly around the well.
3 USE OF KENTLEDGE
3.1
Where a
well
is loaded
with Kentledge
to provide additional sinking
effort,
such
load
shall be
placed
evenly on
the
loading
platform,
leaving
sufficient space
in
the middle to remove excavated material.
3.2
Where
tilts are present or there
is a danger of well developing
tilt, the position
of the load
shall be regulated
in such a manner as to provide greater sinking
effort on
the higher side of the well.
4 SAND BLOWS
IN WELLS
4.1
Dewatering
shall
be
avoided
if sand
blows
are
expected. Any equipment
and men working
inside the well
shall be brought out of the well as soon as there are
any indications of a sand-blow.
4.2
Sand blowing
in wells can often be minimized by keeping the
level of water
inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding heavy kentledge.
5 SINKING OF WELLS WITH USE OF DIVERS
5.1
Use of divers may be made
in well sinking both for sinking purposes,
like,
removal of obstructions, rock blasting,
etc. as also for inspection.
All safety precautions
shall be taken as per any acceptable safety code for sinking with divers or any statutory
regulations in force.
5.2
Only
persons
trained
for
the
diving
operation
shall
be
employed. They
shall work under expert supervision. The
diving and
other equipments
shall be
of an
acceptable standard.
It shall be well maintained for safe use.
72



======================================================================

IRC:78-2014
5.3
Arrangement
for ample
supply
of
low
pressure
clean
cool
air
shall
be
ensured through an armored
flexible hose
pipe. Standby compressor
plant
will have
to be provided in case of breakdown.
5.4
Separate
high
pressure
connection
for
use
of
pneumatic
tools
shall
be
made.
Electric
lights, where provided,
shall be
at 50 volts (maximum). The
raising
of
the
diver from
the bottom
of wells
shall be
controlled so
that the decompression
rate
for divers conforms to the appropriate rate as laid down in the regulation.
5.5
All men employed for diving purpose shall be certified to be
fit for diving by
an approved doctor.
6 BLASTING
6.1
Only
light charges
shall be used under ordinary circumstances and should
be fired under water well below the cutting edge so that there
is no chance of the curb
being damaged.
6.2
There shall be no equipment inside the well nor shall there by any labour in
the close vicinity of the well at the time of exploding the charges.
6.3
All
safety
precautions
shall
be
taken
as
per
IS
4081
"Safety Code
for
Blasting and
Related
Drilling
Operations",
to the
extent
applicable, whenever
blasting
is
resorted
to. Use
of
large
charges,
0.7
kg.
or above, may
not be
allowed
except
under expert
direction and
with
permission
from
Engineer-in-charge.
Suitable
pattern
of charges may be arranged with delay detonators
to reduce the number of charges
fired
at a
time. The burden
of the charge may be
limited
to
1 m and the spacing
of
holes may normally be kept 0.5 to 0.6 m.
6.4
If rock blasting
is to be done for seating of the well, the damage caused by
the
flying
debris should
be minimised
by
provisions
of rubber mats covered over the
blasting holes before blasting.
6.5
After blasting, the steining
shall be examined for any cracks and corrective
measures *shall be taken immediately.
7 PNEUMATIC SINKING
7.1
The pneumatic sinking
plant and other
allied machinery
shall
not only be
of proper design and make,
but also
shall be worked by competent and
well
trained
personnel. Every part of the machinery and
its fixtures shall be minutely examined before
73



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
installation and use. Appropriate spares, standbys, safety of personnel as recommended
in the IS 4188 for working in compressed air must be kept at site. Safety code for working
in and other labour laws and practices prevalent in the country, as specified to provide safe,
efficient and expeditious sinking shall be followed.
7.2
Inflammable materials shall not be taken
into air locks and smoking shall be
prohibited.
7.3
Whenever gases are suspected
to be oozing out of dredge
hole, the same
shall
be
analysed
by
trained
personnel and
necessary
precautions adopted
to
avoid
hazard to life and equipment.
7.4
Where blasting
is resorted
to,
it shall be carefully controlled and
ail precautions
regarding blasting shall be observed. Workers shall be allowed inside after blasting only when
a competent and qualified person has examined the chamber and steining thoroughly.
7.5
The weight of pneumatic platform and that of steining and kentledge,
if any,
shall be sufficient to resist the
uplift from
air inside, skin
friction being neglected
in this
case.
7.6
If at any section the
total weight acting downwards
is
less than the
uplift
pressure of air inside, additional kentledge shall be placed on the well.
7.7
If
it
is possible to make the well heavy enough during excavation; "Blowing
Down" may
be
used. The men
should
be withdrawn
and
the
air
pressure
reduced.
The
well
should
then
begin
to move
with
a
small
reduction
in
air
pressure.
"Blowing
Down" should only be used where the ground
is such that
it will not heave up inside the
chamber when the pressure
is reduced. When the well does not move with a reduction
in
air pressure,
kentledge should be added.
Blowing down should be
in
short stages
and the drop should not exceed, 0.5 m of any stage. To control sinking during blowing
down, use of packs or packagings may be made.
8 TILTS AND SHIFTS OF WELLS
8.1
Tilts and
shifts
shall
be
carefully checked and
recorded
regularly
during
sinking operations.
For the purpose
of measuring the
tilts along and
perpendicular
to
the axis of the bridge,
level marks at regular intervals
shall be painted on the surface
of the steining of the well.
8.2
Whenever any
tilt
is
noticed, adequate preventive measures,
like,
putting
eccentric Kentledge,
pulling,
strutting, anchoring or dredging unevenly and depositing
74



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 110
======================================================================
IRC:78-2014
dredge material unequally,
putting obstacles below cutting edge,
after jetting
etc.,
shall
be adopted
before any
further
sinking.
After
correction,
the dredged
material
placed
unevenly shall be spread evenly.
8.3
A pair of wells close to each other have a tendency to come closer while
sinking. Timber
struts may be
introduced
in between
the
steining
of these
wells
to
prevent tilting.
8.4
Tilts
occurring
in
a
well
during
sinking
in
dipping
rocky
strata
can
be
safeguarded by suitably supporting the kerb.
9 SAND ISLAND
9.1
Sand
island where provided
shall be
protected against scour and the top
level
shall
be
sufficiently above
the
prevailing water
level
so
that
it
is
safe
against
wave action.
9.2
The dimension
of the sand
island
shall
not be
less then
three times the
dimension in plan of the well or caisson.

IN INTERMEDIATE GEO-MATERIAL AND ROCK
9.1
Axial Load Carrying Capacity
:
Piles
in rocks and weathered rocks of varying degree of weathering derive their capacity
by end bearing and socket side resistance. The ultimate load carrying capacity may
be calculated from one of the two approaches given below:
Where cores of the rock can be taken and unconfined compressive strength directly
established using standard method of testing, the approach described
in method
1
shall be used.
In situations where strata
is highly fragmented, where RQD
is
nil or
(CR+RQD)/2 is less than 30 percent, or where strata is not classified as a granular or
clayey soil, or when the crushing strength is less than
1 0 MPa, the approach described
in method 2 shall be used. Also, for weak rock like chalk, mud stone, clay stone, shale
and other intermediate rocks, method 2 is applicable.

IN ROCKS
For establishing the similarity of soil strata actually met while advancing the pile-bore with
the strata selected for terminating the pile on the basis of N values equivalent energy method
can be used.
The concept of Pile Penetration Ratio (PPR) is used in this method.
The pile penetration ratio (PPR) reflects the energy in ton-meter required to advance
the pile bore of one sq. meter cross-sectional area by
1 cm.

The filter material shall be well packed to a thickness of not less than 600 mm with smaller
size towards the soil and bigger size towards the wall and provided over the entire surface
behind abutment, wings or return walls to the full height.
Filter materials need not be provided in case the abutment is of spill through type.
2.2

4 PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN DURING CONSTRUCTION
4.1
The sequence of filling behind abutments, wing walls and return walls shall
be so controlled that the assumptions made in the design are fulfilled and they should
clearly be indicated
in the relevant drawings. For example,
if the earth pressure
in
front of the abutment
is assumed
in the design, the front
filling shall also be done
simultaneously along with the filling behind abutment, layer by, and in case the filling
behind abutment before placing the superstructure
is considered not desirable, the
filling behind abutment should also be deferred to a later date.
In case of tie beams
and friction slabs, special care shall be taken in compacting the layer underneath and
above them so that no damage
is done to them by mechanical equipment.
4.2
Special precautions should be taken to prevent any wedging action against
structures, and the slopes bounding the excavation for the structure shall be stepped
or strutted to prevent such wedging action.
4.3
Adequate number of weep holes not exceeding one metre spacing in both
directions should be provided to prevent any accumulation of water and building up of
hydrostatic pressure behind the walls. The weep holes should be provided above the
low water level.

Appendix-7
(Clause
- 709.2.4)
PART-1
METHOD-1: PILE LOAD CAPACITY BY DYNAMIC TEST USING
WAVE EQUATION
This method is based on solving wave equation by using idealized model using strata wise
soil parameters to arrive at pile 'set' for given pile load. The force and velocity response of
pile to an impact force applied axially by drop of hammer causing large strain at top of pile
(of the order of magnitude of ultimate capacity of pile) are measured to arrive at the ultimate
capacity of pile.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
For
piles
considering
resistance
from
surrounding
soil,
the
internal
force
and
displacements produced on segment of prismatic bar subjected to impact at one end,
the wave equation can be derived as
where
D
=
longitudinal displacement of a point of the bar from
its original position
E
=
modulus of elasticity of bar p =
density of bar material +
t = time
x
=
direction of longitudinal axis & R =
soil-resistance term
The above equation may be solved for appropriate boundary conditions and the relationship
among displacement, time, position in the pile and stress are determined usually by numerical
methods. Solution requires idealization of model considering load deformation diagram for
each segment, the 'quake'
i.e. maximum deformation that can occur elastically,
'Ru' the
ultimate soil resistance and the damping factor. The empirical value of 'quake', damping
factor and percent side adhesion as reported by Forehand and Reese are reproduced for
reference in Table 1.

PILE AND TEST PREPARATION
1)
The testing should be conducted by fixing instrumentation that should include strain
sensors and accelerometers to the sides of the pile at a depth of 1 .5 x pile diameters
from top of pile and then connecting them to the measuring equipment.
2)
For this
it
is desirable that the pile
is extended to suitable length after chipping top
loose
concrete. This can be done
either using formwork or permanent casing.
Alternatively
if
it is a liner pile, two openings/windows approximately 300 mm x 300
mm and diametrically opposite to each other shall be made into the liner at
1 .5 x pile
diameter from top.
3)
In case pile head
is extended,
it shall be axial,
flat and have same strength as pile
concrete. The pile head may even be one grade higher so as to attain early strength.
The rebars and
helical reinforcement shall also be extended to avoid cracking of
concrete under hammer impact.
Refer to Fig. 1 for a sketch of reinforcement in the extended pile and the diameter of
bars shall generally be the same as pile reinforcement. Further, the concrete at the
sensor level shall be smooth hard and uniform.

A pile top cushion consisting of sheets of plywood with

5)
Steel helmet 25 mm-50 mm thick or as determined by the Test Engineer shall be
kept ready at the time of testing.
6)
A hammer of suitable weight (1-2 percent of test load or 5-7 percent of the dead weight of
the pile whichever is higher) shall be used for testing the pile unless specified otherwise
by the Test Engineer. The fall height generally varies from 0.5 m to 3 m.
7)
Wherever essential, a suitable guide
shall be provided to ensure a concentric
fall.

PILE MONITORING
The
testing
may
be
conducted
atleast
15
days
after
the
pile
is
installed
and
the
concrete
pile
as
well
as
extended
portion
if any
has
achieved
the
required strength.
Dynamic
pile
testing
(based
on
wave
equation)
should
be
conducted
by
attaching
strain
transducers
and
accelerometers
to
the
sides
of
the
pile,
approximately
1.5 times
pile diameter below the
pile top. A pair of transducers
/
needs
to be fixed onto opposite sides of the
pile, so as
to detect bending
in/
the pile
if any, during testing.
These
transducers
should
be
then
connected
through
the
cable
to
measuring
equipment to record strain and acceleration measurements and display them on an
oscilloscope or screen.
The testing should be conducted by impacting the
pile with blows of the hammer,
generally starting with a smaller drop of 0.5 m. For each hammer blow, the strain
transducers
should measure
strains whereas
accelerations
are measured
by
accelerometers connected on
either sides
of the
pile. These
signals are then
converted to digital form by the equipment and then converted to force and velocity
respectively by integration.
For each hammer blow, the test system should display immediate field results
in the form of the mobilized capacity of the pile, pile top compression,
integrity,
stresses etc. The force and velocity curve shall be generally as defined in ASTM
D4945.
Testing should be continued by increasing height fall of the hammer by approximately
0.5 m increment
till the time either the
pile set or the
pile capacity reaches the
required limiting values. Atypical force velocity response is also described in Fig. 3.
The pile capacity shall be generally considered to be fully mobilized if the energy levels
due to hammer impact are sufficient so as to cause a measurable net displacement
of atleast 3-4 mm per blow for a minimum three successive impacts.
If the pile set
is less than 3-4 mm per blow and the pile achieves required capacity, then
it implies
that not
all the static pile resistance has been mobilized and that the pile
still has
some capacity that could not be measured or was not required to be measured at
the time of testing.

METHOD-2: PILE DYNAMIC TEST METHOD BASED ON
HILEY'S FORMULAE
(BY LASER/INFRARED OPERATED EQUIPMENT)
1 INTRODUCTION
Since the early days of driven piles, the termination criteria based on "Sets observed", are
followed. Various formulae are available. The IS Code 2911 Part -
1 covering driven piles
provides one such formula. The principle followed
is recording the penetration per blow
of the hammer, and on that basis having obtained the desired set i.e. average penetration
of standard numbers of blows of hammer, the ultimate capacity for the pile
is worked out
and then with suitable factor of safety the safe capacity
is arrived
at. The bored cast-
in-situ
piles after attaining strength
(i.e.
after curing) can be treated as precast
pile to
be advanced further
in the founding strata
(i.e. strata on which terminated) by dynamic
impact energy. The load carrying capacity of bored cast-in-situ
pile subjected to impact
energy can then be estimated on measuring consequent displacement by sophisticated
optoelectronic instruments on resorting to IS 2911 procedure. The procedure will help
in
ascertaining the quality of workmanship on a large number of piles without much of time
wasting and avoiding delays in a construction activity with relatively less cost.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology of test
is based on a large falling weight giving the dynamic impact to
the elastic body.
It equates the energy of hammer blow to work done
in overcoming the
resistance of the founding
strata to the penetration of the ordinary cast-in-situ
piles as
well as grouted micro
piles. Allowance
is made for losses of energy due to the elastic
compression of the pile, and subsoil as well as losses caused by the impact of the pile. The
Modified Hiley's formulae given in the code IS 2911 Part -1, Section
I are used in estimating
the ultimate driving resistance
in tonnes. Applying the factor of safety as outlined
in the
code, the safe load on pile can be worked out.
The instantaneous displacements including rebounds of the pile are precisely recorded
in
automatic data acquisition system. This is done for several cycles and then using formulae
as accepted
in IS Code 2911 the safe loading capacity is calculated. The opto-electronic
instrument
is
used
for
position
sensitive
measurement
by
non
contact
continuous
measurement, using instrument placed away from the vibrations due to impact load. The
system
is based on combined
light emitting diode transmitters and a position sensitive
detector The transmitter and receiver are installed so that the infrared light beam forms a
reference line from transmitter, receiver to the prism group reflectors. The reflected light is

received and recorded 100 times per second. Using the energy transmitted to the pile and
accounting for temporary compression of pile, ground and dolly occurring during the impact
loading, the ultimate driving resistance
is calculated. Applying the factor of safety the safe
load for the pile is calculated.

90 percent of the maker's rated energy in tonne-centimeter per blow should
be substituted for the product {Wh)

can then be substituted
in modified Hiley's formulae stated
in IS 2911. The ultimate
load carrying capacity of the pile can be worked out, resorting to the modified Hiley's
formulae outlined in the code and from that the safe load carrying capacity of pile can
be estimated.

PART-2
STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR LOW STRAIN PILE INTEGRITY TESTING
1 SIGNIFICANCE AND USE
Pile Integrity Testing (PIT)
is a Non-Destructive integrity test method for foundation piles.
The method evaluates continuity of the pile shaft and provides information on any potential
defects due to honeycombs,
necking, cross-section
reduction,
potential
bulbs, sudden
changes in soil stratum, concrete quality in terms of wave speed etc.
It is known as "Low
Strain" Method since
it requires the impact of only a small hand-held hammer and the
resultant strains are of extremely low magnitude. The test procedure is standardized as per
ASTM D5882 and also forms part of various specifications and code provisions worldwide as
indicated in Table-3. The number of tests shall be decided by the engineer to the project.

2 TYPICAL METHODS
Various methods used to evaluate the integrity of the pile are briefly described below.
The evaluation of PIT records can be described as follows.
Pulse-Echo Method (or Sonic Echo - a time domain analysis)
Force Velocity Approach
•
Transient Response Procedure (Frequency Domain Analysis)
•
Cross Hole Sonic Logging
The Force Velocity approach
is sometimes used to evaluate defects near the pile top that
maybe difficult to evaluate
in Pulse Echo Method. The Pulse Echo
is the most commonly
used method and
is described below.
3 TEST EQUIPMENT
The test should be performed using
digital data acquisition equipment like a Pile Integrity
Tester or any equivalent that meets ASTM D5882 requirements. The equipment must also
include a sensitive accelerometer, instrumented or non-instrumented hammer etc. The data
must be displayed
in the field for evaluations of preliminary data quality and interpretation
and a field printout should be possible.
4 TEST PROCEDURE
The testing
shall be conducted
at least 7 days after pile concreting by an experienced
engineer/technician. The concrete at the
pile top surface must be relatively smooth with
sufficient space for attachment of the motion sensing device and hammer impact area. The
testing involves attachment of an accelerometer onto the pile top (not near its edge) with the
help of bonding material like candle wax, vaseline etc. After attachment, the pile is impacted
with a hand-held device (a hand-held hammer).
The test involves collection of several blows during the stage of testing. All such similar
blows are averaged before display. For larger diameter piles of 600 mm and above testing
may be conducted on at least 3 locations, whereas minimum one location
is enough for
smaller diameter piles. The typical data sets for good or damaged pile shall generally be as
per Fig.1 and is also defined in ASTM D5882.

6 LIMITATIONS
Certain
limitations are inherent
in the low
strain
test method and hence
it should be
treated only as an indicator of quality of work and not as a conclusive test. The limitations
mentioned below must be understood and taken
into consideration
in making the
final
integrity evaluation.
1)
Integrity
evaluation
of
a
pile
section
below
a
crack
that
crosses
the
entire
pile
cross-sectional
area
or
a
manufactured
mechanical
joint
is
normally
not
possible
since
the
impact
wave
likely
will
reflect
completely
at
the
discontinuity.
2)
Piles
with
highly
variable
cross-sections
or
multiple
discontinuities
maybe
difficult to evaluate.
3)
The
method
is
intended
to
detect
major anomalies
and
minor
defects may
not be detected by this method.
4)
The
test
is
not
applicable
to
jointed
pre-cast
piles
or
hollow
steel
pipes
or
H-sections.
5)
The method cannot be used to derive the pile capacity.
