Flexible (Bituminous) pavements constitute over 90 percent of the total road network including
airfield pavements in India. Hot mixed bituminous materials and mixes are generally used for
the construction of base course, binder course and wearing course of a flexible pavement.
The paving bitumen (VG-10, VG-20, VG-30 and VG-40; as per IS:73),
is used as a binder.
It is either solid or semi solid at ambient temperature and converted into fluid state by either
heating or by addition of petroleum solvent or by emulsifying bitumen in water. High amount
of energy
is consumed
for heating of aggregates and bitumen
for construction
of roads
using traditional hot mix technology. The following are some of the disadvantages of hot mix
technologies:
>
High level of noise and air pollution
>
Emission of green house gases
>
Compromise with the durability of bitumen due to aging during heating
>
High energy consumption
>
Unsafe for maintenance crew
Another form of bituminous binder is the cutback bitumen, which is brought into fluid state by
adding petroleum solvent such as naphtha or kerosene
oil.
In the field, solvent evaporates
as the curing of cut-back bitumen takes place. This technology has limited applications due
to
its inherent disadvantages and
it is not environment friendly. The third type of bituminous
binder, which
is rapidly growing
is the cationic bitumen emulsion.
It available
in fluid state
at ambient temperature and
it
is prepared by microscopic dispersion of solid or semisolid
bitumen in water using collordal null and chemical emulsifiers.
Emulsion was developed for the first time in the 1900s and
its use in pavement applications
started
in
the
1920s. The
early use
of bitumen emulsion was
restricted
to
only spray
applications and as dust palliatives. Over the years, with development of new types, grades,
specifications, and availability of improved construction equipments and practices, emulsion
based cold mix technology offered a wide range of solutions for construction and maintenance
of roads.
In India, bitumen emulsion found
its use only in the 1970s. The entire world used 12 million
tonnes of emulsion during mid seventies, India consumed only 20,000 tonnes
till 1996, out
of the total bitumen consumption of about 2
million tones. However, there has now been
a steady
rise
in the use of bitumen emulsion
recently and
significant growth
in demand
of emulsion has been observed
after 2005. At the present time,
practically

construction and maintenance requirements can be met with the use of bitumen emulsion as
binder by way of warm and cold mix technologies. Judicious selection and appropriate use
of these technologies can yield significant economies, environmental benefits and energy
security as far as construction and maintenance of roads are concerned.
Lately, bitumen emulsion has also been used
in
half warm mixes, micro surfacing and
in
cold recycling; more especially
in
full depth reclamation works. Results obtained from field
trials conducted by CRRI and
oil companies on cold mixes and bitumen emulsion based
applications under different traffic and climatic conditions have been found to be encouraging.
Several factors that have lead to the increasing use of bitumen emulsion in road construction
and maintenance are listed below:
>
The energy scarcity and crisis.
>
Bitumen emulsions do not require petroleum solvent to make
it liquid.
>
Bitumen emulsions can generally be used without additional heating.
>
Concerns about reducing atmospheric pollution.
>
The ability of certain types of bitumen emulsions to coat damp aggregate
surface, which eventually reduces the
fuel requirements for heating and
drying aggregates.
>
Availability of a variety of emulsion types which have led to development of
new formulations and improved laboratory procedures in order to satisfy the
design and construction requirements.
>
The ability to use cold bituminous materials at remote sites.
>
The applicability of emulsions for use
in preventive maintenance so as to
increase the service life of existing distressed pavements.
>
Success stories of the use of warm and cold mix technologies in construction
and maintenance of rural roads.

Bitumen emulsion based mixes include:
a)
Cold Mixes (CM)
These mixes are normally produced with unheated aggregates and bitumen emulsion.
b)
Half Warm Asphalt Mixes (HWAM)
These mixes are produced by mixing bitumen emulsion,
or foamed bitumen with warm
aggregates (100±10°C), laid and compacted at a temperature between 80-90°C.
c)
Warm Asphalt Mixes (WAM)
These guidelines apply to the bitumen emulsion based cold mixes, which are suitable for
low to moderate
traffic and are not recommended for heavily trafficked roads and areas
where atmospheric temperature
is high. However, bitumen emulsion based patching mixes
for repairing potholes are recommended for all traffic and climatic conditions. For selection
of cold mix treatments for different traffic and climatic conditions, reference may be made to
Annex
I.
2 CHEMISTRY OF BITUMEN EMULSION, PRODUCTION AND HANDLING
2.1
Introduction
Emulsion
is a colloidal system, which finds vital place
in our daily lives.
Milk, Mayonnaise,
Paints, Lotions, Cream and Rubber latex are some of the well known examples. An emulsion is
a two phase system in which one constituent is dispersed into another. In each case, addition
of certain chemicals with mechanical processing
is required.
It should be well understood
that an emulsion system
is very complex and many variables may come
into
play, when
analyzing a particular type of emulsion system.
This chapter covers the basics of emulsion's chemistry pertaining to its composition, stability,
and performance
2.2
Composition of Bitumen Emulsion
Bitumen emulsion
is a two-phase system consisting of bitumen, water and one or more
additives which assist in its formation, stabilization and in modifying its properties. The bitumen
is dispersed throughout the water phase in the form of discrete globules, typically 0. 1 to 50 pm
in diameter, which are held in suspension by electro-static charge stabilized by an emulsifier.
Depending on the composition of raw materials, which go into bitumen emulsion, these may
include bitumen, water, emulsifier, acid or caustic, polymers, salts, solvents, additives, and
emulsion stabilizers.
2.2.1
Bitumen
It is a viscous material derived from refining of crude petroleum. The composition of bitumen
has a significant effect on process of emulsification,
its physical properties and subsequent
performance.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
2.2.2
\Naier
Water and hydrocarbons are not soluble in each other. Depending on
its source, water may
contain varying amount of dissolved salts such as calcium or magnesium carbonate (found
in "hard" water), or suspended particles of rust (iron oxide) or
silt (very fine clay particles).
Therefore, quality of water has significant effects on the stability and performance of emulsion.
Water containing calcium amounting to more than 75 ppm
is considered to be "hard water"
while water containing calcium less than 75 ppm is considered to be "soft water".
It is desirable
to use only "soft water" for making emulsion of bitumen.
2.2.3
Emulsifier
Emulsifier is a chemical additive that is added to water prior to the production of an emulsion.
Its function
is to stabilize emulsion during
its production, storage and transportation. The
amount and type of emulsifier
is also critical for determining the performance of emulsion,
when
it is applied in the field. A care in selection of emulsifier is thus absolutely necessary.
2.2.4
Acid or caustic
Acid or Alkali is added in combination of the emulsifier and water to "activate" the emulsifier.
2.2.5
Polymers
Polymers and rubber latex may be added
to emulsion
to improve physical properties of
residue. Polymers can improve resistance towards wear and tear of the pavement. These
may be added to the bitumen prior to emulsification
in a solid form. Polymers and rubbers
can also be added to the emulsifier solution
in the form of latex (small polymer particles
suspended
in water phase), which can be
in cationic or anionic form
(similar to bitumen
emulsion). The choice of polymer or latex type (i.e., natural or SBR latex, or solid SBS) would
depend on the physical properties desired.
2.2.6
Solvents
Solvents such as the diesel, heavy or
light gas
oil, kerosene, naphtha, etc are added to
bitumen emulsions to reduce the viscosity of binder. This is often done to allow proper mixing
of aggregate with emulsion and to keep
it workable. The highly volatile solvents, such as
naphtha and
light gas
oil, are used
in the case, where rapid curing or early return to
full
strength (due to relatively quick evaporation) is required. Medium cure cutback systems use
kerosene, while slow cure systems typically use diesel and heavy gas oil.
2.2.7
Additives
Additives may also be used to enhance the performance of bitumen
in emulsion. Additives
blended with bitumen prior to the emulsification can provide improved properties of emulsion
such as the uniform particle size, storage stability, curing, and adhesion to aggregate,
all of
which result in higher strength and resistance to water damage.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
2.2.8
Stabilizers
Stabilizers are used,
in case, where very high
stability of emulsion
is required (such as
demanding mixing grade applications) or where improved quality and higher storage stability
of emulsion are needed. Stabilizers are often not very effective as emulsifiers by themselves,
but are used in conjunction with emulsifiers to enhance their performance.
2.2.9
Structure of bitumen emulsion
Bitumen emulsions consist of very fine spherical droplets of bitumen suspended
in water.
Bitumen emulsion particles are small enough that they experience Brownian movement. One
gram of bitumen emulsion (a volume roughly equal to a sugar cube) can contain over one
billion bitumen droplets. These one billion droplets of bitumen in emulsion have a total surface
area of approximately
1 square meter. The typical structure of cationic bitumen emulsion
is
shown in Fig. 2.1.
Hydrophiiic Group
Fig. 2.1
Structure of Cationic Bitumen Emulsion
2.3
Production of Bitumen Emulsion
Most of the bitumen emulsions are manufactured by continuous process using a
colloid
mill, which consists of a high-speed rotor revolving at 1000 to 6000 revolutions/minute
in
a
stator. Hot bitumen and emulsifier solutions are fed separately but simultaneously
into
the colloid
mill. The temperature of two components
is critical to the emulsification process.
The viscosity of bitumen entering into colloid mill should not exceed 0.2 Pa-s (2 Poise).
If a
harder grade bitumen or modified bitumen is used, the emulsification process becomes more
difficult. Higher temperature
is needed to allow bitumen to be pumped into and disperse
in
the colloidal
mill; dispersion of bitumen requires more power input to the
mill, which further
increases the production temperature. Pressurized mills are used for bitumen having high
viscosity at normal emulsification temperature and to allow higher output with normal bitumen.
Emulsions with temperature up to 130°C are produced under high pressure and emulsion
output must be cooled down to below 100°C before being discharged into storage tanks. A
batch process can also be used for production of emulsion wherein the type of mixer used

is chosen to suit the consistency of end product.
It may either be a high-speed propeller for
low viscosity emulsion or a slow Z-blade mixer for paste-like industrial emulsion. Schematic
diagrams
of continuous and
batch type emulsion
manufacturing
facilities are shown
in
Figs. 2.2 and 2.3. Bitumen emulsion can be prepared using a on-site mobile plant or off-site
stationary plant. The mobile plant may save cost of transportation of water.

Classification of Bitumen Emulsions
Bitumen emulsions are classified into four categories: anionic, cationic, clay and non-ionic.
Cationic and anionic emulsions are widely used for construction and maintenance of roads.
The term anionic and cationic emulsions refer to the electrical charges surrounding bitumen
particles in emulsion. Emulsions are further classified on the basis of how quickly the bitumen
droplets will coalesce. The terms RS, MS, SS and QS are relative terms only and have been
used to simplify the classification. These terms expand to mean Rapid-Setting (RS), Medium-
Setting (MS), Slow-Setting (SS) and Quick-Setting (QS).
IS 8887 prescribes specification for cationic bitumen emulsion. ASTM and AASHTO have
also developed
standards and
specifications
for various grades
of bitumen
emulsions.
The various gradings of emulsions, as mentioned
in
IS, ASTM and AASHTO, are shown
in

1)
The numbers and
letters relate to viscosity of the emulsion and hardness of base
bitumen. The letter 'C denotes to cationic. The addition of 'h' means that harder base
bitumen has been used.
2)
Only cationic emulsions are used
in India.
Rapid Setting grade of bitumen emulsion (RS-1), specified
in Indian Standard,
is specially
recommended
for tack coat application, while Rapid
Setting grade
of emulsion RS-2
is
recommended for surface dressing work. A Medium Setting grade of emulsion (MS) is used
for mixes with high coarse aggregates (minimum of 80 percent)
all of which are retained
on 2.36 mm IS Sieve and practically none of which pass through 180 micron IS Sieve size.
MS
grade
is also used for surface dressing and Penetration Macadam. Slow Setting grade
(SS-1) is used for other applications such as fog seal, crack seal and prime coat, while Slow
Setting grade SS-2
is used for plant mixes with graded and fine aggregates, a substantial
quantity of which should pass 2.36 mm IS Sieve size, and a portion of which should pass 75
micron IS Sieve size.
The emulsion for micro-surfacing
is required to meet IRC/ISSA specifications. A requirement
of 3 percent of solid of rubber/polymer by weight of bitumen in the emulsion is always needed
for compliance. The addition of rubber additive enhance the high temperature performance
of bitumen and permits application of micro-surfacing
in filling of ruts. Adding one letter (P,
S or L) to the end of the grade (e. g. CRS - 2P) normally designates the modified emulsion.
Specifications of cationic emulsion (ASTM D 2397, AASHTO M 208) permit solvent in some
grades but
restrict the amount. Some user agencies specify an additional cationic sand-
mixing grade designed as CMS - 2S, which contains more solvent than other cationic grade,
while IS:8887 does not permit addition of solvent/water.
2.5
Variables Affecting Quality of Bitumen Emulsion
There are many factors which
affect the production, storage, use, and performance of a
bitumen emulsion that
it would be difficult to single out any one variable as being the most
significant one.
Nevertheless,
certain
variables
having
significant
effect on
quality and
performance of emulsions include the following:
•
Chemical properties of bitumen
•
Consistency and quantity of bitumen
•
Particle size of bitumen in the emulsion
•
Quality and dose of emulsifier
8



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
•
Manufacturing conditions such as temperature, pressure, and shear rate
•
Ionic charge on the emulsion particles
•
Sequence of addition of the ingredients
•
Equipment used in manufacturing of emulsion
•
Properties of chemical modifiers or polymers
•
Quality of water particularly the hardness
These factors can be varied to suit the available aggregates or construction specifications.
It
is always advisable to consult the emulsion supplier with respect to a particular aggregate, as
there are few rules, which apply under all conditions, while some rules are material (aggregate
and emulsion) specific.
2.6
Properties of Bitumen Emulsions
The important properties of bitumen emulsions are given below:
•
Stability
•
Viscosity
•
Breaking and curing
•
Adhesion
2.6.1
Stability of emulsion
Emulsion having low bitumen content and low viscosity is prone to lower stability. The density
of bitumen at ambient temperature
is slightly greater than aqueous phase of emulsion and
eventually bitumen particles in such emulsion tend to settle down resulting
in a rich layer of
lower bitumen content. The velocity of dispersed phase particles in the downward movement
can be estimated by using Stoke's law.
=
2gr'(Pi -P2)
where,
g = gravitational force;
r = radius of particle;
= specific gravity of bitumen;
= specific
gravity of aqueous phase and n = viscosity of aqueous phase.
Therefore, the settlement can be reduced by equalizing the density of dispersed phase and
dispersion medium and
it can be achieved by adding buffer salts
like calcium chloride
in
aqueous phase.
2.6.2
Viscosity of emulsion
The viscosity of emulsion at conditions during spraying is of prime importance. The viscosity
of emulsion can be measured using orifice type viscometers such as Standard Tar Viscometer
or Saybolt Furol Viscometer.
9



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
The viscosity of emulsion can be enhanced by the following methods.
•
By increasing the concentration of dispersed phase (bitumen)
•
By increasing the viscosity of continuous phase
•
By reducing the range of particle size distribution.
The converse changes will, similarly, decrease the viscosity of emulsion. However, emulsion
viscosity is almost independent of the viscosity of dispersed phase (bitumen).
2.6.3
Breaking and curing
2.6.3.1
Breaking
If the bitumen emulsion is to perform its ultimate function as a binder, the water must separate
out from the bitumen phase and evaporate. This separation of water from bitumen
is called
"breaking". For surface treatments and seals, emulsions are formulated to break chemically
upon contact with a foreign substance such as aggregate and pavement surface. When
using anionic and cationic rapid-setting and medium setting emulsions, the breaking of the
bitumen emulsion droplets on the aggregate develops through electrochemical factors. For
slow-setting emulsions, the mechanism is through water evaporation. For dense mixes, more
time
is needed to allow for mixing and placement. Therefore, emulsions used for dense
mixes are formulated for delayed breaking. A rapid-set emulsion will have a short breaking
time (within one to five minutes after being applied), whereas a medium- or slow-set emulsion
may take longer time.
2.6.3.2
Curing
Curing involves the development of cohesion. The end result
is a continuous cohesive film
that holds the aggregate in place with a strong adhesive bond. For this to happen, the water
must completely evaporate, and the bitumen
particles have to coalesce and bond to the
aggregate. The water
is removed by evaporation, by pressure
(rolling), and by adsorption
onto the aggregate surface. Water evaporation can be fairly rapid under favourable weather
conditions,
but high
humidity, low temperatures,
or
rain soon
after application can defer
needed
curing. When medium
setting and slow setting grades of emulsion are used
for
paving mixes, the use of slightly damp aggregate facilitates the mixing and coating process.
The development of strength
in the slow setting types depends mainly on evaporation and
absorption. Mixing grade emulsion usually contains some petroleum solvent to aid
in the
mixing and coating process. During curing process, some of solvent evaporates.
2. 6. 3. 3
Factors affecting breaking and curing
The factors affecting the breaking and curing properties of cold mixes are given below:
•
Water absorption - A rough texture as well as porous aggregate decreases
the breaking and setting time by absorbing water
•
Aggregate moisture content - The wet aggregate facilitates easy coating
but
it tends to slow the curing process due to increased time needed for the
evaporation of water.
10



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
•
Weather
conditions - Temperature,
humidity, and wind
velocity have
a
bearing on water evaporation and emulsifier migration. The breaking occurs
more quickly at warmer temperatures but that
is not always the case. Hot
weather can also cause skin formation on chip seals. Chemical formulations
are available for faster breaking.
•
Mechanical factors - Roller pressure and, to a limited extent, slow moving
traffic, forces the water to evaporate from the cold mix and helps to attain mix
cohesion, cure and stability.
•
Surface area - Greater aggregate surface area, particularly excessive fines,
accelerates the breaking of emulsions and that is why sand equivalent test is
important.
•
Surface chemistry - Quantum of aggregate surface charge,
in combination
with the intensity of emulsifier charge, can affect setting rate, particularly for
cationic emulsions. Calcium and magnesium ions on the aggregate surface
can react with certain anionic emulsifiers and thereby can accelerate setting
process.
•
Emulsion
and
aggregate
temperature
-
Breaking
is
retarded
when
temperatures of emulsion and aggregate are low.
•
Type and amount of emulsifier - The surfactant used
in the manufacture of
emulsion determines the breaking characteristic of fine mixes.
The supplier of emulsion is the best source of information in order to control the above listed
parameters.
2.6.4
Adhesion properties
The quality of bond between bitumen and aggregate or existing surface depends on a number
of factors, as listed below:
•
type and amount of emulsifier
•
bitumen grade
•
pH of the emulsifier solution
•
particle size distribution of the emulsion
•
aggregate properties
2.7
Precautions for Storing and Handling
The following aspects need due consideration during the storing and handling of bitumen
emulsions:
•
Store preferably between 10°C and 50°C.
•
Should
not be
heated above 85°C,
as
at elevated temperatures water
evaporate and thereby, changing the characteristics of emulsion, may lead
to breaking.
11



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 100
======================================================================
iRC:SP:100-2014
•
Do not allow freezing. Freezing below 4°C may cause breaking of emulsion
leading to separation bitumen from water.
•
Do not allow temperature of surface to exceed 85°C. Since
it will cause pre-
mature breaking of the emulsion.
•
Do not use jet of air to agitate emulsion, as this may cause emulsion
to
break.
•
When heating bitumen emulsion, agitate
it gently to eliminate or reduce skin
formation.
•
Protect pumps, valves, and lines from freezing
in winter. Drain pumps and
service according to the manufacture's recommendations.
•
Blow out line and leave drain plugs open when they are not in service
•
Use pumps with proper clearances for handling emulsion. Tightly fitted pumps
can bind and seizep
•
Warm the pump to about 65°C to facilitate start-up.
•
When diluting bitumen emulsion, check the quality and compatibility of water
with the emulsion by testing a small quantity in a test tube.
•
If possible, use warm and soft water for dilution. Always add water slowly to
the emulsion (not the emulsion to the water).
•
Avoid repeated pumping and recalculating, as the viscosity may drop and air
may become entrained, causing the emulsion to be unstable.
•
Place inlet pipes and return lines at the bottom of tanks to prevent foaming.
•
Pump from the bottom of tank to minimize contamination from skinning.
•
Remember that emulsions with the same grade designation can be very
different chemically and also in performance.
•
Agitate emulsions gently that have been subjected
to prolonged storage.
This may be done by recirculation
•
Avoid breathing fumes, vapors, and mist
•
Obtain a copy of supplier's material safety data sheet (MSDS). Read MSDS
carefully and follow
it.
•
Do not mix different classes, types, and grades of emulsions
in tanks and
distributors.
•
Do not dilute rapid-setting grades of bitumen emulsion with water. Medium
and slow setting grades may however be diluted, but always add soft water
slowly to the bitumen emulsion.
•
Do not load bitumen emulsion into storage tanks, tank cars, tank transports,
or distributors containing remains of incompatible materials.

3.2
Testing
The testing of ennulsion is essential before its packaging, storage and release for transportation
to ensure the quality of product against the applicable requirements. Tests such as Penetration,
Ductility and Solubility in Trichloroethylene are also applicable on residue of bitumen emulsion
as
it has to perform the function of binder after breaking and evaporation of water. These
specifications describe the importance and significance of various test methods applicable
to bitumen emulsion to ensure the quality and application for intended use. Proper sampling
should be ensured as detailed in 18:8887-2004 before testing the bitumen emulsion.
3.2.1
Residue on 600 micron IS sieve
An emulsion
is characterized by the uniform distribution with respect to size of particles of
bitumen droplets
in aqueous phase. This dispersion should not contain foreign particles of
any type whatsoever, which are likely to clog the nozzles and filters of spraying equipments.
Therefore, sieve test
is considered as an important test to ascertain the quality of bitumen
emulsion.
In this test, previously weighed 4
liters representative sample
is filtered through
600 micron sieve at specified temperature (25 or 50°C) after rinsing the sieve with distilled
water except
in case of inverted emulsion (SS-1 grade). After filtering the emulsion, sieve
is repeatedly washed with distilled water until washings are clear and then dried
in oven at
105 ± 5°C for 2 hours and the residue over sieve
is determined by weighing. The complete
details of the test method experiment have been provided
in Annexure-B of IS:8887. The
weight of retained residue on sieve should not be more than 0.05 percent by mass, as per
the requirements indicated in IS:8887.
3.2.2
Viscosity by saybolt furol viscometer
Viscosity is defined as resistance to flow. The viscosity of emulsion
is an important property
and
it must meet the requirements of IS:8887. The viscosity of bitumen emulsion is measured
14



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
at 25 or 50°C by using Saybolt Furol Viscometer depending on the grade of bitumen emulsion
as per the test method given
in IS:3117. The results are reported
in Say bolt Furol seconds
(Fig. 3.1).
Fig. 3.1
Saybolt Furol Viscosity Measurement
3.2.3
Coagulation at low temperature
Coagulation test at low temperature
is performed to ensure the homogeneity and
stability
of bitumen emulsion,
if exposed or stored at sub-zero temperature.
In this test, 20 ml of
previously sieved homogenous bitumen emulsion
is transferred
in
to a
boiling tube. The
temperature of this
boiling tube
is brought to 30°C by plunging the tube
into water bath
previously set at 30°C with gentle stirring by a glass rod. Once the temperature of bitumen
emulsion
is constant at 30°C, the tube
is plunged into ice bath or refrigerator previously set
to 0°C with slow stirring by road. Once the temperature of emulsion reaches 0°C, the tube
is transferred into refrigerator for 30 minutes previously set at -3 to -4°C. Finally, the tube is
removed from refrigerator and brought to room temperature without any disturbance. The
emulsion is filtered through 600 micron IS sieve and sieve is washed with distilled water and
checked for residual bitumen (coagulation),
if any. As per the test method, there should not
be any deposit or coagulation on the sieve.
If emulsion
is expected to expose below -4°C
during storage and transportation, the coagulation
is checked after applying 3 freeze and
thaw cycles. The complete details of test are described in Annex-C of IS:8887.
3.2.4
Storage stability
Storage stability is an important property of bitumen emulsion and
it reflects the tendency of
bitumen globules settling down over a period of time. Storage stability of bitumen emulsion
is determined after 24 h of storage, as per IS:8887.
In this test, 500 ml homogenized and
previously sieved bitumen emulsion
is taken into graduated cylinder of 500 ml capacity and
left undisturbed in the laboratory for 24 h at room temperature. The samples, 50 ± 0.1 g each,
are taken from the top and bottom of the cylinder into previously weighed beakers of 600 ml
capacity. Both the beakers are heated in an air oven at 163 ± 2.8°C for 2 h. The beakers are
removed from the air oven and
left over residues are stirred and further kept in air oven for
1 h at the same temperature, so as to remove water from the residues. Both the beakers are
cooled and weighed to nearest 0. 1 g. The difference in the weight of residues should not be more
than 2 percent for RS-1
, SS-1 and SS-2 grades, whereas
it should not be more than
1 percent
15

IRC:SP:100-2014
for RS-2 and MS grades of emulsion as per IS:8887. The complete details of test method
are given in Annex-D of IS:8887.
3.2.5
Particle charge
The significance of this test
is to differentiate between the anionic,
cationic and inverted
emulsions.
In this test method, two steel plates, of size 25 mm X 75 mm, are immersed into
emulsion placed at a distance of 25 mm, which are connected to 12 volt DC circuit through a
switch, rheostat and a meter.
In the test, 4mA current
is passed between the electrodes for
30 minutes. At the end of experiment, the electrode plates are washed with distilled water
and inspected for any bitumen deposition. In case of cationic bitumen emulsion, the particles
of cationic bitumen emulsion get deposited on cathode during the experiment (Fig.
3.2).
However, there
is no deposition
of bitumen
particles on cathode
in case of anionic and
inverted bitumen emulsions. The complete detail of the test method has been provided
in
Annex-E of IS:8887specifications.
Fig. 3.2
Particle Charge Measurement
3.2.6
Coating ability and water resistance
The objective of this test is to determine the ability of bitumen emulsion to (i) coat the aggregates
thoroughly,
(ii) withstand mixing action while remaining as a
film on aggregates, and
(iii)
resist the washing action of water after the completion of mixing. This test
is developed to
basically identify the medium setting cationic bitumen emulsion and to evaluate its suitability
for mixing with coarse graded calcareous aggregates and
is not applicable for rapid setting
and slow setting bitumen emulsions.
In
this
test, 460 gm of aggregate (passing through
19 mm IS sieve and retained on 4.75 mm IS sieve)
is coated with calcium carbonate dust
(4 g) and then mixed with bitumen emulsion (35 g)
in a pan. About half of the mixture
is
then placed on absorbent paper for visual inspection of surface area of aggregate coated
with bitumen emulsion. The leftover mixture in the pan
is sprayed with water and rinsed with
water until the rinse water runs clear. This material
is placed on an absorbent paper and
inspected for status of coating. 'Good' status means the aggregates are fully coated with
bitumen except the pinhole and sharp edges of aggregate.
'Fair' status means the higher
surface area
is coated
in comparison to the uncoated surface area whereas 'Poor' status
means lower surface area
is coated in comparison to the uncoated surface area.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP;100-2014
The second
test
is repeated
in
the same manner as above
with
a
difference
that the
aggregates are wet with water (9.3 ml) before mixing with bitumen emulsion and then are
visually inspected for coating.
3.2.7
Stability to mixing witii cement
This test indicates the ability of slow setting bitumen emulsion to mix with a high surface area
material without breaking.
In the field, slow setting grade of bitumen emulsion (SS-2) is often
used with aggregates containing appreciable amount of fines and dust.
In this test, bitumen
emulsion sample (that has to be tested)
is diluted with water so that
it has bitumen content
equivalent to 50 percent. This sample (1 00 g) is mixed with cement (50 g, already sieved with
1 50 micro sieve) with steel rod for 1 minute. At the end of mixing,
1 50 ml boiled water is added
and mixed for 3 minutes. This mixture
is finally washed over 1.4 mm sieve. The material
retained on the sieve should not be more than 2 percent of bitumen present in the emulsion
as per IS:8887 specifications. The complete details of test method are given
in Annex-G of
IS:8887.
3.2.8
Miscibility witti water
The purpose of this test is to identify the types of bitumen emulsion
i.e. bitumen in water or
water in bitumen. Normally, cationic bitumen emulsions irrespective of the grades are miscible
with water, whereas an inverted emulsion (SS-1 grade)
is immiscible
in water.
In this test,
150 ml water, is mixed in 50 ml bitumen emulsion with constant stirring at room temperature.
The mixture
is allowed to keep for 2 h. As per IS:8887, there should not be any coagulation
of bitumen after 2 h. The test method is detailed in Annex-H of IS:8887.
3.2.9
Residue by evaporation
Residue by evaporation
provides a
fair idea of bitumen content present
in the bitumen
emulsion. This test is conducted on all grades of cationic bitumen emulsions except for invert
emulsion (SS-1
grade).
In this test, 50 g sample
is heated for 2 h
in a two
litre beaker at
163 ± 2.8°C
in air oven. At the end of this period, the residue of beaker
is stirred well and
further heated for
1
h at 163 ± 2.8°C
in air oven. The weight in percentages of the residue
is determined after cooling the beaker at room temperature. The details of test method are
given in Annex-J of IS:8887.
3.2.10
Tests on residue
Tests such as Penetration,
Ductility and Solubility
in Trichloroethylene are also applicable
to the residue of bitumen emulsion as
it has to perform the same function as bitumen after
coagulation, followed by evaporation and
drying
of water. The
penetration,
ductility and
solubility in trichloroethylene tests are conducted on residues as per the procedures given in
IS:1203, IS:1208 and IS:1216 respectively.
3.2.11
Distillation test
Distillation test is performed on Slow Setting grade of Emulsion (SS-1) in place of 'Residue
by Evaporation', as
it contains higher concentration of organic distillates along with water in
comparison to other grades of emulsion. The residue, obtained after distillation
at 360°C,
should not be less than 50 percent, as per IS:8887. The complete details of test method are
given in IS:1213.
17

PAGE 28 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
3.2.12
Water content
Water content
is determined only
in Slow grade of Setting grade of Emulsion (SS-1) by
following Dean Stark test method given
in IS: 1211. The water content in SS-1 should not be
more than 20 percent, as per IS;8887.
3.3
Sampling of Emulsion
The emulsion supplied by manufacture at site shall be collected from drums or tankers as per
procedures describe in IS:8887 and IS:1201.
In case of tanker, sample of emulsion shall be
taken (Fig. 3.3) using a 3 kg container mounted on a woodier rode (75 cm length and 2 cm
in
dia).
In case of drums, these have to be
rolled
to and
fro 5-6 times
at a distance of
4-5 meters. Sample

4 SPECIFICATION AND TESTING OF AGGREGATES
4.1
Introduction
The understanding of aggregates mineralogy and
its impact on the performance of emulsion
based mixes
is important. This section provide general information's on the composition of
rocks, and their interaction with different types of emulsions, and some of the basic tests that
are used to determine the suitability of aggregates for use in emulsion based cold mixes are
given below.
4.2
Aggregate
- Emulsion Interactions
For the purpose of predicting the performance of bitumen emulsion, rocks can be divided into
two broad categories. The "oxide" rocks consisting of those with high ratios of silicon oxide
(Silicate) or metal oxide content, and the "carbonate" rocks consisting of those with high ratios
of Lime stone or Dolomite type minerals. Most of the igneous rocks and Slag fall into the oxide
category, while most of the sedimentary rocks fall into the carbonate category. Metamorphic
rocks can be in either category, depending on their properties and composition.
Based on the above information and the general principle that using emulsions and aggregate
of opposite charges are beneficial, most of the aggregates used worldwide for paving are
silicate-based (siliceous) and that
is the reason why most of those areas specify cationic
bitumen emulsions. Anionic emulsions can be used with Lime stone and Dolomite types of
aggregates.
4.3
Testing
The following tests are considered important for deciding suitability of aggregates for cold
mixes.
•
Sand Equivalent Value Test
•
Methylene Blue Test
•
Shape Test
•
Gradation Test

IRC:SP:100-2014
•
Soundness Test
•
Aggregate Impact Value Test
•
Water Absorption Test
•
Stripping Test
The significance and brief of various tests are described below:
4.3.1
Sand equivalent value test
This test
is used
to determine the amount of fine clay particles. This test
is done as per
ASTM D 241 9 (AASHTO T
1 76) or IS:2720 (Part 37). The value of sand equivalent shall be
minimum 50.
4.3.2
Methylene blue test
This test is a measure of the relative surface area and surface reactivity of an aggregate's fine
fraction. A measured amount of methylene blue dye
is mixed with aggregate fines until the
fines can no longer absorb additional dye. The amount of dye necessary to surface saturate
the fines
is an indication of surface area and reactivity. This test is a good method of quality
control. As aggregates are supplied for a job, a steady Methylene blue value is an indication
that the clay fines content is unchanging. The test shall be done as per ISSA procedure given
in EN 933-09.
4.3.3
Shape test
The mineral structure of rocks plays a big role
in determining the shape of aggregate after
crushing.
For example, the minerals that contain certain planer crystalline structures
will
fracture
into
flat
pieces. The shape
of aggregate
is determined
by
using
flakiness and
elongation index tests, as per IS:2386 (Part-IV). The value of combined
Fl +
El
shall not
exceed 35.
4.3.4
Gradation test
Gradation
test
is
conducted
as
per
IS:2386
(Part-I)
for
conformity
of
construction
specifications.
4.3.5
Soundness test
The test procedure is described in IS:2386-1 963 (Part-V). This test indicates the susceptibility
of aggregates to disintegration under the action of water containing sodium and magnesium
sulphates. Washed and
dried aggregates
of specified
sizes are immersed
in
saturated
solution of sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate for
1 6 to
1 8 hours. This is then removed
and dried to constant weight. This forms one cycle. The test
is repeated for 5 cycles. After
5 cycles, the sample
is washed, dried
in an oven and re-sieved on those very sieves which
were used before the test. The weight of material retained on each sieve
is recorded. The
cumulative difference between the amounts weight of material on each sieves before and
after the test is the loss due to disintegration and
is expressed as percentage of total
initial
20



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
weight of the sample. The permissible values for loss
in sodium sulphate and magnesium
sulphate after 5 cycles are 12 percent and 18 percent respectively.
If the loss
is more, then
the aggregates are likely to disintegrate by water containing such salts. The test result
is to
be used as caution rather than as a definite evidence for rejection of the aggregates. The
test
is carried out when adequate information
is not available from service record of the
aggregates actually exposed to such weathering conditions.
4.3.6
Aggregate impact value test
Aggregate Impact value test
is a measure of resistance of aggregates to the disintegration
due to impact, which
in some aggregates differs from characteristics value of resistance
to crushing under slow compressive load.
In the aggregate impact value test, as given
in
18:2386-1963 (Part-IV) 12.5 to 10 mm sized clean dry aggregates of specified volume are
subjected to 15 blows by as 13.5 to 14.0 kg hammer falling from a height of 380 ± 5 mm. The
weight of sample of aggregate passing 2.36 mm sieve obtained after the test
is expressed
as a percentage of the original weight of aggregate and
is the aggregate impact value. The
aggregate impact values specified
for base,
binder and surface courses are 30, 27 and
24 percent respectively.
4.3.7
Water absorption test
Water absorption is the difference in weight of aggregates between 24 hours water saturated
surface-dry condition and oven-dry condition expressed as percentage of the latter. The test
procedure is given in 18:2386-1963 (Part-Ill). Water absorption is high for porous aggregates.
The maximum value of water absorption
is restricted to 2 percent for aggregates to be used
in road construction.
4.3.8
Stripping test
8tripping
is the displacement of bitumen film from a coated road aggregate particle
in the
presence of water. The details of test procedure are given
in 18:6241.
In this test, 200 g of
1 2.5 to 20 mm sized aggregates are coated with 5 percent bitumen under specified conditions
and immersed in distilled water at 40°C for 24 hours. The average percent uncoated area
is
observed under water. The amount of stripped area, expressed as per cent,
is the stripping
value. A higher stripping value indicates possibility of loss of adhesion between aggregates
and bitumen
in the presence of water. The degree of stripping
is
related
to the type of
aggregates, shape, size, grain-size, surface texture, mineralogical composition, presence of
dust or clay, moisture, acidity or alkalinity etc.
If there
is found to be any slight evidence of stripping either by qualitative estimation or
by quantitative measurement, incorporation of commercially available anti-stripping agent in
bitumen is recommended.
It is also recommended to carry out water sensitivity test (Retained
Tensile 8trength, as per A8TM D 4867)
if the minimum retained coating in the test is less than
95 %, meeting the requirement of MoRT&H standard.

5 SPRAY APPLICATIONS
5.1
Prime Coat
Prime coat
is an application of a low viscosity bitumen emulsion on a compacted granular
base course which penetrate into the base (>8mm). A prime coat performs several important
functions as given below:
•
Coats and bonds loose mineral
particles on the surface
of the granular
base
•
Hardens or toughens the surface of the base
•
Waterproof the surface of the base by plugging capillary or interconnected
voids
•
Provides adhesion or bond between the base and the bituminous mixture.
The emulsion grade
like SS-1
(Inverted Emulsion) has been developed
for priming. The
amount and size of voids in the granular base, temperature, sunshine, and wind will influence
the penetration process. In case of very dense surface,
it may be necessary to make multiple
applications. This
is done to improve penetration (>8 mm) and prevent runoff and pudding
of the emulsion. For better penetration and reduced tyre pickup catronic emulsion, additives
may also we used.
The choice of a bituminous primer shall depend upon the porosity characteristics of the
granular surface to be primed as classified in IRC: 16. These are listed below:
i)
Surface of low porosity: Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) and Water Bound
Macadam (WBM)
ii)
Surfaces of medium
porosity:
Mechanically
stabilized
soil
base,
lime/
cement stabilized soil and lime cement base
iii)
Surface of high porosity: Gravel base. Crusher Run Macadam (CRM) and
Crushed Rock Base
The type and
viscosity of the primer shall comply with the requirements of IS:8887, as
sampled and tested for SS-1 grade in accordance with standard. The quantity of SS-1 grade
bitumen emulsion for various granular surface shall be as per Table 5.1.

Primer shall not be applied during a dust storm or when the weather is foggy, rainy or windy
or when the temperature
in the shade
is less then 10°C. Surfaces to receive emulsion as
primer shall be damp, without standing water. The application of primer in progress is shown
in Photos 5.1 and 5.2. The details of prime coat application are given in IRC:16.

5.2
Tack Coat
Tack coat is a light application of low viscosity liquid bituminous material like emulsion to an
existing surface (bituminous/cement concrete/primed granular surface) to facilitate a bond
between the surface being paved and the overlaying course. The tack coat is recommended
for all types of overlays. The only possible exception might be when an overlay is to be placed
within 48 hours on a freshly laid bituminous surface that has not been subjected to any traffic
or contaminated by dust. Bitumen emulsions commonly used for tack coat are RS-1, SS-
1h, CSS-1 and CSS-1h. The detailed requirements of tack coat are given
in IRC: 16. The
recommended rate of application of tack coat is given in Table 5.2.

3)

The best results of tack coat are obtained
if
it is applied while the pavement surface
is wet
and the surface temperature is normally above 25°C. The surface to be tack coated must be
clean and free of loose mineral material. A good tack coat results
in a very thin but uniform
coating of residual bitumen on the surface, when the emulsion has broken. After spraying
the tack coat, sufficient time must be allowed before an overlay
is placed for the complete
breaking of the emulsion (brown to black colour).
The tack coat
distributor
shall be a
self propelled
or towed
bitumen
pressure
sprayer,
equipped for spraying the material uniformly at a specified rate. Small areas, inaccessible to
the pressure distributor, or in narrow strips, may be sprayed with a pressure hand sprayer.

The details of application of tack coat are given in IRC:16. The tack coat spraying in progress
is shown in Photo 5.3. The view of good tack coat is shown in Photo 5.4. The quality of tack
coat can be quantitatively determined by measurement of bond strength (by shear test) on
cores taken out from test section. A shear strength value of 2.0 kg/cm^ is acceptable for good
tack coat. A procedure for testing of bond strength
is given in Appendix-1.

5.3
Crack Sealing
Cracking
in the bituminous surface occurs in many forms varying from small hairline cracks
(less than
1 mm) to wide cracks having a width of 6 mm or more. Large or severe cracks may
not always be correctable by crack sealing using bitumen emulsion. Cracks generally fall into
one of the following categories.
•
Alligator Cracks
:
Interconnected
cracks
forming
a
series
of
blocks
resembling to skin of alligator or chicken wire.
•
Edge cracking : Cracking that occurs along the outer edge of the pavement,
usually within 300 to 600 mm of the edge. Such cracking occurs when paved
shoulders do not exist.
•
Reflective cracks
: Cracks in bitumen overlays and surface treatments that
reflect the crack pattern of the underlying pavement layers.
•
Shrinkage or block cracks
: Interconnected cracks forming series of large
blocks, usually with sharp corners or angles.
•
Slippage cracks
: Crescent shaped cracks that point in the direction of the
thrust of the wheels on the pavement surface.
•
Linear cracks
: A crack that may be parallel or transverse to the center line,
or randomly located in the pavement surface.
If cracking results from a deflection beneath the pavement surface,
it is always doubtful that
sealing the cracks by emulsion will provide a longer lasting solution.
24



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
The best time of sealing cracks is as soon as these develops. A crack can continue to widen,
so crack sealing must be done at the earliest. The failure to seal cracks properly can lead to
further and more severe pavement damage due to water intrusion or freeze-thaw. Sealing of
cracks with bitumen emulsion is relatively simple and inexpensive and can delay or postpone
major maintenance. Before cracks are to be
filled, loose material
in the crack should be
blown out using compressed air. The left out of foreign material in cracks not removed by air
blowing should be removed by steel wire brush or compressed
in.
Small and medium cracks, less than 6 mm width, are difficult to seal effectively. For large
cracks, bitumen emulsion (SS-2) mixed with sand, should be forced
into the crack
until
it
is about 3 to 6 mm from the surface. After curing has occurred, finish sealing by filling the
remaining depth by light application of dry sand to prevent pickup of material by traffic. The
recommended bitumen emulsion grade to be used for crack sealing is SS-2 or its equivalent.
A pressure distributor or sprayer may be used
for application of bitumen emulsion. The
Table 5.3 provides recommended criteria for crack sealing.

Fog Seal
Fog seal
is defined as "a light application of diluted (SS-2 or tailor made) bitumen emulsion
used primarily to seal an existing bitumen surface to reduce raveling and enrich dry and
weathered surfaces. Fog seal is a method of incorporation of bituminous binder to an existing
pavement to improve its waterproofing characteristics, preventing further stone loss by holding
aggregate
in place, rejuvenating surface and improving the surface appearance. However,
its inappropriate use can result
in a slick pavement. During application, bitumen emulsion
wets the surface of the aggregate. Cationic emulsion can displace water from the surface of
binder on the aggregate and existing binder film. The rate of breaking emulsion is dependent
on several factors including weather conditions (e.g. wind, rain, temperature, etc.).
Rejuvenating emulsion has oils that help in softening of the oxidized binder in existing surface,
thus reducing
its viscosity. This also improves the flexibility of the binder, which reduces the
possibility of cohesive failure. This may be beneficial
in situations where the surface has
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
an open texture and the existing binder has become hard and
brittle due to aging. As with
conventional emulsions,
if these do not penetrate the surface, they may create a surface
prone to skidding after they break. Fog seals are also useful in chip seal applications to hold
chips in place in fresh seal coats. These are referred to as flush coats. This can help prevent
vehicle damage arising from flying chips.
A Fog seal is
>
Designed to coat, protect, and/or rejuvenate the existing oxidiseal bitumen
binder.
>
Improve the waterproofing of the surface.
>
Reduce aging susceptibility of the surface by lowering permeability to water
and air.
>
To renew an old bituminous surface that has become dry, brittle and hungry
with age.
>
To seal small cracks and surface voids
>
To
inhibit raveling and whip-off chipping by
traffic on freshly
laid surface
dressing
Properly calibrated truck mounted distributors shall be used to apply the emulsion. Spray
nozzles with 4 to 5 mm openings are recommended. The emulsion may be heated to maximum
50°C, although, generally the emulsion
is sprayed at ambient temperature. The emulsion
is
sprayed at a rate that is dependent on the surface conditions. A test section representative of
the entire surface should be chosen to decide application rate. The total quantity of emulsion
in fog seal
is normally from 0.5-1.0 l/m^ of diluted SS emulsion
(1:1
dilution). The surface
condition or texture, dryness and degree of cracking of the pavement determine the quantity
required. Excessive application of the fog seal must be avoided as this will result in pickup of
bitumen by vehicles leading to a slippery surface. When excess emulsion
is applied, a light
application of fine sand on the affected area may be applied to prevent formation of sliding
surface. Photos 5.5 & 5.6 show Fog Seal application.

Limitations of Fog Seal
: These are given below
. v
1 )
Fog seals are not useful as seal coats on close graded surfaces without the
addition of aggregates as they may create a slippery surface.
2)
Fog seals should not be used on Rubberized Asphalt Concrete (RAC) or
polymer modified mixes unless the pavements are over five years old as
these binders age at a different rate.
3)
The application of fog seals
is also limited by weather.
It should be ensured
that the emulsion should fully cure before freezing conditions are encountered.
In addition, seal coats applied
in the winter have less time to penetrate the
pavement and are more prone to cause slick surface conditions.
4)
Over application
of the fog
seal
results
in the pickup
of the bitumen by
vehicles and possibly a slippery surface. When excess emulsion
is applied,
a
light
application
of
fine sand
on
the
affected
area may
correct
the
problem.
6 SURFACE TREATMENTS
6.1
Introduction
Surface treatments, involving the use of bitumen emulsion, are vital from routine as well as
preventive maintenance point of view. The thin surface treatments are used primarily for the
following applications:
>
To provide an economical, all-weather surface for
light to medium
traffic.
When polymer modified emulsion and
high
quality aggregates are used,
surface treatments may also be used for high volume traffic applications like
National Highways.
>
To provide a waterproof barrier that prevents the intrusion of moisture into
underlying layers
>
To provide a skid-resistant surface for the pavements that have become
slippery because of bleeding or polishing of aggregates.
>
To
rejuvenate
dry
and
weathered
surface. A weathered
and
raveled
pavement surface can be restored to useful service by application of a single
or multiple surface treatments.
>
To
provide
temporary
surface
for
a new
granular
or
bituminous
base
course.
>
To
rejuvenate
old pavements
that have
deteriorated because
of aging,
shrinkage or cracking. Such treatments have
little or no structural strength
27



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
but can preserve the existing structural value by water proofing and serve as
stop-gap measure until the regular rehabilitation is done.
The need
for a
strong base
or sound pavement under surface treatments cannot be
overemphasized since surface treatments are not designed to correct a pavement strength
that
is structurally deficient. The various types of surface treatments, involving the use of
bitumen emulsion, are discussed in the following sub-sections.
6.2
Seal Coat
Seal coat
is an application of bitumen emulsion based thin layer to an existing bituminous
surface. This type of maintenance treatment
is applied
primarily to improve the existing
pavement surface by providing a uniform treatment of seal coat to the surface and to improve
its resistance to water percolation. Therefore, seal coat provides an impervious membrane
that will slow down the rate of weathing of bituminous layer. The types of bitumen emulsion
that can be used for seal coat are SS-2, RS-2, SS-1
, SS-1 h, CSS-1 and CSS-1 h. Seal coats
are classified in two categories, as given under:
1)
Sand seal coat
2)
Liquid seal coat
Sand seal coat with bitumen emulsion many a time
is problematic due to lump formation
during mixing of sand with emulsion in mixer. Therefore, liquid seal coat should be preferred
over open graded premix carpet. For liquid seal coat, bitumen emulsion of RS-2 grade @
12-14 kg per 10 m^ area
shall be spread over premix carpet and then 6.3 mm passing
aggregate shall be spread over
it. The aggregate layer shall be compacted with 8-10 tonne
roller immediately after the spreading of aggregates to get the finished surface. The details
of this technique of construction are given in IRC-14.
6.3
Sand Seal
Sand seal is a spray application of bitumen emulsion followed by light cover of fine aggregates,
such as clean sand or screenings. Cold mixed sand seal can be useful in correcting a number
of surface defects. Usually, RS-1
, CRS-1
, MS-1 or HFMS-1 emulsions are applied at a rate of
about 0.70 to
1 .25 liter/m^. This is followed by application of about 5.5 to
1 2 kg/m^ of sand or
screenings cover.
In some locations, sand seals are used when good sources of aggregates
for chip seals are not available. The cold mixed sand seal
is used
primarily for following
applications.
•
Enrich a dry, weathered or oxidized surface. The sand seal will help to prevent
loss of material from the old surface by traffic due to abrasion.
•
Prevent the intrusion of moisture, when an existing pavement surface begins
to crack, moisture may pass into the underlying pavement structure thereby
reducing
its load bearing ability. A sand seal can provide a barrier to prevent
this intrusion.
28



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
•
Develop a skid-resistant surface texture. By selecting sharp and angular fine
aggregate, a highly skid-resistant surface can be provided.
6.4
Surface Dressing
Surface dressing consists of application of bitumen emulsion onto an existing road surface,
followed by the application of a single-sized cover aggregates. The aggregates are applied in
a single thickness over the emulsion layer and are then rolled in order to "seat" the aggregate
particles in the residual bitumen. This application may also be done in two or multiple layers.
Such seals are produced with large aggregate in the bottom layer and progressively smaller
aggregate
in the upper layers. The aggregate size, number of layers, and binder type are
chosen based on the projected traffic loading and the condition of existing surface.
Surface Dressing
is applied
to an
existing road surface as an economical maintenance
treatment. This should be used on roads that are in good structural conditions but are at a stage
in their life cycle, where stresses are developing. Surface Dressing will seal the underlying
layer from water intrusion, correct the surface cracking,
raveling, surface hardening, and
would be able to improve the skid resistance. Normally, surface dressing will not be able to
correct the full depth cracking, rutting, or conditions caused by base failures or incorrect mix
design reflected by shoving or bleeding.
The emulsion is applied by a mechanical spray distributor truck and aggregates are applied by
a specialized chip spreader. The application rates of emulsion and aggregate are determined
by a
laboratory design
method. The
ultimate
objective
is
to achieve 60
percent depth
embedment of aggregate
in the cured residual binder layer with 40 percent of aggregates
remaining exposed. Some illustrations of surface dressing are shown in Photos 6.1 & 6.2.
For Surface Dressing either rapid setting cationic or anionic (including high float) or modified
emulsions can be used. Clean aggregates containing very lowfines usually require rapid setting
types, while lower quality aggregates with higher water absorption may require medium setting
types emulsion to allow proper binder adhesion to the aggregate. For high traffic roads or in
more severe climatic conditions, latex or polymer modified bitumen emulsion may be used.
Since most of available aggregates are siliceous, cationic types emulsions are preferred for
desired adhesion, while anionic including high float emulsions may provide better adhesion
with calcareous aggregates under high temperature. The emulsions are of typically higher
viscosities which allow them to resist running off and to maintain an appropriate thickness
prior to the addition of aggregate. Emulsions offer several advantages over other types of
bituminous material as binder for surface dressing:
•
Emulsion can be used with damp aggregate
•
They do not need elevated temperatures for application
•
They eliminate the fire hazard associated with cutback bitumen
•
They eliminate pollution associated with cutback bitumen
•

Illustrations of Surface Dressing Using Bitumen Emulsion
One of the most important aspects of good performance of surface dressing using emulsion
lies
in the selection of correct type, grade, and application rate of emulsion as well as the
aggregates. When a proper grade
is selected, bitumen emulsion for the surface treatment
will have the following benefits.
•
•
Be fluid enough during application to spray properly and to cover the surface
uniformly

•
Retain proper consistency after application to wet the surface being treated
and the aggregate applied
•
Cure and develop adhesion to the aggregate and surface quickly
•
Hold aggregates tightly to the road surface after rolling and curing; preventing
loss of aggregate
•
Not bleed or
strip with changing weather conditions when applied
at the
correct rate
Table 6.1 presents the types of bitumen emulsion recommended for surface dressing. High
volume trafficked roads may require a polymer modified rapid-setting emulsion. For modified
emulsion, the aqueous phase of emulsion may be modified by 3 percent latex or SBR or
Natural Rubber. Table 6.2 gives the nominal application rates both for emulsion and chipping.
The use of these materials with relatively low temperature produces significant energy-saving.
For traditional surface dressing, RS-2 type cationic bitumen emulsion conforming to IS:8887,
is recommended. Type and grades of bitumen emulsion and the corresponding temperatures
recommended for spraying are given in Table 6.3.

The aggregate's quality used on the surface
is subjected to the abrasive action of traffic.
If aggregates are not hard enough to resist wear and tear, the pavement may become a
skid hazard when wet. Most of the hard aggregates can be used successfully for surface
treatments. The aggregate selected must also meet the job requirements
in terms of size,
shape, and cleanliness. The grading requirements are given in Table 6.4.

shall then be added
into wet gradually
aggregate and mixed
for two minutes to get uniform coating. Prolonged mixing
shall be
avoided as
it will decoat the aggregates.
The cold mix
shall be transported
to
laying
site and
shall be spread manually for loose
thickness of about 30 mm over the tack coated area. Rolling shall be done as described
in

The quantity of aggregate shall be 0.27 m^ for 10 m^ area. The quantity of bitumen emulsion
(SS-2) shall be 30 kg for Type A and 33 kg for Type B grading.
The base over which cold mixed MSS
is to be laid shall be completely free from dust and
mud. Where the existing base
is having potholes or rutting, defects shall be rectified before
laying MSS. For tack-coat, bitumen emulsion of Rapid Setting (RS-1) grade shall be used.
The bitumen emulsion is applied on an existing pavement, preferably on damp surface, at the
rate of 2-3 kg per
1 0 sq.m area. In case of dry and hungry surface, emulsion shall be used at
the rate of 3.5 kg per 10 sq.m. The tack coat with emulsion shall be applied not earlier than
30 minutes before laying the cold mix. The cold mix shall be laid when tack coat binder turns
black from brown colour.
It is imperative to prepare the cold mixed MSS using conventional
hot mix plant switching off heating arrangement or cold mix plant or any other suitable mixer
of adequate capacity. The plant may be either a batch type or a continuous type having
two-stage mixer. The bitumen emulsion shall be added into the mixer by having a separate
outlet from emulsion tank.
The aggregate
shall be charged
first
into the mixer/pug
mill followed by the addition
of
optimum water content (approximately 1-2 percent) to mixer and then adding the required
quantity of bitumen emulsion. The above ingredients shall be mixed for about one minute to
achieve the uniform coating. The cold mixed MSS shall be discharged for transportation to

laying site. The cold mixed MSS shall be transported from plant site by tipper trucks to the
laying site and spreading
will be done preferably by means of a self-propelled mechanical
paver at an appropriate speed capable of spreading, tamping and finishing the mix, true to
the proper grade, line and cross-section. The mix shall be spread in such a manner that, after
compaction, the required thickness of layer is laid uniformly for desired thickness.
Longitudinal joints and edges shall be constructed true to the
line marking parallel to the
centre
line of road. Longitudinal joints should be offset by at least 150 mm from those
in
binder course,
if any, and transverse joints or construction joints shall be placed in the original
thickness of previously laid mix. The vertical cut face shall be painted with bitumen emulsion
prior to the laying of fresh mix against
it.
The cold mixed MSS
laid with the paver,
after change of colour from brown to black due
to breaking of emulsion on surface of coated aggregate, shall be thoroughly and uniformly
compacted through a set of rollers at a speed not more than 5 km per hour. The
initial or
break down rolling shall be done with 8-12 tonnes three wheel steel roller followed by final
rolling with 8-10 tonnes tandem roller. Before finishing with tandem roller, break down rolling
shall preferably be followed by an intermediate rolling by smooth wheel pneumatic roller of
15 to 30 tonnes having a tyre pressure of 7 kg./sq.cm.
The joints and edges shall be rolled with 8-12 tonnes three wheel
roller. All the compaction
operations i.e. breakdown rolling, intermediate rolling and final rolling shall be accomplished
by using a vibratory roller of 8-10 tonnes weight. During final
rolling, the vibratory system
shall be switched off and wheels of roller shall be kept moist to prevent the mix from sticking
to them. Rolling shall commence longitudinally from edges and progress towards the centre
except on super elevated portions where
it shall progress from lower to the upper edge.
Rolling shall be continue till the desired density is achieved and all roller marks are eliminated.
Traffic shall be allowed after 3-4 hours provided the mix has been set and does not stick to
tyres of vehicles.
Adequate quality control at every stage of the work
is essential. A field laboratory shall be
set up to ensure the controls. Sieve analysis of each type of aggregate at feeder end should
be made to see that the gradation of aggregate reasonably follows the specified designed
gradation. The number of samples per day would depend upon the bulk supply of aggregates
made in a day at the plant site. The characteristics of these materials shall be determined at
the rate of one test for every 50-1 00 m^ of aggregates. Periodic checks on emulsion covering
binder content, viscosity and residue on 600 micron sieve should be done,
in accordance
with IS:8887. The emulsion should be thoroughly mixed by rolling the drum to and fro to a
distance of 10 metre for about 5 minutes before using emulsion for premixing with graded
aggregate. At least one sample for every 100 tonne of cold mix discharged at the pug
mill
chute or a minimum of one sample per plant per day shall be collected and necessary tests
carried out. Bitumen shall be extracted from about 1000 gm of the mix and bitumen content
determined. Sieve analysis of aggregates after the bitumen
is extracted shall be done to
determine compliance of standard gradation.

Slurry Seal
Slurry seal
is a mixture of dense graded aggregate, emulsified bitumen,
filler, additive and
water. The mixture
is applied as surface treatment on the existing surface. Slurry seal can
be used
for both preventive and corrective maintenance needs. This treatment dose not
increase the structural strength of a pavement. A pavement which is structurally weak, should
be repaired first for structural deficiency before applying slurry seal. Ruts, humps, distressed
pavement edges, crown deficiencies, or other surface irregularities that affect riding quality
should be corrected before placing slurry seal. Slurry seal is considered to be a very effective
maintenance technique for the surfaces of older pavements.
It will
fill the surface cracks, stop
raveling and loss of matrix, improve skid resistance, generally protect the pavement, reduce
water and oxidative deterioration, and finally extend the overall pavement service
life. Slurry
seal has the following major advantages:
•
Rapid application and quick return of traffic to the pavement
•
Excellent surface texture and friction resistance
•
Ability to correct minor surface irregularities
•
Minimum loss of kerb height
•
No need for manhole and other structure adjustments
•
Excellent low cost treatment for urban streets
Slurry seal
is applied
in a very thin layer of 3 to 6 mm. The grade of emulsion to be used
is
SS-2 conforming to IS:8887 or tailor made. The machine used for mixing and application
is a self-contained, continuous-flow mixing
unit, which accurately delivers materials (pre-
determined amount of aggregate, mineral
filler, additive, water, and bitumen emulsion) to
the mixing chamber. Tables 6.8 and 6.9 gives the specification requirements for slurry seals
and properties of aggregates to be used
in slury seal and Table 6.10 described mix design
criterion for slurry seal mix. The details of slurry seal application and construction procedure
are given in IRC:SP:81.

Microsurfacing
6.8.1
Introduction
The Microsurfacing shall consist of mixture of modified (Polymer or Rubber Latex) bitumen
emulsion, well graded mineral aggregate, water, filler and additive
(if needed) proportioned,
mixed and uniformly spread over a properly prepared surface. The finally laid microsurfacing
shall have a homogeneous mat, adhere firmly to the prepared surface and provide friction
resistant surface texture throughout
its service
life. The mix
is to be a quick setting system
i.e.
it should be able to receive traffic after a short period of time preferably within about one
hours of its laying depending upon weather conditions.
It is applied on an existing pavement surface which
is structurally sound but is showing the
signs of functional distress such as loss
riding
quality, cracking and
polishing.
Generally,
microsurfacing
is laid
in single layer, but when the existing surface
is highly polished and/
or cracked,
it is advisable to apply
it in two or more layers. Microsurfacing can be used for
surface treatment on roads, taxi ways and runways. Normally two layers of microsurfacing
are advisable on cement concrete surface.
As a surface treatment, micro-surfacing imparts protection to the underlying pavement and
provides renewed surface. Special emulsifiers in micro-surfacing emulsions contribute to the
quick setting characteristics. Minor re-profiling can be achieved with multiple applications.
Special equipment permits the filling of wheel ruts up to 40 mm deep in one pass.

Benefits of microsurfacing
The major benefits of microsurfacing technology are given as under:
>
Quick application (One lane- km in 35 minutes)
>
Minimum traffic hold up (work is done in lane wise manner) quick opening to
traffic
>
Life span exceeds the
life span of ordinary Bituminous Concrete
>
Non-polluting for environment since no heating or hot paving
is required
>
Does not require sensor paver or compaction equipments
>
Longer life since oxidation
is reduced
>
Waterproof Surface - Protection from rains
>
Ideal
for surface sealing treatment since
it improves skid
resistance and
provides surface durability
>
Does
not increase pavement height
significantly
(This saves from water
logging, drainage and other associated problems)
>
Cost effective as compared to Hot-Mix (Almost 40% saving in Cost)
>
Reduces noise caused by movement of traffic
>
Environment friendly (reduced emissions)
>
No change in road furniture or drainage
>
Savings in natural resources
Microsurfacing
helps
in
preservation
of pavement strength and can be used
both as a
preventive maintenance treatment or and periodic renewal treatment on a preferably low,
medium or heavy
traffic.
It can be used for pavements
in urban and
rural areas, primary
and inter-state routes, residential streets, highways, and
toll roads.
It can also be used on
the top of single coat surface dressing (Cape Seal), on open graded premix carpet without
seal coat and also on Dense Bituminous Macadam/Bituminous Macadam. Various types of
microsurfacing that can be used for different applications; quantity of microsurfacing mix and
the residual binder content in each type are presented
in Table 6.11.

mixes shall be prepared and laid for the designed mix and observed for breaking time and

content. Procedure for calibration of microsurfacing machine is given in Appendix-8.
Details of Microsurfacing application are given in IRC:SP:81
.
6.9
Cape Seal
Cape seal involves application of a slurry seal or micro-surfacing to a newly-constructed
single coat surface dressing treatment. The slurry or microsurfacing application helps to
fill the voids between the chips. Cape seals provide highly durable surface treatment. The
slurry or microsurfacing bonds the chips to prevent loss of the chips due to traffic abrasion.
For a successful cape seal,
it is important to have single coat surface treatment with lower
residual bitumen content than a traditional chip seal. The most critical element to avoid
in a
cape seal
is an excess of slurry that eliminates the desired knobby surface texture. Curing
time of four to ten days should be allowed between placement of the broomed surface after
surface dressing and before application of slurry seal or microsurfacing to remove loose
cover material or other foreign material that would prevent adherence. Table 6.16 gives
quantities of bitumen emulsion and aggregates required to execute a cape seal. For surface
dressing RS-2 emulsion shall be used. For slurry seal SS-2 grade emulsion shall be used.
Polymer modified emulsion shall be used
if microsurfacing is used as top layer.

7 COLD MIXES
A cold mix is defined as a mixture of bitumen emulsion and aggregate that is mixed together
at ambient temperature. Bitumen emulsion being
liquid
at room temperature, there
is no
need to heat or dry the mineral aggregate. Cold mix
is useful
in the areas, where there
is
long distance between the job site and plant and temperature of climate is low and moderate
(<40°C). Further, the versatility of cold mix allows
it to be mixed in-place at the job site as well
as at a plant site and then subsequently transported to the job site. Cold mix may be used
in bituminous base (BM), binder course (BM/SDBC) as well as wearing course (SDBC) of
41

IRC:SP:100-2014
flexible pavement. These mixes may be designed for a broad range of bitumen emulsions,
aggregates,
field
conditions and
tailored
to
specific performance
requirement. The
cold
mix should be designed to meet the performance requirements which include workability,
coating, strength development, and other applicable targets. The quality of residual bitumen,
aggregate, and climatic conditions should be taken into account.
The important elements for design of an acceptable cold mix are described below:
a)
Coating
: The emulsion should have ability to coat the aggregate effectively
without balling of fines. Sometimes, the quality of emulsion, mixing water and
aggregate may also influence the coating.
b)
Workability
: The mixture must maintain
its workability during production,
laying and storage (in case of stockpiled mixes) prior to its application.
c)
Run-off : The design should ensure that emulsion run-off from mixture will
not occur. For open graded mixes,
it
is important that emulsion does not
drain down through the voids in aggregate.
d)
Aggregates quality
: The sand equivalent value test shall be carried out to
ensure that clay content
is not
in excess. A sand equivalent value (as per
IS:2720) of 50 and above
is preferred.
e)
Bitumen content
: The amount of residual bitumen required
in the mix
is
determined based on the surface area of the aggregate and typically varies
between 4 to 6 percent residual bitumen by weight of dry aggregate depending
upon gradation selected.
f)
Moisture susceptibility
: For moisture susceptibility of the mix to intrusion
of water, boiling or immersion tests may be used in conjunction with coating
by visual observations.
g)
Strength
: Progressive strength gain can be determined
using
Marshall
Stability
Test. Minimum
strength
requirements
will be
set by the design
criteria depending upon the type of mixture (open graded/dense graded).
This section deals with the different types of cold mixes which may be used for construction
and maintenance of roads.
7.1
Cold Mixed Bituminous IVIacadam (CMBM)
Bituminous Macadam (BM)
is an open graded bituminous mixture suitable for moderate
traffic roads used for construction of bituminous base course as well as for strengthening
of flexible pavements. Cold Mixed Bituminous Macadam (CMBM) shall involve construction
of one or more courses of compacted mixture prepared with bitumen emulsion and mineral
aggregate,
laid immediately after mixing to required grade and camber using appropriate
machinery.

Properties of materials
The aggregates shall consist of crushed stone, crushed slag, crushed gravel (shingle) or
other suitable. The aggregates shall be clean, strong, durable and fairly cubical, free from
clay and disintegrated pieces, organic and other deleterious matter. The coarse aggregates
shall be crushed material retained on 2.36 mm IS sieve while fine aggregates shall be fraction
passing, 2.36 mm sieve and retained on 75 micron sieve. The aggregate shall satisfy the

Quantities of materials
The approximate quantity of mineral aggregates required for 50 mm compacted thickness

other suitable grade) required for premixing of bituminous Macadam shall be added at the
rate specified rate depending on the gradation of aggregates after adding premixing water
(1
to 3 percent). The quantity of emulsion may be slightly higher for an absorptive type of
aggregates (water absorption exceeding 2 percent). RS-1 grade shall be applied for tack
coat @ 3.0 kg/1 0 m^ on primed Water Bound Macadam (WBM) or Wet Mix Macadam (WMM)
surface.
In case, CMBM
is to be laid over the existing bituminous surface, the tack coat of
RS-1 grade shall be applied @ 2.5 kg/10 m^ area which should also meet the requirement of
bond strength, as determined by the method given

7.1.4
Construction of CMBM
CMBM shall not be laid during raining or when the granular base course is wet or when the
atmospheric temperature in the shade
is below 8°C. All equipment necessary for the proper
construction work shall be available at the work site
in good working condition. Adequate
provisions for safe movement of vehicular traffic shall be made
in advance. The underlying
surface on which CMBM is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned to a uniform
grade and camber. Depressions, ruts or potholes shall be repaired in advance at least before
the day of laying. The surface of underlying course shall be thoroughly swept, made clean
free from the dust and foreign materials.
If the existing base
is extremely uneven, a profile
correction course may be considered. The tack coat with emulsion shall be applied not earlier
than 10 minutes before laying the cold mix.
It
is imperative to prepare cold mix of proper and uniform quality by using a cold mix plant
or a modified hot mix plant switching
off the heating. The production of high quality cold
mixes requires a well-controlled operation. The set up for a central cold mix plant may vary
depending on the quality required and the type of mix.
It
is recommended that the plant
shall have (1) a twin shaft pug
mill, (2) a tank for emulsion storage, (3) metered pumps for
emulsion transfer to pug mill and water, valves and spray bars, (4) aggregate feeder bins, (5)
conveyor belts for moving aggregate and mix, and (6) a power source. The pug mill should
allow a variation
in the mixing time to ensure proper coating of aggregate with emulsion.
The use of a surge bin or storage silo
is desirable for continuous mixing and improved mix
uniformity. Batch type pug mills can be used but the production of cold mixes is ideally suited
for continuous type mixers. The ingredients shall be mixed for about one minute to achieve
the uniform coating of bitumen on mineral aggregates. Excessive mixing may un-coat the
aggregates.
For plant produced cold mixes, the paving procedures are similar to those used
for hot
bituminous mixes. The self-propelled pavers are recommended. Cold mixes are generally
stiffer than hot mixes or not as workable as hot mixed materials, with open-graded mixture
being the most difficult to place. Proper paver operation
is thus very critical for obtaining a
uniform and smooth mat. This includes keeping the paver speed as constant as possible and
the level of mix on the augers at a nearly constant depth.
If the mix sticks to paver screed or
tearing of the mat occurs, a change in the mixing time or the water content should be effected
which would eliminate the problem. The screed should not be heated.
For an open-graded mix
like the CMBM, the breaking of bitumen emulsion usually occurs
quickly. With open-graded mixes, rolling may normally begin immediately behind the paver.
Vibratory rolling for open-graded mixes
is not recommended because fracture of aggregate
and bitumen debonding may occur. A light "choke" or "blotter" of a coarse sand or fine crusher
screenings may be applied after steel-wheeled
rolling. The choke or blotter permits rolling
with a pneumatic-tired roller and prevents pick-up of mix and damage of compacted cold mix
layer by the traffic. Properly designed uniformly cold mix shall be discharged to the tippers
for transportation to site. The spreading of cold mix will be done preferably by means of a self
propelled mechanical paver at a suitable speed capable of spreading, tamping and finishing
45



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
to the proper grade, line and cross-section. The mix shall be spread
in such a manner that,
after compaction, the required thickness of surfacing layer is achieved. The paver laid cold
mix, after becoming black from original brown colour due to breaking of emulsion on surface
of aggregate, shall be thoroughly and uniformly compacted by a set of rollers at a speed not
more than 5 km per hour. The break down rolling shall be done with 8-12 tonne three wheel
steel roller and the final rolling shall be done with 8 to
1 0 tonne tandem roller. Before finishing
rolling by tandem
roller, break down
rolling shall preferably be followed by an intermediate
rolling with smooth wheel pneumatic roller of 15 to 30 tonne capacity having a tyre pressure
of 7 kg/cm^ The wheels of the
roller shall be kept moist to prevent the picking up of mix.
Rolling shall commence longitudinally from edges and progress towards the centre except on
super elevated portions, where
it shall progress from lower to the upper edge. Rolling shall
be continued
till the specified density
is achieved and
all roller marks are eliminated. Traffic
shall be allowed after 2-3 hours, when the cold mix
is well set and
is not picked up by the
vehicles.
Adequate quality control at every stage of the work
is essential. Therefore, field laboratory
must be set up. Periodic sieve analysis of each type of mineral aggregate shall be done to
ensure that the gradation of aggregate follows close to the original gradation of designed
job mix. The number of samples to be taken per day would depend upon the bulk supply of
aggregates made
in a day at the plant site. The characteristics of mineral aggregate shall
be determined at the rate of one test for every 100 m^ of aggregates. Periodic checks of
the properties of emulsion such as residue content, viscosity and residue on 600 micron IS
sieve shall be done
in field,
in accordance to 15:8887-2004. At least one sample for every
1 00 tonnes of cold mix discharged at the pug mill chute or a minimum of one sample per plant
per day shall be collected and various tests shall be carried out. These specimens shall be
tested for density. Residual bitumen shall be extracted from mix after curing and emulsion
shall be determined.
For the compacted surface of every 700 m^ or less, one field density test shall be conducted
to determine the density of mix as laid and compacted. The density shall not be less than
95 percent of the maximum laboratory density. The longitudinal profile of the finished surface
shall be tested by 3 m straight edge, parallel to the centre line, and the transverse profile by
a camber template. Any irregularity greater than 6 mm shall be corrected.

Cold Mixed Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (CIVISDBC)
Semi dense bituminous concrete (SDBC)

as binder course or wearing course in a flexible pavement. This section deals with the design

Coarse aggregate shall be the fraction retained on 2.36 mm sieve and fine aggregates shall
be the fraction passing 2.36 mm sieve and retained on 75 micron sieve. These shall consist
of crushed screenings, natural sand or a mixture of both and shall be clean, hard, durable,
uncoated and free from injurious, clay, soft or flaky pieces, organic or deleterious matter. The
aggregate shall satisfy physical requirements given
in Table 7.1. The shelf
life of bitumen
emulsion shall be such that
it meets the physical requirements, as given in earlier Table 3.2,
at the time of its use. The dates of manufacture and expiry shall be clearly indicated on the
drums.
7.2.2
Design of CMSDBC
Design criteria for CMSDBC is given in Table 7.5. The laboratory mix design gives proportions
of different mineral aggregates
in terms of individual sieve size, for the purpose of actual
construction
in the
field. Blending of two or more sizes of aggregates (each size having
within
it a range of individual sieve sizes) would be necessary. The blending ratio is obtained
on a weight basis, giving the percent weight of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and
filler
needed to give the ultimate gradation based on
unit weight or bulk density of aggregates
supplied. The mineral aggregate
in combination with the optimum premixing water content
and bitumen emulsion
content, as determined
in the
laboratory,
constitutes the job mix
formula for implementation during the construction. The cold mix design shall be worked out
based on a correct and truly representative sample of materials that will actually be used in
the given construction project. The detailed procedure evolved for mix design of CMSDBC
using cationic bitumen emulsion,
is given in Appendix-9.

Precautions in laying of cold mixes (BM and SDBC)
^
Following precautions should be taken
to ensure successful
laying of cold mixes and
to
achieve good performance
•
Cold mixes generally have good resistance to detrimental effects of water
damage during construction. However,
if rain occurs before the mixture
is
cured,
traffic should be kept
off,
until the mix
is cured and the necessary
compaction
is accomplished.
•
The mixing water content should be just sufficient required to adequately
disperse the emulsion and achieve good workability
•
Mixtures should be mixed only enough to properly disperse the emulsion.
Excessive mixing may cause the emulsion to break prematurely or strip from
the mineral aggregates
•
For faster curing, place the cold mix
in several thin layers rather than
in a
single thick layer.
•
If case raveling observed due to traffic, the loose material should be broomed
off as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the surface.
If the
raveling continues, the surface should be fog sealed with a light application
of a slow-setting emulsion diluted with soft water in
1 :1
ratio.
7.3
Bituminous Cold Mixes (Including Gravel Emulsion)
This includes providing cold mix consisting of mixture of unheated mineral aggregate and
bitumen emulsion,
laid
in a
single
layer of 25-75 mm.

8 HALF WARM MIXES
Half warm mixes are those mixes in which the bituminous binder is either a bitumen emulsion
or foamed bitumen, which
is mixed with warm aggregates (100 ± 10°C), laid and compacted
at temperature between 80-90°C.
Half warm mixes are considered as low energy mixes, which can be used for construction
and maintenance of bituminous courses for all climatic and traffic conditions. The production
of a
half warm mix using bitumen emulsion as the binder
is comparable to production of
hot mix using hot and melted paving bitumen. However, the mixing time
is less
in case of
half warm mix and the plant operating temperatures are also lower. The prime advantages
of producing half warm mixes (DBM, SDBC and BC) using warm aggregate and cationic
bitumen emulsions are as under:
>
Reduced mixing time
>
Ability to coat large size aggregate at lower temperature
>
Reduction of bitumen hardening during mixing
8.1
Materials for Half Warm Mixes
The half warm mixed dense bituminous macadam, semi-dense or dense bituminous concrete
shall consist of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and filler in suitable proportion mixed with
sufficient quantity of cationic bitumen emulsion. Representative samples of the aggregates
proposed to be used for the specific job shall be tested in the laboratory and a proper blend
of the aggregate shall be worked out so that the gradation of final aggregate mix will satisfy
specified aggregate gradations, of DBM, SDBC and BC.
Half warm mixes shall consist of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and filler (Conforming the
requirement given in Table 7.1 ). The bitumen emulsion shall be cationic SS-2 grade confirming
to IS:8887 specification or a tailor made for the aggregate to be used
in construction. The
requirements of bitumen emulsion are given Table 3.2 (Section
3). Design of half warm
aggregate based mix prepared with bitumen emulsion shall be done by Marshall Method.
The design criteria is given in Table 8.1.

8.2
Preparation of Mixture
The mixing plant may be either a batch or drum mix plant. Incase of batch plants, the pug
mill mixing chamber should be vented to allow for the steam to escape. The discharge end
of the bitumen emulsion circulating pipe should be kept below the surface of the emulsion
in the storage tank to prevent foaming. The bitumen transfer system must allow turning
off or reducing
the heat on
all
lines, pumps and jacketed bitumen weigh
buckets. The
temperature of the emulsion should never reach 90°C and
it should be kept about 75 to
85°C. The minimum mixing time needs to be established and shall be based on the amount
of coating of aggregate particles as determined by ASTM D 2489, "Test for Degree of Particle
Coating of Bituminous-Aggregate Mixture". The minimum acceptable percentage of coated
particles will vary with aggregate gradation, particle shape, surface texture, bitumen content
and use of the warm or hot mixed material. Warm bitumen emulsion mixes are produced
at a temperature between 80 to 85°C. The temperature of aggregate
is kept
in between
95 to 105°C.
8.3
Construction Procedure
Procedure for construction shall be same as for cold mixes. Warm or hot emulsion mixes
typically are spread with a
self-propelled sensor paver.
For warm emulsion
mixtures,
a
minimum delay should occur between discharge from the mixing plant and placement of
mixture to prevent
it from becoming stiff and difficult to spread. However, some warm emulsion
mixtures, produced with emulsions having very soft bitumen residue and a small quantity of
solvent, may be stockpiled and placed cold. For warm emulsion mixes, compaction should
begin when the mix will support the roller without shoving. For warm mixes, the breakdown
rolling can be completed with a self-propelled pneumatic or double drum (tandem) vibratory
roller followed by finish rolling with a steel wheeled roller.
8.4
Quality Control
The details of quality control may be referred to Annexure-ll.
9 MAINTENANCE MIXTURES USING BITUMEN EMULSION
9.1
Introduction
Maintenance
is essential for upkeep of the road. The most time consuming and neglected
maintenance activities include patching, filling potholes and repair of other failed local areas
of the pavement.
It
is well known that the use of, hot mix
is preferred for patch work. The
quality hot mix is not available throughout the year at many locations like areas of cold climate
and high rainfall. Therefore, patching may be accomplished using cold mixes. Maintenance
mixes consist of the following types:
1)
Mixes for Immediate Use
2)
Storable Mixes
3)
Maintenance mixes using RAP
4)
Ready Made Mixes
50

IRC:SP:100-2014
9.2
Maintenance Mixes for Immediate Use
Such emulsion-aggregate mixes can be mixed
in a pug
mill
or
in a concrete mixer and
transported to the site where these are to be used. The heating of the aggregate
is normally
not necessary.
In cold weather conditions, warm aggregates and emulsions heated upto
50 to 85°C can be used for better workability. Precautions to be taken during heating of
emulsion are given
in Section 2.8. Procedure for preparation of mix for immediate use and
storable mixes is given in Appendix-10.
The bitumen emulsions recommended for patching mixes are MS, SS-2 grades or tailor-
made. Aggregates should meet the requirements specified
previously
in Section
4. The
aggregate gradation recommended is given in Table 9.1. Bitumen emulsion containing small
amounts of solvents generally produces the acceptable patching mixes for immediate use.

The quantity of emulsion shall be 7 to 8 percent by weight of aggregate.
9.3
Storable Maintenance Mixes
During the cold weather and rainy months, most of the maintenance mixes used are those
which may be stored/stockpiled, which can be produced
in
late summer or early months
of winter, transported and stored for later use. Such mixes are usable for periods up to six
months and are workable without the use of heat. These must be covered by polythene or
tarpoline. The production of stockpile maintenance mix
is simple and includes a pug
mill
type mixer. Slow setting (SS-2) grade or tailor made emulsion
is to be used for this purpose.
The aggregate gradation for stockpile mixes
is same as given
in Table 9.1. The duly mixed
material shall be stored
in a clean, covered area to prevent contamination and not stored
in
a low area or depression where water could get into the mix. For prolonged stockpiling and
to be usable at lower temperatures, a high float medium setting emulsion
is recommended.
These mixes may contain residual bitumen
in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 percent depending on
gradation and surface characteristics of aggregates.
9.4
Maintenance Mixes Using RAP (MMRAP)
Many bitumen pavement overlay projects include cold milling of bituminous surface and can
produce large quantities of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). There are a number of uses
for RAP in pavements application, and an increasing one is to use
it in maintenance mix.
51



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
It
is recommended that, when possible, cold milling be used which produces RAP material
in small pieces so that
it would not require further crushing. Bitumen emulsion
is usually
incorporated to the RAP by plant mixing. Special emulsion formulations have been developed
for preparing RAP maintenance mixes, since softening of the aged RAP asphalt binder
is
desired. Emulsion contents in the range of 1 .5 to 2.5 percent by dry weight of RAP are typical
for these mixes. RAP maintenance mixes are stored
in stockpiles and their handling
is very
similar to traditional emulsion maintenance mixes. Normally extra slow SS-2 emulsion with
more solvent is useful. These mixes may be used successfully for both thin and deep patching
including potholes repair.
In area where coarse, crushed aggregates are not available, the
use of RAP usually results
in superior maintenance mixes to those produced from
local
aggregates.
9.5
Readymade Maintenance Mixes
Ready to use proprietary cold mix patching materials are also effective for instant repair
of potholes on roads under inclement weather and operating conditions. These mixes are
expected to contain 5 to 6 percent of residual bitumen and continuously graded aggregates.
A typical grading for such mixes
is given
in Table 9.1. Such mixes can be stored upto six
months from date of manufacture.
9.6
Quality of Maintenance Mixes
The following tests shall be carried out for assessment of the quality of maintenance mixes.
Test procedures are given
in Appendics 11 to 13. The procedure for carrying out the bond
test is given in Appendix-1.

Procedure for Repair of Potholes Using Maintenance Mixes
9.7.1
Preparation of potholes
Pothole shall be cleaned of loose material and dust with a
stiff wire brush. Pothole need
not be dry. However, excess water,
if any in the pothole, shall be removed. A tack coat shall
be applied
to WMM/granular surface before placing the mix to ensure good bond
at the
bottom.
9.7.2
Placing mix in potlioles
The mix is intended for filling potholes up to 75 mm deep. For deeper potholes (more than 75
mm), patching mix shall be placed and compacted in 2 or more layers of 25 to 75 mm. Initially
the pothole may be
filled using Crusher Run Macadam (CRM) conforming to the grading
given in Table 9.2.

Compaction of the mixes
First the outside edge or periphery of the patch shall be compacted with a hand rammer and
then compaction shall proceed inwards. To prevent initial pick up of the loose mix by the hand
rammer either continue to wet the hand rammer with water or place empty plastic lined bags
on the loose mix. For deep potholes, place the patching mix and compact
in 75 mm thick
layers. After compaction, the compacted patch shall be about 10 mm higher than the existing
road surface to allow for further compaction by traffic.
If there are numerous closely spaced
patches,
it is preferred to use a small roller rather than a hand rammer.
If a roller is used, the
compacted patch shall be about 3 mm higher than the existing road surface.
Before opening the compacted patch
to
traffic,
sufficient amount of clean sand
shall be
sprinkled on the patch to prevent pick up by traffic. The quality control shall be done as per
Annexure-ll.
10 COLD RECYCLING USING BITUMEN EMULSION
10.1
Introduction
Recycling
is
defined
as
"the
process
involving
the
reuse
of
material
that already has
performed
its first-intended
use".
In
relation
to bituminous pavement recycling, there are
several methods available. Therefore, projects being considered for recycling of pavement
must be carefully evaluated to decide the most appropriate recycling technique. The factors to
be considered should include (1) existing pavement condition (2) existing pavement material
quality, specifications and layer thickness (3) structural integrity of pavement (4) availability
of recycling additive and
(5) recycling machinery. The Asphalt Recycling and Reclaiming
Association (ARRA) recognized five types of recycling for bituminous pavements:
a)
Cold Planning
: The bituminous pavement is removed to a specified depth
and the surface is restored to a desired grade and camber. Surface shall be
free of humps, ruts and other surface irregularities. The milling of pavement
is done with a suitable self-propelled rotary drum and cold planning machine.
The Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) materials are then transferred to
tippers for transportation to site of work.
53



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
b)
Hot Recycling
: RAP
is combined with virgins aggregates, bitumen and
recycling agent to produce a usable bituminous mix. Although batch type hot
mix plants are used, drum mix plants may also be used to produce the mix
containing RAP. Most of the RAP
is produced by cold planning, milling and
crushing. The mix placement, compacting equipments and procedures are
same as used hot mix bituminous construction.
c)
Hot In-Place Recycling
: This type of recycling
is performed
on-site;
in-
place. The aged pavement
is typically reworked to a depth
in the range of
20 to 40 mm. The bituminous pavement is heated, softened and scarified. A
bitumen emulsion or other suitable recycling agent is added. The three hot
in-place recycling methods are defined as heater-scarification, repaving and
remixing.
d)
Cold Recycling
: The cold recycling is performed using the central or mobile
plant. The most commonly used method
is cold
in- place recycling.
In this
type of recycling, the depth of pavement may be
in the range of 50 to 100
mm. The pavement is pulverized and the reclaimed material
is mixed with a
bitumen emulsion or emulsified recycling agent, spread and compacted to
produce a base course layer. Cold recycled base requires a fresh bituminous
surface over
it. The pavements with less traffic may use a bitumen emulsion
for surface treatment. Higher traffic pavements may use a modified bitumen
emulsion or a surface treatment of hot bituminous mix.
e)
Full-Depth Reclamation
:
In
this category,
all of the pavement sections,
and
in some cases, a predetermined amount of underlying
material, are
mixed with bitumen emulsion to produce a stabilized base course. Full depth
reclamation consists of six basic steps such as pulverization, additive and/or
emulsion incorporation, spreading, compacting, shaping, and placement of
new bituminous surface.
10.2
RAP Material for Cold Recycling
The term 'RAP' is given to bituminous material that is recovered from an old existing pavement.
There are two ways that RAP material can be used in road construction:
a)
In-situ Treatment
: The
existing
bituminous mix can be
reclaimed and
simultaneously
treated
using
'cold
in-place
recycling"
technology
(also
referred
to as CIR or
partial depth
recycling). This process uses a large
truck-mounted recycler to recover the upper portion of bituminous layer of
the existing pavement (normally between 100 mm to 150 mm depth) and
simultaneously RAP in mixed with additives.
b)
In Plant Treatment
: The milled bituminous mixture is stockpiled locally and
treated in a suitable mixing plant. The treated RAP material is then returned to
site and paved back in the areas that were milled. The "cold in plant recycling"
technology introduces flexibility into the recycling process by separating the
54



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
recovery and reuse operations.
In
addition, wliere
required,
tliis process
provides the opportunity to crush and/or screen RAP material, as well as
blend
it with fresh aggregate (eg., graded crushed stone),
if required, before
it is recycled.
The quality of RAP is most important. From a cold recycling perspective,
it is
most important to know whether the bitumen in the RAP material is "Active or
Inactive". RAP maybe a "Black Aggregate" (Inactive) with properties similar
to those of graded crushed stone or
it may be a "Sticky Material" (Active) with
inherent cohesiveness due to the less
brittle bitumen
in the RAP material.
This
is important since the state of the binder in RAP will have a significant
influence on how the recycled material will behave when
it is reused.
The following observations will indicate inactive RAP:
a)
Visual appearance
: The RAP is dull grey in colour with no black shining
surfaces.
b)
Brittleness
: A chunk of RAP breaks cleanly into pieces.
c)
Adhesion
: Pieces of RAP (at ambient temperature) do not stick to the
hand, when a sample is firmly squeezed.
In case, there
is a doubt as to whether or not the RAP can be classified as
Active or Inactive, a representative sample may be tested
in a laboratory to
determine following properties:
a)
The amount of bitumen in the RAP material (percentage by mass),
b)
Rheological properties of the recovered bitumen (Penetration, Softening
Point, Shear Modulus and Viscosity).
c)
Chemical composition of bitumen (asphaltenes, aromatics, resins and
saturates)
10.3
Cold Recycling
The cold recycling process has numerous applications for maintenance and rehabilitation of
old bituminous pavements. However, each application will be a project specific. The following
three factors are considered responsible to decide process of recycling:
>
The type of pavement and the distress that needs to be addressed
>
The quality of material in existing pavement
>
The service life expectations after recycling
The materials involved with the cold recycling process can be classified in to two types:
>
100 percent Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material, where the depth
of recycling is restricted to bituminous layers
>
Blend of RAP and Granular material, where the recycling depth includes
granular
layers
also. Such RAP
includes
bituminous
materials,
crushed
stone and natural gravels, as well as materials previously stabilized.

10.4
Recycling Using Bitumen Emulsion
The use of bitumen emulsions as binder in cold recycling and full depth reclamation process
is well known. The essential part for selection of a bituminous pavement rehabilitation method
is the determination of the existing pavement condition. The type and area of pavement
surface defects need to be scientifically evaluated. The strength of the current pavement
structure and
its material needs are to be examined. The current and future traffic needs
must be investigated. The steps and methods for evaluation of pavement materials for cold
recycling
is given in Table 10.1.

For cold
recycling,
a solvent or "Abson
Recovery (ASTM D472 and 1856)" method may be adopted which includes to determine
the bitumen properties, Chemical Composition (asphaltenes, resins, saturates and paraffins)
Penetration as 25°C, Absolute Viscosity at 60°C. For aggregate bases and sub grade soils,
a wet sieve analysis and sand equivalent value or plasticity index are necessary done. A
mixture design
is required to determine the type, grade and amount of bitumen emulsion
to be added
in mixture. The premixing water content, the stability and strength (modulus)
properties of the recycled mixture tests are needed to be investigated.
10.5
Mix Design Procedure
Considering the number of variables that need to be addressed and the amount of material
required to study these variables, the mix design procedure involves several steps depending
on the magnitude of design traffic and life. The mix design procedure always begin with testing
of the material to be stabilized (preliminary tests) to determine whether it is suitable for treating
56



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
with bitumen emulsion and,
if not, the type of pre-treatment required to make
it suitable.
Once the suitability of the material has been proven, the actual mix design procedure begin
those provides an indication of the application rate of bitumen emulsion and filler (if necessary)
required to achieve the class of mix. Thereafter, depending on the design traffic (structural
capacity requirement), additional tests are undertaken to refine the application rate of bitumen
emulsion and gain confidence in the performance potential of the treated material. Procedure
described in Asphalt Academy (May 2009) Technical guideline
: Bitumen Stabilized Material.
A guideline for design and construction of bitumen emulsion and foam bitumen stabilized
material (TG-2) may be used for mix design.
In summary, the mix design procedure consists
of following steps.
a)
Preliminary Tests
: These include standard laboratory tests to determine
the grading, moisture, density relationships and Atterberg
limits, where the
results indicate that some form of pre-treatment is required, additional tests
must be undertaken
after such pre-treatment
to ensure that the desired
benefits were achieved.
b)
Level
1 Mix Design
: Level
1
Mix design begin with the preparation
of
samples that will be used to prepare the specimens required for all levels of
mix design. 100 mm diameter Marshall Specimens (Marshall Specimen) are
prepared and cured for Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) testing.Test results are
used to:
>
Identify the preferred stabilizing agent
>
Indicate the target bitumen content
>
Identify the need for filler.
Level
1
mix design
is
sufficient for
lighter and medium
traffic roads with
a
limited
structural
capacity
of
5
msa. Where
the
structural
capacity
requirements exceed 5 msa, the mix design procedures described as Levels
2 and 3 should be undertaken.
c)
Level 2 Mix Design
: This procedure uses 150 mm diameter by 127 mm
higth specimens (Proctor specimens) prepared using vibratory compaction,
cured
at the equilibrium
moisture content and tested
for
Indirect Tensile
Strength. This level
is recommended for roads carrying traffic up to 10 msa.
Test results are used to:
>
Optimize the required bitunrien content
>
Obtain ITS values for increased confidence
d)
Level 3 Mix Design
: This procedure uses
triaxial
testing on
150 mm
diameter by 300 mm high specimens for a higher level of confidence. This
level is recommended for design traffic exceeding 10 msa.
e)
Materials Selection Criteria
: The guidelines are given below:
i)
The PI of material to be treated with bitumen emulsion should be less
than 8.
57



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
ii)
Bitumen emulsion must coat coarse particles, not only the fines.
iii)
Fines content of 2 percent is sufficient.
iv)
Material at a temperature of 1 5°C or higher can be treated with bitumen
emulsion
v)
The selection of the correct grade or category of bitumen emulsion for
each application
is essential
These are listed below:
i)
Slow set cationic bitumen emulsions are exclusively used worldwide. These
bitumen emulsions
or tailormade emulsions having
longer workability
to
ensure good dispersion and are formulated for needed mix stability.
ii)
A number of developments
in bitumen emulsion technology are happened
to improve stability without prolonging the breaking time. These emulsions
are typically slower setting than the traditional SS products, and should be
used on projects where the treated layer can be cured for a shorter period
before opening to traffic. During the mix design, and on site before full-scale
application begins, the breaking rate should be tested with representative
samples of material, active filler, water at realistic temperatures.
iii)
The selection of the bitumen emulsion type and grade
is influenced by the
type of material and climatic condition that is to be treated. Certain material
types are not suitable for treatment with anionic bitumen emulsions. These
are the acidic rocks with silica contents above 65 percent and alkali contents
below 35 percent such a quartzite, granite, rhyolite, sandstone, syenite and
felsites. Treatment of such materials requires a cationic bitumen emulsion.
iv)
Manufacturers normally recommend that undiluted bitumen emulsion may
be heated to 50 and 60°C to prevent premature breaking due to the increase
in pressure and shearing action while pumping and
injecting through the
spray bar on the recycler.
v)
The pH
levels of the water must be checked
for the compatibility of the
bitumen emulsion and the water.
vi)
Breaking
is the separation
of the bitumen from the water phase through
flocculation and the coalescence of the bitumen droplets to produce films
of bitumen on the individual particles of the material. The rate at which the
bitumen droplets separate from the water phase is referred to as the breaking
time.
vii)
The
breaking
process
with
anionic bitumen emulsions
is
a
mechanical
process
(evaporation),
whereas
cationic
bitumen
emulsions
produce
a
chemical break. For dense mixtures, more time is needed to allow for mixing
and placement besides slower breaking times. As the bitumen emulsion
breaks,
the
colour changes from brown
to
black. Although
this can be
observed with the naked eye,
it
is recommended that a magnifying glass
may also be used.

IRC:SP:100-2014
viii)
Curing
is the displacement of water and the resultant increase
in stiffness
and tensile strength of the mix. This is important as a mix needs to develop
sufficient stiffness and cohesion between particles before traffic is opened.
ix)
Rate of absorption
of water by such
materials
is also important. Rough-
textured and
porous
materials reduce
the
breaking and
setting
time
of
emulsion mix by absorbing water contained in the bitumen emulsion.
x)
Moisture content of the mix prior to mixing influences breaking time. While
moisture content of the mix after compaction influences curing rate.
xi)
Grading of the material and voids content of the mix also influence setting
process.
xii)
Type, grade and quantity of the bitumen emulsion also influence
setting
process.
xiii)
Mineral composition of the material play a vital role. The rate of cure may be
affected by physico- chemical interactions between the bitumen emulsion
and the surface of the individual material particles.
xiv)
Quantum of electrical charge on the material particles in relation to that of the
bitumen emulsion also influence breaking as well as setting.
xv)
Active filler addition, the amount of cement or lime also influence setting.
xvi)
Temperature of material and
air: The higher temperature, the quicker the
bitumen emulsion breaks and cures.
xvii) A minimum of
1 to 2 percent moisture is required in the mineral material prior
to adding the bitumen emulsion.

spraying bitumen emulsion for small areas. These sprayers are available
in different sizes
(25 liters to 500 liters) capacity. A picture of hand operated sprayers and mechanized bitumen
emulsion sprayers are given in Photo 11.1.

Pressure Distributors
'
The bitumen emulsion distributor is the most important equipment used in tack coat, prime coat
and other surface treatments (Photo 11 .2).
It is used to uniformly apply the bitumen emulsion
over the surface at the specified
rate. The distributor consists of either a truck-mounted or
trailer-mounted insulated tank with controls to set the bitumen emulsion application rates. A
spray bar equipped with nozzles through which the bitumen emulsion forced under pressure
onto the pavement surface
is placed at the end of tank. Spray bars can cover widths of 3
to 9 m
in a single pass, depending on the pump capacity. A hand sprayer may be used to
apply the emulsion to areas that cannot be reached with the spray bar. The distributor tank-
typically has a capacity of 3,000 to 20,000 liters. The tank shall contain a circulating system.
Pressure generated when a non circulating or not bypassed spray bar is shut off can cause
the emulsion to break and plug the unit with bitumen. The tank
is also equipped with one
or more heaters used to bring the bitumen emulsion to the desired spraying temperature.
Extreme care
is required when using these heaters while emulsion
is used as
material.
Premature breaking of the emulsion may occur,
if heating temperature
is too high (>70°C)
and heaters are to be used, the emulsion should remain circulating while heat is applied and
excessive temperatures should not be allowed. Two extremely important adjustments are
the spray nozzle angle setting and spray bar height. The angle of the nozzle openings must
be adjusted so that the spray showers will not interfere with each other. The recommended
angle, measured from the spray bar axis,
is from
15 to 30 degrees. To ensure a uniform
spread, the spray bar must be set and maintained at the proper height above the pavement
surface.
If
it
is set too
high,
distortion of spray fans may occur. The best results usually
are achieved with an exact double coverage, but triple coverage can sometimes be used
with spray bars with 100 mm nozzle spacing.
Fig. 11.1
illustrates the heights of the spray
bar necessary to achieve these coverage. Three controls are standard equipment on most
distributors. One
is a valve system that governs the flow of bitumen emulsion. Another is a
pressure gauge that registers pump output. The third is a bitumen emulsion with an odometer
that indicates the number of meters per minute and the total distance traveled. Despite the
precise controls on a distributor,
it
is always advisable to check the rate of application
in
the field. This can be done with a shallow metal tray exactly one square meter in the area.
If a tray
is not available, a sheet of heavy paper or cardboard can also serve the intended
purpose. The tray is weighed and placed on the surface to be sprayed. Immediately after the

distributor has passed, the tray is removed and weighed again. The difference between the
two is the weight of the bitumen emulsion applied on the surface in one sq. meter area.

Aggregate Spreaders
The aggregate spreader is an important equipment for surface dressing.
It applies a uniform
aggregate cover at the specified rate. Spreaders range from the simple vane type attached
to a truck tail gate to the highly efficient self-propelled type. Tail gate spreaders are usually
of two types. One is a steel plate to which
is attached a series of vanes to provide coverage
across the lane. Another
is a truck-mounted hopper with a feed
roller activated by small
wheels driven by the truck wheels.
In each case, the truck backs up to spread the stone.
This prevents the freshly applied bitumen emulsion from being picked up by the truck tires.
Mechanical aggregate spreaders contain hoppers and a built in distribution system to ensure
a uniform spread of the cover aggregate across the entire lane width. Mechanical spreaders
61



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:100-2014
are either truck-attached or self-propelled.
In both types, the aggregate
is dumped from a
truck into a receiving hopper for spreading. The truck attached spreader typically contains an
auger and a roughened spread
roll in the hopper that ensures a positive and uniform feed of
material. The self-propelled unit has a similar feed mechanism. One difference is that the self-
propelled spreader contains a scalping screen over the aggregate receiving hopper. Another
is that there can be a sloped screen that allows the larger particles to drop into the asphalt
film first with the finer particles falling afterwards through the screen. This system ensures
that the larger particles are sufficiently embedded
in the asphalt to hold them
in place. The
self-propelled
unit has the advantage of being able to closely follow behind the bitumen
emulsion
distributor, with minimum stopping to change aggregate trucks. Mechanical
self
propelled aggregate spreaders should be calibrated to apply the designed quantity of cover
stone for any given
project. The required equipment can be very simple and may consist
only of several sheets of canvas, each exactly one square meter (square yard), and a scale.
By making several runs at different speeds and gate openings ever the sheets of canvas
and carefully weighing the aggregate deposited on them, the gate opening and spreader
speed required to apply the cover stone at the specified rate per square meter can be quickly
determined. A typical chip spreader is shown in Photo 11.3.

Cold Mix Plants
Cold bituminous mix involving use of bitumen emulsion as binder is manufactured
in a pug
mill, which blend water based bitumen emulsion with pre wetted aggregates according to
a laboratory job mix formula. The aggregate may be virgin, or RAP and may be used to
produce a low cost and low energy paving material. These cold mixes may be manufactured
by a centrally located or by mobile plant. The mixes may be used for base, binder, leveling
or wearing course or structural overlays. The resiliency of cold mix products to self-heal with
movement from freeze thaw cycles makes them ideal. The key benefits of cold mix paving

Pavers
For plant produced emulsion mixes, the paving procedures are similar to those used for hot
mixed materials. Base courses may be laid with self-propelled base spreaders or even with
a blade. However, self-propelled pavers are recommended for surface courses. Cold mixes
generally are
stiffer than
hot bituminous
mix,
with open-graded mixtures being the most
difficult to place. Proper paver operation
is very
critical for obtaining uniform and smooth
mat. This includes keeping the paver speed as constant as possible and the level of mix on
the augers at a nearly constant depth.
If mix sticks to the paver screed or tearing of the mat
occurs, change in the mixing time or the water content can eliminate the problem. The screed
should not be heated. Plant produced emulsion mixes are placed
in
lifts of 100 mm or more
but compaction and curing proceeds quicker with lifts of 50 to 75 mm. For open-graded mixes,
the breaking of the bitumen emulsion usually occurs quickly. With open-graded mixes, rolling
normally may begin immediately behind the paver. However, the emulsion
in dense-graded
mixes typically does not break for some time. Because of the higher moisture contents for
mixing, a delay in the compaction of dense-graded mixes is usually required. The amount of
delay is dependent on the
lift thickness and the curing conditions of air temperature, humidity
and wind. The rate of water loss controls when compaction may begin.
Because-of the extreme tackiness of open-graded mixes and an
initial low
stability
until
obtaining some aggregate interlock, the breakdown rolling is best accomplished with a static
steel-wheeled
roller. Vibratory rolling of open-graded mixes
is not recommended because
fracture of aggregate and asphalt bonding can occur. A light "choke" or "blotter" of a coarse
sand or fine crusher screenings may he applied after steel-wheeled
rolling. The choke or
blotter permits rolling with a pneumatic- tired
roller and prevents pick-up and darn age by
traffic. The sand or screenings
is applied with a correctional self-propelled chip spreader or
sand spinner at the rate of 3.30 to 06.6 kg/10 m^.
11.7
Rollers
Rolling presses the aggregate down into the bituminous binder, promoting better adhesion.
Unless the cover aggregate
is
properly embedded
in the bitumen
film, there
is a good
possibility that some may be
lost through
traffic abrasion. For single surface treatments,
pneumatic-tired fillers produce best results. They force the aggregate firmly into the bitumen
binder without crushing the particles. The tires press into small depressions to better seat
the particles. Steel wheeled rollers tend to bridge over such depressions and may fracture
the aggregate.
If the roller speed is too high, the roller may dislodge the aggregate. Different
types of rollers are shown in Photo 11.5.

Appendix-1
Test Method for Determination of Bond Strength
Scope
:
This
test method
is
intended
to
determine
the
bond
strength
between
two
superimposed bituminous layers of field and laboratory prepared samples
Apparatus
: Marshall Testing Apparatus, Hammer and Shear Mould
Method
:
a)
Test on samples from field
The cores of the two superimposed bituminous layers such as BC over BC
or BC over DBM
shall be taken out from the
field using the core cutting
machine. The core shall be allowed to cure
in the laboratory for atleast 24
hours. After the curing period, the sample shall be placed in the shear mould
and tested in the Marshall testing machine at 25°C. The failure load is noted
down and shear strength shall be calculated as follows:
Load (at Failure)
Shear Strength =
Area of the surface (resisting the load)
b)
Test on laboratory samples
In the laboratory, Marshall Samples are to be prepared by 50 blows on one
side, such that the thickness of the sample
is about 30-35 mm. Once the
samples are taken out from the mould, tack coat
is applied at the specified
rate on the samples and allowed to cure for 24 hours at room temperature.
After the curing period, the other half part of the Marshall sample is prepared
by applying 50 blows. The sample should be such that half of the sample
is
of the one type of material and the other superimposed half is of other type of
the material and tack coat membrane
is interlayer between two layers. The
sample
is taken out and allowed to cure for 24 hours. After the completion
curing
period, the sample
shall be placed
in the shear mould assembly
Marshall testing machine. Test setup for testing of bond strength of tack coat
between two bituminous layers is showing in Photo 1.

Appendix-7
Test Method for Determination of Torsional Elastic Recovery of Residual Binders
Scope
: The test method
is intended
to determine torsional elastic recovery of modified
residue using a simple bolt and cup assembly.
Apparatus
: Bolt assembly - The bolt has a cylindrical head with diameter of 28.6 mm and
thickness of 9.52 mm and threaded shank of the bold
is 44.5 mm long. A metal spider with
three radial pins and two nuts can be used to centre the assembly. A pointer is required for
angle measurement in the absence of the spider. Sample tin of 85 ml capacity and internal
diameter of 51 to 52 mm; angle measuring device and sample clamp assembly or an alternative
means of clamping the sample/bolt assembly and determining the initial and recovered angle.
The recommended device
shall comprise a scale of 80mm radius graduated
in degrees
around at least half its circumference and a clamp capable of holding the sample cup within
3 mm of its centre and without deforming the cup by more than 3 mm in any direction; water
bath capable to operate at 25°C fitted with thermometer; forced convection oven - capable
of operating in the range 60°C to 200°C; stop watch, spanner to suit bolt assembly.
Method
: The torsional elastic recovery apparatus operates by manually rotating an aluminum
bolt previously embedded
in a cup containing modified binder through an angle of 180° and
measuring the extent of recovery of the original applied rotation.
Initially 180° twist is applied
with a spanner for period of 10s. The recovery after 30s is measured.
Pour the residue into the cup of assembly until
it begins to form a meniscus on the top surface
of the bolt. Allow the assembly with sample to cool for one hour by allowing
it to stand at room
temperature and adjust the assembly height to keep the top surface of the bolt flush with the
surface of the sample. Place the assembly at constant temperature of 25°C
in a water bath
for one hour. Adjust the spider to a position 7 mm above the rim and return the assembly to
the bath. Place the sample assembly on the base plate and fit the pointer to the 180° position
without disturbing the sample. With the help of spanner, turn the bolt moving the pointer from
the 180° position to Zero degree position using a steady motion for 10s. Release the bolt
when the pointer reaches the zero position and commence timing. Record the recovered
angle after 30s. The torsion elastic recovery in percentage is calculated by following:
1 00 X A/1 80,Where A is recovered angle in degrees
Report
:
Report the
torsional
elastic recovery as mean
of three
results
together with
temperature of test and recovery time.

Calibration of Slurry Seal and IVIicrosurfacing Macliine
The purpose of these guidelines
is to familiarize both the users of the slurry seal machine/
microsurfacing machine as well as the client regarding the basic features of modern slurry
seal machine. Both slurry seal and microsurfacing system have three main ingredients
i.e.
aggregates, bitumen emulsion and cement as
filler. Apart from these, water and additive,
if
used are other ingredients for the purpose of workability of the mix. Unlike conventional hot
mix works wherein one crew is involved in mixing of the materials and the other in using
it, the
same crew uses machine to proportion and mix up all the ingredients while laying the finished
product. The modern traffic systems are very sensitive to changes in any of the ingredients as
the same can cause an unsatisfactory mix. This in turn necessitated the accurate calibration
of the machine.
Each
slurry seal/microsurfacing machine
to be used
for execution
of this work
shall be
calibrated prior to construction. The machine
is equipped with suitable means of accurately
metering each individual material and
is capable of delivering a predetermined proportion of
aggregate, water, emulsion, cement and additive to the mixture. Since all feeding mechanism
is continuous, fed and proportioning remains constant at all the time. This mechanism allows
the accurate calibration of the machine so that the exact quantities of materials use during
any period can be estimated.
The
calibration document shall
include
individual
calibration
of each
material
at various
settings, which can be related to the machines metering devices. Normally, counters are
provided on the machine for the purpose of calibration. Weight per minute is calculated at a
particular setting to determine the total outflow of individual material at the setting. Precisely,
the calibrations of machine for aggregate is done first as other components are related to the
quantity of aggregates. Based on the job mid formula approved for the work, the calibration
of machine for other ingredients
i.e. bitumen emulsion, cement, water and additive
(if any)
is done
in the proportion set out therein
after making adjustment to the outflow of these
ingredients at different settings to get the desired results. Bitumen emulsion is adjusted first,
followed by cement, water and additive. Flow chart diagram of outflow of various ingredients
is made for future reference. Once calibrated, the contractor as well as the client notes the
setting of counters for various ingredients and periodical check is made to control the quality
of the mix.

Appendix-9
Method for Design of Cold Mixes
Presently, a standard design procedure is not available for design of cold mixed BM or SDBC.
The cold mix design procedure involves optimization of water as well as content of bitumen
emulsion for the aggregates in the mix. The aggregates are made moist with water to wet its
surface and then coated with cationic bitumen emulsion. The different sizes of aggregates are
blended in proportions to achieve the best standard gradation of BM or SDBC. The following
steps are necessary to design cold mixed BM or SDBC with cationic bitumen emulsion.
a)
Testing of aggregate
: The aggregates supplied are subjected
to sieve
analysis and other physical
tests
for determining the properties such as
specific gravity, aggregate impact value, water absorption and sand equivalent
value.
b)
Testing
of bitumen emulsion
: The samples
of slow
setting
bitumen
emulsion (SS-2) to be used for construction of BM shall be tested as per IS:
8887. The coating test of aggregates shall also be carried out as per ASTM
D 2397 orAASHTOM 208.
c)
Determination of premixing water content
: For determination of optimum
water
content
for
premixing,
the
quantity
of bitumen
emulsion
is
first
determined using the following equation.
P = 0.05A+0.1B+0.5C
... (1)
where,
P = Quantity of bitumen emulsion (%)
A = Percent aggregate retained on 2.36 mm sieve
B = Percent aggregate passing 2.36 mm sieve and retained on 90 micron sieve
C = Percent aggregate passing on 90 micron sieve
Different samples of aggregates and emulsion mixes are prepared keeping the quantity of
bitumen emulsion constant (as determined from Equation 1) and varying the water content.
The coated aggregates are then visually observed for coated area of the aggregate by the
binder. The optimum water content is the water content at which maximum coating of aggregate
occur. This water content is taken as premixed water content in designing the cold mixed BM
or cold mixed SDBC. The optimum water content for BM or SDBC is normally found to be 2 to
3 percent by weight of aggregate. However, this quantity may vary depending on the weather
condition (temperature, humidity and wind velocity) and properties of aggregates.

IRC:SP:100-2014
Determination of Optimum Binder Content
The procedure for the design of cold mix utilises standard Marshall equipment. Marshall test
specimens in triplicate are prepared with different binder content (bitumen emulsion). Different
sizes of aggregates are blended to achieve the specified aggregate gradation. About 1100
gm of graded aggregates are made wet uniformly with optimum water content. The different
percentage of bitumen emulsion, say 5 percent by weight of aggregate, are then added to
the aggregates and mixed for 1-2 minutes for achieving uniform binder coating. The mixture
is dried for about
1 -2 hours using a fan. The cold mix is then kept in oven at 40°C for 2 hours.
The cold mix is then transferred into the Marshall mould with a filter paper on base plate and
compacted with 50 blows of Marshall hammer on both faces. Similarly, the Marshall specimen
are prepared with optimum water content and bitumen emulsion contents of 5,
6, 7, 8 and
9 percent by weight of aggregates. The Marshall specimens are then extracted from the
mould after 24 hours and cured in air oven at 40°C for 72 hours before subjecting to different
Marshall Stability Tests. Marshall specimen are subjected to different tests viz. bulk density,
stability and flow values. Marshall
stability and flow values are determined
in dry state at
25°C.
Different properties of the mixes are determined and other design parameters
like
voids content, voids filled with binder etc. are calculated.
