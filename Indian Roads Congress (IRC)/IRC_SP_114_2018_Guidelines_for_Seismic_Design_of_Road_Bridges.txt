IRC : SP:114-2018
Many bridges in India have suffered severe damages during earthquakes in the past. Bridges 
are vital communication links of infrastructure in a road network and should remain operational 
after an earthquake. In the year 1958, seismic provisions were introduced for the first time, 
for bridge design in IRC: 6, wherein the country was divided into 4 regions based on the 
damage likely to occur, i.e., Region1-Epicentral tracts, Region 2- liable to severe damage, 
Region 3 - liable to moderate damage and Region 4- liable to minor or no damage, and the 
same provisions continued till 1979. Meanwhile, IS: 1893 came up with a different map with 
five seismic zones, which was introduced in IRC: 6 during 1981. Also, for computation of 
seismic force, horizontal seismic coefficient, importance factor and a coefficient to account for 
different soil and foundation system as given in IS:1893:1970 were introduced in IRC:6. Also, 
with major highway development programs taken up in the country in the last few decades 
and increasing frequency of occurrences of earthquakes, particularly, the devastating Bhuj 
Earthquake in 2001, introduction of interim seismic provisions in IRC: 6 during 2003 was 
found essential pending finalization of a comprehensive guideline for seismic design of 
highway bridges. In this interim provision, a new seismic map of India showing four seismic 
zones (as in IS: 1893 Part 1:2002) along with zone factor was introduced. For computation 
of seismic force a force based approach was adopted using spectral acceleration (included 
for three different types of soil), importance factor, dead load and part live load and a single 
Response Reduction Factor for all bridge components. Also, mandatory provisions were 
included to prevent dislodgment of superstructure and ductile detailing of piers in line with 
IS: 13920 to minimize the damage, especially in seismic zones IV and V. Also, to mitigate 
earthquake forces, special seismic devices such as base isolation bearings, STUs, etc. 
were recommended. Subsequently, the Interim Seismic provisions, mentioned above, were 
replaced with new seismic force clause in 2008, which essentially adopted a force based 
design approach and addressing the issues like- Consideration of simultaneous action of 
seismic forces acting in three different directions, near field effects, dynamic earth pressure 
and hydrodynamic forces during earthquake.
Till the year 2011, the bridges were being designed based on working stress approach. 
Meanwhile there had been rapid developments in state-of-the-art in the area of seismic 
resistant design of bridges, like capacity design approach, which have been incorporated 
in many international standards of countries like Japan, USA, New Zealand and Eurocode. 
Similarly, the bridge design codes in India also witnessed a major change with the introduction 
of Limit State Design approach for design in IRC: 6, IRC: 112, IRC: 24 and IRC: 22.
During the year 2010, the need was felt to prepare a comprehensive “Guidelines for Seismic 
Design of Road bridges”, to cater to the requirements of Limit State Design approach, 
following the NDMA guidelines to follow IS 1893, as mandated to B-2 Committee. The basic 
framework of this guideline was prepared by Prof. S.K. Thakkar and Members were identified 
for drafting various Chapters and initial drafting of few chapters were carried out. However, 
during the 2015- 2017, B-2 Committee focused mainly on completing this guideline and the 
following subgroup was constituted vide 3rd, meeting of B2 Committee dated 26 September 
2015 and later on inducted two more members vide 5th & 8th meetings on 20th February 2016 
& 20th August 2016 respectively.

The Sub Group conducted 22 meetings to discuss and finalise various chapters which were 
subsequently sent to main committee for discussion and approval.
This Guideline is essentially applicable for seismic design of bridges with a design service life 
of 100 years, considering Design Basis Earthquake (DBE). It has adopted the seismic map 
and spectral acceleration graphs (both for elastic acceleration method and elastic response 
spectrum method) as specified in IS: 1893-Part-I- 2016. It also adopts the method prescribed 
for evaluation of liquefaction potential, as specified in IS: 1893-Part-I- 2016. For the estimation 
of seismic forces, Elastic Seismic Acceleration method, Elastic Response Spectrum method 
and Linear Time History method have been specified. The Guideline describes the various 
types of special investigations to be carried out for bridges to be constructed in near field 
zones, skew and curved bridges and so on.
The approach adopted for design in this Guideline relies on the principles of capacity 
design, wherein a strength hierarchy is established in a bridge to ensure that the damage 
is controllable, i.e., plastic hinges occur only where the designer intends. Also, the ductile 
detailing of concrete and steel piers have been adequately covered in this Guideline. Also, 
emphasis is given to prevent dislodgement of superstructure and provisions included in the 
Guideline accordingly.
This Guideline is organized in ten chapters and five informative Appendices.
In Chapter 2, the Scope, seismic effects on bridges, general principles of earthquake resistant 
design of bridges, design philosophy and special investigations / analysis to be carried out for 
different type of bridges are included.
Chapter 3 mainly deals with the aspects to be considered during conceptual design in order 
to achieve a safe performance of bridges under seismic action. This essentially includes 
the aspects to be considered during selection of site, structural system and configuration, 
bearings and expansion joints, structural ductility and energy dissipation and type of seismic 
devices.
In Chapter 4, details of seismic induced forces in horizontal (both transverse and longitudinal) 
and vertical direction and their combination, which are to be considered for design, are 
discussed. As stated above, the seismic zone Map and design seismic spectrum included 
are same as that in IS: 1893: Part 1:2016. It may be noted that the damping coefficient of 
5% has been specified irrespective of whether the structure is made of steel or concrete. 
Computation of dynamic component of earth pressure and hydrodynamic forces on bridge 
pier and foundations have been elaborated. Also, the load combinations under ULS and SLS 
have been discussed. Appendix A- 4 includes an illustration of computation of hydrodynamic 
forces on a bridge pier based on the methodology discussed in this Chapter.
Chapter 5 essentially covers in detail the methods for computation of seismic induced forces 
using elastic seismic acceleration method, elastic response spectrum method and linear 
time history analysis method. Also, guidance is provided to select the appropriate analytical 
method to be adopted, which has been prescribed in Table 5.3. Also, the illustrations of

IRC : SP:114-2018
Elastic Seismic Acceleration method and Elastic Response spectrum method have been 
included with appropriate examples in Appendix A-1 and A-2.
Chapter 6 deals with the general design provisions for bridge components. For seismic design 
of the bridge, weak column and strong beam concept has been followed and plastic hinges 
are allowed to form in bridge piers at predetermined locations. In fact, strength based design 
approach, amalgamating the force based approach and capacity design principle, has been 
prescribed in this Guideline for seismic design.
Chapter 7 covers in detail the force based approach, capacity design principles and capacity 
design steps to be followed and the structural components which are to be capacity protected. 
Also included are how the plastic hinge regions are to be designed, special confining 
reinforcement for plastic hinge region, design of portion of pier in between plastic hinge and 
the connections. As the failure mode of pier can be either, flexure or shear, the minimum 
shear force to be considered has been duly incorporated. This Chapter is mainly in line with 
the latest Eurocode provision and illustrative examples are included in Appendix A-3.
Chapter 8 deals with design of various structural components such as superstructure, piers and 
abutments and foundations under seismic action. Identification of potentially liquefiable soils 
is emphasized and an illustrative example has been included in Appendix A- 5. Provisions for 
bearings, seismic connections including STU’s and expansion joints have been elaborated. 
The aim of these provisions is essentially to prevent the dislodgement of superstructure by 
provision of reaction blocks, restrainers, rigid link or tie bars and so on.
As the design approach essentially depends on the ductility of pier, this can be achieved 
by ductile detailing of concrete and steel pier. Though IRC 112 has a Chapter on ductile 
detailing, additional provisions have been included in the Guideline for concrete piers. A 
new addition in this Guideline is the ductile detailing of steel components, as these aspects 
are not included in any of the IRC steel bridge codes. The ductile detailing provisions are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 9.
Main focus of Chapter 10 is Seismic Isolation Devices. This Guideline permits the use of 
seismic isolation bearings for the design of bridges. The use of viscous dampers for seismic 
protection has been emphasized. Besides, the situations where seismic isolation devices 
need to be provided, analysis and design of bridge provided with seismic isolation devices 
are elaborated in this Chapter.
This comprehensive Guideline is intended to benefit the bridge designers for sustainable 
design of bridges under seismic conditions and suitably for better understanding of the 
behavior of the bridge structures under seismic condition adopting Limit State Method of 
design.
After publication of this Guideline, the existing provision for seismic design in Clause 219 of 
IRC: 6 -2017 stands superseded.

2.3	
Relaxation Clauses
	
i.	
Culverts and minor bridges up to 10 m length in all seismic zones need not 
be designed for seismic effects.
	
ii.	
Bridges in seismic zones II and III satisfying both limits of total length not 
exceeding 60 m and individual simply supported spans not exceeding 15 m 
need not be designed for seismic effects.
	
iii.	
The dynamic earth pressures on abutments during earthquakes shall not be 
considered in Zones II and III.
2.4	
General Principles
The following general principles shall be followed in earthquake resistant design of bridges:
	
i.	
The bridge should be designed for DBE/MCE according to the design 
philosophy specified in the guidelines, using limit state design procedure 
employing Force Based Method of seismic design and response reduction 
factors. The Force Based Design should meet the design philosophy and the 
principles of capacity design should be followed to protect the structure from 
collapse.
	
ii.	
In case site specific spectra is used, the minimum values of seismic forces 
and displacements in the structure shall not be smaller than those arrived at 
from the code response spectrum.
	
iii.	
The scour to be considered during seismic design shall be based on average 
of yearly maximum design floods. The average may preferably be based on 
consecutive 7 years’ data. In any case, the scour depth to be considered for 
design during seismic shall not be less than 0.9 times the maximum design 
scour depth.
	
iv.	
The earthquake accelerations should be applied to full mass in case of 
submerged structures and not on buoyant mass.
	
v.	
The seismic force on live load in bridges should not be considered in 
longitudinal direction. The seismic force on live load should be considered 
on reduced live load in transverse direction.

Seismic Effects on Bridges
The seismic effects on bridges can be classified as (i) Seismic displacements (ii) Pier failure 
(iii) Expansion Joint failure (iv) bearing failure (vi) Abutment slumping and (vii) foundation 
failure, (viii) Partial and complete collapse of bridges due to soil liquefaction.
In horizontally curved superstructure, transverse movement of superstructure translates into 
longitudinal movement at a joint, which could lead to unseating of deck. In skewed bridges, 
the centre of mass usually does not coincide with centre of stiffness, which causes rotation

of superstructure and large displacements at supports. Also, bridges with large skew angle 
could rotate and unseat the superstructure under seismic action.
Under earthquake action the bridge decks are subjected to transverse or longitudinal 
displacement depending on the direction of earthquake. In some situations when sufficient 
bearing seat width is not provided, the unseating of deck take place. The asynchronous 
movement of two adjoining spans during earthquake leads to pounding action and cause 
damage to deck /beam ends, if adequate separation gaps are not provided.
Bridge piers designed without ductile detailing are prone to spalling of cover concrete, buckling 
of longitudinal reinforcement and crumbling of core concrete. Effect of vertical acceleration, 
in near field region, often changes the failure mode of bridge pier from flexure to shear. Shear 
failure of bridge piers may be due to inadequate or no ductile detailing or improper/ premature 
curtailment of longitudinal reinforcement or design not based on capacity design methods.
Expansion joints are subjected to compression or tension failure during earthquake. When 
superstructure is subjected to substantial lateral and longitudinal force during earthquake, it 
can lead to failure of bearing or of connections to substructure.
During earthquake slumping of abutment fill and rotation of abutments occur in case the 
abutment fill is incompletely consolidated. Abutment back wall may get damaged due to 
superstructure impact. When bridges are founded on soft or liquefiable soils, amplification of 
structural vibration response under seismic action had resulted in unseating of bridge deck, 
especially in simply supported spans.
2.6	
Design Philosophy
	
i.	
Under Design Basis Earthquake (DBE), a moderate earthquake, which may 
occur more frequently in the life of a structure; the bridge should be able to 
withstand earthquake with minor structural damage.
	
ii.	
Under Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE), a large earthquake, which 
may occur once in the life of a structure; the bridge may be subjected to 
significant structural damage but not collapse. The damage should be readily 
accessible for inspection and repair.
	
iii.	
The bridges with design life of up to 100 years may be designed for DBE 
only. The bridges with design life of more than 100 years may be designed 
both for DBE and MCE.

2.7.1	
Definitions
	
1.	
Asynchronous motion:
	
	
Spatial variability of the seismic action means that the ground motion at 
different supports of the bridge is different and as a result the definition of

a single point, as is usually the case.
	
2.	
Base:
	
	
The level at which inertial forces generated in the substructure and 
superstructure are transferred to the foundation.
	
3.	
Capacity Design:

behaviour to secure the hierarchy of strengths of various structural 
components necessary for leading to intended configuration of plastic hinges 
and for avoiding brittle failure modes.
	
4.	
Centre of Mass:
	
	
The point through which the resultant of the masses of a system acts. This 
point corresponds to the centre of gravity of the system.
	
5.

CHAPTER 3
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
3.1	
General
The chapter generally deals with the aspects to be considered during conceptual design for 
safe performance of bridges under seismic action. This includes the criteria for site selection, 
selection of bridge structural configuration based on seismic behaviour, choice of articulation 
system such as bearing and expansion joints, effect of time period on design of bridges & 
structural ductility and energy dissipation
3.2	
Site Selection
While finalising the bridge site, apart from other considerations, seismic vulnerability needs 
to be taken into account. The preferred bridge sites from consideration of seismic hazard is 
the one which is not near active faults, where the soil do not have potential for liquefaction 
and where stiff and stable soil is available to provide required resistance against the forces 
generated due to earthquake. The site prone to landslide should be preferably avoided. These 
considerations are to be followed as far as practicable and in case these are not possible to 
be adhered to, mitigating measures are to be taken the bridges in Zones IV and V should be 
founded preferably on rock, firm alluvium or stable soil layers.
3.3	
Structural System and Configuration
3.3.1	
Preferred Structural Configuration
The preferred structural system and configuration from seismic behaviour considerations are 
given in the table below, along with the non-preferred types, for which special design and 
detailing are required.

Right Bridges or Bridges with mild 
curvature, small skews (i.e. radius 
of Curvature ≥ 100 m & Skew 
≤ 30o). (Right Bridges provides a 
direct load path with predictable 
response under seismic loads. 
Bridges with sharp curvature and 
large skew angles experience 
larger 
and 
unpredictable 
deformations, which in turn, results 
in larger ductility demands and also 
imparts torsional effects);

Adjacent Piers of near equal 
heights and near equal stiffness

concentration of seismic shear 
forces in the shorter columns, 
which may cause brittle shear 
failure)

displacements, 
considering 
out

to 
improve seismic performance of

Bearings and Expansion Joints
3.4.1	
General Requirements:
Horizontal actions on the deck shall be transmitted to the supporting members through the 
structural connections which may be monolithic (e,g. in case of integral bridges), or through 
bearings. Seismic stoppers / Seismic links may be used to transmit the entire design seismic 
action, provided dynamic shock effects are mitigated and properly taken into account. 
When seismic links / stoppers are used to transmit seismic actions, they should allow 
non-seismic displacements of the bridge without transmitting any significant loads to the 
substructure and foundation on this account.
When seismic links / stoppers are used, elastomeric bearings placed vertically shall be 
used in between the stoppers and the Superstructure to mitigate the dynamic effects. The 
behaviour of the structure as a whole needs to be modelled properly in the analysis, duly 
taking into account the force-displacement relationship of the linked structure.
3.4.2	
Bearings:
Function of a bearing is to transfer the vertical and lateral loads from Superstructure to 
the foundation through substructure, fulfilling the design requirements and allowing the 
displacements and rotations as required by the structural analysis with very low resistance 
during the whole life time. The bearings are generally of following types:
	
a)	
Metallic Rocker and Roller-cum rocker type rigid bearings, where the load 
transmission is through linear knife edges.
	
b)	
Pot cum PTFE Bearings / Spherical Bearings of rigid type with Fixed or 
Free Sliding arrangement where load transfer from superstructure is over a 
specified area in plan.
	
c)	
Flexible Elastomeric bearings where the bearing allows relative movements 
between superstructure and substructure by its flexibility and by preventing 
the transmission of harmful forces, bending moments and vibrations. 
While the Rigid bearings specified in a) and b) above can be used under any circumstances, 
following the provisions of relevant IRC codes, following guidelines are recommended in 
case of elastomeric bearings :
Elastomeric Bearings can be used with following possible arrangements:
	
i.	
Elastomeric Bearings provided on individual supports to transfer vertical loads 
and nonseismic lateral loads and to accommodate imposed deformations 
and translations. Seismic actions are transferred to substructure by lateral 
connections (monolithic or through pin bearings/guided bearings) of the deck 
to other supporting members (piers or abutments).



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 146
======================================================================
22
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
ii.	
On all or individual supports, with the same function as in (i) above, combined 
with seismic links / seismic stoppers which are designed to resist seismic 
actions.
	
iii.	
On all supports to resist both seismic as well as non-seismic actions. In this 
case the seismic response of substructure and Superstructure shall remain 
essentially elastic and therefore response reduction factor for design shall be 
considered as 1.
In case of Elastomeric Bearing use with arrangements as in (i) and (ii) above, the normal low 
damping elastomeric bearings (i.e. damping ratio less than 0.06 can be used).
In case of elastomeric bearings used with arrangements as in (iii), these bearings shall be 
designed as ‘isolation bearings. Low damping bearing can also be used as isolation bearing 
for which reference can be made to IRC : 83. For use of high damping bearing reference to 
Chapter 8 shall be made.
3.4.3	
Expansion Joints:
The design expansion gap to be provided at the expansion joint, shall be adequate to ensure 
damage tolerant structure under a design seismic event. Parts of the bridge susceptible to 
damage by their contribution to energy dissipation during the design seismic event should 
be designed in a manner aiming at enabling the bridge to be used by emergency traffic, 
following the seismic event and at easily repairable damages.
3.5	
Time Period of Bridge
	
i.	
It is preferable to design bridges in zones IV and V in such a way that 
fundamental period falls in most favourable range in both longitudinal and 
transverse directions such that the seismic demands are smaller both in the 
structure and foundation.
	
ii.	
Various methods to enhance time periods of piers may be explored such as 
using framed substructure, cantilever piers with near equal stiffness in two 
principal directions and use of seismic isolation bearings.
	
iii.	
For computing time period, due consideration shall be given to the flexibility 
available to the bridge from pile/well foundation due to soil structure interaction 
for maximum and no scour condition. The consideration of flexibility leads 
to longer period of vibration of substructure resulting in reduced seismic 
demand.
3.6	
Structural Ductility and Energy Dissipation
Seismic design of bridge is generally achieved by providing adequate strength and ductility 
of substructure. The energy dissipation takes place due to inelastic behaviour of pier. The 
location of plastic hinge should be predetermined and the required flexural strength of the 
plastic hinge shall be obtained using capacity-based design approach. 



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 146
======================================================================
23
IRC : SP:114-2018
RCC/PSC substructure shall be designed as under reinforced and adequately detailed to 
avoid premature failure due to shear and bond. Plastic hinge regions shall be provided with 
close spaced transverse stirrups to confine the compressed concrete within the core region 
and to prevent buckling of longitudinal reinforcement.
In steel substructure, the compression zones require detailing to avoid premature buckling 
and joints require proper detailing to ensure overall ductile behaviour of the structure.
3.7	
Use of Seismic Devices
Special devices such as Shock Transmission Units (STU’s), seismic isolation bearings and 
viscous dampers offer feasible solutions for seismic resistant design of bridges.
Multi span bridges, with continuous superstructure, are generally provided with fixed bearing 
over one pier or abutment. In order to distribute the seismic force generated by superstructure 
to other piers/abutments STU’s may be used between superstructure and other piers/ 
abutments where free bearings are used.
Seismic isolation devices/ bearings are provided in multi span continuous bridges which are 
rigid or stiff with time period less than 1.0 seconds, founded on firm soil strata, to reduce the 
seismic demand by enhancing the time period and increasing the damping.
Viscous dampers are used to connect the structural members both in longitudinal and 
transverse direction. They help in dissipating the seismic energy and thereby reduce the 
displacement. For seismic devices Chapter-10 shall be referred for more details.

CHAPTER 4
SEISMIC INDUCED FORCES AND SITE CONDITIONS
4.1	
General
The chapter primarily cover the seismic induced forces in horizontal and vertical direction and 
their combination. The chapter includes seismic zone map, design seismic spectrums which 
are same as that of IS: - 1893-Part-I-2016, response reduction factor R, importance factor, 
effects of soil structure interaction and hydrodynamic forces on bridge piers and foundations.
4.2	
Ground Motion (Horizontal and Vertical)
The horizontal ground motions in longitudinal and transverse directions of bridge cause most 
damaging effects in earthquakes. The vertical motion in bridge can arise due to vertical ground 
motion and vertical motion in cantilever spans arising due to horizontal motion of piers. The 
effect of vertical ground motions is important in bridges with long spans, prestressed concrete 
spans, bridges with long horizontal cantilevers and where stability is the criteria of design. 
The vertical ground motions can be quite significant in near field earthquakes.
4.2.1	
Components of Ground Motion
The characteristics of seismic ground motion expected at any location depend upon the 
magnitude of earthquake, depth of focus, distance of epicenter and characteristics of the path 
through which the seismic wave travels. The random ground motion can be resolved in three 
mutually perpendicular directions. The components are considered to act  simultaneously, 
but independently and their method of combination is described in Section 4.2.2
In zones IV and V the effects of vertical components shall be considered for all elements of 
the bridge. However, the effect of vertical component may be omitted for all elements in zone 
II and III, except for the following cases:
	
(a)	
prestressed concrete superstructure
	
(b)	
bearings and linkages
	
(c)	
horizontal cantilever structural elements
	
(d)	
for stability checks and
	
(e)	
bridges located in the near field regions
4.2.2	
Combination of Component Motions
The seismic forces shall be assumed to come from any horizontal direction. For this purpose 
two separate analyses shall be performed for design seismic forces acting along two 
orthogonal horizontal directions. The design seismic force resultants (i.e. axial force, bending 
moments, shear forces, and torsion) at any cross-section of a bridge component resulting 



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 146
======================================================================
25
IRC : SP:114-2018
from the analyses in the two orthogonal horizontal directions (x,z) shall be combined as 
below:
	
a)	
±r1±0.3r2
	
b)	
±0.3r1±r2
Where,
	
r1=	
Force resultant due to full design seismic force along x direction. 
	
r2=	
Force resultant due to full design seismic force along z direction.
When vertical seismic forces are also considered, the design seismic force resultants at any 
cross section of a bridge component shall be combined as below:
	
a)	
±r1±0.3r2±0.3r3
	
b)	
±0.3r1±r2±0.3r3
	
c)	
±0.3r1± 0.3r2±r3
Where,
r1 and r2 are as defined above and r3 is the force resultant due to full design seismic force 
along the vertical direction.
Note: The earthquake motion have been combined for all cases irrespective of 
whether structure is orthogonal/skew/curved/irregular.
4.2.3	
Vertical component of Seismic action
Analysis for vertical seismic action requires time period of superstructure in vertical direction. 
Time period for the superstructure has to be worked out separately using the property of the 
superstructure, in order to estimate the seismic acceleration coefficient (Sa/g) for vertical 
acceleration. It can be obtained by free vibration analysis of superstructure using standard 
structural analysis software. However, for simply supported superstructure with nearly uniform 
flexural rigidity, the fundamental time period Tv, for vertical motion can be estimated using the 
expression:
	
	
	
Eq. 4.1
Where,
l is the span metres, m is the mass per unit length (N-m), and EI is the flexural rigidity of the 
superstructure in N-m2.
EI may be estimated for simply supported span as (l 3/48 ▲), where ▲is deflection of span 
due unit point load applied on it.
The seismic zone factor for vertical ground motions may be taken as two-thirds of that for 
horizontal motions.

the response reduction factor (R) shall be taken as 1.0 for all substructure. 
In case substructure and foundation will remain in elastic state, no ductile

iv.	
Ductile detailing is mandatory for piers of bridges located in seismic zones 
III, IV and V where plastic hinges are likely to form and when adopted for 
bridges in seismic zone II, for which “R value with ductile detailing” as given 
in Table 4.1 shall be used.

response reduction factors given in Table 4.1 and (b) forces developed 
due to over strength moment when hinge is formed in the substructure. For 
calculation of overstrength moments, (Mo) shall be considered as Mo=γo MRd 
γo = Overstrength factor and MRD is plastic moment of section, for detail refer 
Chapter 7. Over-strength factors for Concrete members: γo= 1.35 & for Steel 
members: γo = 1.25

The shear force for over strength moments in case of cantilever piers shall 
be calculated as MRD/h, “h” is height shown in Fig 7.1 in Chapter 7. In case 
of portal type pier capacity of all possible hinges need to be considered.
	
vii.	
Capacity Design should be carried out where plastic hinges are likely to form.

Seismic Zone Map and Design Seismic Spectrum
For the purpose of determining the seismic forces, the Country is classified into four zones 
as shown in Fig. 4.1. For each Zone a factor ‘Z’ is associated, the value of which is given in

Soil Structural Interaction, Damping and Soil properties
For bridges founded on soft/ medium soil where deep foundation is used for the purpose 
of seismic analysis, soil structure interaction shall be considered. However, it shall not be 
considered for open foundation on rocky strata.
While modelling the substructure and foundation of the bridge considering soil–structure 
interaction effects, flexibility of soil is included with the help of soil springs. The effect of 
considering soil-structure interaction, in general, results in longer time period for the 
pierfoundation system, thereby reducing the seismic forces. However, considering soil 
flexibilities shall result in large displacements. Therefore, soil parameters, like elastic 
properties and spring constants shall be properly estimated. There are situations, where one 
obtains a range of values for soil properties. In such cases, the highest values of soil stiffness 
shall be used for calculating the natural period and lowest value shall be used for calculating 
displacement.

Importance Factor
Bridges are designed to resist Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) level, or other higher or 
lower magnitude of forces, depending on the consequences of their partial or complete 
non-availability, due to damage or failure from seismic events. The level of design force 
is obtained by multiplying (Z/2) by factor ‘I’, which represents seismic importance of the 
structure. Combination of factors considered in assessing the consequences of failure and 
hence choice of factor ’I’- include inter alia,
	
a.	
Extent of disturbance to traffic and possibility of providing temporary diversion,
	
b.	
Availability of alternative routes,
	
c.	
Cost of repairs and time involved, which depend on the extent of damages, 
- minor or major
	
d.	
Cost of replacement, and time involved in reconstruction in case of failure
	
e.	
Indirect economic loss due to its partial or full non-availability
The importance of bridge will be categorized according to following types:

The horizontal seismic force in the direction perpendicular to the traffic shall be calculated 20 
percent of live load (excluding impact factor).
The vertical seismic force shall be calculated for 20 percent live load (excluding impact 
factor).
All live load combination for verification of equilibrium, structural strength, serviceability limit 
state etc. the Tables B.1 to B.4 of IRC: 6-2017 shall be referred.

Seismic Effects on Earth Pressure and Dynamic Component
For seismic effects on earth pressure and dynamic component the clause 214.1.2 of IRC-6-
2017 shall be referred.
The modified earth pressure forces described in above clause need not be considered on the 
portion of the structure below scour level.
For embedded portion of foundation at depths exceeding 30 m below scour level, the seismic 
force due to foundation mass may be computed using design seismic coefficient equal to 
0.5Ah. For portion of foundation between the scour level and up to 30 m depth, the seismic 
force due to that portion of foundation mass may be computed using seismic coefficient 
obtained by linearly interpolating between Ah at scour level and 0.5Ah at a depth 30 m below 
scour level
4.8	
Hydrodynamic Forces on Bridge Piers and Foundations
The hydrodynamic action on bridge piers can be computed by any of the following procedures:
	
i.	
Total hydrodynamic force and pressure distribution along the height of 
submerged piers following the method of cylinder analogy shall be adopted. 
This method is suitable when Seismic Coefficient Method of analysis is 
employed.
	
ii.	
Computing ‘Added Mass’ of water contained in enveloping cylinder and 
adding this mass with the inertial mass of pier. This method is suitable when 
dynamic analysis such as Response Spectrum Method or Time History 
method is employed. Method of computing added mass of water is explained 
in Appendix A-4
	
	
When the earthquake occurs, hydrodynamic forces shall be considered 
acting on all submerged parts of structures such as piers, well caps, wells, 
pile caps, piles and the connecting beams between the two wells if existing, 
over the submerged height up to scour level in addition to the seismic force 
calculated on the mass of the respective part of the structure. This force shall 
be considered to act in the horizontal direction corresponding to the direction 
of earthquake motion. The total horizontal force shall be evaluated by 
Eq. 4.2
	
	
F = Ce × ah× W

SEISMIC ANALYSIS METHODS
5.1	
General
This chapter discuss in detail the methods of computation of seismic induced forces using 
elastic seismic acceleration method, elastic response spectrum methods and linear time 
history method. Two types of spectra are introduced which is in line with the provision of 
IS: - 1893-Part-1-2016. For determining spectrum to be used to estimate of (Sa/g), the type 
of soil on which the structure rests is explained in Table 5.1. Also the guidance is provided to 
select the appropriate analytical method in Table 5.3.

Seismic Analysis Methods
The Seismic analysis of the bridges shall be carried out using the following methods as per 
applicability defined in Table 5.3, depending upon the complexity of the structure and the 
input ground motion.

Elastic Seismic Acceleration Method:
For most of the structures of low to medium heights with small spand and small length of 
bridge , elastic seismic acceleration method (Seismic coefficient method) is adequate. In this 
method structure is analysed its fundamental(single) mode of vibration. The seismic force to 
be resisted by bridge components shall be computed as follows:
	
Fh = Ah x (Dead load +Appropriate live load)
	
Where,
	
Fh = horizontal seismic force to be resisted.
	
Ah = design horizontal seismic coefficient
The design horizontal seismic coefficient shall be determined as follows:

Note: in the absence of calculations of fundamental period of small bridges, the value of 
S
g
a  
may be taken as 2.5
Fundamental time period of bridge component is to be calculated by any rational method 
of analysis by adopting the Modulus of Elasticity of Concrete (Ecm) as per IRC: 112, and 
considering moment of inertia of cracked section, which can be taken as 0.75 times the 
moment of inertia of gross uncracked section, in the absence of rigorous calculation.
The fundamental natural period T (in seconds) of pier/abutment of the bridge along a horizontal 
direction may be estimated by the following expression:
T
D
F
= 2 0 1000
.
Where,
D	
=	
Appropriate dead load of the superstructure and live load in kN
F	
=	
Horizontal force in kN required to be applied at the centre of mass of 
superstructure for one mm horizontal deflection at the top of the pier/ 
abutment for the earthquake in the transverse direction; and the force to 
be applied at the top of the bearings for the earthquake in the longitudinal 
direction.
Its applicability on specific structure type is given below along with comparison in Table 5.2
	
a)	
Pier height of bridge is less than 30 m.
	
b)	
Bridge having no abrupt or unusual changes in mass, stiffness or geometry 
along its span.
	
c)	
Bridge should be straight in and adjacent piers do not differ in stiffness by 
more than 25%.
This method is not applicable for arch bridge of span more than 30m, cable supported bridges, 
suspension bridges and other innovative bridge. This method is illustrated in Appendix A-1

in which dynamic analysis of the structure is performed to obtain the first as well as higher 
modes of vibration. The forces are obtained for each mode by use of response spectrum as 
given in Fig 5.1 (b) above and
The following steps are required in Elastic Response Spectrum Method
	
1)	
Formulation of an appropriate mathematical model consisting of lumped 
mass system using 2D/3D beam elements. The mathematical model should 
suitably represent dynamic characteristic of superstructure, bearings, sub-
structure, and foundation and soil/ rock spring. In rock and very stiff soil fixed 
base may be assumed.
	
2)	
Determination of natural frequency and mode shapes following a standard 
transfer matrix, stiffness matrix, finite element method or any other approach.
	
3)	
Determine total response by combining responses in various modes by mode 
combination procedure such as Square Root of the Sum of the Squares 
(SRSS), Complete Quadratic Combination (CQC) etc.
	
4)	
Calculate the base shear values computed at (3).
This method is suitable for pier height more than 30 m and for Bridges having abrupt or 
unusual changes in mass, stiffness or geometry along its span. Applicability of this method 
also explained in Table 5.3. This method is illustrated in Appendix A-2
5.2.3

Time - History Method
In bridges where pier height are high, bridge has abrupt or unusual changes in mass, stiffness 
or geometry along its span and has large differences in these parameters between adjacent 
supports, special seismic devices such as dampers, isolator shock transmission unit etc are 
provided and where the large spatial variation need to considered than time history method 
should be used. The dynamic analysis of a bridge by time history method may be carried out 
using direct step-by-step method of integration of equations of motion suitable steps small 
enough to include response of highest modes of vibration. This method is also recommended 
in situations where large number of modes vibration are expected to participate in bridge 
response.
5.3.1	
General
The seismic motion shall be represented in terms of ground acceleration time-histories 
and related quantities (velocity and displacement). When a spatial model of the structure 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 146
======================================================================
39
IRC : SP:114-2018
is required, the seismic motion shall consist of three simultaneously acting accelerograms. 
The same accelerogram may not be used simultaneously along both horizontal directions. 
Depending on the nature of the application and on the information actually available, the 
description of the seismic motion may be made by using artificial accelerograms and recorded 
or simulated accelerograms.
5.3.2	
Artificial Acelerograms
Artificial accelerograms shall be generated using elastic response Spectra given in 
Fig 5.1(b) and site specific elastic response spectra .The duration of the accelerograms shall 
be consistent with the magnitude and other relevant features of the seismic event underlying 
the establishment of ag.(peak ground acceleration).When site-specific data are not available, 
the duration of the time history shall be not less than 30 sec out of which the strong motion 
duration shall not be less than 6 sec.
The characteristics of artificial accelerograms should observe the following rules:
	
a.	
Minimum of 3 sets of time history should be used.
	
b.	
The mean of the zero period spectral response acceleration values (calculated 
from the individual time histories) should not be smaller than the value of ag 
( peak ground acceleration) for the site in question.
5.3.3	
Recorded or Simulated Accelerograms
Recorded accelerograms are generated through a physical simulation of source and travel 
path mechanisms. The samples used are adequately qualified with regard to the seismic 
genetic features of the sources and to the soil conditions appropriate to the site. This values 
are scaled to the value of ag for the zone under consideration. Scaling shall be carried out 
so that the peak ground acceleration shall not lower than 1.3 times the 5 % damped elastic 
response spectrum of the design seismic loads in the period ranging between 0.2 T1 and 
1.5 T1 were T1 is natural period of the fundamental mode of the structure.
5.4	
Minimum Design Horizontal Seismic Force
Bridges and its components shall be designed and constructed to resist the effects of design 
Horizontal Seismic force specified above. But regardless of horizontal seismic acceleration 
coefficient Ah arrived at as per clause 5.2.1., bridges shall have lateral load resisting system 
capable of resisting horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient not less than Ah- Min given in

CHAPTER 6
GENERAL DESIGN PROVISIONS
6.1	
General
The contents of this chapter deals with general provision adopted for seismic design of 
bridges. Strong beam and week column concept is followed and plastic hinges are allowed 
to form in bridge piers at predetermined locations. In fact a strength based design approach 
amalgamating the force based approach and capacity design principle for seismic design 
has been detailed in this chapter.
6.2	
Basic Design Principles
The superstructure, substructure- piers and abutments, bearings, expansion joints, backfill 
in abutments, bridge approach, foundation and founding soil are vulnerable to damage due 
to vibratory effects of earthquake motion. The earthquake resistant design measures shall 
consider these effects on the bridge components arising due to three orthogonal components 
of ground motions in order to minimize damage. In this section ‘Basic Design Principles’ for 
seismic design of various bridge components are laid down.
6.3	
Seismic Design Aspects
6.3.1	
Strength, ductility and energy dissipation
	
i.	
The beneficial effect of bridge flexibility, damping characteristics, energy 
dissipation and isolation by using seismic protection /isolation devices and 
ductility in seismic response reduction should be duly accounted in seismic 
analysis and design.
	
ii.	
The seismic design of the bridge is achieved by providing adequate strength 
and ductility in the members resisting seismic action under design earthquake 
motion. The horizontal strength and stiffness of substructure should not vary 
significantly along the bridge length.
	
iii.	
The likely location of plastic hinge regions in the event of major earthquakes 
should be pre identified.
	
iv.	
Unless external seismic isolation /protection devices are used to reduce 
the seismic demand on structure, the majority of energy dissipation in the 
structure takes place due to inelastic action in plastic hinges occurring in 
major earthquakes. The ductility provisions in plastic hinge regions should 
therefore be ensured as required by seismic codes.
	
v.	
The capacity protected regions of substructure/foundation can be designed 
elastically without ductility provisions.



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 146
======================================================================
42
IRC : SP:114-2018
6.3.2	
Capacity Design
Force demands for essentially elastic components adjacent to ductile components should be 
determined by capacity-design principle, that is, joint-force equilibrium conditions; considering 
plastic hinge capacity at hinge location multiplied by over strength factor. The over strength 
factors should not be used where plastic hinges are not likely to be formed. Force demands 
calculated from linear elastic analysis should not be used in capacity protected regions.
6.3.3	
Overstrength Factor
The over strength factor is a multiplying factor to plastic moment capacity at hinge location. 
This factor represents various sources of over strength such as unintentional increase in 
material properties, post-yield strain hardening, rounding off dimension of members and 
providing excess reinforcement than required.
6.3.4	
Ductility Capacity and Demand
The global displacement capacity of structure should not be less than the estimated 
displacement demands under a design earthquake and local displacement capacity of its 
individual members. The ductility capacity should be greater than ductility demand.
6.4	
Design Provisions
6.4.1	
Superstructure
	
i.	
The superstructures with simply supported spans on bearings are vulnerable 
to damage because these are prone to being unseated or toppled from 
their supporting sub-structures due to either shaking or differential support 
movement associated with ground motion. In such cases, provision such 
as larger seat widths, using unseating prevention devices, holding-down 
devices or interlinking of spans by linkages should be made to prevent spans 
dislodgement off their supports.
	
ii.	
The superstructure should remain elastic even when the plastic hinge location 
in columns/piers reach their plastic moment capacity.
	
iii.	
In order to ensure elastic behaviour in superstructure capacity design 
principle shall be adopted.
6.4.2	
Substructure
	
i.	
Plastic hinges should develop in columns rather than in capping beams or 
superstructures under seismic conditions. The locations of potential plastic 
hinges in piers should be pre-selected so as to ensure their accessibility for 
inspection and repair.
	
ii.	
The shear failure in columns should be avoided by ductile design and 
detailing practice. The pier shall be capable of resisting shear corresponding 



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 146
======================================================================
43
IRC : SP:114-2018
to over strength plastic moment developed in plastic hinge region. This shall 
be ensured by ductile design and detailing practices.
	
iii.	
The number of piers and abutments that will resist seismic force in longitudinal 
or transverse directions should be pre-selected
6.4.3	
Bearings and Expansion Joints
	
i.	
The inertia forces generated on superstructure due to seismic effects should 
preferably be transferred to piers/abutments through fixed bearings capable 
of withstanding horizontal loads.
	
ii.	
Wherever the fixed bearings are used, they shall be designed for the design 
seismic action determined through capacity design. Alternatively linkages 
shall be used to withstand seismic action.
	
iii.	
The out of phase motion between two piers due to various causes such as 
different soil properties under pier foundations, wave travel time effect in 
longer spans and different stiffness of piers due to unequal heights or cross-
sectional dimensions shall be considered in working out design seismic 
displacement in bearings & expansion joints.
	
iv.	
Wherever movable bearings are used, they shall allow seismic displacements 
due to possible out of phase motion of piers. Additionally these bearings 
should be provided with displacement limiting devices such as stoppers, 
linkages etc.
	
v.	
Wherever the elastomeric bearings are used, these bearing shall 
accommodate imposed deformations and normally resist only non-seismic 
actions. The resistance to seismic action is provided by structural connections 
of the deck to piers or abutments through suitable means. 
	
	
In case, in-plane horizontal seismic forces are to be transmitted using these 
elastomeric bearings, they shall be checked using minimum dynamic frictional 
value and minimum vertical loads, including combined effect of vertical and 
horizontal components of earthquake. In such cases suitable devices for 
preventing dislodgement of superstructure shall be provided.
	
	
Where high damping elastomeric bearings are used to resist seismic action, 
these may be designed to act as seismic isolation bearing for which Chapter-8 
shall be referred.
6.4.4	
Foundation
	
i.	
Force demands on foundations should be based on capacity design 
principle that is, plastic capacity of bases of columns/piers multiplied with an 
appropriate over strength factor. Foundation elements should be designed to 
remain essentially elastic. Pile foundations may experience limited inelastic 
deformations; in such cases these should be designed and detailed for 
ductile behaviour.



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 146
======================================================================
44
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
ii.	
In case of well and pile foundations, the foundations should be taken deeper 
into soil layers where liquefaction is not likely to occur.
6.5	
Long span bridges
Long span bridges like cable stayed, suspension bridges, or the bridges crossing non-
homogeneous soil formations can be affected by spatial and temporal variations in ground 
motions. The number and location of intermediate joints should be decided duly considering 
the above effects. The different piers are subjected to different ground motions at any one 
time, because seismic waves take time to travel from one pier to another. Detailed seismic 
studies considering multi-support excitation shall be necessary to determine earthquake 
effects on such bridges.
6.6	
Special Types of Bridges
These bridges shall be designed for site-specific spectrum for which no separate importance 
factor shall be specified. The site specific spectrum, time history of design earthquakes, DBE 
and MCE shall be specified for seismic design.

CHAPTER 7
SEISMIC DESIGN METHOD
7.1	
General
This Chapter includes Force Based Design Method to be used for design of members for the 
seismic forces computed from Seismic Analysis as described in Chapters-4 and Chapter-5 
and Capacity Design to be followed for checking the member sections adjacent to ductile 
components/plastic hinges. Members designed for ductility, components adjacent to plastic 
hinges have to remain elastic during earthquake and the procedure to be adopted to ensure 
the same is specified herein.
7.2	
Force Based Design Method
The seismic design should be carried out using Force Based Design method. In this method 
of design the strength is determined from elastic seismic response based forces reduced by 
response reduction factors specified in Chapter - 4. The response reduction factors represent 
primarily the ductility and redundancy in the system. The following are broad steps in Force 
Based Design:
	
a.	
The structural configuration of the bridge is chosen and member sizes are 
estimated. In most cases the configuration will be governed by non-seismic 
load considerations. However consideration must be given to minimize 
seismic effects while selecting structural configuration, member shapes and 
foundation type based on ‘Conceptual Design’ as given in Chapter- 3.
	
b.	
Stiffness of the member shall be estimated based on cracked moment 
of inertia for the analysis. In case of RCC bridge piers, 75% of the gross 
moment of inertia may be considered as cracked moment of inertia, in the 
absence of detailed calculation. The gross section stiffness may be used 
for superstructures of bridges supported on bearings for seismic force 
computation. In the case of integral bridges it would be appropriate to 
use effective stiffness of superstructure duly considering the cracking of 
the section for seismic force estimation. The stiffness of superstructure in 
longitudinal and transverse directions would be normally different.
	
c.	
The time periods are calculated based on appropriate member stiffness. 
The time periods of the bridge in two principal horizontal directions 
that is longitudinal and transverse directions could be different due to 
different stiffness of substructure in two directions. Time period in vertical 
direction shall be obtained duly considering the stiffness of superstructure 
and its support condition, i.e., connection between superstructure and 
substructure.
	
d.	
Seismic Analysis shall be carried out by applicable methods as specified in 
Chapter-5. The elastic response analysis shall be carried out by considering 



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 146
======================================================================
46
IRC : SP:114-2018
as many modes to ensure the participation of 90% of the total mass. The 
response is then combined by appropriate method.
	
e.	
The response reduction factor corresponding to redundancy, assessed 
ductility and material of system is selected as specified in the code. The 
Design Seismic Forces are obtained by dividing Elastic Seismic Forces by 
Response Reduction Factor. It may be noted that the Response Reduction 
Factors in bridges as given in Chapter- 4 would be different for different 
components.
	
f.	
The locations where plastic hinges can form in the bridge are to be pre-
identified as per requirement of applying capacity design principles. The 
concept of strong beam weak column is normally followed for bridge seismic 
design with substructure consisting of single pier/column, multiple columns 
or framed substructure. In this design strategy, the plastic hinges will form at 
base or top of columns and not in beam/superstructure or foundations.
7.2.1	
Design Earthquake – DBE and MCE
All bridges shall be designed for Design Basis Earthquake (DBE). Bridges having design 
life more than 100 years shall be designed for both Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) and 
Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) for which specialist literature shall be referred.
7.2.2	
Ultimate Limit state
The limit state is defined as that condition of a structure at which it ceases to satisfy the 
provisions for which it was designed.
While designing for DBE, only Ultimate Limit State (ULS) shall be ensured and the load 
combinations and load factors, as specified in IRC: 6-2017 for Ultimate Limit State shall be 
considered.
Capacity Design Effects shall be treated as Ultimate Loads for which sections will be checked 
independently as per the procedure described below.
7.3	
Capacity Design
After completing the Force Based Design for seismic forces, following broad steps shall be 
followed for Capacity Design for members designed with ductile detailing.
	
a.	
The required design moment at potential locations of plastic hinges is 
determined for the load combinations specified in the code.
	
b.	
The structural design of the member sections at plastic hinge locations is 
then carried out following the limit state of design. The sections outside the 
plastic hinge are designed to remain elastic for capacity design effects and 
are detailed accordingly.
	
c.	
Longitudinal and transverse reinforcement is determined for combination of 
forces while following rules for ductile detailing.



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 146
======================================================================
47
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
d.	
The plastic hinge regions are detailed according to code recommendations 
to ensure that ductility demands in these regions are reliably accommodated. 
This is achieved by closely spaced and well anchored transverse 
reinforcement.
	
e.	
The final step in the design is to determine the forces in the members adjacent 
to plastic hinge which are to remain elastic, by capacity design procedure 
explained in the following section. This includes sections of pier outside the 
plastic hinge and the foundations.
7.3.1	
Definition
The Capacity Design is a philosophy for the design of ductile structures subjected to strong 
earthquakes which advocates a hierarchy in failure modes, giving priority to the ductile 
failure model (that allow larges deformations and more energy dissipation) and avoiding the 
occurrence of brittle failure model. This leads to endorsement of plastic hinges in the critical 
zones of structural elements and avoids brittle failure modes such as shear. The capacity 
design deals with the proportioning of strengths between ductile and non- ductile regions of 
the structure by design. Application of this concept for seismic design leads to high degree 
of protection against collapse of structure during an earthquake. The method is applicable to 
members designed for ductile behaviour where plastic hinges can form. For bridges designed 
with no ductile behaviour, the application of the capacity design procedure is not applicable.
7.3.2	
Capacity Design Principle
The capacity to resist and dissipate energy are related to the exploitation of the non- linear 
response.
In a structure designed to ensure ductile behaviour, the locations of plastic hinge regions are 
pre-selected to enable development of suitable plastic mechanism. The plastic hinge regions 
are then designed and detailed for adequate ductility.
All other regions are provided with additional strength called capacity design effects so that 
they remain elastic when the selected plastic hinges develop their over strength.
To provide adequate margin of strength between ductile and non-ductile failure modes, 
capacity design is achieved by providing over strength against seismic load in locations 
adjacent to plastic hinges, which are to essentially remain elastic. The shear resistance of 
plastic hinges, as well as both shear and flexural resistances of other regions, shall thus be 
designed to resist capacity design effects.
7.3.3	
Main Advantages of Capacity Design Method
Main advantage of the use of capacity design method are:
	
a)	
Plastic deformations can occur only at pre-determined locations.



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 146
======================================================================
48
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
b)	
A suitable mechanism for energy dissipation is deliberately and thoughtfully 
chosen by the designer.
	
c)	
A clear hierarchy in the required strength is established. Thereby regions 
intended to remain elastic are provided with strength (capacity) in excess of 
the over-strengths of the plastic regions.
	
d)	
Limitations for the locations where special detailing is required (i,e. in the 
potential plastic hinge regions).
7.3.4	
Capacity Design Steps
The following broad steps are required in capacity design:
7.3.4.1	
Determination of plastic hinge locations
Firstly, choose a complete and admissible plastic hinge mechanism(s) that can dissipate the 
energy; pre identify plastic hinge locations. In bridge piers these locations could be at pier 
base for cantilever piers or both at pier base and top for portal frame; this would depend upon 
restraint conditions at pier ends.
7.3.4.2	
Computation of capacity design effects
For structures with ductile behaviour, the design force demand, that is, capacity design effects 
Fc (Vc, Mc, Nc) for elastic elements adjacent to ductile elements would be determined from 
joint-force equilibrium condition, considering over strength moment Mo at the plastic hinge. 
Vc, Mc & Nc represent Capacity design shear, moment and axial force respectively.
	
(a)	
The over-strength moment Mo at plastic hinge location is given by:
	
Mo=γo MRd
Where:
γo is the over-strength factor
	
MRd	 is the plastic moment (design flexural strength) of the section, in the selected 
direction and sense, based on the actual section geometry, reinforcement 
and material properties (with γM values for load combinations of IRC:6-2017). 
In computing MRd, biaxial bending under the permanent effects and the 
seismic effects corresponding to the design seismic action in the selected 
direction and sense, shall be considered.
The plastic moment capacity of hinge, MRd should be greater than the seismic demand that 
is, the bending moment obtained from elastic analysis divided by response reduction factor.
	
(b)	
The value of the over-strength factor should reflect the probable deviation of 
material strength and strain hardening. Over-strength factors recommended 
are:
	
l	
Concrete members: γo= 1.35
	
l	
Steel members: γo = 1.25

For reinforced concrete sections with confining reinforcement provided as per provisions of 
IRC 112 and in which the value of the normalized axial force:
	
ηk = NEd/(Acƒck)>0.08,
the above over-strength factor shall be multiplied by a factor,
	
K = [1+2(ηk-0.08)2]
Where,
	
NEd	 is the value of the axial force at the plastic hinge location corresponding to 
the design seismic combination, positive if compressive
	
Ac	
is the area of cross section
	
ƒck	
is the characteristic concrete cube strength.
	
(c)	
The capacity design effect that is the capacity moment Mc and capacity shear 
Vc at any section of the pier outside the plastic hinge above the pier base 
can be determined from Fig. 7.2 which shows potential locations of plastic 
hinges in cantilever and frame type piers
	
	
In case of a cantilever pier the plastic hinge mechanism will form at the base 
of pier. The over strength moment, Mo at the base of pier is equal to plastic 
moment x over strength factor. The over strength bending moment diagram 
for the pier in this case is linear across the height with zero moment at the 
top and Mo at the base. Vc is obtained by dividing Mo by effective column 
height h.
	
	
In case of frame type pier, over strength bending moment diagram is shown 
in Fig 7.1 and Vc is obtained by sum of the over strength moment capacities 
at the top and bottom of pier divided by effective pier height h.
	
(d)	
Capacity Design Moment diagram Mc is illustrated in Fig. 7.1 below in 
case of frame type pier. In case of cantilever pier, Mc will be zero at top 
and maximum at base. Within members having plastic hinge(s), the capacity 
design moment Mc at the vicinity of the hinge (Fig 7.1) shall not be taken 
greater than the relevant design flexural resistance MRd of the nearest hinge.
	
	
A=Deck, B=Pier, P.H.=Plastic Hinge, ME=Design Moment in the seismic 
design Situation at plastic hinge location
The MRd curves shown in Fig. 7.1 correspond to a pier having variable cross section 
(increasing downwards). In case of pier with a uniform cross section and reinforcement, MRd 
is also uniform. For value of Lh, Refer IRC :112.

Fig. 7.1 Capacity Design Moments Mc within member containing Plastic Hinges
The illustrative example for capacity design is presented in Appendix A-3
	
(e)	
Capacity Design Shear force in Pier
	
	
To avoid a brittle shear failure, capacity design shear force Vc for pier shall 
be based on over strength moment capacities of the plastic hinges and is 
given by:
	
	
	
Vc= ΣMo/h
	
	
Where
	
	
ΣMo=Sum of the over strength moment capacities of the hinges resisting 
lateral loads, as detailed. In case of twin pier this would be the sum of the 
over strength moment capacities at the top and bottom of the column. For 
single stem piers the over strength moment capacity at the bottom should be 
used. 
	
	
h = Clear height of the column
	
(f)	
The capacity design effects need not be taken greater than the elastic design 
effects resulting from the design seismic combinations considered with 
Response Reduction factor, R=1.0
7.3.4.3	
Design for Capacity Design Effects
	
i.	
Proportion the structural members for design loads and detail plastic hinge 
region for ductility.
	
ii.	
The potentially brittle regions, or those components, adjacent to plastic 
hinge, are capacity protected by ensuring that their strength exceeds the 
demands originating from the over strength of plastic hinges. These regions 
are therefore designed to remain elastic. This approach enables traditional 
detailing of these elements such as designed for gravity loads and wind 
forces. The distinction is thus clearly made in the capacity design method 
with respect to nature of detailing for potentially plastic hinge regions and 



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 146
======================================================================
51
IRC : SP:114-2018
regions outside the hinge region which are to remain elastic.
	
iii.	
The capacity design effects should be calculated in the bridge separately for 
seismic action acting in each of the longitudinal and transverse directions.
	
iv.	
The foundation would be capacity protected by designing it for over strength 
moment, Mo at the base of pier. The pier, plastic hinge region and foundation 
are also designed to resist over strength shear, Vc =ΣMo/h, to avoid shear or 
anchorage failure. However, while checking foundations for base pressure 
and pile capacity, para 8 under Notes below Table B.4 shall be followed.
	
v.	
Bridge Piers with Elastomer Bearings:
	
	
In the bridge piers supporting elastomeric bearings and intended to have 
ductile behaviour, members where no plastic hinges are intended to form 
and which resist shear forces from the bearings shall be designed for the 
capacity design effects in bearings, that is, the maximum shear force that 
these bearings would transmit to the pier under seismic conditions. The 
capacity design effect in the bearing shall thus be calculated on the basis of 
maximum deformation of the bearings corresponding to design displacement 
of the deck and a bearing stiffness increased by 30%.
	
vi.	
Bridge Piers with Sliding Bearings:
	
	
When sliding bearing participate in the plastic mechanism, their capacity 
shall be assumed equal to γofRdf,
	
	
where:
	
	
γof = 1.30 is a magnification factor for friction due to ageing effects and Rdf is 
the maximum design friction force of the bearing.
7.4	
Structural Components to be Designed on the Basis of Capacity Design
The fixed bearings, connections and foundations would be designed to remain elastic under 
seismic conditions. These components should thus be designed for the forces determined from 
the capacity design effect estimated from equilibrium condition of the joint under reference.
Force demands on the foundations should be based on the plastic capacity of columns/
piers multiplied by over strength factor. Foundation elements should be designed to remain 
essentially elastic. When designed according to the capacity design principles, the nominal 
strength of the cap beam and foundation is greater than the over strength capacity, so that 
there is little or no damage to the cap beam and foundation. Pile foundations may experience 
limited inelastic deformation at their top. In such cases, these regions should be designed 
and detailed for ductility.
7.5	
Design of Concrete Sections with Ductile Detailing
7.5.1	
Seismic Design Force for Substructure

IRC : SP:114-2018
shall be adopted for supporting components of the bridge. Sections shall be checked for the 
following forces:
	
a.	
In a single-pier type substructure, maximum shear force that develops when 
the substructure has maximum moment that it can sustain (i.e., the over 
strength plastic moment capacity), the critical section is at the bottom of the 
column or pier as shown in Fig. 7.2(a) & 7.2(c).
	
b.	
In multiple-column frame type or multiple-pier type substructures, maximum 
shear force that is developed when plastic moment hinges are formed in the 
substructure so as to form a collapse mechanism, the critical sections are at 
the bottom and/or top of the columns/piers as shown in Fig. 7.2(b).
7.5.2	
Design of Plastic Hinge Regions
7.5.2.1	
Flexural Resistance of Section at plastic hinge location
	
Check
	
MEd ≤ MRd
Where,
	
MEd	 is the design moment under the seismic load combination, including second 
order effects.
	
MRd	 is the flexural resistance of the section as stated in clause 7.3.4.2 (a) above.
7.5.2.2	
Confinement
Where plastic hinge can occur, the detailing of confining reinforcement shall conform to 
provisions of Section 17 of IRC:112.
7.5.3	
Design of Components outside the region of Plastic Hinges
Once the position of the plastic hinges has been determined and these regions detailed 
to ensure a ductile performance, the structure between the plastic hinges is designed 
considering the capacity of the plastic hinges. The intention here is:
	
a.	
To reliably protect the bridge against collapse so that it will be available for 
service after a major shaking.
	
b.	
To localize structural damage to the plastic hinge regions where it can be 
controlled and repaired.
7.5.3.1	
Flexural Resistance of sections outside the region of plastic hinges
	
Check
	
MC ≤ MRd
where:



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 146
======================================================================
53
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
Mc	
is the capacity design moment as specified in 7.3.4 ( c) above
	
MRd	 is the design flexural resistance of the section in accordance with provisions 
of IRC:112, taking into account the interaction of the corresponding design 
effects (axial force and, when applicable, bending moment in the other 
direction) as already stated in Clause 7.3.4.2 (a).
7.5.3.2	
Shear Resistance of members outside the region of plastic hinges
7.5.3.2.1	 Check for shear resistance shall be carried out as per the section 10 of IRC:112 
with following additional rules :
	
a)	
The design shear force shall be taken equal to the capacity design shear in 
accordance with Clause 7.3.4 above.
	
b)	
The resistance values, VRd,C, VRd,S and VRd,max derived in accordance with 
section 10 of IRC:112 shall be reduced by dividing by the additional safety 
factor γBd against brittle failure. Following value of γBd shall be used.
	
	
1 ≤ γBd = γBd1 +1- R.VEd ≤ γBd1 
                             VC
Where,
	
γBd1	 shall be taken as 1.25
	
VEd	 is the maximum value of the shear under the seismic combination as per 
IRC:6
	
Vc	
is the capacity design shear determined in accordance with Clause 7.3.4.2 ,
However without considering the limitation of Clause 7.3.4.2 (f).
7.5.3.2.2	 For circular concrete sections of radius r where the longitudinal reinforcement 
is distributed over a circle with radius rs, and in the absence of a rigorous assessment, the 
effective depth
	
de = +
r
2rs
π
	
may be used instead of ‘d’ in the relevant expression for the shear resistance. The 
value of internal lever arm ‘z’ may be assumed to be z = 0.9de.
7.5.4	
Shear resistance of plastic hinges
	
a)	
Clause 7.5.3.2.1 is applicable.
	
b)	
The angle θ between concrete compression strut and the main tension chord 
shall be assumed to be equal to 45o.
	
c)	
The dimension of the confined concrete core to the centre line of the perimeter 
hoop shall be used in lieu of the section dimension ‘bw’ and ‘d’.
	
d)	
Clause 7.5.3.2.2 may be applied on the dimensions of the confined concrete

core.
	
e)	
For members with shear span ratio αs< 2.0, check of the pier section against 
diagonal tension and sliding failure should be carried out in accordance with 
section 10 of IRC:112. In these checks, the capacity design effects should be 
used as design action effects.
Where :
	
αs =	 Ls/h is the shear span ratio of the pier.
	
Ls =	 distance from the plastic hinge to the point of zero moment.
	
h =	 depth of cross section in the direction of flexure of the plastic hinge.
7.6	
Second Order Effects
For linear analysis, approximate methods may be used for estimating the influence of second 
order effects on the critical sections (plastic hinges).
In the absence of a more accurate procedure, the increase in bending moments of the plastic 
hinge section due to second order effects may be assumed to be equal to:
	
Δ M ≅ 1+R dEd NEd
                               2
Where NEd is the axial force and dEd is the relative transverse displacement of the ends of the 
ductile member under consideration and R is response reduction factor.
7.7	
Design of Joints
Beam-column joints should be designed properly to resist the forces caused by axial loads, 
bending and shear forces in the joining members. Forces in the joint should be determined by 
considering a free body of the joint with the forces on the joint member boundaries properly 
represented.
The joint shear strength should be entirely provided by transverse reinforcement. Where the 
joint is not confined adequately (i.e. where minimum pier and pile cap width is less than three 
column diameters) the special confinement requirement should be satisfied.
7.8	
General Procedure for Calculation of Capacity Design Effects
	
i)	
Design the concrete sections of substructure & foundation for loading 
combinations given in IRC:6-2017 as per provisions of IRC:112 in usual 
manner.
	
ii)	
Calculate MRd , design flexural strength of the section at location of plastic 
hinge as stated in para 7.3.4.2 (a) separately for each of two horizontal 
components of the design seismic action.



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 146
======================================================================
55
IRC : SP:114-2018
	
iii)	
Calculate Mo=Over-strength moment of section at location of plastic hinge as 
stated in para 7.3.4.2 (a) & (b).
	
iv)	
Calculate Capacity design moment Mc and shear Vc from over-strength 
bending moment diagram as stated in para 7.3.4.2 (c ), (d) & ( e). These 
capacity design effects are to be treated as ultimate effects and sections 
beyond plastic hinges only need to be checked for these effects independently 
after having completed the design as in para (i) above. The capacity design 
moments and shears obtained as above are mainly due to seismic effects 
with small permanent effects.
	
(v)	
In case of significant permanent effects compared to seismic effects such as 
due to earth pressure on abutments and substantial hydrodynamic and water 
current forces on substructure, the following procedure may be adopted.
	
a)	
Calculate the variation of action effects ΔAc (moment or shear) of the 
plastic mechanism, caused by the increase of the moments of the 
plastic hinges (ΔM), from the values due to the permanent actions (MG) 
to over-strength moment Mo of the sections.
	
	
ΔM = Mo- MG
	
	
Where Mo is as stated Clause 7.3.4.2 .
	
b)	
The effects ΔAc may in general be estimated from equilibrium 
conditions while reasonable approximations regarding the compatibility 
of deformations are acceptable.
	
c)	
The final capacity design effects Ac shall be obtained by superimposing 
the variation ΔAc to the permanent action effects AG.
	
	
AC = AG + ΔAC

CHAPTER 8
DESIGN OF BRIDGE COMPONENTS
8.1	
General
This chapter explains the procedure for seismic design of various bridge components such 
as superstructure, substructure, foundations, bearing and expansion joints. Superstructure 
shall be checked for vertical seismic along with other load. Transfer of force mechanism from 
bearing to substructure and foundation has also been covered under this Chapter.
This chapter deals with the earthquake resistant design of regular bridges in which the 
seismic actions are mainly resisted at abutments or through flexure of piers, that is, bridges 
comprising of conventional pier-foundation system supporting the deck structure with/without 
bearings. However for all special and major bridges, detailed dynamic studies should be 
carried out as mentioned in Chapter 6
8.2	
Superstructure
The superstructure shall be designed for the design seismic forces calculated based on 
various analysis methods specified in Chapter 6 in combination with other appropriate loads. 
The effect of vertical seismic component is particularly important in Superstructure and needs 
to be investigated in situations mentioned in clause 5.3 under “General Design Provisions”.
Under simultaneous action of horizontal and vertical accelerations, the superstructure shall 
be checked for equilibrium in accordance with Table B.1 of IRC:6.
The superstructure shall be secured, where necessary, to the substructure, particularly in 
seismic zones IV and V and in the near fault zones. Vertical hold-down devices may be 
provided to secure superstructure against uplift wherever necessary. Anti-dislodging elements 
in horizontal direction shall be provided in seismic zone IV and V and near fault zones.
These vertical hold down devices and/or anti-dislodging elements may also be used to secure 
the suspended spans, if any, with the restrained portions of the superstructure. The frictional 
forces shall not be relied upon in the design of these hold-down devices or anti-dislodging 
elements.
8.3	
Substructures: Piers and Abutments
8.3.1	
The substructure shall be designed for seismic forces calculated based on 
seismic analysis method specified in Chapter 6. The conceptual design and geometry of the 
substructure shall be based on the provision given in Chapter 4. The calculation of time period 
shall be considered keeping in view the geometry of superstructure, substructure, foundation 
and connection between substructure and superstructure. The effect of both horizontal and 
vertical component of seismic needs to be investigated for all possible combination as per 
the provision given in Chapter 5 “General Design Provisions”.



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 146
======================================================================
58
IRC : SP:114-2018
8.3.2	
Force transfer mechanism from bearing to abutment and pier 
The transfer of force through connection between substructure and superstructure is 
an important aspect in design of substructure. The connections between supporting and 
supported members shall be designed in order to ensure structural integrity and avoid 
unseating under extreme seismic displacements. The piers shall be designed to withstand 
shear forces corresponding to the pier’s plastic hinge capacity. The maximum induced shear 
in the piers shall be limited to the plastic hinge moment (or moments) divided by the height 
of pier as ascertained in Chapters 4 and 7.
For Seismic Zone IV and V, use of elastomeric bearings for resisting horizontal seismic 
actions by shear deformation, shall not be permitted. In such cases PoT, POT Cum PTFE and 
Spherical Bearings shall be adopted over elastomeric bearings for resisting seismic loads.
In seismic design, the fixed bearing shall be checked for full seismic force along with braking 
/ tractive force, ignoring the relief due to frictional forces in other free bearings. The structure 
under the fixed bearing shall be designed to withstand the full seismic and design braking / 
tractive force.
8.3.3	
Load Combination
For design of substructure, the seismic force shall be assumed to act from any horizontal 
direction. For this purpose, two separate analyses shall be performed for design seismic 
forces acting along two orthogonal horizontal directions. The design seismic force resultants 
at any cross-section of a bridge component resulting from the analysis in the two orthogonal 
horizontal directions shall be combined as per Clause 4.2.2
8.3.4	
Vertical component of seismic action
The effect of the vertical seismic component on substructure and foundation may be omitted 
in zones II and III. The vertical accelerations should be specially considered in bridges with 
large spans, those in which stability is the criteria of design and in situation where bridges 
are located close to epicentre.
However, the effect of vertical seismic component is particularly important in the following 
components/situation and needs to be investigated for bridges in all seismic zones.
	
a)	
Prestressed concrete components,
	
b)	
Bearings and linkages,
	
c)	
Horizontal cantilever structural elements, and
	
d)	
Situations where stability (overturning/sliding) becomes critical.
8.3.5	
Seismic Design Force for substructure
The seismic design of substructure and transfer of seismic forces shall be adopted as given in 
Chapters 7. The bridge substructure shall be conceptualised in such a manner to ensure that 
intended configuration of plastic hinges should avoid the brittle failure mode of the structure 
under seismic action. This can be achieved by using capacity design principal.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 146
======================================================================
59
IRC : SP:114-2018
Effects of abutment flexibility shall be considered in the seismic analysis and design of all 
bridges. Bridge inertial forces shall be based on its structural capacity and the soil resistance 
that can be reliably mobilized.
Skewed abutments are highly vulnerable to damage during seismic actions. For bridges with 
skew angles more than 30 degrees, the skew angle at piers and abutments shall preferably 
be reduced, even at the expense of increasing the bridge length if possible. For bridges 
having skew angle ≥ 30 degree and horizontally curved radius ≤ 100m, special studies shall 
be performed and provision given Table 2.1 shall be followed.
The energy dissipation capacity of the abutments should be considered for bridges whose 
response is dominated by the abutments.
Provisions given in Chapter 9 for ductile detailing of members subjected to seismic forces 
shall be adopted for design of supporting components of the bridge. Further, the design 
shear force at the critical sections of substructures shall be the lower of the following:
	
a)	
Maximum elastic shear force at the critical section of the bridge component 
divided by the response reduction factor for the components as per 
Table 4.1.
	
b)	
Maximum shear force that develops when the substructure has maximum 
moment that it can sustain (i.e., the over strength plastic moment capacity) 
in single column or singlepier type substructure.
	
c)	
Maximum shear force that is developed when plastic moment hinges are 
formed in the substructure so as to form a collapse mechanism in multiple 
column frame type or multiple-pier type substructures, in which the plastic 
moment capacity shall be the over strength plastic moment capacity.
8.3.6	
Verification of strength of piers and abutments under Seismic Load Combination 
Serviceability Limit State (SLS) checks need not be performed for Seismic Load Combinations. 
Under ULS, strength and stability are to be ensured under Seismic Load Combination.
For checking the equilibrium of substructure, and structural strength different partial safety 
factor  are specified for different load combinations, for which Table B.1 and B.2 of Annex – B 
of IRC: 6 shall be referred.
In general, the compliance criteria stated above aim explicitly at satisfying the non-collapse 
requirement in conjunction with certain specific detailing rules, the same criteria are deemed 
to cover implicitly the damage minimization requirement as well.
8.4	
Foundation
8.4.1	
General
Performance of bridge structure is highly dependent on foundation system. The content of 
this section will establish the criteria for design of bridge foundation under the prevailing soil 
condition with the provision of most suitable type of foundation.

IRC : SP:114-2018
8.4.2	
Seismic action
The seismic action shall be governed by the basic concepts and data requirements as given 
below;
	
i)	
Geotechnical or geological data shall be available in sufficient detail to allow 
the determination of an average ground type and / or the associated response 
spectrum.
	
ii)	
Correlation of In-situ data with data from adjacent area of similar geological 
characteristics.
	
iii)	
Existing seismic micro zonation maps and special criteria/requirements 
which are supported by ground investigation.
	
iv)	
For special long span bridges, the profile for shear wave velocity (Vs) in 
the ground shall be regarded as the most reliable tool of site dependent 
characteristics for determining the seismic action.
8.4.3	
Design of bridge foundation & soil requirements
8.4.3.1	
Design of bridge foundation under seismic condition is dependent on underlying 
soil conditions. The assessment shall be carried out to determine nature of supporting 
ground to ensure that hazards of rupture, slope stability, liquefaction and high densification 
susceptibility in the event of an earthquake are minimised.
8.4.3.2	
Important bridges preferably shall not be constructed in the immediate vicinity of 
faults. Special investigations and detailed studies shall be carried out for important structures 
to be constructed near potentially active faults as mention in Clause 2.6.
8.4.3.3	
Slope stability
A verification of ground stability shall be carried out for structure to be constructed on or near 
natural or artificial slopes to ensure the safely and/or serviceability of the structure under 
design earthquake. The response of ground slopes to design earthquake shall be calculated 
either by dynamic analysis such as finite elements or rigid block models or by simplified static 
methods.
8.4.3.4	
Design & Analysis of Foundations
The following method of analysis for foundations shall be adopted:
	
i)	
In modelling, the behaviour of soil media, the possible effects of pore water 
pressure increase under cyclic loading shall be taken into account for which 
reference to special literature shall be made.
	
ii)	
For equilibrium and for base pressure check of foundation, reference shall 
be made to IRC : 78. Table B.4 of Annexure B of IRC: 6 shall be referred for 
structural design of foundation under ULS.

IRC : SP:114-2018
	
iii)	
Safety against overturning and sliding shall be checked as per relevant 
clause of IRC : 78.
	
iv)	
No reduction in shear strength need to be applied for strongly dilatant 
cohesion less soil such as dense sand.
	
v)	
Liquefaction may occur in case of saturated cohesion-less soil during 
earthquake vibration. The liquefaction potential of sites liable to liquefy 
should be estimated as given in Appendix A-5. The remedial measures for 
liquefaction should be undertaken, if feasible. The structural design of bridge 
may be modified if required on account of these effects.
8.4.4	
Potentially liquefiable soils
	
i)	
A decrease in the shear strength and /or stiffness caused by the increase 
in pore water pressure in saturated cohesion less soil during earthquake 
ground motion, such as to give rise to significant permanent deformation or 
even a condition of near zero effective stress in the soil shall be referred to 
as liquefaction.
	
ii)	
An evaluation of the liquefaction susceptibility shall be done when foundation 
soils include layers of loose sands with or without silt/clay fines, beneath

iii)	
Investigations required for this purpose shall be minimum include the in-situ 
Standard Penetration Test (SPT) or Core Penetration Test (CPT) as well as 
determination of grain size distribution curve in the laboratory.
	
iv)	
The evaluation of a liquefaction susceptibility may be omitted when saturated 
sandy soil are found at depth greater than 20 m from ground surface.
	
v)	
The liquefaction hazards may be neglected when at least one of the following 
conditions is fulfilled.
	
a.	
The sands have a clay content greater than 25% with Plasticity Index 
PI>10
	
b.	
The sands have silt contents greater than 35% and corrected N value 
more than 20
	
c.

geotechnical engineering and as per methods given in Appendix A-5 of this 
guidelines.
	
vii)	
Ground improvement against liquefaction should either to compact the soil 
to increase its penetration on resistance or use drainage to reduce the 
excess pore water pressure generated by ground shaking. The feasibility of 
ground improvement is mainly governed by the fines content and depth of 
the soil.

viii)	 The use of pile foundation should be considered with caution due to large 
force induced in piles by loss of soils support in liquefiable layers.
8.4.5	
Excessive settlement of soil under cyclic loads
The excessive settlement may occur during seismic activities. The following consideration 
shall be taken in design to avoid excessive settlement of foundations:-
	
i)	
The susceptibility of foundation soil densification and excessive settlement 
caused by earthquake induced cyclic stresses shall be taken into account 
when extended layers of thick loose cohesionless material exist at shallow 
depth.
	
ii)	
If the settlement caused by densification or cyclic degradation affects, ground 
improvements methods for stability of shallow foundation.
8.4.6	
Foundation Systems
8.4.6.1	
General Requirements
	
i)	
The forces from foundation shall be transferred to the ground without 
substantial permanent deformation of founding soil.
	
ii)	
The seismically induced ground deformations are compatible with functional 
requirement of the structure.
	
iii)	
The seismic action effects for foundation structure shall be based on capacity 
design consideration accounting for over strength factor.
8.4.6.2	
Design Aspects for foundation system
	
i)	
The foundation shall be stiff enough to uniformly transmit the localized action 
received from superstructure to the ground.
	
ii)	
The evaluation of bearing capacity of soil under seismic loading should take 
into account strength and stiffness degradation mechanism which may start 
at low strain levels.
	
iii)	
The rise of pore water pressure under cyclic loading should be taken into 
account either by considering its effects on undrained strength (in total stress 
analysis) or on pore pressure (in effective stress analysis).
	
iv)	
For special long span structure such as cable stay & extradosed type bridge 
foundations, non-linear soil behaviour should be taken into account in 
determining possible permanent deformation during earthquake.
	
v)	
For pile foundation analysis should be carried out to determine internal forces 
along the pile along with deflection and rotation at pile head. This shall be 
based on discrete model that can realistically reproduce.
	
a)	
Flexure stiffness of pile
	
b)	
Soil structure interaction
	
c)

vi)	
The side resistance of soil layers that are susceptible to liquefaction or 
the substantial strength degradation shall be ignored. The effect of large 
force induced in piles by loss of soil support in liquefiable layers shall be 
considered.
	
vii)	
Pile should in ideally be designed to remain elastic, but may under special 
circumstances be allowed to develop plastic hinge at their heads.
	
viii)	 Spread foundations such as footing, rafts, box/circular caissons shall not fall 
into the plastic hinge range under the design seismic action.
8.5	
Bearings, Seismic Connections and Expansion Joints
8.5.1	
General
Bearing is a device placed over the substructure to support the superstructure and effectively 
transmit the loads and forces between these two components. Bearings may also be provided 
at articulation joints for suspended spans as well as central hinge bearing of superstructure. 
Free bearings are designed to transmit vertical load and allow movements caused due to 
thermal effects, shrinkage effects, creep effects, braking forces, other seismic as well as 
non-seismic effects etc. Whereas, Restrained and Fixed bearings are designed to transmit 
horizontal forces in addition to vertical loads from superstructure to the substructure.
Seismic Connections are devices that are provided in addition to bearings, wherever required. 
Seismic connections such as Metallic Pin and Guide bearing, Seismic Reaction Blocks, 
Seismic Links, etc. are provided to connect superstructure with sub-structure through them 
for specific purpose of seismic force transfer in a specific manner. Reaction Blocks include 
vertical concrete upstands from the respective pier cap with vertical elastomeric bearing 
sandwiched between superstructure and the concrete upstands, Shear Key, Longitudinal 
Restrainer etc. Seismic Links include Cable Restrainers, Linkage Bots, etc and are generally 
used for retrofitting purposes.
Expansion joints are provided to bridge the gap between the two adjacent spans of 
superstructures or between abutment and superstructure, simultaneously allowing for 
movements. Expansion Joints shall avoid leakage of water.
8.5.2	
Bearing
All bearings may need replacement during service life of the bridge, as these have shorter 
service life than that of the bridge.
Bearings may be designed to cater to the seismic forces, in addition to the vertical and 
horizontal non seismic forces. However, in seismic zones IV & V, it may not always be feasible 
to design the bearings for the applicable minimum and maximum vertical load in combination 
of horizontal forces due to comparatively large magnitude of seismic effects. In such cases, 
the vertical load carrying bearings may be designed only for vertical loads and movements 
and suitable seismic devices may be provided to cater to the horizontal forces. These may be 
in the form of Pin or Guide Bearings, Reaction Blocks or any other acceptable arrangement.

8.5.2.1	
Bearing Arrangements in Seismic Zones IV & V
Following arrangements for different types of the commonly used bearings shall be 
incorporated in the bridges, appropriately:
	
i)	
Longitudinal Direction
	
a.	
In case of simply supported superstructure supported on elastomeric 
bearings, 
where 
elastomeric 
bearings, 
without 
in-built 
fixity 
arrangements are provided, separate Seismic Reaction Blocks or Pins 
for carrying the horizontal forces shall be provided at all longitudinally 
restrained bearing locations. Seismic Reaction Blocks shall be provided 
with sufficient slack to accommodate movement of the free elastomeric 
bearings, as appropriate. These Seismic Reaction Blocks shall be 
designed for full capacity design forces ignoring any force shared by 
other bearings. Fig. 8.3 a) for illustrations.
	
b.	
At restrained bearing location, elastomeric bearing without in-built fixity 
arrangements shall not be used as fixed bearing. The restrained bearing 
(elastomeric bearing with in-built fixity arrangement also permitted as 
restrained bearing) shall be designed for capacity design forces. And, 
additional seismic Reaction Blocks shall be provided for additional 
safety, which shall be designed with R value same as that for the pier 
or abutment, as the case may be. Fig. 8.3 b) for illustrations.
	
c.	
Alternative to the b) above at restrained piers, the vertical load carrying 
bearing may be free in longitudinal direction, in which case Seismic 
Reaction Blocks shall be designed to carry the capacity design forces 
for the entire horizontal force. Fig. 8.3 c) for illustrations.
	
d.	
In case of integral bridges or semi-integral bridges or where at least one 
pier is monolithic with the superstructure in a continuous superstructure 
module, requirements of fixity of a), b) & c) above don’t apply. In this 
case, the piers with bearings may be provided with any appropriate type 
of bearings, with or without Reaction Blocks for Transfer of transverse 
horizontal forces.
	
ii)	
Transverse Direction
	
a.	
At all longitudinally free or restrained bearing locations (simply 
supported or continuous superstructure) Seismic Reaction Blocks shall 
be provided in transverse direction at each pier location. In case the 
vertical load carrying bearing is transversely free or in an elastomeric 
bearing, without in-built fixity arrangements, Seismic Reaction Blocks 
shall be designed for capacity design forces. In case transversely 
restrained bearings (elastomeric bearings with in-built fixity arrangement 
also permitted as restrained bearing) are provided at longitudinally free 
piers, these bearings shall be designed for capacity design forces and

IRC : SP:114-2018
separate seismic attachments, designed with R value same as that for 
the pier, shall be provided for additional safety. Fig. 8.3 for illustrations.
	
b.	
The requirements of a) above also apply to the longitudinally free 
piers of framed type bridges where at least one pier is monolithic with 
superstructure.

IRC : SP:114-2018
8.5.2.2	
Restrained Bearings
In Seismic zones IV & V, the design seismic actions on Restrained bearings shall be determined 
as for capacity design. Restrained bearings may be designed solely for the effects of the 
design seismic combinations, provided that they can be replaced without difficulty and that 
seismic reaction blocks are provided for additional safety which are designed with R value 
same as for the pier/ abutment, as the case may be.
8.5.2.3	
Free Bearings
Free bearings shall accommodate, without damage, the total design seismic displacement, 
in addition to displacements due to other applicable effects.
8.5.2.4	
Elastomeric Bearings
For use of elastomeric bearings reference to Chapter 3 shall be made. The elastomeric bearing 
used as part of Seismic reaction Block shall invariably have to be provided with attachments 
to keep it in position, as these are oriented vertically. The design of such elastomeric bearings 
need not be checked for minimum pressure criteria of IRC:83.
8.5.2.5	
Minimum overlap lengths
Where relative displacement between supported and supporting members is anticipated 
under seismic conditions, a minimum overlap length between the two shall be provided. 
This overlap shall be such as to ensure that the function of the support is maintained under 
extreme seismic displacements.
8.5.2.5.1	 At an end support on an abutment or end pier the minimum overlap length Lov may 
be estimated as follows:
	
Lov = lm + deg + des
	
Where deg = εsLeff < 2dg
	
εs = 2dg/ Lg
	
lm is the minimum support length = 40 cm
	
deg is the effective displacement of the two parts due to different seismic ground 
displacement,
	
dg is the design value of the peak ground displacement = 0.025αgSTCTD
	
Lg is the distance beyond which ground motion may be considered uncorrelated; 
taken as 500 m
	
αg is the ground acceleration
	
S is the soil factor
	
TC is the upper limit of the period of the constant part of the spectral acceleration
	
= 0.4 for Type I (Rock or Hard Soil) N > 30

IRC : SP:114-2018
	
= 0.5 for Type II (Medium Soil)
	
= 0.65 for Type III (Soft Soil) N < 10
TD is the value defining the beginning of the constant displacement response range of the 
spectrum =2.0
When the bridge site is at a distance less than 5 km form a known seismically active fault, 
capable to produce a seismic event of magnitude ≥ 6.5, the value of deg estimated above 
shall be doubled. Leff is the effective length of deck, taken as the distance from the deck joint 
in question to the nearest fixed pier (fixed bearing or STU or seismic link). If the deck is fixed 
(fixed bearing or STU or seismic link) at more than one pier, then Leff shall be taken as the 
distance between support and the center of the group of such fixed piers.
des is the effective seismic displacement of the support due to the deformation of the structure, 
estimated as follows:
	
l 
For decks fixed at piers either monolithically or through fixed bearings,
	
des = dED, where dEd is the total longitudinal design seismic displacement,
	
dEd = dE + dg + 0.50dT
	
where dE = design seismic displacement
	
	
dg = long term displacement due to permanent and quasi-permanent actions 
(eg. posttensioning, shrinkage and creep of concrete)
	
dT = displacement due to thermal movements
	
ψ2 = combination factor for quasi-permanent value of thermal action
	
l 
For decks connected to piers or to an abutment through seismic links with 
slack equal to ‘s’:
	
des = dEd + s
8.5.2.5.2	 In case of an intermediate separation joint between two sections of the deck lov, 
shall be estimated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the values calculated 
for each of the two sections of the deck as above. In the case of an end support of a deck 
section on an intermediate pier, lov should be estimated as above and increased by the 
maximum seismic displacement of the top of the pier dE.
8.5.3	
Seismic Connections
8.5.3.1	
Seismic Reaction Block
Seismic Reaction Blocks shall be provided between adjacent sections of the superstructure 
at supports and expansion joints. Anti-dislodgement elements like seismic reaction blocks 
and seismic arrestors shall be designed for the level of forces as defined in para 8.5.2.1 
above.

8.5.3.2	
Seismic Links
Usually, Seismic links are considered to be part of retrofitting measures. Seismic links shall 
be provided with proper slack so as to allow the non-seismic displacements of the bridge. 
These may be used to transmit the entire design seismic action provided that potential shock 
effects are adequately prevented.
In the latter case the analysis for the seismic action shall be based on an appropriate model 
taking into account a linear approximation of the force-displacement relationship of the linked 
structure (Fig. 8.5).

Seismic links may consist of shear key arrangements, buffers, dampers and/ or 
linkage bolts or cable. Friction connections are not considered as positive linkage.
	
Seismic links may be required in the following cases:
	
a.	
In combination with elastomeric bearings, if necessary, in order to carry the 
design seismic action (Fig. 8.6).

The design actions for the seismic links of the previous paragraph shall be determined as 
follows:
	
l	
In cases (a) and (b) as capacity design effects (the horizontal resistance of 
the bearings shall be assumed zero).
	
l	
In case (c) and (d), in the absence of a rational analysis taking into account 
the dynamic interaction of the deck(s) and the supporting elements, the 
linkage elements may be designed for an action equal to aQ where a= ag/g, 
with ag the design ground acceleration, Q the weight of the section of the 
deck linked to a pier or abutment, or in case of two deck sections linked 
together, the lesser of the two weights.

When using seismic links, means for reducing shock effects should be provided.
8.5.3.3	
Holding-Down Devices
8.5.3.3.1	 Vertical Hold-Down Devices
Vertical hold-down devices shall be provided at all supports (or hinges in continuous structures), 
where resulting vertical force U due to the maximum elastic horizontal and vertical seismic 
forces (combined as per relevant clause of the Code) opposes and exceeds 50% of the dead 
load reaction D. Refer Fig. 8.10 for typical details of holdingdown bars.

Where vertical force U, due to the combined effect of maximum elastic

be designed for a minimum net upward force of 10% of the downward dead 
load reaction that would be exerted if the span were simply supported.
	
b.	
If the vertical force U, due to the combined effect of maximum horizontal 
and vertical seismic forces, opposes and exceeds 100% of the dead load 
reaction D, then the device shall be designed for a net upward force of 1.2 
(U-D); however, it shall not be less than 10% of the downward dead load 
reaction that would be exerted if the span were simply supported.

Shock Transmission Units (STUs)
In case of large continuous bridge superstructure units associated with single restrained pier, 
it becomes extremely difficult to transfer all the longitudinal forces (including seismic forces) 
to one restrained pier. At the same time, providing longitudinally restrained bearings over 
more than one pier within one continuous superstructure unit poses the problem of enormous 
locked in forces in the substructure and foundation due to creep, shrinkage and thermal 
movements.
In such circumstances, it may be desirable to provide some or all free with STUs which, 
once provided, start sharing the quick acting forces, such as breaking/tractive and seismic 
movements. In such cases, the STUs at free piers get locked during the quick acting forces 
and the relevant free piers act as temporary restrained piers. Fig 8.12 depicts one such 
arrangement.
Shock Transmission Units (STUs) are devices which provide velocity-dependent restraint of 
the relative displacement between the deck and the supporting element (pier or abutment), 
as follows:
For low velocity movements (v < 0.1 mm/sec), such as those due to temperature effects or 
creep and shrinkage of the deck, the movement is practically free (with very low reaction). 
For high velocity movements (v > 1.0 mm/sec), such as those due to seismic or braking 
actions, the movement is blocked and the device acts practically as restrained connection.

Fig. 8.12 Details of STU
Full description of the required behavior of the STUs (force-displacement and force-velocity 
relationships) shall be available at the design stage (from the manufacturer of the units), 
including any influence of environmental factors (mainly temperature, ageing, cumulative 
travel) on this behaviour. All parameters necessary for the behavior of the STUs (including 
the values of movements, as well as the geometric data) shall also be made available. Such 
information shall be based on appropriate authenticated test results.
When STUs without force limiting function are used to resist seismic forces, they shall have 
a design resistance, FRd, as follows:
	
l	
For ductile bridges: FRd should be not less than the reaction corresponding to 
the capacity design effects,
	
l	
For limited ductile bridges: FRd should be not less than the reaction due 
to the design seismic action from the analysis, multiplied by the Response 
Reduction Factor used.
All STUs shall be accessible for inspection and maintenance/ replacement.
8.5.5	
Expansion Joints
The design of expansion joint is based on its movement capacity. The expansion joint 
movements should be considered in seismic combinations, as per Table B.2 of Annexure ‘B’ 
of IRC:6-2017 with appropriate value of ‘R’.

CHAPTER 9
DUCTILE DETAILING OF STRUCTURES
9.1	
Ductile Detailing of Reinforced Concrete Structures
9.1.1	
General
The detailing rules given have been chosen with the intention that reliable plastic hinges 
should form at the top and bottom of each pier column (in case of portal frame), or at the 
bottom only of a single cantilever pier under seismic action and that the bridge should remain 
elastic between the hinges.
Design strategy to be used is based on assumption that the plastic response will occur in the 
substructure, where repair of plastic hinges post-earthquake is relatively easy. However, in 
case of a wall type substructure supported on pile foundations, plastic hinge may not form in 
the substructure, refer Fig. 7.1 in Chapter 7.
The aim is to achieve a reliable ductile behavior of the structure by providing adequate local 
and overall structural ductility. The provisions of this clause will be applicable for all bridges 
in seismic zone III, IV and V where plastic hinges are likely to be formed.
9.1.2	
Specification
9.1.2.1	
Minimum grade of concrete in RCC components, where plastic hinge is likely to 
form shall be M30 (fck = 30 MPa).
9.1.2.2	
High strength deformed steel bars having elongation equal to or more than 
14.5 percent and conforming to the requirements of IS 1786 shall be used in the structure, 
particularly in plastic zone.
9.1.3	
Layout
9.1.3.1	
The use of circular column or square column is preferred for better plastic hinge 
performance.
9.1.3.2	
The bridge component should be proportioned and detailed by the designer so 
that plastic hinges occur only at the controlled locations (e.g., pier column ends) and not in 
other uncontrolled places.
9.1.4	
Longitudinal Reinforcement in Plastic Hinge Region
9.1.4.1	
The area of the longitudinal reinforcement shall not be less than 1.0 percent 
nor more than 4 percent, of the gross cross section area Ag. Splicing of flexural 



======================================================================

IRC : SP:114-2018
reinforcement is not permitted in the plastic hinge region. Laps shall not be located within 
plastic hinge region.
9.1.4.2	
Curtailment of longitudinal reinforcement in piers due to reduction in seismic 
bending moment towards top shall conform to provisions of Section 17 of IRC:112.
9.1.5	
Transverse Reinforcement
9.1.5.1	
The transverse reinforcement for circular columns shall consist of spiral or circular 
hoops. Continuity of these reinforcements should be provided by either of the following way 
as shown in (Fig. 9.1(a) or 9.1.(b)):
	
a.	
Welding, where the minimum length of weld should be 12 bar diameter, and 
the minimum weld throat thickness should be 0.4 times the bar diameter.
	
b.	
Lapping, where the minimum length of lap should be 30 bar diameters and 
each end of the bar anchored with 1350 hooks with a 10 diameter extension 
into the confined core.
9.1.5.2	
In rectangular columns, rectangular hoops may be used. A rectangular hoop is a 
closed stirrup, having a 135º hook with a 10 diameter extension at each end that is embedded 
in the confined core. Reference shall be made to Fig. 9.1 (a), (b)
9.1.6	
Special Confining Reinforcement in Piers:
Where plastic hinge can occur, the detailing of confining reinforcement shall conform to

Ductile Detailing of Steel and Steel Composite Structures
9.2.1	
General
	
i.	
Steel is a ductile material by nature; however, compression zones require 
detailing to avoid premature buckling and the joints require proper detailing 
to avoid failure at loads less than the capacity of the section, since the framed 
joints even at working loads are likely to be in plastic or semi plastic range. 
This will ensure overall ductile behaviour of the structure.
	
ii.	
Steel members shall be so designed and detailed as to give them adequate 
strength, stability and ductility to resist severe earthquakes in all seismic 
zones classified in IRC:6 without collapse.

iii.	
The provisions of this section apply only to steel and composite bridges 
designed as per IRC:22 and IRC:24 for ductile behaviour so as to ensure a 
minimum level of curvature/rotation ductility at the plastic hinges and ductility 
of tension braces.
	
iv.	
When ductile detailing is being followed, only plastic and compact sections 
shall be used in potential plastic hinge formation zone.
	
v.	
Ductile detailing shall be carried out for bridges located in zones III, IV and V 
of seismic map as given chapter 4.
	
vi.	
Members forming part of a gravity load resisting system and not intended to 
resist the lateral earthquake loads need not satisfy the requirements of this 
section, provided they can accommodate the resulting deformation without 
premature failure.
9.2.2	
Systems to Resist Seismic Forces
Various type of systems used to resist the seismic force can be broadly classified into following 
categories:
	
i)	
Braced Frame Systems: In such frames, lateral forces are mainly resisted 
by axial forces in members. These can broadly be categorised in following 
types:
	
a)	
Ordinary Concentrically Braced Frames (OCBF)
	
b)	
Special Concentrically Braced Frame (SCBF)
	
c)	
Eccentrically Braced Frame (EBF)
	
ii)	
Moment Frame System: In such frames, lateral forces are mainly resisted by 
flexural action in members. These can broadly be categorised in following 
types:
	
a)	
Ordinary Moment Frame (OMF)
	
b)	
Special Moment Frame (SMF)
Special braced/moment frames defined in (i)(b,c and (ii)b above, are detailed to exhibit 
higher ductility and can be used in any seismic zone. Ordinary concentrically braced frames 
and Ordinary Moment Frame (OMF) shall not be used in seismic zones IV and V and for 
bridges with importance factor greater than unity (1> 1.0) in seismic zone III. Provisions 
for eccentrically Braced Frame (EBF) are not covered in these guidelines and specialist 
literature may be referred to for detailing of such frames.
9.2.3	
Load and Load Combinations
	
1.	
Earthquake loads and response reduction factor shall be as per these 
guideline.

IRC : SP:114-2018
IRC:6, the following load combination shall also be considered as required in 
9.2.5.1, 9.2.6.2 and 9.2.7.3:
	
a)	
1.2 Dead Load (DL) + 0.5 Live Load (LL) ±2.5 Earthquake Load (EL); 
and
	
b)	
0.9 Dead Load (DL) & 2.5 Earthquake Load(EL).

All welds used in structures designed to resist earthquake loads shall be 
complete penetration butt welds, except in splices in compression members, 
which shall conform to 9.2.6.2.
	
iii.	
Bolted joints shall be designed not to share load in combination with welds 
on the same faying surface.
9.2.5	
Compression Members
9.2.5.1	
Member Strength in Compression

strength (without elastic buckling) Pd (i.e., Pr / Pd) is greater than 0.4, the required axial 
compressive strength of member in the absence of applied moment shall also be determined 
from the load combination given in 9.2.3. The required strength so determined need not 
exceed the maximum load transferred to the member considering 1.25 times over strength of 
the connecting beam or bracing element.
9.2.5.2	
Splice
	
1.	
A partial penetration weld may be provided in splice of compression members, 
such that the design strength of the joints shall be at least equal to 200 
percent of the required strength.

where Af is the area of each flange in the smaller connected column.
9.2.6	
Braced Frames:
9.2.6.1	
General Provisions
Depending on the geometry, a braced frame can be classified as either a Concentrically 
Braced Frame (CBF) or an Eccentrically Braced Frame (EBF). CBFs are usually provided in 
the crossframes and lateral-bracing systems of plate girder/ open web girders and piers. In a 
CBF system, the working lines of members essentially meet at a common point. A CBF can 
be designed as either a special CBF (SCBF) or an ordinary CBF (OCBF). A higher value of 
R is assigned to the SCBF system, but more stringent ductility detailing requirements need 
to be satisfied.

IRC : SP:114-2018
In braced frames, it is to be ensured that plastic deformation only occur in the braces, 
allowing the main members (axial and bending members) to remain essentially elastic, thus 
maintaining the gravity load-carrying capacity during a major earthquake.
Different types of braced frame systems are given in Fig. 9.3 to Fig. 9.5. Common provisions 
for all braced systems are given below. In additions to theses, system specific provisions 
given in respective subsection shall also be complied.
	
l 
The provisions in this section apply for diagonal, X-bracing, V and inverted 
V-type bracing in concentrically braced frames.
	
l 
For Eccentrically Braced Frames (EBF), specialist literature may be referred.
	
l 
K-bracing shall not be permitted in systems to resist earthquake. In K-bracing 
system, bracings are connected in the middle of an axial force carrying 
member and any unbalance in lateral force at joint due to failure of one brace 
may result in bending of the member leading to failure of member.
	
l 
Along any line of bracing, braces shall be provided such that for lateral 
loading in either direction, the tension braces will have to resist between 
30 to 70 per cent of the total lateral load.
	
l 
The concentrically braced frames should be designed to resist all gravity 
loads without considering the additional strength provided by bracings/ 
diagonals of bracing system.
	
l 
Concentrically braced frames shall be so designed that yielding of the 
diagonals in tension takes place before yielding failure of connections and 
buckling of main bending (beam) and compression (column) members.
	
l 
The bracing members shall be so designed that gross area yielding and not 
the net area rupture would govern the design tensile strength.
	
l 
For all built-up braces, the spacing of tack fasteners shall be such that 
the unfavourable slenderness ratio of individual element, between such 
fasteners, shall not exceed 0.4 times the governing slenderness ratio of the 
brace itself. Bolted connections shall be avoided within the middle one-fourth 
of the clear brace length (0.25 times the length in the middle).
	
l 
The connection should be checked for tension rupture and block shear for 
the load determined in respective clause.
	
l 
The connection shall be designed to withstand a moment of 1.2 times the full 
plastic moment of the braced section about the buckling axis.
	
l 
Gusset plates shall be checked for buckling out of their plane.

CHAPTER 10
SEISMIC ISOLATION DEVICES
10.1	
General
Seismic waves propagate from ground to superstructure through the substructure. Larger 
inertial mass of superstructure causes larger seismic force in the entire structure. Quantity 
of seismic motions actually experienced by a structure largely depends upon the seismic 
response (force and/ or displacement) of the structure. This response can be reduced by 
providing Isolation Devices between substructure and superstructure in the case of bearing 
supported bridges.
This chapter deals with the design of bridges incorporating Seismic Insolation Devices. Some 
of the currently known seismic isolation devices are:
	
i)	
Hydraulic Viscous Damper
	
ii)	
Elastomeric Bearing Damper (Low Damping Elastomer)
	
iii)	
High Damping Elastomeric Bearing Damper
	
iv)	
Lead-Rubber Bearing Damper
	
v)	
Friction Damper
Provision of isolation devices is optional and it may be decided by the designer on a case 
to case basis. Various types of isolation devices have different mechanism of seismic force 
reduction. Seismic Isolation devices covered in this chapter are permitted to be used for 
comparatively rigid structures where fundamental time period ‘T’ of the structure without 
incorporation of seismic isolation devices is less or equal to 1.0 sec. In the case of Type III 
soft soil, seismic isolation devices shall be avoided.
Reduction of response is achieved through either of the following phenomena:
	
i)	
By lengthening of the fundamental period of the structure (effect of period 
shift in the response spectrum), which reduces forces but increases 
displacements;
	
ii)	
By increasing the damping, which reduces displacements and may reduce 
forces;
	
iii)	
By a combination of the two effects (preferred).
Isolation Devices provide single or combination of the following functions:
	
iv)	
Vertical-load carrying capability, combined with high lateral flexibility and 
high vertical rigidity;
	
v)	
Energy dissipation (hysteretic, viscous, frictional);
	
vi)	
Lateral restoring capability;
	
vii)	
Horizontal restraint (sufficient elastic stiffness) under non-seismic service 
horizontal loads

Strength and integrity of the Isolation Device used is of utmost importance, due to the critical 
role of its displacement capability for the safety of the bridge. For all types of Isolation Devices 
excepting simple elastomeric low damping bearings and flat sliding bearings, the design 
properties shall be verified through established test methods.

Seismic Analysis of Structure Incorporating Isolation Devices

Response Reduction factor ‘R’ used for analysis shall be the one corresponding to non-
ductile structure, i.e. R=1.0.

In this case Rigid Deck Model shall be used for analysis. Transfer of earthquake shear through 
the Isolation Devices shall be determined considering single degree of freedom system;

For the determination of the seismic action effects on the isolating system and the substructure

Relevant clauses of Chapter 4 of these guidelines shall be applied for the combination of 
components of the seismic action.
10.4	
Elastic Response Spectrum Analysis
Simultaneous occurrence of seismic actions only two perpendicular horizontal directions 
(vertical direction not considered) shall be considered for combination rule. Accidental mass 
eccentricity need not be considered.
The effective damping given by expression (10.1) may be applied only to modes having 
periods higher than 0.8Teff. For all other modes, unless a more accurate estimation of the 
relevant damping ratio is made, the damping ratio corresponding to the structure without 
seismic isolation should be used.
The resulting displacement of the stiffness centre of the isolating system (dcd) and the resulting 
total shear force transferred through the isolation interface (Vd) in each of the two-horizontal 
directions, are subject to lower bounds as follows:
	
ρd
cd

Eq. 10.12
Where,
dcf ,Vf are respectively the design displacement and the shear force transferred through the 
isolation interface, calculated in accordance with Fundamental mode spectrum analysis of 
10.3.
In case the conditions of equations 10.11 & 10.12 are not met, the relevant effects on the 
isolation system, the deck and the substructures should be multiplied by:
	
0 80

ρd

Time History Analysis
Provisions of clause 10.4 apply, using expressions 10.11 and 10.12. The method of analysis 
as covered in Chapter 5 of these guidelines may be used.

Vertical Component of Seismic Action
The effect of the vertical component of the seismic action may be determined by elastic 
response spectrum analysis, regardless of the method used for the determination of the

response to the horizontal seismic action. The combination of the actions shall be as explained 
in Chapter 4.
10.7	
Properties of Isolation Devices
Design properties of the Seismic Isolation Devices shall be obtained from the supplier. There 
are different sets of proprieties for different types of Seismic Isolation Devices. Some of them 
are as follows:
In case of low-damping elastomeric bearing (viscous damping ratio ξ≤ 0.06), high-damping 
elastomeric bearing (viscous damping ratio ξ equal to 0.10 to 0.20) and lead-rubber bearing, 
damping ratio of the composite material and other related parameters are needed for analysis 
and design of the structure incorporating such Seismic Isolation Devices.
In case of Fluid Viscous Dampers, viscous force displacement parameters, viscous resistance, 
maximum displacement after incorporating the device into the structure, velocity of movement 
etc are needed for analysis and design of the structure incorporating such devices.
In case of Friction Sliding Dampers with flat or curved (preferred) surface, parameters such 
as dynamic sliding friction, maximum displacement after incorporating the device into the 
structure etc are needed for the design of structure incorporating Friction Sliding Dampers.
10.8	
Verification of Bridge Sub-structure and Superstructure with Isolating System
	
dbi,a	
=	
yISdbi,d	
Eq. 10.15
Where y Is is an amplification factor (taken as 1.50) that is applied only on the design 
displacement dbi,d in each isolation device i resulting from one of the procedures specified in 
10.2.
The maximum total displacement of each isolation device in each direction shall be obtained 
by adding to the above increased design seismic displacement, the offset displacement 
potentially induced by:
	
a)	
the permanent actions
	
b)	
the long-term deformations (post-tensioning, shrinkage and creep for 
concrete decks) of the superstructure, and
	
c)	
50% of the thermal action
All component of the isolating system shall be capable of functioning without any unacceptable 
deformations at the total maximum displacements.
Note: The maximum reaction of hydraulic viscous dampers (see 10.11) corresponding to the 
increased displacement dbi,a may be estimated by multiplying the reaction resulting from the 
analysis times yis
ab/2 where ab is the exponent of velocity of viscous damper.
Isolation devices consisting of simple low-damping elastomeric bearings should be verified 
for the action effects in accordance with relevant clauses of the bearing design code, taking 



======================================================================
PAGE 103 of 146
======================================================================
96
IRC : SP:114-2018
partial factor for material ym= 1.15. For simple low damping elastomeric bearings, in addition 
to the above verification, the following condition should be verified:
	
εq,d ≤ 2.0	
Eq. 10.16
Where εq,d is the shear strain calculated in accordance with relevant clauses of the bearing 
design code. In this context the movements vx.d and vyd should be taken equal to the maximum 
total relative displacements in the horizontal directions x and y. 
No uplift of isolators carrying vertical force shall be permitted in the seismic design combination.
Sliding elements shall be designed as per relevant clauses of the bearing design code. 
The Seismic internal forces EEA, derived from analysis, in the substructures and superstructure 
due to the design seismic action alone, shall be derived from the results of an analysis in 
accordance with 10.2. The design seismic forces EE due to the design seismic action alone, 
may be derived from the forces EEA, after division by the Response Reduction Factor ‘R’ 
=1, i.e. FE = FE.A/q with R = 1.0. All members of the structure should be verified to have an 
essentially elastic behaviour as per the relevant clauses. The design horizontal forces of 
supporting members (piers or abutments) carrying sliding bearings shall be derived from the 
maximum friction values as per relevant clauses of the bearing design code.
In the case of sliding bearings as mentioned above and when the same supporting member 
also carries viscous fluid dampers, then the design horizontal seismic force of the supporting 
member in the direction of the action of the damper should be increased by the maximum 
seismic force of the damper, see eqn. 10.17.
When single or multiple mode spectral analysis is carried out for isolating systems consisting 
of combination of elastomeric bearings and fluid viscous dampers supported on the same 
supporting elements(s), the phase difference between the maxima of the elastic and the 
viscous elements may be taken into account, by the following approximation. The seismic 
force should be determined as the most adverse of those corresponding to the following 
characteristic states:
	
a.	
At the state of maximum displacement. The damper forces are then equal to 
zero.
	
b.	
At the state of maximum velocity and zero displacement, when the maximum 
damper forces should be determined by assuming the maximum velocity to 
be:
	
	
	
Vmax = 2πdbd / Teff	
Eq. 10.17
	
	
Where dbd is the maximum damper displacement corresponding to the design 
displacement dcd of the isolating system.
	
c.	
At the state of the maximum inertial force on the superstructure, that should 
be estimated as follows:
	
	
	
Fmax = (f1+2ξbf2)SeMd	
Eq. 10.18



======================================================================
PAGE 104 of 146
======================================================================
97
IRC : SP:114-2018
Where Se is determined from Table 10.1
	
	
	
f1 = cos[arctan(2ξb)]	
Eq. 10.19a
	
	
	
f2 = sin[arctan(2ξb)]	
Eq. 10.19b
Where ξb is the contribution of the dampers to the effective damping ξeff of expression 10.1.
At this state the displacement amounts to f1dcd and the velocity of the dampers to v = f2v max 
In isolating systems consisting of a combination of fluid viscous dampers and elastomeric 
bearings, without sliding elements, the design horizontal force acting on supporting element(s) 
that carry both bearings and dampers for non-seismic situations of imposed deformation 
actions (temperature variation, etc.) should be determined by assuming that the damper 
reactions are zero.

ILLUSTRATION OF ELASTIC SEISMIC ACCELERATION METHOD Preamble
The elastic seismic acceleration method presented here illustrates the computation of 
seismic forces in accordance with method specified in clause 5.2.1 of Chapter 5. Application 
of this method involves modelling of structure in a standard software. Simplified formulae 
also can be used to find out the time period for some cases. In a typical bridge, the modelling 
would include the elements of superstructure, substructure, bearings, foundation, founding 
strata etc. However, for the understanding of the elastic seismic acceleration method, typical 
calculations are presented for following cases for the illustration purpose.

Notes:
	
1.	
Lumped mass can be modelled in any authenticated commercial analysis 
tools to find the Time Period/ Frequency/ Base Shear. Appropriately mass 
should be halved taking into consideration of note 2a & 2b.
	
2.	
For calculation of Base Shear,
	
a.	
For portion of foundation between the scour level & up to 30 m depth, the 
portion of foundation mass may be computed using seismic coefficient 
obtained by linearly interpolating between Ah at scour level & 0.5Ah at a 
depth 30 m below scour level.
	
b.	
For embedded portion of foundation at depths exceeding 30 m below 
scour level, the seismic force due to foundation mass may be computed 
using design seismic coefficient equal to 0.5Ah.
	
3.	
Alternatively, lumped mass can be modelled in any authenticated commercial 
analysis tools to find the Time Period/ Frequency/ Base Shear. Appropriately 
mass should be halved taking into consideration of note 2a & 2b.
	
4.	
Actual configuration of well foundation shall be modeled as per user (project) 
or any equivalent member of combined stiffness in case of multiple wells.
	
5.	
The stiffness of soil springs is to be calculated in accordance with provisions 
of any specialist literature.

APPENDIX – A-2
ILLUSTRATION OF ELASTIC RESPONSE SPECTRUM METHOD
Design Example:
The elastic response spectrum method is for the consideration of seismic forces. Application 
of this method involves modelling of structure in a standard software. In a typical bridge the 
modelling would include the elements of superstructure, substructure, bearings, foundation, 
founding strata etc., however, for the understanding of the elastic response spectrum method, 
a manual calculation is presented for 3 modes only. In actual real life problem there will be a 
need to consider higher modes for which modelling using standard software is recommended.

For purpose of illustration of Elastic Response Spectrum Analysis, it is assumed that Self 
weight of Superstructure, superimposed dead load, self-weight of pier cap, half mass of 
L1 length of pier and 20% live load (transverse seismic) are lumped on pier top. Two more 
lumped masses representing the pier mass are considered at intermediate height of pier.

Above calculation is only for the understanding of response spectrum method. In actual 
bridge design there is need to consider more number of mode shapes, soil structure 
interaction, modeling of superstructure, substructure and foundation may also be required. 
Consideration of number mode shapes, soil structure interaction etc. involves the solution of 
more equations and larger matrix which is difficult to solve manually and in such cases use 
of standard software is recommended.

Curtailment of longitudinal bars, if any, should be done at such a level that the design flexural 
strength of the section at the curtailed level (MRd,curtailed) should be greater than the capacity 
moment (Mc) at the curtailed level (Fig. 3). For this example, the curtailment level is assumed 
to be 6m above the ground level. The reinforcement detailing of the Pier section at the base 
and at the curtailment level is shown in Fig. 4.

The procedure to calculate the capacity shear is applied separately for each of the two 
horizontal components of the design seismic action. As per clause 7.2.4.2 (a) the over-
strength moment of the sections due to plastic mechanism is obtained by multiplying the 
design flexural strength of the section with appropriate over-strength factors.  
Over-strength factor for concrete substructures = γo
=
1.35
As per clause 7.2.4.2 (b) of this guideline, the over strength factor has to be multiplied with a 
factor ‘K’ if the value of normalized axial force ‘ηk’ is greater than 0.1.
Where, ηk= NED/Acfck = (14682 x 1000) / (3570000 x 45)
=
0.091 < 0.1
Since the value of normalized axial force, ηk, is less than 0.1, the over-strength factor does 
not require any modification.

Capacity moment at curtailed section along Transverse Direction, 
Mc,T, curtailed = 39677 x (10.25-6)/10.25

Hence, the design flexural strength of the section at curtailed level is more than the capacity 
moment at the same level.

Capacity Design Shear in Pier
As per section 7.8 of this guideline, the increase of moments of plastic hinges, ΔM, is 
obtained by deducting the moment due to permanent actions, i.e. live load and braking force 
(considering appropriate load factors) from the over-strength moment of the section along 
both the directions. The increase in moment of plastic hinge is:-
Along Longitudinal Direction, ΔML = 37341 - 632
=
36709 kNm
Along Transverse Direction, ΔMT = 39677 - 634
=
39043 kNm
As per clause 7.2.4.2 (e), shear corresponding to this increase in moment is obtained as:-
ΔV = (ΣΔM) / h
Shear Along Longitudinal Direction = ΔML / h = 36709/10.25
=
3582 kN
(3)
Shear Along Transverse Direction = ΔMT / h =39043/10.25
=
3810 kN
(4)
Bearings and connections are to be designed for lesser of the following forces:-
	
(i)	
Seismic forces obtained using Response reduction factor as applicable for 
assessment of bearings.
	
(ii)	
Forces developed due to over strength moment when hinge is formed in the 
substructure
Hence the design seismic forces acting at base of Pier are:-
Along Longitudinal Direction, lesser of (1) and (3)	
=	 3582 kN
Along Transverse Direction, lesser of (2) and (4)	
= 	 3735 kN
The factored shear due to permanent actions (braking force for this example) is then added 
to the shear due to design seismic forces so as to obtain the Final Capacity design shear 
along both the directions.
Final Capacity Design Shear in Longitudinal Direction = 3541+ 57	
=	 3582 kN
Final Capacity Design Shear in Transverse Direction	
=	 3735 kN
Checks should be carried out to ensure that the regions of the pier beyond plastic hinge have 
shear strength greater than the Final Capacity Design shear of the section along both the 
directions. Also, these regions have to be checked for Capacity design moments developed 
due to ‘Final Capacity Design Shears’. Then the forces and moments acting at the base of the 
pile cap are calculated. The foundation is designed for the forces along both the directions 
separately.
2.2	
Capacity check for Pile
The summary of forces acting at the base of pile cap for the considered maximum vertical load 
case in Longitudinal and Transverse is given in Table 4. The number of piles is considered 
as 4.

The depth of fixity is assumed to be 9m from the pile cap bottom. The reduction factor for 
fixed head pile is assumed to be 0.8 as per Fig. 5 of IS 2911(Part 1/Sec 2).
Maximum moment on a pile is observed to be
Along Longitudinal Direction

896 x 9/2x 0.81 = 3266 kNm
Along Transverse Direction	
=	
934 x 9/2x 0.81 = 3405 kNm
The pile diameter is assumed to be 1.2 m and the corresponding reinforcement assumed 
is 19 numbers of (32+20 mm) bundled bars. For the above said pile, the capacity at the 
minimum axial load i.e. -1023 kN and -1337 kN along longitudinal and transverse direction 
respectively is found out to be 3575 kN and 3484 kN respectively. The capacity of the Pile for 
longitudinal and transverse seismic case is more than the maximum moment on the pile. The 
Myy-Mzz interaction chart for the above sections is shown in Fig. 6.

APPENDIX – A5
ILLUSTRATION OF LIQUEFACTION OF SOIL
A-5.1	
General
A condition of decrease in the shear strength and/or stiffness caused by the increase in pore 
water pressures in saturated cohesion less materials during earthquake ground motion is 
referred to as liquefaction. It gives rise to significant permanent deformations or even to a 
condition of near-zero effective stress in the soil.
A-5.1.1	
Evaluation of Liquefaction Potential
An evaluation of the liquefaction susceptibility should be made when the foundation soils 
include extended layers or thick loose sand, with or without silt/clay fines, beneath the water 
table level, and when the water table level is close to the ground surface. To evaluate the 
liquefaction potential, investigations have to be conducted which include the in- situ Standard 
Penetration Tests (SPT) [IS 2131-1981] or Cone Penetration Tests (CPT) [IS 4968 (Part 3)- 
1976], as well as the determination of grain size distribution curves in the laboratory.
Liquefaction potential shall be evaluated by well-established methods of geotechnical 
engineering, based on field correlations between in situ measurements and the critical cyclic 
shear stresses known to have caused liquefaction during past earthquakes. Liquefaction 
potential may be estimated by calculating the factor of safety FOSL , which is given as-
	
	
	
	
	
FOS
CRR
CSR
L =
	
(1)
Where,
	
CRR – Cyclic resistance Ratio
	
CSR – Cyclic Stress Ratio
The soil shall be considered as liquefiable if, FOSL < 1
A.5.1.2	
Cyclic Resistance Ratio (CRR)
The cyclic resistance is to be calculated from measured blow count values of Standard 
Penetration Testing (NSPT), suitably modified with different correction factors. The corrected 
SPT blow count is represented by N1 (60) for hammer efficiency of 60 percent and is evaluated 
from expression below-
                                                          N1 (60) = NC60CN	
(2)
Where,
N=Uncorrected SPT blow count
C60=CHTCHWCSSCRLCBD= correction factor for non-standard SPT configurations
CN= Overburden Correction Factor

IRC : SP:114-2018
Normalisation with respect to overburden effects may be performed by multiplying the 
measured NSPT value by the factor CN given as in Equation (3).
	
	
	
	
CN= (100/σ′ vο )0.5 ≤ 1.7	
(3)
σ’vo - the effective overburden pressure acting at the depth where the SPT measurement has 
been made, and at the time of its execution (in kPa).
For SPT conducted as per IS 2131-1981, the energy delivered to the drill rod is about 60 
percent and factors C60 may be assumed as 1.
For non-standard SPT configuration factors CHT, CHW, CBD, CRL and CSS are given below-
	
l 
CHT and CHW are correction factors for non-standard weight or height of fall. 
Values of CHT for energy ratio 80 percent are-
	
	
CHT = 0.75 (for Donut hammer with rope and pulley)
	
	
      = 1.33 (for Donut hammer with trip/auto)
	
	
CHW shall be evaluated by following relation-
	
	
CHW=HW/48387 	
(4)
	
	
Where H = height of fall (mm)
	
	
           W = hammer weight (kg)
	
l 
The effect of borehole diameter is taken into account using factor CBD, the 
values of which are provided in Table 1. For different rod lengths, the rod 
length correction factor CRL is provided in Table 2.

The correction factor CSS for different sampling method is taken as 1.0 for 
standard sampler and for non-standard sampler following value should be 
considered-

FC= Fine contents in percentage
CRR, for 7.5 magnitude earthquake, is to be evaluated from N1(60)cs using the following 
expression:
The above expression is valid only for earthquakes with magnitude of 7.5. For earthquakes 
with different magnitudes, the calculated CRR7.5 is to be corrected by –
	
	
	
	
	
CRR = (CRR7.5).(MSF)Kσ Kα

CRR – corrected cyclic resistance ratio,
MSF – magnitude scaling factor given by following equation:
This factor is required when the magnitude is different than 7.5. The correction for high 
overburden stresses Kσ is required when overburden pressure is high (depth>15m) and 
using following equation:
Where σ′vo  effective overburden pressure and Pa atmospheric pressure are measured in the 
same units and f is an exponent and its value depends on the relative density Dr. for Dr=40%- 
60%, f=0.8-0.7 and for Dr=60%-80%, f=0.7-0.6. The correction for static shear stresses Ka is 
required only for sloping ground and shall be assumed unity otherwise.
