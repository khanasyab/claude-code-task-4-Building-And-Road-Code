GUIDELINES FOR CONVENTIONAL AND  
THIN WHITETOPPING
1.  INTRODUCTION 
1.1	
IRC:SP:76 “Tentative Guidelines for Conventional, Thin and Ultra-Thin 
Whitetopping” was first published in 2008. The Composite Pavement Committee (H-9) 
of IRC felt the necessity to revise this document. The revised draft document prepared 
by the H-9 committee was discussed in series of meetings. The H-9 Committee finalized 
the draft document in its meeting held on 19th December, 2015 for placing it before the 
Highways Specifications & Standards Committee. The HSS Committee in its meeting held on 
12th January, 2015 approved this document. The Council in its 204th meeting held at 
Bhubaneshwar (Odisha) on 19th January, 2015 approved the draft revision of IRC:SP:76 
“Guidelines for Conventional and Thin Whitetopping” after taking on board the comments 
offered by the members.

1.2	
Background
1.2.1 
Whitetopping is defined as a Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) overlay constructed 
on the top of an existing bituminous pavement. Whitetopping is thus PCC resurfacing (overlay) 
as a rehabilitation or structural strengthening alternative on bituminous pavement. The PCC 
overlay may or may not be bonded to the layer below. 
1.2.2	
Rutting of bituminous pavement is a real problem in hot climate like India, with 
heavy truck loads, operating under frequent start/stop conditions. A PCC overlay is commonly 
applied where rutting of bituminous pavements is a recurring problem. Concrete overlays offer 
the potential for extended service life, increased structural and functional capacity, reduced 
maintenance requirements, and lower life-cycle costs when compared with bituminous 
overlay alternative. 
1.2.3	
Concrete overlays have been used to rehabilitate both the existing bituminous 
(flexible) pavement since 1918 and existing concrete pavement since 1913. Whitetopping 
in its various forms has been used in the USA and Europe on Airports, Inter-state roads, 
Primary & Secondary Highways, Local Roads, Streets and Parking lots to improve the 
performance, durability and riding quality of deteriorated bituminous pavement surfaces. 
There has been a renewed interest in whitetopping, particularly, in Thin Whitetopping during 
the last two decades. This has been possible due to several successful high profile projects 
executed in USA, Europe and India. Their effectiveness has further renewed interest in them 
because they satisfy the demand caused by rapidly deteriorating highways confronted with 
limited fund availability. Conventional Whitetopping, and Thin Whitetopping (TWT) with 15-
20 years of design life offer immense potential as a rehabilitation strategy for Indian roads. 
Several successful projects have been executed at Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Nagpur, Jaipur and 
Bangalore in the last few years. The performance of these sections has been found to be 
satisfactory. 
1.2.4	
PCC overlays are also placed on existing concrete surfaces, as rehabilitation/ 
strengthening measure. Such overlays, even though used on experimental basis for

IRC:SP:76-2015
3
rehabilitation of existing concrete roads are not called whitetopping (as the existing surface 
is not bituminous) and accordingly, do not fall under the scope of this guideline. 
1.3 
Benefits of Whitetopping 
Whitetopping on existing bituminous pavements provides many additional benefits as 
compared to conventional bituminous overlay alternative. Some of the benefits are: 
	
Long life, low maintenance, low life-cycle cost, improved safety and environmental 
benefits.
	
Bituminous overlays exhibit a more rapid loss of serviceability as compared to 
concrete whitetopping at some critical locations. The lives of successive bituminous 
overlays become progressively shorter after the first overlay. 
	
Deformation like rutting and cracking predominant in case of bituminous pavements 
is normally absent with concrete surfaces of whitetopping. This is particularly true 
in a hot climate like India. 
	
Conventional Whitetopping improves structural capacity of existing bituminous 
pavement, if built on a strong base course, and it impedes structural distresses. 
	
Whitetopping requires much less maintenance and as such involves much less 
frequent lane closures of road, as compared to bituminous surfaces. 
	
Whitetopping is quite cost-effective to tackle annual budget constraints and high 
traffic levels. It is, therefore, quite relevant to Indian conditions.
 
Whitetopping can uniformly fill ruts in the wheel path of bituminous pavements more 
effectively because concrete is far more stiff and consistent at high temperature 
than bituminous mixes. Broadly, for similar reasons, the occurrence of cracks is 
also relatively much less in case of whitetopping.
 
Concrete is relatively light in colour and hence concrete surface is more reflective to 
light, absorb less heat and reduce the urban heat island effect. Improved reflection 
of lights from vehicles enhances safety, lowers energy requirement of external 
lighting, lower contribution to heat in environment. 
 	
Fuel consumption on concrete roads has been found to be less than the bituminous 
roads. 
1.4 
Types of Whitetopping
Whitetopping is classified into three types. This is based on the types of interface provided 
i.e. degree of bonding between the underlying bituminous layer with PCC overlay and the 
thickness of the overlay; three types of interfaces are:
	
Bonded interface
	
Unbonded interface 
	
Partial bonded interface

IRC:SP:76-2015

i)	
Conventional Whitetopping 
It consists of a PCC overlay of thickness 200 mm or more (on the top of existing bituminous 
layer) which is designed and constructed without consideration of any bond between the 
concrete overlay and underlying bituminous layer. Conventional whitetopping is designed and 
constructed like a new rigid pavement without assuming any composite action.  Conventional 
whitetopping treats the existing bituminous surface as a sub-base like Dry Lean Concrete 
(DLC) and to this extent the condition of existing bituminous surface does not matter 
significantly, except that bituminous surface should not suffer from any isolated damages like 
subsidence or material related problems.
ii)	
Thin Whitetopping (TWT) 
PCC overlay of thickness greater than 100 mm and less than 200 mm is classified as Thin 
Whitetopping (TWT). The bond between the overlaid PCC and underlying bituminous layer 
is often a consideration but it is not mandatory. The bonding consideration may be ignored 
in the design. High strength concrete with fibres is commonly used. Joints are at shorter 
spacing of 0.6 to 1.25 m. 
iii)	
Ultra-Thin Whitetopping (UTWT) 
PCC overlay of thickness equal to or less than 100 mm is classified as Ultra-Thin Whitetopping 
(UTWT). Bonding between underlying bituminous layer and overlaid PCC layer is mandatory 
in case of Ultra Thin Whitetopping. Milling the existing bituminous surface to an average 
depth of 25 mm is normally used to provide the bonding at the interface between the existing 
bituminous surface and PCC overlay. Such bonding can be provided by some other methods 
also, but milling is considered desirable because effective bond between the existing and 
overlaid surface is absolutely essential for a better performance of UTWT. 
High strength concrete with fibres is normally provided with closely spaced joints (at interval 
of 0.6 to 1.25 m). Ultra thin whitetopping of 50 mm to 75 mm i.e. less than 100 mm is generally 
not recommended for Indian condition. Good construction technology in small urban towns to 
lay such thin high grade concrete may not be available. Besides the possibility of overloaded 
truck plying intermittently due to construction activities cannot be ruled out. However, for 
colony internal roads where traffic is restricted and controlled and good quality control is 
exercised during construction, the thin white topping can be considered.
1.5 	
When Whitetopping is not an Option
For all kinds of whitetopping, continuity of the subgrade/sub-base support is to be ensured 
and whitetopping should not be done at locations where availability of continuity of support 
is in doubt. The condition of the existing bituminous surface should be sound and free from 
wide cracks, material related distresses, isolated subgrade related problems.   
1.6 
Relevant Definitions
General terms used in the Guideline are defined under Appendix I.

2.  BEHAVIOUR  MECHANISM
TWT overlays are designed on the principle of a composite pavement structure which 
distributes traffic and environmental loading in a different manner than done in case of 
conventional PCC or flexible pavement. In case of such bonded system due to the composite 
action between concrete and flexible layer, the neutral axis shifts downward with the result 
that much of the area of PCC slab comes under compression and therefore a lesser thickness 
is required to carry the load than in the case with conventional PCC layer. 
 The other factor in case of TWT is that spacing of joints is considerably reduced due to which 
both curling and warping stresses are much less. 
Although a fully bonded system is ideal, the same, however, is very difficult to be realized 
and usually a partial bond is realized. As such, stresses lie somewhere in between the two 
extreme cases of unbonded and bonded. 
3.  MATERIALS
3.1	
Cement
Any of the following types of cement capable of achieving the design strength may be used 
with prior approval of the Engineer:
	
i)	
Ordinary portland Cement, 43 Grade, IS:8112
	
ii)	
Ordinary Portland Cement, 53 Grade,IS:12269
	
iii)	
Portland Pozzolana Cement, IS:1489
	
iv)	
Portland Slag Cement, IS:455
Preference should, however, be to use 43/53 Grade cement, as the grade of required concrete 
is M40 or more than M40. Lesser cement content means less water and, therefore, lesser 
chances of shrinkage cracks. 
While using 53 Grade Cement, fly ash upto 25% by weight of cementitious material may be 
added. 
3.2	
Admixtures
Admixtures conforming to IS:6925 and IS:9103 may (upto 2% by weight of cement as per 
IS: 456) be used to improve workability of the concrete or extension of setting time, on 
satisfactory evidence that they will not have any adverse effect on the properties of concrete 
with respect to strength, volume change and durability.
3.3	
Air Entraining Agents
The air entraining agents may be added upto 6.5% to increase the durability of the pavement 
in freezing and thawing regions. 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:76-2015
6
3.4	
Fibres
These shall be of steel/polypropylene/polyester/polyethylene/nylon fibres and shall be 
uniformly dispersed in the concrete mass. Use of fibres in concrete reduces its tendency 
to plastic shrinkage cracking and increases its ductility and abrasion resistance. Polymeric 
micro fibres with low elastic modulus are not expected to increase the load-resisting capacity 
of the concrete significantly, at low dosages (0.3% by volume of concrete). Structural fibre 
reinforced concrete prepared with macro polymeric fibre has enhanced strength, toughness 
and endurance without significantly changing the modulus of elasticity of concrete. Macro 
polymeric fibres, 30 mm to 60 mm length and more than 0.2 mm dia should be used with 
dosage of 0.5% to 1.5% by volume of concrete (4.5 to 14 kg/m3). These shall be added at 
the time of preparation of concrete. The synthetic fibres are slender and elongated filaments 
in the form of bundles, networks, strands of manufactured material that can be distributed 
thoroughly in the freshly mixed concrete. (ASTM C 1116)
The diameter of polymeric fibres normally varies from 10-70 micron and specific gravity is in 
the range of 0.91 - 1.34. The melting point of these fibres shall not be less than 160oC.  The 
aspect ratio generally varies from 200-2000. 
Fibre reinforced concrete shall be free from fibre balls when delivered. Tolerance in slump 
may be ± 15 mm for a slump of less than 50 mm and ± 25 mm for a slump greater than 
50 mm but less than 100 mm. The tolerance in mixing time shall be ± 3 Sec for time of mixing 
15 s, and ± 5 s for time of mixing of more than 15 s. For more details on specifications of 
fibres and their testing, ASTM C 1116 and ASTM 1399 may be referred.
IRC:SP:46-2013 should be referred for the use of fibres in concrete. 
3.5	
Aggregates
Aggregates for pavement concrete shall be natural material complying with IS:383 with a 
Los Angeles (LA) Abrasion/Aggregate Impact Value (AIV) not more than 35%. The limits of 
deleterious materials shall not exceed the requirements set out in IS:383. 
The aggregates shall be free from chert, flint, chalcedony or silica in a form that can react 
with the alkalies in the cement. In addition, the total chlorides content expressed as chloride 
ion content shall not exceed 0.06% by weight and the total sulphate content expressed as 
sulphuric (SO3) shall not exceed 0.25% by weight of dry aggregates.
3.5.1	
Coarse Aggregates
Coarse aggregates shall consist of clean, hard, strong, dense, non-porous and durable pieces 
of crushed stone or crushed gravel and shall be devoid of pieces of disintegrated stone, 
soft, flaky, elongated, very angular or splintery pieces. Aggregates should normally be rough 
textured and cubical in shape. Use of modern crushing technology for producing aggregates 
is considered desirable. The maximum size of coarse aggregates shall not exceed 31.5 
mm. The combined flakiness and elongation index of aggregates shall not be more than 
35 percent. No aggregate which has water absorption more than 2% shall be used in the 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 52
======================================================================

IRC:SP:76-2015
7
concrete mix. The aggregates shall be tested for soundness in accordance with IS:2386(Part 
V). After 5 cycles of testing, the loss shall not be more than 12% if sodium sulphate solution 
is used or 18% if magnesium sulphate solution is used. If aggregates are doubtful for alkali 
aggregate reactivity, IS:456 may be referred.
If the aggregates are not free from dirt, the same may be washed and drained for at least 72 
hours before batching. In such a situation the absorbed moisture content shall be carefully 
taken into account while calculating free water content in the mix. 
3.5.2	
Fine Aggregate 
The fine aggregates shall consist of clean natural sand or crushed stone sand or a combination 
of the two and shall conform to IS:383. Fine aggregates shall be free from soft particles, 
clay, shale, loam, cemented particles, mica and organic and other foreign matter. The fine 
aggregates shall not contain substances more than the following:
 
Clay lumps 
 
 
 
 
1.0%
 
Coal and lignite  
 
 
 
1.0%
 
Material passing 75 micron sieve  
 
3.0%  
 
Although IS:383 permits the fines passing 75 microns upto 15% in case of crushed sand, this 
provision should be used with caution. 
3.6	
Water
Water used for mixing and curing of concrete shall be clean and free from injurious amount of 
oil, salt, acid, vegetable matter or other substances harmful to the finished concrete. It shall 
meet the requirements stipulated in IS:456. Potable water is generally considered satisfactory 
for mixing and curing. 
3.7	
Mineral Admixtures
In case of Conventional Whitetopping, and Thin Whitetopping following materials may be 
added as mineral admixtures as per their availability: 
	
i)	
Fly ash grade I (as per IS 3812-2003), 
	
ii)	
Granulated blast furnace slag (as per IS: 12089) 
	
iii)	
Silica fume (as per IS: 15388-2003 and IS:456-2000, IRC:114-2013)
The silica-fume as per design is used where high performance concrete is the requirement of 
the design. It shall be added in suitable dozes normally @ 3-10% by weight of cementitious 
material.
To improve the ductility and fatigue resistance of high performance/high strength concrete, 
polymeric fibres may be added in the concrete 0.2-0.4% by weight of cement and/or steel 
fibres as per IRC:SP:46-2013. 
Polymeric fibres shall have water absorption less than 0.3% and shall not affect the properties 
of concrete (i.e reduction in the strength not more than 5%). Entrapped air content in the

concrete shall not be more than 3%, except where freezing and thawing is taking place. At 
such locations, provision shall be regulated by Para 3.2. 
Use of above additional materials including admixtures and air entraining agents in the 
conventional concrete improves the following properties of concrete:
	
i)	
Improvement in toughness,
	
ii)	
Reduction in shrinkage cracks 
	
iii)	
Long term mechanical properties, 
	
iv)	
High early strength, 
	
v)	
Ease of placement, cohesiveness and consolidation, 
	
vi)	
Volume stability and longer life, 
	
vii)	
Less abrasion, and least permeability,
	
viii)	 Improvement in load transfer at the joints due to improved aggregate 	
interlocking 
	
ix)	
Improvement in bond between aggregate - cement mortar and existing 
bituminous layer with fresh concrete. 
4.  MIX PROPORTIONING AND STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
4.1 
Following designed concrete mixes may be used for construction of both 
conventional and thin whitetopping: 
	
i)	
Conventional cement concrete,
 
ii) 
Fibre Reinforced concrete using fibres viz. polypropylene, polyethylene, 
nylon, polyester, steel (IRC:SP:46) etc.
 
iii) 
High Performance concrete using silica fume upto 3-10% by weight of 
cementitious material with and without using fly ash (upto 20%) or slag up to 
70% by weight of cement, (IRC:SP:70)
 
iv) 
High performance fibre reinforced concrete using specified fibres and mineral 
admixtures as per IS: 456 using a dose of chemical admixture @ upto 2.0% 
by weight of cement.
4.1.1	
Concrete mixes used are so proportioned that the concrete mix generally produces 
concrete of minimum characteristic compressive strength M40 or more than M40 at 28 days. 
High performance concrete of compressive strength M50 is normally preferred. The high 
strength high performance concrete is essential for fast track construction which is achieved 
by using early setting cements with microsilica as an essential additive. The cardinal  principle 
is that two third of the concrete strength should be developed within a period of 48 hours. 
Such a pavement can be opened to traffic within 72 hours of its laying. 
4.1.2	
UTWT/TWT projects are generally constructed with concrete of mix, having lower 
water/cement ratio, less than 0.40. It is, however, preferable to have a water cement ratio

9
around 0.30 to 0.38. The workability/slump requirement (25-50 mm) may be conveniently 
achieved by the use of high range water reducers (super plasticizers). The mixes may have 
high cement content (but not greater than 450 kg/m3). Extra precautions are required while 
using very high cement content with regard to the heat of hydration. The higher strength is 
derived not by increasing the cement content but by reduced water content. 
When designing concrete pavements, the flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of concrete 
is used rather than its compressive strength, as concrete fails in flexure rather than in 
compression. The mixes shall be designed as per IRC:44 or IS:10262. The minimum flexural 
strength or modulus of rupture (Third point loading) of the concrete shall be 4.5 MPa which 
corresponds to the minimum grade of concrete i.e. M40 at 28 days. It is, however, preferred 
to have a flexural strength of 5.0-6.0 MPa (Third Point Loading). 
4.2 
Self Compacting Concrete
Use of high workability, high flow or free flow or self compacting concrete can be used for 
overlays. Free flow concrete can be with slump flow 350 to 450 mm. This type of concrete 
require high cohesiveness, hence more fines (below 75 µm i.e. cement, mineral admixtures 
and additives etc.) and more fine aggregate (well graded), but all particles shall be well 
graded and higher dosages of superplasticizers are required. Requirement of the degree of 
cohesiveness will increase with the distance of haulage of ready mixed concrete. If dosages 
of superplasticizers increase beyond 1.5%, it may be advisable to use poly-carboxylic-ether 
based superplasticizers. Mineral admixtures like flyash, silica fume, GGBS (ground granulated 
blast furnace slag), metakaoline, and additives like lime stone powder etc. are required. The 
total mineral admixtures and additives should be increased to 35% of cementitious matter, 
for optimum results; and up to 50% while GGBS is used. The common methods of concrete 
proportioning as applicable to normal concrete shall need modifications. Mix proportioning 
and production of such concrete is the specialized activity and should be done under the 
supervision of experienced expert in that field with good amount of tests and trials. Such 
concrete may have higher shrinkage, requiring higher dosages of fibers.
High flow concrete may have the nominal maximum size of aggregate lower than the normal 
concrete. High flow concrete may have higher shrinkage and hence it will require higher fiber 
content for controlling shrinkage cracks.
Such concrete may have advantage of reducing the equipment needed for laying, compaction 
and the related noise during construction. It could therefore be preferred option for urban 
area even at higher price.
4.3 	
High Strength Concrete
Early opening concrete overlays can be designed such that it can be opened to traffic at a 
predetermined age (say 12 hours, or one to 3 days), also termed as “fast-track” concrete 
paving. This system requires a concrete which can gain specified design strength at the time 
of opening to traffic. An option may be to permit initially only light traffic for few days to keep 
fatigue damage factor low.

IRC:SP:76-2015
10
For early age flexural strength of concrete, the mix proportioning is to be done for achieving a 
specific strength at a specified small age. High flexural strength needs a limitation on nominal 
maximum size of aggregate (say 20 or 16 mm), a tighter tolerance for flakiness of aggregate 
fraction below 10 mm, a good gradation of particles up to micron size, a tighter control over 
lower tolerance in particle gradation, use of enough supplementary cementitious materials 
(SCM) like silica fume, flyash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, metakaoline, additives 
like lime stone powder etc., and total free water ≤ 150 kg/m³ (including the aqueous solution 
of admixtures). SCM’s improve the particle grading below 10 micron (µm) size, improves 
the transition zone on the surface of aggregate and improves the strength contribution of 
binder. 
Further for monitoring, the concept of ‘maturity of concrete’ is to be practiced with little 
additional tests and regular temperature record. With early opening to traffic, methods of wet 
curing are to be practiced while traffic is on the pavement. Concrete with high early strength 
also has higher shrinkage, hence, specific effort is required to reduce and control shrinkage 
related cracks. 
Early Age Behaviour: The early-age period is up to 96 hours after construction. During this 
period, the PQC strength is relatively low, and the stresses in the slab can be significant 
due to the large volumetric changes that occur due to temperature and moisture conditions 
in the slab. This is especially true for thin overlays, due to the high surface area to volume 
ratio. Early steps for curing (within one hour of laying concrete) and sufficient fibre dosage to 
control plastic shrinkage are required. Few demonstration projects have been successfully 
implemented.
5.  CONVENTIONAL WHITETOPPING
5.1	
General Considerations 
Conventional whitetopping, including inlays (at specified locations of weak sub-grade) have 
been extensively used in USA and Europe during 1940’s to 1960’s for overlaying existing 
flexible pavements. Various concrete thicknesses have been used depending upon the 
expected traffic loads. 
Whitetopping overlays are most appropriate for asphalt pavements that are extensively 
deteriorated. Pavements with excessive rutting, shoving, or alligator cracking are considered 
good candidates for Conventional Whitetopping overlays because these problems are not 
easily corrected with a hot-mix asphalt overlay. The condition of the existing pavement, 
however, affects the thickness design of Whitetopping overlays.
Most of the conventional whitetoppings have been constructed as Jointed Plain Concrete 
Pavements (JPCP). The use of Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP) and 
Fibre Reinforced Concrete Pavements (FRCP) have been practiced in USA from 1970’s 
onwards. The thickness of both JPCP and CRCP resurfacings has ranged from 150 to 250 
mm. Longitudinal steel reinforcement in CRCP has ranged from 0.5 to 0.6%.

In Conventional Whitetopping, polythene sheet or de-bonding layer is not provided. The PCC 
overlay can be laid directly on the existing bituminous surface. A white wash/ white curing 
compound may be used to minimize the temperature of existing bituminous pavement. 
Whitewash prevents heat build-up in a black interlayer surface as it essentially provides 
a white surface, which will absorb minimum sunlight. Whitewash consists of either white-
pigmented curing compound or lime slurry. 
During summer months the temperatures are generally greater than 35°C. Paving becomes 
difficult on soft layers at temperatures above 35°C. Paving of concrete overlays at such high 
temperature (> 350C) should not be done. Salt addition to a lime slurry white washing shall 
be avoided as the use of salt in whitewashing could be damaging to the overlay concrete and 
steel. 
Curing compound, if used as a whitewash, should conform to AASHTO specification M148. 
(Apply the compound to the resurfacing area at a rate of 2-3 ml per 100 cm2). The whitewash 
mixture and the rate of application shall produce a uniform colour on the surface. After 
whitewashing, interlayer surface will be allowed to cool adequately before starting the paving 
operation.
Conditions on the job site may create the need for a second application of whitewash. Rain 
or construction traffic can fade or wear away the whitewash colour. If a majority of the surface 
area is no longer coated, apply a second coat to faded areas. Some tracking by construction 
traffic is not detrimental. A uniform colour and coverage is preferred.   
If deformed reinforcement is in place during application of a second coat, maintain caution to 
avoid significant contact of the whitewash with the deformed bars. The reinforcement should 
be cleaned if a significant amount of whitewash is inadvertently applied.
5.2	
Pre-overlay Repair 
Conventional Whitetopping overlays do not require extensive pre-overlay repairs, but 
the repair of certain types of distresses may be important to avoid localized failures. In 
general, the condition of the underlying pavement is more critical to the performance of 
CRCP whitetopping overlays as compared to JPCP. ACPA (American Concrete Pavement 
Association) has published guidelines for whitetopping pre-overlay repair (ACPA 1998). The 
same is reproduced in Table 1.

5.3	
Pavement Evaluation
The evaluation of the existing pavement is an essential part of any overlay design including 
conventional whitetopping. Field evaluation typically consists of a visual distress survey, 
deflection testing using Benkelman Beam or Falling weight deflectometer and coring. 
Foundation support value (k) is key information for thickness design. The sugrade support 
value (k) for the existing bituminous surface can be back calculated from the resilient modulus 
(MR). ‘k’ values to be used can be taken from deflection test on the existing bituminous 
surface or by determining ‘k’ value from load test on the subgrade and thereafter using 
Correlation Charts. Any other suitable method may also be adopted connecting ‘k’ value of 
the subgrade to the modified ‘k’ value of bituminous subbase. For assessing the condition of 
existing pavement following information should also be collected:
• 
Type and thickness of the existing layers by taking cores or trial pits and collection 
of soil samples
• 
Type and extent of distresses
• 
Restriction on Finished Road Level (FRL)
• 
Width of existing pavement and proposed concrete overlay
• 
Presence of treacherous soil like Black Cotton soil
• 
Drainage condition, drainage requirements and sub-surface drainage 
• 
Traffic survey data
5.4 
Surface Preparation 
For Conventional Whitetopping, no special efforts are made to encourage bonding between the 
overlay and the underlying bituminous surface; however, some steps for surface preparations 
may be required to address distresses in the existing surface of the bituminous pavements or 



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 52
======================================================================

IRC:SP:76-2015
13
to correct surface profile. Three methods of surface preparation and overlaying are normally 
used for whitetopping:
• 
Direct Placement – The concrete overlay is placed directly on the existing hot 
bituminous surface after sweeping. Any ruts in the existing pavement are filled 
with concrete, resulting in a thicker concrete pavement in the rutted areas.
• 
Milling – The existing bituminous surface is milled to obtain a uniform surface. 
Milling can be used to remove surface distortion like cracks in the top portion and 
adjust cross slopes. The removal of thickness should be between 25 to 50 mm. 
Milling can also be selectively used with direct placement to treat the isolated 
stretch suffering from distortion in the project road. Milling is not mandatory. 
• 
Placement of Levelling Course – Sometimes a levelling course of bituminous 
mix is used to produce a uniform surface for paving. A levelling course typically 
consists of minimum 50 mm of Bituminous Macadam (BM). Exact quantity will 
depend upon the undulations. When the distortion/rutting depth exceeds more 
than 50 mm, the option of milling as an economical alternative may be evaluated. 
It is also a practice of laying levelling course along with concrete overlay.
• 
DLC/ PCC Levelling Course – Levelling/ profile correction can be done by using 
PCC (say M10 grade) or DLC layer. The minimum thickness may be 75 mm, 
average 100 mm and maximum 125 mm. At portions requiring > 125 mm PCC, a 
leaner concrete (say M5 or CC 1:4:8 or leaner DLC) may provided in thickness such 
that over it PCC or DLC will be minimum 75 mm. While profile correction is done 
by lean concrete (or DLC), a combination of milling in some portion can be opted 
to reduce the finished road level (FRL). A separation layer is to be used between 
DLC/PCC and concrete overlay. For separation layer, impermeable membrane 
of virgin (without filler material) low density polyethylene (LDPE) can be used. 
Geo-textile (non woven polypropylene blanket typically 0.45 to 0.55 kg/m²) about 
3 to 4 mm thick may also be used as a separation membrane. Research and 
project experience has shown that nonwoven geotextiles provide uniform elastic 
support to the concrete overlay, reduce pumping processes and prevent reflective 
cracking. The separation layer (or sheet) may not be provided where joint spacing 
is ≤ 12 (18 for structural FRC) times the thickness of PQC even if the PQC layer 
is designed as un-bonded pavement. 
5.5	
Inlays 
Concrete pavements are sometimes placed in a trend milled out of a thick asphalt pavement, 
in the form of concrete inlays. This is used where it is desired to remove and replace only the 
deteriorated lane (s). It is also effectively used where minimum vertical clearance requirements 
of structures like road-over-bridges prelude raising of the existing level of the road. In such 
cases, sufficient depth of the old pavement is milled out so that the concrete is levelled with, 
or only slightly higher than the existing shoulder or adjacent asphalt lane. 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:76-2015
14
For whitetopping in the form of inlays, thickness design and jointing practices to be adopted 
are the same as followed in case of normal pavement design practices as per IRC:58 and 
IRC:15. Dowels or reinforced concrete pavements for such inlays may be used, particularly, 
where heavy traffic and wet climatic conditions exist.
5.6	
Thickness Design 
The design principle adopted for conventional whitetopping is similar to those of normal 
concrete pavements as provided in IRC:58 “Guidelines for the Design of Plain Jointed 
Rigid Pavements for Highways” and IRC:15 “Standard Specifications and Code of Practice 
for Construction of Concrete Roads”. These standards may be followed for design of 
Conventional Whitetopping, except determination of modified/effective/support modulus of 
subgrade reaction (“k” value). The correlation between CBR and ‘k’ value for the subgrade 
as given in IRC:58 can be used for the design. 
Rigid pavements in India, at present, are mostly constructed on a sub-base of Dry Lean 
Concrete (DLC). Table 3 and 4 of IRC: 58 accordingly have been provided for correlating “k” 
values of soaked subgrade to the effective “k” values over granular/cement treated sub-bases. 
IRC:58 does not furnish any correlating table for determining effective “k” values for bituminous 
sub-base which will be the actual sub-base for conventional whitetopping. 
American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) in its engineering bulletin (EB210.02P) 
has given two charts for the determination of modified ‘k’ value on the top of bituminous 
pavement. 
One chart is for the case when the existing bituminous pavement is atop a granular base and 
the other chart is when the existing bituminous pavement is atop cement treated base. These 
charts are reproduced to assist the designer of Conventional Whitetopping to choose the 
modified ‘k’ value for the existing bituminous top. For this purpose, two alternative methods 
to determine the modified value of ‘k’ are suggested in this guideline. One method is to 
determine the ‘k’ value of the existing subgrade by plate load test and then the modified ‘k’ 
value for the bituminous top can be found out from the Figs 1 and 2 depending upon whether 
asphalt surface is on the granular base or on cement treated base. The plate load test being 
cumbersome is normally avoided by the Field Engineers and more reliance is placed on the 
deflection on the top of bituminous surface by Benkelman Beam Deflection (BBD) test. The 
graphical method given in Appendix III can be used for determining ‘k’ value with respect to 
the characteristic deflection of BBD test as per IRC:81. The rest of the design can be done 
with the help of existing IRC:58 by using the “k” values determined from the Figs. 1 and 2 
or Appendix III. Conventional Whitetopping should have a joint spacing of 4 to 4.5 m as per 
the normal concrete pavement with dowels at junctions regularly. Construction shall be as 
per IRC:15. Conventional whitetopping is expected to provide an alternative solution to the 
problems of rehabilitations of many flexible pavements constructed on the medium to heavily 
trafficked arterial roads.

6.  THIN WHITETOPPING (TWT)
6.1	
Introduction 
Thin Whitetopping is an innovative design concept that has emerged in the 1990’s. The first 
overlay of 90 mm of concrete pavement was placed over existing asphalt on two projects in 
Kentucky (USA) in 1988. In 1990 in Colorado (USA) number of sections of thickness of 90 
mm and 125 mm were placed. Fiber reinforced concrete sections of 50 and 90 mm thickness 
with 0.6 to 1.8 m joint spacing were slip formed on top of a deteriorated asphalt pavement in 
USA. Many of these slabs were instrumented to measure strains and deflections under the 
loads of many heavy trucks.
The performance of these thin slabs was outstanding. These remarkable performances had 
subsequently generated a renewed interest in Thin Whitetopping across the developed world. 
The use of TWT has grown rapidly in last one and a half decades. From 1990 to 1996 more 
than 800 projects, representing about 1 million sq.m have been placed in North America 
alone. Majority of data available from several projects have indicated good performance of 
TWT. 
6.2  Salient Features Thin White Topping
The development of an effective bond between PCC overlay and the existing bituminous 
pavement is desirable for the better performance of TWT because the strength of the existing 
bituminous pavement is being relied upon to carry part of the traffic load. 
 
i) 
Extensive surface preparation to promote significant bonding between the 
concrete overlay and the bituminous pavement is required. Some times 
chiselling may also be tried gently at certain locations where milling is difficult 
to make the bituminous surface rough. (Excessive roughened surface, 
however, should be avoided as this could enhance the frictional forces) 
	
ii)	
Use of short joint spacing (generally between 1.0 and 1.5 m). Square spacing 
(e.g. about 1.0 m x 1.0 m) are preferred. Rectangular spacing wherever given 
should have a ratio not exceeding 1.2 between the long and the short arms. 
	
iii)	
The minimum thickness of hot mix bituminous pavement is 75 mm (net 
excluding the milled thickness) for TWT. However, it is preferable to have this 
minimum thickness of 100 mm or more to ensure a reliable strong bituminous 
base. 
6.3  
Suitable Sites for TWT
Some of the sites for TWT overlays are given as:
	
i)	
Rural Roads
 
ii) 
Medium to Moderately Heavy Volume Roads (e.g. MDR, SH, Low Traffic NH)
	
iii)	
Intersections

viii) New roads for heavy traffic as an alternate to flexible pavement/conventional 
rigid pavement
	
ix)	
Bus bay and truck lay-bye
TWT should be used only when the condition of the existing bituminous surface is fair 
without wide cracks and without material/sub-grade related problems. Isolated locations with 
distresses related to material/sub-grade failure or heavy rutting should be replaced by lean 
concrete (Grade M10) by full/partial depth repair before laying TWT.
7.  PRE-OVERLAY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 
7.1 
Evaluation of Existing Pavement
A thorough examination of deficiencies of the existing pavement including assessment of the 
causes of deterioration should be done before selecting TWT as an alternative treatment. 
TWT is generally intended to be placed on the existing bituminous pavement that is exhibiting 
rutting, shoving and other similar surface distresses, but do not have much wide cracks. 
7.2 
Surface Preparation
For TWT, top of sub base surface should be prepared by milling and thereafter thorough 
cleaning of the milled material to ensure effective bonding. TWT can also be laid on prepared 
bituminous layer by process of levelling if the thickness of bituminous layer is adequate and 
it is in sound condition. Milling the existing bituminous surface is, however, quite desirable to 
enhance the bond and also to remove any surface distress or distortions. 
7.3	
Lane Closure
At many intersections like urban location, underpasses lane closure times may be somewhat 
restricted and possibility of detouring the traffic may not be quite possible. In all such 
situations, the use of fast track paving may be considered to minimize lane closure time. 
Early opening to traffic concrete could be used wherever, feasible. The specialist literature 
may be consulted for this purpose.
7.4	
Overhead Clearance
Matching of adjacent shoulder and traffic lane elevation are often a problem with rehabilitation 
projects. These locational problems are effectively tackled by resorting to suitable milling in 
case of TWT projects.

8.  THICKNESS DESIGN OF TWT
8.1 
Composite Action
Structural behaviour of TWT is quite complex. Design is based on composite action of the 
bituminous layer and PCC overlay. Pavement should, therefore, be analysed as composite 
system in which the concrete and bituminous layers are characterised by their thickness and 
elastic properties, all on top of a ‘k’ value for the subgrade. The degree of composite action 
assumed in the analysis has significant influences on the stresses developed. The results of 
mechanistic analysis suggest that load stresses depend upon the slab size (joint spacing) 
and bonding of PCC layer with asphalt pavement. There is a substantial reduction in load 
stress as slab size decreases.  This is also true for curling and warping stresses which occur 
due to temperature and moisture gradient in the concrete slab. 
In case of very short slabs and without substantial thickness of bituminous layer and base 
course, both deflection and vertical strains are high. This could lead to excessive permanent 
deformation in the foundation with time due to load repetitions. There is, therefore, always 
an optimum joint spacing for which stresses are reduced but deflections are not excessive. 
Considering the above aspect, the joint spacing between 1.0 to 1.5 m for Indian condition is 
recommended. 
Due to composite action as shown in Fig. 3, load stresses are reduced due to shifting of 
neutral axes near the interface. 
Some attempts have been made to develop such design procedures to estimate the load 
carrying capacity and service life of projects based on instrumentation of slab, field performance 
results and three dimensional finite element model. In all these design procedures, developed 
so far, consider the critical stresses both at the corner and joint locations of a slab, besides 
incorporating the temperature effect. For further details, literature at Sr. No. 9 and 24 of 
references may be referred.

8.2 
Design Factors 
8.2.1 
Traffic
The volume and character of present and anticipated traffic generally determines the number 
and width of traffic lanes. The weight and frequency of the wheel loads of this traffic form 
the basis of the slab’s structural design. The procedure given in IRC:58 may be followed for 
calculating the traffic frequency of wheel loads.
8.2.2	
Subgrade and Sub-bases 
Subgrade strength may be evaluated, if required on the basis of either CBR or modulus of sub 
grade reaction (k) value (as per IS:9214-1974). For more details, para 5 may be referred. 
8.2.3	
Sub-Base Course
8.2.3.1	
Layer of sound bituminous pavement of minimum 75 mm thickness after milling,
8.2.3.2 
Layer of bituminous pavement of thickness less than 75 mm with profile correction 
course of bituminous macadam to have total minimum bituminous pavement thickness of 
75 mm can be considered an exception. 
8.2.3.3 
Before laying profile correction course, tack coat is required as per MORTH 
Specifications.
8.2.3.4	
Any distress in the sub base layer shall be repaired with suitable materials. 
Location/stresses having isolated damages shall be removed up to full depth and rectified 
as per the specifications/drawings to make up atleast 75 mm thickness of bituminous 
pavements. 
8.2.3.5 
Benkelman Beam as per IRC:81 in case of flexible pavement may be referred. 
Appendix V may be used to convert test result of Benkelman Beam deflection data into 
modified ‘k’ value. Figs. 1 and 2 may be adopted for determining ‘k’ value on the top of 
asphalt pavement, if Benkelman Beam Deflection tests are not carried. 
8.2.3.6	
The maximum ‘k’ value shall preferably be 15 kg/cm2/cm.
8.3 
Critical Stress Location
Primary distresses exhibited on TWT projects have been observed to be the corner breaks. 
These corner breaks are frequently but not always preceeded by debonding between concrete 
overlay and underlying bituminous layer. The debonding mainly occur due to upward curling 
at corners during night time. The corner breaking being the primary distress suggests that 
the critical stress location for design of TWT is the corner and corner stresses due to load 
as well as curling are the critical stresses. Edge load and temperature stresses which cause 
top-up transverse cracking in the middle of the slab in conventional rigid pavement slab are 
not critical in short TWT panels.

8.4 
Stresses Due to Temperature Curling 
8.4.1	
Negative temperature gradients (top cooler than the bottom) produces tensile 
curling stresses on top of the slab at the corner. The temperature curling stresses σT at the top 
of the slab corner can be computed by the equation 1 (Mack et al. 1997). The equation has 
been adopted by modified ACPA design procedure for whitetopping overlays (Riley, 2005). 
 
σT = 1.933-241000(α ΔT) + 1.267(L/le)......1
where,
 
σT = curling tensile stress at corner, kg/cm2
 
α = coefficient of thermal expansion, /oC
 
ΔT = negative temperature differential, oC
	
L = length of square slab, cm
	
le = radius of relative stiffness, cm
8.4.2	
Maximum negative temperature differential measured through 30 cm to 34 cm 
thick instrumented concrete slabs in India was observed to be 0.17oC/cm at Kota, 0.23oC/
cm at Siliguri, and 0.21oC/cm at Allahabad with an overall average of 0.20oC/cm. For thinner 
slabs of TWT, a lesser value of 0.15oC/cm can be adopted for calculating the tensile curling 
stresses at the corner of the slab. 
8.5 
Stresses due to Load and Temperature 
The primary distresses exhibited by the TWT projects have been corner cracks. The corner 
breaking being the primary distress suggests that the critical stress location for design of TWT 
overlays is the corner stress. The corner tensile bending stress in a slab for 8T single axle 
load and 16T tandem axle load can be computed by equation 2 and equation 3 respectively 
(Mack et al. 1997).
Log(σ8) = 3.6525 - 0.465log(k) + 0.686log(L/le) – 1.291log (le)
......2
Log(σ16) = 3.249 - 0.559log(k) + 1.395log(L/le) – 0.963log (le) – 0.088 (L/le)
........3
where,
  
σ8 = bending tensile stress at corner for 8T single axle load, kg/cm2
 
σ16 =   bending tensile stress at corner for 16T tandem axle load, kg/cm2
	
k = modulus of subgrade reaction, kg/cm3
	
L = length of square slab, cm
	
le = radius of relative stiffness, cm
The corner bending tensile stresses for other single and tandem axle loads can be computed 
proportionately by using σ8 and σ16 values respectively. If the panel size is less than 1.30 m, 
then two axles of a tandem axle vehicle will not fall on the same panel simultaneously, hence, 
stresses should only be considered for single axle. The possibility of wheels of two adjacent 
vehicles simultaneously placed on one panel is also excluded.

8.6 
Stress Ratio and Fatigue of Concrete Slab
Fatigue criteria based on Miner’s hypothesis and IRC:58 has been considered. The fatigue 
resistance not consumed by repetition of one load is available for repetitions of loads from 
other vehicles (other loads). In the design, total fatigue should not generally exceed 100 
percent. The concrete fatigue criterion based on stresses ratio and allowable repetitions are 
given in IRC:58. Stress ratio is computed as the load stresses divided by the flexural strength 
or Modulus of Rupture (MOR) of the concrete. If structural fibre reinforced concrete is used 
then stress ratio is given by the following equation.
SR = Flexural Stress/MOR(1 + R150)
Where, R150 is the residual strength ratio which characterizes the contribution of the structural 
fibre reinforcement. It is recommended that the residual strength ratio should be determined 
following ASTM C 1609 or IRC:SP:46-2013.
8.7 
Steps for Design Procedure 
 
i) 
Find traffic in terms of commercial vehicles per day (CVPD) and their 
percentages of the total traffic including single axle and tandem axles.
	
ii)	
Evaluate soaked CBR/k value of sub grade
 
iii) 
Find Modified ‘k’ value or support modulus (from Appendix III/Figs. 1 or 2 as 
for conventional whitetopping or) on sub base of asphalt pavement from the 
modulus of subgrade reaction of the subgrade. 
	
iv)	
Assume a trial thickness and joint spacing (say 1 m or 1.2 m)
	
v)	
Find Temperature Stresses
	
vi)	
Find corner load stresses and curling stresses using equations 1 to 3. 
Calculate stress ratio using corner load stresses and find out total fatigue life 
consumed which should be less than one. 
	
vii)	
Calculate total of maximum load and curling stresses at corner. It should be 
less than the flexural strength of concrete.
 
viii) Formula for determining flexural strength at third point loading as per 
IS 516-1959 is given below:
	
	
Flexural Strength at third point loading = [Pl/bd2]
where,
   	
l 	
is effective length of beam, or distance between two supports in cm
	
	
b&d are breadth and depth of beam in cm
	
P	
is the load at failure of the beam in kg
	
ix) 	 Determine fatigue consumed, which shall be less than one.
	
x)	
A typical, design example is given in Appendices II.

9.  STEPS OF CONSTRUCTION
9.1 
Milling
The milling of the existing asphalt pavement provides removal of rutting, a roughened 
surface to enhance the bonding between the new concrete overlay and the existing asphalt 
pavement. The depth of milling (25–50 mm) depends upon the types and severity of distress 
especially the depth of rutting or other surface distortions and the available thickness of 
asphalt pavement. Hand grinding/Light Chiselling may also be used gently for making the 
roughness in top surface of asphalt pavement at difficult locations. In case of non availability 
of the required machinery, a profile correction course of bituminous macadam (of minimum 
thickness 50 mm) may be laid over existing bituminous pavement after applying tack coat as 
per MORT&H Specifications so as to have a net bituminous thickness of 75 mm.
9.2 
Repair to Existing Pavement
The milled pavement shall be repaired in respect of cracks and wherever the cracks are too 
many indicating failure of subgrade, the pavement shall be replaced and simultaneously the 
subgrade will also be re-compacted.   
Existing bituminous layer after milling shall be in good condition to minimize reflection cracks 
or sympathetic cracks. If locally any distress/defects/cracks are observed, these shall be 
repaired/ sealed using properly designed dense bituminous mixes. The top of milled surface 
and repaired portion shall be in level with each other. The cracks shall be repaired first with 
hot bitumen of any suitable grade, before laying PCC and the surface is then broomed by 
compressed air/vacuum pump to remove debris prior to placing of concrete. The surface of 
the asphalt shall be flushed with water to aid in cleaning, before overlay is applied. 
9.3 
Cleaning
After milling or providing the profile correction course, atop the existing asphalt pavement, 
the top surface is cleaned to ensure bonding between the existing asphalt pavement and the 
new concrete overlay. Different methods of cleaning to remove foreign particles are given as:
 
• 
Air blasting/vacuum cleaner 
 
• 
Power brooming
 
• 
Water blasting
 
• 
Sand blasting
 
• 
Chiseling 
9.4 
Placing, Finish, Texturing and Curing using Conventional Paving 
Techniques and Materials
After the milling operation/laying profile correction course, form work using steel channels 
or girder are fixed and stability of these is ensured simultaneously. Cement slurry may be 
applied before placement of PCC. Concrete is placed, finished and cured using conventional 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 52
======================================================================

IRC:SP:76-2015
23
paving techniques and materials. After the laying of PCC, runner beam shall simultaneously 
be provided without causing vibration/disturbance to the newly laid TWT. Use of kerb stone 
as form work is not preferred. Use of semi mechanized method, slip form paver or fixed form 
paver may be adopted as per IRC:15 based on size of project and availability of the space 
and equipment. Curing compound/ water should be applied twice the normal rate, because 
TWT is thin concrete slab which has high surface area to volume ratio and can loose surface 
moisture rapidly due to evaporation.
The timing of the texturing operation is important. If done too early or too late, the desired 
skid resistance will not be obtained. The best time for texturing is just after the water sheen 
has disappeared and just before the concrete becomes non-plastic
For low speed, municipal or urban projects, a burlap drag, turf drag, or coarse broom texture 
is sufficient from lower side to upper side. For high-speed interstate and other primary routes, 
tining provides excellent long-term skid resistance. 
9.5 
Drainage
Drains, inlets and manholes must be raised to match the elevation of the new pavement. 
Drainage pipe shall be below the drainage layer, if provided. The slabs around the manhole 
shall preferably be with Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) using nominal reinforcement of 
10 mm dia plain bars at 150 mm c/c at neutral axis.
9.6	
Due to special problems of urban areas, construction practices and detailing need 
to be evolved. Additional corner steel at man hole, paver block surface along edges for future 
services, cross pipes at regular interval for future services etc. have to be properly planned. 
Overlay invariably raises the road level and hence slight re-planning of storm water system 
or reverse camber at the entry to houses etc. will have to be planned. Typical photographs 
are given in Appendix IV and V.
10. JOINTS
The ratio of the length (longest dimension) to width (shortest dimension) of any given panel 
is recommended to be not more than 1.20.  Following types of joints are being adopted in the 
construction of conventional rigid pavement.
	
i)	
Contraction Joints
	
ii)	
Expansion Joint
	
iii)	
Construction Joint
	
iv)	
Longitudinal Joints 
In the case of TWT, construction of these joints is slightly modified because of small size 
panel and bonding or partial bonding of TWT layer with the sub base layer:
10.1	
Initially, 3-5 mm wide joint may be cut within 6-18 hours (depending upon the 
grade of concrete being used and admixtures added) to a depth of 1/3 of the slab’s depth. 



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:76-2015
24
10.2	
Tie bars are designed to withstand tensile stresses only. The maximum tension 
in the tie bars across any joint is equal to the force required to overcome friction between 
pavement and subgrade, from the joint in question to the nearest free joint. The term free 
joint is applied to any type of pavement joint that has no tie bars or bonded reinforcement 
across in it. Deformed steel tie bars of length 500 mm, 10 mm diameter and spacing of 
750 mm shall be provided at longitudinal construction butt joint.
10.3	
Dowel bars are mechanical load transfer devices built as an integral part of certain 
transverse joints to permit the joint to open and close but to hold the slab ends on each side 
of the joints, as nearly as possible, at same elevation. The deflection of one slab under the 
load is resisted (through the dowel) by the other slab which, in turn, is caused to deflect and 
thus to carry a portion of the load imposed upon the first slab. 
10.4	
In case of TWT, the pavement is divided into relatively short panels by contraction 
joints which are so spaced to prevent formation of intermediate cracks. In case of TWT when 
thickness is less than 150 mm, provision of the use of dowel bars may be omitted. When 
TWT thickness is 150 mm to 200 mm and where pavement joins a structure such as a bridge, 
at the intersection with other pavement or for any transverse butt type joints viz. construction 
joints, plain mild steel dowels with plastic sheathing of 25 mm dia and of length 500 mm at 
spacing of 300 mm c/c. may be provided. 
10.5	
Short joint spacing is critical for the good performance of TWT projects. Acting like 
a paver block system, it reduces curling stresses and bending stresses in concrete slab due 
to loads. 
Load transfer is provided by aggregate interlock, which is further enhanced by short joint 
spacing and by the support of the underlying pavement. Compared to conventional pavements, 
load transfer is not as critical for concrete overlays because the underlying pavement provides 
considerable support to the joints. 
For TWT, extra concrete thickness is needed near the joint at the transition to the asphalt 
roadway. Similar practice is continued near the taper joint (Figs 4 & 5).

25
Fig. 5: Cross Section of TWT at Taper
Timely joint cutting (with in 6-18 hours of laying of TWT) prevents cracking, minimizes curling 
and warping stresses. Early cutting of joint is desirable. Since more number of joints are 
required to be cut because of close spacing, it is preferable to resort to skip-sign to avoid 
cracking. The intermediate joints shall be cut after the skip sawing is completed. The sawing 
should be started when the pavement is able to bear the weight of the saw cutting machine 
and the crew. Higher rate of strength development may need Joint cutting after 5 hours or 
so. Each properly aligned tie bar shall be at least 50 mm away from the joint/free edge. The 
minimum concrete cover around steel bars shall be about 50 mm
It is preferred to first dip the tie bars in the cement slurry before using in the TWT to minimize 
corrosion and have adequate bond with concrete.
An approved high-quality sealant shall be used to seal joint reservoirs and prevent moisture 
and incompressible infiltration into the overlay system. Sealants should be installed following 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Details of the joints and their sealing with sealant or preformed seals as shown in Fig. 6 are 
given in IRC:15 and IRC:57.

The photographs of construction practice adopted for dowel bars and tie bars are attached. 
Dowel bars are normally provided at the construction joint in white topping technology as 
panel size are small. Similarly if roads are executed in half width then for central joint tie bars 
are provided
10.6	
Drainage is an important consideration for the efficient functioning of Whtietopping 
like any rigid pavement.  The field engineers should make suitable drainage provision.  It 
should be ensured that drainage along the carriageway is efficiently handled, so that no 
water is intercepted underneath the slab. For this purpose, any arrangement being followed 
in normal road projects can be adopted.
11.  OPENING TO TRAFFIC
The traffic can be opened when the TWT has attained the desired strength depending on the 
traffic loading condition. Usually, traffic may be opened after 28 days (or at the age at which 
minimum compressive strength of 28.0 MPa is achieved) of casting Paving Quality Concrete 
(PQC)/PCC slabs.

12.  DISTRESSES IN WHITETOPPING
Due to reduced maintenance cost the white topping is now accepted by public as well as 
authorities. There are typical distress conditions in this technology but as most of them are 
localised and may not affect the riding quality the same is generally tolerated by public. 
Photographs showing these distresses, causes and remedial measures are attached in 
Appendix VI.
13.  SPECIAL CASES OF WHITETOPPING
13.1	
Presently the technology is used for existing roads in urban area carrying low 
volume traffic. However by properly designing the overlay thickness the technology can also 
be adopted for heavy density corridors. In the white topping technology curling/temperature 
stresses are minimum and panels are designed for corner stresses. The panel size is kept 
less than 1.5 m x 1.5 m and preferably 1.25 m x 1.25 m. The dowels can be omitted. 
13.2 
The exiting metalled or damaged village roads are commonly revived by first 
putting a WBM/WMM overlay followed by carpet and seal coat. As an alternate a concrete 
overlay of 75 mm to 100 mm with panel size of 1 m x 1 m would meet the need and prove an 
economical alternative.
13.3 
New roads carrying heavy traffic can also be designed as thin concrete pavements 
with thicknesses in the range of 180 to 200 mm and maximum panel size of 1.5 m x 1.5 m. 
Drainage cum granular sub-base and dry lean concrete base of adequate thicknesses should 
be provided for such pavements. 
FUTURE RESEARCH
Following activities may be considered in future R&D Projects:
• 
Development and adoption of a mechanistic method for the design of concrete 
overlay is needed.  The method should consider the capability of each layer in the 
pavement system as well as the foundation itself.
• 
Additional data are needed regarding the performance of fibrous, pozzolona 
admixed and prestressed concrete overlay under repeated loading applications 
and environmental effects.  In addition, studies leading to improved handling and 
construction methods for these materials are needed to improve their economic 
competitiveness with other types of concrete overlays.  These materials have 
many of the properties ideally suited for resurfacings, especially the resurfacing of 
existing pavements that are structurally distressed.
• 
Although many unbonded concrete resurfacings have been constructed, there 
have been few studies to define the desirable properties of the unbonding medium. 
Studies to define the minimum and maximum thicknesses, stiffness requirements, 
types of materials, frictional characteristics, etc., are needed.
• 
The collection and rigorous analysis of performance data from the large number 
of concrete overlays that have been constructed are needed to provide guidance 
and confidence in the selection, design and construction of the various concrete 
overlay alternatives.

Temperature Curling Stresses:
 
σT = 1.933-241000(α ΔT) + 1.267(L/le) 
 
ΔT = - 0.15oC/cm x Thickness of white topping overlay
    	
	
= - 0.15 x 18
    	
	
= - 2.7oC
 
α = 10 x 10-6
	
L = Length of square slab = 150 cm
	
le = Radius of relative stiffness = [Eh3/12(1-µ2)k]0.25 = 62.15 cm
 
Thus, σT = 1.933 - 241000[10x10-6 (-2.7)] + 1.267 (150/62.15)
	
 	 = 11.49 kg/cm2
 
Total flexural stresses due to load and curling = Maximum load stresses + curling 
stresses
	
	
= 27.23 + 11.49
	
	
= 38.72 kg/cm2
 
This is less than the minimum flexural strength of 45 kg/cm2.
	
Hence, design is safe. White topping thickness of 18 cm can be adopted.

Appendix IV
Demonstration Project of TWT
Whitetopping in Pune City
Pune city has adopted the Thin White Topping (TWT) treatment for internal roads as well as 
wider roads with higher traffic volume. Started in 2008, Pune city has constructed above 75 to 
80 km of roads (approx. 9 lakh sq m) with TWT technology. The TWT overlay, 125 mm thick, 
constructed in 2008 are still in excellent condition. Recently roads with heavy traffic have also 
been overlaid with 175 mm thick TWT. The project features in brief are as follows:
• 
Location: Road in front of Shivajinagar State Transport depot. Total length of the 
road is 1.26 km and carriageway width is 11.00 m ROW is 15/18 m.
• 
Type of Treatment: Thin White topping with thickness 175 mm M40 grade 
concrete overlaid on top of existing bituminous road after milling of 50 to 60 mm. 
• 
Panel Size: 1 m x 1 m panels created by saw cutting joints within 24 hours of 
casting. Width of TWT treatment is 8 m and hence 4 m wide concrete is cast first 
and then the balance 4 m width is cast after completion of curing and joint sealing 
(approx. 21 days) on other side. Longitudinal joint is not saw cut and butt joint is 
kept as it is.
• 
Dowel Bars and Tie Bars: Dowel bars are used only at the construction joint 
(25 mm bars at 250 mm c/c). Tie bars are used only at the center of the road 
(longitudinal joint 12 to 16 mm tor steel at 400 c/c)
• 
Existing Road Details: The existing road is in use for more than 25 to 20 years 
and consisted of well consolidated bituminous treatment of approx. 150 -160 mm 
thickness underlain by WBM of 250 to 300 mm thickness. Storm water arrangement 
in the form of 600 and 900 mm RCC pipes was present on the road. There were 
some locations with failure of base due to leakage of water supply line. The utilities 
like water supply main, distribution lines, sewer lines run along the carriageway 
edge and electrical cables, telephone cables, OFC etc run along the footpath. The

road caters to traffic of above 5000 buses daily on account of state transport and 
the city transport depots on this road. 
• 
Assessment of Existing Road: The Benkelman Beam Deflection study was 
carried out on the existing BT surface to design the bonded overlay treatment as 
per IRC:SP:76 and IRC:58 guidelines.
• 
Milling Operation and Pretreatment: Milling of existing BT road was done with a 
milling machine and 50 to 60 mm bituminous layer removed to lower the level of the 
road as well as creation of bond for concrete overlay. The portions which showed 
structural defects and settlement (approx. 1 to 2 percent of area) were completely 
excavated and new layers of hard moorum, GSB and DLC were provided. 
• 
Mix Design: M40 grade concrete was used for the work with fibrillated 
Polypropylene fibers. On-site slump of concrete, prepared in a RMC plant, was 
kept below 40 mm. The cement content and w/c ratio were kept at 420 kg per cum 
and 0.37 respectively.
• 
Construction Operation: Concrete was transported with transit mixer and 
placed, compacted with screed and needle vibrators. The mechanical trowel/ float 
was used for floatation and finishing operation. The texturing was done with the 
help of locally available brush. The joints were cut for 1/3rd depth within 24 hours 
and concrete was cured with water ponding for 21 days. Joints were sealed with 
polysulphide sealant after 21 days and opened to traffic. 
• 
Cost Breakup: Total project cost was Rs.7.24 crore with breakup is as follows:

Appendix VI
Typical Distresses in TWT/UTWT Pavements - Causes  
and remedial measures
CORNER BREAK/CORNER CRACKING
Cause
Remedy
Corner cracking 
appears to be 
the primary 
failure mode, and 
fatigue cracking 
is believed to 
be the primary 
failure mechanism 
in TWT/UTWT. 
Bonding is an 
important factor 
to long-term 
performance of 
the overlay. TWT/
UTWT provides 
small joint spacing 
to minimize 
restraint stress. 
However, joint 
locations and 
traffic loading 
should be given 
significant 
consideration. In 
case of loss of 
support from the 
underlying HMA 
layer over time, 
corner breaks 
are likely to occur 
under heavy 
wheel load.
Full-panel 
replacement is 
common repair 
strategy for the 
distressed panels 
of TWT/UTWT 
such as Corner 
breaks

TRANSVERSE CRACK
Late joint sawing, 
misalignment of 
the dowel bars at 
construction joints 
leads to transverse 
cracking.
Make 8-10 mm wide 
groove along the 
crack for a depth of 
20 mm and refilling 
with approved 
sealant.
DAMAGED UTILITY CHAMBERS
Cause
Remedy
Use of masonry 
to raise the utility 
chambers to 
the road level 
during overlay 
operation. Improper 
workmanship and 
lack of adequate 
protection of the 
edges of the utility 
chamber.
Raising of utility 
chambers likely 
to come in the 
carriageway should 
be done in concrete 
(preferably whole 
chamber should be 
recast in concrete).
Adequate 
protection of 0.3 m 
portion around the 
chamber should be 
strengthened using 
nominal steel mesh
DAMAGED LONGITUDINAL JOINT
Poor workmanship, 
bent steel formwork 
during construction 
and unprotected 
concrete edge 
after construction 
results in zigzag 
longitudinal joint 
which later on 
opens up and prone 
to damage after 
saw cutting.
Use good and 
strong formwork 
during construction 
and make sealing 
groove along 
the longitudinal 
construction joint
