FOREWORD
On y a few decades ago, roads in U,is country were largely built witli tlie Help
ofmanual labour and no mechanical equipment worU, die name was used except the
road rollers and trucks. The picture now is entirely different. Rigorous stanLds

far better
if machines are used right from buildJ,g up of u'e
embani™enttoU,elayingandfinishingoftheroadsurface.Thusmech;nisLonnot
only helps in quick execution but provides longer life and brings in substantial
economy in tlie maintenance cost.
»uosuiniiai
Large scale use ofroad making machinery was firstresorted to in die year 1 96
when several road projects were t:iken up for execution, to be completed within a
very tight time schedule and according to rigid specifications. As very litfirroad
making machinery was being manufactured in die country at diat time, most of it
had
to be
imported.
Since

PREFACE
(To the Second Edition)
The directory on this subject was first brought out in 1984. During the last
decade, there have been lot of improvements in the methodology and techniques in
the construction of road and bridge works. A number of large sized road and bridge
works are now being executed in India with financial assistance frc
World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, OECF Japan etc, deploying latest eq^iipmeiit. Rapid
mechanisation in the road sector has created a great demand of latest sophisticated
road/bridge construction machinery. To meet the demand, a large number of
indigenous manufacturers have
started manufacturing
latest road construction
machinery independently or in collaboration with foreign firms. This has, therefore,
necessitated updating of existing directory of manufacturers of road^ridge con-
struction machinery.
2. This Second Edition of the Publication has been renamed as
* 'Directory of
Indigenous Manufacturers of Road/Bridge Construction Machinery & Important
Bridge Components". A new Section containing "Names of the Companies and
their Products'
' has been added to it to improve the utility of the updated Directory.
3
. It may be noted Uiat the Directory is only intended to give ready information
about Road/Bridge Construction Machinery being manufactured in Uie country. The
firms enlisted may or may not be registered with Government Organisations like
Directorate General Supplies & Disposals, Director General Technical Develop-
ment and Small Scale Industries Department. This Directory should in no way be
taken as an approved list of suppliers of equipment.
4.
A number of individuals have contributed to the finalisation of this
directory. I would like to specifically place on record the untiring efforts put in by
S/Shri D.R. Gulati, Chief Engineer (Mech.), R.N. Malik, Superintending Engineer
(Mech.), B.D. Makkar, Executive Engineer (Mech.) in the Ministry.
5.
In
spite of
all
efforts,
Uiere may be shortcomings and
errors. Any
suggestions in this regard be sent to the Indian Roads Congress for necessary changes
in subsequent editions of tlie Publication.
