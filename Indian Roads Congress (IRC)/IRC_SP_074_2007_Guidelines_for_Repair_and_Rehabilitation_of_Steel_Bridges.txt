GUIDELINES FOR REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
OF STEEL BRIDGES
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The Steel and Composite Structures
Committee
(B-5)
of
the
Indian
Roads
Congress was reconstituted in 2006 with the
following personnel:

Secretary General, IRC
1.2.
At its first meeting held on 30^^ April,
2003, the former Steel Bridges Committee
(B-7) felt that in the light of renewed interest
in Steel and Composite Highway Bridges and
Flyovers, there is a need to bring out separate
documents for different types of superstruture
and also
for strengthening/rehabilitation of
old Steel Bridges which are
still in service.
Since
the IRC
document
"Guidelines
on
Techniques
for Strengthening and Rehabi-
litation of Bridges" (IRC:SP:40) does
not
comprehensively
cover
steel
bridges,
the
Committee felt that there is a need to bring out
a sperate document entitled "Guidelines for
Repair and Rehabilitation of Steel Bridges".
While highlighting the special requirements
for design and fabrication, it was decided that
the Guidelines would generally be in line with
relevant IRC Codes and Special Publications.
Additional inputs from pertinent AASHTO
Guide Specifications and Manuals, NCHRP
Reports, RDSO
Guidelines and
text book
were also considered in the preparation ofthe
Guidelines.
1.3
The
draft
of
the
Guidelines
was
prepared by a Sub-committee comprising of
the following members:
S/Sh.A. Ghoshal
Convenor
U.K. Ghosh
Member
Dr. T.K. Bandhyopadhyay
Member
K.N. Sreenivasa
Member
Dr. B.P. Bagish
Member
R.K.Goel
Member
The former B-7 Committee under the
Convenorship of Shri P.B. Vijay in its meeting
held on
12^^ December, 2005 had finalized
the
draft Guidelines
inviting comments,
if
any. The
draft was
referred
to
the newly
constituted Bridges Repair and Rehabilitation
Committee
(B-8)
by
the
IRC
for
its
comments, keeping
in view IRC:SP:40.
It
was vetted by the B-8 Committee, with minor
modifications
in
its meeting held on
11^^
March 2006. The newly constituted Steel and
Composite Structures Committee (B-5) in its
meeting held on 9^^ May, 2006 endorsed the
modified
draft
and recommended
for
its
placement before the Council through BS&S
Committee.

The draft document was approved by
the
Bridges
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
in
its
meeting
held
on
19^^^
October, 2006 and the Executive Committee
authorized Secretary General, IRC to place
the same before Council, The document was
approved by the IRC Council
in
its
179^^
meeting held on
18^^ November, 2006
in
Panchkula subject to incorporation of some
suggestions.
The B-5 Committee considered the
views ofthe Council in its meeting held on 9^'^
March, 2007 and
felt
that the
suggestions
were already in place in the document and
recommended
that
the document could be
published.
2.
SCOPE
The
topics
covered
in
the
present
document aim at restoring the bridges to their
originally intended service level or to retrofit
them
upto
capacity
presently
required.
Inadequacies could be due to various reasons:
(a)
Deterioration due
to various causes
e.g., corrosion, cracks, buckling etc.
(b)
Inherent structural deficiency
(c)
Deficiency due to introduction ofnew
loading and/or design criteria
(d)
Geometrical
inadequacy
due
to
changed traffic demand.
(e)
Inadequate design (loading standard)
(f)
Changes (increases) in magnitude of
loading, e.g., earthquake.
Assessment cf residual
fatigue
life
and rating of existing steel bridges form part
of maintenance activities and are not covered
in the present publication.
It also does not
cover replacement of an entire bridge, nor a
new construction.
For
rating
and
posting

bridges
reference is made to IRC
: SP:37.
3.
NATURE OF INADEQUACIES
3.1
DETERIORATION
Deterioration in steel bridges can be
classified according to two broad causative
factors,
viz,
natural
deterioration
and
deterioration due
to man-made
situations.
Examples of the fornier are those caused by
atmospheric
corrosion,
earthquake,
floods,
fire
etc.
Deterioration caused by pollution,
stress
corrosion,
fatigue,
deficiencies
in
material characteristics, foundation settlement,
accident, war, terrorist attack etc. come under
man-made situations.
In most of these situations, the effect
of distress depends on the type of the bridge,
details adopted, quality of the structure, type
of environment and above
all, the
level of
routine maintenance work.
3.1.1
Atmospheric corrosion
Atmospheric
corrosion
in
steel
is
essentially
an
electrochemical
process
of
flow of electricity and
consequent chemical
changes. Two important points are to be noted
in this connection:
-
Corrosion occurs only under concurrent
presence of water and oxygen.
In
the
absence of either, corrosion cannot occur.
-
All the corrosion occurs at the steel metal
itselfand not at the surface mill scales.
The
immediate
or
direct
effect
of
atmospheric corrosion is loss of area of either
the
steel member
itself
or
the
fasteners,
causing increase in stress in the member or the
fasteners. Indirectly, this makes the member
as well as the fasteners vulnerable to stress
corrosion and fatigue failure.
2



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
3.1.2.
Stress Corrosion
Locations
subjected
to high
tensile
stress are prone to higher rate of corrosion.
This phenomenon is commonly referred to as
'stress corrosion' As the cross sectional area
of an
already
highly
stressed member
is
reduced
due
to
corrosion,
the
resultant
increase in stress may initiate crack. This type
of distress is found mostly in specific areas
where
high
concentration
of
stress
is
developed,
such
as
eye
bars
of pins
in
suspension and cable stayed bridges.
3.1.3
Brittle fracture
Brittle fracture
is characterised by a
low
stress
fracture of the
material, which
usually
occurs
suddenly with
little
or no
plastic deformation and other warning signs.
There are three key factors which lead
to brittle fracture. These are
:
-
Metallurgical
feature
:
Depending
primarily
on
chemical
compositions
which
affect
Carbon
Equivalent
and
grain
size
and
heat
or
mechanical
treatments, some steels are less ductile
than
others
and
are
therefore
more
susceptible to brittle fracture.
-
Temperature
:
Brittleness
of
steel
increases
with
lowering
of
ambient
temperature
below
a
point
when
ductility transition occurs. Geographical
location
of
a
bridge
is
thus
very
important for examining this aspect. The
earlier
steels
were
more
susceptible
to brittleness.
-
Service
conditions
:
Brittle
fracture
can occur
at low service
stresses
as a
result of certain distribution pattern of
force fields, such as locations of stress
concentrations due to abrupt change of
sections, notches, holes, weld defects etc.
Also due to complex stress situations in
thicker plates, these plates carry higher
risk ofbrittle fracture.
3.1.4
Lamellar tearing
Lamellar tearing
is the separation of
parent metal caused by Through thickness'
strains
induced by weld
metal
shrinkage.
When the resultant
stress
is
carried
in the
'through
thickness'
direction,
any
lack
of
cohesive strength of the steel material in this
direction causes
the plate
to be
separated.
Shape of non-metallic
matter
in
the
steel
(manufacturing
defects)
as well
as
factors
related to welding process (e.g. Preheat, weld
restraint
in the through thickness
direction
etc.)
are
contributory
factors
for
lamellar
tearing of steel.
3.1.5
Fatigue Cracking
In
bridges,
steel
elements
are
subjected
to
moving
loads,
which
cause
fluctuations of stresses in steel elements. This
fluctuation of stresses reduces the ultimate
strength
of
steel member
considerably
as
compared
to gradually applied
static
load.
Thus, a member may be able to withstand a
single application of the design load, but may
fail if the same load
is repeated for a large
number
of
times.
This
phenomenon
of
progressive
localised permanent
structural
change due to fluctuating stresses, which may
initiate
cracks
in
the member,
is
termed
'fatigue'. This reduction in strength depends
on
two
factors,
viz.,
number
of
local
repetitions (cycles) and range of stress due to
these load repetitions
. Fatigue cracks occur at
the tension zone ofthe members. This tension
zone
varies
from member
to member
or
within
the same member, depending upon
application
of moving
loads.
Also,
this
phenomenon
is
applicable
to
connections/
joints which are subjected to load repetitions.
In welded joints, the fatigue strength
of steel tends to be reduced due to pronounced
changes
in
the
structure
(hard
grain
formation) in and around Heat Affected Zone
(HAZ) and properties (lowering of ductility)
of the steel due to improper or no treatment of
HAZ. As a result, welded bridges are more
prone
to
fatigue
cracks
than
riveted/High

IRC:SP:74-2007
Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolted ones.
Also, the crack developed at the weld tends to
progress and may affect both the connecting
components
and
surrounding
members/
elements/or connectors (due
to increase
in
stresses)
and
consequently,
the
entire
structure may be damaged.
In road bridges, the range of stresses is
not high, because of lighter moving loads
compared to dead loads and less vibration as
compared to railway bridges. Thus
fatigue
related
distresses
directly due
to range of
stresses are not very common in road bridges.
However, stress raisers in tension zone, such
as sharp notches or comers, abrupt change in
cross sections, can cause stress concentration.
Also atmospheric corrosion
in many cases,
reduces cross sections of members, resulting
in
increase
in
stress
levels,
which
for
a
particular loading cycle may initiate cracking
leading to fracture.
3.1.6
Damages due to accidents, floods,
earthquakes, etc.
Physical
damages
(buckling)
of
different bridge components due to accidents
are
quite common.
Steel bridges spanning
across
roadways
underneath
and
having
inadequate headroom are very often damaged
due
to vehicular collision from underneath
contact. In cases of through and semi-through
type steel bridges, vehicles using the bridge
may
damage
individual
members
while
passing. Also
there
are many examples of
vessels using waterways and colliding with
bridge structures from underneath.
Bridge may be damaged by natural
calamities
such
as
floods,
landslides,
earthquakes
or
by
explosions
from
war
action, sabotage etc.
For steel bridges supported by non-
ductile
substructure
elements,
at
these
locations supertructure has the likelihood of
getting
damaged
mostly
in
the
form
of
buckling
and/or
connection
fracture
of
diaphragm braces.
Steel sections can suffer slow erosion
due to weathering action,
viz., sand storm,
wave action etc.
In
industrial
areas,
chemical
corrosion may
occur
due
to
presence
of
chemicals (chlorides, oxides of sulphur etc.)
in the atmosphere.
All the above situations need to be
appropriately
examined
for
requisite
redressal.
3.2
Other Inadequacies
3.2.1
Inherent Structural deficiency
A
bridge
structure
may
suffer
inadequacy due
to under design
or
faulty
construction, needing strengthening.
3.2.2
New loading or design criteria
It
is
quite
common
that
heavier
loading
standards
and
changed
codal
requirements based on improved knowledge
are introduced from time to time, which may
render
the
bridge
structure
inadequate,
needing strengthening.
3.2.3
Geometrical inadequacy
It is sometimes necessary to introduce
increased vehicle clearance requirements to
meet
new
traffic
demands,
such
as
introduction
of new
types
of
vehicles,
container services etc.
This situation mostly
affects through
type
bridges,
necessitating
modifications in structural arrangements.
4
REPAIR AND REHABILITATION
PROCESS
The broad activities in this process are
1
.
Study ofthe bridge and its
environment.
2.
Locating damages/ defects/
deficiencies by inspection.
3.
Calculation of stress
level,

4.1
Study
of
the
Bridge
and
its
Environment
4.1.1
History of the bridge
This
activity
involves
study
of
available records and drawings pertaining to
the concerned bridge. If adequate records and
drawings
are
not
readily
available,
interviewing
old
employees
of
the
organisation
or
persons
residing
in
the
vicinity of the site of the bridge may provide
some
valuable
information.
The
data
of
construction and history of subsequent repair
work
or
replacement
of major members
should be ascertained at this stage.
The date of construction provides the
vital information about the age of the bridge.
Knowledge of age has
important bearings.
Some ofthese are
:
(a)
This may give some idea about the
material used in the construction and
influence whether a particular type of
repair work will be feasible or not. For
example, material with high carbon or
silicon content would preclude any
repair work by welding.
(b)
Age may
give
an
idea
about
the
loadings and stresses considered for
the original design on the basis of the
codes of practices prevalent
at
the
time ofconstruction.
(c)
Age and historic data may give an idea
about the number and magnitude of
load
cycles
the
bridge
has
been
subjected
to
and
thereby
the
proneness
to
fatigue
failure can be
assessed.
4.1.2
Environment
Review of the environment covers the
effect of the environment on
the
existing
bridge, as also the effect of the rehabilitation
work on the environment.
Regarding the former, the following
situations are relevant
:
(a)
Low
clearance between
the
lowest
point of the bridge and the highest
flood level (HFL).
(b)
Presence ofwater spray or moisture in
the
vicinity
such
as
waterfall
or
marshy wet land.
(c)
Presence of industrial
units
nearby,
which
emit
corrosive
fumes
or
discharge chemical effluents.
(d)
Presence
of
salinity
in
the
atmosphere.
The
rehabilitation
scheme
should
consider
these
environmental
hazards
and
recommend appropriate protective measures.
As regards the effect of rehabilitation
work on the existing environment, dumping
of debris, release of chemicals, spills ofwaste
materials should be avoided. These aspects
should be considered
at the planning stage
and
proper
specification
should
be
incorporated
in
the
bridge
rehabilitation
document itself
4.2
Locating
damages/
defects/
deficiencies by inspection
4.2.1
General
For
effective
rehabilitation
of
a
bridge, the first step is to locate the damages/
defects/ deficiencies incurred by
its various
components.
For
this
purpose
a
Special
Inspection
is
carried
out.
This
inspection
comprises ofthe following main activities
:
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
(a)
Measurement
of
the
overall
dimensions of the existing structure
including sections and thickness of all
main members.
(b)
Detection
of
defects
in
or
deterioration ofdifferent members.
(c)
Examination ofj oints and fastenings
(d)
Observation
of
the
behaviour
of
members and cracks when subjected
to vibratory loads.
4.2.2
Inspection personnel
Ideally the structural designer who is
entrusted
to
develop
the
rehabilitation
scheme should participate as a member of the
inspection team. This would enable him to
understand
the
condition of the
structure,
location and extent ofthe damaged area much
better than going through the report pages
prepared by someone else, and thus formulate
a better rehabilitation strategy. It is important
to note that certain components ofa bridge are
highly inaccessible. Therefore, reliable and
efficient working hands are to be included in
the inspection team to carry out the inspection
of such inaccessible
areas. When
it
is not
possible for the designer to inspect the bridge,
the inspection report assumes much higher
importance,
as
the
designer
has
to
fully
depend on
this
report
for
developing
his
strategy for rehabilitation.
The
bridge
inspector
should,
therefore, be conversant with the behaviour of
the structure under actual loading conditions.
He should be conversant with the design and
construction
features
of
the
structure.
Deterioration of material due
to corrosion,
weathering,
fatigue
etc.,
should be
easily
apparent to him. He should be able to identify
the areas which are prone to deterioration. He
should be able to properly interpret what
is
observed and
report
the same
correctly
in
clear language and by simple
sketches,
if
necessary.
It
is
often
preferable
to
form
an
inspection team comprising of engineers and
technicians, with experience and knowledge
of diverse
areas such
as
structural
design,
construction, maintenance, emergency repair
etc. Assistance of specialist agencies may also
be sought
to help the inspection team
for
special structures such as movable bridges,
suspension bridges, cable stayed bridges etc.
4.2.3
Areas to be inspected
While all the components of a bridge
need
inspection,
there
are
certain
areas,
connections and splices which are susceptible
to
serious
defects,
and
therefore
need
particular attention during inspection. Some
ofthese are
:
•
Members with high design stresses or
subjected to reversal of stresses
•
Members and joints where water may
get
collected
due
to
inappropriate
drainage system
•
Joints which are not easily accessible
to painting
•
Surfaces of the windward side of the
bridge situated near the sea
•
Notches in flange/ web at the ends of
stringers (for fatigue cracks)
•
Web members of through and semi-
through
truss members
for damage
due to collision from vehicular traffic
•
Camber oftrusses
•
Members which are closed type like
"box channels" etc., where the inner
side cannot be painted
•
Fatigue crack prone areas of welded
girders such as end of cover-plates in
flanges
with
multiple
plates,
butt-
welded connections of flange plates
of
different
thicknesses,
welded
splices,
fillet
welds
across
the
direction
of
tensile
stress,
intersecting welds, welds
at ends of
transverse and longitudinal stiffeners
and welds of attachments to web and
tension flange
or tension members,
bracing and cross frame connections
with stiffeners, etc.

4.2.4
Inspection tools
Some of the most useful inspection
tools are
: a 2m pocket tape, a 30m steel tape,
chipping hammer, paint scraper, wire brush,
plumb
bob,
vernier
or jaw type
callipers,
small level, steel straight edge, feeler gauges,
spanners,
wrenches,
rivet
testing hammer,
calibrated
torque
measuring
wrench
for
HSFG
bolts, magnifying
glass of (lOX or
higher magnification), binocular, flash light,
sensitive thermometer, mirror, piano wire and
camera. Precision type levelling instrument
and
theodolite
for
checking
camber/
deflection sway etc. may also be arranged if
necessary.
4.2.5
Inspection Equipment
For inspection of structural elements
situated above deck level, simple equipment
such as ladders, portable platforms, planks
etc. may be used for inspection. However, in
bridges where underside
structures are not
easily
accessible,
temporary
scaffolding
system,
special equipment such
as bucket
snoopers, custom made
travelling
gantries
etc.
are required to be used. Where access
from
roadway
below
is
available,
truck
mounted
hydraulically
operated
telescopic
hoists fitted with bucket or platfomi may be
usefully employed.
4.2.6
Visual Inspection
As
a
first
step
the bridge
structure
should be visually inspected. Most cracks are
first detected during
the
visual
inspection.
Visual inspection is carried out by naked eye,
or by using binoculars from
a convenient
location.
Usual
and
most
reliable
sign
for
detection of cracks during visual inspection is
the oxide or rust stains that develop
at the
crack after the paint film has cracked. At this
level of inspection only larger cracks will be
detected.
In
the
next
step,
close
visual
inspection of critical locations and suspect
details
(that show
no
visual
evidence
of
cracking through paint film) should be done
using magnifying
glass
of lOX
or higher
magnification. Cracks detected during earlier
inspections should also be inspected in detail
for their extension.
It may be necessary to
remove
the
paint
film
for
the
inspection;
however, this should be done carefully so that
any fine crack remains intact for detection.
4.2.7
Non-destructive Testing (NDT)
methods
For further detailed inspection, non-
destructive
testing
(NDT)
methods
are
generally employed. Some of the common
methods are briefly described below
:
(a)
Thickness measurement
:
The
remaining
thickness
of
a
corroded member can be measured
with
the
help
of
callipers,
where
access is available on both sides of the
member. Where such access
is not
available, ultrasonic thickness gauge
can be used. The equipment
is very
handy and can measure the thickness
from any one surface to an accuracy of
0.1mm. The gauge usually gives
a
digital reading.
(b)
Crack testing
Cracks
in
steel can be detected by
using
several
non-destructive
tests.
Some ofthese are described below
:
Dye penetration test
:
This test is a simple and low cost non-
destructive
testing
for
detecting
minute
surface cracks.
First the surface area is to be cleaned
to remove any dirt, rust or paint, to enable dye
penetrant
to
enter
into
the
crack. The dye
penetrant is then applied over the surface by
spraying or brushing. The dye seeps into any
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 36
======================================================================
IRC :SP: 74-2007
cracks or other defects open to the surface.
After allowing a penetration time of about 20
minutes, the excess penetrant
is cleaned by
using a
solvent. A developer
(like a chalk
powder)
of
contrasting
colour
with
high
absorbent quality is then applied by dusting.
In
case
of
any
surface
defect,
the
dye
penetrant
is drawn out from
the crack by
blotting action of the developer and appears
as stain on the chalk surface. Sufficient time is
to be allowed for the dye penetrant to blot on
the developer. The surface is then examined
by using a magnifying glass. The surface is to
be
finally
cleaned
after
the
test
(Ref:
18:3658:1981).
Ultrasonic Test
:
This method is suitable for detecting
surface or sub-surface defects in steel. A high
frequency sound beam is introduced into the
area to be tested by means of an ultrasonic
transducer. The sound beam travels through
the steel, and as soon as the crack is met,
it
reflects back to the transducer. This produces
a
voltage
impulse,
which
appears
in
the
cathode ray tube (CRT).
In this test access
from only one side of the material is required.
Since portable testing machines are available,
this test can be conveniently carried out at a
bridge
site.
However,
this
test
requires
specialised skill in interpreting the pulse-echo
pattern
appearing on
the
screen
(Ref:
IS-
3664:1981 and IS-4260: 1986).
Radiographic examination
:
In this method both surface and sub-
surface defects can be detected. X-rays or
Gamma rays are passed through the member
to be
tested, which
create an image on
a
photosensitive film. The defects are shown on
the film as dark lines of shaded areas. In this
method, permanent record of every
test
is
available.
Permanent
record can be made
available through radiographic examination
as compared to ultrasonic testing method. The
former
can
be
considered
more
reliable.
However,
for
radiographic
examination
access from both
sides of the
test area
is
required - with radiation source placed on one
side and the film placed on the other side.
It
requires specialised
skill in performing this
test (Ref:
IS-1 182:1983). Also,
strict safety
regulations are required to be observed during
this
examination.
For
protection
against
radioactivity refer IS:2598- 1 966.
Holography
Holography
is
a
variant
laser
technique used to obtain 3D images and
is
used as a tool for non-destructive testing of
materials. The detection of defects can be
observed
at
the
micro
level.
This
is
an
effective tool for testing in highly localised
zone and is quite effective in detection of the
location of flaw.
Magnetic Particle Test
:
This test
is suitable for detection of
surface or sub-surface cracks. In this method
magnetic field is first set up in the member to
be inspected by means of an electric power
source or permanent magnet. Fine dry iron
particles
are then dusted on
the
test
area.
Alternatively,
liquid
detection
medium
carrying magnetic iron powder can also be
used.
Crack
causes
discontinuities
in
magnetic field which results in a pattern of
collection ofiron particles along the crack and
the
outline
of the
crack becomes
clearly
visible. A highly trained inspector is required
to perform this test successfully. The method
is
only
effective
in
a
limited
range
of
situations and is normally not popular for use
in
field condifions (Ref: 18:3703:1980 and
18:5334:1981).
4.2.8
Testing for physical and chemical
properties
Sometimes, it is considered necessary
to carry out tests to establish the physical and
chemical properties of certain members of a
bridge. For example in cases of requirement
of welding repairs, the selection of electrode
would
depend
upon
the
chemical
composition of the steel. For this purpose a
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
specimen (coupon)
is taken from the
steel
structure
itself.
However,, these specimens
should not be taken indiscriminately from the
main members. These members should first
be checked by the designer vis-a-vis strength
and
stability.
In case a coupon
is obtained
from
a main member,
appropriate
bolted
repair
fulfilling
the
equivalent
sectional
requirement
at
a
particular
section
detail
should be designed and introduced.
4.2.9
Field load test and instrumentation
Sometimes, the static behaviour of a
bridge
is
examined
experimentally
by
applying actual or simulated design loadings
and
observing
the
effects
on
the
critical
members by instrumentation. Prior to loading
the structure, strain gauges are fixed at critical
locations. The
structure
is then loaded by
placing trucks and/or train of wheel loads of
known weights satisfying the requirements of
relevant IRC code
at various points of the
bridge and the strain is recorded. Based on the
strains
at
different
locations
the
actual
stresses in the members are calculated and
compared
with
the
theoretical
allowable
design stresses.
Testing may also be carried out by
passing
test
vehicles
over
a
bridge
at
incremental speeds
to ascertain the overall
behaviour
of
the
structure
under
normal
traffic load. Vibrations, opening of cracks in
damaged members, behaviour ofbearings are
some of the features that may be observed
during such tests. Measurements can be taken
by
various
types of instruments
including
electronic and laser techniques etc.
4.2.10 Safety aspects
During inspection, top priority must
be given to safety. It is necessary to draw out a
comprehensive
safety programme
well
in
advance of the proposed inspection activity.
This programme should cover the safety and
welfare of the persons
at work
as well
as
members
of
the
public
against
risks
to
accident, health and safety arising out of the
activities
at work. The programme should
include
standard
bridge
inspection
safety
procedures
of
the
concerned
bridge
authorities,
as
well
as
additional
safety
requirements
such
as
traffic
control
procedures to conform to local regulations.
Safety vests, helmets, work boots should be
used by every member ofthe inspection team.
Where climbing
is required, suitable safety
belts
should be
used.
Special
precautions
should be taken for night time work. A first aid
box should accompany the inspection team.
4.2.11
Photography
Clear and sharp photographs are very
useful
documents
to
support
bridge
inspection
report.
Thus modem
cameras
fitted with wide angle and telescopic lenses
are
very
useful
during
inspection.
It
is
advisable
to
include
in
the
photograph
a
clearly marked scale or an easily recognisable
item for easy comprehension of the scale of
the detail.
4.3
Calculation of stress level and
residual stress capacity
Based on the results of the inspection,
calculation of
stress
levels
for
all
critical
members of the bridge structure should be
carried out in respect of both dead and live
loads. The dead
loads
should
include
the
estimated load
for additional materials
for
repair and strengthening. Calculation of stress
levels would enable the designer to assess the
residual capacities of individual members and
joints
that are available
for
live loads and
other incidental loads and compare these with
the actual load effects on these members and
joints.
This
would
help
to
identify
the
members and joints which are deficient and
need strengthening.
To
assess
the capacity of joints by
calculations
is
more
difficult
since
the
inspectable parts ofthe joint are restricted and
also the design of joints mostly give rise to
stress concentrations and plastic (unknown)
9



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
redistribution of load between
the various
connectors
(i.e.
rivets,
bolts,
welds).
However, obvious deficiencies can be studied
for their effect on the capacity of the joint and
some measures to overcome defects can be
considered, if it can be reliably executed.
4.4
Design for Rehabilitation
This activity is carried out broadly in
two
stages,
viz., concept
stage and design
stage.
4.4.1
Concept stage
During this stage the various options
for solution are considered in detail. A few
relevant points need to be considered in this
context
:
-
It
is
necessary
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
the
cause
of
the
problem in order to arrive ataworkable
solution.
-
Practical aspect of implementation needs
to be considered. Also, a
solution using
standard equipment is preferable to one,
which needs special equipment.
-
Rehabilitation work
is generally labour
intensive. Thus, solutions, which can be
implemented easily by using minimum
specialist
labour
even
at
the
cost
of
higher material input, are almost always
the most economic solution.
-
In order to reduce the down time to the
minimum, partially fabricated units
(to
be assembled and fixed at site) should be
considered in preference to fabrication in
situ.
-
All above shall be in conformity to the
provisions inIRC:24-2001
4.4.2
Design Stage
Having
identified
a
few
viable
schemes
these
are
subjected
to
rigorous
analysis and design work in order to finalise
the strategy for rehabilitation. A few relevant
aspects are discussed hereunder
:
(i)
Dead load stresses
Members
of an
erected bridge
are
already
subjected
to
dead
load
effects.
Therefore prior to undertaking rehabilitation
work, the structure should be relieved of the
dead load.
If this
is not done, the existing
members will continue to carry the dead load
and will already be stressed to the extent of
dead load effect. Consequently, the capacity
of the new material will remain underutilised,
as
this cannot reach the permissible
stress
level
without
overstressing
the
existing
members.
In
case
it
is
not
practicable
to
relieve the dead load, the new material should
be considered to carry the live loads only.
There are a few methods for relieving
the dead load stresses of an existing bridge.
The most common method is to jack up the
girder
at
a
few
locations
and
provide
temporary support underneath.
Provision of temporary or permanent
external
prestress
is
also
a
very
efficient
method of relieving effect of D.L.. For cases
with
large heights and
also over perennial
rivers
the
external
prestressing
for
rehabilitation
of
bridges
has
definite
advantages.
(ii) Redundancy
and
fracture
critical
member
A
redundant
structure
has,
within
itself, a multiple load carrying mechanism, so
that, if one mechanism fails or weakens, the
load will be carried by another mechanism. A
non-redundant structure, on the other hand,
does
not
have
multiple
load
carrying
mechanism and
consequently
failure
of a
single
element
(fracture
critical
member)
may cause collapse ofthe structure.
The
failure of any joint
will have
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
similar effect. The joints are more difficult for
inspections
and
repair.
Hence,
providing
alternative
paths
for
load
transfer
is
an
important
consideration
in
evolving
rehabilitation strategy.
(iii) Fatigue effect
Fatigue
effect should be considered
while developing the
rehabilitation
details.
Some of the
details which need particular
attention include stress raisers in tension zone
such
as
notches,
sharp
comers,
sudden
changes in cross sections which cause stress
concentration etc.
While developing welded details for
rehabilitation, the following recommendations
would help in reducing fatigue related cracks:
•
Butt
welds
are
preferable
to
fillet
welds
•
Fillet welds across the
direction of
stress should be avoided
•
Intersections
of
longitudinal
and
transverse welds should be avoided
(iv) Connections
New fasteners should be compatible
with the existing fastening system
. As far as
possible
welding
should
be
avoided
on
existing riveted/bolted connections. If used,
welding should be designed to transfer entire
load. However, before selecting welding as an
option,
weldability
of the
parent
material
must be ascertained first.
Defective rivets are best replaced by
turned and fitted bolts, as the load transfer
behaviour ofthese bolts are nearly identical to
that of rivets.
If, However, High
Strength
Friction
Grip (HSFG)
bolts
are
used
the
efficacy
of
the
existing
rivets
should
be
checked.
(v)
Eccentricity
While
adding
new
materials
for
strengthening an existing damaged member,
care should be taken to ensure that the centre
of
gravity
of
the
strengthened
section
coincides, as far as possible, with the centre of
gravity of the
original
section,
in order to
avoid secondary stresses due to eccentricity.
In
case
it
is
not
possible
to
achieve
this
requirement, the effect of eccentricity should
be considered in the design.
4.5
Drawings and Specifications
Drawings
and
specifications
for
rehabilitation
scheme
prepared
by
the
engineer should be clear and unambiguous.
All
details
as
also
sequence
of proposed
operation at site should be clearly indicated in
the drawings and specifications. The working
drawings prepared by the contractor should
be based on the engineer's conceptual design
drawings,
but
must
follow
the
actual
measurements at
site. The drawings shouk
clearly
indicate
the
scope
of work
foi
inclusion of new element and/or deletion o
existing
elements
satisfying
the
desigi
requirements. Also, drawings should clearb
specify and demarcate the existing and nev
elements ofthe structure.
4.6
Workmanship
Fabrication and erection of every par
of the work should be done most accurately,
so
that
the
parts
fit
properly
together on
erection. Flame cutting and/ or dismantling of
existing members should be done carefully so
as not
to damage the adjacent
steel work.
While
dismantling
existing
members,
adequate
temporary
supports
should
be
provided
to
ensure
stability
of the
entire
structure. Care should be taken to eliminate
any
differential
settlement
between
temporary supports.
4.7
Implementation at site
Implementation
of
a
rehabilitation
scheme for an existing bridge is mostly a time
bound
project.
Therefore,
prior
detailed
planning
and
proper
monitoring
during
implementation are imperative for successful

completion ofsuch a project.
In
a
rehabilitation
work,
certain
problems not envisaged earlier, may arise at
site and the supervisory team at site is often
called upon to solve such problems on the
spot. The team at site should therefore be well
equipped to meet such contingencies.

REMEDIAL SOLUTIONS FOR
COMMON INADEQUACIES
This
section
briefly
deals
with
suggested
remedial
solutions
for
inadequacies that commonly occur in existing
steel bridges. The items covered are
:
(a)
Repair ofdeficient members
Conosion
Cracks
Buckling and bending
(b)
Upgrading the structure for increased
loading:
Stepwise
Strengthening
of
deficient
components
(A
useful
and
economic
strategy
to
follow is strengthen the weakest member
to raise the overall capacity to that of 2"^
Weakest member's and proceed
in
this
manner
to
3'"^,
4^^
weakest
members)

5.1
Repair of Deficient Members
5.1.1
Corrosion
Corrosion is the most common cause
of damage
in
existing
steel
bridges.
The
solution
for
rehabilitation
of
a
corrosion-
damaged member depends primarily on the
degree of corrosion and
its extent over the
surface
area.
Some
typical
solutions
for
damage due to corrosion are described below:
(a)
When top flange of a beam or girder is
damaged due
to
corrosion,
a
steel
plate ofadequate size is provided over
the
top
flange and
secured
to
top
flange by bolts, using the holes of the
existing
rivets
after
reaming
as
necessary. Use ofhigh strength turned
and
fitted
bolts
are
generally
preferred over other types of bolts,
since these bolts can be made to
fit
tightly (slip free) to match the existing
rivet holes and thus their behaviour
pattern becomes somewhat identical
to that of the other adjoining existing
rivets.
This
ensures
satisfactory
transmission
of
forces
to
the
additional material.
(b)
Web
plates
of
a
beam
or
girder
damaged
due
to
corrosion
can
be
repaired by fixing corrosion plates of
adequate
size,
preferably
on
both
sides of the web and securing these by
high strength turned and fitted bolts.
The
details of the arrangement will
depend on
the
location,
extent and
degree ofthe damage.
(c)
Corroded secondary members, such
as lateral bracings, can be repaired by
fixing corrosion plates on the bracing
angles at the location of damage by
means of bolts.
However, when a
bracing member is badly corroded at a
number of locations, it is preferable to
replace the member rather than repair
it.
(Some
of
these
measures
are
illustrated in Fig.
1 to4oftheAnnexure.)
5.1.2.
Cracks
Cracks occurring in isolated locations
can be repaired by drilling a hole of 13.5 to
23.5mm diameter at about 20mm beyond the
12



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
tip of the crack, along
its assumed line of
further
progress,
to
arrest
the
crack
propagation.
This
will
generally
be
a
temporary repair and should be followed by
fixing
splice
plates
or
splice
angles
with
adequate number of bolts on either side of the
crack. This
is a very common solution for
isolated cases of cracks. For multiple cracks
in a single member
it may be desirable to
replace the cracked member by an identical
member. Alternatively only the portion of the
member, which has been damaged, may be
replaced and an adequate splice connection
between the new part and the existing part
may be provided.
In welded girders, typical cracks may
occur in the web near the lower end of the
welded stiffener connection to the web. These
cracks
can
be
repaired by
drilling
holes
beyond the tips of the crack and then gouging
out the cracked portion and depositing weld
metal in its place, followed by removing the
excess
metal
by
grinding.
However,
for
undertaking
field
welding,
the
chemical
composition of steel should be ascertained
and appropriate electrode should be chosen in
consultation with experts. A suitable, bolted
splice on the other face of the web would
provide added strength.
(Some ofthese measure are illustrated
in Fig. 5 to 7 ofthe Annexure)
5.1.3
Buckling and Bending
Local
Buckling
and
bending
of
members due to vehicle collision or accident
may be rectified either by mechanical means
or by application of heat. However, the latter
method is not popular amongst technicians.
For
mechanical
straightening,
the
recommended process is to slowly apply heat
in the damaged area and then straighten it by
mechanical means avoiding impact load. The
member
should
then
be
allowed
to
cool
without
application
of
any
external
aid.
Straightening
of
the
member
without
application
of
heat
(i.e.
in
ambient
temperature) is generally not recommended,
as the heavy external loads required for this
process might adversely affect the properties
ofsteel.
5.2
Upgrading
the
Structure
for
Increased Loading
In general, the procedures available
for
upgrading
the
structure
for
increased
loading are:
5.2.1
Strengthening
of
Deficient
Components
Capacities of rolled beams and plate
girders can be
increased by adding cover
plates to the top and bottom flanges near the
midspan.
Lengths of the cover plates and
their cut-off points are to be determined by
design check.
In case of rolled beams and
welded plate girders the cover plates can be
welded.
However, in order to avoid fatigue
related cracks,
it
is preferable to extend the
cover
plates
to
the
ends,
instead
of
terminating these
at the
theoretical cut-off
point.
For riverted plate girders, cover plates
are to be fixed by bolts in a similar manner
described in clause 5.1.1. above
For
truss
bridges,
capacities
of
deficient main members
such
as
top and
bottom chords, diagonals and verticals can be
enhanced by providing additional steel areas
to these members by bolting plates
to the
webs or flanges ofthe members.
5.2.2
Introduction
of
Supplementary
Members
Capacity
of top
chords
and
other
compression members ofa truss bridge can be
increased by reducing the effective lengths of
these members.
This
can be
achieved by
subdividing the panels by introducing new
members.
5.2.3
Reduction ofDead Load
Live load capacity of a bridge can be
13



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
increased if the dead load of the structure
is
reduced.
One
common
example
of
this
solution
is replacement of the existing RC
deck slab by orthotropic steel deck system.
5.2.4
Modification of Structural System
Capacity of an existing bridge can be
increased by
incorporating changes
in
the
details, so as to modify its structural system.
For
example,
simply
supported
spans
of
longitudinal
stringer
beams
in
the
deck
system can be converted to continuous beams
by
suitably modifying
the end connection
details, thereby improving their load carrying
capacity. Another method of augmenting the
capacity of an existing bridge is by providing
additional supports from below the underside
of the girder at one or more points.
Similarly,
shifting of support points from the ends of the
bridge
to the next inward panel point may
increase the capacity of the girder.
The new
configuration would be a reduced span with
cantilevered panels
at
the
ends.
Another
innovative method
for increasing
the
load
carrying capacity of an existing bridge is by
introducing counterbalancing
forces
in
the
structural system by means of external post-
tensioning tendons, which work much
the
same way
as
in
a post-tensioned
concrete
beam. This procedure induces new stresses in
the structure and reduces the effects of the
existing dead or live loads on the structure.
Thus the live load capacity of the bridge
is
increased.
5.3
Modification
for
Increase
of
Clearance Dimensions
Existing through
type
bridges may
need
modifications
to accommodate
such
requirements.
End portal systems and sway
bracings are the most common members that
are
affected.
These components would be
required
to be relocated
to clear
the new
dimensions.
In
case space
is not available
within the structure,
it may be necessary to
place the portal bracings and sway bracings
above the bridge structure and fix these on to
stools placed over the top chords
at node
points to clear the new clearance diagram.
It
is necessary
to carry out design checks
to
ensure that the adopted system is adequate to
transmit the
lateral forces from the top chords
to the bearings.

connections

modifications/

BEARINGSAND BED BLOCKS
COMMON PROBLEMS AND
REMEDIAL SOLUTIONS
Bearings
are
primarily
required
to
transmit loads to the foundations and to allow
movements of the supporting superstructure.
Although
relatively
small
components
in
bridge
structures,
these
are
of
significant
importance for the proper functioning of any
bridge.
In many occasions
distress
in
the
superstructure
as
well
as
in
substructures
have
been
found
to
be
due
to
improper
functioning of the bearings. In this section,
some of the common problems
associated
with bearings and
their remedial
solutions
have been discussed.
6.1
Corrosion
As
discussed
earlier,
corrosion and
rusting in steel are mostly caused by water,
dust and debris, which often collect
at the
location of bearings, have the tendency
to
absorb and retain moisture and thereby cause
corrosion.
Therefore,
it
is
imperative
to
ensure
that
debris
are
not
allowed
to
accumulate at the location ofbearings.
Heavy
corrosion
on
the
contact
surfaces increases the coefficient of friction
significantly,
thereby
impeding
the
movement of sliding plates or
rollers, and
rendering
the
bearings
ineffective.
Often
smaller components such as tooth bars or pins
get corroded, resulting
in restriction
in the
movement ofthe bearing.
14



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
When bearings show effects of severe
corrosion, these may need temporary removal
and thorough check
up.
These
should be
rehabilitated
by
replacing
damaged
components, if necessary, and then re-erected
after
painting
and
greasing.
Where
components do not show any major loss of
section due to corrosion, they may need only
cleaning in situ and greasing.
6.2
Misalignment
Misalignment of bridge bearings may
restrict the movements of the superstructure
and induce additional
forces
in the bridge
structure.
Misalignment
is
caused
by
excessive vibration of the superstructure due
to moving loads, severe earthquake, error in
setting the bearings defective fabrication, or
non
linear
and
non-ductile
substructure
movement
due
to
severe
earthquakes
or
settlement offoundation due to overload.
A
misaligned
bearing
can
be
rehabilitated by
first jacking up the bridge
superstructure
to
relieve
the
load on
the
bearing,
introducing
temporary
props
to
support the structure, and then re-setting the
bearing components with correct alignment,
giving due consideration to the temperature
effect
for
the
inclination
of
the
rollers.
Normally jacking points are pre-located in a
steel bridge. However, in case these are not
available
in
a particular bridge,
it
will be
necessary to develop suitable jacking points,
considering the
stability of the bridge and
adequacy of the concerned member
to be
jacked.
6.3
Tilting ofBearings
Tilting of bearings may be due to the
movement of either the substructure or of the
superstructure
or
both.
In
either
case,
remedial
measures
for
such
movements
should be
implemented
first,
prior
to
re-
setting of the tilted bearing. Otherwise, the
problem may
recur
after some
time.
Re-
setting of tilted bearings can be done in the
similar manner
as
in
case
of misaligned
bearings. Also, the movements can take place
due to occurance ofsevere earthquake.
6.4
Damage in Bed Blocks
The concrete bed blocks are subj ected
to significant vertical and horizontal forces.
Consequently, these
locations
in many old
bridges have been found to deteriorate. This
may be due to lack of proper and uniform
contact between the underside of the bedplate
and the top of the bed block or due to severe
earthquake. Repeated impact loads from the
vehicles due to poor roadway surface above
the misaligned deck joints may aggravate the
situation. Malfunctioning of bearings due to
reasons discussed earlier may also add to the
distress.
Before undertaking repair work, the
cause of the distress in bed blocks should be
investigated. Damaged bed blocks should be
repaired, or if necessary even replaced, using
stronger concrete mix. For this purpose, the
superstructure has
to be
first jacked up
to
relieve the loads, and supported on temporary
props.
The bearings should be reinstalled
only after the concrete has hardened.
6.5
Replacement
When a bearing suffers major defects
such as severe corrosion in rollers, cracks in
main
components
etc.
it
is
advisable
to
replace such a bearing
in
its
entirely. Also
when a bridge is situated in a remote place, it
may be easier and cheaper to replace a bearing
rather than to repair
it. Furthermore, in non-
standard
bridges
(such
as
bridges
with
excessive skew), bearings
are subjected to
multidirectional
rotations
and
existing
traditional bearings are not designed for such
conditions. In such cases the existing bearing
would
need
replacement
by
modern
elastomeric or pot or spherical bearings, to
accommodate this type ofmovement.
The
following
points
need
to
be
considered
in the event of replacement of
15



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
bearings:
•
The height of the new bearings has to fit
the existing available height.
•
The
new
bearing
must
satisfy
the
required
functional
demands
viz.
horizontal and/or rotational movements
as necessary.
•
In case existing bearings are replaced by
new bearings with elastomer materials,
the horizontal force on the substructure
may change. Therefore, the adequacy of
the
substructure should be checked
in
such a case.
7.
POST REHABILITATION
MAINTENANCE
As in the case of a newly constructed
steel bridge, a rehabilitated bridge also needs
to
be
protected
from
the
hazards
of
deterioration
due
to
natural
as
well
as
manmade situations, so that the investment
made
for
rehabilitation
is
not
wasted
prematurely. Introduction of a well-planned
and monitored inspection and maintenance
regime
is
therefore
necessary
for
all
rehabilitated
bridge
structures.
Such
a
system
commonly
termed
'Bridge
Management System (BMS)' would ensure
periodic
inspection
and
recording
of
the
current state of the structure and would keep
the
authorities
informed,
on a continual
basis,
about
the
condition of the
bridge
structure for taking timely remedial action.
Requirements for routine inspection
and
maintenance
of
bridges
have
been
covered
in
other
published
literature
(e.g.IRC:24-2001,
IRC:SP:18
and
IRC:SP:35).
These
are,
therefore,
not
repeated
here.
This
section
is
intended
primarily
to
provide
guidelines
for
preventative maintenance repainting needed
for rehabilitated old steel bridges.
7.1
Frequency of Inspection
The frequency and level of inspection/
monitoring
of rehabilitated
bridge
girders
should be as laid down in IRC:24-2001 with
the following modifications.
1 )
Two detailed inspections ofthe bridge
should be carried out
: one six months
after the bridge is put to traffic use and
the next after another six months.
2)
Thereafter periodic routine inspection
should
be
carried
out
every
three
years.
3)
In
special
cases
the
competent
authority
should
lay
down
the
frequency and level of inspection.
7.2
Maintenance Repainting
7.2.1
Common Problems
It has been noticed from experience
that
quite
often,
areas,
which
are
easily
accessible,
are
painted
regularly,
whereas
areas, which are not so easily accessible, do
not
receive
proper
attention.
Thus
areas,
which have easy access,
are generally not
rusted over the years. On the other hand the
inaccessible parts
are often corroded. This
aspect
needs
to
be
carefully
considered
during maintenance repainting.
It
is necessary to remove all dirt, oil
and rust from the surface of the member prior
to application of the fresh coating. In case of
heavy rusting, due attention should be given
to ensure that the loss of sectional area is not
beyond the permissible limit, in which case
the member may have to be strengthened by
adding corrosion plate prior to painting.
Another
aspect
needing
careful
consideration is excessive number ofcoatings
on a member. Although thick coatings may
appear to provide more protection to the steel
surface,
it may, in fact, be counterproductive,
leading to cracking and flaking of the coat.
This condition may need removal ofthe entire
coating in the affected location.
The
initial painting system adopted
for
a
bridge
structure and
the
quality
of
maintenance
painting
done
over
the
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:74-2007
subsequent
period,
have
considerable
influence
over
the
efficiency
of
the
maintenance
repainting
work
being
done
currently. If the original painting system was
inadequate for the service condition, or the
workmanship was not upto the desired level,
efficient
repainting
work
becomes
rather
difficult,
similarly, inadequate maintenance
over the years may need extensive cleaning
and often repair work entailing large scale
patch painting prior to final coats ofpainting.
7.2.2
Selection of Protective System
If the performance
of the
existing
paint
is
satisfactory,
the
same
paint
is
normally applied over the existing one.
In
case, however, the existing painting system is
not satisfactory,
it may be necessary to go in
for
a new
one.
In
such
a
situation
the
following aspects need careful consideration:
(a)
Compatibility
The new protective system must be
compatible with the existing system.
Otherwise
the new
coat may
not
adhere to the existing one for a long
period. Also, the existing paint may
need
special
abrasive
treatment
to
make the surface uneven to hold the
new maintenance coat.
(b)
Environment
For selection of a coating system, the
following
aspects
need
particular
consideration:
•
Environmental
conditions
such
as
polluted or non polluted, saline or non
saline
•
Local
conditions
such
as
intermittent
splash
of water,
presence
of harmful
salts, fungi or bacteria etc.
•
Likelihood
of impact or abrasion from
water borne debris
(c)
Availability of the System
The new
coating
system
and
the
facilities for its application are easily
available
to
avoid delay
in
overall
progress.
(d)
Access of the Bridge
Bridges
situated
in
remote
areas
where access for maintenance is both
difficult
and
expensive,
a
more
^
durable
coating
system
may
be
preferable, even if the
initial cost
is
more.
(e)
Ease of application
This aspect
is particularly important
where
there
is
shortage
of
skilled
workmen. In such cases, systems not
requiring specialist operators (for say,
blast cleaning) would be preferable.
(f)
Economy
For
financial
evaluation
of
the
protective system, the
initial cost as
well as the future maintenance costs
should be considered for evaluating
the total cost. For this purpose total
Life
Cycle
Costs
(LCC)
of some
prima facie suitable systems should
be calculated and compared.
It has
often been found that, in an aggressive
environment or where the bridge
is
situated in a remote and inaccessible
location, a special corrosion resistant
painting
system,
with
longer
durability property, but with higher
cost
range may prove
to be more
economic
over a period of time
if
analyzed with life cycle cost method.
(g)
Other factors
Some of the other factors which need
consideration are:
•
Appearance
(after final coat) vis-a-vis
the surroundings.
•
Time
required
to
apply
the

Surface Preparation Prior to
Repainting
As
in
the
case
of
a new
bridge
structure,
surface
preparation
is
very
important to make the new coating system
effective.
Unless
the
surface
is
properly
cleaned and made
free from
rust or other
chemicals, corrosion under the new coating is
likely to start again.

Non-destructive

New Test
Acoustic Emission Technique
Acoustic Emission (AE) technique
is one of the
latest non-destructive
testing (NDT)
methods, which can be gainfully used for assessment of the condition of steel bridges. The
technique is already in use for monitoring cracks in steel bridges in Western countries. Also,
the technique is being used widely for monitoring corrosion and leak detection in aircraft
and oil industries as well as in the atomic research centres and rocket industry in India.
Acoustic Emission (AE) relates to elastic waves generated by a sudden redistribution of
stress in a material. These waves propagate to the surface and are recorded by sensors. AE
can result from the initiation and growth of cracks,
slip and dislocation movements etc.
Initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks can thus trigger AE. Detection and conversion
of the elastic waves (related to AE) to electrical signals is the basis ofAE testing. Analysis
of these
signals
yield
valuable
information
regarding
the
origin
and
importance of
discontinuity in a material. This test can be carried out on line, requiring only limited time.
This helps in identifying the affected region of crack including inaccessible areas.
AE technique can only gauge the damage qualitatively.
In order to get quantitative results
(size, depth and overall acceptability), other NDT methods, such as ultrasonic
testing,
radiographic testing etc. are necessary. Another practical drawback ofAE technique arises
from loud extraneous noise in service environments.
