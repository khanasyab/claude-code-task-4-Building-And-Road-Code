CHAPTER
1
ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK
1.1
Preamble
The construction of new roads and/or up-gradation of existing roads
is associated
with various adverse environmental and social innpacts. Construction and operational
activities of road projects fall under the purview of various environmental and social
regulations promulgated from time to time by the Government of India and the State
Governments. Design consultants, contractors, concessionaire and road project
implementation agencies need to be aware about the applicable environmental and
social regulations and their safegaurds, so that design, construction and operation of
roads can comply with the applicable
regulations. Awareness about applicable
environmental and social regulations with respect to road projects helps
in timely
accordance of necessary clearances/compliances to avoid delay
in construction/
up-gradation
of
road. As ready reference
for road designers,
contractors,
concessionaires and project implementation agencies, environmental and social legal
requirements for roads/highways are described in following sections.
1.2
Environment and Social Legal Framework
Even before
India's Independence
in
1947, several environmental and
social/
resettlement related legislations existed but the real impetus for bringing about a well-
developed framework came only after the UN Conference on the Human Environment
(Stockholm, 1972). Under the influence of this declaration, the National Council for
Environmental Policy and Planning within the Department of Science and Technology
was set up
in 1972. The Department of Environment was established
in 1980 and
later evolved into a full-fledged Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) in
1 985,
which today is the apex administrative body in the country for regulating and ensuring
environmental protection. After the Stockholm Conference,
in 1976, constitutional
sanction was given to environmental concerns through the 42"^ Amendment, which
incorporated them into the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Rights
and Duties.
Since the 1970s an extensive network of environmental legislation has grown in the
country. However, legal framework for social aspects was limited to the land acquisition,
protection
of scheduled areas and backward classes. The following subsections
describe relevant legal framework within which the road development works would be
designed and implemented.

IRC:SP:93-2011
1.3
Enforcement Agencies for Environmental Regulations
1 .3.1
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF)
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) is the key ministry of the Government
of India (GOI) responsible for the preparation and implementation of the legislation to
mitigate and control environmental pollution. The specific functions of MOEF are as
follows:
•
environmental policy planning;
•
ensure effective implementation of legislation;
•
monitoring and control of pollution;
•
environmental clearance for industrial and development projects;
•
promotion of environmental education, training and awareness; and
•
forest conservation and development and wildlife protection.
MOEF, through its six regional offices located in the country, state forest departments
and also through Central and State Pollution Control Boards, monitors the conditions
stipulated in the clearance letter issued by MOEF, while granting approval to various
projects.
In addition to existing protected areas, reserved forests and protected forests, the
MOEF can notify certain areas as ecologically sensitive/fragile and all development
projects which are to be located in these notified areas need to obtain environmental/
statutory clearances. Areas so far notified include some coastal areas identified under
the coastal regulation zone notification, forest, wild
life sanctuaries, national parks,
wet lands, mangroves and ecosensitive zone.
1 .3.2
Central Pollution Control Board
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) basically design the scheme, procedures
and standards to control the water, air & noise pollution, land degradation and hazardous
substances and waste management. The executive responsibilities for the industrial
pollution prevention and control are primarily executed by the CPCB at the Central
level, which is a statutory body. The specific functions of CPCB are as follows:
•
advise the MOEF on matters concerning prevention, control and abatement
of water and air pollution;
•
co-ordinate the activities of State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB) and provide
them with technical and research assistance;
3



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 120
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
•
prepare manuals, codes and guidelines relating to treatment and disposal of
sewage and trade effluents as well as for stacks gas cleaning devices, stacks
and ducts;
•
establish and keep under review quality standards for surface & groundwater
and for air and noise quality;
•
planning and execution of national program for the prevention, control and
abatement of pollution through the Water and Air Acts; and
•
perform such other function as may be prescribed by the Government of
India.
1.3.3
State Pollution Control Boards
The State Pollution Control Borard (SPCB)s were constituted to implement the Acts in
respective States of the Indian Union. The SPCBs also provides advisory support to
the Department of Environment in the States on Environmental Policy matters. The
SPCB implements and enforces the policies of the Department of Environment
in
addition to those formulated by the MOEF. The specific functions of SPCB are as
follows:
•
planning and execution
of State wide program for prevention,
control and
abatement of water and air pollution;
•
advise the State Government on prevention, control and abatement of water
and air pollution and siting of industries;
•
ensure compliance with the provisions of relevant environmental legislation;
•
establish and review local effluent and emission standards;
•
ensure legal action against defaulters; and
•
develop cost effective methods
for treatment, disposal and
utilization
of
effluent.
1 .3.4
Coastal Zone Management Authority
Coastal Zone Management Authorities have been set up both at National and State/
Union Territory
levels. The objective of these authorities
is to take measures for
protecting and improving the quality of coastal environment and preventing, abating
and controlling environmental pollution in coastal areas. Highways passing through
coastal regulation zones need to take clearance from state costal zone management
authority and the central coastal zone authority.
1 .3.5
National Board for Wildlife
The National Board for Wildlife NBWL is the apex advisory body in the field of wildlife
conservation in the country and is headed by the Prime Minister of India.

======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 120
======================================================================
1RC:SP:93-2011
The NBWL takes decision regarding the impact on wildlife due to road development
activities and issues recommendations related to proposed road up-gradation.
1.3.6
The Archaeological Survey
of
India
(ASI), has been formed
for the
archaeological researches and protection
of the cultural heritage
of the
nation.
Maintenance of ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains of national
importance is the prime concern of the ASI.
It regulates all archaeological activities
and development works
in and around archeological sites in the country as per the
provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act,
1 958.
1 .3.7
Central Ground Water Board
In order to have a scientific approach in giving environmental clearance of the industries
and infrastructure projects, norms are made for ground water extraction. As a part of
regulatory measures by CGWA under EPA 1 986 rules and regulations, directions are
given to pollution control boards who are having regular monitoring of the industrial
pollution including the assessment of land, water and air environment to insist the proper
water management by the industries.
1.4
Primary Environmental and Social Legal Framework Legislation
1„4J
Environmental Legal Framework Legislation
The Constitution of India directs the State to endeavor to protect and improve the
environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the country.
Article 51 A(g) of
the Constitution states that
it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and
improve the national environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to

Description of Key Environmental Legislations
Brief description of key environmental regulations related to road projects is as given
below:
1.6.1
The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
The Environment (Protection) Act (EPA), 1986, under the jurisdiction of the Indian
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) is officially considered to be the umbrella
legislation to regulate environment degradation and pollution.
It also attempts to provide
a critical framework to enable the coordination of bodies such as Pollution Control
Boards set up through air and water related legislations that precede the EPA. The
enactment of the EPA is directly linked to the commitments India made at the United
Nations Conference on Human Environment held in Stockholm in June,
1 972. The EPA
10



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 120
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
primarily empowers the central government to takemeasures necessary to protect and
improve the quality of environment by setting standards,
regulating the
siting
of
industries and so on.
The EPA is less known for its role in environmental protection and prevention of damage
through land use planning and safeguarding certain areas against the pressures of
commercial exploitation. Section 3(2)(v) of the Act empowers the central government
to take all such measures that
it deems necessary to protect and improve the quality
of the environment and prevent environmental pollution.
It allows for the restriction of
areas
in which certain developmental activities can be prohibited. Further, section
5(1 ) of the Environment (Protection) Rules (EPR),
1 986, specifies certain criteria like
topographic and
climatic features
of an area,
biological
diversity of the area,
environmentally compatible land use, extensive cultivation, proximity to the protected
areas, etc. that can be considered while prohibiting or restricting certain operations in
different areas.
Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 (EPA) gives power to tlie Central
Government i.e. the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to take all measures
that it feels are necessary for protecting and improving the quality of the environment
and to prevent and control environmental pollution. To meet this objective, the Central
Government can restrict areas in which any industries, operations or processes or
class of industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried
out subject to certain safeguards [Section 3(2)(v)]
Section 5(1) of the Environment (Protection) Rules,
1986 (EPR), states that the
central government can prohibit or restrict the location of industries and carrying on
certain operations or processes on the basis of considerations like the biological
diversity of an area (clause v) maximum allowable limits of concentration of pollutants
for an area (clause
ii) environmentally compatible land use (clause
vi) proximity to
protected areas (clause
viii).
1.6.2
The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986
These rules lay down the procedures for setting standards of emission or discharge of
environmental
pollutants. The Rules prescribe the parameters for the Central
Government, under which
it can issue orders of prohibition and restrictions on the
location and operation of industries in different areas. The Rules lay down the procedure
for taking samples, serving notice, submitting samples for analysis and laboratory
reports. The functions of the laboratories are also described under the Rules along
with the qualifications of the concerned analysts.

IRC:SP:93-2011
1 .6.3
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and Rules,
1974, 1975
This Act represented India's first attempt to comprehensively deal with environmental
issues. The Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants into water bodies beyond a given
standard, and lays down penalties for non-compliance. The Act was amended in
1 988
to conform closely to the provisions of the EPA, 1986.
It set up the Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) which lays down Standards for the Prevention and Control of
Water Pollution. At the State level, the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) function
under the direction of the CPCB and the State Government.
1 .6.4
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution} Cess Act, 1977
This Act provides for a levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries
and local authorities.
It aims at augmenting the resources of the Central and State
Boards for prevention and control of water pollution. Following this Act, The Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules were formulated in
1 978 for defining
standards and indications for the kind of and location of meters that every consumer
of water is required to install.
1 .6.5
The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 198
To counter the problems associated with air pollution, ambient air quality standards
were established, under the 1981, Act. The Act provides means for the control and
abatement of air pollution. The Act seeks to combat air pollution by prohibiting the use
of polluting fuels and substances, as well as by regulating appliances that give rise to
air pollution. Under the Act, establishing or operation of any industrial plant
in the
pollution control area requires consent from State Boards. The Boards are also
expected to test the air in air pollution control areas, inspect pollution control equipment,
and manufacturing processes.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for major pollutants were notified by
the CPCB in April, 1994 and amended
in November, 2009. To empower the Central
and State Pollution Boards to meet grave emergencies, the Air (Prevention and Control
of Pollution) Amendment Act,
1 987, was enacted.
1.6.6
The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1982
These rules defined the procedures for conducting meetings of the Boards, the powers
of the presiding officers, decision-making, the quorum; manner in which the records of
the meeting were to be set, etc. They also prescribed the manner and the purpose of
seeking assistance from specialists and the fee to be paid to them.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
IRC:SP:93-2011
The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came
in to force with effect from October 25,
1980. Under the provisions of this Act, prior approval of the Central Government is
essential for diversion of forest lands for the non-forestry purposes.
In the national
interest and
in the interest of future generations, this Act, therefore, regulates the
diversion of forest lands to non-forestry purposes. The basic objective of the Act
is,
to regulate the indiscriminate diversion of forest lands for non-forestry uses and to
maintain a logical balance between the developmental needs of the country and the
conservation of natural resources/heritage.
1.6.8
The National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995
The Act provides strict liability for damages arising out of any accident occurring while
handling any hazardous substance and for the establishment of a National Environment
Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases arising from such accident,
with a view to give relief and compensation for damages to persons, property and the
environment and for the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
1.6.9
The Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991
The purpose of this act is to provide for public insurance liability for the purpose or
providing immediate relief to the persons affected by accident occurring while handling
any hazardous substances. The Environment Assessment (EA) confirms that
appropriate insurance policy
will be taken
out. EA identifies hazardous materials
associated with the project. The EA document identifies the major accident hazards.
Document describes steps to prevent accident hazards and to limit their consequences
to the environment. The EA indicates commitment to provide information, training and
equipment to ensure worker's safety. EA describes mechanisms to notify the concerned
authority in the event a major accident occurs.
1.6.10
The Forest Conservation Rules, 2003
These are rules by the Central Government for working and conduct of business outlined
under the Forest (Conservation) Act,
1 980.
As per the Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003 proposal involving diversion of forest
land upto five hectares other than the proposal relating to mining and encroachments
are decided by the Regional Offices of the MOEF.
The Regional Office of MOEF is competent to process, scrutinize and forward decision
on proposal involving diversion of more than 5 ha to 40 ha of forest land along with the
recommendation
(if any), to MOEF, New Delhi.

IRC:SP:93-2011
For proposal involving diversion of more than 40 ha forest land the state Government/
Union Territory would forward the proposal with recommendation to MOEF as per para
2.5(ii) of guidelines issued under Forest (Conservation) Act.
1.6.11
The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and amended 2003
This Act empowers the Central and State Governments to establish National Parks
and Sanctuaries; to formulate rules and designate authorities for the maintenance of
National Parks, Sanctuaries and Zoos; to protect and conserve the flora and fauna.
The Circular No 11-9/98-FC dated 4-12-98 issued by the Asst. Inspector General of
Forests states that the Ministry of Environment and Forests has taken a decision not
to permit development activities inside National Park/Sanctuaries and Tiger reserves
areas that are not in consonance of section 29 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1 972.
1.6.12
The Biodiversity Act, 2002
The Biological Diversity Act, which came into force in February 2003, aims to promote
conservation, sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits of India's biodiversity
resources.
It provides for establishment of a National Biodiversity Authority at national
level,
State
Biodiversity Boards
at State
level and
Biodiversity Management
Committees at the level of Panchayats and Municipalities.
This Act prevents persons undertaking biodiversity related activities without approval
from the National Biodiversity Authority.
It extends to the whole of India, and approval
is required from the National Biodiversity Authority. There are particular restrictions
if
the Project involves the participation of non-Indian persons. The EA assesses
if any
biological resource
is required for the Project (plants, animals and micro organisms
or parts thereof). EA assesses
if bio-survey or bio-utilisation is needed for the Project
(surveyor collection of species, etc. for any purpose). EA document outlines measure,
to avoid or minimize effects on biodiversity.
The National Biodiversity Authority shall play a regulatory role with regard to access to
biological resources by foreign citizens and grant of intellectual property rights.
It shall
play an advisory role
in matters relating to the conservation, sustainable use and
equitable distribution of biological resources.
1.6.13

======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
1.6.14
The Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary
Movement) Rules, 2009
The rule requires facilities to classify wastes into different categories and manage
them as per the prescribed guidelines and obtain prior authorisation for handling,
treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Used (Waste) oil from engines
and bituminous wastes from hot mix plants are considered as hazardous waste and
require hazardous waste authorization from State Pollution Control Board.
1.6.15
The Noise (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000
As a result of considering the deleterious and psychological effects of the noise pollution
on the human well-being, MOEF has drawn up the above rules, which have come to
force with effect from February 1 4, 2000. According to the provisions of the rules notified,
a person might make a compla,
it to the designated 'Authority' in the event that the actual
noise levels exceed the ambient noise standards by 10dB(A) or more as compared to
the prescribed standards. The designated authority will take action against the violator
in accordance with the provisions of these rules or other law in force.
The Environment Assessment (EA) identifies all 'industrial', 'commercial', 'residential'
and
'silent' zones within the project study area. EA assesses
if the levels of noise
generated by the project in any area exceeded the ambient air quality standards in
respect of noise as specified in the Schedule of the Rules. The EA describes noise
pollution control measures to achieve compliance with the ambient noise level.
1.6.16
The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification,
1991
Any construction activity within 500 m from high tide line or for crossing back water/
creak has been regulated by Coastal Regulation Zone Notification
1 991 under section
3(1 ) and section 3(2)(v) of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1 986 and Rule 5(3)(d) of
the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 declaring coastal stretches as Coastal
Regulation Zone (CRZ) and regulating activities in the CRZ.
If a highway project passes
within 500 m from high tide line or crosses back water/creak, etc., prior CRZ clearance
is required from Coastal Regulation Zone Authorities and MOEF.

1.6.19
Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) have been identified and notified by the Indian
Ministry of Environment & Forests (MOEF) since 1989. Notifications declaring areas
as ESAs are issued under the Environment (Protection) Act
1 986. The clauses of the
EPA which allow for the notification of ESAs hold the possibility of realising landscape-
level conservation. In response to a Writ Petition (No. 460) (Goa Foundation v/s Union
of India) filed in 2004, the Supreme Court in its order dated December 4, 2006 gave
specific directions on declaration of an area of 10 km around Protected Areas as
ESAs. The order clearly stated the need to
notify the areas within 10 km

PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING FOREST CLEARANCE
3.1
Forest Clearance
When highway project involves use of forest land, clearance for diversion of forest
land
is necessary from State Government and then from Ministry of Environment &
Forests (MOEF) under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.
In J&K State, diversion of
forest land is done under Jammu & Kashmir Forest (Conservation
) Act,
1 992.
As per the Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003 proposal involving diversion of forest
land upto five hectares other than the proposal relating to mining and encroachments
are decided by the Regional Office of the MOEF.
The regional offices of MOEF are also empowered to process, scrutinize and forward
diversion proposal of more than five hectares and upto forty hectares, along with the
recommendations,
if any, to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Paryavaran
Bhawan,
Lodi Road, New
Delhi. For proposals involving diversion
of more than
40 hectares of forest land, the State Government/Union Territory administration would
forward the proposal with recommendations to MOEF.
State Department of Forests
The State Departments of Forests forwards the proposal with recommendations
regarding diversion of forest land in its jurisdiction to the MOEF for in-principle approval
and final clearance.
Procedure for diversion of forest land:
>
Application (Annex IV) submitted to the State Govt.
>
State Govt, recommends the case to the MOEF
>
Upto 5 ha clearance issued by MOEF Regional Office.
>
5-40 ha, processed by R.O. but issued by MOEF Delhi
>
40 ha processed and approved by MOEF Delhi based on the recommendation
of FAG
Two Stage Process
Road projects are considered
in entirety. This means that a road stretch for which
DPR
is prepared, shall be considered as one project, whether
it is passing through

3.2
Obtaining Forest Clearance Under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
3.2=1
Two-Stage Process
The stature for forest diversion requires the diversion to be done
in two stages. At
State-! (that
is, the 'in-principle approval' stage, the proposal
is either agreed to or
rejected after being thoroughly examined by the regional offices (upto to 5 ha),
State
Advisory Group (SAG) (5 to 40 ha), and Forest Advisory Committee (more than 40
ha).
If agreed to, certain conditions, largely relating to payment of appropriate opportunity
costs and expenses towards mitigating the environmental damages of diversion of
forest land are stipulated, which are required to be fulfilled by the project authorities.
Prominent conditions among these include:
>
Net Present Value (NPV) or the quantification of the environmental services
provided for the forest area diverted to non-forestry uses as determined by
the Central Government from time to time by appointing an expert committee;
>
Identification
of non-forest land
for Compensatory Afforestation (CA) and
payment of cost towards CA, or afforestation done in lieu of the diversion of
forest land for non-forestry use under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980;
36



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 120
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
>
Cost
of Penal Compensatory Afforestation
or afforestation work
to be
undertaken over and above the prescribed compensatory afforestation under
the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
in
lieu of the extent of area over which
non-forestry activities have been carried out without obtaining prior approval
of the competent authority under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; and
>
Other expenses towards mitigating the environmental damages including
catchment area treatment,
wildlife preservation,
biodiversity conservation,
and rehabilitation of displaced persons,
if any.
After receipt of Compliance Report, fulfilling the conditions stipulated
in Stage-!
(in-
principle approval) from the user agencies through the respective State/UT
Governments, Stage-!! clearance is accorded by the Government of India. Following
this, the project authorities are handed over the forest land for non-forestry use, provided
they also have other requisite clearances.
3.3
Seeking Forest Clearance Under Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003
Every user agency, that wants to use any forest land for non-forest purposes, is required
to make its proposal in the appropriate form, that is. Form 'A' to the concerned Noda!
Officer along with requisite information and documents, complete in all respects, well
in advance of taking up any non-forest activity on the forest land.
Every State Government or other authority, after having received the proposal and
after being satisfied that the proposal requires prior approval under section 2 of the
Forest (Conservation) Act, shall send the proposal to the Central Government in the
appropriate forms, within 90 days of the receipt of the proposal from the user agency
for proposals seeking first time approval under the Act.
The proposal referred to in sub-rule (2) of Forest (Conservation) Act, involving forest
land upto 40 hectare shall be sent to the Chief Conservator of Forests or Conservator
of Forests of the concerned Regional Office of the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
The proposal referred to sub-rule (2) of Forest (Conservation) Act, involving clearing
of naturally grown trees in forest land or portion thereof for the purpose of using
it for
reafforestation shall be sent to the Chief Conservator of Forests or Conservator of
Forests of the concerned Regional Office of the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
Other Provisions:
The Supreme Court of India, vide its various orders as given below directed the Central
Government to follow certain procedures for according forest clearance:
1)
Vide
its Order dated
13'^ November, 2002
in WP (Civil) No. 337 of 1995, the
Supreme Court of India banned de-reservation of forests/sanctuaries/national
Parks except with the approval of the Supreme Court.
37



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 120
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
2)
The MOEF moved the Supreme Court of India for deletion of the word 'forests'
from the above order, dated
13*^ November, 2000
in WP
(Civil) No. 337 of
1995 through an Interlocutory Application (lA) No. 16. However, the Supreme
Court of India on
9^^ February, 2004 disallowed the request of the Ministry
stating that 'We see no ground to allow the application and delete the word
"forests" from the order dated
13"" November, 2000. The application
is
accordingly dismissed'.
3)
The Supreme Court of India vide
its orders dated 23'^^ November, 2001
in lA
No. 703
in WP
(Civil) No. 202
of 1995,
restrained the Union
of India from
permitting
regularisation
of any encroachments whatsoever without their
approval.
In addition to the above, a general approval has been given to the State Governments
for according approval upto
1 .00 ha of forest land for non-forest purposes for social
sector developmental projects executed by Government agencies. These are also
covered under the Scheduled Tribe and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition
of Forest Rights) Act, 2006;
Measures to Reduce the Adverse Impact of the Loss of Forest Land:
Compensatory afforestation (CA)
is one of the most important conditions stipulated
by the Central Government while approving proposals for de-reservation or diversion
of forest land for non-forest uses to mitigate the adverse impact of the loss of forest
land:
1)
The CA shall be done over an equivalent area of non-forest land, identified
contiguous to or in the proximity of the Reserved Forest or Protected Forest
to enable the Forest Department to effectively manage the newly planted
area.
2)
Equivalent non-forest land
identified
for the purpose
for CA are
to be
transferred to the ownership of the State Forest Department and declared as
protected forests.
3)
As a special
provision
for Central Government/Central Government
undertaking projects, CA may be raised on degraded forest land spread over
twice the forest area being diverted.

Wildlife Clearance from Supreme Court in Notified Wildlife Areas
When a road project passes through a protected area (PA), like a National Park, Wildlife
Sanctuary or biosphere reserve, prior clearance is necessary from National Board of
Wildlife and then from Honorable Supreme Court. Wildlife clearance is a prerequisite
for forest clearance for diversion of forest land located in protected area.
It is important
to mention that even surveys and geotechnical studies in Protected Areas (PA) require
prior clearance from the National Board of Wildlife. The form for wildlife clearance
consists 5 parts (Annex V).

at uniform intervals.
**
24 hourly or 08 hourly or 01 hourly monitored values, as applicable, shall be complied with 98
percent of the time in a year. 2 percent of the time, they may exceed the limits but not on two
consecutive days of monitoring.
Note: Whenever and wherever monitoring results on two consecutive days of monitoring exceeds the
limit specified above for respective category,
it shall be considered reason to institute regular
and continous monitoring and further enventigation (Source: National Ambient Air Quality Standard,
CPCB).
7.3
Noise Limits and Guidelines for Diesel Generators
Noise from DG set shall be controlled by providing an acoustic enclosure or by treating
the room acoustically, at the user end.
The acoustic enclosure or acoustic treatment of the room shall be designed for minimum
25 dB(A) insertion loss or for meeting the ambient noise standards, whichever is on
the higher side
(if the actual ambient noise is on the higher side,
it may not be possible
to check the performance of the acoustic enclosure/acoustic treatment). Under such
53



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 120
======================================================================
IRC:SP:93-2011
circumstances the performance may be checked
for noise reduction upto actual
ambient noise level, preferably, in the night time. The measurement for insertion loss
may be done at different points at 0.5 m from the acoustic enclosure/room, and then
averaged;
These limits shall be regulated by the state pollution control boards:
•
The manufacturer shall
offer to the user a standard acoustic enclosure of
25 dB(A)
insertion
loss and also a suitable exhaust muffler with
insertion
loss of 25 dB(A).
•
The user shall make efforts to bring down the noise level due to the DG set,
outside his premises, within the ambient noise requirements by proper sitting
and control measures
Installation of a DG set must be strictly in compliance with the recommendations of the
DG set manufacturer and a proper routine and preventive maintenance procedure for
the DG set should be set and followed in consultation with the DG set manufacturer.
Emissions from DG Sets
As per the CPCP standards, emissions are governed by providing stack height. The
minimum stack height for DG set is worked out using the formula
: H = h + 0.2 Vkva
,
where H
is the height of the stack in meters, h
is the height in metres, of the building
where DG set is installed and KVA is the generation capacity of DG set.
