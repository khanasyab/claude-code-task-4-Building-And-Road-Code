Capacity Building of Road Agencies in charge of  
Implementation of Road Projects in Urban Areas
1 Introduction
1.1	
The task for preparation of document “Capacity Building of Road Agencies in 
charge of Implementation of Road Projects in Urban Areas” was taken up by the Urban Roads, 
Streets & Transport Committee (H-8). The draft was deliberated in a series of meetings.  The 
H-8 Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 14th October, 2016 
and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the HSS Committee.

Secretary General, 
Indian Roads Congress
Nirmal, Sanjay Kumar
The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved the 
draft document in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 13th July, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing it before 
the Council. The Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur on 14th and 15th July, 2017 
considered and approved the draft IRC:SP:111-2017 “Capacity Building of Road Agencies in 
charge of Implementation of Road Projects in Urban Areas” for printing.
The responsibility for urban roads and streets rests with the State governments and the Urban 
Local Bodies. In some cities, the development authorities and public works department are 
also required to undertake implementation of road projects. This calls for concerted efforts at 
strengthening capabilities at the State and city level to efficiently implement the tasks involved 
in provision of sustainable urban transportation  services and infrastructure including roads. 
Capacity building would have to be addressed at two levels – institutional and individual.
1.2	
The Working Group on Urban Transport set up under the chairmanship of 
Secretary (Urban Development), Ministry of Urban Development by the National Transport 
Development Policy Committee had projected an investment of Rs. 9,17,000 crore to 
Rs.12,08,000 crore during the period, 2012-32. This would imply an investment of around 
Rs. 50,000 crore to Rs. 60,000 crore per year on roads in urban areas. Currently, NITI Aayog 
is formulating a Vision 2030 for various sectors of the economy. This will then be backed 
up with 7-year Strategy and 3-year Plan of Action. As such the amount of funds for urban 
roads may vary from year to year. In any case, investments for roads in urban areas shall 
remain quite high. With recent initiatives of the Government in creation of Smart Cities and 
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) project, it is necessary 
to ensure value for money from the investments in urban roads.  This will require due 
diligence in planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance management of road 
infrastructure by the urban local bodies and other road departments entrusted with the road 
network in urban areas. This will necessitate improvement of skills, knowledge and capacity 
of decision makers, engineering personnel, staff members of consultancy organisations 
and managers and workers of contractors, etc. Even the city councillors are expected to 
have some understanding of issues involved in planning and design of road space and 
infrastructure from the angle of mobility and accessibility planning for cities with emphasis on 
safe and comfortable movement of people and goods on the road network including those 
who use the road space and provide services, safety and shelter to road users. The city 
corporation/council will have a key role to play in ensuring provision and management of road 
infrastructure in urban areas and human aspects of road design as an inclusive, safe and 
equitable public good. 
1.3	
The mode of delivery of projects in road infrastructure is also witnessing 
transformation. Besides item rate construction contracts, the central government has 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
5
introduced EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) contracts where the scope of 
work is stipulated by the government but the contractor is required to design and build. The 
sector has also seen good progress in PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode of delivery 
by the private entrepreneur on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis. These 
PPP projects may be implemented either through BOT (Toll) where the private entrepreneur 
collects the toll during operation period or BOT (Annuity or Hybrid Annuity) where the 
entrepreneur receives regular six monthly or annual amount from the government to recover 
his investments, interest thereon and the profits. For maintenance, Performance Based 
Maintenance Contracts are being practiced in several states. These are normally 5-year 
contract and standards of performance are laid down by the government. The contractor is 
paid based on his performance.
1.4	
Funds for urban road infrastructure would also need to be tapped from private 
sector sources by way of equity from entrepreneurs and debt from banks and other financing 
institutions. This throws up demand for not only skills and competence in technical designs, 
social and environment safeguards, procurement processes, project management and 
maintenance, contract administration but also for financial and legal skills to ensure fair 
allocation of risks and rewards in implementation of PPP projects. Equally important is to 
ensure community participation and consensus-building with participation from all classes of 
future road users, and not just the motorists.
2 MoHUA Guidelines
2.1	
Annual Capacity Building Plan 
Presently, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is supporting States and ULBs 
in capacity building activities through two schemes - Comprehensive Capacity Building 
Program (CCBP) and the Capacity Building for Urban Development Project (CBUD). Keeping 
in view the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT, the Strategy and Plan of Action (PoA) for 
capacity building of ULBs are given below. 
2.2	
Strategy 
Several reports and studies have recommended capacity building of both municipal 
functionaries and municipal institutions. Accordingly, the Capacity Building Plan consists of 
two strategic interventions - Individual Capacity Building and Institutional Capacity Building. 
The purpose of individual training is to enhance the functional knowledge, improve the job 
related skills and change the attitude of municipal functionaries. The one-year training will be 
imparted to municipal functionaries in training institutes (classroom) followed by its application 
at their work place. Additionally, they will be mentored and provided coaching services at 
their work place during the one year training period. The aim of Institutional Capacity Building 
is to improve institutional outcomes, as set out in the AMRUT Reform Agenda. 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
6
2.3	
Plan of Action (PoA) 
2.3.1	
Individual Capacity Building
Based on the Training Needs Assessment (TNA), the focus will be on the following four 
departments in ULBs:
	
(i)	
Finance and Revenue: Financial Planning and Management, Revenue 
Mobilization. 
	
(ii)	
Engineering and Public Health: Water and Sanitation, Drainage and Solid 
Waste Management. 
	
(iii)	 Town Planning: Urban Planning including pro-poor planning approaches. 
	
(iv)	 Administration: e-Governance, Computer and Soft Skills. 
The ULBs will plan to train at least 30 functionaries from the four departments every year and 
all elected representatives. The elected representatives will be imparted training once at the 
training institutes, which will include a site-visit to learn from best practices in India. 
The training will consist of three capsules spread over a year. Each capsule will consist of 
three days training in the training institute followed by four months during which the training 
will be applied in their work by the municipal functionaries. 
During a period of one year, therefore, a municipal functionary will be imparted training for 
nine (9) days in the training institute. There are several retired officers from the Central, 
State and Municipal services who are settled in the ULBs. During the four months when the 
trainees return to their work place, such retired officers can work as mentors. For this, the 
training agencies will match mentors with the municipal functionaries. 
Finally, the year-long training will also contain one visit to an initiative in India identified as a 
best practice and one participation in an International/National workshop. 
The training will be conducted by empanelled training agencies, academic institutes and 
other not-for-profit organizations (henceforth called entities). They will be allocated ULBs 
located within States/regions/areas. Payments to entities will be made after completion of 
each capsule by the ULBs, subject to training having met its objectives as independently 
assessed by the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) or its nominee. If gaps are identified 
by the NIUA, the training entity will have to conduct the re-training at its cost. The NIUA will 
be the strategic partner of the MoHUA in capacity building and will provide single window 
services to the MoHUA/States/ULBs. 
The NIUA will be involved in disseminating information on training modules, documenting 
best practices, monitoring the progress of training, and, most important, evaluating the 
benefits of training after completion of each training capsule of four months. This evaluation 
will be done for all the individual municipal functionaries over the one-year long training 
period and results will be shared with the training entities to make them review their training 
methods and modules, if necessary, to make the training more appropriate and relevant 
for the municipal functionaries. For example, functionaries will self-assess the training in 
the standard formats prescribed after completion of the three-day training program by the 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
7
training entities in the classroom. Again on their return from the work place after four months, 
the functionaries will undertake self-assessment. In addition, their supervisors will also make 
an assessment about the improvement in skills, knowledge and attitudes of the trainees. 
The self-assessment and supervisor assessment will inform the NIUA and the training entity 
about (i) impact of the training on the skills, knowledge and attitude of individual functionaries 
over their existing levels (baseline), and (ii) improvements in tasks-related performance. 
Importantly, the learnings gained from such a real-time evaluation will be used by the NIUA 
to disseminate lessons learnt and to design future activities for ULBs/States. 
The NIUA will examine and approve, in consultation with National Mission Director, the roll-
out of other components of the CCBP (e.g. workshops, seminars, visits, etc). The NIUA will 
also prepare an  Annual Capacity Building Report in order to make mid-course correction in 
the Capacity Building Plan. For this purpose, adequate technical and human resources will 
be provided to NIUA from the Mission funds. The funding for the individual capacity building 
will be from the State A&OE/CBUD Funds. 
2.3.2	
Institutional Capacity Building
The aim is to improve institutional outcomes e.g. accountability and transparency, service 
delivery, citizen empowerment, resource mobilization by bringing in external experts and 
professionals. The external resources can be brought in two ways: (i) outsourcing of functions, 
and (ii) outsourcing of functionaries. In outsourcing of functionaries, human resource 
agencies supply human resources, while in outsourcing of functions an activity/job is given to 
an external company, organization or institution. In both these options, payments are linked 
to achievement of objectives and outcomes. The following functions will be outsourced and 
funded through the A&OE Funds/CCBP/CBUD as decided by the National Mission Director. 
	
(i)	
Empanelling of handholding agencies and/or consulting firms for preparation 
of Smart City Proposal for the Smart Cities selection competition. 
	
(ii)	
Empanelling of handholding agencies and/or consulting firms for complete 
end-to-end assistance in AMRUT for the preparation of State Level 
Implementation Plan (SLIP), Project Development (e.g. design, estimation) 
and Management. 
	
(iii)	 Assisting in implementing the reform agenda focusing on outcomes, as given 
in AMRUT Reforms and identified indicators in the CCBP toolkit15. 
	
(iv)	 Providing human resources and all other kinds of support to the Special 
Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to be established under the Smart City Mission by 
providing professionals and managers. 
	
(v)	
Mobilize external resources and improve internal resource generation of 
the ULBs. For instance, facilitate access to municipal bonds by credit rating 
ULBs, providing assistance to ULBs to monetize land and prepare Tax 
Increment Financing (TIF) proposals, obtain private funding, etc. 
	
(vi)	 Develop multi-layer GIS maps connected to data (attribute tables) in order to 
enable ULBs to use GIS for decision-making. 



======================================================================

(vii)	 Assist the States/ULBs to revise Laws and Rules (e.g. land pooling) for 
implementing the AMRUT Reform Agenda. 
	
(viii)	 This is not an exhaustive list and new items will be added as the Missions 
are implemented. 
There are several structures existing at the State and ULB levels, such as Project Management 
Units (PMUs), Project Implementation Units (PIUs), Reform and Performance Management 
Cells (RPMCs), etc. At present, only the RPMC will be supported by the Mission. They will 
perform the functions given in the CCBP toolkit, but focus on, (a) assisting the Mission 
Director in preparing the State Annual Action Plan (SAAP), Reform implementation so that 
at least 70% Reforms are achieved in order to qualify for the Reform incentive, and (b) visit 
all the Mission cities to assist them in implementation of reforms prescribed in the AMRUT. 
The Urban Management Cells (UMCs) will  also be supported by the Mission and they 
will report to the State Mission Director. In addition to their tasks given in the CCBP toolkit 
they will focus on, (i) coordinating and building cooperation between the ITIs, empanelled 
training agencies and ULBs for individual training programmes, (ii) carrying out training of 
trainers, (iii) providing task oriented coaching for the full year to the municipal functionaries 
in collaboration with empanelled agencies, and (iv) fostering partnership and networking 
between empanelled training institutions and ITIs. The States/ULBs will submit a Capacity 
Development Plan in prescribed forms along with the SAAP for approval by the MoHUA.
3 Addressing knowledge gap in road sector
3.1	
The road departments and public transport providers need to look at good 
practices from within India and other developing/developed countries where roads have 
been developed as inclusive spaces serving needs of all road user groups particularly 
pedestrians and cyclists, apart from motorists. Subsequently, standards that comply with 
such realities need to be evolved. This can be done using visioning exercises, sample focus 
group discussions and community based interviews, and thereby building capacity of both 
civic agencies and communities in the process.
3.2	
The Skills, Knowledge and Attitude (SKA) of various functionaries in the urban 
local bodies and road departments responsible for urban roads have to be enhanced by 
way of improving their overall technical knowledge (road engineering, safe and inclusive 
designing, traffic engineering and transport planning for all road user groups including public 
transport users, non-motorized transport users and para-transit users) and managerial 
ability for efficient delivery of road infrastructure projects and subsequent operations and 
maintenance management. In urban areas, they have also to regularly interact with other 
departments such as traffic police, utilities, transport corporations, metro rail authorities. It is 
essential that these functionaries:
	
•	
are acquainted with fundamentals of inclusive transport planning and traffic 
engineering.
	
•	
are acquainted with best national/international practices in implementation of 
road and bridge works.

implementation, construction, operation and monitoring of transport 
infrastructure.
	
•	
keep up the momentum towards enhanced governance (accountability, 
efficiency and transparency) and redressal of grievances raised by contractors 
and the community.
	
•	
can manage post-implementation audits for universal accessibility and 
continued safety requirements both by third party and trained in-house 
auditors to pro-actively conduct audits.
3.3	
Side by side of skill development of road departments, attention is equally to be 
focused on skill development of consultants and contractors and their project managers, 
construction workers and equipment operators.
3.4	
The technicians, foremen and supervisors form the backbone of the road 
construction sector for implementation on the ground. However, unorganised nature of the 
industry have inhibited the institutionalisation of the role of these supervisory cadre staff, and 
affected the productivity of construction workers and equipment operators. This weak link 
will require special attention for successful execution of works designed by the engineering 
professionals.
4 Special Areas of Focus
The topics for the capacity building module for road development need to include the following 
special areas:
	
•	
Urban space planning: Visioning and planning for road space, two-way 
communication between transport and planning authorities. Evaluate Master 
Plan for the city in the context of the requirements at the Regional and Sub-
regional levels for which they have the responsibility. Consideration for 
road width, junctions, parking, open spaces, plantation, over/underground 
services, pedestrianised areas, on-street vending, loading/unloading, bus/
metro stations.
	
•	
Facility planning: The specific requirements of access (e.g. to parking, bus/
metro stations, shops, pedestrian facilities) and circulation of vehicular and 
pedestrian traffic (e.g. entry/exit, safe passage and cross over). Creating 
safe and inclusive designs for safeguarding pedestrians and cyclists and 
other vulnerable user groups.

10
	
•	
Conducting road safety and accessibility audits and scientific crash 
investigations
	
•	
Setting up institutional mechanisms to ensure integrated planning and 
coordination with other infrastructure and service providers like water, 
sewage, electricity, traffic police and telecom departments.
	
•	
Re-thinking on road space allocation and use by creating dedicated 
infrastructure for public transport, non-motorized transport and para transit.
	
•	
Traffic Management: Layout and spacing of junctions based on geometry and 
regulated movements (e.g. to provide for adequate length for merge, weave 
and diverge), geometric design of junctions (e.g. from the considerations of 
lane balance and lane drop), restricting certain movements (e.g. one-way, 
no right turn, no free left turn), signal plans (e.g. dynamic demand-based 
signal stages, cycle time, green time allocation) and linking of signals (e.g. 
ensuring ‘green wave’ at certain speed of travel across the linked signals), 
vehicle actuated signals (e.g. by providing buried loop detectors to sense 
the presence and demand for green time), signing and marking plans and 
integrating the pedestrian facilities with road facilities. 
	
•	
Intelligent Transportation System: CCTV monitoring of real time traffic, 
providing real time feed to the enforcing agencies for traffic management 
and control interventions, enabling control room interventions for making 
dynamic changes in signal plans to manage congestion in certain specified 
area.
	
•	
Community engagement: Awareness raising with local residents and 
community consultation for development of plans for the streets.
These could be further refined and customized to meet the needs and relevance of the 
agencies/individuals being trained. 
5 Core Competence 
5.1	
Except for some states, there is lack of core competence in road departments. 
Road Departments in the states should have a strong Design Directorate with minimum of 
five wings with capacity for in-house design and monitoring of outputs of the task outsourced 
to private consultants and individual experts:
	
(a)	
Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning
	
(b)	
Pavement and Safety Engineering Design
	
(c)	
Bridge Structures Design
	
(d)	
Social and Environment Safeguards
	
(e)	
Accessibility and Mobility Standards
5.2	
The Design Directorate should have at least 4 to 5 professionals at various levels 
with specialized qualifications in each discipline. Those who do not possess minimum of 
M. Tech qualifications should be provided with long-term courses in relevant discipline 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
11
with support of national/international academic institutions. These engineers should 
be considered as recognized professionals in their niche area. Proper infrastructure – 
hardwares, software, office equipments, etc. and office space would, of course, need to 
be planned and provided. 
5.3	
Apart from undertaking in-house design, the various specialists of the Design 
Directorate should also be utilised for proof checking and overseeing the work of design 
consultants. Needless to add that currently, this is an area of some concern and is a contributory 
factor in change of work scope during execution and avoidable disputes and even genuine 
claims raised by the contractors. Designs have to be optimal to suit the condition of soil 
and anticipated traffic so that both over design and under design are avoided and value 
for money invested is achieved. There is also need to improve the system of topographic, 
soil, material, geotechnical and hydraulic surveys and investigations besides scientific traffic 
surveys, designs and preparation of bid documents.
5.4	
For road projects proposed to be undertaken through private financing on 
Public-Private Partnership approaches, it would be expedient to engage a financial expert 
agency to support the department in financial appraisal of the project and assessing the 
likely attractiveness of the project by the prospective concessionaires including viability gap 
funding requirements. 
6 Involving Key Stakeholders
There needs to be a strong emphasis on the continuous involvement of all relevant stakeholder-
groups (all persons including those with reduced mobility and disabilities, city-consultants, 
local/ regional authorities, etc.) from the very start of the project. Towards this goal, a two-
pronged approach is required. 
	
(a)	
Establish a system of effective stakeholder involvement and 
communication: Create platforms for educating, sharing ideas and 
information and learning from each-other’s experiences with the stakeholders, 
in all the phases of creating and maintaining inclusive transport systems. The 
stakeholders will include users, planners, architects, engineers, contractors, 
civic agencies, and Government departments that construct and maintain 
public facilities and outdoor environment. Raise awareness among the local 
and regional decision-makers of the link between accessibility and energy-
efficiency in transport, by initiating communication among all relevant local 
and regional stakeholders to improve accessibility. 
	
(b)	
Establish a structure of systematic and effective approach for 
comprehensive design including universal accessibility in planning, 
implementation, and evaluation: Piecemeal implementation will not be 
effective until the intermediate links are established. For example, the efficacy 
of an accessible BRT or Metro system will be incomplete, if people cannot 
access the footpaths, roads and intermediate pedestrian infrastructure to 
reach these facilities. A seamless trip chain is necessary to close the loop.

7 Skill Development and Training Strategy
7.1	
Target Groups
The target groups for training and skill development should be municipal bodies and road 
departments responsible for urban roads, consultants normally engaged for DPRs for roads, 
bridges, flyovers and for supervision of works.
7.2	
Training Strategy
The training strategy should cover the following aspects:
	
(i)	
All road departments: Urban Local Bodies and road departments for urban 
roads within their jurisdiction and communities.
	
(ii)	
Institutional framework: Strengthening and networking of existing training 
and academic institutions, collaboration with international agencies.
	
(iii)	 Project cycle: Traffic and Transportation Studies, Planning, Design, DPR 
preparation, Procurement, Construction, Operation and Maintenance, 
Evaluation.
	
(iv)	 Type of training: Induction training at entry, training for in-service engineers, 
refresher courses, short-term and long-term specialized courses on a range 
of subjects like road design, inclusive planning, stakeholder management, 
standards and codes, best practices, etc.. Also, crash training on innovations 
– like new technologies and international practices where these are required 
to be introduced to provide value for money and achieve efficiency in use of 
resources. 
	
(v)	
Level of officers: At all levels (junior, middle, senior and top management 
cadre). Special attention for supervisory cadre. Training modules to be 
specially designed for each level.
	
(vi)	 Different 
aspects: 
Transportation 
studies, 
traffic 
assessment, 
access standards, project preparation, alignment selection, scope of 
work, cost-benefit and financial appraisal (particularly for toll-based 
projects),procurement procedures, construction management, specifications 
and quality assurance, legal, land management, contract administration, 
dispute resolution, negotiation skills, social and environment aspects, GIS, 
GPS, IT-enabled services, ITS technologies, safety, financial management, 
asset management, personality development, communication skills, team 
work. In general identifying the gaps in SKA of the target audience and 
designing the training curriculum in context to their needs.
	
(vii)	 System of incentives: For department officers, promotion could be linked 
to participation in skill development and training programmes. Minimum 
participation in predefined training modules should be crossed before 
promotion to AE, EE and SE levels.
	
(viii)	 User Interface and Sensitization: Many commuters face both attitudinal 



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
13
and physical problems while using public transport. It should be mandatory 
to provide regular and refresher trainings to all staff that come in direct 
touch with the people. This should include training in topics like courtesy, 
cleanliness, gender sensitivity, trauma response and safety.
	
(ix)	 Enforcement: Non-compliance and/or faulty implementation create hazards 
and must be prevented. Currently, it is not mandatory for all state departments 
to enforce standards. Tender and contract documents must include specific 
instructions and training modules to ensure that codes of practice including 
universal accessibility are followed as per design. 
8 Accessibility Audits
8.1	
Accessibility audits are an important means of ensuring codes of practice on 
access for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. They must cover all stage of the 
process of planning, design, construction, maintenance, monitoring and evaluation. Audits 
provide valuable guidance from the perspective of identifying deficiencies in road/street and 
pedestrian infrastructure and developing strategies to overcome them in the most effective 
and practical way. 
8.2	
Transport networks keep changing and evolving based on user requirements, 
climatic conditions and infrastructure depreciation in real time. Regular monitoring of all 
systems and services within this framework is imperative to maximize its efficacy. Any 
shortfall in implementation and maintenance and/or lack of understanding on the part of 
implementing agencies, civic bodies, user groups and other service providers will compromise 
the accessibility of this network. There has to be a commitment to invest time, funds and 
technology in capacity building, maintenance, monitoring and operational activities.
8.3	
A strategic planning effort involving all relevant stakeholders (persons with reduced 
mobility, persons with disabilities, government departments, consultants including planners, 
architects, engineers, implementing and maintaining agencies including contractors and 
vendors) is needed. It provides local stakeholders with the understanding of the attitudinal, 
social and physical challenges that confront persons with disabilities of different ages and 
gender, and, need for creating seamless travel chains. Conducted by a team of qualified 
access auditors, design professionals (architect, transport planner and urban planner), 
persons with diverse disabilities and senior citizens, it provides information for effective 
implementation of the audit recommendations.
8.4 	
Training of professionals and practitioners will result in:
	
•	
Improving credibility, efficiency, and in undertaking accessibility audits 
effectiveness of the work. 
	
•	
Fulfilling the needs of changing society.
	
•	
Avoiding costly corrections by taking into account the accessibility 
requirements right from the start.

9 Technicians and Supervisors
9.1 	
Skill development of these important functionaries whether working in the domain 
of contractors or the road departments has to be undertaken because they perform the vital 
supervisory and quality control functions. The fundamentals and basics are generally unknown 
to them. It is thus imperative to evolve a meticulous system and approach in which these 
field level functionaries are prepared formally in terms of their understanding the theoretical 
concepts and field operations to strike maximum correlation between the two. 
9.2 	
It is proposed that school pass outs and school drop outs in particular may 
be trained as site supervisors under well-defined short duration modules of 12-16 weeks 
comprising theoretical concepts and field training (latter through collaboration with industry). 
These supervisors may be trained in various fields, such as:
	
(i)	
Embankment, sub-grade, sub-base and unbound base course
	
(ii)	
Bituminous and concrete construction
	
(iii)	 Construction of culverts and bridges
	
(iv)	 Maintenance operations
	
(v)	
Management of traffic during and post construction
	
(vi)	 Inventory data collection
	
(vii)	 Utility relocation activities
	
(viii)	 Horticulture and afforestation
	
(ix)	 Pedestrian accessibility, safety standards and user sensitization
9.3	
The Technicians may be trained under longer modules, say 20-24 weeks. The 
possible areas could be:
	
(i)	
Soil and sub-surface investigation and sampling
	
(ii)	
Topographical surveys
	
(iii)	 Traffic surveys 
	
(iv)	 Quantity calculations and preparing BOQ
	
(v)	
Quality control and laboratory testing
9.4 	
A system of mandatory engagement of these trained supervisors and technicians 
by contractors and consultants is necessary to optimise benefits. Hence, to make the 
classroom environment lively and interactive, some training techniques are to introduce 
group activities to re-inforce session outcomes and learning, use of audio-visual tools like 
videos and charts to engage the trainees, simulation exercise where the trainees are blind 
folded or are required to use a wheelchair to cross road or move on to a footpath, etc. 
9.5	
In many cities, in response to the need to step up pace of execution, supervision, 
design consultants and supervision consultants have been engaged to work for the road 
department. There is clearly a need for updating of knowledge and skill development of the 
key personnel being engaged by the consulting firms for urban roads and especially making 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
15
them to place universal access and inclusivity at the heart of road design. This will help in 
enhancing the quality and reliability of their services. 
10 Skill Development and Training Plan
10.1	
Training Plan
Each urban local body and other road departments should identify one full time training 
coordinator at the headquarters. The training coordinator should be provided with suitable 
support staff and office equipment. He should work under the directions of a top level 
Engineer. He should have a complete list of all officers at various levels together with their 
brief particulars regarding qualifications as also period and area of training received in the 
last three years. This list should be updated on regular basis to identify the officers who have 
not been provided training till date. A long term training plan should be prepared which may 
also include Study Leave for selected individuals to undergo long-term M. Tech. Courses 
in various disciplines of transport planning, traffic engineering and highway engineering. 
Such a training plan should be prepared under the overall leadership and guidance of the 
Administrator of the Urban Local Body.
10.2	
Induction Training
At the entry level, every staff member should be given a comprehensive foundation course 
on various responsibilities and duties expected from him in the organisation. The duration 
of such training may be 10-12 weeks, out of which four weeks should be for mentoring and 
apprentice under a senior Engineer of the department. Such training may include visits to 
prestigious project sites. 
10.3	
In-service Training
Training and skill enhancement has to be a continuous exercise. Therefore, the training plan 
should include periodic training of all in-service staff at various levels so that they are abreast 
of the latest know-how and state-of-art technologies. The requirement for specialization and 
skill development of officers in core processes of traffic studies, planning, design, preparation 
of sound DPR, economic and financial appraisal, social and environment concerns, contract 
management, standards and specifications, quality control, financial management, safety 
and access audit, IT and GIS related services, etc. should receive regular attention. The 
training plan should include study tours of projects in India and abroad by a group of officers. 
11 Funds
Sufficient funds must be budgeted by the urban local bodies for skill development and training 
of staff. The quality of output of the skilled staff and efficient delivery of project would more 
than offset the expenditure incurred towards skill development. It is recommended that the 
urban local bodies and other road departments may earmark a provision of 0.25 per cent 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
16
of the project cost in each estimate towards skill development and training of staff so as to 
cover course fees, travel to training centres, per diem allowance and expenses of training 
institutions in imparting training to the officers. This would help create a pool of talented 
engineers and other staff within the road departments.
12 Training Infrastructure and Institutional Architecture
12.1	
Some states already have training institution or centre for providing training to its 
technical personnel. Other states may also consider setting up a training institute at state 
level. The state level training institutions may be utilised by these urban bodies for training of 
engineers responsible for urban roads. 
12.2	
Develop and utilize the technical training resource reservoirs available in the 
Centres of Excellence created by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Institute of 
Urban Transport, Schools of Planning and Architecture (Department of Transport Planning), 
IITs, NITs and other engineering colleges for supporting the state level training centres. 
12.3	
Among the prime training institutions in the country, mention may be made of the 
Indian Academy of Highway Engineers earlier known as the National Institute for Training 
of Highway Engineers (NITHE), the Central Public Works Department Training Academy 
at Ghaziabad, Institute of Urban Transport (IUT) and the Central Road Research Institute 
(CRRI) at the national level. The IAHE is a collaborative institute of the Central and State 
Governments. A brief activity profile of IAHE is given in Box 1.
Box 1: Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE)
•	
Established in 1983. Campus in NOIDA. Collaborative institute of the Central and State 
Governments.

Initiative of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.
•	
An apex institution of excellence for skill development and training of highway engineers 
in road sector – both at entry level and during service.
•	
Mission: Bring in efficiency and value for money in planning, design, construction and 
maintenance of roads in the country and inculcate leadership quality, professionalism 
and commitment to excellence among the highway engineers.
•

state levels, also conducts programmes in various states.
•	
Also imparts training to highway engineers from SAARC and African countries.
•	
Has an excellent infrastructure: lecture halls, seminar halls, auditorium, hostel, Board 
room, office block, canteen, recreation facilities, library, computer lab, soil testing lab, 
staff quarters (spread over an area of around 10 acres).
12.4	
Apart from national institutions, there is need to identify international training 
agencies. Officers both at senior and junior level should be exposed to best international 
practices by enabling them to visit prestigious projects not only within the country but also 
abroad. The external agencies like the World Bank, ADB and other international forums can 
provide technical assistance support in this effort.



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 34
======================================================================
IRC:SP:111-2017
17
12.5	
Distance education and e-learning are other IT-enabled tools that can be utilized 
in this sector also.
12.6	
The training institutions should be in regular contact with the IUT, IRC, CRRI and 
the academia in indentifying the new engineering technologies and innovations and other 
business processes that need to be introduced for their transfer on the ground. The IRC 
Committee on Urban Roads, Streets and Transport Committee can act as a focal point for 
such interaction.
13 Training Areas, Modules and Course Material
13.1	
There are several areas for training to which the officers need to be exposed. It 
needs to be realized that the area and depth of training will differ for level of staff (supervisors, 
junior level, middle level and senior level engineers). Indicative lists of possible areas for skill 
enhancement of engineers are given in Annex-1. Some outside support should be sought in 
preparing a comprehensive document identifying areas of training for:
	
•	
Staff at senior, middle and junior level
	
•	
Supervisors, Surveyors, Junior Engineers, Lab. Assistants
	
•	
Junior Engineers and Assistant Engineers at Entry Level
13.2	
Such a document should also provide a brief course content for each topic of 
training and indicative duration for various levels of staff. As an illustration, Box 2 provides 
indicative course contents for training of SEs/EEs in construction supervision during project 
implementation. Another document should be prepared covering course material for each 
training module. This should include list of reading references and relevant IRC codes, 
standards, manuals and guidelines for each module.

14 Faculty and Institution
The course contents should be divided into each day schedule for the duration of training for 
each proposed course. The source of training material also needs to be identified for ease of 
reference by both the faculty and the trainees. Training material for each module should be 
a combination of audio-visuals and basic knowledge concepts. The possible faculty and the 
training institution should also be identified. 
15 Documentation and Dissemination 
15.1	
It is recognised that providing functionaries of road departments, contractors, 
consultants and administrators with the guidelines and manuals on important aspects 
relating to inclusive and equitable planning, road safety, techno-economic feasibilities, 
project preparation, procurement, construction, contract administration, access standards 
and sensitization etc. will be quite useful in improving orderly delivery and thereby adding to 
the capacity and capabilities of the stakeholders in the road sector. A list of identified manuals

bi-weekly, or monthly open streets event 
when select streets are closed to private 
vehicles for several hours. Usually held 
on Sundays, streets are opened up for the 
exclusive use of pedestrians, cyclists, and 
other users of Non-Motorised Transport 
(NMT). The “Streets For All” Toolkit 
provides detailed steps for planning, 
operating, implementing and evaluating 
these open streets events. 
15.
Universal Accessibility Guidelines for 
Pedestrian, Non-motorized Vehicle and 
Public Transport Infrastructure
Aim at improving accessibility for everyone 
for those who use the walking, cycling 
environment and public transport system. 
These Guidelines utilize principles of 
universal design to improve access to 
pedestrian and public transport systems 
for all users.
15.2	
Apart from the above documents, there are several codes, manuals, guidelines 
of the Indian Roads Congress on various engineering aspects of urban road infrastructure. 
Arrangements may be made to disseminate all such documents through workshops at regular 
intervals among the staff of the urban local bodies and road departments.
