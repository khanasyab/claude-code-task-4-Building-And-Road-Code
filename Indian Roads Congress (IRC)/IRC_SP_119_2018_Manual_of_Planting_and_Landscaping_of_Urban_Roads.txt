Introduction
The Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree Plantation, First Revision (IRC:SP:21-2009) published 
in November, 2009 provides comprehensive guidance on landscaping and roadside arboriculture 
along highways. As the focus of the current publication appears to be more towards roads of 
higher categories, IRC prepared and published another  document titled Guidelines on Tree 
Plantation along Rural Roads (IRC:SP:103-2014) on request of National Rural Road Agency 
(NRRDA), Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD).
Catering the need of Urban Roads, the task to prepare a separate document on “Manual for 
Planting and Landscaping of Urban Roads” was taken up by the Urban Roads and Streets 
(H-8) Committee. The H-8 Committee in its meeting held on 20.05.2017 entrusted the work of 
preparation of initial draft to the sub-group under the chairmanship of Ms. Paromita Roy comprising 
Ms. Nidhi Madan and Shri Anuj Malhotra. The initial draft was discussed in various meetings and 
valuable inputs were received from members of H-8 Committee. The H-8 Committee approved 
the document in its meeting held on 18.08.2017 for placing before the HSS Committee. 
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

use of water; minimize soil erosion; and provide a comfortable transit environment. This Manual 
provides the requisite landscape standards and guidelines to successfully achieve these goals. 
Landscaping when integrated with geometric design elements of roads as well as provision of 
amenities for all road users, is often termed as Streetscaping. It is a multi-disciplinary subject

A paradigm change is envisaged in the Landscaping of Roads and Streets in sync with other 
related IRC codes, in order to address the above issues, as follows:
Issue 1.
	Air Pollution, Heat Island Effect and their Mitigation
Rapid urbanization and increasing loss of green cover is leading to higher ambient temperatures 
than normal and contributing to dust-re-suspension and accentuated air-pollution issues in urban 
areas. Lack of shading and green cover on roads is making them unfriendly for pedestrians 
and cyclists and leading to an induced modal shift towards private vehicles and unsustainable 
development trend.
To address the above, trees need to be incorporated as an indispensable element of streets 
given the predominantly hot weather of Indian cities. Trees help in providing shade during hot 
months and reducing ambient air temperatures. 
A major role is also played by trees and green cover in combating air pollution by absorbing 
pollutants, increasing humidity and minimizing soil erosion/dust re-suspension. 
([LVWLQJXUEDQVSDFHVURDGVVKRXOGWKHUHIRUHEHSODQWHGZLWKVXI¿FLHQWDPRXQWRIWUHHVVKUXEV

design and implementation of MFZ are given in Chapters 2 and 3 (in addition to IRC:103-2012,

Water Scarcity and Progressive Irrigation Techniques (Drip Irrigation, Recycled 
Water, Xeriscaping)
With increase in green cover within roads and streets, comes an induced requirement of additional 
water for irrigation. Most cities have inadequate amount of water to spare for irrigating roadway 
planation and therefore innovative techniques such as drip irrigation and use of local recycled 
water needs to become the norm. This manual provides recommendations and technical details 
for drip irrigation planning and other decentralized systems of irrigating roadside plantation in 
Section 3.7 and 4.2.
Xeriscaping is a technique of landscape design that uses negligible amounts of water for 
irrigation. (Please refer Glossary – Xeriscape and Plant Factor). By encouraging this landscape 
technique one can reduce water usage while still have beautiful landscapes adorning public 
spaces. Xeriscaping is particularly recommended for water scarce regions and places that 
receive excessive sunlight. Xeriscaping plants are typically, all species of cactus, yucca and 
succulants.

Erosion Control – Roads in Water-Logged Areas; Bio-Diversity Zones
Erosion in hilly areas is a major cause of natural disasters, and blockages of essential roadways 
and arterials during emergencies. Therefore, erosion control measures are essential for 
maintaining safety and access in such areas. A spectrum of erosion control measures while 
utilizing trees and ground cover effectively for the purpose, have been suggested in Section 3.10 
and Annexure C.
Annexure-A provides a matrix of Tree Properties based on Climatic Zones, so that appropriate 
trees can be selected by designers/horticulturists based on the criteria and guidance provided 
in this document.

Design Approach

	Design Approach Based on Project type
2.2.1
New roads
Decision on where to put drains and bio-swales and where to put plantation keeping in mind 
future widening:
(i)
In new roads, planting shall be done in a way that no movement, cutting or 
transplantation is necessary. To ensure this, the entire RoW should be planned 
to keep future requirements so that no displacement of trees is necessary.
(ii)
For new roads, the two critical aspects to be considered are the location of 
the storm water drain (deciding slopes of the carriageway) and the location 
of the tree lines, such that, future widening of roads and footpaths, etc. is not 
hampered.
(iii)
One row of trees could be planted along the central median, on roads having 
medians of 2.1 m and above,while ensuring clear sight distance and clear height 
as per Fig. 85, with adequate sub-
grade protection as per this manual. 
The width shall also be helpful in 
having refuge space for wheelchairs.
(iv)
As shown in Fig. 9, in Phase 1 of road-
building for 60 m roads and above, 
widening provision can be kept as 
part of a wider median and the second 
row of trees can be planted approx. 
13 m from the center-line. For 45 m, 
it should be 11.5 m. In case of roads 
wider than 45 m, the second row could 
consist of a double row of trees, or a 
third row could be added.

(ii)
Decentralized sewage treatment systems should be designed within a width not 
more than 1.8 m so that they can be positioned within the Multi-Functional Zone, 
as shown in Fig. 12. The length of these systems should be shorter than the 
centre-to-centre distance between the trees. Fig. 12 illustrates this condition.

Road widening
Criteria to be considered during road widening projects incorporating existing tree lines and 
drain locations:
(i)
Existing tree lines should be retained as far as possible and the road design 
should be adapted to their locations. Transplantation of trees should be avoided 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 188
======================================================================
IRC:SP:119-2018
15
and should be the last choice during road widening decisions, although it may 
be preferred over cutting, as shown in Fig. 11 above.
(ii)
Pedestrian zones, cycling lanes and resting spots can be developed around 
existing trees or they could be incorporated into medians so as to avoid their 
cutting or transplantation. Fig. 13 and 14 illustrate how existing tree line was 
retained as a median during road widening for BRTS.
(iii)
The top of existing drains can be readjusted to meet the top height of the footpath, 
such that their top surface can be utilized as a walking surface. Trees can be 
planted on the sides to shade the walking surface.

Planting and Other Elements of Streetscaping
Streetscaping is an increasingly popular term being used in recent times by municipalities around 
the country to improve roads which not only includes landscaping and plantation, but also, 
provision of Street Furniture and various street amenities as part of the road design. Various 
components of Streetscape design are indicated below.
2.4
	Street Furniture
Street furniture is one of the most important component of any street, as it helps in providing 
essential resting space ‘pause points’ and public utility, and helps make the streets more 
enjoyable and safe. All street furniture should be placed in the Multi-Functional Zone and should 
be clear of the designated walking and NMT space, or in resting islands made within the street 
edge, where there is more space available, as shown in Fig. 31 and 32 below.

The Multi-Functional Zone can house the benches and the dustbins, apart from signage, tree 
pits, kiosks, parking and other important utilities. The benches (Fig. 35-37) and dustbins should 
be placed every 50 m on the street to have ample facility for the pedestrians and cyclists (Fig. 
38-39). At every 300-500 m a toilet block should also be provided. Bollards should be placed 
WRGH¿QHWKHGLYLVLRQEHWZHHQWZRGLIIHUHQWXVHRIVSDFHV	WRHQKDQFHVDIHW\EHWZHHQVWUHHW
and footpath, or between cycle track and walkway or between MFZ and cycle track, as shown in 
Fig. 33 and 34 below. Bollards, should preferably be of sitting height 450 mm (Fig. 106) where 
resting spots are developed or of 750 mm (Fig. 105) to provide barrier to vehicles from entering 
the NMT zone. The distance between bollards could be varying from 600 mm to 1100 mm (for 
wheelchair access). Please refer Section 3.6 for construction details.

What to do
What not to do
Plant Choice
Requirement 
for all 
Streetscapes

Preferably 
plant 
trees 
in simple straight lines 
signifying the movement 
direction;

In hot climates, provide for 
shade giving trees, with 
other criteria as per the 
tables below.

Incorporate 
storm-water 
management 
techniques 
based on local soil type;

Use native plantings to 
increase 
longevity 
and 
minimize maintenance.

Trees if not pruned become 
an impediment.

Lack of street tree planting 
makes roads uncomfortable 
to all road users, increases 
heat 
island 
effect 
and 
increase runoff and erosion.

Monocultures are to be 
avoided by breaking the 
single 
species 
planting 
with alternative planting at 
regular intervals.

Permeable paving is most suitable for large paved areas e.g. within the Multi-
Functional Zone, parking lots, driveway kerb-cuts, large plazas, hawker zones,

(ii)
The sub-grade of porous paving surfaces must be porous to a minimum depth 
of 150 mm in order to achieve the desired level of permeability.
(iii)
A number of permeable materials are available for use: like, permeable asphalt, 
concrete, interlocking concrete block, open-celled paving grid, open-celled 
paving grid with gravel, as shown in Table 3.

Application and Design Considerations: In general, sites where pervious pavement will be 
installed needs to meet the following criteria:
(i)
Soils need to have a permeability of at least 12 mm per hour.
(ii)
Areas that have high potential for contamination such as transfer stations, gas 
stations, or highly industrial areas may not be suitable for permeable pavements 
due to the increased risk of ground water contamination (Fig. 46).

through the entire surface.
(iv)
The seasonal high water-table should be at least 1 m below grade.
(v)
It should be installed at least 30 m away from drinking water wells.
(vi)
Pervious pavements should not be used in areas with a slope >15%, as erosion

High density residential frontages require dense tree plantation to provide shade and comfort to 
local pedestrians as well as walkers, children, people of all ages. A well shaded and well-designed 
street fosters community interaction and helps build resilient cities, (Fig. 74). Residential streets 
could be programmed with various types of activities like children play areas, chess-tables, play-
courts; hawker plazas, etc. as shown in Fig. 75 below.

Residential edges may have more than one row of trees to act as view cutters from the main 
carriageway, as shown in Fig. 76. Trees in parallel rows should alternate to provide maximum 
shade. Mixed plantation – high and low branching is preferred, to provide both shade and privacy. 
Fruit trees near residential edges that attract birds and provide food, are preferable. Local storm 
water should drain into the landscaped MFZ or landscaped pits. Soil should not remain exposed 
at any time in the pits.

Response air pollution mitigation
(near industrial areas, busy arterials)
Industrialized areas, places of critical bio-diversity and schools and hospitals require dust 
prevention, noise mitigation and pollution mitigation, which is achieved through dense buffer 
plantation.

(i)
Buffer to consist of at least two rows of plantation, 6 m apart with trees of various 
heights. First row to consist of high branching, high canopy trees with small 
leaves to help trap pollution and dust, as shown in Fig. 78.
(ii)
Second row to be medium to high trees with dense foliage to prevent noise and 
pollution. Lower-storey plantation by high shrubs can further screen and prevent 
noise but should be avoided for reasons of safety. Prefer shrubs that offer some 
visual transparency.

The plant selection should be based on the study of the current bio-diverse region and ecological 
areas where intervention needs to be made. The plants shall be strictly native and no foreign or 
exotic species should be planted. Fig. 82 shows a bio-diverse region.
The following aspects should be considered:
(i)
Plantation should meet with the existing hydrozone. Introduction of new 
hydrozones should be avoided.
(ii)
Lighting has to be carefully planned.
(iii)
For biologically diverse regions close to human habitation or urban areas, buffer 
regions should be planned such that urban activities can be contained to these 
regions and penetration of these activities into the bio-diverse regions avoided. 
These buffer regions should also be landscaped with native species and not 
exotic ones while also considering the activities planned in the zone – like 
trekking/camping, explorations, edible gardening, etc.

(iv)
For uprooted trees, stakes should be provided from at least 3 directions, for 
proper guying of the tree till the tree is re-established.
(v)
As far as possible, trees should not be metaled close to its trunk. A tree pit 
diameter or pit size should be maintained for proper watering of the tree. It helps 
the tree in holding onto the soil and withstanding wind and water pressures.

periods of time.
(ii)
Various varieties of grasses and legumes are ideal for such conditions which 
have the capability to survive long submergence rates while also have the ability 
to clarify water.
(iii)
Water loving trees can also be planted like Salix, Tamarix and Barringtonia. 
These trees transpire huge amounts of water and therefore maintain their 
growth.
(iv)
In areas of high salinity/alkalinity/sodicity, the plants selected should have tubular

For sloped embankments, gentler vegetated slopes are preferred for soil stability and to prevent 
erosion. The impact of the rod runoff should be minimized by grass swales along the road and 
at the top and bottom of the slope to check surface runoff (refer Fig. 84 above). Surface water 
along roads should be directed via natural swales or interceptor drains to existing or designed

especially in hot climates. 
(iii)
Tree pits shall be a minimum of 3.3 sqm area with a minimum dimension of 1.8 
m. in any direction and minimum depth of 1.2 m. However, for medians, small to 
medium height trees should be planted in a pit that’s retained on all sides with a 
minimum internal dimension of 1 m in any direction (refer details in 3.5.1).
(iv)
Tree line should be decided as per the orientation of the street. In case of 
narrower streets where double rows of trees may not be possible, the sunnier 
side of the street should be considered for tree plantation, (e.g. where space is) 
limited for planting, preference is to be given to tree planting on the South/West 
facing side of the road, especially in hot climates.
(v)
Trees and shrubs should be grouped together so that they correspond to a 
single hydrozone, for optimizing water requirements.
(vi)
In order to minimize air pollution through dust re-suspension, tree pits, planters 
or any unpaved areas within the ROW shall not have exposed soil and shall be 
covered by ground covers, shrubs, mulch or any other kind of plantation. Soil

Experience has been that growth of thick vegetation close to the formation on inside of horizontal 
curve leads to serious reduction of sight distance and causes avoidable accidents with cattle/
children suddenly emerging from the side. Uncontrolled trees/vegetation may also affect visibility

Plantation plan coordinated with lighting, utilities and signage
Landscaping and plantation shall be well integrated with utilities and services. The following to 
be considered where utilities and tree plantation are close to each other:
(i)
Utilities to be planned as stacked banks and to be implemented under the 
roadside such that all utilities pack themselves close to each other, resulting in 
better management and maintenance.
(ii)
Where utilities are not planned as banks, provision of ducts should be made that 
encase cables and offer no hindrance to adjoining trees/root systems and can 
be easily maintained.
(iii)
Where electric cables and other cables run close to rooting system of trees and 
plants, the same should be sleeved in PVC sleeves such that the plantation 
does not cause harm to cables.
(iv)
Where drainage pipes and water lines pass, the trees should be planned at safe 
clearance of 0.6 m so that the roots steer clear of the drainage systems.
(v)
The Clear Pedestrian Zone (minimum 1.8 m wide) and Utility Easements/
Common Utility Ducts/Duct Banks must be placed separately from the Tree 
Planting Zone/MFZ, as in Fig. 90.

For example, monoculture street tree plantations of Elm trees saw catastrophic losses of over 
25 million trees in Britain and over 40 million in the US due to the Dutch elm disease in the 
mid- 20th century. They devastated the landscapes of cities across the Northern Hemisphere, 
where there were planted along roads, walkways and hedges because of their overarching 
form and shade. 
A rule of thumb recommendation for street tree plantation is that no more than 10% of any 1 
species, no more than 20% of any one genus, and no more than 30% of any one family are 
planted in a single stretch.
Minimum Species Diversity: To help prevent insect or disease susceptibility and eventual 
uniform senescence on a development site or in the adjacent area, species diversity is 
required and extensive monocultures are prohibited. No more than twelve (12) trees shall be 
used consecutively, and frequent alternation of different species is necessary. Existing trees 
may be included when determining species diversity. Table 10 below shows the desired mix 
of species.

with the varying width of the median in different sections. In sections where 
median width is less than 1.5 m, low height shrubs are recommended with 
low to medium height trees, the branches of which are pruned at 4.5 m 
height. On medians of upto 3 m width, 2-3 rows of shrubs of various varieties 
and medium height trees can also be planted. For medians, more than 3 
m wide, trees with high canopies mixed with low to medium height shrubs 
can be planted. The trees, if planted, should be in a single row along the 
centerline of the median.
(iii)
The shrubs should be at spacing of 0.45 m c/c and size of the pits for planting 
should be 0.6 m x 0.6 m x 0.6 m.
(iv)
For shrub planting in medians, the kerbs shall be 150 mm high and at least 
450 mm deep to retain good soil inside the adjacent walls of the kerb.
(v)
The species recommended for median are ones which can withstand 
pollution, dust, wind speeds and drought conditions and are unattractive to 
cattle. There are many varieties that can be planted and usually Bouganvillea, 
Karonda, Didonia and Kaner are most popular. However, other species 
(listed in the Appendices) may also be used.

The surface for the median plantation should be well prepared. The masses 
of loose debris on the median and any convexities should be removed.

allowed to establish properly on a slope which does not subject it to undue stress 
from erosion and mass movement in its initial stages. A few more measures 
required are given below:

(vi)
A cover of 25 gram of grass seed per square meter of surface should be achieved.
(vii) The timing of sowing is of utmost importance. The seed sowing must be carried 
out before the onset of monsoon [May & June] so that they yield desired results. 
The watering of the surface will be done by tankers till the onset of the monsoon.
(viii) After sowing, mulch of prepared and dried out herbs should be laid over the 
entire seeded area in a thin layer so that the direct sunlight and transpiration 
loss may not affect the grasses

(viii) At the time of establishment, tree plantations require protection from extreme 
climates and vandalism using removable iron/brick tree guards, as shown in 
Fig. 103. Locally available bamboo guards or thorn fencing may also be used 
where protection can be ensured through these guards. Once it is established 
with caliper of 150 mm or more, and able to support itself, the tree guard must 
be removed.
(ix)
Post establishment, trees need to be protected during road widening and/or 
pavement repair and work. Tree guards can be used, as shown in Fig. 104 and 
105. No construction debris, or equipment should be stacked near the tree, to 
avoid strangulation. They need protection till maturity, an example is shown in 
Fig. 106.

habit should not be considered. 
(ii)
Staking to be done for new trees and for uprooted trees only, to add to its 
stability. Staking should be such that it prevents swaying of the truck, as shown 
in Fig. 109.
(iii)
Staking shall be done by driving vertically inside the soil, three stakes of 2 m 
length and 60 mm diameter or 50 mm x 50 mm section made of wood and buried 
inside the soil for at last 50 cm.
(iv)
The stakes shall be tied to tree trunk by means of cotton ties strong enough to 
not let the tree trunk sway. Another method is to drive the stakes inclined into 
the soil with its other end meeting other stakes at the trunk and then tying all 
together by means of cotton tie.

Paving
Paving of footpaths must have adequate subgrade so as to prevent frequent damage, dislocation 
of paver blocks and need for repairs and replacement. A proper sub-grade also provides a 
comfortable and hindrance free walking environment especially to the differently abled, small 
children and older persons. The typical paving sub-grade detail is given in Fig. 115 below which

Soil characteristics determining irrigation
The soil type on the site is a factor in determining how fast and how often water can be applied 
to the plant material. Soil absorbs and holds water in much the same way as a sponge. A given

“Hydrozone” means a portion of the landscaped area having plants with similar water needs and 
rooting depth. A hydrozone may be irrigated or non-irrigated. The design of the irrigation system 
should conform to the hydrozone of the landscape design plan. While planning for irrigation or 
designing an irrigation system, the following shall be considered:
(i)
Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil 
conditions, and plant materials with similar water use. 
(ii)
Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected based on what is 
appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone. 
(iii)
Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from shrubs, 
groundcovers, and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of trees. The mature 
size and extent of the root zone shall be considered when designing irrigation for 
the tree. 
(iv)
Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants shall not be 
permitted. 
(v)
On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan, hydrozone areas shall 
be designated by number, letter, or other designation.

of urban roads, as shown in Fig. 134. Installation can be cheap and, with maintenance, a drip 
system can last as long as or more than other irrigation systems. Drip irrigation applies water to

(i)
With proper management, drip irrigation reduces water loss by 60 per cent or 
ore, compared with traditional watering methods. Because drip irrigation applies 
water just where it is needed, there is little chance of waste through evaporation 
or runoff.
(ii)
The soil moisture remains relatively constant. Water contact with the leaves, 
stems, and fruit of plants is minimized, preventing disease. Rows between plants 
remain dry, which reduces weed growth.
(iii)
Once installed, there is little labor required to operate or maintain a drip irrigation 
system.

The following is to be considered with Drip Irrigation method:
(i)
Drip irrigation shall have a minimum operational lower quarter emission uniformity 
of 80%. A precipitation rate of 19 mm per hour cannot be exceeded. 
(ii)

	Sprinkler Irrigation
Sprinkler irrigation is a common watering method. Sprinkler systems can consist of “hose-end” 
sprinklers that one can set up and move around the yard, or can consist of built-in irrigation 
systems. The following types can be generally used:
L
3RS8S6SULQNOHU%RGLHV
Pop up sprinklers ‘pop up’ when in operation. This ‘pop up’ action helps conceal 
the sprinkler when not in use and reduces potential vandalism. Pop up bodies 
FDQEHXVHGZLWK¿[HGUDGLXVKHDGVJHDUGULYHVDQGURWDU\QR]]OHW\SHVDV
seen in Fig. 136. They come in a variety of sizes and models However, they 
are best used in turf areas due to vegetation blocking the spray path when 
used in garden beds. If these types are used in garden beds, it is important that 
vegetation is kept clear of all sprays.

operate than rotary, spray or drip types of irrigation and deliver larger volumes 
of water per minute.
The following are to be considered with Sprinkler Irrigation method:
(i)
Sprinkler system should be designed for Head-to-Head coverage. Head to 
head coverage means that the placement of the sprinklers allows the spray of 
one sprinkler (or the radius) to completely meet the head of the next sprinkler. 
Sprinkler heads must have a minimum of head-to-head coverage (minimum of 
50% of diameter).

3RSXSVSULQNOHUVVKRXOGEHPPWDOOIRUWKHPRVWHI¿FLHQWGHOLYHU\RIZDWHU
Tall lawns are most common and before mowing day can easily get tall enough 
to get in the way of the spray pattern of shorter sprinklers.
(iii)
Sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution 
uniformity.
(iv)
Sprinklers shall not be used for areas less than 3 m in width in any direction. 
They shall be irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces 
no runoff or overspray.
(v)
Sprinklers shall have a minimum operational lower quarter distribution uniformity 
of 71%.
(vi)
No sprinklers shall be located within 600 mm of any trees or impermeable 
hardscape, including but not limited to sidewalks, carriageways, streets, 
walkways, fencing/boundary walls. 
(vii) Irrigation shall not runoff nor overspray onto impermeable surfaces including but 
not limited to buildings, fencing, property line, public right-of-way. 
(viii) Sprinkler heads on the same valve shall have matched precipitation rates. The 
precipitation rate shall not exceed 19 mm per hour. 
(ix)
Spray heads with or without multi-stream, multi-trajectory rotating nozzles, shall 
have built-in pressure regulation in the body or stem or shall have pressure 
regulating swing joints. 
(x)
Sprinkler heads shall have swing joints or other riser-protection components. 
c)	
Flooding
Flooding is the most common type of irrigation method, which is inexpensive but at the same 
time, is wasteful of water resources in most cases. Flooding is carried out through water mains

the edge of the road.
Disadvantages of Flood-type irrigation:
(i)
Since the water spreads through the movement on the ground, areas closer to 
the source of water outlet tend to get over-irrigated than the ones far from it, 
causing water imbalance and ultimately wasting of the resource.

recycled and potable, to the site. Use of groundwater for irrigation is prohibited. The following 
shall be the criteria for selecting water source:
(i)
Priority one: Use Recycled water 
a.
To be sourced from a nearby Sewage Treatment Plant, from public or 
private facility, and stored on site or directly pumped when required; or
b.
To be sourced by constructing a road-side Sewage Treatment Plant, where 
feasible, by treating domestic waste from underground sewer line, and 
local irrigation system to be setup; or
c.
To be sourced from treating sewage from public toilets.
(ii)
Priority two: Potable water
a.
To be sourced through water mains, hydrant lines, or by tankers.
b.
In special cases where costs of laying lines and constructing sewage 
treatment plants are expensive and a water body is present nearby, water 
can be sourced from drilling a tube well within 25 m distance from the edge 
of water body, and not directly from the water body.
c.
Recycling saline water.

Landscape and planting shall be well integrated with utilities and services. Refer Fig. 137 and 
clause 3.1.3.2 for details on coordinating landscape with services. The following to be considered 
where utilities and come too close to tree planting are close to each other:
(i)
Utilities to be planned as stacked banks and to be implemented under the 
roadside such that all utilities pack themselves close to each other, resulting in 
better management and maintenance.
(ii)
Where utilities are not planned as banks, provision of ducts should be made that 
encase cables and offer no hindrance to adjoining trees/root systems and can 
be easily maintained.
(iii)
Where electric cables and other cables run close to rooting system of trees and 
plants, the same should be sleeved in PVC sleeves such that the plantation 
does not cause harm to cables.

This is one of the most usual issues faced by engineers where tree shade is important to provide, 
but at the same time, sub-grade protection is of utmost importance as tree roots can easily 
deliver water to sub-grade and also enter the region and cause subsistence of the surface. For 
such conditions, the trees should be planned in a cylindrical pipe such that the roots go deeper 
before penetrating the sides. This ensures good and long-lasting protection to sub-grade while

For erosion and sedimentation control, slopes should be stabilized with native 
grasses, shrubs and ground covers, as shown in Fig. 139. For steeper slopes, 
terraces can be created or retaining walls can be used, as shown in Fig. 140.
(iv)
Protect existing vegetation – Tree felling should be at a minimum, with greater 
emphasis on protection of older mature trees with wide canopies to protect the 
biodiversity it supports. Invasive, non-native trees can be replaced, preferably 
in a phased manner, to prevent total loss of tree cover. Compliance to Forest 
Conservation Act and local laws Conservation Act and local laws is required. 
Refer Annexure C.

Waterlogged Areas and Sandy/Desert Areas require site appropriate treatment. 
Aquatic plants in water logged area with successive plants for wetland areas 
along the low areas and drainage runoff to be directed towards these low-lying 
areas. Around water bodies, to prevent erosion, soil stabilization planting is 
essential.
(vi)
Desert planting to be minimal with use of xerophytic planting and key areas.

Various methods are available for hillside and slope stabilizing. Often used methods of seeding 
are dry-seeding and hydroseeding. On exposed areas, the seed will be protected with straw 
in combination with bitumen or meshes of jute and wire. After revegetation with seeding, the 
stabilization can be increased through transplanting stump sprout deciduous trees. With different 
types of brush layering, loose rock slopes can be stabilized. If the plants are rooted, they are 
called hedge layer. If they are unrooted, they are called brush layer. A combination of both is a 
hedge brush layer. A useful method for dewatering and stabilization of wet slopes is the use of 
drain and slope fascines. The fascines consist of live branches of willows that are tied together 
with wire. There are numerous different hillside and slope stabilization methods which utilize 
plants in combination with constructions of wood, stone and wire such as planted pole walls, live 
slope grids, live wooden crib walls, vegetated stone walls and vegetated gabions, as shown in

Transplantation of trees may be carried out to save mature trees along existing ROW, within 
a viable distance of its existing location. Transplantation should be scheduled based on the 
season, expertise and specialized equipment with adequate and careful planning, execution and 
post-transplantation care.
3.11.1
Transplantation of large tree
Occasion may arise when a grown-up tree has to be cut for making room for constructing a 
road, a building or other structure. It would be desirable to save this plant by transplanting it at a 
suitable site. In winter when the tree is dormant or less active, it should be pruned heavily leaving 
a bare framework of the large branches. A 40 to 50 cm wide trench 1 to 2 m deep should be dug 
around the stem as much distance away from it, depending upon the stature of the specimen, 
cutting all the roots, big and small, in the process.
The trench should then be compacted with dry leaf, straw or any such material followed by 
heavy irrigation which would be repeated from time to time according to necessity. In spring, new

simultaneously be covered with several rounds of gunny on which a strong iron chain will be tied 
like a belt. Now a crane would be summoned and the tree securely attached to it through the 
iron chain. The basal roots would then be cut to free the tree from the ground and carried on a 
vehicle to the new site where a suitable pit has already been dug to receive the huge earth ball.

climatic conditions. Even in highly mechanized irrigated plantations, the growth of plants is not 
uniform throughout the year and is governed by the atmospheric factors. It is therefore, vital 
to plan the planting activities in advance as per the prevailing climatic conditions of the area, 
especially the time and duration of monsoon. A suggestive Arboriculture regime is provided in 
Table 19 below. Plantations works are usually started with the onset of monsoon. However, if it 
is possible to provide irrigation,it is advisable to utilize the high temperatures of summers. Plants 
respond well to Irrigation during peak summer seasons, as the conditions are favourable for 
growth if moisture Is not the limiting factor.

	Details of Activities
4.2.1
:DWHULQJRISODQWV,UULJDWLRQ
The quantity of water requirement depends largely on the nature of species, soil quality, depth 
of the aquifer and on the climatic condition of that area. The relative humidity, temperature, 
wind speed and wind direction have major role in this regard. About 450 to 650 litres of water is 
required per plant per year since the very beginning of the plantation till it attains its normal safe 
size and growth i.e. about 6-7 years from the date of plantation. The external supply of water is 
to be continued till the roots of that species may be able to absorb the required quantity of water 
from the soil strata.
The requirement of irrigation based on various criteria are to be as per Table 16 and as per the 
schedule above.

drought tolerant and/or native, till they become established. Mature trees require 
less consistent care, but during droughts need to be monitored and watered as 
required.

is limited to the soil volume that the tree was last grown in (for example, a 
pot or container). Mature, established trees generally require less consistent 
care, but during droughts every tree must be monitored and watered adjusted 
accordingly.
(iii)
For young trees, roots around the trunk need to be watered (not the trunk) and 
not the area outside the root ball. A 1.0 m wide and 2.5 cm to 7.5 cm deep 
organic mulch ring around the trunk for its entire life, will help maintain soil 
moisture.
(iv)
For mature trees (>25 years), or those with a trunk more than 30 cm in diameter, 
water deep and occasionally.

(i)
Cities need to pro-actively design streets, roofs, parking lots, sidewalks and 
other impervious parts of the urban landscape to drain towards trees and planted 
areas. Cities with over 635 mm annual precipitation should use every 93 sqm, 
of impervious surface to water large shade trees for long-term health. In arid 
cities with 200 mm to 380 mm annual precipitation, 372 sqm, of impervious 
surface can irrigate a large street tree. The urban landscape can be graded to 
create berms, mounds, and slopes to turn the entire pervious area into a tool for 
draining water towards tree/planting areas.
(ii)
Trees that have access to larger volumes of loamy soil will then be able to 
withstand dry periods better because of the water reserves the soil can contain.
4.2.2
Irrigation system maintenance
A few important things to consider for maintaining the irrigation system:
(i)
The irrigation systems must be maintained according to the manufacturer’s 
VSHFL¿FDWLRQV DQG LQ DFFRUGDQFH ZLWK DOO ORFDO VWDWH DQG FHQWUDO ODZV DQG
regulations.
(ii)
Irrigation issues that may be observed will be:
a.
Controller malfunctioning. Remedy: regular checks.
b.
Pipe leakage. Remedy: Patching or changing piping on immediate basis.
c.
Choked emitters. Remedy: Passing recommended solvents at prescribed 
intervals through the system to clean up depositions and salts.
d.
Changes in pressure. Remedy: Change irrigation timing or check pressure 
meter and rectify.
e.
Broken pipe. Remedy: Sink the pipe till appropriate depth so that to lessen 
HIIHFWRIZDONLQJPRZLQJRUWUDI¿F
(iii)
Licensed and trained contractors should be employed to conduct regular checks 
to the system to maintain its integrity.
4.2.3
Training and pruning of shrubs
By nature of their growth, shrubs tend to take extra growth or unbalanced growth. Thus, regular 
training and pruning by cutting and removal of undesired parts of twigs is required.
a)	
Training
The process of providing desired form and size to a shrub plant is training. This is done by 
cutting away all growth that does not come in the desired frame, shape and size. Training of 
plants is started when they are still young. 3-4 branches are allowed to grow from main stem 
near the ground, radially to different directions. These are further divided into 2-3 branches each 
making oval shape of 3 m diameter in spread near the ground and 1.5 to 2 m high. This process

Pruning
L

pruning is a must for maintaining the 
clear walking zone within footpaths and 
IURPFRQVLGHUDWLRQVRIWUDI¿FRSHUDWLRQV
and safety.
(ii)
Selective pruning or cutting of trees 
and shrubs will be required at situations 
where these (i) interfere with sight 
distance, (ii) come in the way of effective 
street illumination, (iii) are too close to 
the carriageway so as to be hazardous, 
(iv) conceal desirable views and scenic 
vistas and (v) have become too old or 
dead.
(iii)
Excessive Pruning: Removing more 
than ¼ (25 per cent) of the functioning 
leaf, stem, or root area. Pruning in 
excess of 25 per cent may be injurious 
to the tree and needs to be avoided, as 
shown in Fig. 145.
(iv)
Removal of tree branches obstructing 
VPRRWKWUDI¿FPRYHPHQWDQGJRRGYLHZ
should be carried out judiciously. Similarly, old tree stumps should be removed 
and the area made presentable by suitable means.
(v)
Care should be taken that bark of the plants is not damaged, ruptured, or peeled 
off. 
(vi)
Time of pruning is important and it should be done only in the season of dormancy 
i.e. when the plant is not in active growth. However, light pruning and pinching 
of tips can be done any time when it becomes necessary due to other emergent 
reasons of safety visibility of signs, signals and sanitation etc.
(vii) Maintenance of ground cover through weeding, watering and trimming is 
important to keep the surface usable and easy to maintain.
(viii) Keeping the rest of the areas neat and clean.
The trees and plants should be maintained under the supervision of horticulture staff and new 
plants put up, wherever necessary, in adequate time, especially to replace the dead and old 
trees. Proper working plans should be prepared where the work involves felling of mature trees/
plantation.
4.2.4
Composting and recycling
Collecting and composting leaf litter create valuable sources of nitrogen and phosphorus for soil 
amendments. Done on a regular basis it avoids the clogging drains and pipes.

Plant material shall be handled in a manner so as to cause the least amount of damage during 
the planting process. 
(i)
Inspect trees or shrubs before, during and after they are planted. 
(ii)
Plant pits should be dug or prepared on approval of their location. 
(iii)
Balled and burlapped and container plants shall always be handled by the soil 
ball. Under no circumstances should they be dragged, lifted or pulled by the 
trunk or foliage in a manner that will loosen the roots in the ball. 
(iv)
During transportation, plants should be handled, secured or covered so as 
to prevent damage from wind or vibration. Plants should never be thrown or 
bounced off a truck or loader to the ground. 
(v)
Plant material shall be planted the day it is delivered to the planting site or it shall 
be watered and covered with mulch or soil or placed in a shady area to prevent 
dehydration. 
(vi)
In cases where trees are likely to have their trunks scarred during the planting 
operation, the trunks should be protected with non-abrasive wrap or padding. 
Any bark abrasions or broken limbs caused in the planting operation should be 
treated or corrected immediately. 
(vii) Trees and shrubs should not be dug, balled and burlapped, or moved during the 
active growing period unless the ball is large enough to ensure a reasonable 
chance of survival. 
(viii) Evergreen trees with an excessively bushy growth form shall have the boughs 
tied up with rope or twine during transport and planting to avoid damage to the 
foliage and branches. After planting, the boughs should be released, and all 
twine removed.

	General Guidelines for Planting
(i)
Maintain minimum tree opening in paved areas:
a.
To avoid choking root systems, and compaction, minimum tree opening 
size of 1.8 m x1.8 m to be maintained. This may be covered by tree grates, 
porous pavers or planting, but must be outside of heavy vehicular routes. 
Where compaction occurs, aeration strategies for root systems to be 
added. 
b.
Tree roots should be visible. If only the trunk is visible, then the tree is too 
GHHS7KHSULPDU\URRWVWUXFWXUHVKRXOGEHYLVLEOHLHWKHWUXQNÀDLU
c.
Single strong leader - Where all branching starts from the same point, there 
is a higher chance of fatality. Dominant branches should start at varying 
heights, to avoid lop-sidedness in case of breakage. 
(ii)
Tree Pits
a.
Tree pits should be dug in a ratio of 1: 2 or 3 heights to width.
b.
Circular pits with sloping sides shall be excavated for all balled and 
burlapped and container plants. Trees should be planted so that the trunk 
ÀDLULVDSSUR[LPDWHO\PPDERYHJUDGH7KHSLWVVKRXOGEHDWOHDVWWR
3 times wider and slightly shallower than the depth of the soil ball. All plants 
should be centered in the pit. 
(iii)
Check services
a.
All underground electric or telephone lines, gas lines, water lines or any 
other improvements, public or private, shall be re-checked before planting 
is done. 
(iv)
Planting under Trees
a.
Tree can be subject to root damage (caused by planting and removing

Importance of River Bank
The river banks are not only environmentally sensitive areas and habitats 
IRUORFDOÀRUDDQGIDXQDEXWDOVRGHVLUDEOHSODFHVWKDWSHRSOHZDQWWRYLVLW
explore and enjoy. As the river banks are at a risk to erosion, prior to any 
development of the islands, it is critical that the river banks are protected 
and the island edges are preserved.
There are number of strategies that have been successfully employed 
to preserve river banks these can be broken into two major categories; 
natural and built. 
Natural
The root systems of trees, shrubs, and grasses along the river bank 
bind and hold the it together. The vegetation helps absorb the force 
RIWKHÀRZDQGUHGXFHWKHZDWHU¶VFDSDFLW\WRHURGHWKHEDQNV7UHHV
and shrubs on the banks also provide shade and shelter for aquatic 
DQGWHUUHVWULDOIDXQD*UDVVHVDQGRWKHUJURXQGFRYHUSODQWVKHOS¿OWHU
sediments, nutrients and pollutants from run-off before they enter the 
stream.
The natural strategy attempts to mimic nature by reconstructing a river 
EDQNZLWKULSDULDQÀRUDWKDWKHOSVPDLQWDLQWKHVWUXFWXUDOLQWHJULW\RI
the bank and also serving as a habitat for the fauna.
Built
Rivers bank areas provide people with much needed open space 
and offer people a place away from stresses and strains of urban life. 
Programme along the river edge such as walking & cycle trails, shops 
and restaurants and park areas helps in creating an active and vibrant 
area.
To develop activity zones abutting the river edge requires a more 
engineered or harder edge solution involving the construction of 
retaining structures that can increase the structural stability of the 
edge, provide safe and easy access to the water front and prevent the 
erosion of the river bank.
Natural Vs. Built Edge
Natural erosion control solutions such as planting of vegetation, 
grasses and erosion control mats are used when the maximum 
velocity the river bank experiences is less than 3 m/s. For river bank 
areas experiencing higher velocities built solutions such as rip-rap 
and gabion walls.

wall allows waves to crash into the shore, drastically increasing 
erosion and causing that wave energy to cause damage on 
adjacent shorelines.

Basic idea: Interlocking planks of wood act as a sort of live retaining 
wall, but with less of an environmental impact. Vegetation is planted
