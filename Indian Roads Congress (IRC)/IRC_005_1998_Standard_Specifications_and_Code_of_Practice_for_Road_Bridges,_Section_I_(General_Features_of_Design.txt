GENERAL FEATURES OF DESIGN
INTRODUCTION
The Bridge Code in outline form was originally drafted in 1944-45
by the Bridges Sub-Committee. The Code was redrafted by the Office of
the Consulting Engineer (Roads) in consultation with the members of the
Bridges Committee and was circulated to the Chief Engineers of the Public
Works Departments of all States in India.
It was also discussed at the Indian
Roads Congress Session
at Jaipur held
in
1946.
An expanded Bridges
Committee modified the draft in the light of the comments received from
the Chief Engineers of States* the discussions at the Jaipur Session and the
discussions at the Bridges Committee meeting held from time to time and
this Code was first published in January, 1956.
Some changes had later been approved by the Bridges Committee
in the light of subsequent discussions
at the Committee meeting^s. The
Second and Third Revisions were
published
including
the approved
changes.
The Executive Committee of the Indian Roads Congress approved
the publication of the Fourth Revision
in meU"ic
units. This Code was
revised by the Bridges Committee, and was later published as the Fifth
Revision.
Subsequently the Sixth revision was brought out based on the
provisions contained in IRC:78- 1 983, Standard Specifications and Code of
Practice for Road Bridges, Section VII
- Foundations and substructure.
The General Design Features Committee (B-2) (personnel given
below) in its meeting held on 2 1
. II .96 finalised the draft "General Features

The draft was approved by the Council in their meeting held at
Aizawl on 17.4.97.
This publication
is meant
to serve
as a guide
for engineers,
engaged in the design and/or construction of road bridges. The provisions
herein shall be used with discretion and care shall be taken to ensure that
the stability and soundness of the structures designed and/or constructed as
per these provisions are satisfactory.
The design and construction of road bridges require an extensive
and thorough knowledge of the science and technique involved and should
be entrusted only to specially qualified engineers with adequate practical
experience in bridge engineering and capable of ensuring careful execution
of work.

loads over a depression or obstruction such as channel, road or railway.
These bridges are classified as minor and major bridges as per classification
given below
:
(a) Minor Bridge
: A minor bridge is a bridge having a total length of
upto 60 m.
(b) Major Bridge
: A major bridge is a bridge having a total length of
above 60 m.
Bridges shall be graded as important essentially on the basis of the
seriousness of the consequences of their distress/failure and the extent of
remedial measures involved.
101.1.1.
Culvert
Culvert
is a cross-drainage structure having a total length of 6
metres or less between the inner faces of the dirt walls or extreme venlway
boundaries measured at right angles thereto.

101.3
Clearance
Clearance
is the shortest distance between the boundaries
at a
specified position of a bridge structure.
101.4.
Freeboard
Freeboard at any point is the difference between the highest flood
level
after allowing for afflux,
if any, and the formation
level of road
embankment on the approaches or top level of guidie bunds at that point.
101 .5.
Highest Flood Level (H.F.L.)
Highest flood level is the level of the highest flood ever recorded
or the calculated level for the design discharge.
101.6.
Low Water Level (L.W.L)
Low water
level
is
the
level
of the water surface
obtaining
generally in the dry season and shall be specified in case of each bridge.
101.7.
Length of a Bridge
The length of a bridge structure will be taken as the overall length
measured along
the
centre
line of the
bridge between
inner faces of
dirtwalls.
101.8.
Linear Waterway
Linear waterway of a bridge is the width of the waterway between
the extreme edges of water surface at the highest flood level measured at
right angles to the abutment faces.
101.9.
Effective Linear Waterway
Effective linear waterway is the total width of the waterway of the
bridge at HFL minus the effective width of obstruction. The effective width
of obstruction is to be worked out as per Clause No.

A brief description of the reasons for selection of a
particular
site for the crossing accompanied,
if necessary, with typical
cross-sections of the channel at alternative sites investigated and rejected^
102.2.2.
The cardinal principles to be kept in view at the time
of selection of a particular bridge site including river training works are to
provide
a
suitable
crossing
consistent
with
safety and economy and
acceptable detour from the existing road alignment. The following shall be
the guiding considerations in this regard
:-
i)

location
shall
generally be governed by
the
approach
alignment
witfi minimum
shifting
for improvement of
geometries,
if required, unless there are special bridge design
problems.
ii)
Bridges having total lengths between 60 m and 300 m.
Requirement of a suitable briclge site and proper alignment of
approaches should be considered together and the nK>st suitable
site selected.
iii)
Bridges having total lengths in excess of 300 m.
The requirement of the most suitable site shall have over-riding
consideration and the site so selected shall regulate the approach
alignments.

.
The design discharge for which the waterway of the
bridge is to be designed, shall be based on maximum flood discharge of 50
years* return cycle. In case where the requisite information is not available,
the design discharge shall be the maximum estimated discharge determined
by consideration of the following or any other rational method.
103.1.1.
From
the records
available,
if any, of discharge
observed in the stream at the site of the bridge, or at any other site in its

R.K. Puram, New Delhi. The methodology recommended in the relevant
sub-zone report pertaining
to a particular region may be followed
for
assessment of maximum discharge for the design of bridges.
103.2.
Where
possible, more than one method
shall be
adopted, resuhs compared, and the maximum discharge fixed by judgement
by the engineer responsible for the design.
The bridge shall be designed
for this maximum discharge.
However, for catchment areas covered by
sub-zones mentioned
in Appendix
1(a), the maximum discharge shall be
assessed on the basis of the flood estimation report for the said sub- zone.
103.3.
Freak flood discharges or exceptional discharges of
high intensity due to the failure of a dam or tank constructed upstream of
the bridge need not be catered for and the maximum estimated discharge
from
the catchment
area
or normal peak
flood discharge from
the
dam/spillway (to be ascertained from the Irrigation Authorities), whichever
is more, shall be considered for design of the bridge.
Note:
In cases where the design discharge cannot be properly
quantified and in spill zones of rivers known for freak
floods, the abutments may be designed as abutment piers
to leave scopeforfuture extension.
104. DETERMINATION OF LINEAR WATERWAY AND
EFFECTIVE LINEAR WATERWAY
104.1.
For
artificial
channels
(irrigation, navigation and
drainage), the effective linear waterway should be adequate to pass the full
discharge at designed velocity but concurrence sha)l invariably be obtained
from the authority controlling the channel.
If it is proposed to flume the
channel at the site of the bridge, this fluming shall be subject to the consent
of the same authority and in accordance with the essential requirements.
104.2.
For non-meandering channels
in
alluvial beds but
with well deflned banks and for
all natural channels in beds with rigid
inerodible boundaries, the linear waterway shall be the distance between
banks
at that water surface elevation,
at which the designed maximum
discharge determined in accordance with Clause 103, can be passed without
creating harmful afflux.
104.3.
For
natural channels
in
alluvial beds and having
undefined banks, the effective linear waterway shall be determined from
the design discharge using some accepted rational formula at the discretion
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
of the engineer responsible for the design. One such formula for regime
conditions is
:
w
=
cVq^
where
W
=
regime width in metres (equal to effective linear waterway
under regime condi tion
)
Q
=
the design maximum discharge in m"^/sec;
C
=
a constant usually taken as 4.8 for regime channels but
it
may vary from 4.5 to 63 according to local conditions.
104.4.
If the river is of a flashy nature and the bed does not
submit readily to the scouring effects of the flood, the waterway should be
determined by the area velocity method taking into account the design flood
level and its waterspread, the characteristics of the bed materials and the
water surface slope.
104.5.
In cases of bridges located in tidal zones, where it is
decided to adopt measures likely to affect the volume of the tidal flow and
other characteristics of the tide,
it shall be ensured that no port or harbour
or other installations in the proximity of the bridge are adversely affected.
104.6.
For
calculating
the
effective
linear waterway
(as
defined in Clause 101.9), the width of obstruction due to each pier shall be
taken as the mean submerged width of the pier and its foundation upto the
normal scour level.
The obstruction at the ends due to the abutments or
pitched slopes duly protected shall be ignored.
104.7.
For unstable meandering rivers flowing through a
number of subchannels separated by
land or shallow section of nearly
stagnant water and having width much in excess of the regime width,
it is
necessary to constrict the channel by providing training works to prevent
the main channel from wandering about
freely and for minimising the
resultant oblique attack on bridge foundations and approaches. The extent
of constriction and the design of training works
in such cases should,
preferably, be decided on the basis of model studies, keeping in view the
ultimate economy,
safety,
durability and aiming
at optimal
recurring
maintenance needs of the structure.
104.8.
Effect of presence of Dams, Barrages, Wiers,
Sluice Gates etc.
104.8.1
.
Presence of dams, barrages, wiers, sluice gates etc.,
on the rivers affect their hydraulic characteristics like causing obliquity and
14



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
concentration of flow, scour, silting of bed, change in flow levels, bed levels
etc. These effects shall be considered in the design of bridges depending
upon whether the proposed site of the bridge is upstream or downstream of
a dam or a barrage, or wier etc.
104.8.2.
Since the above parameters depend on many factors
which are varying from site to site, no uniform guidelines can possibly be
laid down. Such problems may be jointly taken up with the concerned
Departments and suitable provision made in the bridge design.
105. SPACING AND LOCATION OF PIERS AND ABUTMENTS
1 05 . 1
.
Piers and abutments shall be so located as to make the
best use of the foundation conditions available.
105.2.
Keeping in view Clause 105.1 above, the number of
supports and
their locations
shall be so
fixed
as
to provide
the most
economical design of the bridge and
at
the same time
satisfy
special
requirements,
if any,
for
navigation,
railways or other crossings
in
consultation with the concerned authorities, floating logs or debris and
bridge aesthetics, etc.
1 05.3.
The alignment of the piers and abutments shall, as far
as possible, be parallel to the mean direction of flow in the channel, as well
as the direction of other piers and abutments in the vicinity, but provision
shall be made against harmful effects on the stability of the bridge structure
and on the maintenance of the channel banks, contiguous to the bridge due
to any temporary variations in the direction and velocity of the current.
105.4.
Placing a pier
at the deepest portion of an active
channel may be avoided by suitably adjusting the number and length of the
spans.
106
. VERTICAL CLEARANCES
106. 1.
In the case of a channel, vertical ctearance is usually
the height from the design highest flood level with afflux of the channel to
the lowest point of the bridge superstructure at the position along the bridge
where clearance is being denoted.
106.2.
Clearance shall be allowed according to navigational
or
anti-obstruction
requirements
in
consultation
with
the concerned
authorities. Where these considerations do not arise, the vertical clearance
shall ordinarily be as follows
:
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
1 06.2. 1
.
For openings of high level bridges, which have a flat
soffit or soffit with a very flat curve, the minimum clearance shall be in
accordance with the following
table. The minimum clearance shall be
measured from the lowest point of the deck structure inclusive of main
girder in the central half of the clear opening unless otherwise specified.

106.2.2.
For arched openings of high level bridges having
overhead decking, the clearance below the crown of the arch shall not be
less than one tenth of the maximum depth of water plus one-third of the rise
of the arch intrados.
106.2.3.
In structures provided with metallic bearings, no part
of the bearings shall be at a height less than 500 mm above the design
highest flood level taking into account afflux,
106.2.4.
In the case of artiflcial channels having controlled
flows and carrying no floating debris, the engineer responsible for design
may, at his discretion, provide less vertical clearance than that gpecifled in
Clauses 106.2.1 & 106.2.2 above.
106.2.5.
In the case of bridges in sub-mountainous region and
across aggrading rivers, silting of the bed of the river should also be taken
into consideration while flxing the vertical clearance.
107. FREEBOARD
107.1.
The freeboard
for
the approaches
to high
level
bridges shall not be less than 1750 mm.
107.2.
For aggrading
rivers
in Himalayan
foot-hills and
flood-prone areas of North-Eastem States, North Bengal etc., the freeboard
shall be suitably increased.

PAGE 27 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
108. RESTRICTED WATERWAYS
Restriction of the waterway as determined by Clause 104 may be
done giving careful consideration
to the resulting effects based on
site
conditions in the individual cases.
When the waterway is restricted to such an extent that the resultant
afflux will cause the channel to discharge at erosive velocities, protection
against damage by scour shall be afforded by providing deep foundations,
curtain or cut-off walls, rip-rap, bed pavement, bearing piles, sheet piles or
other suitable means.
Likewise, embankment slopes adjacent
to
all
structures
subjet
to erosion
shall be adequately protected by
pitching,
revetment walls or other suitable measures.
109. OBSTRUCTIONS AND RIVER TRAINING
Obstruction in the channel bed likely to divert the current or cause
undue disturbed flow or scour and thereby endanger the safety of the bridge
shall be removed as far as practicable from within a distance upstream and
downstream of the bridge not less than the length of the bridge subject to a
minimum of 100 metres in each direction. Attention shall be given to river
training and protection of banks over such lengths of the river as required.
110. DETERMINATION OF THE MAXIMUM DEPTH OF SCOUR
11 0.1.
The probable maximum depth of scour to be taken
for the purpose of designing foundations for piers, abutments and river
training works shall be estimated after considering all local conditions over
a reasonable period of time. The following may
help
in deciding the
maximum scour depth.
110.1.1.
Wherever
possible, soundings
for
the purpose
of
determining the depth of scour shall be taken
in the vicinity of the
site
proposed
for
the
bridge. Such soundings
are
best taken during
or
immediately after a flood before the scour holes have had time to silt up
appreciably. Allowance shall be made in the observed depth for increased
scour resulting from
:
i)
the design discharge being greater than the flood discharge.
ii)
the increase
in velocity due to obstruction in flow caused by
construction of the bridge.
iii)
the'increase in scour in the proximity of piers and guide bunds.
17

======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
110.1.2.
Discharge for Design of Foundations and
Protection Works
To provide for an adequate margin of safety, the foundation and
protection works shall be designed for a larger discharge which should be
a per cent over the design discharge given
in Clause
103,
for which
reference may be made
to the relevant provision contained
in IRC:78
(Bridge Code Section VII).
110.1.3.
The following theoretical method may be adopted
when dealing with the natural channels flowing in non-co-herent alluvium
for the estimation of mean depth of scour 'Dsm' in metres.
1/3
Dsm =
1.34
ksf
where
Db
=
the discharge in Cumecs per metre width. The value of 'Db'
shall be the maximum of the following
:
i)
the total design discharge divided by the effective linear
waterway between abutments or guide bunds, as the case
may be.
ii)
the value obtained taking into account any concentration
of flow through a portion of the waterway assessed from
the
study of the cross-section of the river.
Such modi-
fication of the value may not be deemed applicable to
minor bridges of length
uplo 60 m.
iii)
actual observations, if any.
ksf
=
the silt factor for a representative sample of the bed materials
obtained upto the maximum anticipated scour level and is
given by the expression 1.76Vdm where 'dm'
is the
weighted mean diameter of the bed material in mm.
Note:
i)
The effective linear waterway shall be determined in accordance
with Clause 104.6 and in no case shall exceed the value assessed
as per Clause 104.3.
ii)
A typical method of determining *dm' is set forth in Appendix-2.

The value
to be adopted
for the purpose of design should be

materials collected during the sub-soil exploration.
1 10. 1 .4.
If a river is of flashy nature and the bed does not lend
itself readily to the scouring effect of floods, the formula for Osm given in
the Clause
1 10.1.3 shall not apply.
In such cases, the maximum depth of
scour shall be assessed from actual observations.
1 10.1.5.
For bridges located across streams having bouldery
beds,
there
is
yet no
rational
formula
for determining scour depth.
However,
the formula given
in Clause
110.1.3 may be applied with a
judicious choice of value for Db and Ksf and the results compared with the
actual observations at site or from experiences on similar structure nearby
and their performance and decision taken based on sound engineering
judgement.
If a pucca floor at bed is provided,
it is essential to check the
hydraulic performance of these structures under various flow conditions to
ensure that a standing wave
is not formed on the downstream side which
may result in very heavy scour.
It is also essential to check the usual scour
that may take place downstream of a bed flooring and to make adequate
provision for the same.
If it is not possible to increase the waterway and
avoid the formation of a standing wave, a depressed pucca floor on the
downstream may be provided to contain the standing wave within the floor.
111. KERBS
111.1
The section given in Fig. 2 is indicative and shall be
generally adopted for the road kerb. For bridges across deep gorges, major
rivers, open sea, breakwaters etc. where crash barriers are not provided, the
19



======================================================================

road kerb shall be considered as fully unsurmountable.
In such cases, the
kerb section shown in Fig. 2 shall be suitably modified

APPENDIX!
Clause 103.1.4
UNIT HYDROGRAPH METHOD
The Unit Hydrograph, frequently termed as the unit graph,
is
defined as the hydrograph of storm run-off at a given point in a river,
resulting from an isolated rainfall of unit duration occuring uniformly over
the catchment, and producing a
unit run-off. The
unit run-off adopted is
1 cm depth over a catchment area.
The term
"Unit-Rainfall
Duration"
is the duration of rainfall
excess resulting
in the unit hydrograph.
Usually, unit hydrographs are
derived for specified unit durations, say, 6 hours, 12 hours, etc., and derived
unit hydrographs for durations other than these are converted into unit
hydrographs of the above unit durations. The duration selected should not
exceed the period during which the storm is assumed to be approximately
uniform in intensity over various parts of the catchment. A 6 hours unit
duration is suitable and convenient for studies relating to catchments larger
than 250 sq.km.
The unit hydrograph represents the integrated effects of all the
basin
constants,
viz., drainage
area,
shape, stream
pattern channel
capacities, stream and land slopes.
The derivation and application of the unit hydrograph is based on
the following principles
:
1 )
All the characteristics of the catchment of a river arc reflected in
the shape of the hydrograph of run-off.
2)
At a given point on a river for all storms having the same duration
of rainfall excess above this point and uniformly distributed with
respect to time, the discharge ordinates of the hydrograph arc
proportional to rhe total volumes of storm run-off
This implies
that rainfall excess of say 2 cm within the unit of duration will
produce a run-off hydrograph having ordinates twice as great as
those of the unit hydrograph. Also, if individual hydrographs are
obtained from separate periods of uniform
rainfall excess that
may occur throughout
a storm period, and these are properiy
arranged with respect
to time, the ordinates of the individual
hydrographs can be added to give ordinates representing the total
storm run-off hydrograph for the entire storm period.
35



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:5-1998
Three methods are generally available for giving unit hydrographs
at any point in a river.
i)
By analysis of rainfall and run-off records for isolated unit storms;
ii)
By analysis of the run-off compound hydrographs;
iii)
By computation of synthetic unit hydrographs when sufficient
rainfall and run-off data are not available.
The determination of design flood* after the unit hydrograph has
been derived, involves the following steps
:
a)
Division of catchment into sub-areas, if necessary.
b)
Derivation of design storm and its apportionment to sub-area.
c)
Determination of minimum
retention
rate and calculation of
rainfall excess of design storm.
d)
Arrangement of design storm.
e)
Application of rainfalt excess
to
unit hydrographs
for each
sub-area.
0
Routing of flood for each sub-area to the point of collection of the
whole catchment.
A rational determination of critical design storm for a catchment
requires a comprehensive study of major storms recorded in the region and
an evaluation of effects of local conditions upon
rainfall
rate. This
is
particularly necessary in the case of design storms covering a large area of
several thousand s^tiare kms.
In the case of areas less than a few thousand square kms, certain
assumptions can be made regarding rainfall patterns and intensity variations
without being inconsistent with meteorological causes.
They simplify
design-storm estimation, but would entail high degree of conservation.

TYPICAL METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF WEIGHTED
MEAN DIAMETER OF PARTICLES (dm)
Representative disturbed samples of bed materials shall be taken
at every change of strata upto the maximum anticipated scour depth. The
sampling should start from 300 mm below the existing bed. About 500 gms
of each of the representative samples so collected shall be seived by a set
of standard seives and the weight of soil retained in each seive is taken. The
results thereof are then tabulated. A typical
test result
is shown below
