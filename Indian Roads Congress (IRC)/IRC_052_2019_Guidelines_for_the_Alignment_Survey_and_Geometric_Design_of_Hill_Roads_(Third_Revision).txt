GUIDELINES FOR THE ALIGNMENT SURVEY AND  
GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF HILL ROADS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1	
India is a vast country with diverse geological, climatic regions. Indian road network 
passes through different terrains including hills and mountains. Hilly regions consist of Himalayan 
region from North to North-East, the Central Highlands of Aravalli, Western and Eastern Ghats. 
The Himalayan region on its own covers about a fifth of the country’s total area and about 
3000 km of India’s international borders. Hilly regions are generally deprived of Rail and Air 
connectivity with respect to plain terrain. Hence socio-economic development and strategic 
needs have resulted in lack of massive road construction programmes in hilly regions and such 
activities have increased many folds. 
1.2	
The Hill regions including the road networks are affected more frequently by floods 
due to torrential rainfall, landslides, snow avalanche etc. which compel many sections of road 
network closed during rainy season and winter season. 
1.3	
Design of hill roads need not be restricted to the absolute minimum values set out. 
Where conditions are favorable and the costs not excessive, use of more liberal values than the 
minimum should be preferred. 
1.4	
The recommendation about the Alignment Survey and Geometric Design of Hill Roads 
was first published in 1973 and revised in 1982 and 2001. 
1.5	
During the third meeting of Hill Roads and Tunnels Committee (H-10) held in Delhi on 
24.05.2018, it was discussed that the IRC:52-2001 “The Alignment Survey and Geometric Design 
of Hill Roads” is dealing with the same chapters which are covered under IRC:SP:48-1998 “Hill 
Road Manual”. Accordingly, the Committee decided to revise IRC:52 to incorporate the latest 
advancement in the field of alignment survey, equipment etc. and reference of the same would 
be given in IRC:SP:48 which is under revision. The draft was deliberated in various meetings of 
H-10 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 6th October, 2018 for placing before the 
Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS). The revised draft was placed before 
the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 23rd October, 
2018. The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to the consideration of the observations of 
members. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 27th October, 2018 approved the draft 
for placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its 216th meeting held on 22nd November, 
2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) considered and approved the same for printing.
The composition of H-10 Committee is given below:

3. SCOPE
3.1	
The standard is relevant to new road as well as for improvements of existing roads. It 
is, however, not applicable to urban roads or city streets situated in hilly terrain. 
3.2	
The text deals with two main aspects of hill road construction, namely, alignment 
surveys for route selection and geometric design of the alignment. The first aspect, namely, the 
alignment survey including reconnaissance and preliminary surveys etc. are discussed. The 
various elements of geometric design are covered including brief planning criteria.
4. PLANNING CRITERIA
4.1 
Classification of Hill Roads
4.1.1	
As in the case of roads in plains, hill roads may be classified as one of the following :
	
(a)	
National Highways
	
(b)	
State Highways
	
(c)	
Major District Roads
	
(d)	
Other District Roads
	
(e)	
Village Roads
4.2	
Planning of Roads in Hill Areas
4.2.1	
Planning of road in hill areas is much different from that in plains. Significantly, large 
number of villages are sparsely populated and isolatedly located at different altitude unlike in 
plain areas. It is usually not possible topographically as well as economically to directly link them 
with motorable roads. Alignment of roads has, thus, to be circuitous and is primarily governed by 
topography and geological formation.
4.2.2	
In hilly areas, road links should be provided on the basis of cluster or group of villages 
as far as feasible because the population of each village may be very low. Villages located within 
a radius 1.6 km and having altitude difference of not more than 200 m can be considered as 
one cluster or groups of villages. Isolated villages, having population more than 250 should be 
provided with an all-weather link road. For a cluster of villages of population less than 250, a 
selective approach of an all-weather road may be worked out keeping in view the local conditions. 
4.2.3	
For new roads, connecting new areas an assessment of traffic likely to be generated 
can be done by studies on population and consumer needs, development plans for the area and 
traffic on adjacent roads.
4.3	
Ecological Consideration
4.3.1	
Construction of roads in hilly region disturbs the ecosystem in many ways. The main 
ecological problems associated with hill roads construction are : 
	
i)	
Geological disturbances
	
ii)	
Land degradation, soil erosion and landslides



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 68
======================================================================

IRC:52-2019
5
	
iii)	
Destruction and denuding of forests
	
iv)	
Interruption and disturbance of drainage pattern
	
v)	
Loss of forestry and vegetation
	
vi)	
Aesthetic degradation 
	
vii)	
Siltation of water-reservoirs 
These factors underline the need to plan, align and construct hill roads after careful thought. The 
help of geologists and environmental specialists should, therefore, be enlisted while planning for 
hill roads. Hill Road Manual IRC:SP:48 may be referred for details in this regard. 
In respect of environmental impact assessment, reference may be made to IRC:SP:19-2001 
‘Manual for Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road Projects’ and other IRC codes.
5. SURVEY AND ALIGNMENT OF HILL ROADS
5.1	
General
5.1.1	
In this section, guidelines for carrying out survey work to fix the alignment of hill roads 
situated primarily in a rural or non-urban area are given. 
5.1.2	
The requirement of the road is decided based on administrative, developmental, 
strategic, other needs and the obligatory points to be connected by the road. Control points 
between obligatory points are governed by saddles, passes, valleys, river crossings, vertical and 
over-hanging cliffs, forest and cultivated land and other natural features like escarpments, slide-
prone, avalanche-prone and other unstable areas.
5.1.3	
In order to explore the possibility of various alternative alignments, preliminary 
investigation shall start from the high obligatory or control summit points and proceed downwards. 
The alignment finally selected linking the obligatory and control points shall fit in well with the 
landscape. The aim shall be to establish a safe, easy, short and economically possible line of 
communication between the obligatory points considering the physical features of the region 
and traffic needs apart from least disturbance to the eco-system and the prevailing High Tension 
line, existing service lines. Ideal road alignment is the one which will cause the least over-all 
transportation cost including safety for road users taking into account the costs of construction, 
maintenance, and recurring cost of vehicle operation.
5.1.4	
Introduction of hair-pin bends shall be avoided or minimized as far as possible. The 
bends shall be located on stable hill slopes, and their location in valleys avoided. Series of hair-
pin bends on the same face of the hill shall be avoided.
5.1.5	
Economy in operating cost of transport vehicles is achieved by adopting easy grades, 
minimizing rise and fall and by following a direct line as far as possible between obligatory 
points. Although shortest distance is an important factor, it may have to be sacrificed, at times, 
in order to obtain easy curvature and gradients, to avoid prohibitive cuts or fills and long river 
crossings and obstructions. Even a longer road length to ease gradient and curves may result in 
a more economical operating cost. Therefore economy in operating cost/road safety shall be the 
governing criteria in selecting the alignment of these roads.

5.2.2	
To facilitate the survey team in the tentative selection of alternative routes for 
subsequent detailed ground reconnaissance, the available topographical survey data shall be 
studied from the satellite or remote sensing data and topographical survey sheets.

Reconnaissance
5.3.1	
General
Once the obligatory points are known, the next step will be to undertake reconnaissance survey 
in the following sequence:
	
a)	
Study of Satellite or remote sensing data along with topographical survey sheets, 
geological, meteorological, forest maps and aerial photographs, wherever 
available.
	
b)	
Preliminary reconnaissance and identification of possible routes connecting the 
obligatory points on the maps prepared based on Satellite or remote sensing 
data.
	
c)	
Fixing the possible routes based on longitudinal profile generated through 
satellite data, minimum distance, optimizing cutting and filling, availability of land 
(desired width), following basic factors of geometric design for desired speed, 
radius of curve, gradient.
	
d)	
Refinement of the alternative routes by correcting the aforesaid fixed routes by 
avoiding obstructions like minimum interference of forest area, habitant area but 
nearer to the habitant area, minimum crossing of Linear services like Railway 
lines, Canals, High Tension lines, Utilities network.
5.3.2	
Reconnaissance with satellite data
Reconnaissance with Satellite/remote sensing data will provide a bird’s eye view of the routes 
under consideration and the surrounding area. The alternative routes are marked on satellite 
data. These marked routes are to be corrected based on features on Topographical sheets 
which are available in the scale of 1 : 50000, i.e. 2 cm to 1 km, showing towns, villages, rivers 
and terrain features with altitudes and contour lines at intervals of 20 m. Close study of these 
sheets and the geological and meteorological maps of the area is essential in order to locate the 
obligatory and control points and to mark tentative alternative feasible routes on the topo sheet 
for further survey on ground.

b)	
Decide on control points.
	
c)	
Identify the alternative route maps, if so needed, for taking up ground 
reconnaissance.
5.3.4	
Ground reconnaissance
The various alternative routes found feasible as above are further verified physically in the field 
by ground reconnaissance to recommend the final route. It consists of general examination 
of the ground by walking or riding along the probable routes and collecting all essential and 
available data as per guidelines given in Appendix-1.
5.3.4.1	
It will be advisable to associate a Geotechnical Engineer or Geologist with this work. 
Where necessary, local habitants shall also be associated with ground reconnaissance.
5.3.4.2	
Traversing on the ground with hand GPS demonstrating the coordinates of the location 
shall be done during the ground verification. Points should be kept in mind that structures and 
utilities along the survey location should be noted along with the offset from the centre line of 
the survey alignment. This should cover all the necessary additional features along the identified 
routes. Best fit alignment route shall be selected in such a manner that would require minimum 
disturbance to structures and utilities with economical cost and maximum benefits with respect 
to socio economic concern of the survey alignment.
5.3.4.3	
On the out set topographical survey ground control points should be installed at 250 m 
interval with help of Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS).
5.3.4.4	
Ground penetrating radar technique needs to be adopted for mapping of under ground 
utility lines of water pipe lines 
5.3.4.5	
The general method of ground reconnaissance and fixing route/grade pegs by the 
reconnaissance team shall be as below:
	
(a)	
A starting point is fixed near the first obligatory point at a higher ground from 
the surrounding area from where one can see the next obligatory and/or some 
nearby control points. Being the starting point of the traverse survey, a cement 
concrete masonry block of dimensions 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm (deep) with upper 
surface 20 cm above the ground shall be erected on which the bench mark/
altitude, chainage, etc. shall be marked. From the altitudes of the two control 
points the approximate distance to be traversed between these two points can 
be ascertained taking into consideration a gradient flatter than the ruling gradient 
by 20 per cent or so (if ruling grade is 5%, grade assumed is 4%) depending 
on slope of the hill side. The jungle ahead of the fixed point is cleared along the 
route for placing and sighting the alignment and ranging poles. The width of 
jungle clearance shall be 0.6-1.2 m or even more if required. The direction of, 
route shall be checked.
	
(b)	
With abney level and/or ghat tracer the route line along the hill face shall be 
ranged at the required grade and the corresponding position on ground located 
by ranging rod and driving the grade peg into the ground, keeping the top of 
peg at level as per required gradient. Such grade pegs may be positioned at 
intervals between 25-100 meters or closer where required.



======================================================================

(c)	
The distance of the grade peg from the preceding one is measured and recorded 
in field book. On the peg, the serial number, distance, gradient (rise/fall) are 
marked in paint. The process is repeated at next location.
	
(d)	
The indication of the grade peg for the detailed survey party shall be marked by 
a clearly visible sign noticeable from a distance on the route. This is generally 
done by debarking a portion of a nearby tree of size 20 cm by 10 cm at the 
eye level and indicating in red paint direction, distance, the serial number and 
chainage of the connected grade peg. In places, where trees are not available, 
the hill face near the grade peg may be levelled about 30 cm square and then 
a pole at about 2 meter high with a cross piece tied to it is firmly fixed near the 
peg to indicate the position of the connected grade peg. In rocky area the level, 
line could be marked on the rock face with red paint and details required, as 
above, be written just above the level line. Any other method, depending upon 
the terrain and local facility available, may be adopted; the main aim being that 
the survey party for detailed survey, to be done later, shall not have any difficulty 
in locating the reference and grade pegs on the route. However. the method 
adopted shall be clearly indicated in the field book and reconnaissance report.
	
(e)	
Whenever a high hill range has to be crossed, it is essential to select a suitable 
pass or saddle (which becomes a control point) and to work from the top 
downwards. This is more convenient than working from bottom upwards, as 
in the latter case, there is a possibility of missing the pass or saddle especially 
when the area is dense jungle.
	
(f)	
Cross sections are taken with Abney level at about 25 to 100 meters apart or 
any other interval convenient to indicate the hill slope. Notes will have to be 
recorded in field book on the following points:
	
(i)	
Nature and classification of soil (including rock out-crops, if any) encountered
	
(ii)	
The character of waterways and streams
	
(iii)	 Approximate span and type of culverts and bridging required
	
(iv)	 Availability of materials such as timber, stone, gravel, sand, etc.
	
(v)	
Location of quarries
	
(vi)	 Possible camping places and availability of drinking water
	
(vii)	 Any other useful information like availability of local labour, air dropping 
zone, helipad, etc.
	
(g)	
It has to be ensured that the survey and recording are made accurately by timely 
checking. A fortnightly progress report alongwith a diagrammatic chart showing 
the rough L-Section and also hill slopes (which need not be to scale) shall be 
prepared and submitted to the Engineer who ordered the survey. It shall contain 
adequate information to enable the Engineer to get a fairly good idea, not only 
on the progress of the ground reconnaissance. but also on the suitability of the 
proposed alignment.
5.3.5	
Similar procedure for carrying out the preliminary ground reconnaissance and 
submission of report in A2 size shall be followed by the Survey Team in respect of all alternative 
routes also.

5.3.6	
Reconnaissance report
On completion of reconnaissance survey on all the alternative routes, a report along with 
a comparative statement of the alternative routes in the proforma given at Appendix-2 
shall be prepared along with recommendations on the alignment to the Engineer. The 
report shall contain a plan on the scale of 1: 50,000, showing alternative alignments along 
with their general profile and rough cost estimate. A sample of topo-sheet, showing two 
alternative alignments proposed, is given in Plate-1. The Engineer of the area shall carry 
out inspection of the alternative alignments. Ground reconnaissance may disclose certain 
difficult stretches which call for detailed examination. A trace-cut might be made in such 
sections for inspection. 
5.4	
Preliminary Ground Survey
5.4.1	
General
This survey consists of pegging at 20 or 25 m intervals the route previously selected on the basis 
of the reconnaissance survey more accurately and at regular and close intervals, cutting a trace 
1.0 to 1.2 m wide and running an accurate traverse line along it by taking longitudinal and cross 
sections of the alignment establishing bench marks at convenient intervals and fixing reference 
pegs where the direction of the alignment changes. The data collected at this stage shall form 
the basis for the determination of the final centre line of the road. For this reason it is essential 
that every precaution is taken to maintain high degree of accuracy. Besides the above, general 
information concerning traffic, soil conditions, construction materials, drainage etc., relevant for 
fixing the design features shall also be collected during this phase. 
5.4.2	
This survey may be done in the following sequences:
	
a)	
Jungle clearance
	
b)	
Pegging the alignment
	
c)	
Trace cut
	
d)

5.4.3	
Jungle clearance
An advance party with required labourers and tools shall commence clearing the jungle along 
the selected alignment to provide clear sight distance for three or four ranging pole/levelling 
staff positions at a time on each direction of the alignment. The party shall commence work at 
least three days before the pegging party. The necessary clearance from forest department as 
required has to be obtained.
5.4.4	
Pegging the alignments
A party consisting of the following personnel with necessary equipment shall commence 
checking grade level, directions and curvature of the alignment arrived at earlier, during 
the reconnaissance refixing the correct alignment and repegging the alignment at 
convenient and workable distance, two to three days after the jungle clearance has 
progressed:

stage shall be easier than the proposed to be achieved on the road by a margin of 20 per cent 
or so as stated in para 5.3.4.5 (a). Procedure for pegging will be the same as in para 5.3.4.5 sub 
paras (c) and (d). However, the intervals of the pegs shall be 20 or 25 m as per ground and terrain 
condition. The size of the pegs may be 6 cm dia or square and 60 cm long out of which 45 cm be 
driven into the ground. The indication about the grade shall be provided at conspicuous locations 
so as to be easily visible from a distance as mentioned in para 5.3.4.5 sub paras (b) to (d).

Trace Cut will be about 1.0 meter wide track cut along the selected alignment to facilitate access 
to the area for inspection and survey. It may not be possible to cut a trace where the pegged 
route traverses precipices and may, therefore, be detoured by cutting the trace either along the 
top or bottom periphery of these areas.
5.4.7	
Machans
In continuous long stretches of rock, with sheer vertical faces where trace cutting is not possible, 
machans can be constructed by erecting framework with locally available-ballies, resting on 
suitable ledges or pegs driven in the crevices/cracks in the rock-face on the valley side. 0.75 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 68
======================================================================
IRC:52-2019
12
to 1.0 m wide platform/decking of ballies/bamboos with suitable railing wherever required, is 
provided on the top of the framework. Where suitable ledge/support is not available, the machans 
are constructed by hanging cane suspenders from trees or pegs driven in crevices/cracks on 
the rock-face on hill side and the platform/decking is tied to these cane suspenders. Typical 
sketches of machans are shown in Fig. 5.1. Where the rock is steep and inaccessibly deep for 
construction of machans, temporary pathways can also be developed by driving jumpers of iron 
rods into the rock-face and putting wooden ballies or planks over them for the men to safely walk 
along.
Fig. 5.1 Machans
The speed of construction of trace cut machans depends on the terrain and strength/skill of 
working party. For guidance and planning purpose, it may be assumed that a working party of 
about 50 – 100 labourers under a resourceful/imaginative supervisor/officer can achieve a daily 
progress of about 0.5 to 1.0 km of trace-cut in ordinary soil and 0.25 to 0.5 km in average rocky 
area, depending on cross slopes and jungle growth. The speed of construction of machans 
depends on availability of local materials like ballies/bamboos/cane, suitability of location for 
construction and skill of labourers. A gang of about 20 to 25 labourers can construct about 50 to 
60 meters of machans per day in easy locations, whereas the speed can be as low as 10 to 15 
meters per day in difficult locations.
Where ballies/bamboos are not easily available either because of non-availability or because 
of restrictions for their extraction, machans may be constructed using pre-fabricated angle iron 
section of 1.0 m to 1.5 m length which could be easily bolted at site.
5.4.8	
Survey procedure
The survey shall cover a strip of sufficient width taking into account the degree and extent of cut 
fill, with some allowance for possible shift in the centre line of the alignment at the time of final 
design. Normally a strip width of about 30 m in straight or slightly curving reaches (i.e. 15 m on 
either side of centre line) and 60 m at sharp curves and hair-pin bends (i.e. 30 m on either side 
of centre line) shall meet the requirement.

Traverse along the trace cut shall be run with a Total Station. No hard and fast rule can be laid 
down as regards distance between two consecutive transit stations. In practice, the interval 
will be dictated by directional changes in the alignment, terrain condition and visibility. The 
transit stations shall be marked by means of stakes and numbered in sequence. These shall be 
protected and preserved till the final location survey.
Physical features such as buildings, monuments, burial ground, burning places, places of 
worship, pipelines, power/telephone lines, existing roads and railways lines, stream/river/canal 
crossings, cross drainage structures, etc. that are likely to affect the project proposals shall be 
captured by Total Station. Ground levels along the trace cut shall be taken at intervals of 20-
25 m and at closer intervals whenever there are abrupt changes in slope and also establishing 
bench marks at intervals of 250 meters, exceptionally 500 meters, by running check levels on a 
closed traverse basis independently. It is particularly important that a single datum, preferably 
GTS datum, is used.
Cross sections shall be taken at intervals of 20 or 25 m and at points of appreciable change in 
soil conditions. While taking cross sections, soil classifications shall also be recorded. At sharp 
curves and difficult locations, detailed capturing of data shall be done for the plotting of contours. 
Interval of contours may be 2 m though this could be varied according to site conditions.
Now a days the survey is done with the help of D.G.P.S (Differential Global Positioning System) 
instrument & Total station which gives accuracy to ± 1mm. 
Control points are established with the help of D.G.P.S instrument. For this purpose, a set of 
two pillars are generated along the road length. Usually size of pillar shall be 45x45x90 cm in 
M25 concrete with 60 cm embedded in the ground and 30 cm above the ground and metal plate 
at top. These points are prepared in such a way that are not likely to be disturbed during the 
construction activities. Normally these set of two pillars (spaced between 20 to 50 meters) are 
spaced about 4 to 5 kilometers with one set of pillars at the start of road project and one at the 
end of project. Each of these pillars have numbering and are associated with co-ordinate i.e. 
x, y & z. (i.e. Easting, Northing & elevation w.r.t. mean seal level). These x,y,z coordinates of 
these control pillars are determined accurately with help of DGPS instrument. The z values are 
transferred accurately from the nearest GTS level using the Auto levels.
Once the D.G.P.S control points are established then with the help of Total Station & prism. 
T.B.M (Temporary Bench Mark, normally spaced at an interval of 250 meters) are indentified and 
fixed on the ground which have separate No’s & Co-ordinates (x, y & z) similarly other reference 
pillars can be generated so that each and every point coming in road alignment is assessable 
to at least two such points. The accuracy of survey can be checked when we start from one 
control D.G.P.S point and when another D.G.P.S. point is reached, their co-ordinates should tally 
because with two known points the location of any third point can be generated and so on the 
process is continued till a point is reached of known co-ordinates and if survey is correct then 
both their values of co-ordinates should tally. The coordinates of the temporary Benchmarks are 
fixed by carrying out traversing between the known control points
Then with help of total station, the contouring of the area is done by taking cross section at 
intervals of 5-10 m on curves and 20-25 m on straight line and the plan and profile of proposed 
road is prepared meeting the requirements of gradient, curvature and speed as per technical 
specifications.

Map Preparation
5.5.1	
At the conclusion of the ground survey plan and longitudinal sections (tied to an 
accurate base line) are prepared for detailed study to determine the final centre line of the road. 
At critical locations like sharp curves, hair-pin bends, bridge crossings etc, the plan shall also 
show contours at 2 m intervals, so as to facilitate taking final decision.
5.5.2	
Scales for the map shall generally be the same as adopted for the final drawings. 
Normally horizontal scale might be 1:1000 and the vertical scale 1:100. For study of difficult 
locations such as steep terrain, hair pin bends etc., it may become necessary to have plans to a 
larger scale.
It will be a good practice to do survey work in the forenoon and plotting work in the afternoon so 
that any doubts arising can be cleared immediately thereafter by ground verification.
5.6	
Determination of Final Centre Line
5.6.1	
Determination of final centre line of the road in the design office involves the following 
operations:
	
a)	
Detailed study shall be done of the plans, longitudinal profile, cross-sections 
and contours of the final alignment prepared during the ground survey to work 
out various alternatives for the centre line of the proposed road. Out of these, 
the best one satisfying the engineering, aesthetic, economic and environmental 
requirements shall be selected as the final Centre Line. Factors like economy in 
earth work, least disturbance to hill slope stability, efficient drainage, balanced 
cut and fill, requirement of protective works such as retaining/breast walls, etc. 
shall be kept in view while making the final choice.
	
b)	
For the selected final center line, a trial grade line is drawn taking into account 
the control points which are established by mountain passes, intersections with 
other roads, river crossings, unstable areas etc. In the case of improvements to 
an existing road, the existing levels are also kept in view.
	
c)	
For the centre line finally chosen, study of the horizontal alignment in conjunction 
with the profile is carried out and adjustments made in both, as necessary for 
achieving proper co-ordination.
	
d)	
Horizontal curves including spiral transitions are designed and the final centre 
line marked on the map. A typical example of Final Centre Line chosen is given 
in Plate-2.
	
e)	
The vertical curves are designed and the profiles are shown on the longitudinal 
sections.

Final Location Survey
5.7.1	
General
The purpose of final location survey is to layout the final centerline of the road in the field based 
on the alignment selected in the design office and to collect necessary data for preparation of 
working drawings.
5.7.2	
Transit survey
The Final Centre Line of the road, as determined in the design office, is translated on the 
ground by means of a continuous Total Station survey and pegging of the centre line on the 
ground as the survey proceeds. It will be necessary to fix reference marks, to be pegged along 
the final centre line for this purpose. These marks shall be generally 20 m apart in straight 
reaches and 10 m apart in curves. To fix the final centre line, reference pillars/control blocks of 
cement concrete of size 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm deep shall be firmly embedded in the ground. 
These shall be located beyond the expected edge of the cutting on the hill side. The maximum 
spacing of reference pillars may be 100 m. The following information shall be put down on the 
reference pillars:
	
a)	
Reduced distance of the reference pillar/block
	
b)	
Horizontal distance of the pillar/block from the centre line of the road
	
c)	
Reduced level at the top of the reference pillar
	
d)	
Formation level of the final centre line of the road.
The reference pillars shall be so located that these do not get disturbed during construction. 
Description and location of the reference pillars shall be noted in the field book for reproduction 
on the final alignment plans. Distance of the reference pillars from centre line of road shall 
be measured along the slope, the slope angle determined with Total Station, and the actual 
horizontal projection calculated.
The final centre line of the road shall be suitably pegged at 20 meters or closer intervals. The 
pegs are intended only for short period for taking levels of the ground along the centre line and 
the cross-sections with their reference. In the case of existing roads, paint marks may be used 
instead of pegs. Distance measurements along the final centre line shall be continuous, following 
the horizontal curves, wherever these occur. The sub-group for this operation may comprise of 
the following personnel:
a) Junior Engineer
- 1 No.
b) Surveyor/Overseer
- 1 No.
c) Helper
- 2 Nos.
d) Labour

5.7.3	
Bench marks
To establish firm vertical control for location, design and construction, bench marks established 
during the preliminary survey shall be rechecked and where likely to be disturbed during 
construction, re-established at intervals of 250 meters (but not more than 500 meters), and at or 
near all drainage crossings.
5.7.4	
Longitudinal sections and cross-sections
Levels along the final centre line shall be taken at all pegged stations and breaks in the ground. 
Cross-sections shall be taken at 20 m intervals. In addition, cross-sections shall be taken at 
points of beginning and end of spiral transition curves, at the beginning, middle and end of 
circular curves, and at other critical locations. All cross sections shall be with reference to the 
final centre line, extend normally up to the right-of-way limits and show levels at every 2-5 meter 
intervals and all breaks in the profile.
Centre line profile shall normally be continued at least 200 meters beyond the limit of the road 
project. This is intended to ensure proper connecting grades at both ends. With the same 
objective, profile along all intersecting roads shall also be measured up to a distance of about 
150 meters. Further, at railway level crossings, the level of the top of the rails, and in the case of 
subways the level of the roof, shall be noted. On existing roads, level shall be taken at all points 
of intersection in order to help fix the final profile.

m shall be constructed with its identification as one of the km stone of the respective NH. Its 
properties w.r.t. coordinates shall be engraved. Its spacing can be kept as 90-100 km along the 
road network.
5.7.5.2	
The final location survey is considered complete when all necessary data and 
information are available and ready for the designer to be able to plot the final profile and prepare 
the project drawings and detailed estimate. Among other things, field notes shall give a clear 
description and location of all the bench marks and reference points. This information shall be 
transferred to the plan drawings so that at the time of construction, the centre line and the bench 
marks could be located in the field without any difficulty.
At the time of execution, all construction lines will be set out and checked with reference 
to the final centre line established during the final location survey. It is important, therefore, 
that not only all the points referring the centre line are protected and preserved but these 
are so fixed at site that there is little possibility of their being disturbed or removed till the 
construction is completed. In the last stage of alignment survey, hydrological and soil 
investigations for the route should be carried out. These will enable details and protective 
works to be decide.
5.7.6	
The survey and fixing of alignment having been done, the stage has been reached to 
design the road as per standards.

6. GEOMETRIC DESIGN
6.1	
General
Hill roads have mostly to negotiate through difficult topography, inhospitable terrain and extremes 
of climatic conditions. As such, design of hill roads to predetermined standards, considering 
importance of safety and free flow of traffic, is necessary so that travel is safe and comfortable. 
Geometric design standards have been laid down keeping above in view.
6.1.1	
Basic principles of geometric design
6.1.1	
Design criteria of hilly terrain shall be applied where stretches of plain/rolling terrain 
are short and isolated. Similarly, the stretches where hilly terrain intervenes for short and/or 
isolated stretches in plain/rolling terrain, criteria for such stretches shall be as per standards for 
plain/rolling terrain.
6.1.2	
A uniform application of design standards is desirable for safe and smooth flow of 
traffic. The use of optimum design standards will reduce the possibility of early obsolescence of 
the facilities likely to be brought about by inadequacy of the original standards.
6.1.3	
As a general rule, geometric features of a highway except cross sectional elements 
do not lend to stage construction, particularly in the case of hill roads. Improvement of features 
like grade and curvature at a later date can be very expensive and sometimes be impossible. It 
is, therefore, necessary that ultimate geometric requirements of hill roads are kept in view right 
in the beginning.
6.1.4	
Development of cross-section in stages is technically feasible. But this shall be 
decided only after very careful consideration, since hill roads need a lot of protective and 
drainage works like retaining walls, breast walls, drains of various types and categories 
etc, consistent with safety and sometimes the road may have to be altogether rebuilt when 
same is upgraded. If stage construction is unavoidable, better strategy will be to use dry 
masonry and/or crated masonry for drains, breast walls, pitching etc, locate the interceptor 
drain well back at the very start and provide culverts to full width formation/roadway to 
avoid the need for their widening subsequently. However, road being an important part or 
rather forerunner of all development activities, stage development will become inevitable 
over a period of time and as such a decision on this issue shall be based on needs for a 
period of 15-20 years or so.
6.1.5	
The design standards indicated are absolute minimum. However, the minimum 
values shall be applied only where serious restrictions are placed by technical or economic 
considerations. General effort shall be to exceed the minimum values on safer side to the 
extent possible. Where the minimum design standards cannot be adopted for inescapable 
reasons, proper signs shall be put sufficiently in advance to inform the road users. The intention 
shall be to provide a road to the user with such geometrics which gives safe and reasonably 
comfortable travel.
6.1.6	
The standards have been classified separately for mountainous and steep terrain. 
Generally, the standards for steep terrain take lower values of design speed, radii of curve etc. 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 68
======================================================================
IRC:52-2019
18
It is likely that in many sectors, the terrain change from mountainous to steep or vice versa 
may be within short distances. It is, however, not the intention to change standards frequently. 
In practice, stretches shall be classified as mountainous or steep depending on pre-dominant 
terrain in the stretch and accordingly standards adopted for that stretch. The same standards 
shall, generally, continue for maximum distance possible/practicable. Elements of a Roadway 
(in hills and plains), classification of terrain and Road-land widths are depicted in Figs. 6.1, 6.2 
& 6.3 respectively.

Width of paved shoulders in approaches to grade separated structures shall extend on either side 
of the structures in entire length of retaining/RE wall. The retaining/RE wall on either side shall be 
abutting the paved shoulders and shall have crash barriers on top.
2.	
In case retaining wall with parapet is provided on valley side, the earthen shoulder may not be 
provided.
3.	
On horizontal curve roadway width shall be increased to provide for extra widening of curve.
4.	
Where embankment is more than 6 m high kerb with channel shall be provided at the  end 
of paved shoulder to channelize the drainage as an erosion control device in accordance with 
section 6 of IRC:SP:73-2018 and earthen shoulder shall be raised upto the level of kerb.
5.	
The roadway widths are exclusive of parapets (usual width 0.6 m) and side drains (usual width 
0.6 m) and divider medians (usual width 2.00/1.20 meter). Formation width shall include width to

6.	
On roads subject to heavy snow fall, where snow clearance is done over long periods, roadway 
width may be increased by 1.5 m. However, the requirement of such widening may be examined 
with reference to ground conditions in each case considering terrain traffic and other influencing 
conditions and factors.
7.	
In hard rock stretches or unstable locations where excessive cutting may lead to slope failure, the 
width may be reduced by 0.8 m on two lane. Where such stretches are to be provided continuously 
for long distances, passing places shall be provided.
8.	
Strategic and border roads for military/paramilitary/security forces operations/movements shall be 
constructed for not less than two lane carriageway alongwith paved shoulder on hill side + paved 
and earthen shoulder on valley side on same lines of national highway.
9.	
Wherever, divider/median is required to be provided for the cases of divided highway of all 
category roads, the minimum 1.20 meter wide divider/median shall be provided.
6.2.3	
The clear roadway width on culverts and causeways (measured from inside to inside 
of parapet walls or kerbs).
6.2.4	
For bridges, the clear width minimum between kerbs shall be 7.5 m for double lane 
bridges.
6.2.5	
In case of widening of the existing two-lane road to four-lanes, it would be desirable 
to plan a separate alignment for the additional two-lanes/split highways, in order to avoid the 
problems of stability of the existing hill slopes.
6.3	
Capacity Considerations in Hill Roads
6.3.1	
IRC:64 “Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural Areas” contains recommended 
design service volumes for hill roads also. These are given in Table 6.3.
6.3.2	
The capacity of two-lane roads can be increased by providing paved and surfaced 
shoulders at least 1.5 m width on either side. Provision of hard paved shoulders results in slow 
moving traffic being able to travel on the shoulder which reduces the interference to fast traffic 
on the main carriageway. Under these circumstances, 15 per cent increase in capacity can be 
expected, vis-à-vis, the values given in Table 6.3.

Camber/Cross Fall
6.4.1	
Generally, the pavement in straight reaches shall be provided with a crown in the 
middle and surface on either side sloping towards the edge. In case of winding alignments where

22
straight sections are few and far between, a uni-directional cross fall towards the hill side may be 
given having regard to factors such as the direction of super-elevation at the flanking horizontal 
curve, easy drainage and problem of erosion of downhill’ face etc. Typical section of road with 
camber and cross-fall is given in Fig. 6.4.
Fig. 6.4 Camber/Cross Fall
6.4.2	
Camber/cross fall on straight section shall be as follows:
a. Earth road 
-
3 to 4 per cent
(1 in 33 to 1 in 25)
b. Gravel or WBM surface 
- 
2.5 to 3 per cent 
(1 in 40 to 1 in 33)
c. Thin bituminous surfacing 
- 
2.0 to 2.5 per cent 
(1 in 50 to 1 in 40)
d. High type bituminous surfacing
-
1.7 to 2.0 per cent 
(1 in 60 to 1 in 50)
6.4.3	
For a given type of surface steeper values shall be adopted for high intensity rainfall 
area and lower values for low intensity rainfall area.
6.4.4	
Cross fall for earth shoulders shall be atleast 0.5 per cent more than the pavement 
camber subject to a minimum of 3 per cent. If the shoulders are paved, cross fall appropriate to 
the type of paved surface as given in para 6.8.2 shall be provided. On super elevated sections 
the earth portion of the shoulder on the outer side of the curve shall be provided with a reverse 
cross fall of 0.5% so that the earth does not drain on the carriage way and storm water drains 
out with minimum travel path.
6.4.5	
As the provision of cross-fall and super elevation tend to oppose each other in re-
entrants and drainage gets affected, appropriate transition and drainage arrangements shall be 
made.
6.5	
Design Speed
6.5.1	
The design speeds for various categories of hill roads are given in Table 6.4

6.5.2	
Normally, ruling design speed shall be the guiding criteria for correlating the various 
geometric standards. Minimum design speed may, however, be adopted in sections where site 
conditions including costs do not permit adoption of ruling design speed.
6.6	
Sight Distance
6.6.1	
Visibility is an important requirement for safety on roads. For this, it is necessary 
that sight distance of sufficient length is available to permit drivers enough time and distance to 
control their vehicles to avoid accident.
6.6.2	
Two types of sight distances are considered in design of hill roads. Provision of 
overtaking sight distance is, by and large, not feasible on hill roads and, therefore, this category 
of sight distance is not discussed further. However, vision berms may be provided by benching 
on hill sides, in curves to provide better sighting of vehicles wherever felt necessary. The height 
of bench may be 1.2 m from the crown of the carriageway. These are:
	
a)	
Stopping sight distance which is the clear distance ahead needed by a driver to 
bring his vehicle to a stop before meeting a stationary object in his path. It is the 
sum of braking distance at the particular speed plus the distance travelled by the 
vehicle during perception and brake reaction time.
	
b)	
Intermediate sight distance is defined as twice the stopping sight distance.
6.6.3	
Design values of both sight distances and criteria for measurement of sight distance 
are given in Tables 6.5 and 6.6 below :

6.6.4	
On hill roads, stopping sight distance is absolute minimum from safety angle and 
must be ensured regardless of any other considerations. It would be a good practice if this value 
can be exceeded and visibility corresponding to intermediate sight distance provided in as much 
length of road as possible. Advantage of intermediate sight distance is that the driver is able to 
get reasonable opportunities to overtake with caution and driving task becomes much easier.
6.6.5	
Though a third category of sight distance i.e. Overtaking Sight distance is considered 
for roads in plains, it is not normally feasible/practicable on hill roads and hence not dealt with.
6.6.6	
Application of site distance criteria for summit vertical curve design is covered in para 
6.9.4. On valley curves, the sight distance requirement is governed by night visibility which is 
discussed in para 6.9.5. Sight distance requirements at horizontal curves are dealt with in para 6.8.
6.7	
Clearance
6.7.1	
Lateral clearance
6.7.1.1	
Desirably the full roadway width at the approaches shall be carried through the 
underpass. This implies that the minimum lateral clearance (i.e. the distance between the extreme 
edge of the carriageway and the face of the nearest structure/obstruction) shall be equal to normal 
shoulder width. On lower category roads in hill areas, having comparatively narrow shoulders, it 
will be desirable to increase the roadway width at underpasses to a certain extent.
6.7.2	
Vertical clearance
6.7.2.1	
Minimum vertical clearance of 5.50 meters shall be given over the entire roadway 
at all underpasses and similarly at overhanging cliffs and semi-tunnel sections. The vertical 
clearance shall be measured from the highest point of carriageway i.e. crown or superelevated 
edge to the lowest point of overhead structures/rock out crop. Due allowance for future raising/
strengthening of pavement shall also be made.
6.7.3	
Fig. 6.5 (a) & (b) gives typical details of lateral and vertical clearance on a hill road.

Horizontal Alignment
6.8.1	
General
6.8.1.1	
The horizontal alignment shall be fluent and blend well with the surrounding topography. 
A flowing line which conforms to natural contours is aesthetically preferable to one with long 
tangents slashing through the terrain. The horizontal alignment shall be co-ordinated carefully 
with the longitudinal profile.
6.8.1.2	
Breaks in horizontal alignment at cross-drainage structures and sharp curves at the 
end of long tangents/straight sections shall be avoided, Fig. 6.6.
6.8.1.3	
Short curves give appearance of kinks, particularly for small deflection angles, and 
shall be avoided. The curves shall be sufficiently long and have suitable transitions to provide 
pleasing appearance.
Curve length shall be atleast 150 meters for a deflection angle of 5 degrees and this shall be 
increased by 30 meters for each degree decrease in the deflection angle. For deflection angles 
less than one degree, no curve is required to be designed.

6.8.1.4	
Reverse Curves may be needed in difficult terrain by very sparingly used. It shall be 
ensured that there is no overlap in the Target point of the reserve curves and there is sufficient 
length between the two curves for introduction of requisite transition curves, Fig. 6.7.
Fig. 6.7 Reverse Curve
6.8.1.5	
Curves in the same direction separated by short tangents, known as broken-back 
curves, shall be avoided as far as possible in the interest of aesthetics and safety and replaced 
by a single curve. If this is not feasible, a tangent length corresponding to 10 seconds travel time 
must atleast be ensured between the two curves, Fig. 6.8.
6.8.1.6	
Compound curves may be used in difficult topography when it is impossible to fit in a 
single circular curve and in situation where there is sudden restriction in availability of horizontal 
curve for the design speed. To ensure safe and smooth transition from one curve to the other, the 
radius of the flatter curve shall not be disproportional to the radius of the sharper curve. A ratio 
of 1.5:1 shall be considered the limiting value, Fig. 6.9.

Fig. 6.9 Compound Curve
6.8.1.7	
In general, horizontal curves shall consist of circular portion of the curve followed by 
spiral transitions on both sides. Design speed, super-elevation and coefficient of friction affect 
the design of curves. Length of transition curve is determined on the basis of rate of change of 
centrifugal acceleration or the rate of change of super-elevation.
6.8.2	
Superelevation
6.8.2.1	
Superelevation is required to be provided at horizontal curves to counter the effects 
of centrifugal force and is calculated from the formula:
2
V
e = 225R
 
	
where
	
e = superelevation in meter per meter width of roadway
	
V = speed of vehicle in KMPH and
	
R = radius of curve in meters
The above formula assumes that the centrifugal force corresponding to three-fourth of design 
speed is balanced by superelevation and one-fourth counteracted by the side friction between 
the tyres of vehicles and the road surface.
6.8.2.2	
Superelevation obtained from the above formula shall, however, be kept limited to the 
following values:
	
a)	
In snow bound areas 7%
	
b)	
In hilly areas not bound by snow 10%
6.8.2.3	
The change over from normal section to superelevated section shall be achieved over 
full length of transition curve. In case transition curve is not there or adequate length cannot be 
provided due to some reason, two-third superelevation shall be attained on the straight reach 
and balance on circular curve.
6.8.2.4	
From the drainage point of view, the superelevation shall not be less than the camber/
cross fall appropriate to the type of wearing surface. Accordingly, when the value of superelevation 



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 68
======================================================================
IRC:52-2019
28
obtained from formula in para 6.8.2.1 above is less than road camber/cross-fall, the letter may 
be continued on the curved portion without providing any superelevation.
6.8.2.5	
Superelevation at culverts in curves
The top surface of the wearing course of culverts shall have the same cross profile as the 
approaches. The superelevation may be given on the abutments keeping the deck slab thickness 
uniform as per design. The level of the top of the slab of the culverts shall be the same as the 
top level of the approaches so that any undue jerk while driving on the finished road is avoided.
6.8.2.6	
Radii beyond which no superelevation is required; Table 6.7 gives the radii of horizontal 
curves for different camber rates beyond which superelevation will not be required.

6.8.2.7	
Methods of attaining superelevation
The normal cambered section of the road is changed into superelevated section in two stages, 
First stage is the removal of adverse camber in outer half of the pavement. In the second 
stage, superelevation is gradually built up over the full width of the carriageway so that required 
superelevation is available at the beginning of the circular curve. There are three different 
methods for attaining the superelevation: (i). revolving pavement about the centre line; (ii). 
Revolving pavement about the inner edge; and (iii). revolving pavement about the outer edge. 
Plate 1 illustrates these methods diagrammatically. The small cross sections at the bottom of 
each diagram indicate the pavement cross slope condition at different points.
6.8.2.8	
Each of the above methods is applicable under different conditions. Method (i). 
which involves least distortion of the pavement will be found suitable in most of the situations 
where there are no physical controls, and may be adopted in the normal course. Method (ii). is 
preferable where the lower edge profile is a major control, e.g. on account of drainage. Where 
overall appearance is the criterion, method (iii) is preferable since the outer edge profile, which 
is most noticeable to drivers, is not distorted.
6.8.2.9	
The superelevation shall be attained gradually over the full length of the transition 
curve, so that the design superelevation is available at the starting point of the circular portion. 
Sketches in Plate 3 have been drawn on this basis. In cases where transition curve cannot, 
for some reason be provided, two-third superelevation may be attained on the straight section 
before start of the circular curve and the balance one-third on the curve.

6.8.2.10	
In developing the required superelevation, it shall be ensured that the longitudinal 
slope of the pavement edge compared to the centreline (i.e. the rate of change of superelevation) 
is not steeper than 1 In 150 for roads in plain and rolling terrain, and 1 in 60 in mountainous and 
steep terrain.
6.8.3	
Minimum curve radii
6.8.3.1	
On a horizontal curve, the centrifugal force is balanced by the combined effect of 
superelevation and side friction. Basic equation for this condition of equilibrium is as follows:
2
v
=e+f
gR
 
2
V
or
127(e+f)
 
	
where
	
v = vehicle speed in meters per second
	
V = vehicle speed in km/hr
	
g = acceleration due to gravity in meters/sec2
	
e = Superelevation in meter
	
f = Coefficient of side friction between vehicle tyre and pavement (taken as 0.15)
	
R = Radius in meters
Based on this equation and maximum permissible value of superelevation, radii for horizontal 
curves corresponding to ruling minimum and absolute minimum design speeds are given in 
Table 6.8.

6.8.4	
Transition curve
6.8.4.1	
Transition curves are necessary for a vehicle to have smooth entry from a straight 
section into a circular curve. The transition curves also improve aesthetic appearance of the road 
besides permitting gradual application of the superelevation and extra widening of carriageway 
needed at the horizontal curves. Spiral curve shall be used for this purpose.
6.8.4.2	
Minimum length of the transition curve shall be determined from the following two 
considerations and the larger of the two values adopted for design.
	
i)	
The rate of change of centrifugal acceleration shall not cause discomfort to 
drivers. From this consideration, the length of transition curve is given by:
 
	
where
	
Ls = length of transition in meters
	
V = speed in km/h
	
R = radius of circular curve in meters
	
C = 80/(75+V)(subject to a maximum of 0.8 and minimum of 0.5) 
	
ii)	
The rate of change of superelevation (i.e. the longitudinal grade developed at the 
pavement edge compared to through grade along the centre line) shall be such 
as not to cause discomfort to travelers or to make the road appear unsightly. The 
formulae for minimum length of transition on this basis are:
	
For Plain and Rolling Terrain:
 
	
For Mountainous and Steep Terrain:
6.8.4.3	
Having regard to the above considerations, the minimum transition lengths for different 
speeds and curve radii are given in Table 6.9.
6.8.4.4	
The elements of a combined circular and transition curve are illustrated in Fig. 6.10. 
For deriving values of the individual elements like shift, tangent distance, apex distance, etc. and 
working out coordinates to lay the curves in the field, it is convenient to use curve tables. For this, 
reference may be made to IRC:38 “Guidelines for Design of Horizontal Curves for Highways and 
Design Tables”.

6.8.5	
Widening at curves
6.8.5.1	
At sharp horizontal curves, it Is necessary to widen the carriageway to facilitate safe 
passage of vehicles. The widening has two components i.e. Mechanical widening to compensate 
the extra width occupied by the vehicle due to tracking of rear wheels and Psychological widening 
to permit easy crossing of vehicles, since vehicles tend to wander more on curve. Both the 
components are to be taken care of in double lane and mechanical components on single lane 
roads. However, at blind curves double-laning may be considered.
6.8.5.2	
Extra width to be provided on horizontal curves is given in Table 6.10.

6.8.5.3	
Extra width shall be given by increasing the width at uniform rate along transition 
curve and full width given along circular curve. Entire widening shall preferably be provided on 
inside of the curve. The extra widening may be attained by means of offsets radial to the centre 
line. It shall be ensured that the pavement edge lines are smooth and there is no apparent kink.
6.8.6	
Set-back distance at horizontal curves
6.8.6.1	
Requisite sight distance shall be available to sight the inside of horizontal curves. 
Lack of visibility in the lateral direction may arise due to obstructions like walls, cut slopes, 
wooded areas, high crops, etc. Set-back distance from the centre line of the carriageway, within 
which offending obstructions shall be cleared, to ensure the needed visibility, can be determined 
as given in para 6.8.6.2. However, in certain cases, due to variations in alignment, road cross-
section and the type and location of obstructions, it may become necessary to resort to field 
measurements to fix the exact limits of clearance.
6.8.6.2	
The set-back-distance is calculated from the following equation (see Fig. 6.11 for 
definitions):
m = R-(R-n) Cos θ
	
where = 
 
 
      
  radians;
	
m =	 the minimum set-back distance to sight obstruction in meters (measured from 
the centre line of the road); 
	
R =	 radius at centre line of the road in meters
	
n =	 distance between the centre line of the road and the centre line of the inside 
lane in meters; and
	
S =	 sight distance in meters



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 68
======================================================================

IRC:52-2019
33
In the above equation, sight distance is measured along the middle or inner lane. On single-lane 
roads, sight distance is measured along centre line of the road and ‘n’ is taken as zero.
Fig. 6.11 Visibility at Horizontal Curves
	
R –	 RADIUS OF CURVE
	
S –	 SIGHT DISTANCE
	
m –	 MINIMUM SET-BACK DISTANCE
	
n –	 DISTANCE BETWEEN CENTRE LINE OF CARRIAGEWAY AND CENTRE 
LINE OF INSIDE LANE
6.8.6.3	
Utilising the above equation, the design values for set-back distance corresponding to 
safe stopping distance for single lane carriageway are given in Table 6.11. These design values 
relate basically to circular curves longer than the design sight distance. For shorter curves, the 
values of set-back distance given in Table 6.11 will be somewhat on the higher side, but these 
can, however, be used as a guide. Lateral clearances for two lane carriageway can be computed 
similarly from the above equation.

Lateral clearance for intermediate sight distance can be computed similarly but the 
set-back required is usually too large to be economically feasible in the case of hill roads.
6.8.6.5	
Where there is a cut slope on the inside of the horizontal curve, the average height 
of sight line can be used as an approximation for deciding the extent of clearance. For stopping 
sight distance, this may be taken as 0.7 m. Cut slopes shall be kept lower than this height at the 
line demarcating the set-back distance envelope, either by cutting back the slope or benching 
suitably, Fig. 6.12. Such a provision is also generally known as better benching or vision berms.
Fig. 6.12 Vision of Berms
6.8.7	
Blind curves
6.8.7.1	
Blind curves are those on which sight distance available is less than the safe stopping 
sight distance i.e. absolute minimum from safety point of view. While clearance of obstructions 
within the minimum set-back distance is expected to ensure the minimum sight distance required

as per standards, in hill roads it may not always be possible to ensure this due to terrain conditions. 
In such cases certain curves will have sight distance less than minimum as per standards and 
hence blind.
6.8.7.2	
In a blind curve there is always the danger of a vehicle not being able to come to a 
stop before reaching danger point or a vehicle coming from the opposite direction which is likely 
to collide with it, due to lack of adequate sight distance. The remedy for this problem, to ensure 
better traffic safety, may be provided as under:
	
a)	
better benching or vision berms (Para 6.8.6.5 & Fig. 6.12 refers) in a more 
liberal manner as required on ground by survey.
	
b) 	
making the road two - lane width in the stretch and providing lane dividers in the 
form of central studs or medians etc.
	
c) 	
restriction of traffic to one way at a time in the stretch, if otherwise practicable.
6.8.7.3	
It has to be ensured at blind curves are accepted only where it is un-avoidable and 
that also rarely in any stretch of road since trafficability and safety of a hill road is considerably 
reduced by blind curves.
6.8.8	
Measurement of radius of an existing curve at site
6.8.8.1	
It is often necessary to know radius of an existing curve on a hill road to plan 
improvements etc. As it may not always be possible to reach the centre of curve, an indirect 
method may have to be adopted.
A simple method is given in Fig. 6.13.
Fig. 6.13 At site Measurement of Radius of Existing Curve
	
Measure any chord AB and offset DC
	
Now AD x DB = CD x DE
	
(1/2 chord)2 = offset x (2R - offset)

Vertical Alignment

General
6.9.1.1	
Broken-back grade lines, i.e. two vertical curves in the same direction separated by 
a short tangent, shall be avoided due to poor appearance, and preferably replaced by a single 
curve.
6.9.1.2	
Decks of small cross-drainage structures (i.e. culverts and minor bridges) shall follow 
the same profile as the flanking road section, with no break in the grade line.
6.9.1.3	
Recommended gradients for different terrain conditions, except at hair-pin bends, are 
given in Table 6.12.
Table 6.12 Recommended Gradients for Different Terrain Conditions

Terrain more than 3000 m above MSL

7% (1 in 14.3)
Exceptional
7% (1 in 14.3)
8% (1 in 12.5)
6.9.1.4	
Gradients up to the ‘ruling gradient’ may be used as a matter of course in design.
6.9.1.5	
The ‘limiting gradients’ may be used where the topography of a place compels this 
course or where the adoption of gentler gradients would add enormously to the cost. In such 
cases, the length of continuous grade steeper than the ruling gradient shall be as short as 
possible.
6.9.1.6	
‘Exceptional gradients’ are meant to be adopted only in very difficult situations and for 
short lengths not exceeding 100 m at a stretch. Successive stretches of exceptional gradients 
must be separated by a minimum length of 100 m having gentler/flatter gradient.
6.9.1.7	
The cumulative rise/fall in elevation over 2 km length shall not exceed 100 m in 
mountainous terrain and 120 m in steep terrain.
6.9.1.8	
Escape lane: Where long, continuous descending grades exist or where topographic 
and location controls require such grades on new alignment for a length of 2 kms or more, 
the design and construction of an emergency escape ramp at an appropriate location with an 
interval of about 2 kms is desirable for the purpose of slowing and stopping an out-of-control 
vehicle away from the main traffic stream. These lanes may be useful in bringing the vehicles to 
halt in case of emergency due to brake failure. The lanes are constructed with reverse gradients 
to provide deceleration of vehicles with arrester bed suitably located. Specific guidelines for the 
design of escape lanes are lacking at this time. However, guiding principle for design and layout 
of escape lane as per AASHTO practice is appended (Appendix-3).

6.9.1.9	
Climbing lane: Restricted overtaking opportunities and the presence of slow moving 
vehicles can result in substantial congestion and high accident rates through injudicious 
overtaking. Congestion effects are greatest on long steep gradients. The situation is particularly 
difficult in India because of the presence of overloaded trucks and buses with very low power-to-
weight ratios.
In such circumstances, the provision of an auxiliary climbing lane can be extremely beneficial to 
enable vehicles travelling up the gradient to overtake safety and efficiently.
Thus climbing lanes may be provided wherever necessary in order to address the necessity 
of making available a separate lane for safe overtaking for vehicle travelling uphill, in reaches 
having continuous exceptional gradients.
Clear signing, road marking and in some cases, physical barriers are needed to ensure that the 
absolute right of way of climbing vehicles is safely upheld.
6.9.2	
Grade compensation at curves
6.9.2.1	
At horizontal curves, the gradients shall be eased by an amount known as ‘grade 
compensation’ which is intended to offset the extra tractive effort involved at curves. This is 
calculated by the following formula:
Grade compensation (per cent) =     
 
 
subject to maximum of 75/R where R is radius of the curve in meters. Since grade compensation 
is not necessary for gradients flatter than 4 per cent, when applying grade compensation 
correction, the gradients need not be eased beyond 4 per cent.
6.9.3	
Vertical curve
6.9.3.1	
Vertical curves are introduced for smooth transition at grade changes. Convex vertical 
curves are known as summit curves and concave vertical curves as valley or sag curves. Both 
these shall be designed as square parabolas.
6.9.3.2	
The length of the vertical curve is controlled by sight distance requirements, but curves 
with greater length are aesthetically better.
6.9.3.3	
Curves shall be provided at all grade change exceeding those indicated in Table 6.13. 
For satisfactory appearance, the minimum length shall be as shown in the Table.

the pavement. Where a number of hair-pin bends have to be introduced, a minimum intervening 
distance of 60 m shall be provided between the successive bends to enable the driver to negotiate 
the alignment smoothly.

6.10.3	
Widening of hair-pin bends subsequently is a difficult and costly process. Moreover, 
gradients tend to become sharper as generally widening can be achieved only by cutting the hill 
side. These points shall be kept in view at the planning stage, especially if a series of hair-pin 
bends are involved.
6.10.4	
At hair-pin bends, preferably, the full roadway width shall be surfaced.
6.10.5	
A cross drainage to be provided 20 m before the start of the hair-pin bend for proper 
drainage of surface water. Similarly adequate drainage may also be provided on the hill side of 
the bend so that water does not cross over it. Plate 5
6.11	
Passing Places (Fig. 6.17)
Fig. 6.17 Passing Places ODR & VR
6.11.1	
Passing places are required on single lane hill roads to facilitate crossing of vehicles 
approaching from the opposite direction and to tow aside a disabled vehicle so that it does not 
obstruct traffic. They shall be provided at the rate of 2-3 per kilometer.
6.11.2	
Normal size of passing place is 3.75 m wide, 30 m long on inside edge and 20 m long 
on the farther side. The exact location of passing places shall be judiciously determined taking 
into consideration the available extra width and visibility.
6.12	
Co-ordination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignments
6.12.1	
The overall appearance of a highway can be enhanced considerably by judicious 
combination of the horizontal and vertical alignments. Plan and profile of the road shall not 
be designed independently but in unison so as to produce an appropriate three dimensional 
effect. Proper co-ordination in this respect will ensure safety, improve utility of the highway and 
contribute to overall aesthetics.
6.12.2	
Vertical curvature superimposed upon horizontal curvature gives a pleasing effect. 
As such the vertical and horizontal curves shall coincide as far as possible and their length shall 
be more or less equal. If this is difficult for any reason, the horizontal curve shall be somewhat 
longer than the vertical curve.

slag vertical curves from safety point of view.

7 TUNNELS
Tunnels become economical and, therefore, necessary while developing an alignment for hill 
road passing through high ground. Tunnels are also constructed under a river or waterway, 
mostly in an urban area. For detailed planning and design, IRC:SP:91 be referred. However, 
preliminary steps for tunnel planning are as follows:
7.1	
Surveys
Topographical survey helps in identifying land features and for selecting the most suitable 
tunnel alignment. Traverse network connecting the existing survey control on each side of the 
hill to a high degree of accuracy is necessary for establishing the ground control for the tunnel 
alignment.
7.2	
Accuracy
Director, Geodetic and Research Branch, Survey of India have issued technical instructions 
regarding horizontal control survey for tunnels, where it is stated that an accuracy of 1:30,000 
for outer horizontal control should be aimed at.
7.3	
Mapping
The mapping around both the proposed portal locations shall be conducted by EDM survey 
for maintaining the desired accuracy. Sufficient area around both the portal locations shall 
be covered on a scale of 1:1000 with a contour interval of 1 m to have a better appreciation 
of the topography around the portal location for planning the suitable geometry of the tunnel 
alignment and location of portals, bore hole locations and other permanent structures. 
Proposed tunnel alignment shall also be marked on the contour plans prepared around both 
portal locations.
7.4	
Ideal Tunnel Portal Layout
The important criteria for locating the portal are the existence of sound rock conditions with 
adequate cover. The rock mass should be free from any fault/dislocation and the loose fractured 
zones/layers should not be sloping towards the portals. Further, the location of a portal should be 
such that it is not affected by landslides ensuring the approaches to the portal in stable formation 
requiring least open cut excavation/ground stabilization measures.

Conclusion
7.7	
Design Standards
	
(i)	
Alignment in plan: A road tunnel should, ideally be straight in plan. This 
is seldom possible, but the introduction of sharp curves, particularly in 
conjunction with steep gradients should be avoided, even if it means a 
longer tunnel. If horizontal curves become unavoidable, a minimum radius 
of 200 m could be adopted. Only in exceptional cases, this should be 
reduced to 100 m.
	
(ii)	
Gradients: The gradients of the roadway are of primary importance, since 
in most cases they constitute a determining factor in the length of tunnel, 
and hence its cost. In general, it is sought to employ gradients which 
will not cause congestion through the excessive slowing down of heavy 
vehicles.
	
(iii)	 Cross-section of tunnel: The internal cross-sectional dimensions of a road 
tunnel are determined by the following considerations:
	
(a)	 the number and width of traffic lanes making up the carriageway;
	
(b)	 the vertical headroom for vehicles;
	
(c)	
the space to be provided for ventilation ducts, walkways, lighting, and 
drainage and for fire and other services.
	
	
Long tunnels should have a good longitudinal gradient for effective drainage, 0.2 
per cent is satisfactory. Long tunnels, which are more than 300 m length, should 
not have a gradient steeper than 4 per cent. With tunnels less than 300 m long, 
a straight fall should be adopted. However, two outward falling gradient are 
permitted for a tunnel over 300 m long.
	
(iv)	 Ventilation: Ventilation is one of the most important factors in the design of road 
tunnels. There are two main requirements:



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 68
======================================================================

IRC:52-2019
45
	
(1)	 A sufficient volume of fresh air must be supplied to all parts of the traffic 
space to dilute the carbon monoxide from motor exhausts to a biologically 
safe level.
	
(2)	 A good standard of visibility must be maintained in the tunnel for the safety 
and comfort of drivers.
	
	
Road vehicles passing through a tunnel emit fumes, which need to be cleared 
quickly. Artificial ventilation becomes necessary in tunnels above 400 m length. 
The ventilation system should be capable of producing a fresh air input of 0.5 
cum per meter length of the tunnel. The speed of air is generally limited to 5 m 
per second.
	
(v)	
Illumination: The lighting of tunnels calls for special consideration. The driver 
entering a tunnel should be able to adjust himself to the artificial lighting conditions 
inside the tunnel. Similarly, the driver leaving a tunnel should be able to adjust 
himself to the natural light outside the tunnel. For achieving these requirements, 
the tunnel is divided into zones of different lighting intensities.

Appendix-3
GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF PROVIDING ESCAPE LANE
Highway alignment, gradient, length and descent speed contributes to the potential for out 
of control vehicles. Accident experience and vehicle operations (usually truck) on the grade 
combined with engineering judgment are frequently used as the determinant for an escape 
ramp. Escape lanes may be built at any feasible location where the main road alignment is in 
transition. They should be built in advance of main lane curvature that cannot be negotiated 
safely by an out of control vehicle and in advance of populated areas. Escape lanes should 
exit to be left side of the main line. For new and existing facilities and until local criteria are 
available it may be useful to adopt the AASHTO criteria. The most commonly used escape 
ramp is the ascending type with an arrester bed, Fig. A.2.1. Ramp installations of ascending 
type use gradient resistance to advantage, supplementing the effects of the aggregate in the 
arrester bed, and generally reducing the length of ramp necessary to stop the vehicle. The 
loose bedding material in arrester bed increases the rolling resistance and bedding serves 
to hold the vehicle in place on the ramp grade it has came to stop. Escape ramp should be 
designed for speed range of 50 to 120 km per hour. The design of escape lane should consider 
the following criteria:
Fig. A.2.1 Typical Type of Emergency Escape Ramp
	
-	
Safety stop an out-of-control vehicle and the length of ramp must be sufficient to 
dissipate the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle.
	
-	
Alignment of escape ramp should be tangent or be very flat curvature to relieve 
the driver of undue vehicle control problems.
	
-	
Width of ramp should be adequate to accommodate more than one vehicle 
because it is not uncommon for two or more vehicles to have need of the escape

ramp within a short time. 9 to 12 m width would more safely accommodate 
two-or more out of control vehicles. Widths of ramps in use range from 3.6 m to 
12 m.
	
-	
Surfacing material used in arrester bed should be clean, easily compacted and 
have high coefficient of rolling resistance. Layout of arrester bed adjacent to 
carriageway is shown in Fig. A.2.2.
	
-	
Entrance to the ramp must be designed so that vehicle traveling at a high rate of 
speed can enter safely.
	
-	
Advance sign is required to inform the driver about the existence of the escape 
ramp well in advance so that a decision whether or not to use the ramp may be 
taken. Regulatory sign near the entrance should be used to discourage other 
motorists from entering, stopping or parking at the ramp. Proper illumination of 
the approach is desirable.
	
-	
The characteristic that makes a truck escape ramp an effective safety device 
also makes it difficult to retrieve a vehicle captured by the ramp. Ideally a service 
road located adjacent to arrester bed is needed so that recovery vehicle and 
maintenance vehicles can use it without becoming trapped in the material. Width 
of service lane should be at least 3 m (desirable).
