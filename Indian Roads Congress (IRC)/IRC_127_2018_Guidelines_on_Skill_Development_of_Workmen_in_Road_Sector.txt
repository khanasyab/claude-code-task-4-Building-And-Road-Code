GUIDELINES ON SKILL DEVELOPMENT OF WORKMEN  IN  ROAD SECTOR
Introduction
Developed infrastructure provides strong backbone for sustainable socio-economic 
development of a nation and highways being the most important infrastructure sector, forms the 
arteries of economic development. India is one of the fastest developing economies of the world. 
It has second largest road network in the world. Traditionally, allocation for Road Sector, among 
the ten subheads in Government of India’s five Year Plans, is the second highest, next only to 
Electricity and Power and has been varying around 15-17 percent of the total investments in the 
Infrastructure Sector.
Construction Industry is the third largest employer in India after agriculture and manufacturing.  It 
employs more than 5.6 crore workers. Highway Sector is highly process oriented. For adhering 
to the specified processes, trained and skilled manpower is essential not only at managerial and 
supervisory level but also at the cutting edge level of workmen and technicians.
With huge planned investments in Roads and Bridges, even a marginal increase in skill 
level is expected to yield improved output and quality of the roads leading to savings in 
initial cost, maintenance costs, safety and fuel efficiency. However, the low skills of the 
construction workers lead to lower productivity and poor quality of output. A need was felt 
by the Human Resource Development Committee (G-2) to prepare a document dealing 
with skill development of workmen in road sector. Accordingly, the task was taken up by 
G-2 Committee in 2012-2014 tenure. The initial draft was prepared by Shri K.B. Rajoria, 
Shri K.N. Aggrawal, Shri O.P. Goel, Shri D.P. Gupta, Shri S.K. Vij and Shri O.P. Shrivastava. In 
the year 2015, the G-2 Committee was reconstituted and  the task was assigned to Shri Shishir 
Bansal and Shri H.K. Srivastava to review and modify the document in line with MoRTH/Govt. of 
India policies. The  document was  discussed by the G-2 Committee in a number of meetings.
The  G-2 Committee (personnel given below) in its 9th meeting held on 17.02.2017 finalized 
the document and recommended its submission to the General Specifications & Standards 
Committee (GSS) for its consideration. The GSS Committee in its meeting held on 24th June, 
2017 after deliberations, referred the document to Sub-Group of GSS Committee constituted 
under chairmanship of Maj. V.C. Verma comprising Director, IAHE, Shri K. B. Rajoria, 
Convenor, G-2 Committee, CE, S,R&T (R), MoRTH; Shri Kaushik Basu, CE, Morth & 
Ms Neha Vyas, Senior Environmental Specialist, World Bank to look into matter and reframe 
the document covering discussed aspects while keeping harmony  with  MSDE policy on skill 
development. The document was discussed in a number of meetings by Sub-Group and the 
Sub-Group in its meeting held on 19.01.2018 finalized the draft document for onward submission 
to GSS Committee.  The document was approved by the GSS Committee in its meeting held 
on 25.04.2018 and thereafter by the Council in its 215th meeting held on 4th May, 2018 at Aizawl 
(Mizoram). The observations of the Council were reviewed and draft modified accordingly for 
publishing. Shri H.K. Srivastava, Member, G-2 Committee did outstanding work for finalizing the 
draft. His contribution is highly appreciated.
The list of personnel of G-2 Committee is as under:

Chapter 1 gives details of development of Transport Sector during post Independence period. 
There has been phenomenal development in road sector, particularly for National Highways and 
Rural Roads. “Road Development Plan Vision 2021” document lays stress on creating training 
cells. Chapter 2 deals with statutory skill level of workmen giving details of employment from year 
1995 onwards. Issues related with skill development have also been enumerated.
Chapter 3 gives details of initiatives taken by Government for skill development up to 11th Five 
Year Plan. Different institutions of Government took initiative to conceptualize issues related to Skill 
Development of Workmen. Chapter 4 deals with further initiatives by Government wherein whole 
concept was reviewed and units created to work for skill development after National Policy for Skill 
Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 was announced by the Government and a separate Skill 
Development Ministry was formed by Government of India. Chapter 5 gives some of the policies 
encouraging the skilling mission and incentives available. 
Chapter 6 gives details of field of activities in Road Sector and various categories of Workmen 
to be covered, have been brought out. List of courses already developed has also been given. In 
Chapter 7, provision regarding skill development in contract document of different organizations 
have been brought out. Chapter 8 gives details of existing training facilities.
Chapter 9 covers critical review of apprenticeship act provision for construction sector bringing 
out modifications required. Chapter 10 describes comprehensive details for building capabilities 
for training of workmen. Construction is different from industry and building capability for skill 
development in this sector is possible by associating contractors and imparting training at project 
sites. Chapter 11 deals with a specific category of Laboratory Technicians, just to demonstrate 
that for different categories, different approach is required. Chapter 12 deals with training of 
trainers. Chapter 13 gives the way ahead to ensure success of skill development initiatives.

CHAPTER 1 
Transport Sector in the Post- Independence period
1.1	
Before independence, the transport system consisting of mainly railways and roads, 
was developed primarily to provide communications with the major ports and larger cities. The 
focus changed after independence for rebuilding the transport network and making it responsive 
to the development needs of the economy. Not only were the rail and road network expanded but 
efforts were made to develop other modes of transport such as shipping, ports, air, inland water 
transport, etc. A portion of the proposed investment was set apart to promote transport in the 
remote and backward regions of the country with a view to opening them to the growth process.
1.2	
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was established as a statutory entity 
under NHAI Act, 1988. However, it was operationalized in February, 1995 with the appointment 
of a full time Chairman. NHAI’s initial mandate in 1996 was a few projects undertaken with the 
assistance of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan Bank for International Cooperation 
(JBIC). Subsequently, in 1998, the Govt. of India announced the major initiatives of up-gradation 
and strengthening of the National Highways through the National Highways Development Project 
(NHDP) comprising mainly the four lane Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) linking the four metros and 
connectivity to major ports in the first phase and North-South and East-West corridors in the 
second phase. Later on the scope was extended into 7 phases as below: 
	
i)	
The Golden Quadrilateral Corridor comprising a total length of 5,846 km. The 
entire stretch is complete. 
	
ii)	
NS & EW Corridors – Phase I & Phase II of NHDP comprising 4 laning of 7,142 
km.
	
iii)	
NHDP Phase III for 4 laning of existing National Highways comprising 
12,109 km not covered under GQ and NS & EW Corridors. 
	
iv)	
Under NHDP Phase IV, 2 laning of 14,799 km with paved shoulders has been 
approved.
	
v)	
Six laning of the Golden Quadrilateral and a few other selected stretches are 
covered in NHDP Phase V covering 6500 km. 
	
vi)	
NHDP Phase VI covers development of 1000 km of expressways. 
	
vii)	
NHDP VII covers development of ring roads, bypasses, grade separators 
and service roads etc. in a length of about 700 km. The estimated cost is 
Rs. 15,000 cr. 
Thus, about 48,096 km of roads have been approved under NHDP. As on 31st March, 2018 
about 25,641 kms have been completed. Though several reasons are attributed to this shortfall, 
one reason for poor performance of contractors could easily be attributed to non-deployment of 
skilled work force. 
1.3	
Rural Roads comprise over 80 percent of the road network. Their being kept in 
serviceable condition is crucial to agricultural growth and to provide access to crores of rural people 
to social and economic facilities. The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) launched the Pradhan 
Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) on 25th December, 2000 to connect with all-weather 
roads, all the habitations with population of 500 and more (250 in hilly, desert and tribal areas)

in first instance. The programme is funded through Central Road Fund (CRF), borrowing from 
multilateral agencies and budgetary support of the Centre and the States. The PMGSY also covers 
upgradation of existing roads serving to the targeted habitation. The PMGSY targets include 
new connectivity to about 1,67,000 habitations involving construction of about 3,65,000 km 
of roads apart from upgrading about 3,73,000 km of existing rural roads to the prescribed 
standards. The rural roads constructed under PMGSY will be maintained by concerned State 
Government. As on 11th June, 2018, 6,27,212 km of road has been constructed or upgraded 
under the PMGSY. In addition, a new intervention as PMGSY II has been launched in 
August, 2013. It aims to consolidate existing Rural Road Network by upgradation of existing 
selected rural roads on their economic potential and their role in facilitating the growth of rural 
market centres and rural hubs. It also aims to act as a catalyst for livelihood based programmes 
including Aajeevika launched during the 12th Five Year Plan. Similarly, the States have been 
undertaking development of State Highways (SH), Major District Roads (MDR)  and Non-PMGSY 
rural roads. Upgradation and Capacity Augmentation of Roads and Bridges is also receiving 
increasing attention of Urban Local Boards and State Governments. All this underline the need 
for skill development of workmen in the road construction sector.
1.4	
The Vision Document (Road Development Plan Vision 2021) covers the period from 
2001 to 2021. It aims, among other things, at formulating appropriate training policy for Highway 
engineers to keep pace with technological developments the world over. It lays stress on creation 
of training cells in each of the engineering organizations to constantly evaluate the performance 
of the training programme and identify Officers to be trained and their training needs. NITHE 
(now IAHE) under Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) is designated to play a lead 
role with support from Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), National Institute of Construction 
Management and Research (NICMAR) and State Level Training Centers. Making use of Academic 
and Management Institutions for specialized courses has also been recommended. The Vision 
Document also recognizes the criticality of training of the cutting-edge-level of technicians and 
equipment operators. It envisages lead by the equipment industry and setting up of training 
centers in different regions. Documentation on review/ current status is not readily available.

Chapter 2
status of skill level OF WORKMEN
2.1	
Generally five categories of workmen are identified. These are (i) Workmen 
employed by Government, (ii) Workmen employed by Construction Agencies, (iii) Casual 
Labour (sitting on Labour chowks or mandis), (iv) Unemployed Youth in Urban areas and 
(v) Unemployed Youth in Rural areas.
2.2	
An estimation of workers engaged in the construction sector, according to the Report 
of the Working Group on Construction, constituted by the Planning Commission (now Niti Aayog) 
is as follows (Table 2.1):

It would be seen that there is significant increase in proportion of unskilled workers. Their 
number is well above 34 million. Such a huge number of unskilled workers is an indicator of 
the status wherein efforts are required on the part of all concerned towards remedying the 
worsening situation. It also indicates that there is a huge scarcity of skilled workers and practice 
of certification as empowerment criteria is practically missing. Even for operating a number 
of heavy equipment, no driving license is required not even for a Road Roller. The concept of 
skill development and certification of trained and qualified personnel below a diploma holder 
Junior Engineer is virtually absent. The objective of the skill development is to create a work 
force empowered with the necessary and continuously upgraded skills, knowledge and an 
internationally recognized qualification/certification to gain access to decent employment and 
ensure India’s competitiveness in the dynamic global market. It also aims at increasing the 
productivity and employability of work force both in organized and in unorganized sectors, 
adopted to changing technologies and labour market demands.                                                                                                                     
2.3	
Personnel employed as Engineers and at Sub-Graduate level could be considered to 
belong to the organized sector. Persons in the supervisory capacity positions and as workers fall 
largely into unorganized sector. It would be seen that the largest segment of industry remains 
employed in unorganized sector in spite of several ongoing initiatives to instill good practices. 
This has a profound effect on the overall performance and quality of delivery of the end product, 
since performance of even those in the organized sector remains largely dependent on those 
in unorganized sector. The key focus therefore needs to be on building capabilities of the

construction industry to deliver the desired results and to cope with the envisaged work plans 
and deliver the infrastructure projects on time and with quality. Lack of this potential would 
mean additional cost, lack of durability and substantial reduction in our competitive position with 
respect to international players.
2.4	
The construction industry by nature is dynamic and project oriented. Therefore, it 
cannot be handled in a typical assembly line manner as the manufacturing industry functions. 
The peculiarities and issues of construction industry have to be considered before deciding 
on the methodology and engagement for apprentices. This would equally help the road sector 
construction workers. The major issues are detailed as follows :- 
	
a)	
The requirement, demand and employment is sector and project oriented and 
not as a common standard in manufacturing sector.
	
b)	
Mostly, the duration of engagement is short, varying from one to three years with 
exceptions in few cases.
	
c)	
Projects have difficult climatic, operational, boarding and lodging conditions.
	
d)	
There are mass requirements in a few selected trades but of shorter durations 
and in spurts.
	
e)	
Around ninety percent employment is either contractual or work output/ 
measurement basis leaving a small window for salaried employment.
	
f)	
The payments or salaries are not as per scale or standards across the industry 
but are based on the requirements, output and level of skills acquired.
	
g)	
Mobility and turnover of manpower is fast, varying between three months for 
workmen class to a few years for Supervisors and Engineers.
	
h)	
The majority skill workers requirement that is 75% to 80% is restricted to a few 
Job roles/ trades only, in any typical project of Real Estate, Power Plant, Road, 
Bridge etc. 
	
i)	
Foremen and Supervisors at higher levels that is Level 5 & 6 are supposed to 
have multi-trade exposure unlike manufacturing sector.
	
j)	
Moving up in the promotion pyramid shall require additional skills of leadership 
and management in handling large group of labour force in addition to material 
and logistic planning.

InitiativeS for skill development upto 11th five year plan  
(March 2012)
3.1	
In the 1950s and 60s, Govt. of India focused on setting up heavy industries through 
Public Sector Units. This created demand for skilled manpower at various levels. Thus ITIs, 
Polytechnics and Engineering Colleges including IITs and NITs were set up across the country. 
Technical institutions especially at the lower levels were oriented towards the organized 
manufacturing and capital goods industry. These ITIs and Polytechnics have been meeting the 
requirement of our industry quite effectively. However, with changing pattern of requirements, 
the employment demand has also changed. The demand is more from unorganized sector due 
to infrastructure development. There is a shift in employment pattern of traditional trades from 
permanency to short term which is more project oriented and entrepreneurial in nature.
3.2	
The Apprenticeship Act, 1961 was enacted at that time keeping in mind the 
requirements of skilled manpower for manufacturing industry. The Act has undergone reviews in 
1973 and 1986 to bring Graduates, Technicians and Diploma holders under its ambit but mainly 
it still remained focused towards the manufacturing industry. Therefore, there is a need to have a 
relook so as to bring the Construction Sector Trades within this Act which can ultimately address 
the Infrastructural requirements and open up larger employment opportunities for the masses.
3.3	
Skill Development Mission was launched during the Eleventh Plan period 
(2007-12) to impart skills to at least 50 million individuals in the engineering and non-engineering 
sectors by the end of the 12th Plan (2012-2017). It has been recognized that to ensure that 
skills match demand, special efforts are needed to ensure that employees and enterprises play 
an integral role in the conception and implementation of such training programmes, including 
managing Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and in the development of faculty. An enabling 
frame work is on the anvil that would attract private investment in such training schemes 
through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Mobilization of investment, setting up of ITIs to 
international standards, ensuring efficiency in operations and management and enabling post 
training empowerment will be primary responsibility of the private sector. The envisaged role of 
the Government would be to provide the enabling frame work and requisite financing especially 
in respect of weaker sections of the society.
3.4	
National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) provides for following key elements:
	
a)	
National principles for recognizing skill proficiency and competencies at different 
levels leading to international equivalency.
	
b)	
Multiple entry and exit between vocational education, skill training, general 
education, technical education and job markets.
	
c)	
Progression path ways defined within skill qualification framework. 
	
d)	
Opportunities to promote lifelong learning and skill development.
	
e)	
Partnership with industry/employers.
	
f)	
Transparent, accountable and credible mechanism for skill development across 
various sectors.
	
g)	
Increased potential for Recognition of Prior Learning.

3.5	
In our country, there are 18 Ministries (shortlisted by the Planning Commission) 
which, in one way or other, are linked up with workers, their skill development and their welfare. 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is one of them. The Highway Development is mainly 
assigned to 3 Agencies, i.e., National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), State Governments 
and the National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) for PMGSY. The Border Roads 
Organization (BRO) is also entrusted with National Highways in a few areas. National Highways 
Authority of India is engaged in development, maintenance and management of National 
Highways(NH) entrusted to it. State Governments are responsible for the Highways and Roads 
(NH, SH, MDR, ODRs) in their States running within the State boundaries. The NRRDA, through 
State Government Agencies, is responsible for the development of Rural Roads under PMGSY. 
Development and management of urban roads is carried out by the respective State Government 
or the Municipal Bodies/Cantonment Boards.
3.6	
Recognizing that skill gap needs to be addressed through comprehensive efforts at 
various levels and catering to different needs of the society and the industry, the Government 
of India adopted skill development as a national priority. The Eleventh Five Year Plan detailed 
a road map for skill development and favored the formation of Skill Development Missions, 
both at State and National Levels. A three-tier institutional structure consisting of the Prime 
Minister’s National Council on Skill Development (PMNCSD), the National Skill Development 
Co-ordination Board (NSDCB) and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) was 
created in the year 2008. Thus, the three-tier structure was created to facilitate implementation 
of skill development through three main channels- Central Ministries, the State Governments 
and private/public training organizations. The main functions of the PMNCSD were outlined as 
follows:
	
a)	
Develop a strategy for skill development at the national level, along with variations 
at the State Level.
	
b)	
Map the gaps in the area of skill development and develop strategies to address 
the skill deficit.
	
c)	
Identify new areas for employability and promote skill development in such 
sectors.
	
d)	
Advise on remodeling of existing skill development programme run by various 
Ministries.
	
e)	
Promote greater use of Information Communications Technology in the area of 
skill development.
	
f)	
Develop and implement an action plan for skill development to maximize job 
generation within the country and create human resources for global needs.
	
g)	
Provide guidance through PM’s National Council on Skill Development for 
activities to be undertaken by the Centre and the States and by the National 
Skill Development Corporation.
3.7	
The National Skill Development Policy, 2009 recognized the need for National 
Qualification Framework (NQF) in our country that would stimulate and support reforms in skill 
development and facilitate establishment of nationally standardized and acceptable, International 
comparable qualifications. According to a publication ‘To The People’ brought out by National 
Skill Development Agency in August, 2013, various points came across, during an India-EU 
Conference held in May, 2013 as the rationale for a unified skill qualification framework. This 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
9
should serve a useful purpose for strategy developers including those in road sector. These 
points are given below:
	
a)	
National Qualification Framework (NQF) are often seen as a solution to many 
problems in the education and training systems in a country. However, it has to 
be noted that developing an NQF alone is not sufficient. In fact, many countries 
with NQF have realized that many other supporting things were required for 
ensuring that problems do not arise.
	
b)	
It takes time to develop an NQF and once developed, it also evolves. So it is not 
an overnight improvement/solution.
	
c)	
Coordination/cooperation from various bodies is required – regulators, training 
providers, employers, Government Bodies, Curriculum Developers etc.
	
d)	
Success of NQF depended on whether employers were using these frameworks 
for hiring decisions. It would truly work only when evidence suggests that 
investment in education and training was actually reaping returns in some 
tangible form – for the industry as well as the workers.
3.8	
Need for Skill Development Initiative Scheme (SDIS) – A majority of Indian 
workforce does not possess marketable skills, which is an impediment in getting decent 
employment. Only 10% of Indian labour force – 8% informally and 2% formally acquire 
vocational skills. There is acute shortage of seats for training of workforce. The educational 
entry requirement and long duration of courses of the formal training systems are some of the 
impediments for a person of low education attainment to acquire skills for his livelihood. Thus, 
SDIS can cover Unorganized sector. The scheme covers all those above the age of 14. This 
applies equally to the requirement of road sector.
3.8.1	
Skill Development Initiative Scheme (SDIS) – Concept of Skill Development Initiative 
on Modular Employable Skills (MES) was developed by Director General of Employment & 
Training(DGE&T) with close coordination of industry and State Governments. MES is “Minimum 
Skill Set”, sufficient to get an employment. MES allows skills upgradation/ formation, multi-entry 
& exit, vertical and horizontal mobility and lifelong opportunity in a flexible manner. The skill 
is to be assessed by Assessing Bodies mainly from the Industry and Organizations. National 
Council on Vocational Training (NCVT) issues certificate of skills acquired through informal 
means/ competency assessment. The Central Apprenticeship Council (a statutory body) and 
the National Council on Vocational Training (a non-statutory body), advise the Govt. of India on 
policies, procedures, standards and norms for vocational training schemes.
3.8.2	
Features of Skill Development Initiative Scheme (SDIS) – Key features of the scheme 
are that demand driven short term training based on Short Term Courses/Modular Employable 
Skills (MES) are identified in consultation with the industry. The Central Government facilitates 
and promotes training while industry provides training through Training providers. Courses 
are available for persons having completed studies upto 5th standard onwards. Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) is envisaged in the form of active participation of industry/ private sector in 
every stage of design and implementation of the scheme.
3.8.3	
Curriculum Development Process – Sector based employable skills are identified 
in consultation with the industry, employers’, organizations, experts from International Labour 
Organization(ILO), World Bank, Central Govt./State Governments Establishments etc. Training 
modules are identified corresponding to skill set/competence. Modules in the Course Matrix

IRC:127-2018
10
are organized indicating vertical and horizontal mobility. Detailed Curriculum developed by 
Trade Committees and after approval of NCVT, is incorporated in the SDIS. The NSDC/DGE&T 
has provided guidelines for the selection of Vocational Training Providers and guidelines for 
assessment. Besides, a list of MES courses has also been worked out by NSDC/DGE&T. The 
revised list issued in September, 2012, covers 72 sectors such as, Automotive Repair, Carpet, 
Khadi, Retail, Media, Brassware, Home Décor etc. Sector No. 25 is ‘Construction’ and covers 42 
courses. Besides, there are number of courses on Construction (Annexure 1) and under other 
sectors related to Construction (Annexure 2). The special feature of this listing is that each MES 
course has a code number. For example, under ‘Sector 25 Construction’, Course Sl. No. 530 has 
MES course code “CON 106”, for Assistant Bar-Bender & Steel Fixer. For this course, minimum 
educational qualification is 5th standard, duration of training is 300 hours and test fee amount 
is Rs.800/-. All the MES courses are also graded. First grade course code starts with 1, the 
second grade course code starts with 2 and third grade course code starts with 3. For example, 
CON 101 is for Assistant Shuttering Carpenter & Scaffolder and minimum educational 
qualification is 5th Class. CON 201 is for System Shuttering Carpenter and minimum educational 
qualification for this MES courses is 5th Class plus CON 101.
3.8.4	
Implementation – In order to maintain the quality of training uniformity all over the 
country, instructional media packages, are developed by the National Instructional Media Institute 
(NIMI) Chennai and uploaded on their website i.e. www.dget.gov.in/nimi. Besides, in order to 
maintain uniformity in quality of training, terminal competency assessment tools are prepared 
and placed on DGE&T website i.e. www.dget.gov.in/nimi. In order to maintain uniformity in 
assessment, an Assessment Manual was developed and put on the DGE&T website.
3.9	
BOCW Act, 1996 and BOCW Welfare Cess Act, 1996 are important in the context of 
skill development of workmen including those for roads.
3.9.1	
The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and 
Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 (BOCW Act, 1996) was promulgated on 20th June, 1996. The 
Building and Other Constructions Workers Central Rules were framed by the Central Government 
in 1998. Building and others construction workers are recognized as one of the most numerous 
and valuable segments of the unorganized labour in India. The work is characterized by its 
casual nature, temporary relationship between employer and employee, uncertain working 
hours, lack of basic amenities and inadequacy of welfare facilities. This Act has been made 
as a comprehensive Central Legislation for regulating their safety, health, welfare and other 
conditions of service.
3.9.2	
Building and Other Construction Worker’s Cess Act, 1996 is complementary to 
BOCW Act 1996, provides for levy and collection of a Cess on the cost of construction incurred by 
Employers for augmenting the resources of Welfare Boards constituted by State Governments 
under the BOCW Act 1996. State Governments and U.T. Administrations are required to 
implement different provisions of this Act.
3.9.3	
Most important point to note is that the Central Building and other Construction 
Workers Advisory Committee considers skill development of construction workers as part of 
worker’s welfare activity. Therefore, State Governments and Union Territories can utilize part 
of welfare fund for skill development. State Government can pay for wages of workmen during

======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
11
training as also expenditure for training from this fund. Some State Governments have already 
initiated action for funding of training from the Cess. 
3.10	
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) of Construction Workers is necessary. 
Construction activity creates physical assets in a number of sectors including Roads Sector. 
Many upstream economic activities depend upon this sector. To enhance productivity and 
employability of construction workers, the Ministry of Labour and Employment undertook an 
initiative to recognize, upgrade and certify the informally acquired skills of construction workers 
from the organized and unorganized sectors. However, these workers required some formal 
training in order to obtain a national recognized certificate which would also improve their mobility 
in labour markets, in addition to increase in productivity and better wages. Ministry of Labour 
and Employment formally approved, a scheme for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) of 
construction workers. The RPL Scheme envisages pre-training assessment led measurement 
and certification process for validating current skills of the construction worker registered 
with BOCW, fifteen day long gap-training (in trade and supporting competencies) followed by 
final assessment leading to NCVT certification. This training would align to the National Skill 
Qualification Framework (NSQF) and incorporate the trade wise competencies designed in the 
National Occupational Standards (NOS). This initiative would have participation from Training 
and Assessment Partners along with industry partners. The programme was anchored by 
DGE&T and the State Construction Welfare Boards. Empanelment of Training Providers and 
Assessing Bodies was to be done centrally by DGE&T. In order to ensure quality of training 
and assessment, a Committee was set up by the Ministry with representation of the States 
Governments to empanel Training Providers and Assessing Bodies having good track record. 
The Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) informed all the State Labour Departments 
about this scheme in October, 2014. Both Workmen Training and Apprenticeship training were 
shifted from Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) to Ministry of Skill Development and 
Entrepreneurship (MSDE)  in April, 2015.

FURTHER InitiativeS for skill development
4.1	
Skills Strategy
4.1.1	
India is one of the youngest nations in the world with more than 62% of its population 
in the working age group (15-59 years), and more than 54% of its total population below 25 
years of age. To reap this demographic dividend, India needs to equip its workforce with 
employable skills and knowledge so that they can contribute substantively to the economic 
growth of the country. Our country presently faces a dual challenge of paucity of highly trained 
workforce, as well as non-employability of large sections of the conventionally educated youth, 
who possess little or no job skills. Ministry for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (earlier 
Department of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship notified in July, 2014) was set up in 
November, 2014 to give fresh impetus to the Skill India agenda and help create an appropriate 
ecosystem that facilitates imparting employable skills to its growing workforce over the next few 
decades. Apart from meeting its own demand, India has the potential to provide skilled workforce 
to fill the expected shortfall in the ageing developed world. As India moves progressively towards 
becoming a global knowledge economy, it must meet the rising aspirations of its youth. This can 
be partially achieved through focus on advancement of skills that are relevant to the emerging 
economic environment. The challenge pertains not only to a huge quantitative expansion of the 
facilities for skill training, but also to the equally important task of raising their quality. For a skills 
strategy to be successful, it should be complemented by commensurate creation of jobs in the 
primary, secondary and tertiary sectors which will be a key outcome of overall economic growth 
including entrepreneurship cutting across all sectors including roads. 
4.2	
National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 2015	
4.2.1	
Given the vast paradigm shift in the skilling and entrepreneurship ecosystem in 
the country and the experience gained through implementation of various skill development 
programmes, there was an imminent need to revisit the Skill Development Policy 2009 to align 
the policy framework with the emerging trends in the national and international milieu. National 
Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 supersedes the policy of 2009. The 
primary objective of this policy is to meet the challenge of skilling at scale with speed, standard 
(quality) and sustainability. 
4.2.2	
Skill India is initiative of the Government of India to empower the youth of the country 
with skill sets which make them more employable and more productive in their work environment. 
The Skill Mission was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 15th July, 2015. The annual 
skilling needs in the country was estimated at around 7 million in 2014. In the current landscape, 
capacity is being created by private sector training organizations, industry inhouse training, 
government and private Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Advanced Training Institutes (ATIs), 
tool rooms and in schools, colleges and polytechnics. For all existing and new capacity that will be 
generated, the focus will move from inputs to outcomes of skill training that include employability 
and placements of trainees. ‘One Nation One Standard’ should become the mantra to ensure 
that national standards and quality for skilling are globally aligned and Indian youth can aspire 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
13
to secure local, national and international job opportunities. Quality of training can be measured 
by competency outcomes and employability of trainees. 
4.2.3	
A nationally integrated education and competency based skill framework was set up to 
provide for multiple pathways, horizontal as well as vertical, within vocational education, vocational 
training, general education and technical education, thus linking one level of learning to another 
higher level. This would facilitate both horizontal and vertical mobility with formal education on 
outcome based equivalence linked to a uniform credit framework. Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), 
as industry-led bodies, were set up by making them more representative, expanding their 
outreach and increasing their efficiency. The development of National Occupational Standards 
(NOS) and Qualification Packs (QPs) for various job roles in a sector are the key responsibility of 
the SSCs. The outcome standards for each job role is needed to be clearly defined and notified 
as per NSQF. SSCs will be responsible for ensuring that persons trained as per NOS/QPs are 
employed by employers in their sector. 
4.3	
National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)
4.3.1	
The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is a one of its kind, Public Private 
Partnership (PPP) model in India, under the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship 
(MSDE). It aims to promote skill development by catalyzing creation of large, quality and 
for-profit vocational institutions. A not-for-profit company set up by the Ministry of Finance, 
under Section 25 of the Companies Act, it has an equity base of Rs.10 crore, of which the 
Government of India holds 49% share, while the private sector has the balance 51%.
4.3.2	
NSDC provides funding to build scalable and profitable vocational training initiatives. 
Its mandate is also to enable support system which focuses on quality assurance, information 
systems and train the trainer academies either directly or through partnerships. NSDC acts as a 
catalyst in skill development by providing funding to enterprises, companies and organisations 
that provide skill training. It also develops appropriate models to enhance, support and coordinate 
private sector initiatives. The differentiated focus on 40 sectors under NSDC’s purview and 
its understanding of their viability will make every sector including roads attractive to private 
investment.
4.4	
Sector Skill Councils (SSCs)
4.4.1	
Sector Skill Councils are set up as autonomous industry-led bodies by NSDC. They 
create Occupational Standards and Qualification Packs, develop competency framework, 
conduct Train the Trainer Programs, conduct skill gap studies and assess and certify trainees on 
the curriculum aligned to National Occupational Standards(NOS) developed by them. Till date, 
the NSDC Board has approved proposals for 40 Sector Skill Councils. There are approximately 
450 Corporate Representatives in the Governing Councils of these SSCs. 
4.4.2	
Development of National Occupational Standards (NOS) and Qualification Packs (QPs) 
for various job roles in a sector is the key responsibility of the SSCs. The outcome standards for 
each job role are clearly defined and notified as per NSQF. SSCs will be responsible for ensuring 
that persons trained as per NOS/QPs are employable by employers in their sector. Development 
of Standards by SSCs will be under the aegis of National Skills Qualification Committee (NSQC) 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
14
under NSQF. All NOSs and QPs developed by the SSCs will be examined and reviewed by the 
NSQC and thereafter, conferred the status of ‘National Standards’. All skill training in the country 
will necessarily align itself to these national Standards. 
4.4.3	
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) – RPL is the key instrument which can help map 
the existing skills in the unorganized sector and integrate the informal sector to the formal skilling 
landscape. The RPL framework is an outcome-based qualification framework linked to NSQF 
against which prior learning through formal/informal channels would be assessed and certified. 
The RPL process would include a pre-assessment, skill gap training and final assessment 
leading to certification of existing skills in an individual. The RPL certification would be at par with 
the certifications following various skill trainings in the country. It will provide both horizontal and 
vertical pathways to an individual for acquiring additional skills for better livelihoods. Adequate 
resources will be earmarked under various government schemes for equitable access to RPL 
programmes. 
4.4.4	
National Council on Vocational Training (NCVT), constituted in 1956, provides a 
national framework for setting curricula for various vocational courses, and also prescribes 
standards for equipment, scale of space, duration of courses, methods of training, conducting All 
India Trade Tests and awarding National Trade Certificates. NCVT will be further strengthened 
by scaling up industry representation through SSCs and laying down a national framework for all 
certification in the skill space through an autonomous body.
4.4.5	
The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is a flagship programme of 
Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). An outlay of Rs 12,000 crore to 
impart training to one crore people over the next four years (2016-20) has been envisaged. It is 
estimated that PMKVY will impart fresh training to 60 lakh youth and certify skills of 40 lakh persons 
acquired non-formally under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). The scheme, completely 
aligned to the common existing norms, moves to a grant based model where the training and 
assessment cost would be directly reimbursed to the training providers and assessment bodies 
in accordance with the norms. Skill training would be done based on industry led standards 
aligned to the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF).  Financial support to the trainees 
will be given in the form of travel allowance, boarding and lodging costs. Post placement support 
would be given directly to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). NSDC is the 
Implementing Agency and has prepared and released detailed Process Manual in May, 2015 
for the guidance of all the stakeholders under the PMKVY to help in achieving the Scheme 
outcomes. It has been laid down in the Process Manual that SSCs interested in conducting 
training and assessments under PMKVY shall submit a letter to this effect to NSDC along with 
required undertaking/documentation. It will be responsibility of SSCs to finalize the job roles 
and related parameters for assessment/marking of candidates. SSCs shall also affiliate Training 
Providers (TPs) and register Assessment Agencies (AAs) and develop their monitoring plan 
for PMKVY. SSCs are also mandated to certify the candidates after successful completion of 
the assessment and validation of the candidates based on Aadhaar and thereafter NSDC shall 
disburse reward money. The reward money shall depend on the NSQF levels achieved viz. level 
1 to 6 and the concerned skill sector of the training program viz. Manufacturing, Plumbing & 
Construction Sector or Other Sectors.

4.5.1	
The Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) is a Non-Profit 
Organization, registered under Section 8 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013 having Head Office 
at Delhi. This Council has been constituted under the mandate of National Skill Development 
Corporation (NSDC). It is supported and promoted by Confederation of Real Estate Developers 
Association of India (CREDAI), Builders Association of India (BAI), National Highway Builders 
Federation (NHBF), Construction Federation of India (CFI).
4.5.2	
CSDCI aims to develop, establish, standardize and sustain “Industry Competency 
Frameworks”, “Skills Levels”, “Occupational Standards”, “Create and deliver Capacity”, 
Investment and “Skilling outcomes”, which shall meet or exceed customer expectations through 
ethical, transparent and effective management of the Construction and Infrastructure Industry 
Skill Development Fund. CSDCI endeavors to establish, constantly monitor, update and sustain 
corporate values and ethics for all its participants, employees, industry members and related 
stakeholders with a vision to be the leading apex body of the Construction & Infrastructure 
Industry in Development and support of Skilling Solutions and advocacy of all connected Services 
for ensuring the skill needs of the Construction Industry.
4.5.3	
The basic objective behind the formation of CSDCI is to create a credible and effective 
mechanism with the support of relevant and interested stakeholders to manage the task of skill 
development across the country and meet the current and future skill needs of the construction

chapter 5
POLICIES PROMOTING SKILLING MISSION
5.1	
National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship aims to provide an 
umbrella framework to all skilling activities being carried out within the country, to align them 
to common standards and link skilling with demand centres. In addition to laying down the 
objectives and expected outcomes, the policy also identifies the overall institutional framework 
which will act as a vehicle to achieve the expected outcomes. Skills development is the shared 
responsibility of the key stakeholders viz. Government, the entire spectrum of corporate sector, 
community based organizations, those outstanding, highly qualified and dedicated individuals 
who have been working in the skilling and entrepreneurship space for many years, industry and 
trade organizations and other stakeholders. The policy links skills development to improved 
employability and productivity in paving the way forward for inclusive growth in the country. The 
skill strategy is complemented by specific efforts to promote entrepreneurship in order to create 
ample opportunities for the skilled workforce.
5.2	
It is envisaged that the objectives and targets under the National policy will be 
met in mission mode approach. The Mission is housed in MSDE and the key institutional 
mechanisms for achieving the objectives of the Mission is divided into a three-tier structure 
at the Centre to steer, drive and execute the Missions objectives. The Mission Directorate is 
supported by three other institutions: National Skill Development Agency (NSDA), National 
Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), and Directorate General of Training (DGT). National 
Skill Development Agency (NSDA) which was set up as a Society in June, 2013 will focus on 
the two verticals of Quality Assurance and policy research in the skills space. National Skill 
Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership which was set up in 2008 will 
be the nodal organization for all private sector initiatives in the short term skilling space. The 
two verticals of Training and Apprenticeship Training under DGE&T, The Ministry of Labour 
& Employment (MoLE) have been shifted to Directorate General of Training, MSDE from 
16th April, 2015. Its large institutional framework consisting of ITIs, ATIs, RVTIs and other national 
institutes will act as tools of execution for Mission activities.
5.3	
The Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs), Govt. of India, through 
Gazette Notification dated 06.06.2013 decided that the National Skill Development Agency 
(NSDA) shall subsume the Prime Minister’s National Council on Skill Development (created in 
July, 2008), the National Skill Development Coordination Board (NSDCB) and the office of the 
Advisor to PM on Skill Development. The NSDA was mandated to coordinate and harmonize the 
skill development efforts of the Government and the private sector to achieve the skilling targets 
of the 12th Plan and beyond. The Central Ministries and NSDC would continue to implement 
schemes in their remit. Another guideline to NSDA was that it would anchor the NSQF and 
facilitate the setting up of professional certifying bodies in addition to the existing ones. Specific 
functions as laid down in the notification were mandated to be performed by the NSDA. 
5.4	
The Ministry of Labour, DGE&T notification dated 04.03.2014 contained the accepted 
recommendations of the Working Group constituted to revamp all DGE&T schemes. The 
recommendations primarily focused on method of admission criteria, training/skill upgradation 



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
18
of trainers, filling up of vacancies against sanctioned posts, setting up of new ITIs where density 
was less than the national average, especially in trades where private sector was not willing. 
Another important accepted recommendation for implementation was about ensuring quality 
in availability of manpower for jobs of Paper Setters, Examiners, Moderators, Tabulators and 
Checkers etc. by creating a pool of qualified persons through a transparent process of inviting 
online applications. For assessment of practical examination, retired instructors of ITIs as well 
as workshop faculties of polytechnics could be empaneled as assessors and prepared for 
assessment procedures. Further, in order that the ITIs continue to satisfy laid down norms, a 
process of re-affiliation after a certain number of years, with annual targets has been prescribed 
in the notification.
5.5	
Public funds (funding by Central Government, State Governments and Grant based 
schemes) are finite and will not be able to cover the magnitude of the challenge of Skilling India. 
Hence additional sources of funds are required. Therefore, all stakeholders, the Government 
both at Centre and States, the enterprise both public and private, and the direct beneficiary (the 
individual), would contribute in mobilizing financial or in-kind resources for skill development. The 
success of the policy will depend upon the quantum of resources mobilized from all stakeholders.
	
a)	
National Skill Development Fund (NSDF) has been set up by Government 
of India with the objective of encouraging skill development in the country. A 
public Trust set up by Government of India is the custodian of the Fund. The 
Fund acts as a receptacle for all donations, contribution in cash or kind from 
all Contributors (including Government, multilateral organizations, corporations 
etc) for furtherance of the objectives of the Fund.
	
b)	
To channelize the interest of a plethora of organizations to participate in the 
mission of Skill India, a strategic vehicle to create a multiplier effect on skilling 
has been devised. It will serve as the aggregator vehicle for pooling the funds of 
multilateral agencies, companies, foundations, NGOs and individuals for skilling 
interventions by leveraging existing infrastructure and resources. The platform 
will also be subjected to timely audits to ensure that the contributions are used 
for the intended purpose.
	
c)	
To attract funds from Industry, Companies will be encouraged to spend at least 
25% of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds on skill development 
initiatives directly or through NSDF. Further, industry should earmark at least 2% 
of its payroll bill (including for contract labour) for skill development initiatives in 
their respective sectors. These funds can be channelized for skill development 
activities either through respective SSCs or through NSDF.
	
d)	
All Government schemes across sectors will be encouraged to apportion 
a certain percentage (10%) of the scheme budget towards skilling of human 
resources in local regions in the required sector. These funds could be used for 
implementation directly or be routed through NSDF. Government may consider 
other options including cess etc. to raise funds for meeting the requirements of 
this sector.
	
e)	
End user funding through a basic fee paying model will also be a key medium for 
funding training activities. However, the Government believes that the inability 
to pay training costs should not stop any desirous citizen in the country from 
acquiring any certified skill training. The Government will promote grant of 



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
19
scholarships, rewards and Skill Vouchers (SV) for funding of training costs as 
provided in the Policy document.  It will also be ensured that for all government 
schemes, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) will be used as a mechanism for payment 
disbursement.
	
f)	
A Credit Guarantee Fund for Skill Development and a National Credit Guarantee 
Trustee Company (NCGTC) has been set up to support the initiative of loans 
for the purpose of skilling and will be used to leverage credit financing in the 
skill landscape. It will be further expanded to ensure greater outreach and 
access to all citizens. Similarly, a Credit Guarantee Fund for Entrepreneurship 
Development worth Rs. 3000 Crore per year has already been initiated under 
Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana through NCGTC.
5.6	
Incentives by the Government
5.6.1	
National Service Scheme (NSS) is a vehicle which can engage students in real, long 
term projects partnering with other stakeholders in society – NGOs, Corporates through their 
CSR, Foundations and Educational Institutions themselves. NSS has the potential to become a 
youth movement in which youth give time to social issues and acquire skills that enhance their 
employability.
5.6.2	
Weighted deduction of the expenditure incurred on Skill Development under Section 
35CCD of the IT Act. The Finance Act, 2012 has inserted a new section 35CCD in the IT Act 
which provides for a weighted deduction of 150% of expenses (other than land or building) 
incurred on skill development project notified by the Board in accordance with the guidelines. 
At present, Companies engaged in manufacture sector were included, later on Companies 
operating in service sector are also eligible. The National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) has 
been declared as the nodal agency for evaluating the applications made by eligible companies 
for availing this to the Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT).
5.6.3	
Funding of Skill Development activities – Large sums of money have been collected 
by State governments from construction projects through the Building and Other Construction 
Workers Cess. As per clarification issued by Ministry of Labour and Employment on 21.05.2012, 
the expenditure incurred towards various activities of the Skill Development Scheme will be 
funded from the Cess collected under BOCW Act, 1996. The Government has also issued 
statutory directions in July, 2013 to the effect that 20% of the BOCW Cess funds would be utilized 
for skill upgradation or vocational training of construction workers and their family members. The 
expenditure of training, assessment fee and a wage compensation, currently @ Rs. 35 per hour 
to the worker to offset loss of wages during class room training and assessment, are paid by 
Welfare Boards from the Cess.

CHAPTER 6
FIELD OF ACTIVITIES IN ROAD SECTOR
6.1	
Civil construction work is common for built environment and infrastructure sectors. 
For civil construction, manufactured goods and natural mineral products are brought to the 
project site. Workmen, Machine Operators and Supervisors of different trades carryout the 
work to implement the road project according to drawings and designs. By and large skills are 
currently acquired by workmen, hand-on and taking guidance from seniors. Generally, they do 
not undergo structured vocational education training in the related trade. 
6.2	
Comprehensive listing of trades, and in turn categories of workmen, is a difficult task 
on account of multifarious activities involved. Still, it is desirable to prepare a consolidated list of 
all categories of workmen involved in the road sector. It may not be possible to prepare a final list 
in the first instance. Therefore, listing has to be kept open ended so that as and when required, 
new categories can be added. Number of sub-heads for training under the road sector will have 
to be developed. 
6.3	
Sub-heads for Road Sector – Sub-heads for road sector are to be developed 
in judicious manner. The development of sub-heads can be Qualification Pack / Trade 
oriented and/or Process oriented. Besides, in specific cases these can be sector specific. 
A list of proposed sub-heads for roads is as follows: (a) Laboratory Testing/ Geotechnical 
and Material Investigations, (b) Topographic Surveys, Landscaping Schedules, (c) Land 
Schedules to facilitate process of land Acquisition, (d) Equipment/ Machine Operation like 
Road Rolling, Excavation Tunnel Boring, Pile Driving, Crane Operating etc., (e)  Masonry, 
(f) Cement Concrete, (g ) Bar Bending & Steel Fixing, (h)  Form work, (i) Structural Steel Work/ 
Aluminum work (j) Road work including Concrete Pavement, (k) Sanitary installation/ Water 
Supply/ Drainage, (l) Welding, (m) Electrical/ Air-Conditioning/ Fire-fighting, (n) Environment, 
Health & Safety, (o) Horticulture/ Landscaping/ Water Harvesting/ Tree Plantation and 
(p) Specialist – Geosynthetic/ Signages/ Pre-stressing/ Post Tensioning/ Bearings/ Expansion 
Joints/ Reinforced Earth.
6.4	
Listing of Categories of Workmen
The information about different categories of Qualification Packs for trades, supervisors, operators 
etc. has been taken from following sources:
	
i)	
Qualification Packs/Trades included in the CSDCI/DGE&T list under heads 
related to Highway Sector and Construction. 
	
ii)	
Qualification Packs/Trades as per Standard Data Book of MoRTH and MoRD.
	
iii)	
CPWD Schedule of Rates.
	
iv)	
Other Agencies engaged in Road Construction.
	
v)	
Trades designated under Construction Sector as per Apprenticeship Act, 1961.



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
21
6.5	
An attempt has been made to prepare a comprehensive list of different categories after 
consulting documents of MoRTH, CPWD, Ministry of Rural Development and others involved in 
road construction. Categories of workmen listed in the MoRTH Data Book is not exhaustive. 
The nomenclatures adopted by DGE&T should prevail for the sake of uniformity across the road 
sector. While the CSDCI/ IESC list has been extracted from the construction related activities 
therein, lists of other departments/agencies are for either road works or building works. Thus, 
there is enough scope to add additional categories in other sectors at appropriate time. Besides, 
some categories not included in above lists have been added. Currently many patented items 
are also in use for which manufacturers provide the installation without which warranty is not 
applicable. Such specialized categories of workmen are not included in the list.
6.6	
Different categories are to be listed under proposed sub-heads. If there is difference 
in the nomenclature for the same category of workmen in different lists, the nomenclature given 
in CSDCI list has to prevail and clarification notes to be given along with the list regarding 
difference in nomenclature with other lists, if any. Following seven lists have been prepared.
	
a)	
Listing of Courses: List of Courses extracted from Modular Employable Skills 
(MES) prepared by DGE&T / CSDCI / IESC and also approved by NCVT/NSQC. 
Annexure 1 and Annexure 3 lists out courses related to construction sector 
or primarily civil engineering field. Annexure 2 included MES courses, also 
prepared by DGE&T, relates to other sectors but essentially required during 
execution of road projects. The list includes fields like electronics, fabrication, 
material management, security etc. This list also indicates minimum educational 
qualification and Modular Employable Skill (MES) required for enrolment to a 
particular course. Annexure 4 lists out qualification packs prepared by the IESC 
in the operator and mechanic categories. The DGE&T and CSDCI lists also 
include duration of the training courses. Fee payable are as per common norms 
issued by the Government.
	
b)	
Consolidated List of Categories: Consolidated List of Categories available 
in documents of MoRTH, CPWD, Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) 
and others involved in road construction has been compiled for Supervisors/
foremen and given in Annexure 5, and that for workmen in Annexure 6. In 
Annexure 6, asterisk marked categories are similar (in a few cases with slightly 
different nomenclature) to courses in Annexures 2 & 3. To this extent there 
is some overlap. Courses for these categories are required to be developed 
on lines similar to those prepared by DGE&T / IRC / CSDCI /  IESC. MoRTH and 
MoRD can take a lead in this matter by engaging suitable agencies.
	
c)	
Trades / QPs Designated under Construction Sector as per Apprenticeship 
Act, 1961 : The typical construction trades designated under Apprenticeship 
Act, 1961 for ITIs are more or less biased towards the typical workshop floor 
practices. Their institutional training duration need to have on the job project site 
training which shall be covered under apprenticeship training. On the other side, 
the workmen entering through RPL/MES route are exposed to project sites and 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
22
need structured training for which the training centers at project sites shall take 
care. The suggested levels of certification for trades already approved under the 
Apprenticeship Act have been compiled and given in Annexure 7.
	
d)	
Certain ancillary categories like security, accounting, storekeeping etc. which 
provide support to the construction agencies for smooth implementation have 
been included in these Annexures. Training in these fields, though may not be 
in the complimentary list, would enhance efficiency where deployment of such 
categories is made mandatory under the agreement.

chapter 7
ProvisioNS in various contract documents
7.1	
In standard contract formats of all the departments in the country, there exists a 
provision for deploying only skilled workers but it is not defined therein, how a worker will be 
judged for his skills. In the absence of certification, only choice left to a worker is himself defining 
his skills and there is no option for the contractor or engineer, but to rely on him. Many times, in 
the race of getting a suitable job, worker may not be suitably qualified, but he will project himself 
of being capable of handling high-tech jobs without even realizing the sensitiveness of the job, 
he is going to handle once put in position. A few contract provisions relating to contractor’s 
personnel are as below: -
	
a)	
In FIDIC conditions of contract, the provisions regarding contractors’ 
Superintendence (Para 6.8), Contractor’s personnel and records are in Clauses 
6.9 and 6.10. Text of these provisions is given in Annexure 8. There is difficulty 
in implementation of this clause as there is shortage of trained and certified 
workmen at present.
	
b)	
CPWD Conditions of Contract – Clause 19 K of CPWD Contract provides 
for employment of qualified tradesmen not less than 20% of each trade for all 
contracts exceeding Rs. 5 crore. A few institutions like CPWD Training Institute, 
ITIs, NICMAR, CIDC and similar institutions recognized by Central / State 
governments are recognized for certification. The text of this clause is given in 
Annexure 9.
	
c)	
MES Conditions of Contract relating to deployment of qualified workmen appears 
as Clause 26. The Clause provides that number of qualified tradesman shall not 
be less than 25% of the total in each trade. The text of this Clause is given in 
Annexure 10. 
	
d)	
EPC Agreement, Clause 3.4.1, provides that contractor shall ensure that 
personnel engaged by it or by its Sub-Contractors in performance of its 
obligations under this Agreement at all times are appropriately qualified, skilled 
and experienced in their respective functions in conforming with Good Industry 
Practice.
	
e)	
Model Concession Agreement for Annuity Based Project, provides that Good 
Industry Practice means the exercise of that degree of skill, diligence, prudence 
and foresight in compliance with the undertaking and obligations under this 
Agreement which would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and 
experienced person engaged in implementation, operation and maintenance or 
supervision or monitoring there of or any of them of a project of the type similar to 
that of the project. Further Clause 5.4 (a), (v) and (vii) gives the requirement and 
importance of periodical tests. These tests can be conducted by a competent, 
properly qualified and certified Laboratory Assistant.
7.2	
While there is provision of employing skilled workmen in the Government Contracts, 
but the actual situation is different. Therefore, to meet the objective, the next step can be to send 
the already deployed workmen for training and get them certified. After such arrangements are 



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
24
made, then with the passage of time, it will be observed that a large number of workmen are 
certified and skilled workers will be available on the job. Again, the problem arises as to how to 
bind the contractor to send the deployed workmen for the training since it amounts to paying 
the worker not for the job at site but paying for his training. No contractor will agree to this 
proposal, unless there are suitable compensation means for assuring their absence from work, 
though in the long run it will be beneficial to the contractor by way of better workmanship and 
increased output. One of the options is making such provisions in the bid document itself before 
commencing the procurement process. Otherwise, there can be a provision for incentive to 
contractors for providing training to the workers deployed by them. There can also be a provision 
in the agreement that the workmen deployed can undergo the essential training within a limited 
period, say within 3 months, failing which the workmen will not be allowed to continue on the job. 
Side by side, arrangements need to be in place for strengthening the infrastructure and faculty 
of the Training Providers.

EXISTING TRAINING FACILITIES
8.1	
As the magnitude of infrastructure development picked up pace, acute shortage 
of trained and skilled manpower was felt in the country. Maintaining of quality and speed of 
construction for the fast growing and evolving construction industry as well as pressure of 
employability of the huge work force led a few organizations to start training of workmen even 
prior to the launch of Skill Development Mission in the Eleventh Plan. Brief details of some of 
these initiatives is given below.
8.2	
National Academy of Construction (NAC), Hyderabad
Recognizing that construction is one such area where technology is developing at a fast rate and 
one needs proper understanding of the technology and importance of proper training, the NAC 
was established in Hyderabad at the initiative of the Government of Andhra Pradesh in the year 
1998 for bringing overall development in the Standards of the Construction Industry in India. The 
State Government has allotted over 46.46 acres of land for constructing the NAC campus. The 
Institution runs based mainly on voluntary contributions of Builders Association of India of Andhra 
Pradesh Chapter. According to State Government orders, 0.1% of the estimated cost of all works 
in all Engineering Departments and Corporations in the State is to be deposited periodically 
with National Academy of Construction. It is registered as a Society and incorporated as Public 
Charitable institution. Starting with one centre and five trades and training 150 technicians 
per year, NAC has grown to 110 centres throughout Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States 
and 21 trades today with target of training 1,00,000 technicians per annum. For Administrative 
convenience, NAC has created six regional centres which are also headed by Regional Directors, 
Assistant Directors appointed in each district for better co-ordination and Quality control of the 
training programs. To augment and play an effective role, NAC is now establishing three Zonal 
centres with a capacity of 2000 trainees per annum in each Zonal Centre. According to NAC, 
these Advanced Skills Training Institutes (ASTI) are expected to become the future hubs of 
trades training.
The NAC offers Construction Trades Training (90 days) with facility of free boarding and lodging 
and visit to Project Sites. The training is structured to equip unskilled workers with basic skill, 
coupled with hands on experience enough to begin a career as qualified construction technicians. 
Minimum age is 18 years. Different basic qualification is required for eligibility for training in 
different courses. On completion of training, NAC awards a certificate to the successful candidate, 
thus enabling him to obtain employment anywhere in the relevant trade. Successful trainees are 
also assisted in securing employment in private sector construction industry. The training is 
offered, among other in the fields related to Civil construction such as General Works Supervisor, 
Highway Works Supervisor, Land Surveyor, Store Keeper, Formwork Carpentry, Masonry, Bar 
Bending, Welding. The NAC also offers Skill upgradation training programmes, in the fields of 
Formwork Carpentry, Masonry, Bar Bending and Welding. Duration of such courses is usually 
15 days.

Construction Skills Training Institutes (CSTIs)
8.3.1	
Larsen and Toubro Co. (L&T), has been playing a key role in creating skilled labour 
through its Construction Skills Training Institutes (CSTIs) that are spread across the country. 
L&T began to promote Construction Vocational Training (CVT) in India by establishing a 
Construction Skills Training Institute (CSTI) in late 1995 at Chennai. CSTI has been developing 
skilled workforce through structured training. Such structured training enables both new entrants 
and less experienced workers in the industry, progressively improve their knowledge and 
competencies in the respective trades. Construction Skill Standards are formulated for different 
trades after carefully analyzing the knowledge and the skill expected for each level of competency. 
In addition, different trade tests have been specified to assess the knowledge and skill level 
obtained. The Construction Skills Training Institute (CSTI) has campuses at Chennai, Mumbai, 
Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Cuttack for Practical and Class Room 
Training. One CSTI is under development at Nagpur, especially for Road construction training.
8.3.2	
The organization considers that skill upgradation is necessary so that a worker can 
move upwards in the career path of the organization. In the overall career map, labour segment 
has three levels; Helper, Assistant and Skilled Worker. In the supervisor segment, another three 
levels are there; Charge Hand or Highly Skilled, Foreman and Supervisor. Thereafter managerial 
segment starts. Occupational Standards (OS) are taken from Qualification Packs of CSDCI. 
Outcomes are laid down for each job which describes what individual needs to know and 
understand in order to carry out a particular job, role or function. These are also the performance 
standards that individuals must achieve when carrying out functions in the work place, together 
with specification of the underpinning knowledge and understanding. The following briefly 
describes the training process which is aligned to the National Skill Qualification Framework 
(NSQF) and incorporates the trade wise competencies designed in the National Occupational 
Standards (NOS);
	
i)	
Location of Training Centres: The Training Centres are located either zonal 
wise or as per the project cost. Since road projects are linear in nature it is 
advisable that these Training Centres are at the mid location or at place where 
other logistic concentration is there.
	
ii)	
Faculty: The suitable faculty are the retired or old technicians who have worked 
in the field. However, they need to undergo a trainer’s course for at least 15 
days. As far as modern technology is concerned, the faculty for the same has to 
be pooled in from the main dealers or manufacturers.
	
iii)	
Basis of Selection of Trainers: The criterion for selection of trainees is based 
on the type of requirements i.e.
	
a)	
Road Layer Level-1 can be a person with minimum literacy and having 
some construction experience as labourer on road work.
	
b)	
Road Layer Level-2 can be a person having minimum experience of two 
years after passing Level-1 certification and education level can be high 
school fail or equivalent.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
27
	
c)	
Road Layer Level-3 can be a person with three years of experience after 
passing Level-2 or a high school pass with at least two years of experience 
on Road Works.
	
iv)	
Wages during Training: The wages during training is governed by the Minimum 
Wages Act for that area. During training, the cost per Trainee generally works 
out to Rs. 30/- per hour which includes consumables and faculty etc.
	
v)	
Syllabus: The syllabus is developed as per National Skill Qualification 
Framework (NSQF) Levels in the form of Qualification Pack (QP) & National 
Occupational Standards (NOSs) which is mandatory as per the Government 
Gazette Notification.
	
vi)	
Assessment of Skill Level and Gap Analysis: It is outsourced.
	
vii)	
Trade Test & Certification: It is done by CSDCI / DGT, Ministry of Skill

chapter 9
APPRENTICESHIP FOR CONSTRUCTION SECTOR INCLUDING ROADS
9.1	
Considering the peculiarities and issues involved in the Construction Sector, including 
roads, some important issues related to apprenticeship programme are to be considered. It is 
likely that this may require modification in the Apprenticeship Act, 1961. Besides, it is suggested 
that for a few years, the apprenticeship programme be directly coordinated by the Ministry of 
Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Government of India in consultation with respective 
State Government, Employers i.e. Contractors in Construction Sector as the latter are not likely 
to invest for training of temporary employers as they are hired for duration of project. Therefore, 
Government support in the form of stipend to workers and supervisors is considered necessary. 
The apprenticeship training is to be imparted by the nominated company and the assessment, 
testing as also certification has to be done by third party having industry Experts, DGT Officials 
and Independent Observers. Training Centres are to be established by developer/company/
contractor at project sites. Besides, construction companies having large workshop of plant and 
machinery should be financially supported to establish Apprentice Training Centre for Operators 
and Machines, as required by the Industry.
9.2	
The trade training modules to be based on Qualification Packs (QP) and National 
Occupational Standards (NOS) for various job roles at different work duly approved by the 
Government. A typical hierarchy pyramid for construction trade is given in Annexure 11. 
The movement of job roles is given in Annexure 12 and typical flow chart of Apprenticeship 
Engagement is given in Annexure 13.
9.3	
The apprenticeship should be for three levels as under:
	
a)	
Graduate Engineers Training (GET) for six months;
	
b)	
Supervisory level for six months;
	
c)	
Workers level or Tradesmen levels for 12 months.
Government should give at least 75% cost of stipend. This should cover cost of training, faculty, 
establishing the Training Centre, Consumables, productivity loss, uniform and Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE). The balance cost to be borne by the Employer engaging the apprentices. The 
number of Apprentices to be decided on the basis of manpower projection for the entire duration 
of the project, as per Contract Agreement. Number of apprenticeship can be 15% for worker’s 
level, 25% for Supervisors level and 50% for GET level. It is suggested that apprentices at 
Worker and Supervisor levels should be monitored and controlled by DGT/ NSDC whereas that 
of Engineers should be monitored and controlled by Ministry of HRD. Apprentices from Institutes 
and Training Establishment are to be selected by Employer. Training centres at project site to 
be selected by a selection panel nominated by the Government. Consideration may be given to 
include one Government Representative, one from the Industry and an Independent Technical 
Observer, in the panel.

chapter 10
building capabilities for training of workmen
10.1	
Background	
10.1.1	
In order to accomplish the task of building capability in the road sector, skilled workmen 
(trained and certified) of different categories are required in huge numbers. The workmen are 
available but unfortunately most of these workmen are neither trained nor certified. This gap is 
affecting both quality and productivity. By and large, workmen do not possess required skills and 
they lack knowledge in their field of activity. The only way out is to develop required skills and 
provide knowledge base by imparting basic education and training to workmen and thereafter 
give them trade test to certify them for the required level.
10.1.2	
Existing provisions in the contract documents are not effective in dealing with this 
situation. Therefore, there is a need to have a specific provision in the contract documents and 
its strict enforcement. As the prime co-coordinating Ministry for the road sector, the MoRTH has 
recently taken the initiative of Skill Development/upgradation of workmen in the road construction 
sector for projects with civil works of Rs.100 crore and above. The salient features of the current 
guidelines are as under:
	
i)	
Skill development/upgradation of workmen would be taken up by the concerned 
Project Head/Executive Engineer through the Authorized Training Centre of 
Director General of Training (DGT), MSDE, Government of India as per the 
NSQF.
	
ii)	
Training cost would be met out of the provision of contingency fund at a rate of 
0.05 percent of the total estimate cost of civil work.
	
iii)	
Trainees would be paid stipend up to a maximum limit of Rs.15,000/- per person 
on the basis of minimum wages to compensate for loss of income during the 
training period.
	
iv)	
The Authority (MoRTH, NHAI, NHIDCL, State PWD) will nominate its Nodal 
Officers (Project Director/Executive Engineer) and furnish the list of sites where 
training infrastructure is to be set up by the Training Providers.
	
v)	
The Project Director/Executive Engineer will be responsible for implementing 
the training/assessment.  The Training Provider (TP) and the Assessing Body 
(AB) shall be allocated by the DGT.
	
vi)	
The TP shall provide the relevant data of the trainees like Name, Qualification, 
Aadhaar Card, Residential Proof, Bank Account details etc. to the concerned 
Project Director/Executive Engineer for payment of stipend to the trainees.  The 
letter would ensure that stipend is deposited directly into bank account of trainee.
	
vii)	
Transportation facility, if required for the trainees from site to the nearby villages 
may be provided by the concerned Project Director/Executive Engineer. Charges 
for transport shall be paid as per the actual with the approval of competent 
Authority.



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
31
	
viii)	 The expenditure towards training shall be met against 0.10 per cent of project 
estimate and shall include:
	
a)	
Payable to the Training provider
l	
Training cost @ Rs.32.50 per hour per worker. This rate will increase 
by 10% from every financial year (1.04.2018 onwards).
l	
Tool kits at the rate of Rs.1500/- to be provided to the worker.
	
b)	
Payable to the Assessing Body
l	
Assessment fees at the rate of Rs.1000/- per worker after declaration 
of result by respective RDAT.
	
c)	
Miscellaneous
l	
Transportation charges for the worker.
l	
Charges for consultant and data entry operator at the DGT 
Headquarters
	
ix)	
The TP shall provide training infrastructure at site after approval of the concerned 
Project Director/Executive Engineer.
	
x)	
The TP would inform the concerned Regional Directorate of Apprenticeship 
Training (RDAT) about the site approval.
	
xi)	
The TP shall maintain daily attendance biometric system linked with Aadhaar 
Card of the construction worker which will be required for reimbursement of 
Training cost.
	
xii)	
The TP will submit details of workmen along with daily attendance during the 
training to the respective RDAT.
	
xiii)	 The Authority can recommend new organization for empanelment of TPs and 
ABs to the DGT for their consideration and approval.
	
xiv)	 Assessment will be done by the ABs empaneled by the DGT, MSDE and it would 
be as per NCVT Norms.
	
xv)	 ABs will submit details of assessments to respective RDAT for issuance of NCVT 
certificate which is recognized for employment.  Competencies would also be 
inscribed on the certificate.
	
xvi)	 The names along with relevant particulars for the certified will be uploaded on 
the web portal of the MoRTH and the MSDE.
The Contract documents and agreements would be amended as per the following provisions:
	
i)	
The Contractor/Concessionaire will try to hire at least 10% trained workmen 
as per NSQF. If necessary, the requisite workmen may be got trained through 
recognized institutes.
	
ii)	
The Contractor/Concessionaire will organize training at project site for the trainees 
as and when required as per the training schedule finalized in consultation with 
training institutes and the Project Director/Executive Engineer.

32
For ongoing projects supplementary agreements may be signed duly incorporating the above 
provisions.
10.1.3	
Gradually the financial limit for project costs should be lowered to encompass entire 
road sector. Once the advantages of deploying trained and certified workers are seen and 
facilities for training developed, even the construction industry would welcome this step and 
not consider it as a burden. It is to be realized that participation by road contractors would 
happen only when the Employer starts enforcing the contract provisions relating to engagement 
of trained personnel on works.
10.1.4	
For Rural Roads and smaller contracts, training center needs to be established at 
least at the District level. Facilities available with ITI’s and other training centers established 
at the State level should be availed of wherever feasible. CSDCI / IESC / DGT have a list of 
various agencies working for skill development. The Institution of Engineers has decided to 
provide training to trainers as well as conduct trade test and provide certification to successful 
candidates. At present this facility is available at Hyderabad, but such facilities can be and 
need to be extended to other places. The senior management in the Employer’s (contractors) 
organizations need to appreciate and recognize the necessity and importance of deployment of 
trained and certified workmen through short term training.
10.2	
Planning for Training Centre
10.2.1	
Training Agency/Organization can consider starting workmen training centers at those 
places where major construction projects are in progress or likely to be started shortly. These 
projects can be in public sector or private sector. The administrative authority of the project 
should be willing to deploy Training Agency for training of workmen employed at project site, 
with or without financial commitment. The Contractor, Sub-contractor and others should also be 
desirous for giving co-operation to facilitate the training activity. Before starting training, it will be 
desirable to create an informal positive attitude towards training of workers and their certification. 
It is felt that workmen shall be willing to get trained, so long as wages during training are not 
affected. It is expected that they will be happy to get trained. Positive environment has to be 
created for training, before starting the actual training.
10.2.2	
The Contractor having a construction project in progress can propose establishing 
the workmen training centre. The centre has to run under the control of a Training Coordinator 
Committee to be formed at that place, consisting of a Training Coordinator to be nominated by 
Principal Employer and Nodal Officer to be deployed by Contractor. Other members can be 
nominated as required. It will be preferable to have a Nodal Officer with Degree or Diploma in 
Civil Engineering having field experience. The contractor shall submit the proposal for Training 
Centre at his place with recommendations for names of Nodal Officer and Members after taking 
their consent. The details about projects and number of workmen likely to be trained should also 
be given.
10.3	
Starting Training Centre
10.3.1	
The Training Centre must have faculty of trainers. Trainers will have to be recruited 
on full time or part time basis and will be certified as trainer by CSDCI / IESC. To start with, for 



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
33
each trade, at least one trainer is required. The trainer should have adequate knowledge of 
trade, preferably both in practice and theory. He should be able to demonstrate the work of his 
trade, either himself or through a workman and should have an aptitude to train. Trainers can 
be selected from different walks of life which include qualified and/or experienced supervisors, 
experienced workmen, artisans, instructor of ITI etc. The trainer should be willing to impart 
training on the basis of his experience and knowledge. These trainers may be required to go to 
designated Training Centre where training of trainers will be organized by CSDCI / IESC.
10.3.2	
The expenditure for training centre will include wages of Secretary, Trainers, 
Assistants, T&P, furniture, materials, stationery, etc. Depending on projection of activity, the 
budgetary requirements should be worked out for financial year and sources for funding should 
be identified. These include (i) administrative department Incharge of the project, (ii) Contractor, 
(iii) Labour Department of the State Government or its wing which collects Workmen Welfare 
Cess. Alternatively, some prominent member of Industry or any other donor can finance the 
training. The budgeting can be done for each project separately.
10.4	
Trades and Syllabus
10.4.1	
CSDCI / DGE&T, NSDC, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Govt. 
of India has published Course Curricula for Short Term Courses in Construction Sector. 
Specific course curricula will be required to be developed through expert agencies for trades 
not covered by CSDCI / DGE&T. For all the trades included for training, details of terminal 
competency, optional terminal competency, practical competencies and underpinning knowledge 
(Theory), as provided in CSDCI / DGE&T/NSDC documents or developed documents will have 
to be compiled in advance. Once certification is given to workmen for these basic trades of 
level I, initiative can be taken to start level II courses which may include, for example, Masonry, 
System Shuttering Carpenters, Conventional Shuttering Carpenters, Scaffolder, Bar-Bender, 
Rigger, Welder, Batch plant operator and Electricians of higher competence.
10.4.2	
The entry qualification is pre-decided for all the trades. If the trainee workman does 
not have required qualification, he has also to be given adequate educational input equivalent 
to required level as prescribed. Besides, duration of training as given in CSDCI/DGE&T/NSDC 
documents is for a fresh entrant to the trade. The training courses should be designed for 
imparting training to workmen already in the profession, so duration of training course can be 
suitably reduced on the basis of initial competency level of trainees.
10.5	
Preparations for Training at Project Site
10.5.1	
The Employer should nominate its site representative for coordinating training 
activity. Preferably an Assistant Engineer or equivalent officer, who is available at the project site 
should be nominee of the Employer. Similarly, the Contractor, Sub-Contractor etc. should also 
nominate their representatives. Before starting training work, it is necessary that a meeting is 
arranged at project site where senior representatives should be requested to join. This includes 
trainers, Employer’s engineers connected with the project, Contractor’s Project Manager and 
other managers, representatives of Sub-Contractors and other concerned with the project. This 
formal meeting should be conducted as per pre-arranged programme. The trainers should be 



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
34
familiarized for work to be undertaken and others have to give their views. Anticipated difficulties 
can be discussed and sorted out. Facilities and infrastructure required for training, which includes 
a class room, laboratory, say 30 Sqm. area each for a batch of 30 trainees, furniture and other 
necessities, to be provided by Employer/Contractor should be spelled out and decided in the 
meeting. The broad concept should be given in the meeting that as far as possible, workers are 
not to be disturbed from their normal job except during practical demonstration in working hours. 
Besides, beyond normal working hours, trainees will have to spend one hour with trainers, for 
theory classes. Moreover, depending on specific requirement, it might be necessary to send 
workers for training outside the project site. The purpose of bringing out various issues in this 
introductory meeting is to ensure that all concerned give full cooperation for success of training. 
It has to be management of training by participation. Minutes of introductory meeting should be 
drawn and circulated and all concerned should cooperate in the training activity according to 
decisions taken during the meeting.
10.5.2	
Employer/Contractor should intimate the total number of workmen in each category 
separately, as available at project site. Out of these workmen under each category, only 15 to 
20 should be considered for preliminary tests and not more than 10, under each trade should be 
trained in each batch. Second batch can be taken after the training of first batch is completed. 
Total period for training should be predetermined as per trade/QP & level of QPs.
10.5.3	
Thereafter, the Employer/Contractor should forward the list of workmen under different 
categories, to be considered for training, in the first batch. For each workman, the application 
form with photograph, should be filled up and kept on record. The needful should be done by a 
pre-decided date, so that training proceeds as per Schedule. In case total number of trainees in 
some category is likely to be less than 10, it will be desirable to get some workmen from nearby 
project sites, if possible.
10.6	
Entrance Test of Trainees and Gap Analysis 
10.6.1	
Once list of trainees with application forms is forwarded to Training Agency, by 
Project Authorities, an introductory meeting should be arranged by Secretary, Management 
Committee, at project site, where trainees and trainers can be introduced to one another. 
A feeling of active participation for training should be got generated in the trainees. 
10.6.2	
The purpose of entrance test of trainees is to ascertain individually, the skill, knowledge 
of profession and education level, already available with the trainee. Since required skills are 
decided by standards laid down by CSDCI / NSDC / DGE&T for most of the categories, the gap 
between the desired and, as available with the trainee, has to be ascertained. This entrance 
test is to be taken by at least two trainers (one being for the trade concerned).  Depending on 
situation, it can be verbal and practical. Normally it should be possible to judge the competence 
level of an individual in one hour time. 
10.6.3	
A workmen should have knowledge, required skill and educational qualification as 
prescribed for his trade/QP. Besides, the workmen are expected to have the knowledge of other 
trades having interface with his trade. Moreover, safety requirements should also be known to 
the workmen.  For guidance of trainers, on the basis of experience gained in entrance test at 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
35
project sites, suggested lists of questions to be asked should be prepared for different trades 
in advance. These will be helpful to trainers to give entrance tests. As trainers gain experience, 
they will be able to decide ways and means to examine trainees during entrance test.
10.6.4	
After assessment/entrance test, for each workman, a report has to be prepared 
indicating his level of competence.  Thereafter, a comprehensive report for each trade has to 
be prepared, indicating level of competencies of different workmen and selecting trainees for 
each trade. Others who cannot be selected should be informed about their proficiency level and 
guidance given for improvement by highlighting weakness/shortcomings. These workmen can 
be asked to improve and Employer be informed to help them. They can be considered in next 
batch. The report should be submitted to Chairman Management Committee for acceptance 
by the Committee, and returned with observations, if any, to Secretary/Training Coordinator for 
undertaking training. 
10.7	
Organizing Training 
10.7.1	
On the basis of Gap Analysis and review of knowledge of proficiency level of each 
trainee, it is possible to work out, separately for each trade, the competence of trainees. Trainers 
should prepare separate report for their trades and submit proposals for the training indicating 
the demonstrations required for practical work and input of theory, to raise the level of trainees to 
the Standards of CSDCI / DGE&T Syllabus. These reports for all the trades should be discussed 
between Secretary and trainers. After discussions, reports should be modified on a common 
plan for working. The details of identified trainees should be divided in batches and their details 
including Aadhaar number and bank account be uploaded on Skill Development Management 
System (SDMS) under NSDC, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Govt of India.
10.7.2	
Each trainer should prepare detailed breakup of practical work and theory, in number 
of sessions. The experience gained on training at the projects has indicated that about ten 
practical demonstration sessions and about thirty theory classes should normally cover the total 
input required by trainees. However, it is left to the trainers to decide the time to be allotted for 
practical demonstration, training and theory. 
10.7.3	
Practical demonstration will have to be organized during working hours. For each 
session, theory to be taught and practical demonstrations to be given should be pre-decided and 
pre-conceived leaving nothing to chance. Materials, equipment, tools and any other aid should 
be arranged beforehand. Effort should be made to arrange the demonstration at a place where 
the work is in progress. Session should cover knowledge about materials, tools, techniques etc. 
It should be interactive session, giving opportunity to trainees to participate. After demonstration 
session, questionnaire should be given to trainees to fill their replies in Yes/No format. This 
should be taken back immediately thereafter and kept in record individually for each trainee. 
10.7.4	
If necessary, for highly skilled job, demonstration can be organized outside project 
site. Specific training for a job can also be arranged at existing training centres. 
10.7.5	
Trainees normally remain engaged in their allotted work by Contractor. The trainer 
has to inspect the work of each trainee, every working day and spend time with him/her giving 
suggestions for improvements. Trainer has to keep record of each trainee and trainee has to 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
36
keep record of work done by him/her on each day indicating improvements suggested and the 
manner in which these were implemented. The training centre has to issue work notebook to 
each trainee to record details of his/her work and input received from trainer. 
10.7.6	
Theory classes are to be organized after normal working hours. Theory classes 
should generally cover common subjects for all the disciplines such as knowledge of language 
(reading and writing), arithmetic, reading of drawings, safety requirements, health requirements, 
coordination requirements etc. Common lectures should be planned for each trade separately. 
For all lectures, a questionnaire should be given at end of lecture and got filled from the trainees, 
immediately at the close of lecture session. 
10.7.7	
The details of training imparted should be reviewed and discussed by trainers. In case 
any shortcoming is noticed, additional demonstration class or theory class should be arranged.
10.7.8	
After completion of training, an Internal trade test should be arranged, similar to the 
test being conducted by approved certification agencies. After trainees are declared successful 
in internal trade test, they are ready for trade test by approved agency of CSDCI.
10.8	
Assessment and Certification 
10.8.1	
CSDCI, NSDC, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Govt. of India has 
affiliated and circulated a list of approved and affiliated agencies. Assessment will be carried 
out by CSDCI through certified assessors of these affiliated agencies. After assessing the skill/
capabilities of workmen (trainee), they will publish results through Skill Development Management 
System (SDMS) under NSDC and issue certificates. CSDCI should be approached giving 
information about batch, details of trainees, date of assessment to be carried out and necessary 
fees deposited in advance. They will carry out assessment at their centre and workmen should 
be taken to that centre as per pre-decided programme. After the certificate is issued by the 
agency, it should be given to the workmen.

Training of technicians
11.1	
Training is to be imparted for several other categories such as Laboratory Technician, 
Supervisors, Surveyors, Equipment Operators etc. In order to develop broad concept of training 
in these categories, one example of Laboratory Technicians has been given here. The purpose 
is to train and certify Laboratory Technicians for testing of concrete from mixing to placement to 
maturity. Various steps involved in this process and the required tests as per BIS, IRC:112 and 
MoRTH Specifications are to be identified. The testing procedure, acceptance criteria, which 
includes sampling at source/batching plant/ cement godown, testing at site laboratory and site 
itself are to be identified and listed. The complete testing procedure including formats used 
during the testing of samples is to be compiled for distribution to the participants. These persons 
in the training programme should include technicians working in the laboratory, contract workers 
deployed at site including Engineer at junior level, work assistants working with the concrete, 
workers at RMC plant and those deployed at batching plant at site/casting yards etc. Group of 
15-20 participants should be formed for one batch. They should be imparted training in class 
room as well as laboratory.
11.2	
Suitable class room equipped with Projector, Screen, Board with marker plus etc. 
should be selected for class room training. Before the start of the training course, one copy of 
the Study Material should be distributed to all the participants. After the class room training on 
a particular subject, the candidates should be sent to site laboratory, to get demonstration of 
the testing as per relevant course, by the experienced lab in charge. Immediately after the field 
training, the candidates should be asked to test the concrete themselves so that any problem 
faced can be identified and solved at that time in such a manner that candidates become familiar 
with the testing procedure studied in the class room and in the laboratory. The relevant extracts 
of BIS codes should be included in the course so that they will not find any doubt. In case of any 
doubt, relevant BIS code can be referred. For recording the readings, proper formats should be 
developed along with the calculation sheets, wherever required, on the required format itself. 
The acceptance criteria should also be included in the format to ensure that the testing is done 
correctly as per the prescribed procedure. 
11.3	
The laboratory should be either National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration 
Laboratories(NABL) accredited one or having such required facilities. Sometimes, it is required 
to select site laboratory so that the candidates can get a feel of testing the live samples directly 
received from the field or specimens prepared by the participants from the concrete being used 
actually in the field. 
11.4	
Two types of faculty members i.e. Trainers are required. One to conduct class room 
training and the other to conduct field training. Trainers of class room training should be those who 
are associated in the field like Assistant Engineers and Executive Engineers. The idea behind 
selection of such personnel is that they can share field experience in a better manner than the 
faculty of some teaching institutions. Faculty of Technical Institutions are suitable for giving the 
technical background. The persons demonstrating the test in the laboratory are those who are 
getting in-depth knowledge in the area of testing procedure as prescribed in the relevant course. 



======================================================================

One of the important subjects identified is Quality Assurance, to sensitize the lab technicians 
about this important aspect of Engineering. 
11.5	
For certification of trainees, it is necessary to conduct examination through certified 
Assessors of affiliated Assessment Agencies of CSDCI. Trainees should be given question paper 
to test the knowledge acquired. Besides, there should be practical examination in laboratory, 
followed by viva examination as per guidelines of CSDCI/NSDC. Trainees should be declared 
pass only when they score marks as specified in the Qualification Pack/Trade Book.

12.1	
In the preceding chapters, emphasis has been made on the training, assessment and 
certification of workers. For this, it is necessary to ensure that suitable facilities for training them 
are available. The facilities include: 
	
a)	
Physical Infrastructure like training institute, class rooms, laboratories/project 
site for practical training. 
	
b)	
Designing the curriculum suitable for each category of workers along with making 
the literature and study material available in soft as well as hard format. 
	
c)	
Trained and certified trainers for providing training and basic knowledge and 
skill for relevant Qualification Pack/Job roles to the workers as good industry 
practice. 
12.2	
The training of trainers should be carried out at selected training centre which are 
better equipped and have lead trainers to provide the training to trainers. These training 
centres can be called as ToT centres or Skill Academies and will have boarding and lodging 
facilities. Training for Trainers / Lead Trainers are provided by Lead Trainer at ToT Centres 
(Skill Academies). 
12.3	
Training of Trainers (ToT) course be designed based on relevant Qualification Pack/
Job roles as per ToT guidelines of NSDC. The curriculum and syllabus shall be as defined in 
the respective Qualification Pack (QP) and shall adequately cover the complete domain of the 
QP and platform skill for both Trainer and Lead Trainer. Operating Manual of the construction 
machineries and equipment is good source to define the syllabus for each kind of machine and 
should be taken into account while preparing the syllabus. It will be ensured that training of 
trainer be carried out by trained and certified Lead Trainer only.
12.4	
Trainers and Lead trainers should be selected as per pre-requisites of qualification 
and experience for the NSQF level and specific QP as fixed by SSC. The trainer should have 
adequate experience and knowledge about the equipment operation. The minimum experience 
and qualification required for trainer and lead trainer as given by CSDCI / NSDC will be ensured. 
Experts of equipment manufacturers be invited to act as Guest Faculty. Success of any training 
programme lies in the quality of training imparted which is possible only from the competent and 
experienced trainers available to impart training to the workers in the class room. The trainers 
should also keep themselves well versed with the advancement in the technologies in field. The 
training will be provided both on domain of the QP as well as platform skill. After all, they hold 
the key to fulfilling the mission of skill development of workmen and achieving the mission of 
deploying skilled and certified workmen on the job.
12.5	
After completion of training, assessment will be carried out by a Lead Assessor/
Assessor certified by CSDCI / SSC. The assessment will include both formative and summative. 
Formative assessment will be carried out by the Lead Trainer during the training period.

Summative assessment will be carried out in two parts i.e. Domain Skill Test & Platform Skill Test. 
The Trainers and Lead Trainers will be declared qualified once they score more than 80% (for 
Trainer) & 90% (for Lead Trainer) marks at domain and platform skill separately. On successful 
completion, a certificate will be issued to that effect.

CHAPTER 13
WAY AHEAD
13.1	
Road Sector though serves the purpose of a common man, but it is a specialized sector, 
if we look into specialized aspects like alignment, geometrics and other important structures like 
flyovers, underpasses, bridges, tunnels, interchanges etc. A well designed and well-constructed 
road can serve the purpose very well, but a poorly designed and poorly constructed road can 
spoil the project without achieving desired results.  Annual expenditure in road sector is going 
to be in the range of Rs. 160,000 to 200,000 crore per annum. With such huge investments at 
stake, it is essential that the project should not only be of good quality but also it should be well 
designed and meaningful to the society with due attention paid to the environmental and social 
site ground issues. In other words, the aim is to have  sustainable development in road sector 
and in order to achieve this aim, it is essential that the work force deployed at ground level 
should be skilled.  At times, the project is designed by the best consultants and even assigned 
to the best construction agency at the best rates, but the outcome may not be the best, if the 
competent and skilled work force is not deployed at the construction site.  Skilled workmen 
should be deployed on the job for obtaining the desired results in the best interest of the society. 
13.2	
Another issue which comes out is the availability of skilled workmen for which it is 
essential that quality training institutes should be made available at adequate number of places 
spread across length and breadth of the country considering its vast area.  Further, along with 
quality training institutes, it is essential that the trainers should also be well experienced, well 
qualified and have an inclination to impart training to the workmen in a professional manner. 
Hence, in order to achieve the objective, training of the trainers is also equally important as that 
of the training of the workmen. 
13.3	
It is necessary that the client departments act as facilitators and provide the necessary 
information. They should also encourage industry partners to develop linkage with Sector Skill 
Councils to obtain part of the funds required for the training.
13.4	
As the prime coordinating Ministry, the MoRTH has  taken the lead that, for all 
contracts of value more than Rs. 100 Crore there is a provision for deployment of trained and 
certified workmen in the designated categories. Gradually, this financial limit may be lowered to 
encompass the entire road sector.
13.5	
There is another line of thought to ensure that required action/decision gets 
implemented. Why mention the requirement (like in FIDIC – “The Contractor’s personnel shall 
be appropriately qualified, skilled and experienced in their respective trades or occupations.”), 
when it is to be implemented in an environment, for example, where traffic police is also required 
along with the traffic light. This line of thought suggests that the Contract provisions should 
be sufficiently detailed to include specific mention of categories, level of training and syllabus, 
acceptable training and certifying organization/institutions, how the wages and cost of training to 
be met and the penalty for default. Also, it is not a onetime affair. Required categories of trained 
persons in required number are to be available throughout the duration of the Contract. That is 
to say that the Employer, while preparing the bid document, should also do his home work in 
working out such details for inclusion. Gradually, the requirement in bid documents should shift 



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:127-2018
42
from training most of the workmen at site to employing mostly already trained workmen. A good 
example of detailed Contract provision of a specific requirement of the Employer is regarding 
Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Bidding Document.
13.6	
It is also necessary to consider health and hygiene at worksites, safety concept at 
work sites and at labour camps. Current labour laws and regulations provide for this. More 
than one trade workers for completing a part of the job, e.g. carpenter, bar bender, mason, 
vibrator operator etc. for RCC work are required. Therefore, group is to be trained jointly as 
most of the workers are uneducated,  develop syllabus on topics other than work to impart 
some basic knowledge regarding language (regional or national +Hindi or English) sufficient 
to read and write, basic arithmetic, basic understanding of the subject and understanding of 
instructions, Yoga classes, Ethics or Neeti Shastra different for different standards of education 
like for persons educated - up to class V, VIII or X, living conditions, health, basic hygiene could 
be part of ethics syllabus for overall improvement of wellbeing of workers.
