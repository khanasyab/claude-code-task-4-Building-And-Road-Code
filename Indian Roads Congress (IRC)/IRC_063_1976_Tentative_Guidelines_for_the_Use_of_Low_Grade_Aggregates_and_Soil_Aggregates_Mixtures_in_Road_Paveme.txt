TENTATIVE GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF
LOW GRADE AGGREGATES AND SOIL
AGGREGATE MIXTURES IN ROAD PAVEMENT
CONSTRUCTION
I.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Hard aggregates are not available in some
parts
of the
country.
In
some
areas, these are costly and not
available within
economical leads. Under these circumstances, use of locally available
low-grade aggregates assumes
great
importance.
At
present,
the
engineer often looks for hard aggregates even
if the cost is high. The
main handicap in the use of low-grade
aggregates
was
that
there
was no guidance available
in this respect.
Keeping this
aspect
in
view, the Soil
Engineering
Committee
(personnel given below)
in
their meeting held at Gandhinagar on the 29th November 1972 pre-
pared these tentative guidelines for the use of low-grade aggregates.

The draft guidelines were processed by the
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee in their
meeting held on 31st
January and
1st February 1974 and
later approved by the
Executive Committee
and the Council in their meetings held on
the 22nd December 1975
and 3rd January 1976.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
Low grade
aggregates
are
those
aggregates which lose
strength
generally by
more than
15 per cent
upon
wetting, when
measured in terms of
their
Aggregate
Impact
Value.
Low-grade
aggregates can be used as such
if their Wet Aggregate
Impact Value
does not exceed 50 per cent.
If the Wet
Aggregate
Impact Value
exceeds 50 per cent,
they
would
require
to
be
suitably processed
before being used.
This could be achieved
either through stabilisa-
tion, say in accordance
with IRC: 28-1967
"Tentative Specification
for the Construction of Stabilized Soil Roads with
Soft Aggregate in
Areas of Moderate
and High Rainfall" or using
the
aggregates in
a soil-aggregate mixture as discussed in para 6.
2.2.
Since one of the significant characteristics of most
types
of low grade aggregates is loss of mechanical strength upon wetting,
the testing
of
such
aggregates
should
invariably
be
done in
the
soaked condition, as per IS: 5640-1970, "Method of Test
for Deter-
mining Aggregate
Impact
Value of Soft
Coarse Aggregates".
In
addition to this,
it
is advisable to run dry
Aggregate Impact
Value
tests occasionally (vide
IS: 2386
Part IV)-1963 to get an idea about
the comparative performance of the concerned aggregates.
3. COMMON TYPES OF LOW GRADE AGGREGATES
3.1.
Some of the common types of low grade aggregates that
are normally encountered in
India
are
mentioned in
Table
1.
It
should be noted that
the
aggregates
can
sometimes
be of a
very
variable quality, for instance Dhandla.
As such mere nomenclature
should not be the guide for selection of aggregates
but
their actual
physical
characteristics.

TESTING OF LOW GRADE AGGREGATES AND
SOIL-AGGREGATE MIXTURES
4.1.
Some of the tests considered
appropriate
for evaluating
the suitability of low grade aggregates and of soil-aggregate mixtures,
for use in pavement construction, are indicated in Tables 2 and
3.
Table 2.
Testing of Low Grade Aggregates
(i) Aggregate Impact Value Test (wet/dry as mentioned in Clause I) —
IS:5640-1970/IS:2386 (Part IV)-1963.
(ii) Sodium sulphate soundness test (This test need be
conducted
only
if
the
aggregates
are
to
be
used
in
a
sulphate-infested area)
IS:2386 (Part V)-1963,
(iii) CBR on samples soaked for 4 days (only in the case of moorum
or
soil-aggregate admixtures)—IS:2720 (Part XVI)-1965.

CRITERIA FOR USE OF LOW GRADE AGGREGATES
5.1.
Physical Requirements
5.1.1.
Low grade aggregates can be used for sub-base or base
courses of road pavements,
or
even
sometimes
as surfacing.
For
application in individual cases, the suitability of aggregates,
except
for materials like moorum, should be based
on
the Wet Aggregate
Impact Value.
Recommended limits in this regard are set
forth
in
Table 4.

5,1.2.
In the case of materials
like moorum,
suitability
for
use in pavement courses should be judged
on
the
basis
of soaked
CBR values.
Whether moorum
is used as sub-base
for
high
class
roads, or as a surfacing for lightly trafficked roads, the soaked CBR
value should not be less than 20.
Where
this
requirement
is
not
satisfied, or a
still higher strength
is desired, this could
be
achieved
through cement or lime stabilisation in accordance with IRC:50-1973
and IRC
: 51-1973 respectively.
5.2.
Gradation
5.2.1. Low grade aggregates should be reasonably well graded
so as to achieve a dense and well interlocked mass.
Recommended
gradings for aggregates to be used in Water Bound Macadam
cons-
truction
are
given
in IRC
: 19-1972.
For
low
grade aggregates,
these gradings should be taken by way of guidance only
since
such
aggregates are generally of a crushable nature.
6.
CRITERIA FOR USE OF SOIL-AGGREGATE MIXTURES
6.1.
Soil-aggregate mixtures may be in the form of
naturally
occurring materials like soil-gravel, or soil
purposely
blended
with
suitable aggregate
fractions.
The primary criteria for
acceptability
of such materials are plasticity index and gradation.
Plasticity index
of the material should be
less
than
6
when
used
as
sub-base
or
base course with bituminous
surfacing
and
between
6 and 9 when
used as a surfacing for lightly trafficked roads.
Criteria
for
grada-
tion should be as set forth in para 6.2.
6.2.
The material should be smoothly
graded
for
achieving
the maximum possible dry density.
Fuller's
grading
rule**
could
be used as a guide to work out
the optimum
grading
in
different
cases.
A few typical
gradings
are
given
in
Table 5
for
general
application.
The
first three gradings indicated in Table 5 are
espe-
cially suited for base courses whereas the remaining two are suitable
both for base course and for surfacing.
Note
:
*Samples for tests should be
representative
of
the
materials
to be used and collected in accordance with the procedure
set
forth in 18:2430-1969.
Fuller's grading rule
is given by per cent passing

be
retained

each
pair
of
successive
sieves
specified
for
use
except for
the
larger pair.
6.3.
Apart from PI value and gradation,
soil-aggregate
mix-
tures may also be evaluated on the basis of soaked CBR value deter-
mined in accordance
with
IS: 2720 (Part XVI)-1965.
Where
this
approach
is followed, CBR should desirably
be not less than 20 for
use as a sub-base.
In the case of base courses, the acceptable value
of CBR for heavily trafficked routes is normally 80, but a somewhat
lower value could be permitted for arid areas, or light volume
roads
depending on the discretion of the Engineer-in-charge.
7.
PAVEMENT DESIGN
7.1.
Thickness of flexible pavements using low
grade
aggre-
gates or soil-aggregate mixtures should be
designed
in
the
normal
way in accordance with IRC
: 37-1970 "Guidelines for
the
Design
of Flexible Pavements".
Minimum thickness of any
such
courses
5



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 12
======================================================================
IRC
: 63-1976
should be 10-15 cm, except in the case of moorum, when
it
should
be 15 cm.
7.2.
For use as sub-base
under
rigid
pavements,
guidance
can be had from IRC
: 58-1974, "Guidelines for the Design of Rigid
Pavements for Highways".
7.3.
Whenever low-grade aggregates are used as
a
sub-base/
base course, these should be laid
preferably
on
a
well compacted
subgrade.
Also the road should be kept well drained.
