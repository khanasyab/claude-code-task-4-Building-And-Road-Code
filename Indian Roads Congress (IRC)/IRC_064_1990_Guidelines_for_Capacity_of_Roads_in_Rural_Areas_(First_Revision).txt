GUIDELINES FOR CAPACITY OF ROADS IN
RURAL AREAS
1
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Capacity
analysis
is
fundamental
to
the
planning,
design and operation of roads, and provides, among other things,
the basis for determining the carriageway width to be provided at
any point in a road network with respect to the volume and com-
position of traffic. Moreover,
it is a valuable tool for evaluation of
the investments needed for future road construction and improve-
ments, and
for working out
priorities between the competing
projects.
1.2.
"Tentative Guidelines on Capacity of Roads
in Rural
Areas" were published by the Indian Roads Congress in 1976 (IRC
:
64-1976). Since then some basic research on this topic has been car-
ried out in the country, notably through the Road User Cost Study,
in which experiments were conducted to measure free speeds,
and speed-flow relationships
at a series of sites under typical
Indian traffic condition. This has led to a better understanding of
the speed and volume characteristics on roads of different pave-
ment widths and types under various conditions.
1.3. Based on findings from the above studies, as well as
current practices in other countries,
it has been p>ossible to revise
the Tentative Guidelines published earlier and place them on a
more firm footing. At the same time,
it is recognised that as a result
of additional data coming through, especially under the Traffic
Simulation Studies currently in progress, the capacity standards
may need further modification in due course.
1.4. These
guidelines
were
considered
by
the
Traffic
Engineering Committee (personnel given below) in their meeting
held at New Delhi on the 27th March, 1990.

These were processed by the Highways Specifications and
Standards Committee in their meeting held on 16th April 1990, sub-
ject to certain modifications which were subsequently carried out
by the Convenor and Member- Secretary of the Committee. These
guidelines were then approved by the Executive Committee and
later by the Council for publication in their meeting held on 20th
March and 29th April 1990, respectively.

2. SCOPE
2.1. The guidelines contained in this pubUcation are applic-
able to long stretches of rural highways as presently existing in the
country. For this the rural highways are considered as all-purpose
roads, with no control of access, and with heterogeneous mix of
fast and slow-moving vehicles.
2.2. The capacity values recommended further on apply in
general
to those sections which have neither the restraints of
narrow
structures
nor any
deficiencies
of
visibility
or
other
geometric features like curves. Moreover, the norms indicated are
meant to be used only when a nominal amount of animal-drawn
vehicles (say upto 5 per cent) is present in the traffic stream during
the peak hour, which
is generally the case on rural highways.
2.3. The guidelines are not applicable to the design of inter-
sections on rural highways. The capacity of these intersections will
have to be determined individually. The guidelines are also not
applicable to urban roads and streets.
2.4.
Further, the capacity of access-controlled roads, such as
expressways,
is outside the purview of these guidelines.
3. DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS-
3.1. An understanding of concept
of highway capacity
is
facilitated through a clear definition of certain terms.
3.2. Speed is the rate of motion of individual vehicles or of a
traffic
stream.
It
is measured
in metres per second,
or more
generally as kilometres per hour. Two types of speed measure-
ments are commonly used in
traffic flow analysis;
viz.
(i) Time
mean speed and
(ii) Space mean speed. For the purpose of these
guidelines, the speed measure used
is "Space mean speed"
3 .3. Time Mean Speed is the mean speed of vehicles observed
at
a point on
the road over a period
of time.
It
is the mean
spot speed.
3.4. Space Mean Speed is the mean speed of vehicles in a traffic
stream at any instant of time over a certain length (space) of road.
In other words, this is average speed based on the average travel
time of vehicles to traverse a known segment of roadway.
It
is
slightly less in value than the time mean speed.

======================================================================
IRC
: 64-1990
3.5. Volume (or flow)
is the number of vehicles that pass
through a given p)oint on the road during a designated time interval.
Since roads have a certain wddth and a number of a lanes are
accommodated in that u^idth, flovv^ is alvv^ays expressed in relation
to the given vvddth (i.e. per lane or per two lanes etc.). The time unit
selected is an hour or a day. ADT is the volume of Average Daily
Traffic when measurements are taken for a few days. AADT is the
Annual Average Daily Traffic when measurements are taken for
365 days of the year and averaged out.
3.6. Density (or concentration)
is the number of vehicles
occupying a unit length of road at an instant of time. The unit
length is generally one kilometre. Density is expressed in relation
to the width of the road (i.e. per lane or per two lanes etc.) When
vehicles are in a jammed condition^ the density is maximum.
It is
then termed as the jamming density.
3.7. Capacity
is defined
as the maximum hourly volume
(Vehicles per hour) at which vehicles can reasonably be expected
to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a
given time period under the prevailing roadway, traffic and control
conditions.
3.8. Design
Service Volume
is defined
as
the maximum
hourly volume at which vehicles can reasonably be expected to
traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or roadway during a
given time p)eriod under the prevailing roadway, traffic and control
conditions while maintaining a designated level of service.
3.9. Peak-Hour Factor is defined as the traffic volume during
peak hour expressed as a percentage of the AADT. The peak hour
volume in this case is taken as the Thirtieth Hourly Volume (i.e. the
volume of traffic which
is exceeded only during 30 hours in a
year).
4. SPEED-FLOW RELATIONSHIPS
4.1. The idealised relationship between speed, volume and
density is expressed in the three basic diagrams given in Fig.
1
which are collectively known as the Fundamental Diagram of Traf-
fic Flow.

4.2.
It will be seen that the speed-density relationship
is a
straight line, having maximum speed (free speed) when traffic is
low and having zero speed when vehicles are jammed.
4.3. The speed-volume
relationship
is
a parabola,
having
maximum volume
at
a value
of speed equal
to half the
free
speed.
4.4. The density-volume relationship is a parabola, having a
maximum
volume
at
a
value
of
density
equal
to
half
the
jamming density.
4.5. The following relationship exists
:
Q
=K.V
where
Q
= Volume
K
= Density, and
V
= Speed
4.6. Maximum volume that can be accommodated on the road
(Qmax, or vehicles per unit time)
is considered to be the road
capacity. From the idealised relationship shown in Fig. 1,
it can be
seen that the maximum volume occurs at half the free speed and
half the jamming density, meaning thereby that

5. LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS)
5.1.
Level of Service is defined as a qualitative measure des-
cribing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and their
perception by drivers/passengers.
5.2.
Level of Service definition generally describes these con-
ditions in terms of factors such as speed and travel time, freedom
to manoeuvre,
traffic
interruptions,
comfort, convenience and
safety. Six levels of service are recognised commonly, designated
from A to F, with Level of Service A representing the best operating
condition (i.e. free flow) and level of service F the worst (i.e. forced
or break-down flow).
5.3.
Fig. 2. shows the various levels of service in the form of
indicative volume-flow
conditions.
Each
of the
levels can be
generally described as follows

Q MAX. CAPACITY
Fig.
2. Speed volume curve shovdng levels of service
Level of Service A
:
Represents a condition of free flow. Individual users are vir-
tually unaffected by the presence of others in the
traffic
stream. Freedom to select desired sf>eeds and to manoeuvre
within the traffic stream is high. The general level of comfort
and convenience provided to the road users
is excellent.
Level of Service B
:
Represents a zone of stable flow, with the drivers still having
reasonable
freedom
to
select
their
desired
speed and
manoeuvre within the traffic stream. Level of comfort and
convenience provided is somewhat less than level of service
A, because
the presence of other vehicles
in
the
traffic
stream begins to affect individual behaviour.
Level of Service C
:
This also is a zone of stable flow, but marks the beginning of
the range of flow in which the operation of individual users
becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in
the traffic stream. The selection of speed is now affected by
the presence of others, and manoeuvring within the traffic
stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of the user.
The general
level
of comfort and convenience
declines
noticeably at this level.

======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 22
======================================================================
IRC
: 64-1990
Level of Service D
:
Represents
the
limit
of
stable
flow,
with
conditions
approaching close to unstable flow Due lo high density, the
drivers are severely restricted
in
their freedom
to
select
desired speed and manoeuv re within the traffic stream. The
general
level of comfort and convenience
is poor.
Small
increases in traffic flow will usually cause operational pro-
blems at this level
Level of Service E
:
Represents operating conditions when traffic volumes are
at or close to the capacity level. The speeds are reduced to a
low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to manoeuvre
within
the
traffic stream
is
extremely
difficult,
and
is
generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle to give way to
accommodate such manoeuvres. Comfort and convenience
are extremely poor, and driver frustration is generally high
Operations at this level are usually unstable, because small
increases in flow or minor disturbances within the traffic
stream will cause breakdowns
Level of Service F
:
Represents zone of forced or breakdown flow. This condition
occurs when the amount
of
traffic approaching a
point
exceeds the amount which can pass
it. Queues form behind
such locations
Operations within the queue are charac-
terised by stop-and-go waves, which are extremely unstable.
Vehicles may progress
at
a reasonable speed for several
hundred metres and may then be required to stop in a cyclic
fashion. Due to high volumes, break-down occurs, and long
queues and delays result
6. CAPACITY AND DESIGN SERVICE VOLUxME
6.1. From the viewpoint of smooth traffic flow,
it is not advis-
able to design the width of road pavement for a traffic volume
equal to its capacity which is available at LOS E. At this level, the
speeds are low
(typically half the free speed) and freedom
to
manoeuvre
within
the
traffic
stream
is
extremely
restricted.
Besides, at this level, even a small increase in volume would lead to
forced flow situation and breakdowns within the traffic stream.
Even the flow conditions at LOS C and D involve significant vehicle
interaction leading to lower level of comfort and convenience. In
contrast, Level of Service B represents a stable flow zone which
affords reasonable freedom to drivers in terms of speed selection
and manoeuvres within the traffic stream. Under normal circum-
stances, use of LOS B is considered adequate for the design of rural
highways. At this level, volume of traffic will be around 0.5 times
the maximum capacity and this
is taken as the "design service
volume" for the purpose of adopting design values.
8



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 22
======================================================================
IRC
: 64-1990
6.2.
It
is recommended that on major arterial routes LOS B
should be adopted for design purposes. On other roads under
exceptional
circumstances, LOS C
could
also be adopted
for
design. Under these conditions, traffic will experience congestion
and inconvenience during some of the peak hours which may be
acceptable. This is a planning decision which should be taken in
each case specifically after carefully weighing all the related factors.
For LOS C, design service volumes can be taken as 40 per cent
higher than those for LOS B given in subsequent paragraphs.
6.3.
In the context of rural highways,
it is usual to adopt daily
traffic volumes for design instead of hourly volumes. Therefore,
the hourly flows need to be converted to daily values on the basis
of observed or anticipated hourly pattern of traffic during the 24
hour day. Currently, the peak hour factor on trunk routes in the
country
is around 8-10 per cent of the AADT and
the
capacity
figures recommended in the guidelines have been based on this.
6.4. The design service volume that should be considered for
design/improvement of a road
facility should be the expected
volume at the end of the design life. This can be computed by pro-
jecting the present volume at an appropriate traffic growth rate.
The traffic growth rate sh- mid be established after careful study of
past trends and potential for future growth of the traffic.
7. EQUIVALENCY FACTORS
7.1. The result of the presence of slow moving vehicles in traffic
stream is that it affects the free flow of traffic. A way of accounting
for the interaction of various kinds of vehicles
is to express the
capacity of roads in terms of a common unit. The unit generally
employed is the passenger car unit'. Tentative equivalency factors
for
conversion
of
different
types
of
vehicles
into
equivalent
passenger car units based on their relative interference value, are
given in Table
1. These factors are meant for open sections and
should
not
be
applied
to
road
intersections.
It
needs
to be
recognised
that the conversion
factors are subject
to variation
dependent upon the composition of traffic, road geometries and
travel speeds. The equivalenc\ factors given below are considered

representative
of
the
situations
normally
occurring and
can
therefore be adopted for general design purposes.

In practice, the equivalency factors u^ill vary according to
terrain.
However,
for purpose
of these
guidelines;
the same
equivalency factors as given above can be used for rolling/hilly sec-
tions since the effect of terrain has been accounted for in a con-
solidated manner in the Design Service Volumes recommended
subsequently in Tables 2, 3 and 4 for different widths of road.
8. RECOMMENDED DESIGN SERVICE VOLUMES FOR
SINGLE LANE ROADS
8.1.
Single-lane bi-directional roads are ofcommon occurrence
in low volume corridors. For safe and smooth operation of traffic, a
single lane road should have at least 3.75 metre wide paved car-
riageway with good quality shoulders such as moorum shoulders
of minimum 1.0 metre width on either side.
8.2. The recommended design service volumes of single —
lane roads are given in Table 2.

Hi 1990
earthen shoulders are available. The capacity figures relate to peak
hour traffic in the range of 8-10 per cent and LOS B.
10.3. The capacity of two lane roads can be increased by pro-
viding paved and surfaced shoulders of at least 1.5 metre width on
either side. Provision of hard shoulders results in slow moving traf-
fic being able to travel on the shoulder which reduces the inter-
ference
to
fast
traffic on
the main carriageway. Under these
circumstances, 15 per cent increase in capacity can be expected
vis-a-vis the values given in Table 4.
10.4. Where shoulder width or carriageway width on a two
lane road are restricted, there will be a certain reduction in capacity.
Table 5 gives the recommended reduction factors on this account
over the capacity values given in Table 4.

roads under mixed traffic conditions is not yet available. Capacity
on dual carriageway roads can also be affected by factors like kerb
shyness on the median side vehicle parking etc
Tentatively,
a
value of 35,000 PCUs can be adopted
for four-lane divided
car-
riageways located in plain terrain.
It is assumed for this purpose
that reasonable good earthen shoulders exist on the outer side, and
a minimum 3.0 m wide ccnitral verge exists.
11.2.
Provision of hard shoulders on dual carriageways can
further increase the capacity as explained in para 10 3
In case well

On dual carriageways
it will normally not be desirable to adopt
