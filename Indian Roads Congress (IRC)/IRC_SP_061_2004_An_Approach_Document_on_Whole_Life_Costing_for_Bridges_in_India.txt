constituted a Sub-group consisting of Dr. T.N. Subba Rao (Convenor) and S/Shri A.G. Borkar, S.R.
Tambe, A.K.
Harit, D.K. Kanhere &
Dr. H.
Subba Rao
as members
for
drafting an Approach,
Document on Whole Life Costing for Bridges
in India.
The draft prepared by the Sub-group was
discussed
in a number of meetings by the B-9 Committee. As the subject matter
is new and needed
wider interaction, B-9 Committee decided that the entire document should be discussed
in the IRC
Session as a Paper, comments obtained and thereafter the document finalised.
Accordingly, the Paper appeared as Paper No. 439, in Vol. 57-2 of IRC Journal.
The Paper
was discussed at the IRC Session in Nagpur in January, 1997.
Comments made by the participants
were considered by the B-9 Committee in its meeting held on 20.12.1999 at Mumbai and the document
was forwarded to the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee. The personnel of B-9 Committe

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
In the last two decades a large number of roads and bridges were built in India and
majority of them were constructed in reinforced or prestressed concrete.
There was a general and
comfortable attitude that reinforced and prestressed elements were more durable than structural steel
elements and hence economical
in terms of lifetime maintenance.
The past decade has indicated a
somewhat different picture with damages due to extensive corrosion of reinforcement and prestressing
steel used in bridge decks and substructures.
Surveys
in America and U.K. also have shown that
the cost of repairs or replacement of such bridges
is often more than the original capital cost of the
bridge
itself. As a result, there has been rapidly an increasing awareness of the importance of long
term durability of bridges and
its effect on the Whole Life Cost (WLC) of a bridge.
In addition, in
India, the future programme of bridge asset preservation
is
likely to be dominated by two major
requirements:
•
To strengthen a large number of existing bridges;
•
To modify ok replace a substantial number of existing bridges to accommodate widened
roads.
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
With the
large cost associated with any
traffic disruption caused during the process of
strengthening, modification or replacement, a new appreciation has arisen of the need to allow for such
possible future operations, within the lifetime of a newly designed bridge.
Bridge designers are, therefore, faced with the idea of 'Whole Life' or 'Life Cycle Costs',
defined as
'the costs of all activities associated with a bridge during
its
life'. The useful
life
of a bridge
is currently set at around 50 to 60 years in India.
In that time span, the significant cost
flows are:
•
The high initial cost of design and construction including environmental cost.
•
The regular inspection and maintenance costs over the bridge lifetime to ensure effective
performance.
•
The repairs, which could be expected during the lifetime, costs of which include those
relating to traffic disruption.
•
The possibility of one or more strengthening operations to cater for increased traffic
loading or design code changes, including possible traffic disruption costs.
•
The possibility of bridge modifications or replacement while in use due to widening of
the road carried or crossed, with even greater traffic disruption costs.
•
Cost of in service failure.
Disposal cost.
It follows that bridge economy must be evaluated
for the
entire
life span and any cost
comparisons used by the owner ab-initio must go beyond the estimated initial design and construction
costs. The costing must allow for planned lifetime inspection and maintenance operations, with commuted
costs used to
assist
in the choice between,
say, frequent low cost operations and infrequent more
expensive operations and similar options. Some cost comparisons should also be made for the relative
ease and economics of any future repairs, strengthening or modifications or replacements arising from
road widening.
W.L.C., thus, involves putting the estimated capital, maintenance, operating, demolishing and
replacement costs into a comparable form and coalescing them into a single cost value which recognises
time value of money. The time value of money is explicitly taken into account, and the different operating
costs over a number of years are reduced to a common base line using a financial instrument known
as Present Value Theory (PVT).
Effectively,
it
is possible to reduce the lifetime outgo and income
to a single value
in terms of current cost called Net Present Value (NPV).
Reference to IRC Special Publication 35^ 'Guidelines for Inspection and Maintenance of
Bridges' forms preliminary reading to this document. The need for WLC in the maintenance of bridges
is implicitly addressed in Sections 2.5, 2.9.3, 2.9.5 of Special Publication 35. WLC becomes relevant
to the bridge community when
it is concerned with obtaining the best information on which to make
choices between different forms of construction and different methods of widening or refurbishing
bridge structures. Generally, choices are being made purely on the basis of initial costs without a detailed
reference to maintenance and other costs.
Legitimate concerns facing bridge authorities and owners
are: How long will this particular bridge last? And how much will
it cost to maintain
it say for the
next 30 years or more? WLC can be applied as a tool, at any point of the bridge's life cycle to assess
which
is the least cost option from a range of available maintenance alternatives.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
Undertaking a WLC exercise
for choosing between
alternatives,
will
at the very
least,
emphasize the importance of planning and costing for maintenance/rehabilitation/replacement at the
early design stage, since life cycle costs rather than
initial capital costs alone will form the basis of
evaluation for the owner.
Again designing for WLC
is a matter of resource allocation and deciding
on priorities. Owners have previously tended to disregard the problems of maintenance of structures
because of the lack of a simple method and the uncertainty of evaluations.
It is essential that designers
be aware of the future consequences of present actions.
In the context of a WLC analysis, obvious
implications for building for durability and constructibility not forgetting ease of maintenance, cannot
be over-emphasized.
It
is suggested that bridges be designed that are inspectable, maintainable and
if necessary, modifiable in the future with minimum interruptions to traffic.
1.2.
Fig.l shows the asset
life cycle of a typical public sector project which shows that
except for the project initiation phase, WLC has potential application at every other phase throughout
the
life of the
asset.
Fig.
1. Stages in the asset life cycle of a typical public sector project in which WLC has application^
The paucity of public resources for the construction of new highways or bridges forces
owners to try to squeeze more out of the present infrastructure.
All these focus attention onto devising
maintenance strategies that cause m inimal interruption to traffic and encourage use of WLC models.
WLC can, thus, provide the basis for the most important part of the decision making module in a Bridge
Management System - the financial module.
1.3. The approach brought out in these guidelines is only one of the many approaches available on
Whole Life Costing of Bridges and
it is purely at the discretion of the user whether to adopt the approach
given in these guidelines or not. Further, the probabilistic approach adopted for deterioration modelling is
also not the only approach available for the same and feedback from past experience can be
vital.

2. SCOPE
2.1.
This document provides a direction for evaluating the computed maintenance costs and
to compare alternative designs of bridges either at the tender or design stage.
It will also apply to
alterations to existing structures at a later date.
Whereas, the WLC technique proposed
is generally
applicable to all highway structures,
it may require suitable interpretation of the methodology for major
or unusual structures, e.g., cable-stayed and suspension bridges, movable bridges, steel deck bridges-
and aluminium or timber structures.
To evaluate and compare the costs (including benefits, when they can also be expressed in
monetary terms) of different
alternatives, a financial analysis which
is based on the Whole Life
Approach, that takes into account
all the costs and benefits associated with the bridge structure,
is
addressed
in
this document.
This document emphasizes the need
to develop WLC
to provide
a
framework to assess the financial implications of new construction or alternative construction measures
required to maintain, strengthen and/or widen existing bridges. The assessment of the physical residual
life of the bridge, is an essential input for comparing different repair alternatives using WLC, but this
aspect
is covered in a separate IRC document.
Similarly, in a new construction, the design service
life of the bridge and
its definition are essential inputs.
This document addresses the four levels of
application of WLC, all of which could co-exist:
•
WLC used to aid the decision process for the management of the whole bridge stock
in a road network.
•
WLC used
in the planning stage for a proposed new bridge.
•
WLC used to aid decision making in evaluating foreseeable replacement or maintenance
expenditure of elements of the bridge, within the lifetime of the bridge, e.g., bearings,
waterproof membranes
or joints which
are known
to have
a poorer 'performance
profile' since their design life
is shorter than for other parts of the bridge.
•
WLC used to aid decision making in evaluating unanticipated replacement or maintenance
expenditure of substantial portions of a bridge,
like, superstructures or substructures,
within the
life time of the bridge.
3. APPLICATION OF WLC TO BRIDGE MANAGEMENT
3.1.
General
Due to the limited resources available for maintaining the existing stock of bridges, the owner
is faced with a situation of getting the most for the monies available.
In addition, the task encompasses
allocating resources from a common budget for maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement of the
existing stock of bridges, as also for the construction of new bridges. Faced with a scarcity of available
resources^ the need to prioritize their actions, and justify their ranking of overall bridge expenditure,
through a financiaj technique,
is evident.
3.2. Definition of 'Life' of a Bridge
The
life of 'a bridge can be expressed or defined
in various ways:
•
The design
life of a bridge spart or component.
This can be defined as the probable
time period over which the bridge span or its component is expected to give the intended
level-of-service (Performance) for the designed loads.

•
Economic life of a bridge or any structures. This is the time over which the discounted
value of the structure is adjudged to have reached a somewhat negligible small fraction
of the initial cost of construction, and, therefore, provides an option for replacement
with a
'cost
certificate'.
•
Physical
life of a bridge.
This can be more than the design
life at a lower service
level before the bridge collapses or
is strengthened or demolished.
•
The various uses of the WLC technique for Bridge Management are outlined in the
following sub-sections.
3.3.
Planning and Prioritizing Allocation of Resources for Strengthening/Rehabilitation/
Replacement/Repairs
of Existing Bridge Stock at Network Level
At the national or netv^ork level available resources can be allocated on the basis of an
established ranking of bridges. WLC can be incorporated into the prioritizing procedure (Fig. 2). The
procedure followed in countries where a complete data base of all bridge stock exists
is to rank the
bridges on the basis of their importance, location, traffic density, military need, political sensitivity and
other factors by a valid marking system. At times, a group of bridges along a certain track may qualify
for this ranking in order to better optimise costs. Once the ranking is evaluated, specific rehabilitation
and/or replacement strategy including the 'Do Nothing' option is investigated for the prioritized ranked
bridges. A WLC
is carried out for the chosen ones, not forgetting the possibility of optimizing cost
by grouping.
Often, such grouping reduces cost of diversions, since closure of the road and diverting
traffic through other arterial routes would be one such case. By simultaneously executing the repairs
on all the grouped bridges at one time, cost saving can be meaningfully generated. Following this WLC
operation, the funds available can be allocated in favour of those works where the maximum benefit
is derived by society and the network decision can be taken.
This operation can be substantially
satisfactory if funds are assured and adequate to meet the prioritized repair activity. The entire strategy
can be planned over a reasonable period of time in a ranked sequence so as to give maximum repair
coverage in a planned manner.

3.4.
Choosing between
Alternative's Rehabilitation/Strengthening/Repair Schemes
for an
Existing Bridge
After inspection and evaluation of their load carrying capacity, bridges which are in need of
repair, can be ranked according
to the
criteria
in Section 2.8.4.3 of IRC Special Publication
35.
Alternative repair plans are then considered for the bridge, which
is at the top of the ranking
list.
Selection from among alternative repair plans is based on a WLC analysis including the 'Do Nothing'
options.
The broad guidelines for rehabilitation and strengthening of an existing bridge are dealt with
in Section 2.8.4.2 of IRC Special Publication 35.
It
is implicitly mentioned in Clauses 2.8.4.2
(b)
& (c), that the choice between competing schemes for rehabilitation and strengthening or replacement
be evaluated taking into consideration the future costs and benefits accruing to each option on the
basis of WLC analysis.
3.5.
Comparative Assessment of Design/Construction
Solutions
for a New Bridge
WLC
can
be
used
to make comparative assessments of various
alternative
construction
schemes
at the tender/design stage before a bridge
is built.
All the
life time costs (and benefits)
associated with a particular scheme (refer Section 4) are taken into account and the alternatives are
ranked according to their whole life costs. The construction scheme which results in the least whole-
life cost
is the preferred option for implementation.
Whole life costing
is more often used in the evaluation of Privately Financed Projects of the
Design, Build, Finance and Operate Schemes. The encouragement of private entrepreneurship in the
road development programme and also for specific bridge projects, such as, major bridges with tolls
urban
flyovers and marine causeways,
calls
for
special
care
in addressing the
delicate
interface
between the private entrepreneur and the Government.
Funds generated from profits accruing from
operating revenues (such as, tolls or other such benefits), public safety and acceptable levels of risk,
durability and serviceability levels of the construction during and at hand over and the residual
life
required of the bridge are likely to be assessed somewhat differently when seen through the eyes of
the private entrepreneur and the Government^.
The different permutations of finance, operation and transfer in design and build projects present
a new opportunity in the use of WLC.
Whereas, design standards will have to be met in the interest
of public safety, there will be scope for designers to balance construction and maintenance costs, e.g.,
use of less expensive construction techniques and materials which would tend to maximize subsequent
maintenance costs and vice-versa.
Promoters are more inclined to adopt the
first strategy, namely,
minimum capital cost because they could defer some expenditure to a later stage, when there
is a
steady stream of income in place, and effectively reduce their expenditure in the initial phase which
is financed by expensive borrowings from the public and banks.
This strategy may not necessarily
be acceptable to the owners.
With reference to Fig. 3,
it can be seen that whole
life costs associated with designing for
low first cost followed by high maintenance costs would be lower in present value terms than in non-
discounted terms.
Promoters are likely to adopt Option B and design for a low initial cost followed
by high maintenance costs.
This approach increases risks as
it would result in less durable bridges.
Unexpectedly, expensive maintenance works and difficult to anticipate deterioration mechanisms will

possibly require total closures and consequential loss of revenue.
Inconvenience to motorists caused
by maintenance works will be less important to project promoters than the possible loss of revenue.
This would need to be incorporated in a traffic delay cost model (Appendix B). The political climate
and large variations
in the discount rate during the operating period prior to hand over, are factors
to be accommodated in the financial analysis.
In real practice, the WLC costing strategy for highway schemes in the private sector will be
influenced by:
•
Expected volumes of traffic; good traffic forecasting models are essential.
•
The number of years the route will be operated before
it
is handed over.
•
The specified condition at handing over as set down by the Government.
•
Specified operational and maintenance requirements (with a special emphasis on safety)
as
set down by the Government.
The use of WLC^ by the private sector for financial modelling of BOT schemes
is discussed
and the BOT approach
is
itself presented within the paradigm of risks.
3.6.
WLC
in Evaluating Foreseeable Replacement
All elements of a bridge have different life span and those with relatively poorer 'performance
profiles' will need to be replaced within the designed lifetime of the bridge.
Such replacement or
maintenance expenditure is usually foreseeable and WLC is used to aid decision-making in evaluating
such maintenance expenditure.
The typical elements of limited life span include bearings, joints and
waterproofing membranes.

4. COMPONENTS OF WLC
FOR
BRIDGES
WLC of a highway bridge concerns the evaluation of lifetime costs of construction, operation
(tolls, etc.) maintenance, road user delay and benefits.
The lifetime costs which should be taken into
account are discussed in the following sections. The economic evaluation and ranking of alternative
bridge designs will be at the tender/design stage, and for existing bridges evaluation and ranking will
be for the various rehabilitation alternatives.
The evaluation shall always be in terms of Net Present
Value (NPV).
4.1.
Costs
4.1.1.
Initial costs: The initial costs to be taken into consideration are which envisage costs
of planning, design and construction.
4.1.2.
Post-construction cost:
These will include operation and maintenance costs.
The
post-construction cost covers operational cost, such as, all the costs associated with inspections (access,
labour, equipment and testing), providing services needed for toll collection arrangement and maintenance.
—
All costs incurred on the bridge(s) to keep them
in operation after commissioning
(excluding engineering maintenance cost).
—
Maintenance and inspection which has a bearing on costs (documented^).
—
Strengthening/rehabilitation/repair activities which include structural assessment and
structural repair costs, if these measures aim at restoring the structure to
its original
serviceability.
—
Traffic management costs due to diversion, or traffic regulation costs in the interest
of public safety which are incurred during maintenance.
—
All operating benefits,
like, revenues from tolls, etc.
4.1.3.
Indirect and
other
possible
costs: Road
user
(traffic)
delay
costs
are
seen by
Highway authorities as an indirect cost. Traffic delay costs affect the user and as such are costs for
which
'real' money does not have to be allocated from the available budget.
Various other possible costs which occur during the construction phase, operational phase and
in the event of structure failure, are to be included
in the whole
life cost function. Such costs are
listed in the next Section.
4.1.4.
Costing for environmental impact: WLC
involves the systematic identification of
various events and activities and the manner in which they are carried out throughout the lifetime of
the proposed bridge; a major benefit of adopting WLC
is that
it facilitates costing the impact of each
of the events and activities over the estimated lifetime of the bridge. The environmental costs of various
events and activities associated with bridge execution, operation, demolition, replacement and disposal,
are examples.
4.2.
Cost Function
The above lifetime costs and benefits are brought to a common denominator by discounting
them to their present value as discussed in Section 5.
For working out WLC,
it is essential to define
9



======================================================================

In the above benefits, a portion of the global benefits generated for the road on which the bridge
is
built, are deemed to also accrue for the bridge.
The percentage of benefits of the road that
is
attributed to each bridge,
is worked out on a prorata basis of the initial cost of the bridge versus the
costs of all the bridges on the road.
5. METHODS OF EVALUATION
.
Three
different methods
are available
to evaluate the
financial worth or the
return of an
investment associated with a project or
its various alternatives.
These are simple Payback, Present
Value, Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return.
,
5.1.
Simple Payback
Simple payback
is the time taken for the return on an investment to repay the investment^.
P = Payback period
in years
,
;
I = Capital invested
R = Annual earning
The use of simple payback
is limited by
its result. An evaluation of the acceptable payback
period
is necessary for which no method or criterion
is shown or established. A further drawback
is that
it makes no allowance for the following variables.
Inflation
Interest (payable or received)
Cash flow
Taxation
In the context of whole life costing of bridges, the net present value (NPV) is the most relevant
method which has found universal acceptability and
is described hereunder; a PV analysis precedes
a NPV
assessment.
Before we proceed with NPV analysis,
it
is necessary to understand PV analysis.
5.2.
Present Value
The present value analysis technique involves the calculation of the cost of alternative schemes
in present day monetary terms,
i.e., the amount that is required in today's value to obtain goods
and services at any future date.
This
is based on a simple investment principle.
11



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
A capital or principal (P) invested for (n) years at an interest rate
(r), compounds to a sum
(C) such that:
C =P (1+r)"
Stated in another way the present value (P) of a sum
(C) spent in year (n) at a discount rate
(r)
is:
C
P =
(1+r)"
This is the basis of present value analysis as it allows for the comparison of alternative schemes
on an
equitable
basis.
In general,
the
alternative with the
least present value
is
the preferred
alternative.
Discount rate can be based on Public Lending Rate (PLR),
i.e., the current interest rate on
borrowing. However,
it is normal practice to use 12 per cent as the discount rate in India. The discount
rates currently
in the USA are
10 per cent, Portugal
8 per cent, Germany
3 per cent, Switzerland
2 per cent and elsewhere in developed countries it varies between 6 per cent to 8 per cent.
In Germany,
it
is linked to the national growth rate. The current level of discount rate without any allowance for
inflation, as used by the UK Department of Transport, is currently 8 per cent to the year of construction.
Discount rate can be based on Public Lending Rate (PLR) or on Current Interest Rate on
borrowings.
However,
it
is norma! practice to use 12 per cent considering that
it will reduce in the
future.
Where
there
is
a
large
difference between
the
rate of inflation and
interest,
this can be
accounted by modifying the discount rate
'r' to a net of inflation discount rate (ndr) given by,
/1+ Interest
rate -
1
\
ndr =
X 100 in per cent
terms
\
1+
Inflation rate
/
This method of adjusting future year's costs to allow for interest and inflation (when included)
is called discounting. The technique is called Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). Annuity Tables for ndr
help to ease the calculation.
Fig. 4 shows the relationship between economical residual value of an asset with time for
different discount rates.
It can be noticed that a higher discount rate has the effect of
reducing the
economic or residual value of the structure (asset) at a faster rate. An 8 per cent discount rate lends
to numerically convenient value since it gives a discount factor of 0.1 at 30 years and 0.01 at 60 years.
At a 12 per cent discount rate, the remnant value of the structure reaches 10 per cent of
its original
value
after 20 years.
5.3.
Net Present Value (NPV)
The NPV is defined as the sum of money that needs to be invested today to meet all financial
implication as they arise throughout the
life of the structure.
12

NPV vs. time curves provide a visual representation of the financial performance of competing
options over a range of years as shown

If a period of
ten years
is reckoned as
the
life
of a specific structure or a component of it (e.g. water proofing),
it will be seen that Option A which
has the lowest
capital investment today need not necessarily be more economical than Option B which
has a slightly higher initial investment but a low NPV over this time scale.
If the usable life is taken
as twenty years. Options B and C merit equal choice but since Option B has a lower initial cost,
it

certainly deserves attention.
Option D demands preference over A, B and C although
it is somewhat
higher in first cost. Option C does not merit much attention since it is more expensive than competing
options at all periods of the usable life of thirty years but has a stable NPV. Depending on obsolescence
and time scale chosen, a discrete solution invariably surfaces and invites preference.
The NPV can be negative when costs exceed benefits. However, when comparing alternative
repair schemes at the design stage in which the benefits accruing are likely to be the same, the benefits
may be disregarded.
Similarly,
it is possible to ignore any estimated regular annual maintenance costs
if they are common to all the competing design options.
The use of the discounting method for financial evaluation of competing solutions will provide
a
list of various solutions each with a corresponding NPV (using the same discount rate for each
alternative), similar to that shown in the example below:

The lowest overall-cost NPV option will be project D and would normally be selected.
Ranking of projects on the basis of NPV gives the decision-maker a financial
criteria to
juxtapose with other ranking decisions, such as, Profitability Index, Cost-Effectiveness Index, Cost
Benefit Ratio,
etc.
However, if Profitability Index
is defined as:
Pi = NPV/CC
Project B would yield the largest profitability index
Another useful indicator which may be used to compare alternative repair schemes is the Cost-
Effectiveness Index (CEI). It is calculated for each scheme.
The CEI indicates how well a particular
repair action compares with the 'Do-nothing' option.

In the private sector, the costs used should be net of tax relief because capital expenditure
usually attracts lower tax relief than recurrent expenditure.
Thus,
in the private sector, there may
be preference for structures with low initial costs eventhough the maintenance costs may be higher.
For public sector projects taxation does not enter into the cash flow.
This makes
it easier to
project the cash flow (over the life time), without having to guess at future changes in the tax structure.
Two worked examples with use of above formulae and accompanying commentary are given
in Appendix A.
The first is for choosing between two options for a new bridge at the design stage. The second
example
is for choosing between three options for Repair/Rehabilitation of an existing bridge.
5.4.
Internal Rate of Return
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
is defined as the percentage earned on the amount of capital
invested in each year of the life of the project after allowing for the repayment of the sum originally
invested'.
This method while used,
is not particularly amenable to public sector construction since
it
assumes that an investment will generate an income.
It also assumes reinvestment at the IRR.
In
construction firm, nearly
all cash flows are outward and there may be no guarantees of stable
re-
investment levels.
However, IRR is used in financial models in the context of BOT projects in the private sector^.
5.5.
Other Possible Ranking Decisions
Other ranking decisions may be more subjective, such as':
Prestige
:
the impression: the project gives to the corporate image.
Future
:
potential: future changes and fall back plans.
Longevity
:
the intended
life span of the project.
6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
While the mathematical model developed to carry out WLC would be rational and provides
an auditable result, sensitivity analysis should be undertaken in order to assess the effects of variability
in the uncertain parameters (or assumptions) over which the owner has least confidence or control.
Thus, the sensitivity of the calculations to changes in such parameters will help to arrive at a range
of present value costing.
Engineering judgement in conjunction with other decision criteria are then
used to arrive at the final decision.
In general, an alternative with a low NPV, which
is also least
sensitive to uncertain parameters, justifies selection.
The problem that WLC faces when applied to longlife structures (bridges), is the appropriateness
of any particular discount rate and the significant incidence and cost of repairs.
Moreover, only a
few parameters can be predicted with certainly due to the increasing nature of risk associated with
increase in time. The extent of these problems are such that rather than take one unique answer from
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
the WLC calculations, sensitivity analysis should be used to arrive at a range of costing by varying
the input parameters by a fixed percentage from
their estimated value, and the results compared
thereafter.
Financial parameters for bridges which are sensitive to the decision-making process and
'\p
for which sensitivity analysis should be carried out are:
'
-
Cost
Residual
life and value
Discount rate (includes the effects of inflation, consider a range between 8 per cent
to
15 per cent, due to the uncertainty
in predicting future economic trends).
Life cycle (not greater than 30 years).
Benefits to agency and the
user.
;^
In addition, sensitivity analysis may also be undertaken with regard to the possible financial
implications of:
Changes to the maintenance interval,
i.e., the frequency of maintenance.
Duration of maintenance activity.
Possible changes to the road network.
Variations in the envisaged future growth in traffic.
Alterations to the prediction of remaining life of the bridge or a component of the
bridge, due to adopting/carrying out
specific repair strategy.
The sensitivity of future cost analysis can be developed for future values of the following^:
Discount rate
-
, Inflation rate
„.
i^
Initial cost
Inspection costs
Maintenance
costs
Repair costs
Bridge deterioration rate
Probability of structural collapse
Traffic volume
Detoured traffic volume
Despite all these exercises, a political decision which precipitates a crisis, such as, the 1973
petrol rate hike by OPEC, would affect the results and the need to revise and update the available
discount rate data becomes necessary.
While such extreme occurrences being random and rare
in
occurrence are difficult to project, they can happen and have happened.
6.1.
Examples
of Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is best illustrated graphically.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
Fig. 6 shows the variation of net present costs with the asset life (a single variate analysis).
It is presumed that net present costs do not vary with any other parameter and that the discount rate,
in particular, is the same for all alternatives. The life-costs of all alternatives vary with the time scale.
It can be seen that the time horizon adopted (life cycle period considered) in the analysis
is crucial
to the ranking alternative on the basis of least net present costs.
Whereas,
initially the cost of all
alternatives are sensitive to the time horizon considered, with increasing time the net present costs
are less sensitive as indicated by the reduction in slope of the curves. Alternative A
is ranked higher
than alternative B, and
this ranking
is not sensitive to asset
life as alternative A
is always more
economical than alternative B. However, alternative A
is only economical for products compared to
alternative C.
Fig. 6. Example of a single variate sensitivity analysis'
Fig. 7, illustrates a bivariate analysis in which the net present costs for a particular alternative
(say Alternative C from Fig. 6 which has the lowest net present costs over the
life period) vary with
asset life in conjunction with the discount rate.
At any given time net present costs vary to a greater
extent with time.
The high discount rate of 20 per cent tends to dampen the variation in net present
costs with increasing time.
The above inferences are
illustrated
in greater detail
in the Figs. 8 &
9.
Fig. 8 shows the results from an analysis of two structures. A has a cheaper initial cost but
gradually becomes more expensive over time in terms of NPV as the
life of the project continues.
The centre line dictates the optimum solution in each case and is bordered by a band which represents
the sensitivity
of the calculation to the variables.
This band broadens with time as unknown impact
on the solution.
It can be seen from the outer two distinct areas which structure should be built and
a third, middle or 'intermediate' period where the ranges of variables are such that either A or B could
be said to be viable within the limits of sensitivity analysis using assumed multiples of variables. The
slope of the line
is dictated by the size of the discount factor applied. A low discount factor results

in a steeply sloping line. A high discount factor results in a less steep line, extending the time scale
during which the calculated balance point is achieved and increases the intermediate period, as shown
in Fig.
9. A view could be taken that
it
is sensible not to invest additional funds now which could
be invested elsewhere.
When the return
is at such an investment drop, the lowest - cost selection
system will tend to prevail on high discount - factor projects.
Such analysis help to identify the critical parameters (or assumptions) which underpin the cash
flow forecast.
They provide the means to test the sensitivity to forecast variations in the uncertain
values of parameters (or assumptions). Rather than a single answer, a range of relative costing outputs
need
to be assessed before a final decision
is made.
Despite sensitivity analysis, high interest, high inflation and uncertain funding availability, may
cause erroneous influence over the long term predictions and render the working unstable.
For this
purpose, the analysis needs to be frequently updated and options re-evaluated, in order to route a most
favourable solution under a set of prevailing circumstances and fresh anticipations.
This approach
will
become more stable once fairly settled conditions prevail and market prices are steady, e.g., as
in Japan, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A.

7. STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO THE USE OF WLC
The step-by-step approach to the use of WLC, as appropriate to bridges,
is as under:
Step
1:
Identify the objectives, constraints and
alternatives to the whole life costing
exercise
•
The objective
is to minimise the whole
life costs or to choose the alternative,
which results in the least WLC from a range of alternative schemes. WLC will
be used to optimise and justify the financial decision.
•
The constraints could be a limited budget and also recognition of the fact that
subjective issues might influence the ranking of alternatives which are otherwise
based on a purely financial decision.
Step 2
:
Establish the basic assumptions and determine the whole life costing procedure
to
be adopted
•
The NPV method
is recommended for applying WLC to Bridges
Step 3
: Compile
all
the necessary data
•
Most important financial parameters are:
Discount rate
Whole
life period
in years
The most important components of life time costs for bridges stock are:
Construction
Maintenance
Operational
Road user
(traffic) delay costs
Environment management costs
Where benefits are envisaged over the time period which reduce costs, and can be expressed
in financial terms, they should be taken
into account and discounted to their net present value.
Step
4:
Compute and discount the whole life costs for each alternative using the NPV
method
Comparisons must be made
in the
light of the assumptions that underpin the
analysis.
Use can be made of spreadsheets or suitably modified proprietary software.
Step
5;
Compare the
results
Prioritise the actions needed to be taken
Rank the alternatives
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 64
======================================================================
RC:SP:6 1-2004
Step
6:
Evaluate the
results
for uncertainty by means of sensitivity
analysis
•
Arrive at a range of costing which shows the variation of NPV against time
for a given scheme, or for the different alternatives under consideration, by
varying the parameters for the WLC analysis within a suitable range.
•
Engineering judgement should be exercised to choose the option for implementation.
An awareness of uncertainly and rick which
is endemic to whole life costing in
the construction industry will need to be displayed (introducing WLC within the
context of an effective
risk management system
is beyond the scope of the
present document).
Step-7:
Report on
the
findings and
conclusions
•
Where costs only are considered without consideration to benefits, the least NPV
option
is adopted.
•
Where
costs and
benefits
are considered,
a positive NPV
indicates
that the
benefits
are greater than the
costs.
•
Where costs and benefits are considered,
a
negative NPV
indicates that the
proposed project, if taken-up, would yield a return, which is lower than the cost
of capital to the owner.
Unless the project can be justified on the grounds of
some
other
essential
criteria
(e.g.,
strategic,
defence,
etc.)
it should
not be
implemented.
8. WLC AND MANAGEMENT
In bridge management, WLC may be implemented as a management tool and invoked intermittently
as a management system in which a continuum approach can be adopted throughout the lifetime
the bridge.
8.1.
WLC
as
a Management Tool
When used to plan expenditure in the public sector,
it can be expected that whole life costing
1 be used for capital expenditure decisions only. As a management tool
it can also be used at any
e during the life cycle to minimise bridge management costs.
In this approach, the WLC technique
1 only be used intermittently throughout the life cycle of the bridge in order to minimise costs. As
lanagement
tool, WLC
can
be used
most
effectively
to choose from
a range of repair and
ibilitation alternatives for a highway structure.
8.2.
WLC
as
a Management System
The approach
is
to
introduce a continuum of WLC
from
the
capital planning
stage
to
ational maintenance, so that if at any time the actual costs are proving different from the budgeted
a lesson can be learnt and future budgets modified in sufficient time. Used
in this way WLC
nes more effective, the estimates more realistic and costs can genuinely be controlled.
All the separate stages in the application of WLC over the bridge's life cycle need to be linked
budgetary mechanism to create the desired continuum. Thus, when used as a management system,
:-up which estimates the future costs and the set-up which is responsible for spending the money
22



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 64
======================================================================
lRC:SP:61-2004
could be referenced on the basis of WLC*.
This approach necessarily implies the development of
a culture in which managements take on responsibility for the bridges under their control.
It is obvious
that such a working system would lead to better quality control and quality assurance methods being
adopted.
The use of WLC as a management decision system
is best addressed within the framework
of a Bridge Management System (BMS), in which a cradle-to-grave approach
is necessarily adopted
for all the maintenance work of the existing and new bridgework.
For an introduction to BMS and
the roll of WLC
within a BMS^'^.
As part of a BMS, WLC provides a continuum approach in which
it
is used to help plan the
prioritisation/ranking of bridges. As part of the decision making module of the BMS,
it is best suited
for choosing from a range of possible projects or for choosing from various alternative repair schemes
within a single project. BMS
is further discussed in Section 8.3.
8.3.
Bridge Management System
With increasing road and highway infrastructure in place, the relative cost of maintenance and
repair of existing bridges has been steadily growing. The problem facing bridge authorities worldwide
is the need to balance available resources for new and existing bridges and
maintenance costs,
in
a given time frame (budget time period).
This requires prioritization of actions. As a consequence,
management systems for bridges have been adopted
in many countries.
The development of a BMS
is a major event and the following are meant to complement the
already existing guidelines in IRC Special Publication 35^.
Bridges need to be managed throughout their service
life and the BMS does that by:
•
Storing all the design, construction and field inspection data in a database.
•
Standardizing procedures and reports in the form ofQ&A software. This is to generate
data in respect of personnel, equipment and previous inspections.
Also, to track the
processing of the reports from standpoint of quality control and on-time completion.
•
Helping in decision-making.
The decision system
is divided into-
A non-structural in-expensive work to keep the bridges functionality upto the
designed level (routine maintenance).
Prime structural works to improve the present capacity performance of the bridge
(non-routine maintenance).
•
Involving multi-criteria decision-making tools in overall decision modelling.
Primarily, a BMS must be appropriate
to the prevailing
state of engineering
practice, apart from being cost effective to implement and maintain. Preference
should be given to adopting/developing a computerized form of a
BMS.i A
commonly used database
software (Microsoft
Access),
corresponds
the
core
bridge inventory module with other decision modules being added as shown) in
Fig. 10.
This will allow various forms of
'query' to be posed to the BMS. in
the form of filters, and the
outcome of these questions can be used either for

The successful development and use of a BMS for the
inspection of a large number of bridges in Florida by a consulting company'^.
It is appropriate to start with a simple BMS and gradually increase its sophistication
as required with time, instead of adopting a complex BMS which might take several
years to implement and operate at its full capacity, in view of the substantial input
information not being readily available^"^.
Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), UK, have recently developed such an
amenable computerised BMS.
It comprises a central bridge inventory module to
which are tied a relatively simple
Markov model [Appendix D] for predicting
the future deterioration rate and condition state (i.e. a durability module), as well
as a financial module based on WLC to help rank the cost effectiveness of various
bridge repair options.
Needless to say that the bridge inventory database, the Markov model and the
maintenance cost databases must be continuously updated on the basis of future
inspection reports. From such stored data,
deterioration rates can be derived from
changes in condition state with time, data on the cost of maintenance options can
be extracted from stored information on past maintenance work, improvement in
condition state following maintenance as well as useful life of maintenance systems
can be
assessed^^.

A three-level system methodology for a computerised BMS is a reliable administrative
tool.
In such a system
which employs
a closed loop procedure to address
budgetary and
strategic concerns
at the
national,

local
levels,
is
addressed.
The three
level bridge rehabilitation and replacement management
selection module, utilizes general wide-selection criteria applied to the full bridge
inventory for that region, as extracted from the central data base maintained by
the National Bridge Authority. Specific local criteria, regarding particular structures
are taken into account at the local level taking full advantage of local engineering
and planning knowledge about candidate bridge projects.
This is feedback to the
national level, thus ensuring valuable local and district level staff participation in
the decision-making process.
The basic system design and common data base
could be used by any State
in the country with any existing bridge stock.

This approach can be applied to national, district and local levels by choice.
The system
is a good starting point for developing the basic maintenance, rehabilitation, and
replacement sub-module within a BMS on a national and state-wise basis. A full BMS would cover
the organization of bridge planning, design, construction, maintenance, evaluation, and research together
with interaction with other infrastructure management systems, such as, that for pavements.
Such
an implementation of a BMS would be the ideal structure for evaluating the contributions made from
techniques, materials, and systems designed to extend the
life of bridges in the overall context of a
nation's transport infrastructure.
9. PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING
AND USING WLC FOR BRIDGES
In general, what
is needed for the bridge industry
is a WLC approach to the purchase cost,
maintenance cost, running cost, in-service failure cost, and the demolition and disposal cost associated
with the structure.
With respect to estimating whole life costs for bridges, the following difficulties are currently
envisaged:
Difficulty in predicting bridge deterioration and the residual
life and hence long-term
maintenance
costs.
Difficulty in predicting long-term growth in traffic and hence traffic delay costs.
Uncertainty in discount rate, inflation rate, etc.
Difficulty in using subjective and qualitative criteria, which influence overall decision-
making and which cannot be suitably expressed in monetary terms.
Likely external influences altering resource allocation, ranking/prioritization established on
the basis of WLC.
Difficulty in predicting long-term economic conditions.
Difficulty in assessing the life of various repairs and rehabilitation options.
10. STEPS REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTING WLC IN BRIDGES
In Section 6 of IRC Special Publication 35^ some of the key allied areas of research and
development aspects for bridge maintenance are identified. The section also highlights the need to
'study the economics of maintenance of bridges of various ages and types', thereby making an implicit
reference
to WLC.
A suitable framework to facilitate the use of WLC for bridge management is a pre-requisite
in the following developmental referrals:
•
A database of national bridge stock and their condition. The database to include increase
bridge defects and maintenance, repair and strengthening costs.
•
A
bridge
deterioration model on
the
basis
of Markov
probabilistic
process
(Appendix
D).
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6 1-2004
A database of appropriate standard cost figures for bridge maintenance works and service
lifes.
In this context, suppliers of patented repair materials and techniques must be encouraged
to provide a whole life cost for their products with special emphasis on guaranteed
life
expectancy of the repaired option using their product.
Guidelines which set-out national procedures and methodology for bridge assessment,
rating and deterioration monitoring.
In this context, an 'Assessment Version' of the Bridge Code needs to be developed as
distinct form the 'Standard' Bridge Code.
A model to predict road user (traffic) delay costs.
This might be done by making appropriate modifications to a model similar to the computerized
model QUADRO used
in the U.K. (Appendix
B).
The following need to be considered in the development of a Traffic Delay Cost Model:
Traffic type, capacity and flow-rate
Sequence, number, timing and methodology of lane closures; working out and posting
of vehicle speed and weight restrictions
Length and quality of diversion
Application of model to rural and/or urban areas or otherwise
Application of model to
all categories of highways or otherwise
Application of model to major and/or minor bridges or otherwise
Hybrid maintenance schemes in which the bridge and the associated length of highway
are both simultaneously closed during periods of future maintenance to minimise traffic
delay costs.
In such cases, depending on the circumstances, a major portion of the
future traffic delay costs could be allocated to the highway/road as compared to the
bridge
A single-lane closure or restriction of the carriageway might have the impact of
demanding the simultaneous maintenance of a
series of bridges/flyovers
in close
proximity, thus causing traffic delay costs to be apportioned equally to all the bridges
in the series. For heavily used routes, maintenance, including painting of steel bridges/
elements, should be carried out at night time. However, in assessing the traffic delay
costs,
it may be necessary
to
ascertain whether
it
is required
to maintain some
carriageway restrictions during the daytime, which inturn would cause increase in
journey time, vehicle operating costs and Queuing
Appropriate traffic forecasting models
In the context of construction of major National Highways, and keeping
in mind the
phenomenal annual expected growth
in traffic volumes at the current rate of 20-36 per
cent,
its significance
is self-evident
27



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 64
======================================================================
Appropriate economic forecasting models
These to take into account a construction price index (CPI), as distinct from a retail price
index. The CPI to reflect the real financial environment within the construction industry
and help the average cost of capital for construction to be more realistically incorporated
in the discount rate
Adoption of a realistic discount rate
However, for the present an indicative Test Discount Rate (including inflation) of 7 per
cent can be assumed and a sensitivity analysis undertaken for a variation in the discount
rate of between 8-15 per cent, to arrive at a range of costing on which a decision can
be taken. This action for evaluating alternative maintenance schemes for new and for
the repair of existing bridges.
(It
is
likely
that on
the basis of the present Indian economy, and an assessment of
its future economic trend, a 12 per cent discount rate with a time horizon of 30 years
could prove
to
be
appropriate for bridges
in
the Indian
context).
Adoption of a computerized BMS to greatly facilitate the move towards WLC for bridges,
as WLC
is central to the prioritizing/ranking process.
Whereas, adopting a WLC approach is conditional to spending more on initial feasibility
and detailed design costs,
it is nonetheless justifiable on the grounds that such an approach
will give much better long term value for money and must, therefore, be encouraged.
Maximum benefit from the WLC approach for bridges will be obtained by incorporating
it as a part of a comprehensive Bridge Management System with the focus on a rolling,
medium-term maintenance strategy.
There
is
also
a
clear case
for adopting
a simple BMS and
gradually
increasing
its
sophistication with time, as compared with adopting a complex BMS at the outset with
consequent delays in implementation.
Further research/development work and data-base preparation as an index for probabilistic
deterioration prediction and related cost studies, are pre-requisite to enhance the use of
WLC in decision-making, and for the development of a Bridge Management System.

SAMPLES OF WHOLE LIFE COSTING FOR BRIDGE PROJECTS
Example
1:
Whole Life Costing to choose between 2 options for a New Bridge at the Design
Stage
A three span continuous concrete slab carrying a dual two-lane all-purpose carriageway with
footpaths
is to be built.
Two possible options are available: a composite steel beam with concrete
deck or an 'all-concrete' deck. A whole life cost approach will determine the option to be adopted.
The use of spreadsheets shown in Tables
1 and 2 greatly facilitate this comparison; the bridge
properties are entered
in the shaded portions.
The bridge element, area/length/number of each elements; and their capital cost are entered
in the first three columns respectively in the spreadsheets.
The capital costs are based on prevailing
costs
in the construction market.
Similarly, the repair/replacement rates and costs and expected life before replacement are
entered
in Columns
5, 6 &
7.
The figures for piers, steel beams and concrete deck are taken from historical records.
The
remaining figures are gathered from various sources but cannot be regarded as authoritative.
A assumed expected long term
inflation rate of 8 per cent and a long-term market cost
of capital
(interest rate of 13.5 per cent) are used to calculate the discount rate as under:
The repair/replacement rate is obtained by multiplying the repair/replacement cost with the

The Net Present Value for a typical bridge element is calculated based upon the formula given
below:
Where,
N
=
Whole life period considered
C
=
Capital cost
t
=
Year in which the expenditure
is envisaged
r
=
Discount rate
in per cent
The years
to be considered
(t)
is obtained by dividing
life before replacement for that
particular element by the design
life of the bridge (N).
In this example N=120 years.
For example, the NPV for 'Bearings', for the concrete bridge option in Table
1
at today's
Capital Cost of Rs. 4, 12,500 and life replacement every 25 years, with a whole life period of 120 years
is given below:
.rr^r,

(1 + 5.09%)'°
(1 + 5.09%)''
(l + 5.09%)'
= 1,622,650
Note that the
initial capital cost (n=0)
is also part of this NPV calculation.
It
is interesting to compare the percentage cost of each bridge element in terms of capital
cost and Net Present Value.
This
is facilitated by Pie Charts for each of the options.
The results
appear to back-up intuitive understanding that replacement of
'soft' bridge elements, like, bearing,
expansion joints and waterproofing membranes figure much larger in whole life costs than in capital
costs.
This
is not surprising, as these require more work
in removal and replacement and require
possibly more frequent replacements during the
life of the bridge.
It is clear that the composite steel and concrete bridge option has a Net Present Value that
is greater than the concrete bridge option.
The concrete bridge option with the lower NPV
is
the preferred
option.
Sensitivity Analysis can be carried out.
(1)
By varying the expected long-term inflation and the long-term market cost of capital
to generate discount rate for values other than what has been adopted in this specific
example:
8 per cent,
13.5 per cent and 5.09 per cent respectively.
(2)
By varying repair/replacement rates over a range to study the effect of various repair
and replacement
strategies.
(3)
By varying the design
life of 120 years.
(4)
By varying the life expectancy for one or many bridge elements and observing the effect
on the repair/replacement options.

Example
2i
Whole Life Costing to choose between 3 options for the Repairs and Rehabilitation
for an
Existing Bridge
The example
is for the selection of the most economical option for a deck rehabilitation
project.
The time frame to be considered is 50 years from the date of inspection. The project engineer
has inspected the bridge.
He has gathered further from historical records the following
life cycles
for various repair treatments.
(1)
Deck replacement
50 Years
(2)
Rehabilitation - patch, waterproof and pave
15 Years
(3)
Milling and replacing top coat of asphalt
15 Years
(4)
Replace waterproofing and asphalt
30 Years
(5)
Physical residual life without rehabilitation (Do Nothing)
5 Years
* He has, therefore, concluded that he has
3 options available to him as under:
Option
(1)
:
Immediate rehabilitation: patch, waterproof and pave and thereby extend the
useful
life of the deck by
15 years,
after which replace the deck. In year
30 clean and replace the top asphalt and
in year 45 replace waterproofing
and asphalt; replace deck a second time in year 65 from date of inspection.
Do nothing now and replace the deck, waterproof and pave
in 5 years,
at
the end of the useful
life of the bridge.
In year 20 clean and replace the
top asphalt surfaces.
In year 35 replace waterproofing and asphalt; replace
the deck
in year 55 from date of inspection.
Replace the deck now, waterproof and pave.
In year 15 clean and replace
the top asphalt.
In the year 45 clean and replace top asphalt surface; replace
deck
in year 50.

Residual Life and Value
The various alternatives considered may have useful lives at the end of the time frame. This
is termed as the 'Residual Life'.
There is no precise method of assessing this. A thorough knowledge
of the performance of past rehabilitation inputs and experienced engineering judgement,
is probably
the best way of assessing the useful residual
life.
From the residual
life of elements the 'Residual
Value' of the structure
is calculated.
There are several methods available for calculating the residual value. The method used here
is the
2"*^ cycle replacement method.
Let us consider two options say options (1) and
(3).
Let the
2"^^ replacement of option (1) be nl, years
and
2"'' replacement of option (3) be n3 years nl > n3
Option (3) will be the base case.

Appendix-B
TRAFFIC DELAY COST MODEL WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO QUADRO
For a model for iindiscounted traffic delay costs or road user delay costs (for example along the
lines of QUADRO software used
in the UK^'), the following census needs to be undertaken
:
•
Traffic type, capacity and flow rate
•
Sequence, number, timing and methodology of lane closures; working out and posting of
vehicle speed and weight restrictions
•
Length and quality of diversion
•
Structure of model: rural and/or urban areas or otherwise
•
Structure of model:
all categories of highways or otherwise
•
Structure of model: major and/or minor bridges or otherwise
•
Hybrid maintenance schemes in which the bridge and the associated length of highway are
both simultaneously closed during periods of future maintenance will lead to savings in traffic
delay costs.
In such cases, depending on the circumstances, a major portion
of the future
traffic delay costs could be allocated to the highway/road as compared to the bridge.
•
A single-lane closure or restriction of the carriageway might have the impact of demanding
the simultaneous maintenance of a series of bridges/flyovers in close proximity, thus causing
traffic delay costs to be apportioned equally to
all the bridges in the series.
For heavily
used routes, maintenance, including painting of steel bridges/elements, are carried out at night
time. However, in assessing the traffic delay costs,
it may be necessary to ascertain whether
it
is required to maintain some carriageway restrictions during day time as well.
•
Vehicle delay costs must recognise:
•
Increase in journey time
•
Vehicle operating costs (labour, fuel, vehicle maintenance, etc.)
•
Queing
THE QUADRO SYSTEM
•
In order to operate, the QUADRO requires a network. This comprises of the main
route on which the works are to take place and a representative diversion route, together
with the traffic flows for both routes.
It also requires details regarding the length of
works
site,
its location on the main route
in relation to the diversion route and the
duration, timing, and traffic management and other arrangements at each site. Works
sites can be specified either individually or as a series of sites.
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:6i-2004
For each job, QUADRO
calculates
the extra user costs due
to the presence of works,
allowing for traffic transfer to the diversion route.
The programme then discounts the cost
from the year the
site
is closed to a chosen present value year.
The discounted costs of
each job are summed to a total discounted cost
for the profile.
This
is carried out for both
'low
' and
'high' traffic and economic growth scenarios.
For economic decision making,
the preferred option
is that with the lowest present value of costs.

FUTURE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WLC, RISK AND

Reliability and Risk, Develop
Risk-Based Framework
for screening, evaluation, ranking, prioritization of bridges needing repairs/remedial
action.
Develop Multi-Criteria Decision making tools.
Include, when appropriate, the above within the framework of an overall Bridge
Management System (BMS)

C.L Uncertainty and Risk
Risk

Risk== Probability of Failure x Consequence
Structural reliability techniques'^ are used for evaluating the probability of failure, Pf, of a
bridge/bridge component.
As shown
in Fig.
12, probability density functions for loads S (demand
requirement) and resistance R (supply capacity) are required which are arrived
at on the basis of
statistical analysis of existing data.
The scope of WLC can be extended as per the following:

IRC:SP:6 1-2004
General guidelines concerning the modelling and management of risk issues are to be found^^:
The consequences of failure should be evaluated with regard to the following:
Human:
health and safety, exposure to hazard, and the potential loss of life and injury
Environmental:
damage to the environment
<
Traffic: disruption to traffic, as road user costs
Economic: disruption to the economy, loss of assets, and economic losses
Business: with respect to funding, rebuilding/repair costs, private investment,
etc.
The systematic application of risk techniques involves the probabilistic evaluation of exposure
to various perceived 'Hazard' scenarios with full or partial failure consequences, and also a value for
the cost of loss of human
life or injury.
A risk based approach in which the probability of a bridge/network closure forms the central
issue can be used to provide the framework for the three main activities related to bridge management,
namely, economic appraisal, load assessment, inspection/maintenance.

Risk Based Assessment and
Prioritisation
of Bridges
for Remedial Work
The methodology involves^
Screening of bridges based on condition surveys.
Standard load assessment using an assessment version of a national bridge standard
(IRC and ISI).
Load testing may also be used to rate the bridges.
Risk assessment of sub-standard bridges, which do not meet assessment criteria.
Ranking of bridges in terms of risk.
Design of remedial actions for each bridge.
Prioritization of bridges for the optimal allocation of resources for remedial work on
different bridges.

[16], [21] and
[17].
C.4. Risk-Based Maintenance Planning
The concepts of structural reliability developed'^ can be extended to maintenance issues.
For a bridge/network of bridges the maintenance strategy would be based on the optimum
set of repairs for which the total bridge/network risk
is a minimum.
A risk based method can form the overall framework of an effective inspection/maintenance
strategy with a view to reducing the operational costs and improving the structural integrity of bridges.
This can be achieved by optimizing the inspection frequency and maintenance
strategy, by using
techniques
in which the
structural reliability of deteriorating structures
is kept above a minimum
acceptable
level.
A
reliability
- based maintenance plan
involves assuming (preferably deriving)
a target
probability of failure, which should not be exceeded. With reference to Fig. 13 when the target value
is likely to be exceeded, maintenance/repair is called for to keep the
P^. below the target value. Such
interventions effectively increase the service
life of the bridge/bridge component. The maintenance
interval between interventions which affect the frequency of inspections also be observed.

,
MODELLING BRIDGE DETERIORATION ON THE BASIS OF
w
MARKOV PROCESS
D.l. Background Introduction
to Bridge Deterioration
In order to plan and prioritize future maintenance works,
it is required to postulate a model
that can predict the state of deterioration-type of deterioration, and the rate that is likely to develop
in bridge structures. An optimal long-term bridge maintenance policy can be developed if the rate of
deterioration of various components can be predicted.
Bridges deteriorate due to various mechanisms, like, Alkali Silicate-Reaction fatigue, corrosion
of steel reinforcement and steel members, carbonation, weld failures, delamination of concrete, etc.
These mechanisms rarely occur in isolation and different mechanisms may be active at the same time
or at different stages in the life of a bridge.
Although, deterioration
is a continuous process in time,
the nature of deterioration
is such that
it becomes
'visible' or first noticed in the structure after a
passage of ten to fifteen years from the time
it was built.
The amount and type of deterioration evidenced depends on a number of factors, such as,
•
Design quality and craftsmanship standards of original construction.
•
Type of construction-steel, composite, concrete, prestressed concrete, etc. and various
permutations of these types
in different kinds of bridges.
•
Type of traffic - Designed and Current. Increased traffic intensity and volume, vehicle
speeds and axle loads accelerate the declamation process.
•U-.
Environment
in which the bridge
exists, hot marine environments being the most
aggressive.
•
Past maintenance actions.
Since there are various materials used for bridge construction and various components of
a bridge are also made of different materials, deterioration modelling is based on the deterioration of
individual components rather than of the entire bridge.
It becomes immediately apparent that there are considerable uncertainties involved in modelling
deterioration, not least of which are a lack of historical data and even where such data exists,
it may
be of debatable quality or be inadequate requiring some form of extrapolation.
Despite on-going
research worldwide, a rigorous analytical model for estimating deterioration in bridge components due
to the various deterioration mechanisms,
is yet to be developed for direct use in assessing the long-
term durability of a bridge.
In view of the above, a time-dependant probabilistic model
is envisaged for bridge
deterioration. The model must follow from a relatively simple concept and be capable of being fine
tuned and up-dated with time on the basis of assessed deterioration and information inferred from
inspection records as they become available.

D.2. Probabilistic Markov Model
for Bridge Deterioration
The parameters required for the Markov Model are developed directly from observations
on the deterioration of a number of nominally identical bridge components.
The deterioration model
will provide a probabilistic estimate of the rate of deterioration for a particular component of the bridge.
Maintenance actions modify the deterioration of the component and this is reckoned. The model will
help to evaluate the probability that a component will be in a particular state at a future point
in time given that the present condition of the component and the future maintenance policy
are known.
After estimating the level of deterioration at some future time
't', a WLC analysis can be
used to cost the likely future maintenance for a given type of bridge element.
Deterioration modelling
is attracting research and development interests around the world^''^-^.
The following assumptions are made when adopting the Markov approach.
•
Bridge components are grouped according to type
(e.g., bearings, expansion joints,
prestressed concrete, T-Beams predominantly
in flexure,
etc.)
•
Suitable
'condition states
' are definedfor each component.
Although, deterioration
is a continuous process, the condition of a particular bridge
component
is expressed
relatively according to a numerical scale.
Whereas, the scale may vary from country
to CQuntry, a typical scale in which the Condition Points or Condition Ratings varies
from
1
(insiginifcant) to
5 (serious) can be adopted.
The annual probability of the
component remaining
in the same
state or deteriorating to other states also require
definition. Fig. 15 shows the evolution of the conditional probabilities (sum of probabilities
=
1
at any discrete time) for a particular bridge element category as the component

decays with time.
Each condition state
is discrete and given by the aggregated value
ofthe inspection points shown in circles. The probabilities associated with the component
r
deteriorating to different condition states
in the future
is identified between yearly
V
intervals.
,
•
Whilst the states and probabilities adopted by the model are to be initially chosen based
-
'
f
on 'expert' opinion (i.e., subjective judgement of experienced inspectors), they can be
-
'
^
updated using Bayesian inference techniques from the results of periodic inspection
i
'
records as they become available.
•
Whilst the Markov approach is amenable for implementing in the short-term,
it is also
possible to include Markov deterioration modelling in the long-term within the context
of an overall
risk based management system
(currently,
risk issues require further
research and development)^^.
D.S.Basic Probabilistic Equations and Scope
Let X
(t) denote the 'condition
state' of a component at time.
Suppose the entire history of the
'condition states' of the component has been monitored,
finding that,
r
X(l) = xi, X(2) = X2
X(t) = Xt
Then the probability that the next value of the condition process, X(t+1) will equal any
particular value xt +1, given
its entire history,
is
"
P [X(t+l)=Xt^i
I (X(l) =xi) I(X(2)=X2) I...I(X(t) = x^)]
The above equation represents a stochastic process, intact the Markov process. The deterioration
of a number of bridge components can be reasonably assumed to be 'path independent' and the future
behaviour depends only on
its present state and not
its past history,
i.e., the deterioration process
is
memoryless. The deterioration of the component in the next time step will depend only on its present
condition and not on the entire history of deterioration, and the Markovian equation can be re-written
as,
P[X(t+l) = Xt^l |X(t) =x^]
Let the condition states be discretely defined on the basis of condition points as K=1,2,3...L
Then the probability that the process
is
in state
I
at time step
t
is expressed
as,
qi
(t) = P [X(t)=i]
A discrete Markov process is referred to as a Markov Chain (Benjamin and Cornell, 1970)
and can be described by two parameters.
(1)
the distribution of the condition states ql, for a particular bridge component at time (t),
i.e., the state
in which the system was
at time zero.
qi (O) =P [X (o) =i]
for all
i
46

(2)
the transition probabilities pij (t), expressed in the form of a matrix, giving the conditional
probabilities that the process will be in state j at time
/ given that
it was in state / at
the previous
step.
Py
(t) =P[X (tH IX(t-l)=j] for all
i, j pairs
In general the transition probabilities will be functions of time.
For most types of bridge
components an older component and a newer component, which are in the same condition at present,
are equally likely to transit to a next inferior state if no maintenance action
is taken.
Therefore, for
a given type of bridge component,
it
is reasonable to assume that the transition probabilities are
independent of the age of the component and this renders the Markov process homogenous with time
and the transition probabilities are simply written as P^.
The two model parameters have to be derived for each type of bridge component from a
statistical analysis of the available data on the condition of each type of component. Where such data
are not readily available (inferred from historical trends) they can be taken based on the subjective
judgement of experienced inspectors.
The model can then be updated based on future inspection
results.
From the 1x1 matrix of transition probabilities for a homogeneous Markov chain the k-step
matrix^*^^ of transition probabilities Py
can be derived as
P..(k)=
Z
P. ^""^V-
^
ij
Mr
^
rj
r=l
or
rf'' = n*""n=n"
Thus, for any time step
t, the
Py^*^^ gives the conditional probability that the process will
be
in
state /
k steps
later, given that
it
is
in
state
/
at step
t.
If the present condition of a bridge component is known from inspection, the probability of
the component deteriorating to any other condition after k time steps can be determined from the above
relationship.
If the initial state probabilities qj (0) are known then the unconditional probability that
the component will be
in any particular state
j
at any particular time
t
can be conveniently be
obtained as-
t
qj(t)= i:c,^V^
r=l
q(t) = q(0)rf^n = q(0)rf
In general, the transition probabilities will be a function of future maintenance actions on
the component. For a set of feasible maintenance actions on the component, the Markov model will
need transition probabilities
Pij (m) on
all
i,
j
pairs and all m belonging to M.

D.4. Problems Associated with
the Use
of
the Markov Process
for
a Bridge
Deterioration Model
The general problems associated with this approach as used currently in USA and Europe
are discussed below:
•
A number of classes of components (e.g. neoprene bearing or post-tensioned T-girders,
full penetration butt-welds in the tensile zones) are to be predetermined (UK has only
20+, whilst USA has
1 00 +), and as a consequence the common grouping for a particular
bridge component for a stock of bridges implies that the condition states and probabilities
are updated for all the bridges in the group at one time, based on the data from a single
sample inspection.
•
There are also uncertainties arising from the 'imprecise' nature of the condition points
in describing the deteriorated condition of a component and the subjective judgement
of the inspector which are not taken into consideration. Care is called for in employing
the Bayesian updating technique based on the inspection records for a type of component
in the bridge stock. The distributions used in the updating of the transition probabilities
need careful development and thought^^.
^
i
•
The Markov approach having the problems as described above is at best a crude model
and
it would be more appropriate in the long-term to refine
it by defining the condition
states and transition probabilities associated, in an explicit manner-bridge-wise, for each
element of the bridge.
•
As such, the definition of the
'condition states
' need to be changed from the present
subjective scale of
1
to 5 to one associated with a scale of reading from NDT tests
appropriate to the predominating deterioration mechanism present in the component.
Although, no allowance is made for the possible correlation between different deterioration
mechanisms, this correlation is difficult to incorporate rationally even in the condition
ratings.
Furthermore,
it
is
likely that for a given component, a particular type of
deterioration will tend to predominate.
•
For very important causeways/bridges, the last two issues are important as any element
in the bridge is likely to be built to a better quality with better craftsmanship and quality
control than in a minor bridge in which the same element type can
also exist.
It
is
obvious that to update the state and probabilities from an inspection on a minor bridge
would be very inappropriate for a strategically important bridge even though both bridges
may belong to the same stock of bridges.
D.5.
Recommendations
for Implementing
a Deterioration Model
for Indian
Bridges
Adopt a Markov approach to predict the rate of future deterioration in bridges.
This model
will be able to predict the condition of a component at some future time and identify the need for
maintenance repairs.
The model will form the basis of the durability module in the multi-criteria
decision support system of a BMS (refer Section 10.5).
This is in keeping with a whole life approach
in which WLC will form the basis of the financial module
in such a BMS support system.

======================================================================
IRC :SP:6 1-2004
Set-up a Working Commission charged witii the formulation of a guideline. Their scope of work
to be:
•
To identify the class of individual bridge components. The more the components, the
greater will be the accuracy in the approach. Components can be further classified into
sub-components identified as belonging to a particular type of construction, particular
material type, etc. Reference may be made to the existing classification used in current
practices
in USA and Europe.
•
Derivation of transition probabilities associated with each component type as evinced
in the national
stock of bridges. The
transition
probabilities
associated with each
component type are updated annually for all such components in a given stock of bridges
on the basis of inspections. Whereas, the conditional probabilities that form the elements
'
of the transition matrix are fixed in time at t=0, they may in future be allowed to vary
in time. Furthermore, the use of Bayesian inference techniques to update the transition
probabilities associated with each component type based on sample inspections, need
well judged
development, as pointed out in Section A. 4.
•
To formulate a scale to rate the condition states of a given component and to provide
a rational basis to deal with the future refinements as pointed out under Section B.4.
It is thought better to relate the scale of condition states directly to ranges of readings
given by Non-Destructive Tests and/or partially destructive test results. Such inspections
involving testing can be done in accordance with the time scale as set down in^ and
the transition probabilities updated at that time.
However, the relative importance of
the same component type could vary between a major and a minor bridge and there
is bound to be variation
in the
state of deterioration due to differing standards of
workmanship and quality evidenced from bridge-to-bridge. In the long-term, the transition
probabilities and the condition state scale should be updated for each component of each
bridge
in the national bridge stock.
With increasing computer and communication
sophistication these actions can be effectively logged and easily accessed for reference.
