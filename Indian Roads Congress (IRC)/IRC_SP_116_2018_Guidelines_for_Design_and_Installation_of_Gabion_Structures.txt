1 Introduction
A Gabion structure is prepared from pre-assembled rectangular cages made of double 
twisted steel woven wire mesh filled with rocks/ boulders. It is a simple gravity retaining 
structure, which retains soil with its weight. These types of structures are in use in highways, 
bridges, canal linings, buildings, shore protection works, etc., as shown in Fig. 1a to d. The 
porosity of gabions prevents the pore-water pressure development behind the walls which, 
is one of the major advantages of these kinds of systems. These structures blend with the 
surroundings and allow vegetation to take roots through the structure which enhances the life 
of the structure. Reduced carbon foot prints are also a noticeable feature when compared to 
conventional solutions.

2 Scope
These guidelines cover the specifications, design principles and installation methodology for 
Gabion and Revet Matresses for use in highway and bridge structures.
3 Elements of Gabion
Following sections describe the characteristics of the materials used in construction of gabion 
walls. In addition to the gabion elements, the performance of the gabion structure hinges on 
the properties of infill, retained fill and the rockfill and other components and measures for 
efficient design and adoptability.
3.1	
Mechanically Woven, Double-Twisted Hexagonal Wire Mesh Gabions
Gabion is rectangular box made from mechanically woven double twisted hexagonal mesh 
filled with rock or stones (Fig. 2c). A terminal wire is used to edge the wire mesh perpendicular 
to the double twist by mechanically wrapping the mesh wires around it at least 2.5 times 
(Fig. 2a).The hexagonal shape of the mesh helps in achieving uniform distribution of forces. 
Mesh should be non-corrosive and should possess high tensile strength. The details of the 
different mesh types, sizes and various tests are available in IS 16014 and are reproduced 
in and Table 3. The wires of the mesh should be galvanised with zinc and/or polymeric 
(coating like Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polyamide (PA6), other polymer etc.) coated to prevent 
corrosion. Better coatings of Zn Al alloy like Zn 95% Al 5% and Zn90% Al 10% are used which 
are better than only Zinc. Similarly better polymeric coatings like polyamide are used.

Fig. 2a Details of Mesh Wire,  
Selvedge and Edge Wire
Fig. 2b: Mesh Type and  
Nominal Size (D)
Fig. 2c: Details of Assembled Gabion Box
Gabion boxes are generally transported in collapsed condition and are restructured into 
boxes of required dimensions at the site. These boxes are joined using stainless steel 
fasteners or lacing wires or galvanised rings depending on the specifications. All these 
materials should be tested and confirmed to the specifications as per IS 4826, IS 12753, 
IS 4454 (IV). The tensile strength of mesh wire lacing wires, stiffeners and fasteners should 
be in accordance with the specifications and requirements as directed by IS 280, with 
minimum elongation of 10 percent with the test performed on a gauge length of test 
specimen of 200 mm. Minimum tensile strength of the wire mesh and zinc and polymeric 
coating shall be as per Table 5. Table 14 gives the requirements of wire coating according 
to the environmental conditions.
3.2	
Polymeric Gabions
Polymeric gabions (Fig. 3) and revet mattresses can be made using polymeric materials 
such as polymeric rope or geogrids. These materials can be easily used in saline waters 
also. However, such type of gabions may not be able to retain the intended shape as 
effectively as compared to steel wire gabions. Polymeric materials starts degrading once 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 62
======================================================================


IRC:SP:116-2018
exposed to sunlight. Also, polymeric materials are highly flammable and catch fire easily. 
Hence, such gabions are mainly used in underwater application or application where these 
materials are not exposed to direct sunlight. Proper machinery shall be considered for lifting 
of ropes while installing polymeric gabions underwater, so that the ropes are not damaged 
in this process.
Fig. 3: Polymer Rope Gabions
3.3	
Revet Mattress
Revet mattress (Fig. 4) is a wire mesh container uniformly partitioned into internal cells with 
relatively smaller height in relation to other dimensions, having smaller mesh openings than 
the mesh used for gabions. It is specialized form of Gabion and has relatively larger plan size 
and shallower depth (Table 4). Their primary function is to protect the bed of watercourse from 
excessive scour. It is intended to prevent the water ripping up its own bed, most commonly 
at weirs, waterfalls and other places where there is a sudden change in water level. Revet 
mattresses are generally used for riverbank protection and channel linings. Minimum tensile 
strength of the wire mesh and zinc and Polymeric coating shall be as per Table 5.

IRC:SP:116-2018
3.4	
Prefilled Gabions / Revet Mattress
Gabions are filled on site manually or with machinery. In case of underwater application, 
gabion filling is not possible. Also, in case of emergency filling of gabion is not feasible. In 
such conditions gabions are prefilled and installed. Generally, gabions for prefilled application 
are filled in the plant or suitable nearby location.
4 Components of Gabion Retaining Wall
Gabion walls are mass gravity walls having three major components like gabion box, stone 
for filling gabion, filter media and backfill (Fig. 5). This section presents specifications of 
various materials used in gabion structures.

Tests and Standard of Acceptance
Gabion and revert mattress mesh and materials shall be tested in accordance with procedure 
outline below and IS 16014 and shall meet prescribed criteria mentioned in Table 5.
Tensile Strength of Wire Mesh Panel
The wire mesh specimens shall be representative of proper field construction as to materials, 
mesh geometry, and workmanship, and shall be as large as practical to minimize the effect 
of variations. The tests shall be run with the load applied parallel to the axis of the twist and 
repeated on a separate test specimen with the load applied perpendicular to the axis of the 
twist.
Place the mesh into the machine grips such that the gripped mesh will be maintained in the 
mesh geometry characteristic of field use. The specimen of approximately 0.8 m width and 
0.5 m height shall be tested. The effective width to be considered for test specimen shall be 
the distance between two extreme gripping points. The specimen should extend by at least 
one mesh repetition beyond the extreme gripping points on either side. However, specimen 
should not extend more than two mesh repetitions beyond extreme gripping points. The 
mesh shall be pre-loaded to 10% of the specified minimum strength and machine head travel 
stopped. The mesh gauge dimensions shall be recorded at this time and taken as the initial 
dimensions of the specimen where such dimensions are required. If the sample slips at any 
of the gripping point during the test, such a test shall be discarded and a new sample shall 
be taken. The loading shall then continue uniformly maintaining the displacement rate of 
75 to 100 mm per minute, until first fracture or unwrapping of an individual wire in the system 
occurs. The distortion of the mesh or changes in gauge length shall be measured to accuracy 
consistent with reporting the percentage elongation to the nearest 0.5%.

Punch Test
The punch test could be done using two different apparatus.
1)	
Pre-Tensioned Punch Test
An uncut section of 1.82 m in length (unselvedged) and not less than 0.91 m in width shall 
have the ends securely clamped for 0.91 m along the width of the sample. When the width 
of the section under test exceeds 0.91 m, the clamps shall be cantered along the width and 
the excess width will be allowed to fall free on each side of the clamped section. The sample 
shall then be subjected to tension sufficient to cause 10% elongation of the sample section 
between the clamps. After elongation and while clamped as described above (and otherwise 
unsupported), the section shall be subjected to a load over 960 cm2 of area applied to the 
approximate center of the sample section between the clamps and in a direction perpendicular 
to the direction of the tension force.
2)	
Secured Punch Test
An uncut section of 1.24 m in length and not less than 0.9 m in width (selvedged), including 
all selvedge bindings, shall have the sides and the ends securely clamped at every mesh 
opening to a rigid frame. After being secured as described above, the section shall be 
subjected to a load over 960 cm2 applied to the approximate center of the sample section 
between the clamps and in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the tension force.
The sample shall withstand, without rupture of any strand or opening of any mesh fastening, 
an actual load applied by means of a circular ram at a uniform rate not to exceed 220 N/s 
equalling or exceeding the values shown in Table 5. The ram head used in the test shall be 
circular with a 350 mm diameter and have its edges bevelled or rounded to prevent cutting 
of the wire strands.
Pull-Apart Resistance Test
A set of two identical rectangular gabion panels, each with a width about 10½ mesh openings 
along a selvedge wire, shall be joined by properly installed wire fasteners along the two 
selvedge wires so that each fastener confines two selvedge and two mesh wires. If the 
fasteners are also to be used to join two individual empty gabion baskets, two additional 
selvedge wires that are each mechanically wrapped with mesh wires shall be included so 
that each fastener confines four selvedge and four mesh wires. The set of the jointed panels 
shall be subject to pull-apart resistance test. The specimen shall be mounted on a loading 
machine with grips or clamps such that the panels are uniformly secured along the full width. 
The grips or clamps shall be designed to only transmit tension forces. The load will then be 
applied at a uniform rate not to exceed 220 N/s until failure occurs. The failure is defined 
as when the maximum load is reached and a drop of strength is observed with subsequent 
loading or alternately the opening between any two closest selvedge wires, applicable to a 
fastener confining either two or four selvedge wires, becomes greater than 50 mm at any 
place along the panel width. The strength requirements of the jointed panels at failure shall 
be as shown in Table 5.

Fabrication
Gabions shall be manufactured with all components mechanically connected at the production 
facility. The front, base, back and lid of the gabions shall be woven into a single unit. The 
ends and diaphragm(s) shall be factory connected to the base. The lid may be a separate 
piece made of the same type mesh as the basket. All perimeter edges of the mesh forming 
the basket and top, or lid, shall be mechanically selvedge with wire having a larger diameter.
Gabion is divided into cells by means of diaphragms positioned at approximately 1m centres. 
The diaphragms shall be secured in position to the base so that no additional lacing is 
necessary at the jobsite.
4.2	
Rocks for Filling the Gabion
An unweathered (sound) naturally occurring angular or crushed hard rock material can be 
used for filling. Stone for the Gabion facia shall be hard, angular to round, durable and of 
such quality that they shall not disintegrate on exposure to water or weathering during the 
life of the structure. The minimum size of the rock to be filled in the boxes is governed by 
the mesh opening “D” in the mesh as shown in Fig. 2b. The minimum and maximum size 
of the stone used for filling shall be 1.5 to 2.5 times the mesh opening. Each range of sizes 
may allow for a variation of 5% oversize rock by number of particles, or 5% undersize rock 
by number of particles, or both. The rock pieces should be properly hand-placed and packed 
with their larger dimensions in the horizontal position.The size of any oversize rock shall 
allow for the placement of minimum of three layers of rock must be achieved when filling the 
1 m high units and a minimum of two layers for the 0.50 m high gabion units and 0.3m thick 
gabion mattress.

locally called as ‘murram’, classified as GC, GM or GC-GM may be used provided the fines 
content (defined as combined percentage of silt and clay) does not exceed 20 %.
5 Soil reinforcement units for retaining structure
Mechanically woven double twisted steel wire mesh units used for soil reinforced and slope 
consolidation. For structures with vertical facing units are made with a hexagonal wire mesh 
continuous base panel for the reinforcement and facing portion of the structure. Mechanically 
woven double twisted steel wire mesh unit and continuous base panel is divided into two cells 
by means of a diaphragm positioned at approximately 1 m centres (Fig. 6). The diaphragm 
shall be secured in position to the base so that no additional lacing is necessary at the job-
site. The facing section of the unit is formed by connecting the back panel and a diaphragm 
to the main unit.
Mechanically woven double twisted steel wire mesh units are combined with high strength 
geogrid when only mesh tensile strength is not sufficient to resist forces. Vertical facing 
units are combined with high strength geogrid which act as primary soil reinforcement and 
continuous base panel act as secondary reinforcement with friction (Fig. 7 and 8). Vertical 
facing RS unit is held by friction between the facia and primary reinforcement. Structure shall 
be designed based on results of pullout test as per ASTM D 6638. In case, facia is connected 
to reinforcement using mechanical connection, a reduction factor for joint strength must be 
included. The test procedure to be followed is a sustained ASTM D5262 test. Note that this 
test is to be conducted for 1,000 hours at a minimum as mentioned in GRI Standard Practice 
GG4(b). The connection between the facia and the reinforcement shall provide for 100 % of 
the long term design strength of the reinforcing element in continuity.
Reinforced Soil (RS) wall / slope facia can be built with a stepped or vertical face, with 
or without a batter. These RS structures are designed for sites and situations where it is

storms,…) shall be metallic coated with polymer coating or shall be made from stainless 
steel wire.
(b)	
Metallic coating shall be heavily coated wire as per IS 4826 or class A as per ISO 7989-
2. There exist more advanced metallic coatings with a superior corrosion resistance. 
In terms of salt spray performance (ISO 9227), it means that the mesh samples shall 
not show more than 5% of DBR (Dark Brown Rust) after 2000 hr exposure on the 
surface. When subjected to test in sulphur dioxide environment (ISO 6988), mesh 
samples shall not show more than 5% of DBR after 56 cycles of discontinuous test on 
the surface. Assumed working life values will, therefore, be improved depending upon 
the prevailing conditions.
(c)	
More advanced organic coatings with an equivalent or superior corrosion protection 
may be considered in order to improve the assumed working life.
6 Design principle of Gabion retaining wall
Gabion structure is a simple flexible gravity retaining structure, which retains soil with its 
weight. Gabion walls are designed on the same principle as gravity mass wall. The gabion 
structure should be designed in such manner that gabion mesh can hold the rock within 
with limited deformation which does not affect asthetics and internal stability. Limit state 
principles are used for design of gabion walls. Based on the requirement at the site, the 
gabion walls can be designed with several configurations such as (a) with stepped outside 
or (b) as stepped inside or (c) offset as shown in Fig. 9a to 9c. The latter is preferable from 
economy, but site constraints predominate.

Drainage Bay for Gabion
Unlike concrete structures, retaining walls or reinforced walls, there is no need to provide any 
drainage system for Gabion walls, as the gabion itself is porous and can drain freely. In order 
to prevent ingress of soil into the pores of the gabion wall, a filter, preferably a nonwoven 
geotextile should be provided between the gabion and the backfill as shown in Fig. 10. It is 
advisable to take measures to improve the drainage in the back of the wall using boulder/
gravels/coarse grain material at the lower level of the fill and possibly providing a catch water 
drain for conveyance of collected water to convenient location (Fig. 11).
Fig. 10: Use of Non-Woven Geotextile  
in Gabion Retaining Wall as Filter Media  
for Drainage
Fig. 11: Drainage System for Gabion Retaining 
Wall for Heavy Rainfall Condition
In fine silty or sandy soils, it is important to select a filling material which can serve as a 
filter to prevent migration of the soil through the structure. It is advisable to use non woven 
geotextile against the rear face of the wall which act as filter and prevent washing out of 
backfill. The geotextile material should be preferably non-woven type III meeting requirements 
mentioned in section 4.3. The use of nonwoven geotextile type 1 shall also be used in river 
and marine works where a continuous and frequent water movement will flush the wall and 
the soil behind it. Nonwoven geotextile is sometimes useful for providing a filter between 
the excavated surface and the backfill and for preventing the washout of fines from the 
foundation (Fig. 12).
Natural gullies shall be diverted away from the wall site so that flow of rain water does not 
cause erosion of walls on topmost terrace. Grass turfing shall be laid on the ground slope to 
prevent erosion.

6.2	
Base Width
The base width of the Gabion wall for height 1 m to 6 m should recommended as 0.6 to 0.75 H 
and for above 6 m to 10 m it should be 0.55-0.65 H and shall satisfy the design requirement.
6.3	
Embedment Depth
The minimum embedment depth of Gabion retaining wall should be minimum 0.5 m for flat 
ground condition for height 1m to 6 m and 1m embedment depth for height 6 m to 10 m shall 
be provided as per IS 14458 Part 1.
Larger values may be required, depending on the depth of frost penetration, shrinkage and 
swelling of foundation soil, seismic activity and scour. Minimum embedment depth of 0.5 m 
is required for any structure except for structures founded on rock. Embedment depth of wall 
resting of rock can be reduced as excavation in rock will be difficult. In such case embedment 
depth can be 0.3m – 0.5m with foundation may be levelled using concrete and some dowels 
may be provided.
6.4	
Batter Angle
Batter of Gabion wall with respect to vertical can be considered as 3 to 6 degrees with 
vertical. Also, gabion wall can be constructed with vertical gabions and offset maintained on 
outer side (Fig. 9b).
6.5	
Loading
Retaining wall shall be designed for live load surcharge equivalent to 1.2 m earth wall as per 
IRC:6. Application of earth pressure force as per Coulomb’s theory should be applied at H/3 
from base of the wall. Gabion wall is more flexible compared to rigid R.C.C retaining wall, 
the inertial effects due to horizontal acceleration is considered wedge of earth and vertical

acceleration is neglected. Also only 50 percent of dynamic increment on the earth pressure 
of retained fill is considered. Peak horizontal acceleration is selected based on the seismic 
zone (design earthquake) given as A, Acceleration co-efficient [refer IS:1893]
6.6	
Porosity of Gabion
A maximum porosity of 40 percent can be considered for the design of gabion purpose. In 
general, 35% to 40% porosity can be achieved. Porosity of gabion can be minimized by using 
rock sizes mentioned in 4.2 and using small size rock / stone chips filling voids between 
stones.
6.7	
Extent of Backfill
Selected backfill shall be extended till 45+Φ/2 line from toe of Gabion which meets the top 
surface [as per IRC:78] as presented below in Fig. 13.
Fig 13: Extent of Backfill
6.8	
Stability of a Retaining Structure
Based on height of the wall (H), trial design has to be performed, with minimum width of 
0.5 m on the top and the width increasing with depth, in steps, as it reaches to the foundation 
level. It is recommended that the increment in the width should not be more than 1.0 m per 
step. This trial design must be checked against different types of failure. Final cross section 
of the wall shall satisfy all failure modes mentioned In the case of gravity retaining walls the 
main types of failure which may occur, are shown in Fig.14

Determination of Active Thrust
Coulomb’s theory is a method used to calculate the active and passive thrust acting on a 
retaining structure. It assumes that the soil total shear resistance is mobilized along the 
sliding and failure surfaces located within the soil mass. Coulomb’s method assumes that 
such surfaces are plane and that the thrust acts on the most critical failure surface. Besides 
making it possible to analyse structures with a non-vertical internal front face, this method 
allows consideration of a possible friction between retaining structure and soil. In case of 
layered backfill,to determine the application point of the total active thrust, the soil parameters 
acting on the wall are assumed to vary linearly in each layer crossed by the active thrust.

Where γ is the unit weight of the soil layer and Ka is the lateral earth pressure coefficient. This 
coefficient is determined by Coulomb’s equation:
Ka = 
Active thrust = Effect due to Earth pressure + Surcharge + Seismic
6.10	
Safety against Sliding
The horizontal forces acting on the wall, due to soil and possible dead and live loads should 
be less than the frictional force at the base of the wall. The friction coefficient between the 
base of the gabion wall and the foundation soil can be tan φ’ as gabion has rough surface 
in contact with foundation. Friction coefficient generally lies in the range of 0.5 to 1. Field 
tests showed friction coefficient value equal to tan (φ’) [23]. Friction coefficient can be reduced 
by 15% when nonwoven geotextile is used at base of gabion wall. Sliding factor of safety, 
the ratio of the forces resisting sliding (due to the mass of the gabions Wg and the vertical 
component of active thrust Pv and the sliding forces due to the horizontal component of active 
thrust moment Ph ,on the plane of sliding, for the gabion wall should not be less than 1.5 in 
static condition.

Both thrust Pa and Pp, the structure specific weight Wg and the foundation pressure R are 
the forces acting on the structure (Fig. 17). The foundation reaction R may be divided into 
forces N and T respectively normal and tangential to the base of the retaining structure.
Beside these forces, one must consider other forces depending on external conditions. For 
example, if the structure is submerged either partially or totally, the uplift pressures V must 
be taken into account, whereas in the seismic analysis one must consider the horizontal and 
vertical forces. The surcharge loads are additional forces which may act directly upon the 
structure.

moment can overturn the wall, if properly not designed. The counter moments or the restoring 
moments are again due to the self-weight of the gabion wall, the vertical component of earth 
pressure force, the weight of the soil on the ledges, loads acting on the wall etc. Factor of 
safety against overturning, the ratio of the overturning moment and the restoring moments, 
for a safe condition, should be greater than 2.

Vertical component of the active thrust.
The inertia forces induced by the seismic effect and the uplift pressures which are involved 
when the wall is partially under water are considered in the calculation and contribute to 
decrease the restoring moment. The overturning moment is formed by the moment of the 
active thrust acting on the wall.

Safety against Bearing
The pressure due to the dead load of the gabion walls should be within the permissible limits 
of the allowable bearing capacity of the foundation soil. Though due to the flexibility of the 
gabion walls, the settlements are not a major issue, care should be taken to estimate the 
settlements and the compensation for the same. In general, the foundation soil is subjected 
to a vertical force, a horizontal force and moment. Therefore, the resultant load amounts to 
an eccentric-inclined load. The base and other dimensions of the wall should be such that the 
resultant of the forces falls within the middle one-third of the base.
To calculate the pressures acting on the foundation of the structure, first determine both 
the point of application of the normal force N which is calculated during the check against 
sliding and the moment equilibrium with respect to the lower left angle of the base, which is 
given by:
d = (

This normal force is the resultant of the normal pressures which act on the base of the 
retaining structure (Fig. 20). Usually base pressures have a linear distribution with maximum 
and minimum values will be at the edges of the base of the wall.

N = Normal force at the base of the wall
	
B – Base width of gabion
	
e – Eccentricity at Normal base N with e ≤ B/6

A retaining wall should not be attempted if weight of backfill will exceed the allowable bearing 
pressure of the underlying soil. In such cases, light weight backfill (e.g. flyash) can be used to 
lower base pressure or the soft underlying soil should be replaced with compacted granular 
soil.
When the foundation soil is non-cohesive type, the minimum depth of the foundation can 
be limited to 0.5 m for low height walls. For high walls, the depth of embedment shall be 
increased. In case of cohesive ground, the embedment depth shall be more than 500 mm. 
It is recommended to lay a granular base to a thickness of 300-500 mm in case where 
the gabions are to be laid on cohesive soil, over which the gabion wall can be designed 
with the foundation properties same as the granular fill. However, it is strongly advised to 
estimate the settlement using the properties of the cohesive ground and compensate the 
height accordingly.

6.13	
Safety against Internal Failure
The retaining structure must be checked 
against the possibility of internal failure since 
it is subjected to internal stresses due to the 
thrust and to the surcharge loads directly 
applied on the wall. The mechanism of internal 
failure can be divided according to the type of 
structure. In case of Gabion walls, check each 
layer shall be checked against sliding with 
respect to the layer above and below it (Fig. 
21). For this analysis, one must determine the 
active thrust which acts on the wall portion 
above the analysed section.
The shear and the maximum normal stresses acting on this section, are calculated by using 
the force and moment equilibrium,
The shear stress will be calculated as -
τ = T
B
Maximum normal stress will be
σ max
d

Where B is the width of the gabion layer of the section analyzed and T, N and d, are obtained 
from the force and moment equilibrium. The allowable values of both shear and normal stress 
shall be calculated considering properties of mesh used for making gabion box. Gabion 
mesh provides confinement to stones which contribute in apparent cohesion and increased 
friction angle. These parameters shall be used by designed based on laboratory tests or 
experiments [22]. As explained earlier that the Gabion structure is flexible and permeable. While 
the settlements cannot be avoided, the gabions can adjust to the settled/deformed profile. 
Gabions can tolerate high differential settlements without losing integrity. Overall gabions 
wall settlement shall be assessed based on foundation soil properties. Also, deformation of 
gabion layers shall be assessed which is dependent on normal stress, properties of mesh 
like tensile strength, punch resistance, filling of gabion etc.
6.14	
Safety against Overall / Global Failure
Besides the types of failure indicated above, gabion walls may be subjected to global failure 
along a failure surface external to the gabion walls. This type of failure may occur when the 
foundation consists soil layers with different characteristics, some less resistant than others

horizontal.
The stability analysis most commonly used assume the behaviour of the soil mass as a rigid 
body subjected to failure on curved surface.
Fig. 22: Soil surface divided into slices (Bishops method)
Limit equilibrium method such as Bishop’s simplified method of slices which refers 
to circular surfaces can be used (Fig. 22). In order to find critical surface with lowest 
factor safety computer program can be used as hand calculations will take longer 
time.
7 Design principle of Gabion / revet mattresses
Before the design of the River structures with Gabions and mattresses, the important 
parameters for the design have to be worked out. These include -
	
a)	
Peak Velocity of flow
	
b)	
River bed gradient
	
c)	
Peak flood discharge,
	
d)	
Type of soil on the river bank and bed
	
e)	
River width
	
f)	
Different water levels (i.e .low, normal and high water levels)
	
g)	
River /Channel geometry.
Gabion or revet mattresses shall be used as revetments to prevent surface erosion only on 
geotechnical stable slopes. In case of slope instability, suitable stabilization measures shall 
be carried out.
7.1	
Design Data
Discharge: The discharge for which river training works are to be designed shall be in 
accordance with the recommendations of IRC:5.

IRC:SP:116-2018
Scour depth: The mean depth of scour below the highest flood level shall be calculated in 
accordance with the provisions of IRC: 5
7.2	
Thickness of the Mattress
Research and Development work carried out at Colorado State University Fort Collinsto 
test the performance of gabion mattress under various hydraulic conditions. This test was 
carried out both at full-scale and on scale-model to establish the behaviour and stability of 
channel revetment protected with Gabions and mattress. Based on the research results, the 
thickness of the mattress is selected considering the flow velocity that the mattress has to 
sustain slope angle φ the river bank and the average stone fill size that would be available for 
filling the mattress box. Indicative thickness of gabion mattress in relation to water velocity 
shall be given as per Annexure II. Selected thickness of mattress shall be checked for the 
tractive shear stress criteria i.e. the revetment stability check along the bed and slope portion.
7.3	
Tractive Force Theory
Checks against erosive effects are satisfied when the actual (effective) shear stress generated 
by the flow at each section point in contact with flowing water is lower than the maximum 
allowable shear stress on the channel surface. The tractive force theory assumes that as 
the actual shear stress exceeds the maximum surface tolerable shear stress, a dynamic 
transport of colloidal and later larger aggregates occurs.
For revet mattresses placed on channel beds or banks, the shear stress on the mattress 
I calculated as follows [15]:
	
τb = K1 Kb γw y Sf
Where,
	
τb – Design shear stress
	
γw – Unit weight of water
	
y – Maximum depth of water on revetment in m
	
Sf  – Slope of energy grade line (average river bed slope)
	
K1 – slope factor: 1 for horizontal, 0.75 for sloped surfaces
	
Kb – Bend coefficient (dimensionless explained below)
The bend coefficient Kb is used to calculate the increased shear stress on the outside of a 
bend. This coefficient ranges from 1.05 to 2.0, depending on the severity of the bend. The 
bend coefficient is a function of the radius of curvature Rc divided by the top width of the 
channel T, as follows:
	
Kb = 2.0	
for 2 ≥ Rc/T
	
Kb = 2.38-0.206 (Rc/T) + 0.0073(Rc/T) 2	
for 10 > Rc/T > 2
	
Kb = 1.05	
for Rc/T ≥ 10

The recommended procedure for determining the permissible shear stress for a gabion

γs – Unit weight of the rock fills (22-26 kN/m3)

d50 – Median diameter of rockfill in mattress
The coefficient Cs is an empirical coefficient developed by Maynord (1995) from test data 
presented in Simons et al. (1984). Use of Cs = 0.10 got gabion / revet mattress, in which ratio 
of maximum to minimum stone size ranges from 1.5 to 2.0. Higher Cs may be used when 
testing carried out such materials. Shear stress on bed shall be less than permissible shear 
stress.
τb < τc
Toe Protection: Toe protection may be provided such that the mattress on the slope shall not 
slide due to undermining and scouring at the toe. For toe protection, mattresses in the form 
of launching apron or toe wall shall be provided based on the severity of the scour. Thickness 
of launching apron may be considered as 20-50% more than the bank protection thickness 
provided on slope.
The thickness of the gabion mattress should be at least twice the average diameter of the rock 
fill, T ≥ 2d50. If the computed thickness does not match that of a standard gabion thickness, 
the next larger thickness of mattress should be used.
7.4	
Design of Launching Apron
Launching apron should be laid at Low Water Level (LWL). The launching apron should be 
designed to launch along the slope of scour and provide a protection layer so that scouring 
is checked. The size of launching apron should be such that it should form a protection layer 
up to level of maximum scour depth. Slope of launching apron may be taken as 2H: 1V 
(Fig. 24). Non-woven geotextile filter below the launching apron may also be provided.

IRC:SP:116-2018
Width of the launching apron depends upon the scour depth below HFL.
Depth of scour below HFL (D) may be worked out from the following formula.
D = 0.473 (Q/f) 1/3
Where Q= design discharge in cumecs
f is silt factor. Silt factor (f) may be calculated using the following formula
f= 1.76 (d) 1/2
Where,
d is mean particle diameter of river material in mm
Maximum scour depth (Dmax) below HFL= 1.5* Scour depth (Dbelow HFL).
Maximum Scour depth (Dmax) below LWL = (Dmax) below HFL – (HFL-LWL)
Width of Launching Apron = 1.5 * Maximum Scour depth (Dmax) below LWL

Structure with Deep Foundation
The wall must be founded at a level which is not affected by water scour problems. It is 
recommended where the river bed material is virtually in erodible or where it consists of solid 
rock (Fig. 26). This type of foundation is appropriate where the rock and gravel deposits can 
provide adequate foundations.

Structure Built on Replaced Soil
When the foundation strata are weak/cohesive or soft soil, replaced soil or free drained soil 
used for backfill soil can be used for certain depth, ensure to satisfy the bearing capacity 
checks of the soil in the design. However, the bed soil replacement shall be feasible in case 
of continuously flowing river. In such conditions, the replacement or scour hole filling shall be 
made with cylindrical gabions or loose stones as shown in Fig. 27 and Fig. 29.

8 Installation methodology of Gabion
Gabions are delivered at the work site in bundles along with the lacing wire. Bundles must 
be unloaded using any available machine and stored close to the site where they are to 
be installed. While unloading care shall be taken that Gabion bundles are not damaged. 
Maximum 4 bundles shall be stacked over each other. Gabion bundles shall be stacked on 
a leveled ground with wooden rafters/sleepers in between them for easy in handling and 
preventing any damage to the mesh and other components like the selvedge wire.Storage 
can be outdoors as long as the bundles are not laid over abrasive or chemically aggressive 
surfaces (corrugated asphalt, oils, grease, chemicals, etc.).
The following are the steps in the basic procedure for erection and installation of structures. 
At the work site bundles should be opened and gabions assembled according to the following 
instructions:
	
1)	
Excavate the formation to the required level as shown in the drawings. If good 
bearing stratum is not observed after the excavation up to mentioned levels 
then, the same should be brought to the notice of Engineer-in-charge for 
further advice. The surface of formation should be free from any deleterious 
material and unwanted foreign objects. Loose pockets if any, should be 
excavated and filled with suitable granular or backfill material.
	
2)	
The place should be cleared of standing water to ensure proper placement 
of gabions. In case dewatering is not possible then gabions shall be installed 
underwater.
	
3)	
Compact the formation using Vibro-roller of 8 to 10 tonnes capacity. Density of 
compacted formation should be greater than or equal to 95% of the modified 
Proctor value.
	
4)	
The outer alignment of the gabion facia should be marked by the survey 
team as per the requirements in the drawings.
	
5)	
The gabions are unfolded and laid over an even, level and hard surface 
(compact ground). One or two persons may be deployed for the straightening 
of mesh panel activity depending on the size of gabions. The gabions should 
be properly assembled and wired together, so that all four corners match and 
form an exact rectangular shape and size as designed (Fig. 30a and b).

6)	
The side panels are opened up to form a box by tying the upper corner of 
each pair of side panels using the thick selvedge wires (Fig. 31a).
	
7)	
The edges are laced together, starting from top corner, in a continuous 
operation using alternate single and double loop at the spacing of one mesh 
length i.e., 100 mm to 125 mm. The ends of the lacing wire are secured at 
each corner and turned into the gabions. Individual ties of lacing wire should 
not be used. Alternatively, steel rings mentioned IS16014 can be used which 
are attached using mechanical tool (Fig. 31a and 31b).
	
8)	
Similarly all the other sides are tied up and the box structure made, with the 
top end open to fill the boxes.

9)	
The filling is then carried out with stones of dimensions larger than that of 
the mesh opening making sure that there are minimum voids. For better 
finish the stone fill to the front face is selected and placed carefully to give 
the best appearance. When using quarried/crushed rock, rock shall be 
selected in such a way that at least one face is flat-shaped. This will not 
be applicable when using rounded stone from rivers. Front loader or back 
loaders or excavator can be used to fill gabions maintaining porosity. For 



======================================================================

======================================================================
43

IRC:SP:116-2018
a better alignment of the face, it is advisable to include internal tie wires 
while filling the gabions. This horizontal tie wires prevent gabion deformation 
during the filling stage.
	
	
Porosity check
	
	
The average porosity of the Gabion boxes can be found out by weighing the 
filled boxes. The weight of the box can be compared with calculated weight 
of box.
	
	
Let us assume the density of the stone (γs)= 26 kN/cum.
	
	
In general porosity of the filled Gabion box shall be around (n) 30-40%.
	
	
Density of gabion would be γg = γs * (1 – n) ignoring air voids
	
	
Assuming 35% porosity the density of gabion = 16.9 kN /cum.
	
	
Hence, weight of 1.5 x 1 x1 m Gabion box = 1.5 x 16.9 = 25.35 kN ~ 2.5 ton
	
	
The weight of the filled gabion box should be approximately equal to the 
calculated weight.
	
10)	 In case of one meter high boxes, gabions should be filled to one-third height 
and the tie wires fixed (Fig. 32).The same sequence is repeated at two-third 
height. For 0.5 m high, gabion requires only one row of tie wires at half the 
height of the gabion.
Fig. 32: Bracing wire details
	
11)	 The filled layer should never be more than 300 mm higher than any adjoining 
cell. To avoid such circumstances the filling pattern shown in below Fig. 33 
should be followed The Gabion is over-filled by approximately 25 mm to 
50 mm, to allow for settlement of the infill (due to self-weight).

Fig. 33: Filling Pattern of Gabion Boxes
	
12)	 MS pipe/frame formwork shall be provided at the gabion facia for achieving 
a good aesthetic appearance and keeping the bulges within the specified 
tolerances. The formwork enables to achieve uniformity in the gabion box 
dimensions during the filling and placement of stones. As far as possible a 
fair face of large flat stone should be placed at the exposed faces only.
a) Temporary Formwork
b) Use of pipes
Fig. 34: Use of steel frame or pipes to avoid gabion bulging during filling operation
	
13)	 The lids are folded back and laced first to the front panels, then to the side 
ones and to any existing diaphragm to close the Gabions. The gabions in 
upper layer shall be connected to the top of gabions in the lower layer along 
the front and back edges of the contact surface using the same connecting 
procedure. Facia of adjoining units must be securely joined together, along 
the vertical facing and top edges of their contact surfaces.

14)	 Other boxes are also placed and packed in position following the same 
procedure to complete the wall.
	
15)	 The Gabions should be covered on the inner face with a non-woven geotextile 
before placing and compacting the backfill.
Fig. 36: Typical Photo of Non-woven Geo textile below

16)	 The soil for structural fill shall be placed and compacted to 95% of modified 
Proctor density in the area behind the gabion units.
	
17)	 Compact the structural fill using Vibro-roller of 8 to 10 tonnes capacity. 
Compacted density shall not be less than 95% modified Proctor density for

the formation. The compaction within 1.5 m of the rear of the face element 
shall be carried out using vibratory plate compactors or walk behind rollers 
having 1 tonne capacity.
8.1	
Some Causes of Failure of Gabion Retaining Walls
As explained earlier that the Gabion structure is flexible and permeable. While the settlements 
cannot be avoided, the gabions can adjust to the settled/deformed profile. Development of 
pore pressure at the back of the wall may be negligible.
There have been some causes of failure of the gabion walls due to improper wrong data, 
improper design, poor workmanship at site and/or material failure. Some of such failures 
include:
	
1)	
Insufficient data collection required to improper design and hence the final 
performance is affected.
	
2)	
While these structures can be constructed with local labours including skilled 
and unskilled labour, minimum machinery and equipment, construction 
of Gabion wall is highly quality conscious. It needs to be constructed as 
monolithic structure with simultaneous backfilling and compaction which is 
often not followed at site due to poor workmanship.
	
3)	
Improper galvanisation of the wires (mesh, fastening, lacing, stiffening etc.). 
Improper galvanising leads to the premature degradation of wires/gabions, 
causing the failure of the structure.
	
4)	
Improper foundation and placing of gabion layers without the required 
preparation can lead to excessive settlements and thereby deformation of 
the structure.
	
5)	
Use of improper graded aggregate or rock and improper filling may lead to 
post construction deformations of the boxes and settlements.
8.2	
Under Water Installation Sequence for Gabion / Revet Mattress
For river bank or flood protection works, it is required to install Gabion/revet Mattress under 
water. The installation could be either in the river bed or at locations where presence of water 
cannot be avoided. Method statement for installation of Gabion/revet Mattress underwater 
presented in following paragraph. There could be changes to this procedure as per site 
conditions and machinery availability.
The units shall be filled near the site and then placed in position by means of a crane. 
Great care shall be taken while handling and placing the Mattress or Gabion units to avoid 
any significant damage. Such units shall be laid close to each other and wired together, if 
necessary, with wire having the same characteristics of the mesh. For lining steep slopes 
with revet Mattresses, it is advisable to anchor them at the top of the slope with the help of 
short piles. This will prevent the sliding of the individual units during placement.



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 62
======================================================================
47

IRC:SP:116-2018
The following sequence shall be adopted for successful placement of the units at the required 
locations i.e. under or above water.
	
1)	
Keep ready the Gabion/ Revet Mattresses for installation. After the filling 
and placement of stones is completed 16 or 20 mm diameter steel bars are 
placed along the top perimeter of the unit. These are used for enabling the 
large-sized hooks of the crane to lift the units without damaging the mesh 
wire. The diameter of the bar can be finalized depending on the size of the 
unit.
	
2)	
A Barge mounted crane is required in lifting and placing the Revert Mattress 
or Gabion units at the specified location.
	
3)	
The c/c distance between the individual lifting points of the frame shall not be 
greater than 1m.
	
4)	
The Barge is then maneuvered and positioned in such a way that the crane 
is able to lift and place the revet mattress or Gabion at the specified location.
	
5)	
As the revet Mattress is lowered in the water, around 2 - 3 deep water divers 
take their position around the mattress and guide the crane operator. The 
divers shall guide the crane operator about the positioning and lowering of 
frame so that the mattress is placed at approximate location.
Fig. 37: Underwater Placement of Revet Mattress by Crane
	
6)	
Once the Mattress has been placed at the specified location the divers shall 
signal to the crane operator to halt all movements and lower the boom just a 
little so that the hooks of the frame can be released under water.

Annexure II  
(clause 7.2)
Details of Thickness of Gabion Mattress in Relation to Water Velocity
Research and Development work carried out at Colorado State University Fort Collinsto 
test the performance of gabion mattress under various hydraulic conditions. This test was 
carried out both at full-scale and on scale-model to establish the behaviour and stability of 
channel revetment protected with Gabions and mattress. Based on the research results, the 
thickness of the mattress is selected considering the flow velocity that the mattress has to 
sustain and the average stone fill size that would be available for filling the mattress box. This 
selected thickness of mattress is then checked for the tractive shear stress criteria i.e. the 
revetment stability check along the bed and slope portion.

Where, Critical Velocity- the maximum velocity at which no movement of the filling material 
will occur. Limit Velocity denote the velocity at which modest deformation of the mattress 
has occurred due to movement of the fill material and which does not materially affect the 
discharge capacity.The thickness of the mattress is determined by three factors: the erodibility 
of the bank soil, the maximum velocity of the water, and the bank slope. When precise 
soil investigation is not available, preliminary thickness of mattresses can be chosen from 
Table II-2. These values are based on observations of a large number of mattress installations 
which assume a filling material.
