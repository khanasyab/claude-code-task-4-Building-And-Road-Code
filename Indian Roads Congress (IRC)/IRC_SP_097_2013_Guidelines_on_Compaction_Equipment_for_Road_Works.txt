GUIDELINES ON COMPACTION EQUIPMENT
FOR ROAD WORKS
1 INTRODUCTION
Road construction is an important part of infrastructure development. Even though compaction
may account for less than 4% of the total construction cost, the benefits that accrue in terms of
longevity and riding quality are immense. To achieve long
life span of the road,
it is essential
that
its structural strength
is maintained. Compaction of soil helps
in increasing the load
bearing capacity, wear resistance, impermeability and
life. Similarly, optimal compaction of
bituminous binder and wearing course helps
in improving the interlocking of the aggregate
particles resulting
in reduction
in permeability and improving the durability of the road. The
process of compaction of concrete involves removal of air voids to improve the strength. As
such a comprehensive document "Guidelines on Compaction Equipment for Road Works"
has been prepared.
Recognising
the
need
for
guidelines
on
compaction
equipment
for
road
works,
the
Mechanisation Committee (G-4) undertook the task of preparation of the guidelines for the
same. The
initial draft was presented by the Convenor of G-4 Committee. The Committee
deliberated on the draft in a number of meetings. The Committee finally, approved the draft
in
its meeting held on
9*^ May, 2012 for placing before the GSS Committee. The General
Specifications and Standards Committee (GSS) approved
this document
in
its meeting
held on
24*"^ May, 2012. The Executive Committee
in
its meeting held on
SO'*^ May, 2012 at
Kohima approved the document for placing
it before the Council. The Council
in
its meeting
held at Kohima on
1^' June, 2012 approved the draft "Guidelines on Compaction Equipment
for Road Works" subject to modification
in
light of comments offered
in the meeting and
authorized Convenor GSS Committees to finalize the document for printing. The document
duly incorporating the comments of the Council members was approved by the Convenor, G-4
Committee on 5'^ June, 2013 for placing before the GSS Committee. The GSS Committee in
its meeting held on
6''' August, 2013 approved the "Guidelines on Compaction Equipment for
Road Works" for publishing.

1.1
Aim of the Document
With
the
increased emphasis on
road and
growth
in
road
network,
the
technological
development and mechanisation
is taking place rapidly. Compaction
is an important activity
in road construction. Therefore various types of compaction equipment for soil, bituminous
and concrete works have been incorporated
in the document. The document will be helpful
in
selecting
the
appropriate
type,
better
operation, and
creating awareness about
the
maintenance aspects of the compaction equipment.
The
life of the road depends on
its structural strength. Optimum compaction
is essential to
achieve designed structural strength, long term performance, reduced maintenance costs and
to enhance
life of roads. Compaction of soil minimizes water seepage and helps the soil to
acquire better strength. As strength increases
it is possible to reduce the pavement thickness.
Considerable economy in construction cost can, thus, be brought about. On account of better
packing of soil grains by expelling air after compaction, the permeability of soil reduces. The
densely packed soil grains do not allow water from external source to enter and hence can
resist erosion. As compaction of road embankment and the subgrade
is achieved under
fully controlled conditions, the end result
is a pavement foundation of known properties, at
least within limits. This helps the pavement designer in assessing the subgrade strength to a
reasonably accurate extent and thereby produces a safe and economical design.
2 PURPOSE OF COMPACTION
The purpose of compaction is to improve its engineering properties by increasing
its density
to make
it strong enough to resist displacement or movement under loads that may be applied
to
it.
Principal properties affected by compaction are following which are indicated
in the
Fig. 1 also.
i)
Structural strength.
ii)
Load bearing capacity.
iii)
Stability of fills.

3 MECHANISM OF COMPACTION
There are four types of basic mechanisms on which different types of compaction equipment
work (Fig. 2). These are as under:-
a)
Impact
:
It
is a large force acting for a very short interval of time (Sharp
Blow).
b)
Pressure
:
It is the force acting on unit contact area.
c)
Vibration: Shaking force.
d)
Kneading
: Manipulating or rearrangement.

4 TYPES OF COMPACTION EQUIPMENT
: COMPACTION EQUIPMENT ARE
OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES
1)
Rammer
ii)
Vibratory plate compactor
iii)
Roller
4.1
Rammer
Rammer is a device used for compaction of soil through manual or mechanised means. As
the machine hits the soil, the impact affects the hard surface below and then returns upward.
This sets all particles in motion and compaction takes place. Rammer delivers a high impact
force which
is suitable for cohesive and semi-cohesive soils. Frequency range is 500 to 750
blows per minute. Rammer gets compaction force from a small gasoline or diesel engine
powering a large piston set with two sets of springs. Rammer compacts the surface through
impact and vibration. The diagrams of the rammer powered by an engine and manual means
are shown in Fig. 3. The dimensions indicated in the diagram are the plate dimensions.

PAGE 13 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
4.2
Vibratory Plate Compactor
The vibratory plate compactor has a large vibrating base plate and
is suited for creating
a level grade. The gasoline or diesel engine drive one eccentric weight at a high speed to
generate compaction force. The engine and handle are vibration-isolated from the vibrating
plate. Vibration
is the one principal compaction
effect. The diagram of the vibratory plate
compactor is shown in Fig. 4.
The heavier the plate, the more compaction force
it generates. Frequency range
is usually
2500 vpm
to 6000 vpm.
Plate used
for bituminous mix have a water tank and sprinkler
system to prevent bitumen from sticking to the bottom of the base plate. These are used for
compacting very small areas. Vibratory plate compactor operate on low amplitude and high
frequency, designed to compact granular soils and bitumen.
Vibratory plate compactor is suitable for compaction of embankments, sub base and base
course as well as asphalt surface, where the size of the job vary from potholes to around a
thousand square metre. Light vibratory plate compactor is suitable for coarse-grained soils
compacted in thin layers. Thicker layers of coarse-grained soils require larger types of plate,
as do semi-cohesive soils. The compactor can be equipped with a water sprinkler system,
and can be used to compact small areas of bituminous surface.
Reversible Vibratory Plate Compactor
The vibrations are generated
in the plate with the help of eccentric weights rotated with
a prime mover. However,
in the case of reversible vibratory
plate compactor (shown
in
Fig.
5), there are two eccentric weights instead of one weight as
in the case of vibratory
plate compactor.
Due to their weight and force, reversible plate
is ideal for semi-cohesive
soils (mix soils).
Unlike standard plate, the reversible forward travel may be stopped and the
machine will maintain
its force for "spot" compaction.

4.3
Roller
A roller is a compactor used to compact soil, gravel, concrete, or asphalt in the construction.
Selection of roller depends on the type of application, thickness of the layer and the properties
of the material to be compacted. The material properties include grain size distribution, grain
shape, maximum grain size, water content etc. The machine parameters include the roller
weight, the compaction type (static or vibratory) and the diameter and the surface of the drum
(Sheepsfoot or smooth). The machine weight can be increased by adding water, sand/steel
inside the wheels.
4.3.1
Classification of roller
Rollers are broadly classified
into the following types depending on their utility
in different
situations.
< Three wheeled roller
-
Tandem Roller (Two wheeled roller)
b)
Sheepsfoot roller.
c)
Tamping foot roller
d)
Pneumatic tyred roller
e)
Vibratory roller (Single & Double drum)
4.3.1.1
Static roller
Static roller consists of smooth wheel drum which
is manufactured as three rolls, or tandem
roll self propelled units. The diagram of a three wheeled roller and a tandem roller are shown
in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) respectively.
It works on the principle of static pressure which is defined
as the ratio of static weight and length of contact of the rolls with the surface. Static three
wheeled roller has two driving steel rear wheels and a steering steel wheel in the front.

PAGE 15 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
Fig. 6(a) A Conventional Three-Wheeled Roller
(b) A Two-Wheeled Tandem Roller
The contact pressure exerted by the
roller helps
in
densifying the
underlying
material.
Axle load,
roll diameter and rolling speed influence the compaction performance. Axle load
measures the compaction capacity; heavier axle load have more compactive effectiveness.
Roll diameter influences surface finish. Smaller diameter roller shove material ahead of the
roil causing ridges and surface cracks. Rolling speed influences the periodicity of impacts and
the ability of the roller to keep pace with the paver. Thicker individual layers require slower
rolling speed or more passes. Thinner layers can be rolled faster or they will need fewer pass.
Smooth wheeled steel roller is generally equipped with scraper bars and sprinkling device.
It prevent material from sticking to the wheels and causing irregularities
in the compacted
surface.
The capacity of the static or smooth wheeled roller ranges from 2 to 20 Tonne which can be
increased by adding sand or water as ballast to the roll.
Three wheeled
roller has two large diameter wheels at the rear and one smaller diameter
roll at the front. The width of the front roll is greater than that of the rear roll. The diameter of
the drive wheel (Rear Roll) mounted at the rear may vary from 1.40 to 1.75 m. There
is an
overlap between the front and the rear roll. The weight distribution between the rear and the
front
roll
is
in the range of 55:45 to 60:40. Contact pressure
is lower at deeper penetration
and increases with decrease in penetration.
In the case of tandem roller, the static load per unit length (32-45 kg/cm)
is less than that of
three wheeled roller (50-80 kg/cm).
4.3.1.2
Sheepsfoot roller
Sheepsfoot
roller has metal projections of various shapes on
its
rolls for penetrating and
compacting the lower portions of a formation or sub-grade. One or more hollow steel cylindrical
drums with rows of steel studs like sheeps foot are mounted on
it. Sheepsfoot roller are slow,
have high rolling resistance and the cost of compaction per unit volume is very high.

======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
These are best suited for clayee/cohesive soils due to the small contact area of the foot and
the high loading.
A Sheepsfoot pad
is cylindrical and the pad face is circular. The pads on Sheepsfoot drums
penetrate through the top
lift and actually compact the
lift below. When a pad comes out of
the soil, fluffs the material. The result
is a loose layer of material on top. When more
fill
is
spread, the top
lift will be fluffed and the previous layer will be compacted. A sheepsfoot roller
compacts from the bottom up. The cylindrical drum can also be filled with water or sand to add
extra weight while compacting. Efficient compaction
is considered to take place when there
is a gradual "walkout" of the roller lugs with successive coverages. The important factors are
the pressure on the foot and coverage of ground obtained per pass. The parameters that
really matter are gross weight of the roller, the area of each foot, the number of lugs in contact
with the ground at any time.
The thickness of soil compacted
is generally of the order of 30 cm with a foot/lug of 20 to 25
cm. The rolling should continue
till the foot does not penetrate the surface fully. This limit is
called "walkout" on the surface.
The loose top
lift material can act as a sponge when
it rains and can slow the compaction
process. Sheepsfoot roller work normally at speeds from 6-10 km/h. Pressure and kneading
are the only compactive efforts exerted on the soil.
4.3.1.3
Padfoot roller/tamping roller
A tamping
roller consists of one or more hollow steel cylindrical drums with rows of steel
studs mounted on
it. Tamping foot compactors are high speed, self-propelled, non-vibratory
roller. The pads are tapered with an oval or rectangular face. This Roller is shown in Fig. 7.
Fig. 7 Padfoot Roller/Tamping Roller
This roller is similar to sheepsfoot roller with lugs of larger area than Sheepsfoot roller. The
static padfoot roller, also called tamping
roller, have static weights
in the range of 15 to 40

IRC:SP:97-2013
Tonne and their static linear loads are between 30 and 80 kg/cm.
It has a higher production
capacity in comparison to sheepsfoot roller.. The degree of compaction achieved is more and
there is more uniformity of density.
It operates at high speed and is capable of even breaking
large lumps.
It compacts from the bottom of the
lift to the top. But because the pads are tapered, the pads
can walk out of the
lift without fluffing the soil.
Tamping foot roller have working speeds in the range of 24-32 km/h, the forces of compaction
are due to pressure and impact which results in increase in the compaction capacity as well
as production. They are best suited for large projects.
There are also self-propelled padfoot roller weighing equal to or more than 11 tonne having a
linear load of 30 kg/cm. They can compact clay materials from 30 cm to 40 cm thickness.
4.3.1.4
Pneumatic tyred roller
Pneumatic tyred roller consists of multi axles on which a number of rubber tyre wheels are
fitted as shown
in Fig.
8. Pneumatic tyred
roller are available
in
light, medium and heavy
weights. They compact soil/bituminous mix by pressure and kneading action. The mode
of load application through the
lift tends to compact the mix from bottom to top Hence a
combination
of Pneumatic
tyre
Roller (PTR) and Tandem
Vibratory
Roller can achieve
best compaction
results. The total weight of the PTR can be increased from
11 tonne to
25 tonne or more by ballasting with steel sections or by ballasting using water, sand or pig
iron. Each manufacturer recommends his own limit for ballasting. In order to create kneading
action, the "wobble-wheel roller" where the tyres are mounted at a slight angle with respect
to axle is used. The pressure of the tyre should not increase beyond the bearing capacity of
the soil.

The combination of tyres on the rear and front axles may be even or odd. Some vertical
movement is allowed for between individual and pair of tyres to enable the roller to move on
an uneven ground while maintaining constant contact pressure.
A pneumatic tyred roller is rated
in terms of ground contact pressure. The compactive effort
can be varied by adjusting the
inflation pressure of the tyres. Care needs to be taken to
ensure that the load application
is uniform over the surface area of contact which otherwise
may lead to creation of irregular density zones in the pavements. Contact area, Gross weight,
Tyre pressure and Speed are the factors that influence the performance of the roller. Ground
contact pressure
is the essential factor in determining the compacting effectiveness of the
roller. This helps
in determining the depth to which compaction
is possible. Rolling speed
also affects the compaction time and ability to keep up with the Paver.
Pneumatic tyred roller is used on small to medium size compaction jobs, primarily on granular
materials. Pneumatic tyred roller is very effective in bituminous compaction where the design
mix has high content of fines. With large tyres and heavy wheel loads, they are capable
of considerable
penetration
of compactive
effort.
However,
this
often causes excessive
displacement of surface material and rupture cracking. The large tyres also have a tendency
to cause bouncing. The weight and high rolling resistance demand powerful prime movers,
resulting
in high cost. The kneading action of pneumatic tyred roller makes the bituminous
surface
smoother.

During compaction, the contact area of tyre changes with each pass based on the mix
material being compacted.
If the tyre sinks in to the mix material, the tyre pressure should be
reduced to have low pressure against the ground. Alternatively,
if tyre remains firm on mix
material, tyre pressure may be increased to have higher pressure against the ground. This
can be judged by the operator of pneumatic tyred roller. Central air pressure control system
provided
in the machine allows the operator to maintain a selected constant pressure on all
tyres during rolling.

Tyre inflation pressure should be regulated with compressor system fitted with the machine
between 2 kg/cm^ to 9 kg/cm^ during travel. Pressure safety valve is installed at appropriate
location. Pressure drop below 2 kg/cm^ will damage the tyre as well as the laid mat surface;
therefore same has to be maintained. Some manufacturers have made
provision
in the
machine to vary the tyre pressure as per requirement from operator's cabin during operation
of the machine.
Pneumatic tyred roller has been designed with specific feature to lock the surface particles
together and
create a
surface
seal
for smooth
riding
quality. The
technical aspects
of
pneumatic tyred roller are as under:
a)
Number of Tyres:
Self propelled pneumatic tyred
roller has odd or even
number of tyres mounted on tandem and rear axle.
b)
Type of Tyres: The compaction technology depends on tyre geometry
i.e.
tyre diameter and ply rating, and compaction characteristics. Three types of
tyres are used for this work.
i)
Flat tyres/Wide Base Tyres: These are used
at a fixed pressure of
0.4 MPa and cause less
lateral movement of particles than diagonal
tyres. These are used for surface sealing on bituminous work.
ii)
Diagonal Tyres: Industrial tyre manufacturers make diagonal and radial
tyres as standard tyres. These are more durable and can be used at
different pressures ranging between 0.3 to 0.9 MPa depending on ply
rating.
iii)
Radial tyres are preferred over diagonal tyres for pneumatic tyred roller
used on bituminous work. Front and rear wheels are connected through
different system, which prevents shoving
of the mix material during
turning. Radial tyre
is categorized under flat tyre and differs owing to
the construction of shoulder pattern. The radial pattern enables lesser
rolling
resistance,
lesser
heat
generation,
tread
stiffness
ensuring
uniform distribution of load during compaction.
c)
Tyre Overlap: There
is some gap between the tyres provided
in front and
rear tyres. This gap
is filled with the movement of tyres. To achieve uniform
compaction effect and avoid tyre marks, front and rear tyres over lap in the
gap between 30 to 50 mm. This is shown in Fig. 9.

d)
Oscillating or Pivoting Arrangement: Pneumatic tyred
roller
is provided
with oscillating/pivoting arrangement on at least one axle either on front or
rear axle.
Individual tyres fitted with this arrangement move up and down
independently of one another, provide weaving action and improve kneading
action. The combination of horizontal and vertical forces produces a kneading
effect that achieves an excellent sealing effect. Kneading action improves
bitumen pavement surface by reducing pavement permeability. This is shown
in Fig. 10.

e)
Bitumen Pickup: During
initial
rolling with pneumatic tyred
roller, there
is
much variation in temperature of tyres and mat being compacted. Therefore,
it is the tendency of tyres to pick up the mix particles at initial stage. To avoid
this, pneumatic tyred roller should be moved on the bitumen surface, which
has already been compacted and
is
still
hot. Water from sprinkler system
also prevents the pickup of mix material. Skirts around the pneumatic tyres,
restrict the contact of cold winds with tyres and keep them hot.
f)
Compactive Performance: The
level of compactive harmony between a
roller and the material
it
is expected to compact
is termed as compactive
performance. The user selects the parameters
to match
the
productive
requirements.
It
is the most important feature of pneumatic tyred
roller by
which
its compaction performance can be measured.
It is expressed
in the
following ways:
Operating Weight of Pneumatic Tyred Roller
Operating weight of pneumatic tyred roller can be increased by adding ballast on
it. Scrap
iron bars, sand or water are used as ballast. Loading and unloading of scrap iron bars is time
consuming and transportation
is also a costly affair. Sand has the tendency of drying up,
hence there is a change in operating weight depending on the atmosphere, which has to be
checked regularly.

IRC:SP:97-2013
Total operating weight of pneumatic tyred
roller
is distributed on each wheel depending
on number of wheels provided on
roller. The load on a single tyre ranges from 450 Kg to
3750
Kg. The tyre
inflation pressure and wheel
load
both
influence the ground
contact
pressure, which is depicted in the following table. For a given value of wheel load, increasing
the inflation pressure results in increase in the ground contact pressure. This is shown in the
Table 3.

Vibratory roller
A vibratory roller is an improved version of an ordinary smooth- steel roller by attaching two
rotating weights to the axle as shown
in Fig.
11. Vibratory road
roller may be towed, self
propelled or manually controlled. Self propelled
roller may have single or tandem vibrating
drums. Smooth drum vibratory compactors generate three compactive
efforts:
pressure,
impact and vibration.
Fig. 11 Smooth Drum Vibratory Roller
Vibratory Rollers are of the Following Types
a)
Towed Vibratory Roller
: The weight of the roller ranges from 4.0-6.0 Tonne
but there are heavy duty roller weighing even 15 Tonne which can be towed
with the help of a tractor or shovel as shown in Fig. 12. With the heavy roller,
the layer depth to be compacted and daily output can be increased.

Self Propelled Roller
: A self propelled
roller has a steel drum and two
pneumatic wheels
at the rear as shown
in
Fig.

Its dead weight vary
from 8-12 Tonne. This roller can be ballasted with water, wet sand or steel.
The drum drive
is provided with the hydraulic motor which provides tractive
effort.

Combination Roller
: This roller has a vibrating drum on one axle and on
the other there are pneumatic tyres as shown in Fig. 15.
It is used mostly for
bituminous work where the beneficial effect of both the vibratory roller and
pneumatic wheels are employed.

: This
is a
versatile machine (shown
in
Fig.

which can be used for a wide range of Compaction jobs eg. Compaction of
shoulder, approach roads and pathways. The static weight is in the range of
900-1500 Kg.

g)
Multipurpose Roller
: This Roller is shown
in Fig. 18. This roller is mainly
used on earth work such as Trench and sever line construction,
backfills
and
foundation work
- wherever
high demands
are
placed on
mobility,
maneuverability and simple operation under severe soil conditions.
Fig. 18 Multipurpose Roller
The vibration
is generated by one or more eccentric weights rotating on one shaft, centered
in the drum. By changing the size of the eccentric weight,
it is possible to generate different
amplitude. With this type of system the drum
will vibrate
in a revolving motion generating
"Circular amplitude". Compaction
is achieved mainly by the series of compression waves
penetrating the soil or bituminous mix
in combination with the effective static weight of the
drum. The resulting compaction force is almost vertical.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
Density results from forces generated by a vibrating drum
hitting the ground. Compaction
results are a function of the frequency of these blows as well as the force of the blows.
Working speed
is important because
it dictates how long a particular part of the
fill
will be
compacted.
For vibratory compactors, working speed from 2.0 to 6.0 km/h will provide the best results.
The machine should be able to move forward and reverse with vibration to achieve higher
productivity.
Smooth drum
vibratory compactors are used mostly
in granular
materials,
with
particle
size ranging from fine sand to large rocks. They are also used on semi-cohesive soils with
cohesive soil content up to 10%.
Effect of Characteristics of Vibratory Roller
High amplitude and low frequency are used to compact soft soils and to reach deeper zones
while low amplitude and high frequency are used for stiff soils and shallow depth. Further
High amplitude and low frequency setting is used for compaction of a thick layer whereas low
amplitude and high frequency setting
is used for the compaction of thin layer.
For example on a first pass the roller might use a high amplitude and low frequency but at the
fourth pass,
it sets itself with a low amplitude and high frequency.
The effectiveness of compaction depends upon several factors involving interaction between
the equipment and the soil being compacted. Key parameters of vibratory rollers are shown
in Fig. 22. These factors include.
a)
Operating Frequency
: Frequency control the number of impacts per metre
between the drum and mat. Each material has natural frequency under which
it vibrates or show maximum displacement of particles. Maximum compaction
occurs when
it vibrates near resonant frequency. The variation of frequency
is shown in Fig. 19. Typical values of natural frequency for different soil type
is given in Table 4.
High frequency results in tow impact space
Low frequency resuUs in wide impact space

Intelligent compaction system
This state of the art technology
is the combination of the measurement technology with the
regulation system, that uses the measured information to adapt the equipment performance
continuously to the required conditions. This system controls and automatically changes the
different compaction parameters of the
roller viz., amplitude and frequency. The modulus
measurements are made by the roller
itself. The system
is programmed with the range of
acceptable modulus values
(target value) and automatically adjusts the
roller settings to
achieve target modulus
if the readings are not within tolerance. The vibration amplitude
can be changed automatically with the help of accelerometer sensor to the machine. The
Electronic Control Unit (ECU) gives a signal regarding the amplitude as per the stiffness of
the ground. The data acquisition software with an interface will measure and record vibration
which can be used for analysis as the large data stored
in the roller computer. The roller's
speed
is controlled by the operator.
Data management
is very
critical while implementing
Intelligent Compaction
(IC). The IC
technologies such as Tracking
roller passes and overlap coverage are very useful during
poor visibility especially when working during night times and also helps in imparting uniform
compaction for full width of the road.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
The Intelligent Compaction rollers are also equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)
measurements and a documentation system that allows for continuous recording of the roller
location, number of passes and the corresponding stiffness-related output.
Furthermore such adjustments guarantee that the material
will not be "over-compacted",
the amplitude and frequency are driven down automatically when the targeted percentage
of absolute compaction
is achieved and the roller passes such a spot without vibration. This
system goes on to check possibility of under compaction, over compaction or other problems
and as a consequence goes on to offset extra expense.
Compactometer
is fitted on the roller to measure the degree of compaction. The degree of
compaction of the rolled surface is displayed on a panel in operator's cabin. The various types
of Compactometers have been designed by different manufacturers. A brief description
is as
under.
Compactometer
The Compactometer consist of the following components:
i)
A transducer bolted to the vibrating roller drum shaft to measure the change
in rebound acceleration during compaction.
ii)
An on-board computer located
in driver's cabin for processing and storing
information received from the transducer.
iii)
A printer, display unit and control panel, providing hard copy of the output for
documentation and information for the operator on compaction in progress.
Advantages of Intelligent Compaction
Intelligent compaction has the following advantages:
1)
Minimize Number of Passes, Higher efficiency and maximized productivity
by automatic control of amplitude, frequency, and speed.
2)
More uniform and optimal compaction result, better quality.
3)
Identify weak spots, Roller mapping, achieve consistent rolling patterns. Mat
temperature, and level of compaction for 100% coverage.
4)
Dynamic measurement of soil stiffness.
5)
No danger of over compaction.
6)

Compaction control
4.3.3.1
Absolute compaction
The fundamental
principle
of absolute compaction
is
that
it can
adjust
the
amplitude
and frequency of vibrations of the drum. The sensor mounted on the drum continuously
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 56
======================================================================
!RC:SP:97-2013
monitors the machine's compaction performance by sensing the
stiffness of the surface
being compacted. The signal from the sensor
is sent to the compaction meter processor,
which
in turn continuously adjusts the amplitude (up and down) depending on the stiffness
of the ground. The amplitude adjusts in such a way that areas with low bearing capacity are
compacted with high amplitude and areas with high bearing capacity are compacted with low
amplitude. The drum has an eccentric unit with a fixed weight and a adjustable weight, which
is adjustable by the system itself. In the diagram below the weights, which are red in color are
adjustable. These weights rotate relative to the shaft. The other two weights are fixed. When
both the weights are vertically opposite the amplitude of vibration is zero (Fig. 23). But when
the two weights are in line the amplitude is maximum (Fig. 24).

4.3.3.2
Relative compaction
In the case of a relative compaction the system measures and provides relative values i.e. the
system compares the index values for two successive passes with the compaction equipment
and shows the difference between values for these two passes.
It does not give the absolute
percent compaction, stiffness or density achieved. The system available as an attachment to
the roller and consist of the following main parts:
1)
Sensor (accelerometer)
2)
Processor unit
3)
Display instrument
The vibration created by an eccentric weight which
is located at the centre of the axis. The
sensor registers the vibratory movement of the roll and the information is then transferred to
the processor, where
it is analyzed. The analyzer can be fitted onto a static or vibratory roller
of a given make only. The analysed information
is presented on the display instrument as a
digital value. The compaction meter provides a relative measurement of rigidity of the surface.
This increases with increase
in the compaction and
is reflected
in rising Compaction Meter
Value (CMV). An accelerometer continuously measures the compaction forces that occur as
the vibratory drum works on the surface. The signals from the accelerometer change as the
surface becomes harder and more stable. The signals are then converted to values that can
be read on the roller's instrument panel.
Each new compaction job
is therefore initiated by compacting test areas to different levels
and in this way correlating CMV to the degree of compaction.
Compaction Analyzer registers all the CMV data and allows the operator to see the compaction
results on the computer screen. On the basis of experience or an existing calibration, the
CMV limiting value can be used for each separate compaction job. The Compaction Analyzer
then indicates which areas require additional compaction.
In some cases, the compactor
is accompanied with a GPS
in which
all the runs,
position,
utilisation of the
roller can be
documented
. The process followed
in the case of Relative compaction of soil and bitumen
are as under.
Soil Compaction
The various features of relative compaction are as follows.
a)
The compactor can be used to compact embankment, subgrade. Granular
Sub base (GSB) as per the capacity of the machine.
b)
The number of passes may
differ depending upon the type of
soil and
moisture content.
c)
Compactometer measures the compaction meter value (CMV).
It does not
measure the density but
it estimates the stiffness of the ground
in relative
terms.

d)
The accelerometer is fitted
in the drum.
It
is a sensor which calculates the
amount of drum movement from the ground which is sent to a processor and
converted into CMV value.
If the below ground
is hard then the CMV value
will be large.
e)
In case of soil compaction
if 98% density is obtained at a CMV value of 40 for
a particular soil and given
lift thickness then this CMV value is bench marked
against the achieved density. Thereafter the operator is instructed to operate
the roller until CMV value 40-45 is obtained.
Process
:
In this process a sample stretch of pavement
is selected. Thereafter
it
is
compacted with the help of a
soil compactor
. The density
is measured
independently with the help of Nuclear density guage. Simultaneously the
CMV (Compaction meter value) as indicated in the analyzer is checked. The
CMV value corresponding to the desired density
is noted and set as the
target value. For the remaining pavement, compaction is undertaken with the
objective to attain the desired CMV.
f)
In a soil compactor - accelerometer, processor, CMV indicator. Compaction
Analyser computer, GPS receiver and antennae, axle pulse sensor etc are
used to regulate data.
Bituminous Compaction
A pavement with premature failure of the asphalt base course can be seen with a weak spot
identified during mapping of the sub base course layer which could have occurred due to
incorrect frequency setting and or amplitude setting.
In-Situ
point tests are needed
in order to meet the desired
specifications. The density
measurements are done using nuclear density gauge or Non-nuclear density gauge and this
data is used to correlate the IC measurements Compaction value to establish rolling patterns.
One should be careful
in correlating data that depends upon the material,
site,
skill of the
operator at the job site and many other constructional and operational factors. Density of the
core sample (multiple samples) are correlated with compaction value to have a conclusion
of the data available from IC.
a)
The compactor can be used for compaction of all kinds of bituminous works
like
Dense
Bituminous Macadam
(DBM),
Bituminous Macadam
(BM),
Bituminous Concrete (BC) etc.
b)
In the case of tandem roller the numberof passes through the width of the lane
at a given temperature is calculated. Here a test patch of required thickness
is prepared to calculate the number of passes required
for achieving the
density for a given
lift thickness.
c)
Two temperature sensors, machine Electronic Control Unit, (ECU) interface
and vibration sensors etc. are required.

d)
The two infra red sensors measure the temperature of the bituminous surface.
The number of passes are plotted. The operator can verify from the display
unit whether the number of passes have been completed or not. The colour
of screen changes with the number of passes. This is required to achieve the
desired density. At the end of the work a summary of the Temperature range
and the passes is obtained
in the form of the report. This helps in analyzing
the compaction of the pavement.

5 BITUMINOUS COMPACTION
5.1
Method of Bituminous Compaction
Compaction of bituminous mix is usually undertaken in the following steps:
i)
Paver screed
ii)
Breakdown rolling
Hi)
Intermediate rolling
iv)
Finish rolling
v)
Traffic
i)
Paver Screed
The screed
is the first device used to compact the mat and may be operated in the vibratory
mode. There are two devices attached to the paver screed, (a) Vibration mechanism for screed
and (b) Tempering and pressure bar. All these are hydraulically operated and adjustable as
per requirements and easily achieve compaction up to 85%.
ii)
Breakdown Rolling
The rolling undertaken behind the Paver screed
is Breakdown
rolling. The density gain
is
achieved the most during breakdown rolling. This
is done with a three wheeled static roller.
The breakdown step seeks to achieve the required density within a time frame defined by
temperature constraints and consistent with paver speed. With three wheeled
roller the
operation should always progress with the drive wheel (Rear Roll) forward in the direction of
paving. This
is shown in Fig. 25. This is especially important in break down rolling since the
greatest percentage of compaction occurs during passes.

======================================================================
!RC:SP:97~2013
There are exceptions to
rolling with the drive wheel forward, however they usually occur
when superelevations are being constructed or
if the grade on which the asphalt mix is being
placed
is excessive. The exceptions occur when, due to these high grades, the drive wheel
of the roller begins to chatter on the mat, causing displacement of the mix and a very rough
surface.
In these cases the roller must be turned around to allow the Front Roll to partially
compact the material so that the drive wheel can then proceed over
it.
Hi)
Intermediate Rolling
Intermediate rolling
is required to supplement the breakdown step in achieving the required
density. Second or intermediate
rolling should closely follow breakdown
rolling while the
asphalt mix is still plastic. This can help further compact the mat or at the very least, rearrange
the aggregate within the mat to make
it receptive to further compaction
Pneumatic-tyred or Tandem vibratory roller may be used for intermediate rolling. When using
pneumatic roller, keeping the tyres hot is the most effective means of preventing pickup.
Pneumatic-tired rollers have several advantages.
1 )
They provide uniform degree of compaction.
2)
They improve the seal near the surface, thus decreasing the permeability of
the layer.
3)
They orient the aggregate particles for greatest stability, as high pressure
truck tires do after using the asphalt surface for some time.
Ground contact pressures of the pneumatic tyre should be as high as possible without
causing displacement of mix that can not be remedied
in the final
rolling. Pneumatic-tyred
roller should be used after breakdown rolling. Turning of pneumatic-tired roller on the paving
mix should not be permitted unless
it does not cause undue displacement.
Tandem Vibratory rollers- of proper static weight, vibration frequency and amplitude
- are
used to provide densities with fewer passes than static roller.
Regardless of the type of roller used, the rolling pattern should be developed
in the same
manner as for the
initial, or breakdown
rolling. This pattern should be continued
until the
desired compaction
is obtained.
iv)
Finish Rolling
The finish rolling
is done to provide a smooth mat surface.
It should be accomplished with
6-8 ton tandem or tandem vibratory (without using vibration) while the material
is
still warm
enough for removal of roller marks.
v)
Traffic
After the
roller has compacted the mat to the desired density and produced the desired
smoothness,
the new pavement
is opened
to
traffic.
Traffic loading
will
provide
further
compaction in the wheel paths of a finished mat.

5.2
Factors Affecting Bituminous Compaction
i
The following factors influence Bituminous Compaction.
i)
Compactive Effort
The following two means of densifying bituminous mix are often referred to collectively as
"compactive effort".
By applying its weight to the bituminous mix surface and compressing the material underneath
the ground contact area. Since this compression will be greater for longer periods of contact,
lower equipment speeds will produce more compaction. Higher equipment weight will also
increase compaction.
By creating a shear stress between the compressed material underneath the ground contact
area and the adjacent uncompacted material; when combined with equipment speed, this
produces a shear
rate.
Lowering equipment speed can decrease the shear
rate, which
increases the shearing stress. Higher shearing stresses are more capable of rearranging
aggregate into more dense configurations.
ii)
Temperature
Temperature of bituminous mix has an indirect effect on the viscosity of the bitumen cement
binder and thus compaction. As bituminous mix temperature decreases,
its binder becomes
more viscous and resistant to deformation, which results
in a smaller reduction
in air voids
for a given compactive effort. As the mix cools, the bitumen binder eventually becomes stiff
enough to effectively prevent any further reduction
in
air voids regardless of the applied
compactive effort. The temperature
is commonly referred to as cessation temperature,
is a
function of the mix property. The typical mix material manufacturing temperature, rolling and
laying temperatures for different bitumen penetration grades is as under (Table 5).

Mat temperature,
is crucial to the actual amount of air void reduction for a given compactive
effort, and the overall time available for compaction.
Based on data, rolling
is done to:
a)
Take maximum advantage of available roller compactive effort.
Rollers can
be used where the mat is most receptive to compaction and avoided where
the mat is susceptible to excessive shoving.
28



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
b)
Ensure the mat is compacted to the desired air void content before cessation
temperature is reached. This can be done by calculating the time
it takes the
mat to cool from initial temperature to cessation temperature. All compaction
must be accomplished within this "time available for compaction".
Factors affecting time available for compaction are:
a)
Initial Mat temperature: Higher
initial mat temperature require more time
to cool down to cessation temperature, thus increasing the time available
for compaction. However, overheating the hot mix will damage the bitumen
binder and cause emissions.
b)
Mat or
lift thickness: Thicker
lifts have a smaller surface-to-volume
ratio
and thus
lose heat more
slowly, which
increases the time available
for
compaction.
c)
Temperature of the surface on which the mat is placed: Hotter surfaces will
dissipate heat from the mat at a slower rate, increasing the time available for
compaction.
d)
Ambient temperature: Hot air temperature will dissipate heat from the mat at
a slower rate, increasing the time available for compaction.
e)
Wind speed: Wind speed affects the convective heat loss. Lower wind speed
decrease heat loss from the mat.
Additional factors affecting mat cool-down
rate are mat density, pavement layer thermal
conductivity, specific heat, convection coefficient, incident solar radiation and coefficients of
emission and absorption of solar radiation for the pavement surface.
iii)
Roller Speed
In order to provide complete and uniform mat compaction, rollers should be operated at a
slow, constant speed. Operating at high speeds will reduce compactive effort while varying
roller speed can cause non-uniform compaction. Table 6 below shows typical roller speed.
Table-6
: Typical Roller Speed Ranges
Type of Roller
Breakdown Rolling
Intermediate Rolling
Finish Rolling
Static
3.2 - 5.6 km/h
4.0 - 6.5 km/h
4.8 - 8.0 km/h
Pneumatic
4.0-6.5 km/h
Vibratory
2.0 - 6.5km/h
As mentioned previously, roller compactive effort comes in two forms: (1 ) material compression
under the ground contact area and (2) shear stress between the compressed area and adjacent
uncompressed areas. Operating at lower speeds allows the roller to remain in contact with a
particular mat location longer than
it would at higher speeds. This results in more compaction
per roller pass and therefore increases compactive effort. Speed also affects the magnitude
of shear stress developed.
29



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
Speed affects compactive
effort. Varying
roller speed
will vary compactive effort results
in
uneven compaction. This typically occurs when operators are not closely monitoring their
speed or when they speed up to
roll an area more quickly so that they can catch up to
the paver.
If rollers cannot keep up with the pace of the paving operation, they should not
be operated at higher speeds because this reduces compactive
effort. Rather, the paving
operation should be slowed down or more number of rollers should be used.
iv)
Number of Roller Passes
Generally,
it takes more than one roller pass over a particular area to achieve satisfactory
compaction. A roller pass over a specific mat area
is defined as one complete trip over the
area in question by the entire roller.
v)
Rolling Pattern
Rolling pattern may provide uniform coverage of lane being paved.
Rollers vary
in width,
and a single recommended pattern
is quite impractical. Therefore the best
rolling pattern
for each roller should be worked out and followed to obtain uniform compaction across the
lane. This
is shown
in Fig. 26, 27 and 28. The rolling pattern not only includes the number
of passes, but also the location of the first pass, the sequence of succeeding passes, and
the overlapping between passes. The
rolling operation should
start from the edge of the
spread on the low side with the roller moving forward as close behind the paver as possible.
The second movement of the
roller should be to reverse
in the same path
until the
roller
has reached previously compacted
material. At this point
it should swing over and move
forward along path number 3, again going as close as possible behind the paver. The fourth
movement
is reversal
in the third path and a repetition of the previous operation. After the
entire width of the mix being placed has been covered in this fashion, the roller should swing
across the spread to the low side and repeat the process. With this pattern, the overlap of the
roller with succeeding passes need not be more than 75 to 100 mm (3 to 4 in.)
If the
road
has
a
curb, which
prevents
the
hot asphalt mix from moving away during
compaction, rolling should start at the outer lane

IRC:SP:97-2013
Fig. 27 Rolling Pattern Behind the Paver on Roads Without a Kerb
Fig. 28 Compaction of the Mat - when Paving with Two Pavers
When paving behind two pavers, rollers should start from the outer edges toward the middle.
A strip of 30-40 cm should remain uncompacted in the middle. This joint is compacted last in
order to produce a tight bond between the two pavings.
If the new road has no curb, there
is a
risk that the
roller will push the asphalt outwards
during compaction. To avoid this, a strip of 30-50 cm should be
left non-compacted on the
unsupported sides to allow the material to cool down a little bit in order to increase its stability
for the rolling passes later.
For thick-lift construction, the rolling process should start 300 to 375 mm (12 to15 in.) from
the lower unsupported edge
until the centre portion of the spread
is compacted to some
degree of stability. Succeeding passes of the roller should then gradually progress toward
the edges of the spread. The uncompacted edge provides initial confinement during the first
pass, thus minimizing lateral movement of the mix.
After the central portion of the spread has been compacted, the mix will support the roller and
allow the edge to be compacted without lateral movement.
vi)
Bitumen Content
There are also many types and grades of bitumen. The effective bitumen binder content of
the bitumen mix affects workability and compactability. As the bitumen content increases, the
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
film thickness on the aggregate particles increases. This increased film thickness enhances
the lubricating efl'ect upto a point makes mix compaction easier.
vii)
Base Conditions
The effect of the base type and condition
is also a factor which affects the level of stiffness
or compaction achieved
in the new bitumen layer. The amount of compactive effort needed
depends, on whether the new bitumen
layer
is placed on top of the Subgrade
soil, an
aggregate base course, cold, cracked pavement layer etc.
viii)
Lift Thickness and Particle Size
In general, thick lifts of bitumen mix can be compacted more easily than thin
lifts. The thicker
the
lift, the longer the heat
is retained, and thus there
is more fime for the rolling to take
place.
6 CONCRETE COIVIPACTION
The technique for compaction of Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) and Pavement Quality Concrete
(PQC) are as under.
6.1
Compaction of Dry Lean Concrete
The compaction shall be carried out immediately after the material
is
laid and leveled.
In
order to ensure thorough compacfion which
is essential, rolling shall be confinued on the full
width
fill there is no further visible movement under the roller and the surface is closed.
Double Drum smooth-wheeled vibratory
roller of minimum 8 to 10 Tonne stafic weight
is
considered
to be suitable
for
rolling dry lean
concrete. The number of passes
required
to obtain maximum compacfion depends on the thickness of the dry lean concrete, the
compatibility of the mix, and the weight and type of the roller etc, and the same as well as the
total requirement of rollers for the job shall be determined during trial run by measuring the
in-situ density.
In addifion to the number of passes required for compacfion there shall be a preliminary pass
without vibrafion to bed the lean concrete down and again a final pass without vibration to
remove roller marks and to smoothen the surface.
Special care shall be exercised during compaction near joints, kerbs, channels, side forms
and around gullies and manholes. In case adequate compaction is not achieved by the roller
at these points, use of plate vibrator shall be made.
Segregafion of concrete
in the dumper shall be controlled by moving the dumper back and
forth while discharging the mix on
it and other means. Even paving operafion shall be such
that the mix does not segregate.

6.2
Compaction of Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC)
Slipform paver is used for constructing concrete road.
It has become indispensable in concrete
paving because of their efficiency in the production of concrete road pavement. The fast and
economically efficient process requires one single machine pass only and needs a small
operating crew compared to other construction methods.
Compaction of concrete
in slipform paver
is done by the high frequency electrical poker
vibrators placed at prefix angle. The vibrators run by 110 V, 200 Hz Generator and operate at
speeds ranging from 8000 to 12000 vpm (vibrations per minute). The diameter of the poker
vibrators
is in the range of 20-80 mm. The diameter of influence
is 900 mm and the pokers
are placed at a spacing of 36 - 50 cm to ensure proper compaction of the concrete
in the
compaction chamber. The amplitude of vibration
is
in the range of 0.4-0.8 mm. For proper
uniform compaction across the slab,
it is essential to have same frequency of all the vibrators.
The idea of compaction is to remove the air voids. This is shown in the Fig. 29.

7 SOIL COMPACTION
7.1
Properties Affected by Soil Compaction
Principal properties affected by the soil compaction include-
a)
Settlement: The reason for compacting soil
is to reduce settlement over the
life of road.
If water passes through the surface,
it increases the moisture
content of Subgrade. This weakens the Sub grade, causing the pavement
to settle and the surface to crack. Densification by compaction prevents the
settlement.
b)
Strength: Compaction increases the strength to support heavy load.
c)
Permeability: Compaction decreases voids and permeability. Increasing the
compactive effort reduces the permeability.
d)
Change
in
Volume:
Compaction
controls
undesirable volume
changes
caused by shrinkage, swelling etc.

The ultimate goal
is to construct a quality embankment/ roads
in the shortest possible time
at the least cost, and
it means that the compaction equipment must be matched with the
material. The proper compaction equipment cannot be selected until the soils are identified.
The appropriate equipment based on the material type
is mentioned below. The compacted

7.2
Factors Affecting Soil Compaction
Compaction of a soil is affected by following factors
:
i)
Compactive Effort
Compactive effort is the external force to reorient the constituent particles into a more closely
spaced arrangement to produce a corresponding increase in density. Selection of compaction
equipment depends on type of soil to be compacted. The method of compaction
is primarily
of five types such as kneading, static, dynamic, impact and vibratory compaction. Different
type of compaction
is effective in different type of soils such as for cohesive soil; Sheepsfoot
roller or pneumatic roller provides kneading action. Silty soils can be effectively compacted by
Sheepsfoot roller/pneumatic roller or smooth wheeled roller. For compacting sandy and grave!
soil, vibratory roller is most effective. The influence of vibration and amplitude on compaction
of soil
is profound. All soils have their natural frequency and
it has been suggested that the
frequency of vibration of the
roller should normally between 0.5 and
1 .5 times the natural
frequency of soil for obtaining the best compaction.
If granular soils have some fines, both
vibratory and pneumatic rollers can be used.
ii)
IVIoisture Content
Proper control of moisture content in soil is necessary for achieving desired density. Maximum
density with minimum compacting
effort can be achieved by compaction of soil near
its
Optimum Moisture Content (OMC).
If natural moisture content of the soil
is less than OMC,
calculated amount of water should be added to soil with sprinkler attached to water tanker
and mixed with soil by motor grader for uniform moisture content. When soil
is too wet,
it is
required to be dried by aeration to reach up to OMC.
iii)
Soil Type
Type of soil has a great influence on
its compaction characteristics. Normally, heavy clays,
clays and silt offer higher resistance to compaction whereas sandy soils and coarse grained or
gravel soil is amenable for easy compaction. The coarse-grained soils yield higher densities
in comparison to clays. A well-graded soil can be compacted to higher density.
iv)
Contact Pressure
In general contact pressure depends on the weight of the roller wheel and the contact area.
However
in the case of pneumatic
roller, the tyre
inflation pressure also determines the
contact pressure in addition to wheel load.
v)
Effect of Number of Passes
Density of the soil increases with the number of passes but after optimum number of passes,
further increase in density is insignificant for additional number of passes.
35



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
vi)
Effect of Rolling Speed
Speed of rolling has a very important role on the roller output. Speed is a significant factor for
vibratory rollers because slower the speed of travel, more are the vibrations at a given point
and less number of passes required to attain a given density.
vii)
Effect of Layer Thickness
The more the thickness of layer of soil subjected to field compaction, the less the energy input
per unit weight of soil and hence, less is the compaction under each pass of the roller. Suitable
thickness of soil of each layer is necessary to achieve uniform compaction. Layer thickness
depends upon type of soil involved and type of roller and contact pressure of
its drums.
Normally, 200-300 mm layer thickness
is optimum
in the field for achieving homogeneous
compaction.
8 COMPACTION OF JOINT
Compaction
of Bituminous Mix
is done as soon as
it
is placed. Compaction
is
typically
accomplished by a sequence of operations of compaction equipment. This allows each piece
of equipment to be used only in its most advantageous situation resulting in a higher quality
mat (both in density and in smoothness) that could be produced with just a single method of
compaction.
8.1
Transverse Joints
When
a
transverse
joint
is
placed
next
to
an adjoining lane, the first pass
is made
with a steel-wheel roller moving along the longitudinal joint for a short distance.
The joint
is then rolled transversely with
all except 150 mm of the wheel width on the previously laid
material.
This operation should be repeated with successive passes covering 150-200 mm
of fresh material until the entire width of a
roll
is on the new mix. During transverse rolling,
boards of proper thickness should be placed at the edge of the pavement to provide the
roller a surface to drive on once
it passes the edge of the hot bituminous mat.
If boards are
not used, the transverse rolling must stop 150-200 mm short of the outside edge in order to
prevent damage to the edge. The outside edge then must be rolled out during longitudinal
rolling. The preparation of transverse joint is shown in Fig. 31.

8.2
Longitudinal Joint
A longitudinal joint occurs
in a bitumen pavement when a fresh batch of bituminous mix
is
laid adjacent to an existing lane.
It
is the interface between the two bituminous mix mats.
Most often, differences
in the temperature and mat plasticity causes an improper bonding
of the fresh bituminous mix with the older bitumen lane and this subsequently causes the
longitudinal joint to possess a significantly lower density than the rest of the pavement. Over
time, a longitudinal crack usually occurs between the bitumen mats, permitting the intrusion
of water, increasing roughness, and potentially limiting the life of the pavement.
Based on the conditions under which the mats are laid, the resulting longitudinal joint can be
of the following types:
1)
Hot Joints: Hot joints are produced when the adjacent lanes are paved
in
echelon
i.e. when two pavers are spaced so that the first lane does not cool
significantly before the second lane is laid.
If constructed properly, a hot joint
appears almost seamless and produces the highest density when compared
to the semi-hot and cold joints. The difficulty
in obtaining hot joints
is that
it requires the simultaneous paving of multiple lanes, which
is not possible
because of constricted work zones especially in case of highways.
2)
Cold Joints: A cold joint
is produced when the first paved lane has cooled
overnight before the adjacent lane is placed to match
it. A cold joint will also
be produced
if paving of the first lane
is carried too far ahead such that the
bituminous mix has cooled. This would cause a significant density gradient
between the two mats on either side of the joint and result in very low strength
in the joint. After a short period of time under traffic, these joints tend to ravel.
In some cases, the raveling
is severe enough to completely erode the mix
at the joint. Also, the low density at this joint enables the seepage of water
into the joint which could oxidize the bituminous material. Hence, careful
attention needs to be paid to the construction of these joints.
Conventional Longitudinal Joint Compaction Techniques
a)
Rolling from the Hot Side
Running the roller on the hot mat while overlapping the joint by a distance
of approximately 150 mm
(6
in) over the cold mat
is considered the
most efficient way of compacting the longitudinal joint. Sometimes the
first pass of the roller is completed with the edge of the machine about
150 mm
(6
in) inside the longitudinal joint. The principle behind this
method of compaction
is that better compaction
is obtained when the
mix
is shoved towards the joint by the roller. No lateral movement will
occur under the roller
if the mix is stable.
b)
Rolling from the Cold Side
In this practice,
initial rolling of the longitudinal joint starts from the cold
side of the joint so that the cold mat supports most of the weight of
37

the
roller.
In contrast to
rolling from the hot side, the majority of the
compactive effort is wasted. The mix on the hot side of the joint tends to
cool down while the roller is operating on the cold side of the longitudinal
joint.
As a result, more compactive effort is needed to achieve the required
density. This method allows the roller to "pinch" the joint and obtain a
higher degree of density. However, the lane placed
first will have an
unsupported edge that is always difficult to compact.
9 COMPACTION IN SPECIAL APPLICATIONS
9.1
Compaction of Shoulder
The sequence of operations shall be such that the construction of paved shoulder is done
in layers each matching the thickness of adjoining pavement
layer. Only after a layer of
pavement and corresponding layers
in paved and earthen shoulder portion have been laid
and compacted, the construction of next layer of pavement and shoulder shall be taken up.
Where the materials
in adjacent layers are different, these shall be
laid together and the
pavement layer shall be compacted first. The corresponding layer in paved shoulder portion
shall be compacted thereafter, which shall be followed by compaction of earth shoulder layer.
The adjacent layers having same material shall be laid and compacted together.
In
all cases where paved shoulders have to be provided along side of existing carriageway,
the existing shoulders shall be excavated in full width and to the required depth.
9.2
Compaction of Embankment
The embankment and subgrade material
is spread
in layers of uniform thickness over the
entire width with the help of a motor grader. Moisture level of the layer
is checked before
compaction
in accordance with IS:2720. Compaction of the embankment
is undertaken
in
layers. Each compacted layer should not be more than 250 mm when compacted with the
help of vibratory soil compactor and not more than 200 mm when compacted with 8-1 0 tonne
Static
roller. Static three wheeled
roller, self propelled single drum vibratory
roller, tandem
vibratory
roller, pneumatic tyre
roller,
self propelled
single drum
vibratory
roller, tandem
vibratory roller, pneumatic tyre, roller, pad food roller etc. of suitable size and capacity is used
for compaction. The density of the embankment as per IS:2720 should not be less than 95
percent. Successive layer are placed after the layer under construction has been compacted
up to a level of 95 percent. Each compacted layer is finished parallel to the final cross-section
of the embankment.
9.3
Use of Compactors in Pothole Repair
All materials used for the pot-hole and patch repair of bituminous surface and underlying
layers shall be
in accordance with Specification and shall be of the same type as specified
for the original construction.
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:97-2013
A mix superior to
tine one on the existing surface may also be used for repair work. The
sequence of activities for pothole repair and compaction are as under.
a)
Preparation of the area for pot-hole and patch repair
Each pot-hole and patch repair area shall be inspected and all loose material
removed. The area shall be cut/trimmed either with jack hammers or with hand
tools suitable for the purpose, such that the defective materials responsible
for the failure
is
all removed and such that the excavation
is of a regular
shape.
b)
The edges of the excavation be cut vertically. The area shall be thoroughly
cleaned with compressed air or any appropriate method to remove
all dust
and loose particles.
c)
Layers below the
level
of the bituminous construction
shall be replaced
using material of the original construction, which shall
particularly include
the specified standards of compaction. The area for bituminous construction
shall be tacked or primed with cutback or emulsion depending upon whether
the lower area
is bituminous or granular in nature. The sides, however, are
to be painted with hot tack coat material.
d)
The mixture to be used
in bituminous patching shall be either a hot mix or
a cold mix in accordance with the Ministry's Specifications. Mixing shall be
done in a plant of suitable capacity.
The bituminous mixture
shall be placed
in
layers
of thickness
not more
than
100 mm
(loose) and
shall be compacted
in
layers with
roller/plate
compactor/hand roller/rammer to the compaction standards defined
in the
specifications.
e)
In case of potholes repaired with the help of Pothole machine based on Infra
Red technology
, where the patch is heated over a size of 2 m x 1 m, scraped
and the heated aggregates are spread over the area, emulsion
is poured
over
it and mixed manually with the help of a hand shovel
The area is then compacted with the help of a plate compactor/walk behind roller.
9.4
Compaction of Curved Surfaces
Articulated roller should be used when compacting along the edge of the carriage way. This
enables the roller driver to direct his attention to one drum when compacting the Edge. (This
is shown in Fig. 32).

10 QUALITY CONTROL
Compaction is required to be undertaken at the right temperature with the right kind of roller
for adequate number of passes to ensure that required density is obtained. The roller should
be operated
in a manner as explained
in preceding sections. However, as a check or to
exercise control over the process on each layer at least one measurement of density for each
1000 square meters of compacted area, for evaluating a day's work is required. The process
to determine the density shall be in accordance with IS: 2720 (Part-28). Test locations shall be
chosen randomly. Thereafter a mean value may be obtained from the series of observations
which may be indicative of the actual result.

12 OPERATION OF ROLLER
Following methodology should be observed in the operation of road roller.
12.1
Static Road Roller
a)
Rolling shall commence at the lower edge and proceed towards the upper
edge longitudinally for portions having
unidirectional cross
fall and super
elevation
shall commence
at the edge and progress towards the centre
having cross fall on both the sides.
b)
Each pass of the roller shall uniformly overlap 1/3rd of the track made in the
preceding pass.
42



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 56
======================================================================
!RC:SP:97-2013
c)
During rolling,
rolls should be kept moist in case of bituminous compaction
and not wet to avoid packing up of mix material by moving rolls.
d)
The motion of the roller should not be jerky during bituminous compaction.
Pneumatic Tyred Road Roller
a)
Pneumatic tyred roller should be equipped with smooth tyres of equal size, ply
in good running condition and inflated to nearly equal pressure on pneumatic
tyres such as to get uniform pressure during rolling.
b)
Desired ground pressure may be achieved by inflation/adjusting the ballast
on the roller.
c)
All wheels should
roll true without wobble.
d)
Rolling operation should commence at the outside edge of the surface and
progress towards the center or crown of the road.
e)
Each
pass
of the pneumatic
tyred
roller should
overlap
the
preceding
pass by at least
of the
roller width.
Rolling should be discontinued as
soon as uniform coverage
is accomplished and there does not appear any
unevenness.
f)
It should be ensured that all subsequent passes to achieve required density
are completed before mix temperature drops to the minimum recommended
temperature.
g)
Pneumatic tyred roller should be operated with uniform speed not exceeding
6.5
km/hr
to
prevent
the
tyres
from
displacing
or
picking
up
the
mix
material.
h)
Line of action should
neither be changed suddenly nor the
direction be
reversed at random, which will cause displacement ofthe mix. Any pronounced
change in direction should be made on stable material.
i)
If the rolling causes any displacement of pavement, the effected area to be
loosened up immediately with strike rakes and fresh mix material of original
grade placed before being rolled again.
j)
Pneumatic tyred
roller should not be allowed to stand on a finished paver
surface before
it has thoroughly cooled.
k)
During
rolling, pneumatic tyres should be kept moist and not wet to avoid
picking up of mix material by moving tyres.
I)
Intermediate rolling should be continued until
all the mix material has been
compacted thoroughly. The rolling pattern should be followed
in the same
sequence as for break down rolling.

Vibratory Road Roller
a)
Rolling shall commence at the lower edge and proceed towards the upper
edge
longitudinally for portions having
unidirectional cross
fall and super
elevation
shall commence
at the edge and progress towards the centre
having cross fall on both the sides.
b)
Each pass of the roller shall uniformly overlap 1/3rd of the track made in the
preceding pass.
c)
During rolling, rolls should be kept moist and not wet to avoid packing up of
mix material by moving rolls.
d)
High amplitude and low frequency are used to compact soft soils and to
reach deeper zones while low amplitudes and high frequencies are used for
stiff soils and shallow depth.
e)
The motion of the roller should not be jerky.
f)
The speed of the roller should be dependent on the surface of the mat being
compacted.
Initial compacting should be at low speeds. Subsequently, the
speed of the compactor may increase.
13 MAINTENANCE OF COMPACTION EQUIPMENT
The most efficient equipment are those which have lower repair costs and less downtime.
Proper maintenance system is to be followed for keeping the equipment in efficient condition.
The different types of maintenance schedule are as under.
13.1

if
the condition of the filter warrants a change.
•
Change oil in air compressor.
iii)
Semi-Annual Maintenance
•
Inspect oil filter
•
Change oil in Gear Box.
•
Tighten/Replace V-Belts.
•
Inspect Bearings.
^
•
Visually inspect the motors
•

13.3
Preventive Maintenance (PM)
Preventive
Maintenance
is
the
routine,
of scheduling
and
performing
repair
tasks on
equipment before
it becomes necessary.
Preventive Maintenance
is required
to prevent
frequent breakdown of the compactor. To attain this objective, the periodicity of the change of
spares as recommended by the supplier has to be observed. Equipment where a formalized
inspection and maintenance schedule is in place tend to have fewer breakdowns.
Preventive Maintenance should be undertaken regularly to identify the condition of bearings,
belts, and filters and the defective item may be repaired/ replaced before breakdowns interrupt
operations. Proper inventory of fast moving spares for preventive and periodic maintenance
should be maintained at site.
