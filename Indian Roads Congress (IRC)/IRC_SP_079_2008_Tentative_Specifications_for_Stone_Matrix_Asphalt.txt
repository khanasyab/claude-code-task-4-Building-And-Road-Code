TENTATIVE SPECIFICATIONS FOR STONE MATRIX ASPHALT
1. INTRODUCTION
Stone
Matrix
Asphalt (SMA) was
developed in Germany in the mid 1 960s and it
has been used successfully by many countries
in
the
world
as
a
highly
rut-resistant
bituminous
course,
both
for
binder
(intermediate) and wearing courses, for heavy
traffic
roads.
The
Flexible
Pavement
Committee
(FPC)
of
the
Indian
Roads
Congress (IRC) decided in its meeting held on
22"^*
April,
2006
that
a
specification
be
developed
for SMA
suited
to
Indian
conditions. Prof P. S. Kandhal developed the
first draft of the specification with input from
Dr. Sunil Bose. The first draft was circulated
among the FPC members for comments. The
FPC in its meeting on
9"^
September, 2006
discussed all comments in detail. The revised
draft was published
in the February, 2007
issue of the
"Indian Highways"
to
solicit
comments from users at large. The FPC in its
meeting on 5*
May, 2007 reviewed those
comments and authorized Prof P. S. Kandhal
to prepare a final draft with input from Dr. P.
K. Jain incorporating all comments. The draft
document was considered in the Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee on
26"" May, 2007 and approved. The draft was,
thereafter, approved by the IRC Council on
18"" August, 2007
subject
to modifications
keeping in view the comments of members
and approval
by the Convenor,
Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee.

2. SCOPE
This
work
shall
consist
of
construction in a single or multiple layers of
fibre-stabilized SMA
on
a
previously
prepared bituminous bound surface. SMA is
based on the concept of designing a coarse
aggregate
skeleton
so
that
stone-on-stone
contact is obtained, which provides a highly
rut-resistant
bituminous
course
for heavy
traffic
roads.
The
13 mm SMA
in
this
specification (Table 3) is intended for wearing
course with nominal layer thickness of 40 to
50 mm. The
1 9 mm SMA (Table 3 ) is intended

4.4
Selection of Trial Bitumen Content:
The initial bitumen content of the mixture for
the gradation selection phase of the design
should be a minimum 6%. It is suggested that a
good starting point be 6.0%
for mixtures with
aggregate specific gravities equal
to or less
than 2.75. If the bulk specific gravity of the
aggregate exceeds 2.75 the asphalt content can
be reduced slightly. The VMA of the mixture
must still meet the specified minimum value.
4.5
Sample
Preparation
and
Testing:
Twelve samples are required; four samples at
each ofthe three trial gradations at the bitumen
content selected above. The aggregates and
fibres should be dry mixed before adding the
bitumen.
The
mixing
and
compaction
temperatures
should
be
160°C
and
150''C,
respectively.
Three samples from each trial
gradation shall be compacted with 50 blows on
each side and used to determine the volumetric
properties of Marshall
samples. The
fourth
sample
shall
be
used
to
determine
the
theoretical
maximum
specific
gravity
according to ASTM D 2041 (see Annex B for
the outline ofthe test).
4.6
Selection of the Job Mix Gradation:
Compact
the
specimens, remove
from
the
moulds, and allow to cool. Determine the bulk
specific
gravity,
G^^^,
of
the
specimens
(AASHTO T
166). The uncompacted mix
samples are used to determine the theoretical
maximum
specific
gravity,
G^„ (ASTM D
2041). See Annex B for the outline of ASTM
D 2041. Using
G^^^
Gr„,„,
the percent air
voids (Va^, VMA, and VCA,^,„ are calculated
by the following formulae:
Voids in Mineral Aggregate,
VMA =100- [(G„,/GJ*PJ
Percent Air Voids,
V3=100*(1-G.,/G.J
Voids in Coarse Aggregate, mix,
VCA,^=100 [(G„,/GJ*PeJ

G^b
=
Bulk
specific
gravity
of

aggregate, and
G,3
=
Bulk specific gravity of the coarse
aggregate fraction.
The blend that exceeds the minimum
VMA requirement and has a VCA^,^ that
is
less than the VCA
should be selected as the
desired mix design aggregate blend. To ensure
stone-on-stone
contact
within
the
coarse
aggregate
it
is very essential that VCA^,^
is
less than VCAqrc-
4.7
Determination
of
the
Optimum
Bitumen
Content:
The optimum
bitumen
content shall be determined by corresponding
to the design air void content, V^, of4.0%. The
remaining mix properties should meet those
specified in Table 4. A good starting point for
the mix design
is 6.0% bitumen content by
weight ofmix.
4.8
Draindown Test: Draindown of the
loose SMAmix shall be determined according
to ASTM D 6390 (see Annex C for the outline
of the
test) or by the Schellenberg Binder
Drainage Test given in Annex D. The drainage
test should be performed
at the anticipated
plant
production
temperature
and
should
satisfy the specified maximum draindown of
0.30%.
If
the
mixture
fails
to
meet
this
requirement then the percent fibres should be
increased to a level that reduces draindown to
the acceptable limit.
4.9
Tensile Strength Ratio: Determine the
Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) in accordance
with AASHTO
T
283,
"Resistance
,of
Compacted
Bituminous
Mixtures
to
Moisture-Induced Damage"
following
the
freeze and thaw option. See Annex E for the
outline ofthe test.
5. SMA PRODUCTION
5.1
Mixing
:
The SMA mix
shall
be
prepared
in
a
hot mix
plant
of adequate
capacity and capable of yielding
a mix of
proper and uniform quality with thoroughly
coated aggregate.
When
viscosity
graded
VG-30
bitumen
is used, the mix temperature
shall
range
from
150"C
to
165"C.
In
case
of
polymer modified bitumen, the temperature of
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP:79-2008
mixing and compaction shall be higher than
the mix with VG-30 bitumen as binder. The
exact temperature depends upon the type and
amount of polymer used and shall be adopted
as
per
the
recommendations
of
the
manufacturer.
In
order
to
ensure
uniform
quality of mix
the plant
shall be calibrated
from time to time.
5.2
Handling Mineral Filler : Adequate
dry storage will be provided for the mineral
filler
and
provisions
shall
be
made
for
proportioning
the
filler
into
the
mixture
uniformly and in the desired quantities. This is
necessary because relatively large amounts of
mineral filler are required in SMA mixes.
5.3.
Fibre Additive: For batch plant, the
fibre
will be added directly
into
the weigh
hopper
above
the
pugmill.
Adequate
dry
mixing time
is required to disperse the fibre
uniformly throughout the hot aggregate. Dry
mixing time
will be
increased by
5
to
10
seconds. Wet mixing time shall be increased by
at
least
5
seconds.
For drum mix
plant,
a
separate fibre feeding system shall be utilized
that can accurately and uniformly introduce
fibre into the drum at such a rate as not to limit
the normal
production of mix
through
the
drum. At no time shall there be any evidence of
fibre in the baghouse/wasted baghouse fines.
6. SMA PLACEMENT AND
COMPACTION
6.1
Preparation of Existing Bituminous
Surface:
The
existing
bituminous
surface
shall be cleaned of all loose extraneous matter
by means
of mechanical broom and
high-
pressure air jet from compressor or any other
approved
equiprnxcnt/method. Any
potholes
and/or cracks shall be repaired and sealed.
6.2
Tack
Coat: A
bitumen
emulsion
complying with IS:8887 of a type and grade or
viscosity
grade
bitumen
VG-10
shall
be
applied
as
a
tack
coat
on
the
existing
bituminous
layer.
Quantity
of
liquid
bituminous material
shall vary from 0.20 to
0.30 kg/sqm in case of emulsion and 0.30 to
0.40 kg/sqm in case of bitumen. In this regard
IRC: 1 6 may be referred. The tack coat shall be
applied by a self propelled or towed bitumen
pressure
sprayer equipped
for spraying
the
bitumen binder uniformly at a specified rate.
The emulsion tack coat shall be allowed to set
(turn black from brown) before laying the hot
mix.
6.3
Transportation: The SMA shall be
transported
in
clean,
insulated
covered
vehicles. An asphalt release agent, which does
not adversely affect the bituminous mix may
be applied to the
interior of the vehicle
to
prevent sticking and to facilitate discharge of
the material.
6.4
Laying
6.4.1
Weather
and seasonal limitations:
The SMA mix shall not be laid:
•
in
presence
of
standing
water
on the surface.
•
when rain
is imminent and during
rains, fog, or dust storm.
•
when
the
base/binder
course
is
damp.
•
when
the
air temperature on the
surface on which
it is to be laid is
less
than
10"C
for
mix
with
conventional
bitumen
as
binder
and is less than
1 5°C for mix with
polymer
modified
bitumen
as
binder.
•
When
the
wind
speed
at
any
temperature
exceeds
40 km/h
at
2 m height.
6.4.2
Spreading:
Except
in
areas where
paver cannot access bituminous material shall
be
spread,
levelled
and
tamped
by
self-
propelled
hydrostatic
paver
finisher
preferably with sensor. As soon as possible
after
arrival
at
site
the
material
shall
be
supplied continuously to the paver and laid
without delay. The rate of deliver>' of material
to the paver shall be regulated to enable the
paver to operate continuously. The travel rate
of paver and the method of operation shall be
adjusted to ensure even and uniform flow of
bituminous material across the screed,
free
from dragging, tearing and segregation.
Restricted
areas
(such
as
confined
space, footways, irregular shape and varying
thickness, approaches to expansion joints etc)
where paver cannot be used, the material shall
be spread, raked and levelled with suitable
hand tool by trained staff

======================================================================
IRC:SP:79-2008
When laying SMAmix near expansion
joint,
the machine
laying
shall be
stopped
about 300 mm short of joint. The remaining
pavement up to the joint and the corresponding
area beyond it shall be laid manually.
6.5
Compaction
6.5.1
Compaction
shall
commence
immediately
after
laying
and
shall
be
cornpleted before the temperature falls below
100 C. Rolling of the longitudinal joints shall
be
done
immediately
behind
the
paving
operation.
After
this,
the
rolling
shall
commence at the edge and progress towards
the
center longitudinally except
at
sections
with
unidirectional
camber, where
it
shall
progress
from
lower
edge
to
upper
edge
parallel to centerline ofthe pavement.
6.5.2
All
deficiencies
in the
surface
after
laying shall be made good by the attendant
behind
the
paver,
before
initial
rolling
is
commenced. The initial or breakdown rolling
shall be done with the 8
to
10 tonnes dead
weight or vibratory
steel wheel
roller. The
intermediate rolling shall also be done with 8
to 10 tonnes dead weight or vibratory roller.
Pneumatic rolling shall not be used on SMA
because of potential pickup problems. The
finished rolling shall be done with 6 to 8 tonne
smooth wheel roller. Rolling shall continue till
all
the
roller marks
are removed from
the
surface
and
the minimum
specified
field
density is achieved.
6.5.3
The SMA mix
shall be rolled
in the
longitudinal direction, with the roller as close
as
possible
to
the
paver.
The
overlap
on
successive passes should be at least one-third
of the width of the
rear wheel. The
roller
should move
at a speed of not more than 5
km/h. The roller shall not be permitted to stand
on
pavement,
which
has
not
been
fully
compacted. All precautions shall be taken to
prevent dropping of oil, grease, petrol or other
foreign material on the pavement. The wheel
ofthe rollers shall be kept moist with the water
or spray system provided with the machine to
prevent
the
mixture
from
adhering
to
the
wheels.
Minimum
moisture
to
prevent
adhesion between wheels and mixture shall be
used and surplus water shall not be allowed to
stand on the partially completed pavement.
6.5.4
The density ofthe finished paving layer
shall be detemiined by taking
1 50 mm diameter
cores. The density offinished paving layer shall
not be less than the 94% ofthe average (sample
size
N=2)
theoretical
maximum
specific
gravity of the loose mix (G,^,„) obtained on that
day in accordance with ASTM D204 1
. That is,
no more than 6% air voids shall be allowed in
the compacted SMA mat. See Annex B for the
outline ofASTMD 2041.
6.6
Joints
6.6.1
Where joints are made, the material
shall be fully compacted and the joint made
flush in one ofthe following ways.
6.6.2
All joints shall be cut vertical to the
full thickness of the previously laid mix. All
loosened material shall be discarded and the
vertical
face be coated with any
viscosity
grade bitumen
or
cold
applied
emulsified
bitumen
or
rubberized
asphalt
tack
coat
(minimum thickness 3 mm), prior to laying
the
adjacent
lane.
While
spreading
the
material along the joint the material spread
shall
overlap
25 mm
to
30 mm
on
the
previously laid mix beyond the vertical face
of the joint. The thickness of the loose overlap
material should be approximately a quarter
more than the final compacted thickness. The
overlapped mix should be bumped back with
a lute just across the joint so that the excess
material on the hot side can be pressed to
obtain a high joint density.
6.6.3
By
using
two
or more
pavers
in
echelon,
where
this
is
practicable
and
in
sufficient proximity for adjacent width to be
fully compacted by continuous rolling.
6.6.4
By heating thejoints with an approved
infrared joint heater when the adjacent lane is
being laid, but without cutting back or coating
with
the
binder. The heater
shall
raise the
temperature of the full depth of material, to
minimum rolling temperature for a width of
75 mm. The temperature
shall not exceed
6.6.5
For
transverse
joints,
the
method
suggested in Section 6.6.2 can be adopted. In
multi-layer construction, the joint in one layer
shall offset the joint in the underlying layer by
about 150 mm. However the joint in the top
layer
shall be along the
centre
line of the
pavement.

least 25 mm
larger than the
diameter ofthe measure.
C.
Testing Procedure
1.
Calibrate the measure and determine
its capacity in mm^ by filling
it with
water and covering with plate glass to
eliminate
air
bubbles
and
excess
water. Determine the mass ofwater in

of ASTM D
2041, "Theoretical
Maximum Specific Gravity and Density of
Bituminous Paving Mixtures"
A.
Scope and Summary of the Test
Method
This
test
method
covers
the
determination
of
the
theoretical
maximum
specific
gravity
and
density of uncompacted bituminous
paving
mixtures
at
25"C.
The
theoretical maximum specific gravity
(G^„)
is
used:
(a)
to
calculate
air
voids
in
compacted
bituminous
mixtures, (b) to calculate the amount
of
bitumen
absorbed
by
the
aggregate, and (c)
to provide target
value for the compaction of paving
mixtures in the field.
A sample of loose paving mixture
is
placed
in
a
tared vacuum
vessel.
Water at
is added to completely
submerge
the
sample. A
specified
amount
of vacuum
is
gradually
applied
to remove
the
air bubbles
entrapped
between
asphalt
mix
particles.
After
the
vacuum
is
released, the volume of the sample of
the
voidless
paving
mixture
is
obtained
by
either
immersing
the
vacuum container with the sample in
a
water
bath
and weighing
or by
filling
the
calibrated
vacuum
container

Compacted Asphalt Mixtures to Moisture-
Induced Damage"
A.
Scope
and
Summary
of
Test
Method
This method
covers
preparation
of
compacted bituminous mixtures and
the measurement of the change
of
diametral
tensile
strength
resulting
from the effects of water saturation
and laboratory accelerated stripping
phenomenon
with
a
freeze-thaw
cycle.
The
result may
be
used
to
predict
long-term
stripping
susceptibility of bituminous mixtures
and
evaluate
liquid
anti-stripping
additives that are added to bitumen or
pulverized mineral materials such as
hydrated lime, which are added to the
mineral aggregate.
Each set of 6 compacted specimens is
divided into two equal subsets. One
subset
is tested
in dry condition for
indirect
tensile
strength. The
other
subset
is
subjected
to
vacuum
saturation
and
a
freeze-thaw
cycle
(thawing in a hot water bath) before
testing
for
indirect
tensile
strength.
Numerical indices of retained indirect
tensile
strength
properties
are
calculated from the test data obtained
by testing the two subsets viz. dry and
conditioned.

7.
Steel
loading
strips with
a concave
surface having a radius equal to the
normal
radius of the
test specimen.
The loading strips shall be 12.7 mm
(0.5 inch) wide for specimens
1 00 mm
(4
inches)
in diameter. The loading
strips for 150 mm (6 inches) diameter
specimens
shall be
19.05 mm (0.75
inch) wide. The length of the loading
strips shall exceed the thickness of the
specimens. Steel strips are provided at
the
top
and
bottom
of specimens
during indirect tensile testing.
C.
Testing Procedure
'
1
.
Make at least 6 compacted specimens
for each mixture, 3 to be tested dry and
3 to be tested after partial saturation
and
moisture
conditioning
with
a
freeze-thaw
cycle.
Some
extra
specimens
will need
to be made
to
establish
compaction
procedures
in
order
to
obtain
specified
air
void
contents in the test specimens by trial
and error.
2.
Compact
the
6
specimens
with
a
Marshall
compactor
so
that
the
compacted specimens have air voids
of 7.0±0.5%. This
level of high
air
voids can be obtained by adjusting the
number of Marshall blows applied on
each side of the specimen by trial and
error
(start
at about
10 blows
as
a
starting point). Air void content must
be calculated from the bulk specific
gravity of the compacted specimen
(determined by saturated surface dry
method as per procedure given in the
Asphalt
Institute
MS-2)
and
the
maximum theoretical specific gravity
of
the
loose
bituminous
mixture
obtained byASTM D 2041.
18



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:79-2008
3.
Separate
the
6
specimens
into
2
subsets so that the average air voids of
the
two
subsets
are
approximately
equal.
4.
One set will be tested dry. Keep
it at
room temperature and then place in a
25"C±0.5T
water bath
for 2
hours
prior
to
determining
their
indirect
tensile strength.
5.
The other subset will be conditioned
as follows:
(a)
Place and submerge the 3 specimens
in the vacuum container
filled with
water at room temperature. Apply a
vacuum
of
13-67
kPa
absolute
pressure
(10-26
inche
Hg
partial
pressure) for 30 minute. Remove the
vacuum
and
leave
the
specimens
submerged
in
water
for
5
to
10
minutes. [Note: The water saturation
procedure noted above deviates from
AASHTO T
283,
which
obtains
a
specified
degree of saturation. The
above procedure keeps
the time of
saturation constant.]
(b)
Wrap
a
plastic
film
around
each
saturated
specimen
and
place
the
wrapped specimen
in a
plastic bag
containing
1 0 ml of water and seal the
plastic bag. Place the plastic bag in a
freezer at temperature of
18*'C±3"C
for a minimum of 16 hour. Remove
the specimens from the freezer.
(c)
Place the specimens in a water bath
maintained at 60'^C±l"C for 24 hour.
Remove the plastic bag and the plastic
film from each specimen after placing
the specimens under water.
(d)
Remove the specimens from hot water
bath
and
place
in
a
water
bath
maintained
at
25'C+0.5'C
for
2 hour.
(e)
Remove
the
conditioned specimens
and test for indirect tensile strength.
6.
Determine the indirect tensile strength
of
the
3
dry
and
3
conditioned
specimens
at
25''C±0.5"C
after
removing
from
water
bath.
First,
measure
their mean thicknesses
(t).
Then place the two steel loading strips
on
the
bottom
and
top
of
the
specimens across diameter and place
in the Marshall testing machine or a
compression-testing machine. Apply
load to the specimens diametrally at a
vertical rate of50 mm per minute.
7.
Record
the maximum
compressive
strength noted on the testing machine
and continue loading until a vertical
crack
appears
in
the
specimen.
Remove the cracked specimen from
the machine and visually estimate the
approximate
degree
of
moisture
damage
(extent of stripped
or bare
aggregate) on the fractured faces of
the specimen on a scale of 0 to 5 (5
being the most stripping).
8.
Calculate the tensile strength of each
specimen as follows in SI units:
St = 2000P/7itd
Where,
St
=
tensile strength, kPa
P
=
maximum loads, N
t
=
specimen thickness, mm
d
=
specimen diameter, mm
9.
Express
the
numerical
index
of
resistance of bituminous mixture
to
the detrimental effects of water as the
ratio of the original strength that
is
retained
after
accelerated
moisture
and freeze-thaw conditioning.
Calculate
the
tensile
strength
ratio
(TSR) as follows:
TSR = S,/S,
Where,
'^^^^i^
-
'
S,
=
average
tensile
strength
of
the
dry
subset, kPa
S2
= average
tensile
strength
of
the
conditioned
subset,
kPa
