RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR THE DESIGN
AND LAYOUT OF CYCLE TRACKS
1
INTRODUCTION
Cyclists,
using
the
carriageway
along
with motor vehicles
and other road
traffic, cause hazards for themselves and for
others
and
impede the free
flow of
traffic.
This
is
particularly
so when
cycle traffic
is heavy.
Under such circumstances,
it is necessary to
segregate cyclists
from other
traffic.
With this
end
in
view, the
following principles have been laid down
by
the
Specifications &
Standards
Committee of the
Indian
Roads
Congress for
general
adoption.
2.
SCOPE
The recommendations contained in this
Standard are
applica
ble to cycle tracks built along roads or independently of them.
3.
DEFINITION
A cycle track
is a
way or a
part of a
roadway
designed
and
constructed for the use of pedal bicycles,
and over which a right-of-
way exists.
4.
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROVISION OF CYCLE
TRACKS AND THEIR CAPACITY
4. 1 .
Justification
Separate cycle
tracks may be
provided
when
the peak hour
cycle traffic is
400 or more, on
routes
with a
traffic of
100 motor



======================================================================
PAGE 8 of 14
======================================================================
IRC: 11—1962
vehicles or more
but
not
more
than
200
per
hour.
When
the
number of motor vehicles using the route
is more than 200 per hour,
separate cycle tracks may be justified even if the
cycle traffic
is only
100 per hour.
4.2.
Capacity
As a general rule the capacities of
cycle tracks may
be taken
as given below
:
Capacity in number of cycles per day
One-way traffic
Two-way traffic
Two lanes
2,000 to 5,000
500 to 2,000
Three lanes
over 5,000
2,000
to
5,000
Four lanes
—
Over 5,000
5.
TYPES
5.1.
Cycle tracks are classified into the following two groups:
I.
Cycle tracks which run parallel to or along a main carriage-
way.
These are further sub-divided into three classes:
{a)
Adjoining cycle tracks
:
These
completely
fit in with the
carriageway and
are
adjacent to
and
on the
same level
with
it.
{b) Raised
cycle
tracks
:
These
are
also
adjoining
the
carriageway but are at a higher level.
(c) Free cycle tracks
: These are separated from the carriage-
way by a
verge and
may be
at
the
same
level
as
the
carriageway or at a different level.
II.
Those cycle tracks which are
constructed independent of
any carriageway.
Note
:
A free
one-way cycle
track on each
side of the
carriageway is to be
preferred.
Adjoining
cycle
tracks
should not be provided as far as
possible.

6.
HORIZONTAL CURVES
As far as possible,, a
cycle track
should
be
so
aligned
that
the
radii
of
the
horizontal
curves are
not
less
than
10 metres
(33
ft).
Where the
track has a
gradient
steeper
than
1 in 40, the
radii of the horizontal curves should not
be less than 15
metres (50
ft).
Subject to the above mentioned minimum
standards the radii
of horizontal curves for independent cycle tracks should
be
as large
as practicable.
7.
VERTICAL CURVES
Vertical curves at
changes in
grade
should have a minimum
radius of 200
metres (656 ft)
for
summit
curves and
100
metres
(328 ft) for valley curves.
8.
GRADIENTS
8.1.
The length of grades should not exceed the following:
Gradient
Maximum
length
Metres
(ft)
1
in X
(Y)
1
in 30
90
(295)

(410)
1

160
(500)
1

(656)
1

(820)

(1,640)

8.2.
The value of the maximum length may be approximately
obtained from the formula —
10
where 7— the maximum length in metres, and
A'=the reciprocal of the gradient
(expressed as
1
in X)
8.3.
Gradients steeper than
1
in 30 should generally be avoid-
ed.
Only in exceptional
cases,
gradients
of
1
in 20 &
1
in 25 may
be allowed for lengths not exceeding 20
metres (65 ft) &
50 metres
(164 ft) respectively.
8.4.
Where the gradient of a
carriageway
is too
steep for a
parallel cycle track the latter may
have to be
taken
along a detour
to satisfy the requirements of this standard.
9.
SIGHT DISTANCES
It
is desirable that a
cyclist
should
have a clear
view
of not
less than 25 metres (82 ft).
In the case of
cycle tracks
at gradients
of
1 in 40 or steeper,
cyclists should
have a
clear
view of not less
than 60 metres (197
ft).
10.
LANE WIDTH
The width of a
cycle at the
handle
bar, the widest portion,
ranges from 45 centimetres to 50 centimetres (1
ft 6 in. to
1
ft 9 in).
It
is
generally not
possible for a
cycHst to
drive
in
a
perfectly
straight path.
Therefore, allowing for a clearance of 25 centimetres
(9 in.) on either side, the total width of pavement
required for the
movement of one cycle is one metre (3
ft 3
in.).
11. WIDTH OF PAVEMENT
The minimum width of pavement for a cycle track
should not
be less than 2
lanes,
i.e.,
2
metres
(6
ft 6 in.).
If
overtaking is
4



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 11-1962
to be provided for,
the
width
should be made
3
metres
(9.8 ft).
Each additional lane
where
required
should be
1 metre (3
ft 3 in.)
wide.
12.
CLEARANCE
Vertical clearance.
The minimum head-room provided should
be 2.25 metres (7.38 ft).
Horizontal
clearance.
At
underpasses
and
similar
other
situations a side clearance of 25 centimetres
should be
allowed
on
each side.
The minimum width
of an
underpass
for a
two-lane
cycle track would, therefore, be 2.5
metres
(8.2
ft).
In such situa-
tions
it would be desirable to increase the head-room by another 25
centimetres so as to provide a total vertical
clearance of 2.5 metres
(8.2 ft).
13.
CYCLE TRACKS ON BRIDGES
Where a road provided
with
cycle tracks
goes over a
bridge,
full width cycle
tracks
should
be
provided
over
the
bridge also.
Where the cycle track
is located immediately
next to bridge railing
or parapet, the height of
the
railing or
parapet
should be kept 15
centimetres higher than required otherwise.
14.
GENERAL
.
14.1.
It is desirable that cycle
tracks
should be provided on
both sides of a road and should be separated from the main carriage-
way by a verge or a berm of as much width
as
possible, the mini-
mum width of the verge being
1 metre (3 ft 3 in.). Under exceptional
circumstances, e.g., in towns where the width of the road land (right-
of-way)
is inadequate, the width of the verge may be reduced to 50
centimetres (20 in.). For a width of 50 centimetres (20 in.) from the
edge of the pavement of the cycle track, the verges or berms should
be maintained so as to be usable by cyclists in an emergency.
14.2.
Wherever
possible,
cycle
tracks
should
be
located
beyond the hedge, tree line, or footpath. In shopping
centres, how-
ever, footpaths should be nearest to the shops.

IRC: 11-1962
14.3.
Cyclists are
influenced
considerably
by
obstructions
near the side of the
cycle
track,
like
kerbs,
hedges,
ditches, tree
roots, etc.
Kerbs should be avoided as far as possible. A clearance
of at least 50 centimetres should be
provided near hedges
and of
1
metre from trees or ditches.
15. ROAD CROSSINGS
Where a cycle track crosses a road, the carriagev^ay
should be
marked with appropriate road markings.
16.
RIDING SURFACE AND LIGHTING
To attract
cychsts to
use a
cycle
track,
it is
essential
that
cycle tracks should be
constructed and
maintained
with
care and
1, should have riding qualities and lighting standard equal to or
better
' than those of the main carriageway.
