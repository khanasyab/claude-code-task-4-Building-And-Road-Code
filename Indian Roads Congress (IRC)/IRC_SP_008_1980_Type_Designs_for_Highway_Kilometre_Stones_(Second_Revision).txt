TYPE DESIGNS FOR HIGHWAY KILOMETRE STONES
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The standard on Kilometre Stones was publislied by
the
Indian
Roads
Congress originally in
1960.
It was reviewed by the
Specifications and Standards Committee (personnel given on
inside
front and back cover) in October, 1979 with respect to the language
of inscription and certain modifications were made.
1.2.
The revised standard
incorporating
these
changes
was
approved by
the Council of Indian Roads Congress at their meeting
held at Gauhati on
28th
October,
1979
and
is recommended
for
adoption on
all roads in the country.
2.
DESIGN OF KILOMETRE STONES
2.1.
Kilometre stones shall correspond to the
Type
Designs
shown in Plates
1, 2 and
3.
2.2.
On
National
Highways,
State
Highways
and
Major
District Roads, the kilometre stones used shall have two sizes:
(i) "ordinary kilometre stones" of smaller size vide Plate
1; and
(ii)
"fifth kilometre stones" (i.e. kilometre stones
installed
after
every
five kilometres) of bigger size vide Plate 2.
2.3.
On Other District Roads and
Village
Roads,
the
kilo-
metre stones shall be uniformly of one size as shown in Plate 3.
3.
MATERIALS
3.1.
Kilometre stones may
be made
of
suitable
materials,
available locally, such as hard stone, cement concrete etc.
4.
SCRIPT AND SEQUENCE OF INSCRIPTION
4.1.
Ordinary kilometre stones put up on National Highways,
State Highways
etc. (vide Plate
1) shall be inscribed either in Hindi
or local language and indicate the name and
distance
to
the
next

important
(i.e.
intermediate)
town
or the terminal/starting station
as the case may be (see para 4.2).
Fifth kilometre
stones,
on
the
other
hand,
shall
be inscribed only in Roman and show the name
and distance of the terminal/starting station as well as of
the
inter-
mediate town (see para 4.2 and Plate 2).
4.2.
The
place
names
shall
be inscribed in different scripts
in the following sequence, only one script
being
used
on
any
one
kilometre stone:

and so on, repeated in the same order.
4.3.
The above
order
and
weightage
of
a
script may
be
modified
by
the
Road
Authority
if
considered
necessary.
For
instance, where local script happens to
be
the
same
as
Devnagri,
instead
of
the
sequence
for
ordinary
kilometre
stones
given
in
para
4.2,
the
kilometrage
to
the
next
important
town
and
the
terminal/starting station could be shown on alternate stones.
4.4.
On kilometre stones fixed on Other
District
Roads
and
Village
Roads,
the
inscription may be in the official language (:.e.
Hindi in Devnagri script) or the
script
of
the
recognised
regional
language
at
the
discretion of
the local Road Authority.
Inscrip-
tion in Roman script
is not necessary
unless
the
road
leads
to
a
place of tourist or archaeological interest
or
there
are
other
good
reasons.

4.5.
In
every
case,
the
numerals on kilometre stones shall
be inscribed in the international form
of
Indian
numerals.
Local
or Devnagri numerals shall not be used vide Article
343
(i)
of
the
Constitution of India.
4.6.
On each kilometre stone,
its number^'' shall be
inscribed
on
the
side of the stone facing the carriageway (see Plates
1, 2 and
3).
In case of thin stones made of
R.C.C. or some
other material,
the digits may be inscribed one below the
other
starting
from
the
top.
Thus 426 will be shown as:
5.
SIZE, SHAPE AND SPACING OF LETTERS/NUMERALS
5.1.
Letters and numerals on
kilometre
stones
shall
be
of
following size:
5.2.
Shapes and dimensions of standard
letters/numerals for
the above sizes are given in Plates 4 and
5.
For long place names,
the thickness of
letters
and
the
spacing
between
them may
be
reduced suitably,
however
without
making
any
change
in
their
height.
5.3.
When
inscribing
letters
or
numerals,
all
characters
having an arc at top or bottom should be
extended
slightly
above
or below the line of the other
letters/numerals.
This
is
in
accor-
dance with the accepted practice for rounded letters and numerals.
5.4.
Recommended
spacing
between
adjacent
letters/
numerals
is given in
Table
I,
and
for
any
combination
can
be
worked out through a two-step
process
described
in
the
footnote
This
numbering
is
meant
for
the
use
of
maintenance
staff and
will start
with zero at the starting station, increasing
progressively
upto
the
last
kilo-
metre stone at the terminal station.

This space
is the distance measured
horizontally
between the extreme
right
edge
of
the
preceding
letter/numeral
and the extreme left edge of the following letter/numeral.
No part
of any letter/numeral may extend into this space.
The
other
edge
clearances should be as given below
:
5.5.
On kilometre stones inscribed in a language
other
than
Roman, the style of lettering shall be the one in general
use.
The
spacing between single or compound
letters shall be
at
least
equal
to the thickness of the vertical
strokes/or the
thickness
of
strokes
of letters in
case
of
scripts
having
no
vertical
strokes
(such
as
Oriya, Telugu and Kannada).
6.
COLOUR OF BACKGROUND AND OF THE INSCRIPTION
6.1.
The background colour shall be white
with black
letters

of
stations
and
distances.
The
semi-
circular portion of kilometre stones shall be painted
canary
yellow
(TS.

309)
on
National
Highways,
brilliant
green
(I.S.
Shade
221)

Major
District
Roads.
Route numbers written on the semi-circular
portion
shall
be in black colour on canary yellow and white backgrounds, and in
white colour on brilliant green background.
7.1.
Normally kilometre stones shall be located on
left-hand
side of the road as one proceeds from the station
from
which
the
kilometre count starts.
On divided roads having a central median,
kilometre stones should be provided at
the
left
on
both
sides
of
the road
i.e. independently for each direction of travel.
7.2.
Kilometre stones shall be fixed
at
right
angles
to
the
centre line of the carriageway.
On
embankments,
these
shall
be
located
on
the
edge
of
the
roadway
beyond
the
shoulders,
if

cut
sections,
these
shall be fixed clear of
the
shoulders
as

that
code number

desired
letter
or
numeral
height.
Spacing
is
