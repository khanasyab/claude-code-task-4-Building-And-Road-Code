Terminology
Access Aisle - An accessible pedestrian space between elements, such as parking spaces, 
seating and desks that provides clearances appropriate for use of the elements.
Accessible - A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with the guidelines given in 
this Manual and that can be approached, entered and used by all people.
Accessible Route - A continuous unobstructed path connecting all accessible elements and 
spaces in a building or facility that can be negotiated by persons with disabilities. Exterior 
accessible routes may include parking, access aisles, kerb ramps, walkways and ramps. Interior 
accessible routes may include corridors, ramps, elevators, lifts, and clear floor space at fixtures.
Accessible Signage - Any visual way finding system incorporates architecture, landscape 
design, lighting, landmarks and orientation points. Signage is one key element of an effective 
way finding system and should be accessible to all users.
Automatic Door - A door equipped with a power operated mechanism and controls that open 
and close the door automatically upon receipt of a momentary signal. The switch that begins 
the automatic cycle may be photoelectrical device, floor mat, sensing device, or manual switch 
mounted on or near the door itself.
Beveled - Smooth, slanted angle between two surfaces; for example, a slant or inclination 
between two uneven surfaces to allow easy passage of a wheelchair.
Braille Signage - Is a specialist way-finding device that incorporates Braille as a primary source 
of information for people who are visually impaired and may be aided with raised tactile lettering, 
maps or pictorial photos.
Braille - Braille system is a method that is widely used by persons with visual impairments to 
read and write.
Circulation Path - An exterior or interior way of passage from one place to another for pedestrians, 
including walkways, hallways, courtyards, stairways and stair landings.
Clear - Unobstructed, without any obstruction.
Color Contrast - The basic guidelines for making effective color choices are based on the hue 
value of the colors. The most commonly used methods of achieving color contrast incorporate 
either ‘harmonizing’ or ‘contrasting’ color combinations.
Disability - An umbrella term for impairments (WHO, 2004), activity limitations, and participation 
restrictions, denoting the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health 
condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors). Disability 
is neither simply a biological nor a social phenomenon but arises from the relationship between 
health condition and context.
Footpath (Sidewalk) - A footpath is a path for pedestrians that are situated alongside a road 
or a paved pathway. Footpaths should be regarded as a transportation system/network, which 
is connected and continuous, just like roadways and railways. They should not be sporadically 
placed, but instead should be provided consistently.

IRC:SP:117-2018
v
Grab Bars - A bar used to give a steadying or stabilizing assistance to a person engaged in a 
particular function.
Handrails - A rail used in circulation areas such as corridors, passageways, ramps and stairways 
to assist in continuous movement.
Hue - The perceptual attribute associated with elementary color names. Hue enables us to identify 
basic color categories such as blue, green, yellow, red and purple. Persons with normal color 
vision report that hues follow a natural sequence based on their similarity to one another. With 
most color deficits, the ability to discriminate between colors on the basis of hue is diminished.
Accessible Washrooms (toilets) - A compartment having the basic requirements of a water 
closet compartment, wash basin and other essential washroom accessories as required by 
persons with disabilities.
International Symbol of Accessibility - The International Symbol of Accessibility consists 
square overlaid with a stylized Photo of a person using a wheelchair. The symbol is often seen 
where access has been improved, and the symbol denotes a barrier free environment for persons 
with disabilities, older people, parents with prams, and travelers with luggage. The wheelchair 
symbol is “international” and therefore not accompanied by Braille in any particular language.
Kerb (curb) - A raised edge along a road with a footpath, road median or road shoulder.
Kerb Ramp - A short ramp cutting through a kerb or built up to it, with footpath, at a gradient no 
greater than 1:10 on both sides of necessary and convenient crossing points.
Knurled Surface - Brush texture, often in a crisscross pattern; used on either door knobs or 
grab bars. On door knobs, it is used to provide tactile clues to persons with visual impairments 
to indicate that passage leads to an area of danger. On grab bars, it is used to improve grasp 
and to prevent slipping.
LRV - Light Reflectance Value (LRV) is the total quantity of visible light reflected by a surface at 
all wave lengths and directions when illuminated by a light source.
Luminosity Contrast - Also known as tonal contrast is an important element that assists persons 
with visual impairments to distinguish between two different surfaces. A minimum difference of 
26 points in the LRV of colors of two architectural surfaces produces an adequate luminosity 
contrast that is perceivable by persons with visual impairments.
Lux - Standard unit of illumination. It is used as a measure of perceived intensity of light.
Operable Parts - A part of a piece of equipment or appliance used to insert or withdraw objects, 
or to activate, deactivate, or adjust the equipment or appliance (for example coin slot, pushbutton, 
handle).
Passing Places - A space on footpath, single track road or one lane road that permits two ways 
travels when it is not wide enough to allow wheelchairs/vehicles to pass one another.
Persons with Disabilities - A person with disability is a person with any physical, mental, 
intellectual or sensory impairment which in interaction with various barriers may hinder full and 
effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. The term “persons with disabilities”,

vi
consistent with the terminology used in the United Nations CRPD, is used throughout these 
guidelines.
Persons with Reduced Mobility - such as senior citizens; families with young children; 
unescorted children; persons with temporary ailments, medical conditions and hidden diseases; 
pregnant women; persons carrying heavy luggage and people with communication problems 
(including different linguistic and ethnic groups like migrants, tourists etc.).
Public Use - Describes interior and exterior rooms or spaces that are made available to the 
general public. Public use may be provided at a building or facility that is privately or publicly 
owned.
Ramp - An inclined pathway connecting one level with another.
Signage - An object containing a printed message and/or symbol. Signage and signs are used 
synonymously in this document.
Space - A definable area (for example, toilet room, hall, assembly area, entrance, storage, room 
alcove, courtyard, or lobby).
T able T op - Road raised to footpath/footway level at crossing or with leveled.
T actile - Means information and interpretations derived from the sense of touch. This involves 
sensory transfer through physical contact of the hands or feet with other surfaces, as well as 
sensory transfers received by contact with non-physical elements such as pressure, wind and 
temperature.
T actile Paver/T iles (T actile Ground Surface Indicators) - Provide a distinctive surface pattern 
of “strips” and “truncated domes” or cones (which are small domes or cones that have had their 
tops cut off, or truncated) detectable by long cane or underfoot which are used to guide/alert 
persons with visual impairments of their approach to facilities, streets and hazardous drop-offs. 
People with visual imapirements are alerted of impending danger from vehicle impact or a grade 
change.
T actile Signs (Refer also to Braille Signage) - Incorporates raised text or symbols to enable 
touch reading by people who are blind, and touch enhancement of visual perception for people 
who are visually impaired.
Traffic Island - Can be a median strip, a strip in the middle of a road. It can also be a narrow 
strip between roads that intersect at an acute angle. Some traffic islands may serve as refuge 
islands for pedestrians.
Universal Design - Defined as “the design of products and environments to be usable by all 
people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design”.
Vision Impairment - Is any significant loss of sight.

Chapter 1 
Introduction
The Government of India aim to create world-class roads and smart cities infrastructure  in 
the country. Fundamentally, good design addresses user abilities, needs and preferences, 
using technology to put users’ needs first.  In year 2016, the Government of India enacted the 
rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and signed and ratified the UN Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Prelude to this all stakeholders need to understand 
and implement universal accessibility in its holistic sense. The guiding principle of ‘universal 
accessibility’ is to create obstacle-free environment. It encompasses broad-spectrum ideas to 
create accessible and inclusive roads and streets and pedestrian environment i.e utilization of 
all the facilities to the fullest by ALL people” i.e. use is more important and not restricted only 
to reach. Improved accessibility allows for greater use of Non-Motorized Vehicles (NMV), and 
promotes walkability and NMV traffic over motorized traffic, a need that cannot be ignored for a 
safe and equitable commute. 
Recognizing the importance of universal accessibility and rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 
2016, need was felt to prepare a separate document on this subject. Accordingly, the task was 
assigned to the Urban Roads and Streets (H-8) Committee to prepare “Manual on Universal 
Accessibility for Urban Roads and Streets”. The H-8 Committee in its meeting held on 11.02.2017 
entrusted the work of preparation of initial draft to the sub-group under the chairmanship of 
Ms. Anjlee Agarwal comprising Ms. Nidhi Madan and Shri Debabrata Chakravarti. The initial 
draft was discussed in numerous meetings and valuable inputs were received from members of 
H-8 Committee in addition from Shri Ashok Bhattacharjee, Shri Amit Bhatt, Ms. Sonal Shah and 
Shri Snehil Sinha. The H-8 Committee approved the document in its meeting held on 18.08.2017 
for placing before the HSS Committee. 
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

1.1	
Background
Roads occupy 15-20 per cent of the total land area in a typical city (ITDP and EPC, 2011). 
They are an important and ubiquitous form of public space and core component of any city’s 
transportation framework. The location, design and continuity of the road network determines 
how effectively people, goods, and materials move through the city.
A comprehensive design approach, implementation, monitoring and consistent communication 
on universal accessibility in the street, road and pedestrian environment and access to and use 
of public transport infrastructure are essential for all users.
Improved accessibility allows for greater use of Non-Motorized Vehicles (NMV), and promotes 
walkability and NMV traffic over motorized traffic, a need that cannot be ignored for a safe and 
equitable commute.
The guiding principle of ‘universal accessibility’ is to create obstacle-free environment. 
It encompasses broad-spectrum ideas to create accessible streets, buildings and 
environment to the maximum extent possible. Accessibility here refers not only to persons 
with disabilities but to all possible users. It emphasizes inclusive environment in public spaces 
and infrastructure, accommodates the mobility needs of ‘all individuals’.
T able 1.1 shows a wide range of persons who may or may not have “disability”, however, require 
accessible design elements.

1.2	
Comprehensive Approach to Universal Accessibility
Every day a vast majority of the population encounters barriers in public spaces and in public 
transport. Many travelers, particularly persons with reduced mobility and persons with disabilities 
often depend on personalized vehicle for their daily trips, due to the barriers they encounter 
in public spaces and public transport. Persons with reduced mobility include senior citizens; 
families with young children; unescorted children; persons with temporary ailments, medical 
conditions and hidden diseases; pregnant women; persons carrying heavy luggage; those with 
communication problems, etc.
To comprehensively address universal access and suggest application of its principles and 
standards to promote walkability, non-motorized vehicle and public transport usage, three critical 
parts of a journey have been identified-
1.	
Point of Origin or Destination  (home/healthcare facility/educational institution/
entertainment venue)
2.	
Connecting Route to T ransit T erminal (street and footpath infrastructure/NMV 
infrastructure used for the commute)
3.	
Accessibility of the T ransit T erminal (to facilitate transportation through public 
transportation such as Bus Stops, BRT, Metro, Monorail, Railway Stations, Feeder 
and Paratransit Stops). 
These together make up the critical elements of a complete trip chain for a seamless journey. 
A complete trip chain starts from the point of origin to the walk/commute, cycle and/or wait for 
transport, boarding, travel and alighting followed by the walk/commute to the final destination (Fig. 
1.1). Each trip chain must ensure ‘safety for all’ including persons with and without disabilities.
Any break in the trip chain results in lack of access and independent mobility. Inaccessible links 
require taking an indirect route, increasing travel times, fatigue, uncertainty and potential modal 
conflicts. The goal must be for people to have access to all vehicles and the full-service area, as 
well as the pedestrian environment (WHO, 2011). The complete trip chain must be universally 
accessible with a mandatory training, implementation, and maintenance and monitoring to 
ensure that it remains so in perpetuity. 
Universally accessible design will help increase the number of people walking and the number 
of people using public transportation. For this, pedestrian environment and all transit systems – 
buses, bus shelters, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), metro, rail terminuses and stations, etc. should 
be accessible.

By improving the accessibility of the entire travel journey, local and regional authorities can enable 
persons with reduced mobility to adopt a less car-dependent lifestyle and use sustainable modes 
(walking, cycling, and public transport) instead. Furthermore, local and regional authorities can 
also achieve fuel and energy savings and promote independent mobility, which will increase the 
quality of life and the attractiveness of the city or region for inhabitants and visitors.
Universally accessible infrastructure benefits everyone irrespective of age, gender and disability. 
Thus, improving the accessibility of door-to-door mobility-chains.
1.3	
Need for Manual
There is need to fill the knowledge gap on universal access and provide guidance to practitioners, 
city officials and authorities to plan, design pedestrian environment and sustainable transportation 
on urban roads and streets. The objectives of this manual are:
•	
To suggest application of universal access principles and standards to promote 
walkability, non-motorized vehicle and public transport usage; 
•	
To highlight physical and environmental barriers in the public realm and recommend 
universal accessibility standards; and
•	
To highlight benefits of universal accessibility and sustainable transportation, and to 
promote sensitivity and innovation in design.
By doing so we:
•	
Ensure safe and independent commute between place of origin and destination, 
including first and last mile connectivity;
•	
Provide convenient, quick access and exit and usage of all areas;
•	
Implement inclusive design and achieve social inclusion; and
•	
Increase energy-efficiency in transport by improving the trip chain of all citizens 
(including persons with reduced mobility and persons with disabilities).

Who benefits: Everyone (Photos 1.1 and 1.2), including
•	
Persons with reduced mobility such as senior citizens; families with young children; 
unescorted children; persons with temporary ailments, medical conditio ns and 
hidden diseases; pregnant women; persons carrying heavy luggage and people 
with communication problems (including different linguistic and ethnic groups like 
migrants, tourists etc.). They are commonly referred to as transport disadvantage 
group.
•	
Persons with diverse disabilities
Other Advantages
There are a number of social, moral, legal and commercial advantages of improving 
accessibility on urban roads and streets and public transport infrastructure. These are:
•	
Social advantages: Improves accessibility for pedestrians (including 
wheelchair users), cyclists/tri-cyclists, etc. Improved public transport access 
to daily activities contributes directly to increased quality of life. This promotes 
independence of persons with reduced mobility and persons with disabilities. 
It enables everyone to use sustainable transport modes, contribute to reduced 
pollution and save energy. It ensures that day-to-day services are also accessible 
for non-motorists.
•	
Moral advantages: Improved service quality (for pedestrians, cyclists, and public 
transport users) and facilities adapted to everyone’s needs makes inclusion 
happen. Increased independence, better visibility and enhanced opportunities to 
education, employment, health facilities, recreational and social activities will help 
mainstream vulnerable groups.
•	
Legal advantages: Incorporation of universal accessibility standards will ensure 
compliance with various laws and byelaws of the country, which is mandatory.
•	
Commercial advantages: Investing in accessibility is a cost-effective way 
of contributing to a sustainable economy and tackling the future challenges of 
demographic, economic and environmental changes. Integrated accessible 
design exhibits demonstrable cost savings by avoiding the necessity of costly 
subsequent amendments and reconstructions. Universal accessible environment 
attracts untapped users resulting in more passenger inflow and more revenue.

Application of the Manual
IRC:103–2012 “Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities” have highlighted design standards for 
pedestrian facilities and specifically mentions that “Accessible design is the foundation and 
primary concern for all pedestrian design, hence all pedestrian facilities need to be planned, 
designed, operated and maintained so that it is usable by everyone, including those with 
disabilities or using mobility aids”.
Aspects covered in IRC:103-2012 “Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities” are:
•	
Inclusive street infrastructure
•	
Inclusive grade separators
•	
Continuity and consistency
•	
Level change
•	
Maintenance
•	
Pedestrian crossings
•	
Pedestrian facilities-parking
•	
Pedestrian facilities at transit areas
•	
Bollards
•	
Lighting
•	
Ramps/stairs
•	
Elevators/lifts
•	
Washrooms/toilets
•	
School zone improvement
IRC:103-2012 sets the tone for need for universal accessibility. Provision of comprehensive 
planning and design principles and detailed technical specifications on mindset of “people first” 
approach including promotion of NMV vehicles over Motorized one linked with gender safety 
and of otherwise able people should be more detailed. This Manual makes it mandatory for the 
executing agencies, urban local bodies and concerned stake holders to plan, design, implement 
and maintain environment and infrastructure. It also provides practical guidance towards 
evaluating and improving accessibility through a comprehensive approach in all geographical 
areas of India including hills, plains and deserts. The standards and design guidelines shall be 
applied with some modifications, if required, in all weather conditions.
1.4.1	
Structure
This Manual introduces the concept of accessibility and its importance in the Indian context. 
It focuses on the evaluation of accessibility in existing street and road infrastructure and the 
relevant planning and designing principles to improve the same.
The first few chapters introduce concepts of universal accessibility, best practices and highlights 
the multidisciplinary approach required for Universal Accessibility. The following chapters 
provide technical design standards of Street and Road Infrastructure, and Access to Public 
Transportation.

Laws and Legislations in India and Around the World
The Government of India enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and signed and 
ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. To realize 
all the rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and the UNCRPD, stakeholders 
need to understand and implement universal accessibility in its holistic sense.
The Government of India aim to create world-class and smart cities and transport systems in the 
country cannot be truly realized, unless these are inclusive. This will require many interventions 
at macro and micro level to address the needs of all users. Therefore, it is essential to understand 
universal accessibility as “utilization of all the facilities to the fullest by ALL people” i.e. use is 
more important and not restricted only to reach. 
1.5.1	
Rights of persons with disabilities act, 2016
The Government of India enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 20161. 
Responsibility has been cast upon the appropriate governments to take effective measures 
to ensure that the persons with disabilities enjoy their rights equally with others. Following 
definitions are laid down in the Act and are relevant for the users of this Manual.
“public building” means a government or private building, used or accessed by the public at 
large, including a building used for educational or vocational purposes, workplace, commercial 
activities, public utilities, religious, cultural, leisure or recreational activities, medical or health 
services, law enforcement agencies, reformatories or judicial, transport terminuses and hubs for 
example, railway stations or platforms, roadways, bus stands or terminus, airports or waterways;
“transportation systems” includes road transport, rail transport, air transport, water transport, 
para transit systems for the last mile connectivity, road and street infrastructure, etc.;
“universal design” means the design of products, environments, programs and services to be 
usable by all people to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized 
design and shall apply to assistive devices including advanced technologies for particular group 
of persons with disabilities.

Chapter VIII, Section 41. (1) clearly mentions “The appropriate Government shall take suitable 
measures to provide, (c) accessible roads to address mobility necessary for persons with 
disabilities. Time limit for making existing infrastructure and premises accessible and action for 
that purpose within a period not exceeding five years from the date of notification of such rules.
1.5.2	
UN convention on rights of persons with disabilities, 2008
Article 9 Accessibility of UNCRPD clearly states:
The countries will eliminate barriers that persons with disabilities face in buildings, the outdoors, 
transport, information, communication and services, in both cities and the countryside. They will 
make rules and put them into practice for buildings, roads, transportation, indoor and outdoor 
objects; information, communications, and other things, for example, electronic services and 
emergency services.
Hence, the CRPD implementation process in India requires a clear, unequivocal link between 
universal design and accessibility in the built environment, in information and communication, 
and for transportation standards.
1.5.3	
Sustainable development goals
Target 11.2 under Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): mandates to provide access, by 2030, 
to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, 
notably by expanding public transport with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable 
situations such as women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.
1.5.4	
Motor vehicle (Amendment) bill, 2017
Government policy aimed at promoting universal accessibility and sustainable urban roads and 
streets for all in India.
1.6	
Best Practices
Various cities around the world have planned and designed their pedestrian environment, 
vehicles and public transit systems to ensure inclusive designs and barrier free elements. These 
planning and design principles have been adapted differently. 
Although some European cities have exemplary accessibility networks, it is important to 
emphasize that these may be adapted for the Indian context, but they cannot be replicated as it 
is. For example, European cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam have provided very good cycling 
and pedestrian connectivity and integration to its public transport systems, yet these cities do not 
have to deal with intermediate public transport like cycle rickshaws, auto- rickshaws, etc. (TRIPP 
for IUT & MoUD, 2013).
In Japan, the pedestrian and transport infrastructure is designed with universal accessibility 
principles (Photo 1.3). Accessible street design features from Colombo, Sri Lanka, Geneva, 
London and Canada are also highlighted in this section. Also, illustrated are Mass Rapid Transit 
Systems from some Indian cities, which include universal design features, connected pedestrian 
pathways and provisions of NMV lanes (Photo 1.4).

Projected Benefits
Physical connectivity
Visual and physical continuity of footpaths makes navigation and orientation easier and saves 
time and energy. Choices in the accessible environment with coherent, direct, safe, and 
comfortable features attract pedestrians, cyclists and tri-cycle users. By providing a safe walking 
environment, the footpath will also provide opportunities for a healthy environment. Public 
transport within reach, integration with other modes and availability of accessible feeder modes 
too, is an important link in the travel journey/trip chain.

Social inclusion
A safe walking environment particularly for women, children and persons with disabilities 
promotes social interaction in different public spaces that the walkways connect. Well 
designed and maintained pedestrian infrastructure benefit persons with diverse disabilities, 
including users of wheelchairs and tricycles, elderly, temporary ailments, carrying packages/
luggage, hawkers etc. by providing a safe alternative to sharing the roadway with fast-
moving traffic. Access and use of public transport allows all commuters the opportunity 
to explore more and experience better, the environment that surrounds them. It promotes 
enhanced opportunities to livelihood and employment, access to health, education and 
leisure for all.

Chapter 2 
Multidisciplinary Process
An inclusive transport framework should have the following goals:
•	
Enhance safety for pedestrians and users of all modes of transport.
•	
Create a meaningful network of Non-Motorized Vehicles (NMV) lanes and NMV 
priority streets to provide connectivity within and across neighborhoods in the city.
•	
Increase public transport and NMV usage through the provision of dedicated Right-of-
Way (ROW).
•	
Improve network of public transport in the city such that it is accessible within a 
5-minute walking distance.
•	
Ensure that the entire street network is universally accessible.
2.1	
Challenges Related to Implementation
Knowledge gap: Professionals, practitioners and other people such as draftsmen, contractors 
and masons do not have first-hand information on universal accessibility elements. This can 
result in faulty designs and/or expensive retrofitting and creation of unsafe and inaccessible 
environment. 
Lack of awareness:  At present, the civic agencies, road owning agencies and public transport 
providers including private contractors lack understanding and technical knowhow of inclusive 
design. The fundamentals and basic principles are often overlooked or incorporated in a 
piecemeal manner resulting in creation of islands of accessibility. 
Enforcement: DPRs and contract documents must include specific provisions to ensure that 
universal accessibility is integrated into the road project. 
2.2	
Recommended Approach
2.2.1	
Stakeholder consultation
There needs to be a strong emphasis on the continuous involvement of all relevant stakeholder-
groups (all persons including those with reduced mobility and disabilities, city-consultants, local/
regional authorities, etc.) from the very start of the project. Towards this goal, a two-pronged 
approach is proposed. 
(a)	
Establish a system of effective stakeholder involvement and awareness raising: 
Create platforms for educating, sharing ideas and information and learning from 
each-other’s experiences with the stakeholders, in all the phases of creating and 
maintaining inclusive transport systems. The stakeholders will include users, planners, 
architects, engineers, contractors, civic agencies, and government departments that 
construct and maintain public facilities and outdoor environment. Raise awareness 
among the local and regional decision-makers of the link between accessibility and 
energy-efficiency in transport, by initiating communication among all relevant local 
and regional stakeholders to improve accessibility. 
(b)	
Establish a structure of systematic and effective approach for comprehensive 
design including universal accessibility in planning, implementation, and 



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:117-2018
22
evaluation: Piecemeal implementation will not be effective until the intermediate 
links are established. For example, the efficacy of an accessible BRT or Metro system 
will be incomplete, if people cannot access the footpaths, roads and intermediate 
pedestrian infrastructure to reach these facilities. A seamless trip chain is necessary 
to close the loop. 
(c)	
Capacity Building and Trainings: Transport networks keep changing and evolving 
based on user requirements, climatic conditions and infrastructure depreciation in 
real time. Regular monitoring of all systems and services within this framework is 
imperative to maximize its efficacy. Any shortfall in implementation and maintenance 
and/or lack of understanding on the part of implementing agencies, civic bodies, user 
groups and other service providers will compromise the accessibility of this network. 
It is heartening that there is now enhanced commitment to invest time, funds and 
technology in capacity building, maintenance, monitoring and operational activities.
A strategic planning effort involving all relevant stakeholders (persons with reduced mobility, 
persons with disabilities, government departments, consultants including planners, architects, 
engineers, implementing and maintaining agencies including contractors and vendors) is 
needed. It provides local stakeholders with the understanding of the attitudinal, social and 
physical challenges that confront persons with disabilities of different ages and gender, and, 
need for creating seamless travel chains. Conducted by a team of qualified access auditors, 
design professionals (architect, transport planner and urban planner), persons with diverse 
disabilities and senior citizens, it provides information for effective implementation of the audit 
recommendations. Capacity Building and training of professionals and practitioners would help 
ensure implementation of universal accessibility standards. This will result in:
	
•	
Improving credibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of the work;
	
•	
Fulfilling the needs of ageing society;
	
•	
Facilitating the integration of immigrants by improving accessibility and
	
•	
Avoiding costly corrections by taking into account the accessibility requirements 
right from the start (Photo 2.1).

and arrangements made to expose all concerned to the requirements of universal accessibility 
for urban roads and streets.

2.2.2	
Design and planning
Design Review
Prior to implementation, design review may be undertaken to verify the viability of accessible 
elements/routes proposed, to minimize any potential hazards or constraints in the trip chain. 
To achieve the consistency of accessibility along the trip chain, it is therefore important to identify 
contextual barriers, alternate routes for pedestrian and NMVs that may be different from vehicular 
road network, particularly for arterial roads, and design to existing conditions. 
As per the findings of the Walkability survey conducted by CAI Asia in six Indian cities, consistent 
low ratings were observed for the parameters- amenities and ‘disability infrastructure’. The 
surveys highlight only one element of accessibility i.e. need for kerb ramp for footpaths, and 
does not cover other essential elements such as height and width of footpath, unobstructed 
walking zone, surface, continuity of tactile pavers and color/visual contrast. Absence of a kerb 
ramp does not only hamper mobility of those using mobility aids like wheelchairs and walkers, 
but also deters other pedestrians such as baby pram users, families with young children, 
persons carrying heavy luggage and persons with reduced mobility. Some of the essential 
elements are:
•	
Pre-journey planning information including signage/maps/accessible route information; 
•	
Adequate space requirements including clearances, widths, heights, rest spaces;
•	
Level differences – steps, ramps, kerbs, elevators;
•	
Clarity of route- wayfinding tools including tactile pavers (Photo 2.2)., color contrast, 
materials and adequate illumination
•	
Road crossings, traffic signaling, safety features; and
•	
Equitable access to transit terminus, toilets, information kiosks and other facilities.

2.2.3	
Construction and monitoring process
Designing and planning of inclusive road and street framework is insufficient, without stringent 
implementation and monitoring. Regular monitoring of all systems and services within this 
framework is imperative to maximize its efficacy. Any shortfall in implementation and maintenance 
on the part of implementing agencies, civic bodies, user groups and other service providers will 
compromise the accessibility of this network.

2.2.4	
Accessibility audits
Access Audits are an important means of ensuring universal accessibility and must cover all stage 
of the process of planning, design, construction, maintenance, monitoring and evaluation. Audits 
identify deficiencies in road/street infrastructure and developing strategies to overcome them in 
the most effective, practical and aesthetic way at an early stage. Audits are valuable from the 
perspective of identifying deficiencies in road/street infrastructure and developing strategies to 
overcome them in the most effective, practical and aesthetic way. As a result of audits, physical 
and informational barriers are identified, removed and implementation is possible (Photo 2.3).
Photo 2.3 Access Audit Implementaion, Mumbai
2.2.5	
Walkability audit
It is a strategic planning effort that involves all relevant stakeholders (persons with reduced 
mobility, persons with disabilities, government agencies, consultants including planners, 
architects, engineers, implementing and maintaining agencies including contractors and 
vendors). It provides local stakeholders with the understanding of the attitudinal, social and 
physical challenges that confront persons with disabilities of different ages and gender, and, 
need for creating seamless travel chains. Conducted by a team of qualified access auditors, 
design professionals (architect, transport planner and urban planner), persons with diverse 
disabilities and senior citizens, it provides information for effective implementation of the audit 
recommendations. An audit checklist is provided in the Appendix 1.
2.2.6	
Operations and maintenance
Further, post- implementation, continued maintenance is vital to maximize the benefit of the 
access measures taken. The absence of clear, unobstructed paths, temporary barriers or 
utilities added later on, can easily compromise the entirety of accessible trip chain. Therefore, it 
is important that all agencies involved remain alert to changes, modifications required and the 
access required prior to any intervention. Access audits on a periodic basis would be of help as 
post occupancy surveys or access audits also provide further insights into site specific concerns 
or usability that were unforeseen. Regular oversight will avoid exacerbating these issues and 
resolve them in a timely way. 
Regular maintenance of the infrastructure is essential for safety, accessibility and reliability. 
Infrastructure once in place and not maintained (Photo 2.4) will have both health and cost 
implications. Funding for maintenance should be incorporated from the start and the timeline for 
refurbishment should be clearly defined.

Chapter 3 
Street and Road Elements
3.1	
Essential Design Considerations
The road infrastructure should provide safe and secure, convenient, and fast connectivity for 
NMV users. The essential principles are as follows:
•	
Provision of segregated track or path for most part of the journey.
•	
Speed reduction by design on roads where NMVs mix with motorized vehicles.
•	
Reduction of speeds of motorized vehicles at pedestrian crossings and intersections.
•	
Combining shortest and safest routes.
•	
Improve visibility for both NMV and motorized modes, especially at intersections.
3.2	
T echnical Design Standards
3.2.1	
Footpath
Footpath should be regarded as part of road infrastructure. It should be connected and continuous. 
Footpaths should be provided consistently between all major origin/destinations, trip generator 
activities, and other locations where people walk. 
A footpath should:
•	
Have height of a standard public step riser i.e. 150 mm maximum;
•	
Be at least 2 m wide, where there are trees on the footpath spacing of 1 m should be 
maintained (Fig. 3.1 );
•

Design standards for footpath are given (IRC:103-2012) with footpath widths along different 
land-use areas and hierarchy of roads. Footpath width along residential areas and arterial roads 
should be of minimum 1.8 m, whereas for commercial areas along arterial roads it should be of 
minimum 2.5 m (T able 3.1). It also highlights the surfaces and lighting levels required (T able 3.2).

3.2.2	
Kerb ramps
Kerb ramps are a mandatory design element to access footpaths. Absence of kerb ramp prevents 
wheelchair users, pram users and users of other assistive devices to utilize footpaths. When 
designing kerb ramps, it is important to ensure that:
•	
Kerb should be dropped, to be flush with walk way, at a gradient no greater than 1:10 
on both sides of necessary and convenient crossing points (Fig. 3.7 ).
•	
Floor tactile paving- Guiding & Warning paver shall be provided to guide persons with 
visual impairment so that a person with visual impairment does not accidentally walk 
onto the road (Fig. 3.8  and Photo 3.1);
•	
Finishes shall have non-slip surface with a texture traversable by a wheel chair;
•	
If there is a kerb ramp on one side of the roadway, there is also one on the other to	
prevent pedestrians being ‘stranded’ on the roadway itself; 
•	
There are no low points in the gutter where water can collect; and 
•	
If installed at a pedestrian crossing point, the whole kerb ramp is contained within the 
crossing markings.

Photo 3.1 Kerb Ramps with T actile Warning Pavers at T ransition Points
Cross falls
Cross falls should only be provided where absolutely necessary for drainage purposes and can 
range from 1:50 to 1:100. If the change in cross fall is so severe that one wheel of a wheelchair

or one foot of a walker leaves the ground, it may cause the user of the wheelchair or walker to 
fall. Steeper gradients tend to misdirect buggies and wheelchairs. Where falls are not adequate, 
silt will accumulate after rain and cause the surface to become slippery. Puddles also cause 
the footpath to become slippery, lead to glare in bright sunshine after other parts of the footpath 
have become dry and become a hazard in frosty weather. Any break in the surface, e.g. drainage 
channels/gratings or the gaps between boards on a walkway, should not be more than 12 mm 
and should cross perpendicular to the direction of movement (Refer Section 3.2.13). This will 
prevent walking sticks and wheels getting caught in the gaps.
3.2.3	
Ramps (slope ramps)
•	
Ramps gradient should ideally be 1 in 15 and no greater than 1 in 12;
•	
Width of the ramp should not be less than 1200 mm and preferred width is 1800 mm min.;
•	
Surface materials should be slip-resistant, non-reflective, firmly-fixed and easily 
maintained;
•	
The edge of the ramp should have an edge protection with a minimum height of 100 mm;
•	
Landings every 750 mm of vertical rise and should be provided at regular intervals as 
indicated in T able 3.3.
•	
On long ramps, a horizontal resting space should be provided every 9 meters;
•	
A tapping or lower rail should be positioned so that its bottom edge is no higher than 
200 mm above ground level;
•	
Handrails on the ramps should be on both sides at two levels: upper at 900 mm and 
lower at 760 mm; both end to be rounded and grouted; extend 300 mm beyond top 
and bottom of ramp (Fig. 3.8 ); and
•	
A row of tactile warning paver should be placed 300 mm beginning and end of each run

Lift locations should be clearly signposted from the main pedestrian route and 
recognizable through design and location;
•	
The colour and tone of the lift doors should contrast with the surrounding wall finish 
to assist in their location (Fig. 3.9). Lift doors with metallic finishes such as steel grey 
and silver should be avoided as they are difficult to identify by persons with low vision;
•	
The lift lobby shall be of an inside measurement of 1800 mm X 2000 mm or more. A 
clear landing area in front of the lift doors of minimum dimensions 1500 mm x 1500 
mm should be provided (Fig. 3.10 );
•	
Changes in floor finish must be flushed. There should be no level difference between 
lift door and the floor surface at each level; the gap if unavoidable should not be more 
than 10 mm; and

Announcement system should be of 50 decibels; and
•	
The display could be digital or segmented LED, or an appropriate alternative. A yellow 
or light green on black display is preferred to a red on black display, as it is easier to 
read.
3.2.5	
Platform/stair lift
In grade separators such as foot over bridges, elevated stations, etc., where there is no space 
to provide access by a ramp and to accommodate a regular elevator; platform or stair lift can be 
provided. This is feasible only where the payload and the travel distance is not too much.
•	
No lift well/shaft required, available with both manual and mechanical system (Photo 
3.2).

Handrails
•	
Handrails should be circular in section with a diameter of 38-45 mm and formed from 
materials, which provide good grip such as timber, nylon or powder coating, or matt 
finish metal finishes;
•	
The handrail should contrast in colour (preferably yellow/orange) with surrounding 
surfaces (Photo 3.6);
•	
These should be at least 50 mm clear of the surface to which they are attached and 
should be supported on brackets, which do not obstruct continuous hand contact with 
the handrail (Fig. 3.14 );
•	
The handrail should be positioned at two levels - 760 mm and 900 mm above the 
pitch-line of a flight of stairs (Fig. 3.15 ); and
•	
Handrail at foot of the flight of stairs should extend 300 mm beyond the stairs in 
the line of travel and returning to the wall or floor or rounded off, with a positive end 
that does not project into the route of travel. Rounded handrails ends reduce risk of 
catching clothes or injury from the exposed handrail end (Photo 3.4).

Tactile pavers- guiding and warning
Usually persons with vision impairment need guidance in using a pedestrianized area, especially 
if the footpath crosses larger open spaces where the usual guidance given by the edge of the 
footpath or building base is not available, or when pedestrian need guidance around obstacles. 
These are readily available in the domestic Indian market. For external areas, such as roads and 
streets, vitrified pavers are preferred to ceramic/cement.
It is important that, whichever tactile pavers are used i.e. guiding or warning, they should be 
used consistently to avoid confusion. The different texture can be followed by people using a 
long or white cane, and can also be detected tactually through the soles of their shoes, with a 
cane and any remaining residual vision that they may have.
Guiding Pavers
These pavers/blocks/tiles have straight continuous line (Fig. 3.17) and indicate the correct path/
route to follow, leading to building entrances, an amenity, bus stop etc. It should be laid in a 
simple and logical manner and not be located close to manholes or drains, to avoid confusion for 
persons with vision impairments. A continuous path of guiding pavers in the direction of pedestrian 
travel, which has a different texture to the rest of the footpath, can provide this guidance.
Guiding Pavers
These are 300 x 300 mm pavers that incorporate flat topped 
bars that are 5 mm (± 0.5 mm) high, 25 mm wide and spaced 
50 mm from the centre of one bar to the centre of the next. They 
are used externally to guide persons with visual impairments 
along the circulation path (Fig. 3.14). These shall be used 
internally in large busy areas and transport terminals.

Warning Pavers
Warning pavers/blocks/tiles provides warning signal to screen off obstacles, drop-offs or other 
hazards, to discourage movement in an incorrect direction and to give warning of a corner or 
junction (Fig. 3.18). It should be placed 300 mm at the beginning and end of the ramps, stairs 
and entrance to any door. It should be laid across the entire footpath where the crossing occurs 
and be 600 mm wide so that someone can’t miss it by stepping over it. Provide warning paver 
strip along the inner edge of a footpath where there is a break in the line of the corridor, e.g. at 
a garage forecourt or a gap in a building façade for an archway. Tactile paving at intersections, 
turnings, building entrances, etc. should be provided.
Warning Pavers
These are 300 mm x 300 mm pavers that incorporate rows of 5 
mm (± 0.5 mm) high flat-topped blister like domes. These indicate 
a potential hazard or change in direction installed within or on 
a ground surface in both the internal and external environment. 
These blocks are placed to warn persons with visual impairments 
of the approaching danger. Warning blocks are used along the 
approach path to unavoidable obstacles and hazards.

Fig. 3.20 Layout of T
actile Pavers at T urnings
The layout and colour of tactile paving used to assist the visually impaired in navigating the 
pedestrian environment should ensure that a consistent logic is applied. This includes the 
cumulative impact of tactile pavers with other material choices. For example, the use of strong 
red or yellow tactile paving may not be appropriate to avoid visual clutter associated with too 
many surface types or colours. In such instances, the use of a more varied palette or contrasting 
tones is preferable. Pavers should have a colour which contrasts with the surrounding surface. 
Tactile paving must be maintained to ensure that the profile does not erode away. This will allow 
persons with visual impairments to recognize that they are continuing in the right direction and 
that they have not reached a junction or missed a turning (Photo 3.5). Distance of 600 mm to 
be maintained from the edge of footpath/boundary wall and any obstruction to navigate persons 
with visual impairments.

Pedestrian crossings
Many cities have erected barriers to prevent pedestrians from crossing the streets. Pedestrians 
are forced to use over bridges or subways. However, due to the difficulty and risks associated 
with the use of over bridges and subways, pedestrians continue to cross at ground level. In that 
case, pedestrians cross at random locations and do not benefit from the safety that crossing in 
groups at planned at-grade crossings can provide.
Measures that discourage walking induce more motorized trips, exacerbating traffic congestion. 
This tempts policymakers to build more high-speed roads that disrupt pedestrian movement even 
more. Properly designed pedestrian facilities can help break this vicious cycle and Guidelines 
for Pedestrian Facilities, IRC:103-2012 have provided standards for the same. Well-designed

pedestrian crossings allow pedestrians to cross busy streets safely and conveniently. When 
paired with traffic calming elements such as speed tables, they can improve safety and create a 
seamless connection between the two sides of a street. Photo 3.6 shows tabletops marked by 
tactile pavers for persons with visual impairments. Figs. 3.23 to 3.27 provides situations/options

Central medians and refuge
•	
Pedestrian refuge is required for safe and barrier free road crossing, as many persons 
with reduced mobility cannot cross the road in one stretch as they feel exhausted;
•	
Uniformity in crossing distance should be maintained;
•	
It is essential to have pedestrian refuge (islands) in crossings with following standards:
	
o	
Cut through and level with the street (Fig. 3.27 - Fig. 3.29 ); or
	
o	
Have kerb ramps on both the sides and have a level area of not less than 1500 
mm long in the middle; and
	
o	
A coloured tactile marking strip of warning pavers at least 600 mm wide should 
mark the beginning and end of a median/pedestrian refuge to guide pedestrian 
with visual impairments to its location.

Fig. 3.29 Median Ramp and Zebra Crossing for Persons with Disabilities
A good median reduces conflict between opposite directions of traffic and acts as pedestrian 
refuge but has frequent enough breaks to discourage motor vehicle users from driving in the 
wrong direction. Medians can help streamline traffic and ensure safety on higher-speed streets 
where there is a risk of collisions involving right-turning traffic. In addition, they prevent speeding 
drivers from crossing into the opposing traffic lane. Medians improve safety for pedestrians by 
functioning as refuge islands, which allow pedestrians to cross one direction of travel at a time. It 
is much easier to find an adequate gap in half the traffic flow rather than all of it. Central medians 
can accommodate other elements such as landscaping, pedestrian and cycling boulevards, and 
parking.
Medians that extend too far without any opportunities to cross, turn right, or make a U-turn 
make the other side inaccessible and unnecessarily increase the total distance travelled. They 
encourage vehicle movement on the wrong side, thereby compromising safety. Hence, the 
provision of breaks in a median at appropriate intervals is critical. Sometimes, guardrails or high 
kerbs are built to prevent pedestrians from crossing the street. However, they are surmounted 
anyway. If a median is not wide enough, pedestrians may spill over into the carriageway while 
waiting for traffic to clear.
3.2.11	
Resting spaces
Elderly and pedestrians with disabilities can rest at reasonably frequent intervals. Provision of 
resting places - simple sitting areas with chairs, benches or steps where one can have a break - 
is an important element of pedestrian spaces. Resting spaces and shelter should also be there 
where frequency is more.

•	
As with all street furniture, seating should be placed next to the footpath without 
obstructing it, and painted in contrasting colors. Seats can be as simple as wooden 
benches or perch-type rails to lean against. 
•	
Seats should be 450 mm and backrest 700 mm high.
•	
Tables with knee clearance of 700 mm and 600 mm deep should be provided with 
clear width of table 600 mm and wheelchair space of 1000 mm.
•	
Along frequently used pedestrian ways, seating should be provided at regular intervals, 
typically every 50 metres.
•	
In commonly used pedestrian areas, such as the one access audited, resting places 
should be provided at intervals not greater than 100 m at strategic points. 
•	
It is helpful to people with sight problems if these and other amenity areas adjacent to 
information signages, walkways and pedestrian routes and have contrasting colours 
for persons with sight problems and visual impairments (Photo 3.7 and Fig. 3.30 ).

Materials and finishes
Importance of Material Selection
Appropriate selection of materials in design impacts the aesthetics, usability and comfort of the 
street for all its users – and in the long run has a huge impact towards endearing these places 
to the citizens. 
Materials selected should have minimal impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions, 
embodied energy, life-cycle costs, quarrying, transporting and top-soil preservation. Materials 
selected should enhance
•	
universal accessibility, 
•	
comfort and mobility for pedestrians, and 
•	
least efforts for people using non-motorised vehicles and bi-cycles
Material Selection Guidelines
•	
All paving materials, as a rule – should be finished as anti-skid, non-slip, unglazed 
material. 
•	
Locally available materials should be preferred. 
•	
Use of contrasting materials and textures to inform pedestrians of changes to the 
function of space (i.e. to demarcate verges, footway, strips, cycle paths and driveways) 
and in particular to guide the visually impaired.
•	
Materials selected should reduce storm water runoff and urban heat island effect, as 
much as possible. 
•	
Since most road projects are redevelopment projects – Reuse/recycling existing road 
construction materials is preferable and advisable. 
•	
Materials which have some recycled content or that can be recycled after use should 
be preferred e.g.: 
	
o	
Recycled Asphalt 
	
o	
Recycle Rubber 
•	
Recycled stone or other existing construction materials. Long life, durability and ease 
of repair of materials must be factored in during material selection and project cost 
calculations.
•	
Use and depletion of finite raw materials should be reduced - by replacing them with 
rapidly renewable materials. (Rapidly renewable materials are ones that are typically 
harvested within a 10-year cycle, e.g., bamboo products, corn products, wheat based 
products, strawboards etc.).
•	
Materials with low cement content and low embodied energy should be given 
preference.
While providing pedestrian facilities such as ramps, kerb ramps, footpaths etc., it is important to 
consider different finishes to safe guard people from falling, slipping/tripping. T able 3.4 provides 
common do’s and don’ts in pedestrian areas.

3.2.13	
Cycle tracks and non-motorized transport (NMT)
Non-Motorized Vehicles (NMV) includes cycles, tri-cycles, cycle rickshaws, pushcarts, and any 
other form of mobility that is powered by humans. NMV play an important role in provision of 
transport services.
Modal share in medium and large cities show that 13-21% of people cycle. It is the most affordable 
mode of transport for groups of all ages and low-income groups covering diverse accessibility 
needs.
In India, usually persons with disabilities from low economic groups use tri-cycle for employment/
livelihood and/or essential activities such as education, health and socialization purposes. As 
per Census 2011 report on Madhya Pradesh Mode of Transportation, tricycle used by persons 
with disabilities was also considered as bicycle. Tri-cycle users at times commute long distances 
ranging from 10 to 20 km (Samarthyam, 2012). This mode provides access to opportunities and 
is the most affordable means of transport for the disabled. 
3.2.14	
NMV infrastructure
Citywide NMV networks should be created by combining segregated cycle tracks, and traffic-
calmed areas. Traffic calming is required on local roads to ensure that motorized vehicles speed 
remains below 30 km/h and cyclists are safe without segregated tracks.
The most effective option would be to segregate users into separate tracks or paths (Fig.  3.31) 
along the road network, especially for arterial and sub-arterials; and increase signals timing for 
them. On other streets, there is a need to reduce their speed difference by traffic calming without 
affecting directness or coherence (TRIPP, IIT Delhi, 2014).
Fig. 3.31 Segregate Users into Separate T
racks or Paths
Security from harassment on the streets also becomes an important consideration for NMV 
users especially for women and children. Planning and design elements that introduce eyes on 
the streets – by removing setbacks and compound walls, having active building fronts and mixed 
land use, and street vendors – should be a part of the spatial planning to ensure security.



======================================================================

In addition, NMV infrastructure should meet the following criteria:
•	
Provision of infrastructure suitable to road typology, which is coherent, direct, safe, 
comfortable and attractive.
•	
Parking spaces for NMV public modes.
•	
Signage placed at strategic locations for identification of NMV lanes (Photos 3.8 and 
3.9)

3.2.15	
NMV lane design considerations
•	
Provide adequate space such as slow-speed shared spaces, footpaths, cycle tracks, 
and greenways for NMV users; 
•	
Accommodating NMV involves two simple techniques: 
	
o	
Systematic traffic calming to ensure that smaller streets are safe places for the 
mixing of pedestrians and other modes “shared lanes”.
	
o	
Pedestrian and cycle infrastructure be physically separated from motor vehicle 
traffic (by raised kerbs, vehicle parking lanes, bollards, landscaping, etc.) on 
larger streets.
•	
Continuity to allow for reasonable speeds; 
•	
A smooth surface material—asphalt or concrete; 
•	
Paver blocks are to be avoided;
•	
Avoid high, uneven and unmarked speed breakers as these are hazardous;
•	
Manhole covers should be avoided and, if unavoidable, should be level with the 
surrounding surface;
•	
Continuous shade through tree cover;
•	
Elevation above the carriageway (e.g. +150 mm) that allows for storm water runoff; 



======================================================================

•	
At property access points, the cycle track remains at the same level and vehicle 
access is provided by a ramp in the buffer;
•	
Dedicated non-motorized transport infrastructure also includes walkways and cycle 
paths that utilize an independent Right-of-Way (ROW), such as in a park or along a 
transport corridor;
•	
Cycle stations (parking, sharing and hiring) should be arranged in close space network 
so that a station is always within walking distance from any point in the coverage 
area;
•	
Adopt building control regulations that encourage street frontage with many shop 
fronts, doors, windows and patios that open directly to pedestrian environments 
create a feeling of safety (eyes-on-street), while producing a more active and vibrant 
atmosphere. Discourage the construction of compound walls at the edge of public 
rights-of-way;
•	
Provide adequate street furniture for people to sit, rest and interact with each other. 
Street furniture also includes services-related infrastructure, such as dustbins, street 
vending, toilets, and signage. Street furniture can help make a street an attractive place 
to spend time. When positioned on narrow shared streets, benches, tables, street 
vending spaces, and other furniture can also function as traffic calming elements. 
Vending stands, tables, roofs, and water taps can support the formalization of street 
vending and promote better sanitary conditions; 
•	
Employ traffic calming elements (including speed humps, raised speed tables, 
bollards, roundabouts, and textured pavements) to ensure pedestrian and vehicle 
safety by reducing the top speed of motor vehicles. Traffic calming elements are 
particularly important in places where large numbers of children are present, such as 
schools, parks, and residential areas; and
•	
Provide street lighting of 35-40 lux level to ensure visibility by persons with low vision 
and safety on NMV facilities (CPWD & MoUD, 1998).
A 0.5 m buffer is needed between a cycle track and motor vehicle or parking lanes. The buffer 
can accommodate ramps and storm water catch pits. The buffer should be paved if it is adjacent 
to a parking lane. (Source: ITDP)

Median cycle tracks reduce conflicts with parking and property access. Frequent access points 
with ramps are essential. Turning movement conflicts at intersections can be mitigated through 
bicycle boxes and appropriate signal phasing.

In streets with service lanes, parking should be located on the left side so that passengers do not 
spill over on the cycle track when they exit a vehicle.

3.2.16	
Accessible parking
The following guidelines must be followed for design of accessible on-street 4-wheeler or tri-
cycle parking facilities.
•	
Designated accessible parking with overall minimum dimension of 3.6 m x 5.0 m must 
be provided, arranged perpendicular to the kerb and 3.5 m x 5.5 m must be provided 
for parallel parking.
•	
If provided perpendicular to the kerb, a minimum clear space of 1200 mm must be 
provided to facilitate transfer of wheelchair from the car to footpath. Appropriate kerb 
ramps must be provided to access footpaths from the parking slots. The gradient of a 
kerb ramp should not be steeper than 1:12; the flared sides should not be more than 
1:10.
•	
In case of parallel parking, where people prefer to transfer on the roadside, a clear 
space of 1.2 m must be available at the ends of the car to allow user to gain access 
to the footpaths.
•	
These slots should be located within 30 meters of the main entrance.
•	
Accessible parking must be clearly defined and integrated into street design (Fig. 3.35). 
Bulbouts can be used to address differences between parking geometry between 
accessible parking and other street elements. 
•	
Access points to and from these parking slots must be level, with a firm surface to 
enable smooth movement of users in wheelchairs, crutches and walking sticks. 
•	
Footpaths leading to and from these parking slots must also be designed to be 
wheelchair-accessible, in compliance with the guidelines stated in IRC:103-2012.
•	
Accessible parking slots should have international symbol of accessibility painted on 
it on the ground also on a signpost/board near it (Fig. 3.35). The signs should meet 
the following conditions:
	
o	
A square with dimensions of at least 1.0 m but not exceeding 1.5 m in length;
	
o	
Be located at the centre of the lot; and
	
o	
The colour of the symbol should be white on a blue background.
•	
Two accessible parking lot should be provided for every 25 car parking spaces and 
well connected with building accessible entrance/s (Fig. 3.36 ) (MoUD, 2016).

3.2.17	
Drop-off/boarding
Provide a drop-off/boarding point near entrances marked by wheelchair (access) symbol 
painted on the floor and put on a pole at height of 2 m (Photo 3.11). Passengers with 
impaired mobility often move slowly and therefore are vulnerable in bad weather. Persons with 
visual impairments also benefit from having direct access to the building entrance. Provide 
protection from the weather wherever possible. A canopy height of 2500 mm facilitates most 
passenger vehicles.

Drop-off points should be level, with a firm surface. Avoid siting manholes, drainage gullies etc. 
in areas where persons get out of cars, in particular at kerb ramps. Such items can impede 
walking sticks, crutches and wheelchairs and can become hazardous in cold weather. Drop-off 
points should not obstruct circulation areas. Avoid transfer directly onto footpaths or, if this is not 
possible, ensure that the footpath is at least 2000 mm wide at the drop-off‚ point.

ITS, traffic signals (manual, electronic)
ITS is a cost-effective means of increasing the efficiency of the urban transport network, to manage 
the crisis of congestion in urban areas, reduce the number of crashes and fatalities, improving safety 
& security of commuters, promoting public transport usage, and efficient management of freight traffic. 
Following universal accessibility measures should be provided in ITS:
•	
All visual signage and information should be supplemented with audio announcement 
and digital displays;
•	
Signal timings should be controlled as per the pedestrian volume and time interval 
allowed for crossing should be programmed according to the slowest crossing 
persons; 
•	
Pedestrian traffic lights should be provided with clearly audible signals for the benefit 
of pedestrians with visual impairments (Photo 3.12);
•	
Acoustic devices should be installed on a pole at the point of origin of crossing and 
not at the point of destination. In noisy areas, any spoken information should be 
repeated at least once. Audible traffic signals should operate at least 15dB over the 
prevailing sound level, with a maximum of 140dB;
•	
The installation of two adjacent acoustic devices such as beepers is not recommended 
in order to avoid disorientation; and 
•	
Acoustical signals encourage safer crossing behavior among children as well.

Note: Minimum dB human ear can hear is 0db and from 85dB the damage begins 
to start, whereas sound traffic noise can go from 100db up to 130db and for 
that auditory signals require 15db above the background noise.

3.2.19	
Active street edges
Active street edges provide passive surveillance of the street environment and promote pedestrian 
activity. This should be a principal aim of the design team. Increased pedestrian activity also has 
a traffic-calming effect as it causes people to drive more cautiously.
The streets shall be designed to make it active and vibrant public space. Street vendors, public 
sit out spaces and the adjoining commercial establishments make the street edges a thriving 
public space. This improves the safety and accessibility for women. ‘Eyes on street’ concept of 
urban planning shall be encouraged for a safer and accessible built environment. Where larger 
retail/commercial floor plates are proposed at ground floor level, an active street edge may be 
achieved by creating multiple entrances and/or wrapping them with smaller perimeter units that 
front on to the street.
3.2.20	
Railings and bollards
Currently designed guard-rails impede pedestrian access to footpaths. Their judicious use 
can help to ensure that pedestrian cross the streets at predetermined and safe locations. As 
the guard-rails would confine the movement of pedestrian to the footpath, it is obligatory that 
sufficient width of footpath be made available (IRC:103-2012).
Bollards are often used to stop vehicles from mounting the footpath and to keep pedestrian 
away from traffic. Unless positioned carefully, they can form a barrier to wheelchair users and 
are a particular hazard for persons with visual impairments. Where they are essential, such as 
to ensure clear escape routes, bollards should be identifiable by using contrasting colours by 
providing reflective tapes and be minimum 1 m high. To stop use by bicycles/bikes bollards at 
suitable locations should be provided with clear gap/space between two bollards should be 1.2

m. Staggered bollards do not prohibit motorized two wheelers and make it more difficult for them 
to pass through, while allowing convenient access for wheelchair users and cyclists. Bollards 
should be avoided but where necessary be at least 1000 mm high, provide a wheelchair passage 
width of at least 900 mm (Fig. 3.37  and 3.38), and should not be linked with chains.

Guardrails should not be used as a tool for directing and/or shepherding pedestrians. 
Guardrails should only by installed where there is a proven or demonstrable safety benefit, 
for example where people may inadvertently step onto the carriageway (e.g. at a school 
entrance).
3.2.21	
Wayfinding and signage
Wayfinding
Way finding references should be available at decision points. While providing way finding cues, 
following checks and measures (Samarthyam, 2013) should be taken care of:
•	
Users need clear instruction regarding the purpose and layout of the space to maintain 
a sense of direction and independent usage. 
•	
Color can be used to identify routes and provide assistance in locating doors, walls 
and hazards. Proper color contrast between different elements greatly improves 
visibility for all users and is critical for persons with low vision. For example, color 
contrasting of doorframes can assist in locating doors, and likewise floors should be 
contrasted with walls. In addition, furniture should contrast with walls and floors so as 
not to create an obstacle.
•	
Structural elements such as columns should be color contrasted or brightly marked 
so as to be visible to those who may have a visual disability.
•	
Generally, patterns on flooring should be avoided or else should be minimal and small 
to avoid visual confusion.
•	
In addition to identifying hazards or warnings, tactile floor surfaces can also be used 
to inform that there is a change in area (e.g. leaving a corridor and entering a boarding 
area).
•	
Tactile systems should be consistent throughout the building. For example, 
terminals should not have mats/carpeting in some areas and tile in others as this 
may create confusion for those who rely on tactile surfaces to guide them to their 
destination. 
•	
Good lighting assists those with a visual disability to see better and allows people 
who have a hearing impairment to lip read easier. However, care should be taken to 
properly direct lighting and to use matte finishes on floors, walls and signage, so as 
not to create glare, which may create difficulties for all travelers.
•	
Blinds can be used to adjust lighting levels in areas where the natural lighting changes 
significantly throughout the day.
Signage
•	
Signs should be mounted between 1400 mm and 1800 mm from floor level. Braille 
signboards should be located between 1400 mm to 1600 mm for accessibility and 
touch for persons with visual impairments;
•	
The surface of the sign should not be placed behind glass nor should it be reflective.
•	
Signs should be raised wherever possible so that they can be read by touch;



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:117-2018

•	
Contrasting colors should be used to differentiate the signage content from the 
background of the sign. Typically, white if used for the content and blue for the 
background. The colors must contrast with the surrounding surface to be clearly 
distinguishable. The color combinations red/green and yellow/blue should not be 
used in order to avoid confusing persons who are color blind;
•	
Audio signals should be installed at entry, exit and important movement junctions 
such as entrance lobby, lift, stairways, escalators etc.;
•	
Illumination levels on the sign surface should be in 100 - 300 lux range and shall 
be uniform. Signs should be located such that the illumination level on the surface 
is not exceeded by the ambient light or a visible lighting source from behind or in 
front of it;
•	
Sign typefaces must be standard, legible and clearly discernible. Only Sans serif 
family of fonts are recommended such as Arial, Helvetica Medium, Futura etc. Usage 
of too many type sizes on any one sign should be avoided. Italics or script texts should 
be avoided. The size of the letters must be in proportion to the viewing distance. 
Character width – to height ratio should be between 3:5 and 1:1 and the character 
stroke width-to-height ratio should be in between 1:5 to 1:10;
•	
The smallest letter type should not be less than 15 mm. All building entrances, 
house numbers and similar signage should be 150 mm; identification or 
directional signs should be 50-100 mm; while symbols should be at least 100 
mm in height;
•	
Maps and information panels at building entrance, along roads and on public buildings 
should be placed at a height between 900 mm and 1800 mm; and
•	
Overhanging signs should allow a minimum clearance of 2300 mm to allow person 
with visual impairment to pass safely.
Elements of Signage Design: All signs should be treated consistently in terms of the basic 
principles used in determining their layout, specifically: lettering, color, shape, size, design and 
placement (Samarthyam, 2014). A detail of language and letters is given in T able 3.5.

Accessibility symbol
The International Symbol of Accessibility (Fig. 3.39) must be displayed at all accessible 
entrances. If an entrance is not accessible, directions to an accessible route, including the 
symbol, must be provided. Similar guidelines refer to elevators, evacuation and refuge areas, 
restrooms and bathing facilities. Symbols of accessibility are also required to identify volume 
control telephones, text telephones, and assistive listening systems. Colour to be navy blue 
with white lettering, symbols and border and size to be 200 mm x 200 mm square with 1.25 mm 
border. The specific pictograms shown in Fig. 3.39 are required in certain signage situations.

Alternative formats etc. embossed letters with Braille and tactile
Braille, embossed letters, raised pictograms and raised arrows are tactile features that can be 
incorporated into signs, which can be particularly helpful to persons with visual impairment. This 
can occur in many ways but where signs are concerned a person who reads a sign tactually 
would want to experience all the information which is to be read as raised above the surface of 
the sign (Fig. 3.40 ).
Fig. 3.40 Braille Signage Source: (CPWD, 2014)
This information would include pictograms, text and Braille or if the sign includes mapping 
elements then every element on the map would be raised above the element on which it is 
positioned. Such signs or directory layouts/maps need to be installed at appropriate heights and 
locations so that people in both standing and seated positions can access these.
Braille signage should not replace tactile/raised text signage as many people who are blind or 
visually impaired do not use Braille as their primary form of communication.
3.2.22	
Street and road lighting
Well-designed street lighting enables motor vehicle drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians to move 
safely and comfortably by reducing the risk of traffic accidents and improving personal safety. 
Pedestrians, cyclists, rickshaws, and even some motorized vehicles do not have lights and 
depend on street lighting, not only to see but also to be seen.
From a traffic safety standpoint, street lighting is especially important in potential conflict points, 
such as intersections, driveways, and public transport stops. Additionally, lighting helps road 
users avoid potholes and missing drain covers. 
Lighting should be designed to ensure that both the vehicular carriageway and pedestrian/cycle 
path are sufficiently illuminated. On roads and streets within urban areas white light sources 
should be used, such as metal halide, white SON, Cosmopolis and LEDs. Where orange (SOX)

or softer honey (SON) coloured lights are currently used, they should be replaced with white 
light as part of any upgrade as white light highlights tactile pavers. Finally, from a personal 
safety standpoint, street lighting is essential for mitigating the pedestrian’s sense of isolation 
and reducing the risk of theft and sexual assault. Thus, improved lighting is particularly 
important in isolated spaces such as under- and overpasses and walkways next to parks or 
dead façades.
Sufficient street lighting is rare, and even where it exists, infrequent maintenance reduces its 
effectiveness. Lighting systems need regular upkeep in the form of electrical maintenance, bulb 
replacement, and dust cleaning in order to remain effective.
The following design criteria and standards should be considered: 
•	
Additional lighting should be provided at conflict points. 
•	
The placement of street lighting should be coordinated with other street elements so 
that trees or advertisement hoardings do not impede proper illumination.
•	
Poles should be no higher than 12 m; especially in residential areas, they should 
be significantly lower than 12 m to reduce undesirable illumination of private 
properties.
•	
The spacing between two light poles should be approximately three times the 
height of the fixture, as indicated in the T able 3.6 and luminance criteria is given in 
T able 3.7.

Chapter 4 
Access to Public Transport/Transit Terminals
Public transport is sustainable, cost effective and environment friendly. The public transport 
systems- approach, vehicles, terminals and boarding/alighting locations should be designed to 
suit the needs of passengers. It is necessary that the system provided is universally accessible 
for its users.
Improvements that benefit people with impairments should be viewed as improvements that 
benefit all passengers. Offering ‘Mobility for All’ for use of buses, BRTS, and MRTS is a step 
towards inclusion and improved quality of life in cities. BRTS Guidelines by IRC should follow the 
universal accessibility norms given in the manual. 
4.1	
New Constructions and Existing Facilities
Standards for mobility improvement shall be applied when a facility is being planned/under 
construction or remodeled on a large scale. Infrastructure such as new rail and bus stations and 
pedestrian facilities can be made accessible at negligible additional cost, if they are well-designed 
from the beginning. A good example is the Delhi Metro Rail system, which was designed to be 
inclusive and accessible. Timely implementation of access standards has made the system 
credible and replicable in other cities of India. 
4.2	
Essential Principles
Accessible infrastructure
Design standards for improving accessibility to and from the transit terminals and enhanced 
access to supporting facilities and services.
Accessible information
During travel, real-time information should be available visually and audibly at stations, at bus 
stops, and inside trains and buses. Travelers with visual impairments should have tactile and 
audible signage systems for orientation and way finding.
Access to T ransit T erminals and Stations
These should have well-located signs with high-contrast large print to assist persons with hearing 
and visual impairments; icons to assist passengers who cannot read; a low ticket counter for 
use by wheelchair users and short statured persons. Tactile pavers should be provided to guide 
and warn- to and within transit terminals and stops. Tactile warning pavers to assist persons with 
visual impairments are mandatory, 300 mm before kerbs and 800 mm before platform edges.
4.3	
T echnical Design Standards
4.3.1	
Bus stand/stop
General
•	
At least one accessible route should be provided from the alighting and boarding 
point of the bus stand to the walkway that leads to the accessible bus stand;
•	
Directional signs should be installed to direct persons with disabilities to an accessible entrance;



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:SP:117-2018
65
•	
Tactile guiding paver should be provided along the accessible walkway from the bus 
stand to the building entrance to aid persons with visual impairments; and
•	
The bus stand must have minimum illuminations level of 35 to 40 lux. 
Approach
•	
Passenger walkways, including crossings to the bus stops (also, include taxi stands, 
terminal/station building, etc.) should be accessible;
•	
Uneven surfaces should be repaired and obstructions, if any, on the paths of travel 
should be removed to avoid creating new barriers. The obstructions or areas requiring 
maintenance should be detectable by a white cane, which is used by persons with 
visual impairments;
•	
The walkway should not have a gradient exceeding 1:20. The cross slope should also 
be not more than 5 per cent;
•	
Texture change in walkways adjacent to seating by means of tactile warning paver 
should be provided for persons with visual impairments; and
•	
Avoid gratings in walks. 
Location
•	
Bus stand should be located nearest to an accessible entrance; and
•	
The transfer from vehicle to the driveway, pathway or walkway should be blended to 
a common level or be ramped.
Passage width
•	
A clear passageway with a minimum width of 1200 mm should be provided.
Handrails
•	
Handrails should not be concealed by tree/light pole, etc. (Photo 4.1). Handrails 
should be continuous to provide support while climbing up the kerb ramp of the bus 
stop (Photos 4.1 to 4.3).
Photo 4.1 Handrails are not Accessible due to Incorrect Placement
Seats
Seats should be provided at the bus stand for persons with ambulatory disabilities and persons 
with reduced mobility. These seats should be positioned such as not to impede the movement of 
wheelchair users. Tactile paving should be provided to guide passengers with visual impairments 
to the seating areas.

66
Shelter
•	
A shelter should be provided at the bus stand for protection against adverse weather 
conditions.
Ramps
•	
Where a bus stand is not on the same level with the walkway or pathway, it should 
have two separate ramps for boarding and alighting; and
•	
Where there are kerbs between the access aisle and the vehicle pick-up space, it 
should have a kerb ramp.

4.3.2	
BRT lanes and stops
BRT designs should satisfy the following: 
•	
Exclusive bus lanes must be provided in the center of the street except on small 
streets where mixed traffic runs as one-way on only one side of the street.
•	
The width of a BRT lane is 3.3 m, plus buffer space next to mixed traffic.
•	
At crossings, a 1 m pedestrian refuge between mixed traffic and a BRT lane is needed.
•	
Centrally located BRT stations require 3 m (preferably 4 m) in the cross section. 
Larger widths may be required if demand is high.
•	
Stations should be placed 37 m or more off intersection stop lines to allow sufficient 
space for bus and mixed traffic queues.
•	
To achieve capacities as high as those of metro systems, passing lanes, substations, 
and express services are required at BRT stations.
•	
Cycle parking is needed at stations.
•	
Stop and bus level with precision docking is essential to get leveled entry for all users 
(Photo 4.2).
•	
Serious attention must be paid to finer details like ramp (Photo 4.3) handrail design, 
surface levels, contrasting colours, wheelchair movement, etc. for these can severely 
restrict or enhance accessibility for persons with disability.
•	
Various aspects of accessibility for BRT are given in T able 4.1
•	
For more details, IRC Manual on BRT should be referred to.

Possible solutions
Priority
1. Ramps to stations
i. Crossing depth 
before ramp
The 
pedestrian 
crossing 
depth should accommodate 
wheelchair users.
Ensure that the pedestrian 
crossing is at least 1200-
1500 mm wide.
High
ii. Ramp slope
A slope greater than 1:12 
makes it difficult for people 
with limited mobility.
Ensure a slope of at least 
1:12. The ideal slope is 
1:20.
High
iii. Ramp mid-landing 
depth 
Inadequate 
mid-landing 
prevents wheelchair users 
from resting halfway up 
ramp
Ensure that if the ramp 
length exceeds 9 m, a mid-
landing area of the ramp 
width (or at least 1200-1500 
mm) 
assists 
passengers 
with 
limited 
mobility 
to 
navigate the ramp into the 
station.
High
iv. Ramp landing 
in front of ticket 
booth
Wheelchair users require 
sufficient space to turn 
around in front of ticket 
booth.
It is difficult for wheelchair 
users to wait on a slope, so 
providing a landing will allow 
a wheelchair user in line for 
the ticket booth to wait on a 
level surface.
Ensure there is a level 
landing at least of 1200-
1500 mm between the top 
of the access ramp and the 
front of the ticket booth.

v. Wall adjoining ramp
A high wall obstructs the view 
of people with wheelchairs 
to see approaching buses 
along the bus ways.
Railings along the wall can 
provide support to people 
with limited mobility.
Adequate distance from the 
wall allows for comfortable 
hand grips of the handrail.
Ensure that the height of 
the adjoining wall along the 
access ramp is low enough 
for a person on the wheel 
chair to see.
Consider redesigning the 
sharp profile of the wall to a 
straight edge.
Provide continuous hand 
rails along entire length 
of the wall. Ensure top of 
handrail is 900  mm above 
the ramp/stair.
Ensure that the railing is 
U-shaped and that the gap 
between the wall and the 
railing is at least 50 mm.
Medium
High
High
vi. T actile guiding 
pavers and 
warning Strips
All users would benefit from 
cues identifying the edge of 
the station, bus lane, mixed 
traffic lane and from cues 
for change in ramp slope 
gradients.
It is hazardous to all users 
but especially persons with 
visual impairments, not to 
indicate where a staircase 
begins/ends.
Ensure that the guiding 
pavers 
have 
a 
clear 
obstruction-free path.
Provide 
guiding 
pavers 
close to the hand rails 
along the ramps/stairs so 
that persons with visual 
impairements 
can 
take 
support 
from 
it. 
Where 
tactile guiding pavers are 
already inserted, provide 
hand rails on one side for 
support.
High
Medium
Extend the tactile guiding 
pavers 
across 
the 
bus 
way, road and sidewalks. 
They 
should 
be 
at 
least 
300-400mm 
wide. 
Consider 
extending 
the 
tactile warning strips over 
entire width where the ramp 
slope changes and before 
the top and bottom step. 
The strip should be at least 
560-600 mm wide.
Consider 
eliminating 
the 
tactile warnings on the stair 
treads.

2. Station entrances 
and exits
Station entrance and exit 
widths should accommodate 
people in wheelchairs.
Station ramps allow access 
for people on wheelchairs 
and are easier for people 
with limited mobility.
Ensure a minimum width 
of 
900 
mm 
at 
station 
entrances/exits.
Consider ramps on both 
sides of the station. If 
site 
conditions 
do 
not 
permit, indicate which side 
is accessible to people 
with wheelchairs through 
appropriate signage. It is 
preferable to have a ramp 
towards 
an 
intersection 
with enough distance for 
a refuge area of minimum 
1500 mm.
High
3. T icket counters
A person in a wheelchair 
should be able to reach 
the 
ticket 
counter 
to 
communicate 
with 
the 
attendant.
Softer edges of the counter 
are safer, especially for 
people with limited vision.
Ensure 
that 
the 
ticket 
counter is about 800 mm 
high, 
ideally 
with 
knee 
space for a wheelchair user, 
measuring approx. 500 mm 
deep and 900 mm wide, 
with 1200 mm clear space 
in front.
A second row of holes in the 
ticket booth glass closer to 
the counter would enable 
wheelchair users, shorter 
people 
and 
children 
to 
communicate better with 
the attendant.
High
Medium
Ensure the ticket booth 
glass is not reflective so 
that passengers can see 
the ticket booth agent’s lip 
movements clearly. Lighting 
inside the ticket booth that 
illuminates the agent’s face 
would help as well.
Consider 
installing 
an 
induction loop or intercom 
system.
Consider 
rounding 
the 
corners of the counter and 
providing colour contrast 
along the edge/corner.

4. Fare Gates 
i. Passageway width
Wheelchair users require 
passageways at least as 
wide as their wheelchairs in 
order to pass.
Ensure 
a 
minimum 
clear 
passageway 
width 
(excluding doors) of 900 
mm beside the ticket booth.
 High
ii. Fare gate 
configuration
If passengers can enter/exit 
from only one end of the 
station, proper signage is 
required.
Turnstiles are not suitable 
for people with wheelchairs 
and 
flap 
gates 
are 
recommended.
Provide at least one entry 
and exit flap gate per station 
entrance.
Allow 
persons 
with 
wheelchairs or persons with 
visual impairments through 
the door so that they have 
a direct route to the platform 
to enter or exit through the 
door.
High 
High
iii. Width of turnstiles/
fare gates
Width 
of 
turnstile/fare 
gates should be able to 
accommodate

users.
Wheel chair users should 
be made to turn as little as 
possible at entrances and 
exits.
Ensure a direct path of at 
least 900 mm clear width as 
far as possible for people 
with 
limited 
vision 
and 
mobility.
The station attendant can 
man the door. The tactile 
pavers should be planned 
accordingly

5. Floor surface
A slippery floor can be 
hazardous to all passengers.
Use appropriate anti-slip 
flooring material that is 
effective even when wet, 
especially along the ramps.
High
6. Seats and supports
Absence of supports makes 
it difficult for old persons to 
move, sit down or get up.
People with impaired vision 
are better able to identify 
objects with high visual 
contrast.
Provide 
continuous 
handrails on both sides 
of the platform and hand 
supports close to sitting 
areas. Ensure that the top 
of the handrail is 865-965 
mm above the floor.
Consider improving visual 
contrast 
between 
edge/
corner of benches and 
station walls/floor through 
material 
selection. 
Dark 
wooden benches against 
a lighter floor could be 
suitable.

7. Sliding doors
There might be a possible 
pinch hazard if the doors 
slide inside.
They should open outside 
the external walls.

i. Lighting
All 
persons, 
especially 
people with limited vision 
and women benefit from 
sufficient lighting in and 
around stations.
Ensure adequate lighting 
inside and around accesses 
to the station, especially at 
night.
High
ii. Colour contrast
All passengers, especially 
the visually impaired would 
benefit from a visual warning 
at the edge of the platform, 
platform-bus gap and to 
distinguish key obstructions.
Consider colour contrast for 
railings, fare gates and ticket 
counter edges. A “safety 
colour” could be used.
iii. Signage
Placing 
Route 
maps 
effectively can improve the 
movement in and around 
the station. Poor placement 
of 
maps 
can 
obstruct 
movement of passengers.
Consider placing BRT route 
map, fare details and other 
transit information at the 
bottom of the ramp before 
entering the station.
Inside the paid area, consider 
displaying static route maps, 
showing the sequence of 
stations, perhaps above the 
bus boarding doors. These 
maps are also useful in the 
buses.
LED 
signs 
displaying 
dynamic 
passenger 
information are useful to all 
passengers, so long as the 
text is large enough to be 
read at a distance.
Passengers with disabilities, 
especially 
wheelchair 
users, would benefit from 
being directed to the most 
accessible station entrance.
Ensure 
that 
messages 
displayed on the LED signs 
can be read from farthest 
points: bottom of the access 
ramp and opposite end 
of the station’s paid area. 
Alternatively, 
a 
double-
side LED display could be 
mounted above the middle 
of the station paid area.
Consider 
including 
a 
wheelchair icon in the bus 
shelter name sign at the 
ramped station entrance 
to identify the accessible 
entrance to approaching 
passengers.
Consider using a wheelchair 
icon 
inside 
the 
station, 
on an overhead sign to 
direct alighting passengers 
towards the accessible exit.

potentially hurt themselves.
Consider audible warnings 
to announce the opening 
and closing of sliding doors
ii. T ransit information

platform area.
10. T actile 
Elements 
i. T actile Information
Warning tiles indicate the 
edge of the station platform 
to 
persons 
with 
visual 
impairments and visually 
impaired passengers.
Ensure 
high 
contrast 
tactile warning strips to 
mark 
transition 
between 
sidewalks and traffic lanes, 
bus ways, station entrances 
and bottom or top of ramps 
or stairs.
High
Warning tiles in a contrasting 
colour would benefit all 
users.
Slim tactile warning strips 
can be easily missed.
Tactile 
warning 
strips 
that extend all the way to 
the sliding doors could 
harm persons with visual 
impairments persons.
Additional Braille signage 
could assist persons with 
visual impairments persons 
in independent movement.
Consider 
tactile 
warning 
strips of at least 560-600 
mm depth.
Ensure the tactile warning 
strips end about 600-1000 
mm from the sliding doors.
Ensure braille signage is 
installed preferably at all 
stations or at key stations 
for 
persons 
with 
visual 
impairments people.

11. Platform to Bus 
Floor Gap
This poses a hazard for 
persons in wheelchairs.
Ensure 
that 
horizontal 
gap is not more than 50 
mm. Vertical gaps should 
be minimized as much as 
possible to no more than 
20 
mm. 
The 
platform-
to- vehicle gap can be 
minimized by a combination 
of 
station 
and 
vehicle 
design, 
driver 
training, 
and ongoing vehicle and 
platform maintenance.

Design Principles: Safety, Accessibility, Reliability and Affordability
Fundamentally, good design addresses user abilities, needs and preferences, using technology 
to put users’ needs first. Good access practice has four design principles in common; it provides 
a travel environment that is Safe, Accessible, Reliable and Affordable (SARA)2. This can be 
done by integrating universal design elements, so that all pedestrian and transport environment, 
system, services and facilities:
(1)	
be used fairly;
(2)	
provide high degrees of freedom;
(3)	
be simple;
(4)	
be easy to understand;
(5)

By letting their work guided by these four principles, practitioners, planners and service providers 
can ensure that they are promoting improved access for everyone.
T able 5.1 provides details on how these principles may be applied.

T able 5.1 Basic Principles for Universal Accessibility
Principles
Addressing Issues
Recommendations
Safety
Removal of obstructions that could 
injure pedestrians/commuters.
Visualize a continuous three-dimensional 
travel path that is clear from obstacles, 
such as signposts, potholes, trees and 
overhanging branches. Ensure vehicle 
entrances, aisles and seats are free from 
sharp or protruding edges.
Provision of adequate warnings and 
information to prevent pedestrians/
commuters 
from 
getting 
into 
danger.
Where there are obstacles, which cannot 
be removed, provide clues to inform 
pedestrians of their existence by using 
highly contrasting paint or sometimes even 
by putting physical barriers in place.
Prolong the time available to 
accomplish certain tasks.
- Provide longer signal settings for street 
crossings. 
- Metro train/bus drivers should keep the 
vehicle stationary until passengers with 
walking difficulties have boarded the 
vehicles and have reached their seat.
Improve security to assist girls and 
women.
- Provide adequate lighting at bus stops 
and stations.
- Integration 
of 
formal 
and 
informal 
activities; like hawking zones/vendor 
areas, along pedestrian streets to ensure 
active edges and eyes on street.
Accessibility
Clear the way of physical barriers, 
such as kerb at street crossings. 
Users of wheelchairs, tricycles, crutches 
and walking sticks, require or prefer both 
a step-free surface and extra space to 
accommodate their mobility aids.
Many 
persons 
have 
reduced 
physical strength or stamina.
The design and operation needs to 
promote ease of movement – including 
short walking distances along the most 
direct routes, no steep slopes, easy entry 
into vehicles, adequate provision of grab-
bars and seats to rest on.
Orientation, navigation and way 
finding- for persons with visual 
impairments 
and 
intellectual 
disabilities, visitors and occasional 
users.
Simple design and layout makes facilities 
such as pedestrian areas and transit 
terminals easier to use.

Reliability
Increasing the modal share of the 
public transport users.
Increasing the attractiveness of public 
transport system.
Footpaths are not continuous/do 
not lead to public amenities/are 
broken, hence people who want to 
use public transport cannot access 
pedestrian infrastructure. 
- Consistency across all the elements of a 
journey.
- Attention to be paid to the whole trip 
chain.
If a passenger with disability can 
use an accessible bus to get to 
work in the morning, he/she must 
be able to trust that an accessible 
bus will be available again for the 
trip home.
Persons with reduced mobility and 
persons with disabilities, often have 
a more limited ability to respond to 
unforeseen circumstances.
- Reliability over time.
- Timely, real-time information on expected 
waiting times, service changes or delays 
enhances their ability to make alternative 
plans if needed.
Reliability
If a rail station is advertised as being 
accessible through the installation 
of lifts, then the lifts need to be 
in working order to avoid users 
becoming stranded.
Mechanical reliability
Accessible facilities/services are 
usually mixed with non-accessible 
ones; it becomes very important 
for passengers with disability to 
be able to ascertain beforehand 
whether a specific facility or service 
is accessible. 
- Information reliability 
- Consistent use of the international 
accessibility symbol to identify fully 
accessible services is useful
- Reliable signage in terminals or at stops 
benefits all users
Affordability
Transport systems with enhanced 
connectivity for all users, which is 
cost effective
- Prioritize 
walking 
and 
cycling 
infrastructure
- Provide accessible public transport, which 
costs less and is affordable by many
Adapted from Overseas Road Note 21, 2004, UK
Universal accessibility also helps in breaking myths related to special provision and covers 
attitudinal aspects. Diverse users encounter diverse barriers and require specific access 
solutions. Barriers encountered by various users are listed in T able 5.2.
