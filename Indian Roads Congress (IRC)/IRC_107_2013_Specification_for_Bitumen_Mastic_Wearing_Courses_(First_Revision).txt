SPECIFICATION FOR BITUMEN MASTIC WEARING COURSES
1 INTRODUCTION
The
Indian Roads Congress
published
the
Tentative
Specifications
for Bitumen
Mastic
Wearing Courses
in
1992. This document served the profession well
for more than two
decades. However,
in the meantime technological development in the design, construction
and controls for bitumen mastic wearing course has taken place. The Flexible Pavement
Committee
(H-2)
therefore,
felt
the
necessity
to
revise
the
document.
Accordingly
a
sub-group
was
constituted
under
the
Chairmanship
of
Dr.
Sunil
Bose
comprising
Shri B.R. Tyagi, Shri R.S. Shukla, Shri R.K. Pandey and Shri S.K. Nirmal as its members for
revision of IRC: 107-1 992. The draft document prepared by the sub-group was discussed by
the Committee in series of meetings. The H-2 Committee finally, approved the draft document
in its meeting held on
1
7
th June 201 3. The HSS Committee approved the draft document in its
meeting held on 19
th July, 2013. The Council in its 200
th meeting held at New Delhi on 11
th and
12
th August, 2013 approved the draft revision of IRC: 107 "Specification for Bitumen Mastic
Wearing Courses" after taking on board the comments offered by the members.

2 SCOPE
This standard covers the basic outlines for the design, construction and controls needed for
bitumen mastic wearing course. This document
is not for thin mastic layer on bridge decks
below a bituminous concrete layer.
The bitumen mastic is composed of suitably graded mineral filler and coarse aggregates, fine
aggregates and hard grade of bitumen as to form a coherent, void less, impermeable mass,
solid or semi-solid under normal temperature conditions, but sufficiently fluid when brought to
a suitable temperature to be spread by means of a float in manual construction and by paver
in mechanised construction.
Use of this material
is not recommended in
its present formulation in places where abundant
fuel oil dripping is expected on the pavement surface like bus depots, fuel filling and service
stations etc.
3 MATERIALS

5 EQUIPMENT FOR BITUMEN MASTIC
There are two ways of preparing bitumen mastic. The conventional method
is by using a
mastic cooker. The other method using fully mechanised units for large scale work. Equipment
details required under these two methods are available in Annexure-I &
II.
6 CONSTRUCTION OPERATION
6.1
Manufacture of Bitumen Mastic
6.1.1
The manufacture of bitumen mastic involves
different stages.
Initially the
filler
alone shall be heated to a temperature of 170°C to 200°C in a mechanically agitated mastic
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 24
======================================================================
SRC:107-2013
cooker and half the required quantity of bitumen heated at
1 70°C to
1 80°C added. They shall
be mixed and cooked for one hour. Next the fine aggregates and balance bitumen (at 170°C
to 180°C) shall be added to that mixture
in the cooker and heated upto 170°C to 200°C and
further mixed for another one hour.
In the final stage, the coarse aggregates shall be added
and heating of the mix shall continue for another hour. Thus a total period of minimum three
hours will be needed to prepare the mastic. During mixing and cooking, care shall be taken
to ensure that content are at no time heated to a temperature exceeding 200°C.
6.1.2
In case, the material
is not required for immediate use, the bitumen mastic with
filler, fine aggregates and bitumen shall be cast into blocks each weighing about 25 kg. The
bitumen mastic blocks (without coarse aggregates) shall show on analysis a composition with
the limits as given in Table 5. These blocks when intended to be used subsequently shall be
transported to site, broken into pieces of size not exceeding 60 mm cube and remelted in the
cooker at a temperature ranging from 170°C to 200°C thoroughly incorporating the requisite
quantity of coarse aggregates as indicated
in Table 3 and mixed continuously for one hour.
Mixing shall be continued until laying operations are completed so as to maintain the coarse
aggregates
in suspension. At any stage the temperature during the process of mixing shall
not exceed 200°C.
6.2
Laying the Bitumen Mastic
6.2.1
Preparation of the base
The base on which bitumen mastic is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned
to the specified levels, grade and camber as directed.
If the existing surface
is too irregular
and wavy,
it shall be crack sealed,
pot hole patched and
later improved by providing a
corrective course by adopting bituminous concrete mix or dense bituminous macadam as per
IRC:111. The surface should be dry before the layer of mastic
is
laid over
it.
In case the
surface is wet
it should be dried with a blow lamp before proceeding with further construction.
The surface shall be thoroughly swept clean and made free of dust and other deleterious
matter. Spots rich
in binder shall be scrapped and repaired. Under no circumstances shall
the bitumen mastic be spread on a base containing a binder which
will soften under high
application temperature.
If any such spot or area exists, the same shall be cut out and repaired
before the bitumen mastic
is
laid. To receive and contain the mastic, angle irons of sizes
25 or 50 mm are placed at required spacing
till finish of the job.
On concrete surface (both old and new) tack coat should be done with VG
10 grade of
straight-run bitumen. The quantity of tack coat should be as per IRC:16. On concrete surface
some extra precautions should also be taken against the problem of blistering,
like heating
the surface with a blow lamp.
If mastic asphalt
is overlaid on a fresh bituminous layer (as
corrective course) there
is no need to apply any tack coat.
6.2.2
Transportation of mix
When the bitumen
mastic,
duly prepared
including addition
of coarse aggregates
at the
manufacturing
point,
is to be transported over a long distance and delivered to the laying
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:107-2013
site, arrangements for its transport shall be made in a towed mixer transporter with adequate
provision for heating and stirring so as to keep the aggregates and
filler suspended
in the
mix
till the time of laying. However, for small works and where the laying site
is near the
manufacturing point, the mix can be transported in wheel barrows/flat mortar pans to prevent
the molten material from sticking to the wheel barrows/pans, the inside of the transport may
be sprinkled with a minimum quantity of inorganic fine material like lime, stonedust. However,
cement ash or oil shall not be used.
6.2.3
Laying of mix
6.2.3.1
The
bitumen
mastic
shall
be discharged
into
containers
sprinkled
with
lime,
stonedust or provided with lime wash. The bitumen mastic shall be deposited directly on the
prepared base immediately in front of the spreader where
it is spread uniformly by means of
wooden floats to the required thickness. The mix shall be laid in
1 m width confined between
standard angle iron of size 25 mm to 50 mm to receive and contain the mastic of required
thickness. The temperature of the mix at the time of laying shall be 170°C.
In case blowing
takes place while laying the bitumen mastic, the bubbles shall be punctured while the mastic
is hot and the surface rectified. Since bitumen mastic is an expensive material extreme care
shall be taken while fixing the angle iron and their level checked with instrument at suitable
intervals.
6.2.4
Laying bitumen mastic surfacing over an existing bridge deck
Before laying bitumen mastic over an existing bridge deck, the crossfall/camber, expansion
joint members and water drainage spouts
shall
be
carefully examined
for
their proper
functioning in the bridge deck structure and any deficiency found shall first be rectified. Loose
elements in the expansion joint shall be firmly secured. The cracks in the concrete surface
if
any shall be repaired and filled up properly or replaced by new concrete of specified grade
before laying the bitumen mastic over the bridge deck.
6.2.5
Laying bitumen mastic over new bridge deck
New concrete bridge deck which lacks adequate camber/crossfall shall first be provided with
required camber and crossfall by suitable concrete or bituminous treatment. In case of laying
bitumen mastic over concrete surface, the following measure shall be taken:
i)
For adequate bond with the new concrete deck the surface shall be roughened
by means of stiff broom/wire brush or a milling machine and shall be freed
from ridges and troughs using compressed air.
ii)
A bituminous tack coat with bitumen of grade VG 10 shall be applied on the
concrete deck before pouring bitumen mastic. The quantity of bitumen for
the tack coat shall be in accordance with the IRC:16.
iii)
After applying tack coat, chicken mesh reinforcement of 22 gauge (0.76 mm)
steel wire with hexagonal or rectangular openings of 20 to 25 mm shall be
placed longitudinally and held in position on the concrete surface before the
bitumen mastic is laid.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:107-2013
6.3
Joints
All construction joints
shall be properly fused without unevenness. These joints shall be
made by warming the existing bitumen mastic by the application of an excess quantity of hot
bitumen mastic which afterwards shall be trimmed to make
it flush with surface on the other
side.
The joints shall be painted by a coat of VG 30 grade bitumen and then treated with blocks
of the base mastic (without coarse aggregates, which contains more bitumen) and then
softened by blow lamps and toweled to flush with the surface.
It should be ensured that the
melted based mastic materials should penetrate up to the bottom of the face of joints.
It shall
be facilitated
if the vertical face of the joint is given 'Y' shape.
Care should be taken that the joints are made
in as green stage as possible, otherwise the
laid mastic asphalt surface shall
start ageing/oxidized and
is further aggravated plying of
traffic
is permitted, leading to a problem of proper bonding within a few days between old
mastic surface and freshly laid mastic surface.
6.4
Grafting of Chips
For manual
laying the bitumen mastic surfacing has a very fine texture which on
laying
provides very little skid resistance. Therefore, the bitumen mastic while still hot and in plastic
condition shall be spread with bitumen precoated fine grained hard stone chips/aggregates of
approved quality of 9.5 mm to
1 3.2 mm size, depending upon the thickness of mastic, using
bitumen @ 2 to 3% of grade VG 30 and aggregate @ 0.05 cum. per 10 sqm (5.4 - 8.1 kg
per sqm) and pressed into the surface when the temperature of bitumen mastic is between
80°C and 100°C. Such precoated aggregates when laid should protrude 3 mm to 4 mm over
the mastic surface. Flakiness Index of stone aggregates used for anti-skid measures shall be
less than 25 percent.
The traffic may be allowed after completion of work when bitumen mastic has cooled down
to the ambient temperature.
7 CONTROLS
7.1
Controls
7.1.1
Sieve analysis of each type of aggregate used shall be made at least once a day
to see that the gradation of aggregates follows the original gradation as approved. Additional
tests shall be carried out in case of variation
in grading or receipt of new supply of material.
The number of samples to be tested per day would depend upon the bulk supply of aggregates
made in a day at the plant site. Physical properties such as aggregate impact value, flakiness
index, water absorption etc., shall be determined @
1 test for every 50 cum of aggregates or
as directed by the engineer at site.
7.1.2
Two sets of test shall be carried out on each lot of supply of bitumen for checking
penetration and softening point as per IS: 1203-1 978 and IS: 1205-1 978.

7.1.3
For filler material calcium carbonate content and fineness shall be tested at the
rate of one set of tests for each consignment subject to a minimum of one set of tests per
5 tonne or part thereof.
7.1.4
It shall be ensured that the aggregates are not wet before heating otherwise
it
would affect the output adversely. During heating the aggregate temperature shall be recorded
periodically to see that
it does not exceed the limits prescribed.
7.1.5
Material
in block form shall be sampled by taking approximately equal amount in
pieces, from not less than six blocks chosen at random. The total weight of specimen to be
tested shall not be less than 5 kg.
In case the preparation of the mix
is at site, then at least
one sample for every 10 tonne of bitumen mastic discharged from the bitumen mastic or at
least one sample for each cooker per day shall be collected and following tests done:
)
Two specimens each of 10 cm dia. or 10 cm square and 2.5 cm thick shall
be prepared and tested for hardness number.
ii)
Bitumen shall be extracted from about 1000 gm of the mastic sample and
bitumen content determined as specified in Appendix C of IS: 11 95-1 978.
iii)
A sieve analysis of the aggregates after the bitumen has been extracted,
shall be done and the gradation determined according to the procedure laid
down
in IS:2386 (Part 1).
7.1.6
The temperature of the bitumen mastic at the time of laying
shall not exceed
200°C and shall not be less than 170°C.
7.1 .7
The longitudinal profile of the finished surface shall be tested with a straight edge
3 m long and transverse
profile with a camber template while the mastic
laid
is
still
hot.
Irregularities greater than 4 mm
in the longitudinal and transverse profile shall be corrected
by picking up the mastic in full depth area of the affected panel and relaying.
7.1 .8
Bitumen mastic shall not be laid on a damp or wet surface or when the atmospheric
temperature in the shade is 15°C or less.
7.1.9
In the case of mechanised laying of mastic the average speed should be kept
at 1.2 to 1.5 m per minute. Problem of formation of bubbles
in the pavement shortly after
screeding may exist because of the following reasons:
a)
The pavement surface on which the mastic is placed must be dry to prevent the
development of cavities or voids caused by trapped moisture and expanding
steam. This vapour or entrapped air escapes through the mastic mat in most
cases, but often gets trapped as the layer cooled. The situation
shall be
rectified by puncturing the bubbles with a sharp tool. A vibratory screed may
be
helpful
in causing moisture or entrapped
air to escape while bitumen
mastic mixture
is
still
hot. Such vibratory screeds with variable frequency
shall be suitable for mixes. The paving should be done in such a way that the
wheels shall be straddled to puncture the mastic asphalt bubbles.

b)
Mechanical agitation and heating of the mixture in the transporter is a must to
prevent the segregation of the mixture and to maintain a uniform temperature
in the mass.
c)
If the mastic mix appears to be sluggish, use of some rounded natural sand
in place of manufactured fine aggregate should be considered.
d)
The bitumen Mastic shall be deposited on the area
in front of the striking
off screed
in such a manner that air
is not entrapped
in the mix. This can
be accomplished by using chutes or other devices that would prevent the
bitumen mastic from being dropped.
e)
Vertical butt joints
in mechanised mastic may be formed by saw cutting the
hardened material either at the end of production each day or whenever the
paving
is interrupted and mix cooled substantially.
It
is necessary to avoid
the overlapping of hardened and fresh mixtures.
f)
Traffic may be restricted for at least 24 hour period and the finished pavement
should be power broomed prior to opening to remove excess chips.
7.2
Surface Finish
The surface of the bitumen mastic, tested with a straight edge 3 m long, placed parallel to the
centre line of the carriageway, shall have no depression greater than 4 mm. The same shall
also apply to the transverse profile when tested with a camber template.

EQUIPMENT FOR MANUALLY LAID BITUMEN MASTIC
1
MASTIC BY CONVENTIONAL METHOD
1.1
Mastic prepared by Mastic Cookers
Mastic cookers are very similar to tar boilers. These are insulated tanks mounted on wheeled
chassis. The heating of the bitumen and material is generally done by oil fired burners. Mastic
cookers have compartments. The central and main compartment is used for heating bitumen
and for preparing the mix. The side pockets or compartments are meant for preheating of
coarse and fine aggregates. Since heating
is by
oil fired burners, the temperature can be
easily controlled by controlling the flames or supply of the fuel. Mastic cookers of various
capacities ranging from
1/2 tonne to 3 tonne are used depending on the amount of work
involved.
Apart from
mastic cooker,
the
following implements are
required
for transportation and
laying:
1)
Wheel barrow and
flat mortar pans
(for short distance
haul) and
small
dumpers (for long distance haul).
2)
Wooden trowels, heavy wooden
floats, suitable hand
tool gauge,
straight
edge and hand level.
3)
Angle irons, required to contain the mastic in desired width and thickness.

f)
Weighing Section: The plant shall be equipped with a weighing system
suitable to weigh upto 5 different aggregates, two types of filler, bitumen and
two types of additives. This shall weigh the different aggregates, filler, bitumen
and additives in case required. This shall be suitable for the capacity of one
batch of two tons. This section will discharge the material after weighing to
the twin shaft mixer for homogenous mixing.
g)
The Twin Shaft Type Mixer with Hot Jacket: This shall be on an elevated
steel frame work at suitable height for facilitating pouring of the mix into the
transporters. The mixer shall have rotating steel arms or heaters mounted
on central axles and designed for efficient mixing of the bitumen and lime
powder and the aggregate. The bitumen
shall be pumped
into the mixer
from the bitumen weighing system (Equal to the requirement of one batch).
While the mixing is going on in the mixer a second batch will be readied after
discharging from the hot bin in the weighing section for immediate discharge
to the mixer. The mixing time shall be decided depending on achieving the
mix design properties as stipulated in the specifications. The mastic mix shall
then be poured into the transporter by opening the outlet gate through the
opening at the top of the transporter. About 60 seconds of mixing time in the
mixer drum or as shall be found to be adequate as all the components are at
a very high temperature and the mixing
is done quite efficiently.
h)
The Control Room and Digital Control Panels: The air conditioned control
room shall control all operations of the plant through electric sensors at various
locations. The proportioning of various components their temperature, the
weights of lime powder, bitumen and aggregates from hot bin for each batch,
mixinq time etc. shall be watched and
*
controlled
through
the
computerized
system.
It shall enable the mix to be as
,
per the job mix formulae.
i)
The Hot Oil Circulating System: As
the various components of the mix shall
be kept at high temperatures specified,
the heat loss in storage or conveyance
from the bin to the mixer etc. shall be
prevented by the hot
oil
circulation
in
the cavity
in the jackets around pipes,
the bins, the drums etc. For this purpose
the oil shall be heated in a storage tank
from which
it
is circulated by a pump
through
insulated
pipes. The
oil used
shall be thermic oil which can be heated
