Guidelines for Design and Construction of Continously 
Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP)
1 Introduction
Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP) is intended for roads carrying very 
high volume of commercial traffic and where closing road often for maintenance is difficult. 
Unlike the jointed plain cement concrete pavement no transverse joints are provided in 
CRCP but longitudinal joints are necessary if the carriageway width is more than a lane-
width. Longitudinal steel is provided in CRCP primarily to control transverse cracks which 
appear due to shrinkage taking place in fresh concrete and also hold them together. CRCP 
is different from jointed reinforced cement concrete pavement where steel reinforcement is 
terminated in each slab. USA had pioneered in CRCP work and their first pavement was 
constructed in Arlington in the year 1921. It is now very popular not only in USA but even 
in European countries like Belgium, France, Netherland etc. United Kingdom, South Africa, 
Australia, Germany and China have started experimenting with this technology lately. CRCP 
technology also has been used for construction of overlays. CRRI had taken initiative in this 
technology in 1980s and had produced a document for Rigid Pavement Committee entitled 
“Guidelines for Design of Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement with Elastic Joints, 
IRC-101-1988” (Ref. 1). This type of CRCP with numerous elastic transverse joints not only 
affects the riding quality but also increases the cost on account of maintenance of joints. 
Besides, the hardening and cracking of sealing material with age becomes a source of water 
infiltration. Therefore the present trend is to design CRCP without transverse joints. Difference 
between CRCP with and without elastic joints is explained in Section 2. When road width is 
more than 4 m there will be tied longitudinal joints between lanes. Normally shoulders are 
also tied to carriageway, but without joint for improved performance. CRCP construction in 
India is limited to small trial constructions or short road lengths in colonies or factories or Toll 
Plazas etc. India, therefore, has limited exposure to the construction of CRCP and have to 
rely on the existing international literature and state of the art for this technology.
The draft “Guidelines for Design and Construction of Continuously Reinforced Concrete 
Pavement” was prepared by the Sub-group comprising Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Satander Kumar, 
Dr L.R. Kadiyali and Shri M.C. Venkatesha. The Committee deliberated on the draft document 
in a series of meetings. The H-3 Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting 
held on 19th June, 2014 and authorized the Convenor, H-3 Committee to send the final draft 
for placing before the HSS Committee.

2 Difference Between CRCP with Elastic Joints and Without Joints
2.1	
Continuously Reinforced Cement Concrete Pavement with Elastic Joints
2.1.1	
This pavement is similar to jointed reinforced concrete pavement except that the 
steel reinforcement runs through the pavement continuously. Transverse joints are formed in 
concrete slabs by saw cut at 4.5 m spacing for full width and sealed but without discontinuing 
steel. The longitudinal steel requirement in pavement with elastic joints is normally of the 
order of about 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent of the sectional area of concrete slab as against 0.6 
to 0.85 percent (Ref 2) required for CRCP pavements without joints. Besides, the thickness 
of slab is reduced to compensate for the stresses relieved by steel bars introduced. Main 
steel deformed bars (Fe 500 as per IS:1786) are provided in the longitudinal direction at 
slightly above the mid depth of PQC Slab.

2.2	
Continuously Reinforced Cement Concrete Pavement without Joints
 
i) 
It is a jointless rigid pavement with continuous reinforcement. Normally fine 
harmless fine transverse cracks develop on the pavement at close spacing 
of about 0.50 m to 2 m. A typical cracking pattern of concrete pavement 
can be seen in Fig. 1. Crack width of 1 mm and less is said to be good for 
controlling spalls and when crack width is less than 0.6 mm it has been found 
to be effective in reducing water penetration. (Ref. 2).
Fig. 1 The Type of Transverse Cracks which Appear on the Surface of CRCP
	
ii)	
The longitudinal joints are formed between lanes especially when pavement 
width is more than 4.5 m. These are generally tied joints. In addition to 
providing transverse bars, additional bars are provided as tie bars at 
longitudinal joints. And similarly concrete shoulders are tied for improved 
performance. Longitudinal joints are cut with concrete saw and sealed.
	
iii)	
Each country has its design method for design of rigid pavement. But in 
India the design method recommended in IRC:58-2011 i.e. “Guidelines for 
the Design of Plain Jointed Rigid Pavements for Highways” can be adopted 
(Ref 3). From the international experience no reduction in thickness is 
desirable.
	
iv)	
No anti-friction layer or separation layer in the form of polythene sheet or wax 
based coating is provided over base or existing bottom layer as provision 
of such a layer would result in formation of intermittent cracks at greater 
spacing but of more width. The friction offered by base is rather helpful in 
reducing crack spacing and also crack width. As the cracks are held tightly 
by steel reinforcement, the aggregate interlock comes into play to hold the 
cracks thus improving pavement performance.

v)	
Special joints and anchor beam have to be provided whenever the CRCP 
slab abuts with a permanent structure like bridge or culvert or any structure.
	
vi)	
Similarly special terminal slabs will be required at the transition of rigid and 
flexible pavement.
	
vii)	
Providing of edge support is an important aspect of the design. Concrete 
shoulders are normally recommended in CRCP but without longitudinal 
joint.
	
viii)	 Percentage of longitudinal steel reinforcement found from international 
experience is in the range of 0.65 to 0.80 percent of the cross-sectional area 
of concrete (Ref. 2). As a matter of fact it is stated that there is no requirement 
of transverse bars but there is a need to design transverse reinforcement for 
controlling longitudinal cracks and to reduce punchouts. The pavement is to 
be textured similar to conventional concrete pavement preferably with tine 
brush. A typical cross-section of continuously reinforced concrete pavement 
is shown in Fig. 2.

3 Advantages and Disadvantages of CRCP
3.1	
Advantages
	
i)	
These pavements are rugged and are durable especially for heavy truck 
corridors or expressway.
	
ii)	
As there are no transverse joints, the riding quality remains smoother but 
noise remains more or less similar to jointed pavement.
	
iii)	
The cost of maintenance is minimal as there is no requirement of replacement 
of joint seals periodically except in the case of longitudinal joints.
	
iv)	
As there are no major repairs requiring barricading or partly closing road for 
carrying out repairs, related losses due to traffic congestion and delay do not 
arise.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC 118-2015
5
	
v)	
As there are no numerous transverse joints and widths of transverse cracks 
are narrow, infiltration of water to foundation is minimal.
	
vi)	
Life of CRC pavement is normally in the range of 30-40 years.
	
vii)	
Initial cost of CRCP is higher on account of use of steel reinforcement. But 
whole-life-cycle cost will be lower inspite of higher initial cost owing to lower 
maintenance cost especially in case of poor natural soil condition or filled-up 
areas. But cost of steel dowels, joint grooving, and joint sealing materials 
required in conventional pavement partly offsets the higher initial cost.
3.2	
Disadvantages
CRCP roads are to be avoided in the following situations:
	
i)	
In marine climate near sea coast where the reinforcing bars are vulnerable 
for corrosion, CRCP should be avoided. Either epoxy coated or galvanised 
steel reinforcement has to be used. Where such steel bars are not available 
CRCP work may not be undertaken.
	
ii)	
It is not desirable to construct CRCP where there are a large number of utility 
lines under the pavement. It is a difficult task to cut and dismantle the CRCP 
to undertake repair of pipes and other utility lines located below the road.
 
iii) 
CRCP should be avoided in roads catering to light traffic like village roads, 
urban streets and of short length on account of increased cost of pavement.
	
iv)	
Construction of CRCP using manual method should be avoided. Construction 
of CRCP with manual method will be slow and would result in construction 
of large number of transverse construction joints which adds to the cost of 
construction. Fixing stop-end or bulk-head frequently at the end of day’s work 
requires more time and resources thus increasing the cost of construction.
4 Type of Distresses
4.1	
Punchouts
Edge punchout is a major structural distress of CRCP. It is first characterized by loss of 
aggregate interlock at one or two closely spaced cracks, usually less than 1.2 m apart, at 
the edge of the pavement. The crack or cracks begin to fault and spall slightly, causing 
the portion of the slab between the closely spaced cracks to act essentially as a cantilever 
beam. Under repetitive heavy truck loads, a short longitudinal crack forms between the two 
transverse cracks at about 0.6 to 1.5 m from the pavement edge. Eventually the transverse 
cracks break down further, the steel ruptures, and pieces of concrete punch downward under 
load into the subbase and subgrade. There is generally evidence of pumping near the edge 
of punchouts. Such punchouts may not be observed so much if non-erodable DLC subbase 
is used under CRCP.

4.2	
Causes of Punchouts
 
● 
Heavy axle load
 
● 
Erosion of foundation
 
● 
Large coefficient of expansion of aggregates of concrete
 
● 
Loss of Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) across cracks. Wider crack width has 
lower LTE.
 
● 
Closer transverse cracks
4.3	
Mechanism of Punchout
The sketch showing mechanism of punchout crack is given in Fig. 3 (Ref. 4) along with a 
Photo 1.
Photo 1 A View of a Typical Punchout Formed on 
CRCP
Fig. 3 The Mechanism of Formation of Punchout 
(Ref. 4)
Due to formation of close cracks the load transfer efficiency also reduces with the passage 
of time. There has to be a balance between lower and higher percentage of steel as too low 
steel percentage leads to cracks at larger interval but with wider cracks whereas the higher 
percentage of steel results in closer cracks with narrow crack width and punchouts.
5 Typical Pavement Composition
Base and subbase layers normally provided under CRCP are not different from what is 
provided in the case of conventional jointed concrete pavement. This has been discussed 
in IRC:15-2011 (Ref. 5). Either dry lean concrete (DLC) or bituminous bases can be used 
under CRCP. Use of 5 mm thick geosynthetic layer on the top of bituminous layer has been 
used in Germany for enhancing performance. Use of cement stabilized bases has also been 
tried in advanced countries but on account of erosion, overlaying it with bituminous layer 
becomes essential. A typical pavement composition adopted in CRCP pavement is shown in 
Fig. 4.

The relative position of drainage and GSB Layers in a CRCP can be noticed in both (a) and 
(b) of Fig. 4.
5.1	
Embankment
Non-uniform support condition is not desirable for constructing CRCP. Therefore lot of care is 
required in selecting soil for embankment and subgrade construction. Embankment shall not 
be constructed directly on expansive soil. Besides Clause 305.2.1.2 of MORTH Specifications 
(Ref. 6) restricts use of expansive clay as filling material below subgrade whose ‘free swelling 
index’ value is exceeding 50 percent. Even when ‘free swelling index’ is less than 50 percent, 
subgrade and top 500 mm portion of the embankment below subgrade shall be non-expansive 
in nature. It is desirable to remove heavy clay to a depth of 500 mm and replace it with a non-
expansive soil in embankment before constructing subgrade. Adequate measures must be 
taken to provide sub-surface drainage under the pavement.

======================================================================
IRC 118-2015

5.2	
Subgrade
Subgrade of minimum 500 mm thickness is required to be provided under subbase and 
shall be compacted to a minimum of 97 percent of Maximum Dry Density (MDD) of heavy 
compaction (IS 2720-Part 8) conforming to Clause 305 of MORTH Specifications (Ref. 6). 
Minimum soaked CBR shall not be less than 10 percent at 97 percent of MDD of heavy 
compaction. Uniform support condition is essential for improved performance of concrete 
pavement and hence subgrade must be uniformly mixed with moisture and compacted to 
achieve this requirement.
5.3	
Subbase/Drainage Layer
Subbase is a lower pavement layer which is provided above the subgrade and below the 
base layer. This mix is normally produced with crushed stone aggregates. As per Clause 
400 of MORTH, Specifications, 2013 and IRC:37 (Ref. 7),subbase is constructed in two 
layers comprising of Drainage Layer (DL) and Granular Subbase Layer (GSB). Both these 
documents are suggesting placement of drainage layer above granular subbase layer. The 
relative position of these layers is shown in Fig. 4. Six gradings have been suggested in 
Table 400.1 of MORTH Specifications for granular subbase layer out of which 2 gradings i.e. 
gradings V and VI are suggested for use in subbase cum drainage layer (DL). The balance 
4 gradings are intended for use in GSB layer. Similarly there are 6 gradings proposed for 
drainage layer in IRC:37-2012. The DL should satisfy the drainage requirement in terms of 
coefficient of permeability ‘k’ which shall be about 30 m/day for satisfactory performance. Out 
of these gradings,Grading-2 has ‘k’, of 35 m/day. The maximum size of aggregate proposed 
for drainage layer is 20 mm in Table V-1 of Annex-V of IRC-37, which is helpful in constructing 
a drainage layer (DL) with minimum segregation. A grading proposed below drainage layer 
shall be such that it can perform both as separation layer and filter layer. With more fines in 
the mix it will have lower permeability. Such a layer will facilitate lateral flow of water so that 
there will be minimum soaking of lower layers. Both drainage layer and GSB are structural 
layers and are normally day-lighted. Where it cannot be day-lighted, a collector pipe is 
provided to dispose of moisture. The free draining drainage layer may pose some difficulty 
for compacting in view of less percentage of fines present in it. Sometimes stabilising it with 
a small percentage of cement or cementitious materials or commercial material (accredited 
by IRC) of about 2-4 percent as per IRC:SP:89 to achieve UCS of 1.75 MPa or about 
2-2.5 percent of bituminous emulsion may have to be resorted to as suggested in IRC:37. A 
total thickness of 250 to 300 mm of Drainage Layer (DL) and Granular Sub-Base layer (GSB) 
may be adopted in CRCP projects.
5.3.1	
Base course
A pavement layer placed below concrete pavement is sometimes called an upper subbase 
or base course layer. It is referred to in this document as a base course layer. Base layer can 
be of either Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) layer or a bituminous layer. It is important that the base 
should not get eroded due to entry of moisture. Use of granular layers and cement treated or 
modified soil can also be constructed but such layer requires high degree of quality control in 
respect of uniformity in mixing cement with soil. But experience abroad suggests that a layer 
of bituminous layer on top of such a layer can help in controlling erosion (Ref. 2). Similarly 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 29
======================================================================

IRC 118-2015
9
granular base can also be constructed provided erosion is avoided with a bituminous layer on 
the top. In view of above factors either DLC layer or dense bituminous layer is preferable for 
constructing base course. In advanced countries 5 mm thick non-woven geotextile on top of 
bituminous base has been used for improved performance in cement concrete pavements.
6 Thickness Design
In late 1980s, the pavement thickness was designed for jointed cement concrete pavement 
in USA and subsequently reduced by 20 percent in the case of CRCP. But the performance 
of such pavement was found to be not satisfactory thus requiring subsequent costly repairs 
(Ref. 8). Since then normally no reduction is done in thickness arrived at by the thickness 
worked out for jointed cement concrete pavement. Therefore for design of pavement thickness 
in India, IRC:58 can be adopted. An extra thickness of 10-15 mm may be provided to for 
compensating the wear and tear and also depth of texture. Thickness in the range of 250 mm 
to 300 mm is generally found to be satisfactory depending upon present traffic volume.
7 Design of Reinforcement
7.1	
Longitudinal Reinforcement
Due to autogenous shrinkage and drying shrinkage taking place after concreting, the CRCP 
tends to crack transversely. The function of the longitudinal reinforcement is to control the 
volumetric changes in concrete due to temperature and moisture variations and to keep the 
transverse cracks tightly closed. The primary reinforcement of CRCP consists of deformed 
bars placed in the longitudinal direction. It helps in controlling and distributing cracks in 
transverse direction with close spacing and minimal width. Normally transverse cracks form 
at a spacing of about 0.6 m to 2.0 m and their width remains at about 0.1 mm. Crack width less 
than 1 mm is helpful in preventing spalling whereas 0.6 mm or less is helpful in preventing 
water penetration (Ref. 2). The steel bars used are normally of 16 mm to 20 mm diameter 
and are of Grade Fe-415 (60000 psi). But in India TMT bars available now are of Fe-500 
grade conforming to IS:1786 which can readily be used.
7.1.1	
Design of Steel Reinforcement
Longitudinal steel percentage of 0.65 to 0.8 percent of pavement cross-section is found to 
result in acceptable crack spacing and width as per CRSI Report (Ref. 2). It is found that 
steel less than 0.6 percent may result in large crack spacing with wider cracks and high 
tensile stresses in the steel. Steel percentage more than 0.8 percent may result in very short 
crack spacing that may result in punchout development. Longitudinal steel percentage of 
0.7 percent of the cross-section of CRCP may be adopted for normal work.
7.1.2	
Vertical Position of Longitudinal Steel
Detailing of vertical position of longitudinal steel is very important on account of the 
following:
	
i)	
to control crack spacing and width of cracks;
	
ii)	
to provide adequate concrete cover to protect steel from corrosion;

iii)	
steel placed at a depth of 100 mm to 115 mm from the top for a slab thickness 
of 250 to 330 mm in the case of 0.7 percent of steel is found to be resulting 
in minimum punchouts in some study (Ref. 4).
In the light of the above statements, steel placed at about 1/3 depth of slab should be 
reasonable.
7.1.3	
Longitudinal Reinforcing Steel Design
The longitudinal steel provided in CRCP is primarily for counteracting tensile stresses 
caused in concrete slab on account of shrinkage and contraction due to temperature or 
moisture changes. An elaborate design procedure is available in AASHTO Guide for Design 
of Pavement Structures (Ref. 9) for determining percentage of steel satisfying the following 
three limiting criteria:
	
i)	
Crack spacing: To minimise crack spalling, the maximum spacing between 
crack should be less than 2.5 m and to minimise the potential for punchouts, 
the minimum spacing between cracks should be 1.07 m.
	
ii)	
To minimise spalling at cracks and water penetration, the allowable cracks 
width should not exceed 1 mm.
	
iii)	
Steel stress is usually taken as 75 percent of the yield stress of steel to 
prevent plastic deformation.
There are three equations to be solved as per AASHTO, 1993 for crack spacing, crack width 
and steel working stress to arrive at steel requirement and number of steel rods required.
But from the experience of agencies who have constructed large number of CRC pavement, 
longitudinal steel percentage of 0.65 to 0.8 percent of pavement section is found to result in 
acceptable crack spacing and width as per CRSI Report (Ref. 2).
7.1.4	
Spacing of Longitudinal Reinforcement
The clear spacing between the two adjacent bars should be at least equal to three times the 
dimension of the coarsest aggregate used for the concrete mix as shown in Fig. 5 or 70 to 
80 mm. Such clear gaps between steel bars are helpful for compacting concrete mix with 
needle vibrator. The maximum spacing, however, shall not be more than 230 mm and 
minimum spacing can be either 100 mm or 2.5 times the maximum size of aggregate as per 
Technical Advisory T5080.14 (Ref. 8).

7.2	
Transverse Reinforcement
The traverse reinforcement is provided for the full width of the pavement and these bars are 
tied to the longitudinal bars which help supporting them. The transverse bars, therefore, are 
fixed on chair assembly first and longitudinal bars placed above them. They reduce the risk 
of the occurrence and opening up of random longitudinal cracks and thereby the potential 
punchouts. The reinforcement design is based on equilibrium of base layer restraint (friction) 
and concrete contraction forces.
The area of steel for the transverse reinforcement is calculated from the equation suggested 
in CRSI Report as under:

As per the recommendations of Wire Research Institute (WRI, 1975), the maximum spacing 
between transverse bars should not be greater than 610 mm. The transverse reinforcement 
shall be kept at least 500 mm away from the transverse construction joints.
Friction coefficients for different base materials suggested in AASHTO Guide for Design for 
Pavement Structures, Washington, D.C. 1993 is given in Table 1 (Ref. 9).

8 Shoulders
Paved shoulders are essential for the safety of edge slabs of CRCP. Paved shoulders are 
helpful in preventing formation of large number of punchouts in CRCP pavement. In India 
in order to reduce the cost of construction not much of importance is given to the type of 
shoulder. Edge stress is critical in all types of rigid pavement. To reduce the edge stress, 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 29
======================================================================
IRC 118-2015
12
construction of full-depth shoulder is helpful. However, the following types of shoulders are 
also possible:
	
i)	
Full depth concrete shoulder in continuation of CRCP pavement. It is common 
practice in the United States to construct shoulders of same type as that of 
main pavement.
	
ii)	
Tied jointed plain/reinforced concrete shoulders with short transverse joint-
spacings can be constructed. The use of short joint spacing will reduce 
potential movements of the joints that otherwise might cause cracking in 
the mainline CRCP. The elimination of steel reinforcement in the JPC 
shoulders can save some construction cost. Shoulder slabs, however, must 
be connected to the main CRC pavement with tie rods.
9 Joints
Although CRCP is a continuously reinforced concrete pavement, some provision of joints is 
unavoidable. The following types of joints are inevitable in CRCP:
	
i)	
Construction Joint
	
ii)	
Longitudinal Joint
	
iii)	
Terminal and Transition Joints
9.1	
Construction Joint
A transverse construction joint becomes necessary at the end of each day’s work or when 
the paving is interrupted for more than 30 minutes on account of failure of Paver or Batching 
Plant or non-availability of construction materials. A Stop-End should be kept ready in site for 
preparing a construction joint. Additional 2 m long longitudinal reinforcement shall be placed 
in between main longitudinal reinforcement as shown in Fig. 6.

9.2	
Longitudinal Joint
Longitudinal joints are provided to control longitudinal cracks due to warping, expansion 
and shrinkage stresses caused by temperature variations when concrete is placed in large 
widths. Longitudinal joints are formed normally when slabs are wider than 4.6 m (Ref. 2). 
These joints are formed by a joint-cutting saw to a depth of about 0.3 d, where d is the depth 
of the slab, and are widened and sealed with approved joint sealant. When the transverse 
reinforcement extends over the full width of the slab, additional tie bars are eliminated 
(Fig. 7). When road width is large and paving is done with more than one pass of paver, 
transverse steel arrangement may be adopted as shown in Fig. 8. In the case of Slipform 
paving, tie rods have to be inserted in old slab by drilling holes and grouting them with 
epoxy.

Fig. 8 Longitudinal Construction Joint with Multiple Piece Tie Bars
9.3	
Terminal and Transition Joints
Terminal slab can be the first or last CRCP slab of a road. The terminal slab can be at a 
junction or middle of a road. When a CRCP terminates at any location, care has to be taken 



======================================================================

IRC 118-2015
14
to provide a smooth change over from CRCP to other type of adjoining pavement. Besides, 
the expansive pressure from continuous slabs should be dissipated near the terminal slab. 
When a CRCP is terminated at a plain or reinforced jointed rigid pavement or a flexible 
pavement, the treatments differ. If a CRCP slab abuts against a bridge abutment, a different 
treatment is required. A deep anchor beam is normally introduced behind bridge abutments 
so that expansive pressure from concrete pavement can be contained and dissipated before 
reaching bridge abutment. Transverse construction joints should be planned in such a manner 
that they coincide with anchor beam or terminal joint so that construction of an extra joint is 
avoided. For releasing expansive pressure due to temperature changes, a few expansion 
joints are normally introduced near terminal slabs.
9.4	
Transition or Terminal Joint Details
When a stretch of CRCP pavement is constructed, it normally has to be in continuation of an 
existing road section which will be either a flexible pavement or a rigid pavement. Expansive 
pressure from long length of CRCP pavement and also incompressible material entering 
cracks which restricts contraction has to be contained so that it does not put undue pressure 
on adjoining pavement/structures. The expansive pressure from central section of CRCP 
resting on a rough base is restrained in central section except for the last 90-120 m on both 
ends as per American experience. Therefore detailing of pavement at transition with adjoining 
pavements must be done to take care of the effect of last 90-120 m of CRCP. It may be noted 
that no anti-friction layer like plastic sheet is used in CRCP and the friction does not allow 
CRCP to expand or contract freely. All these transitions have to be specially designed so that 
expansive pressure is relieved and there is no blow up and at the same time the buffer slab is 
strong enough to withstand compressive pressure. The junctions are weak spots. A suitable 
sleeper slab with transition slabs has to be designed at these locations. There are primarily 
two types of arrangements which are adopted, viz, the use of series of anchor beams or 
providing transition slabs. The anchor beams are normally adopted in jointed pavements as 
the length increase is more in view of joints getting clogged with incompressible materials in 
the course of time. It is not only one anchor beam but series of them may have to be used. In 
softer soil like clayey soil, more such anchor beams may be required. The transition slabs are 
suitable at the junction of rigid and flexible pavements. The typical transition arrangements of 
a few cases are discussed in the following Paras:
9.4.1	
Transition between CRCP and Flexible Pavement
Provision of a transition slab will be necessary between CRCP and flexible pavement. 
The expansion from CRCP is restricted to the last 90-120 m as explained in Para 9.4. The 
transition slab is a stepped reinforced concrete slab which can be constructed to match with 
bituminous pavement layers. Both sleeper slab and transition slab will have dry lean concrete 
subbase in continuation of the subbase provided under CRCP slab. A couple of expansion 
joints provided at the end of CRCP will relieve expansive pressure in summer months. The 
details are shown in Fig. 9. The details of expansion joints are given in Fig. 10.

9.4.1.1	
Expansion joint
At the junction of CRC pavement and flexible pavement, a stepped RCC transition slab 
shall be provided as shown in Fig. 9. Adjoining the transition slab, a terminal slab of 4.5 m 
length shall be provided with the same reinforcement as provided in CRC pavement. Two 
expansion joints may be introduced on both sides of terminal slab for relieving the expansion 
pressure. More number of expansion joints may be required at such places. Based on the 
feedback from such constructions in the country, the number of expansion joints may be 
increased.
9.4.2	
Transition between CRCP and Jointed Concrete Pavement
A Wide Flange Beam Terminal Joint shown in Fig. 11 is proposed with two expansion joints. 
A sleeper slab is however provided between CRCP and jointed concrete pavement. Jointed 
Concrete Pavement will be in continuation of CRCP pavement with a sleeper RCC slab with 
a wide flange joint as shown in Fig. 11 with expansion joints. The number of expansion joints 
shall depend on climate, type of stone aggregates used etc.
9.4.3	
Transition between CRCP and Bridge Approach
It is necessary to restrict lateral pressure exerted by expansive pressure from CRCP slabs 
on bridge abutment. An anchor beam will help in restraining the thrust. Details of an anchor 
beam are shown in Fig. 12. Reinforcement details of the anchor beam and the expansion 
joints needed are shown in Fig. 12. It is necessary to provide one or more expansion joints 
at such locations. Providing a series of anchor beams behind the approach slab can also be 
adopted depending upon the site situation. The details of series of anchor beams are shown 
in Fig. 13.

10 LAPPING OF LONGITUDINAL REINFORCEMENT
Reinforcement bars are normally marketed upto 12 m length in India. As longitudinal bars 
are to be provided continuously in CRCP pavement, they have to be spliced by providing 
laps. The length of splicing varies from country to country, but from the studies carried out 
in the USA, for obtaining adequate bond strength, it is found that a length 33 times bar 
diameter provides good performance (Ref 2). Therefore, a lap length of 35 times the 
bar diameter can be adopted. These laps must be staggered so that weak spots are not 
concentrated in one plane. It is necessary that the laps are staggered and not more than 1/3 
splicing must be in one location. A minimum distance of 1.2 m must be provided from one 
splice to other splice. Welding is not preferred in case of TMT bars.
11 Construction
11.1	
Construction Machineries
The construction of the CRCP can be done as detailed out in IRC:15-2011 (Ref. 5). The 
paving can be done using either Slipform Paver or Fixedform Paver. Slipform Paver however 
will be operated on electronic sensor. But in small projects paving can be done using side 
shuttering using both needle vibrator and powerful modern screed vibrator. The method of 
paving shall be as explained in IRC:15/IRC:43.
11.2	
Construction Joint at the End of the Day
The termination of construction at any time needs some special preparation as longitudinal 
steel bars have to be continued beyond the transverse construction joint. Therefore, the Bulk 
Head or Stop End must have provision for inserting reinforcement with ease in the holes 
provided. As this is a weaker location additional steel has to be provided between longitudinal 
reinforcement.

11.3	
Fixing of Reinforcement on Base
Chairs made of steel or plastic are used for fixing transverse reinforcement at required height. 
Once transition bars are in position, it is easy to fix longitudinal bars over them. The chair 
assembly must be robust and should be fixed firmly to the base. The chair assembly should 
be able to withstand the weight of a heap of green concrete discharged over it and it should 
resist the lateral pressure extended by the concrete when it is being spread. A simple type of 
chairs which can be used is shown in Fig 14. There can be a welded chair assembly which 
can be manufactured in a factory with a transverse bar fixed for facilitating quick installation. 
Reinforcement in position before concreting in a road project near Pune can be seen in 
Photo. 2. As can be seen from the photograph, the chairs to support the reinforcement can 
also be made using 12 mm dia steel bars. The spacing of chairs may be from 0.5 m to 1.2 m 
and they may be staggered by 1.0 to 1.2 m.

11.4	
Construction Method
On account of steel reinforcement, dumpers or transit mixers cannot move on the base 
course layer. Therefore, mix has to be discharged from either from sides using conveyor belt 
system or with the help of large transit mixers which can load the mix from sides. If there is 
sufficient space on both sides, side-tipping from dumpers can be resorted to. Except for the 
restriction regarding the movement of dumpers/transit mixers, the paving operation is similar 
to the unreinforced concrete pavement. The details of paving operation can be as given in 
from IRC:15.
12 An Illustrative Example of Design of Steel
Let us consider that a CRCP of 300 mm thickness of M-40 grade has been designed based 
on IRC:58 and the reinforcement is to be calculated. The width of pavement is 7.0 m with 
a longitudinal joint. Longitudinal steel percentage of 0.7 percent may be considered in the 
design. Steel reinforcement to be used shall Fe 500 grade.
The reinforcement details are worked out as under:
12.1	
Longitudinal Steel Design
The width of each carriageway is 3.5 m. The steel required in each lane of 350 cm will be at 
the rate of 0.7% will be:
	
	
	
Steel required = 350 x 30 x (0.7/100) = 73.5 sq cm
Considering the use of 20 mm dia rods having a cross-sectional area of 3.14 sq cm, the 
number of steel bars required is:
	
	
	
= (73.5/3.14) 1 = 23.41 Nos.	
Say 24 Nos.
Leaving 10 cm from each edge, spacing of bars will be
	
	
	
= (350-20)/(24-1) = 14.35	 	
say 143 mm c/c
The spacing of longitudinal deformed steel bars (TMT) of 20 mm dia shall be at 143 mm 
c/c.

Spacing between reinforcing bars can be calculated using the following Equation as per the

Y = As x100/Pt x D
	
Y = Transverse steel spacing (cm)
	
As = Cross sectional of steel bar (cm2)
	
D = Slab thickness in cm
By using transverse bar of 12 mm, the area of cross-section is 1.131 sq cm.
	
Thickness = 30 cm
	
Transverse steel spacing, cm = 1.131 x 100/0.02055 x 30
	
Spacing = 183.45 cm
The CRSI Report suggests that it is common to provide transverse steel bars in the range of 
30 cm to 90 cm. A spacing of 60 cm c/c may be adopted.
