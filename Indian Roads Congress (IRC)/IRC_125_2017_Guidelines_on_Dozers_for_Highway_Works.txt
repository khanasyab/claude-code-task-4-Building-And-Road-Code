GUIDELINES ON DOZERS 
FOR HIGHWAY WORKS
1. Introduction
The highway sector in India is poised for fast development. Mechanization in the highway 
sector has seen a steady growth for the past two decades. It helps in achieving economy, 
speed and quality in highway construction and maintenance so that roads are built at an 
accelerated pace as per better standards and specifications. The aim is to avoid not only 
time and cost overruns but also to derive quick return on investment and early availability of 
better facility to road users.
Earthwork is one of the significant and basic operations of almost all highway projects. The 
main task of any highway engineer is to select and match earthmoving machinery to the 
specific needs of each particular project. There are various stages of earthwork for which 
appropriate machinery is available.
One such earthmoving equipment is a dozer. It can perform a large number of functions 
depending on the attachment fixed to the basic machine. It is also a key equipment for 
disaster mitigation activity pertaining to natural calamities like earthquakes, landslides, floods, 
tsunami, cyclone outbursts etc.
The initial draft document “Guidelines on Dozers for Highway Works” was prepared by 
Shri Niranjan Kumar Nayak and Shri Ananyabrata Maulik. Necessary inputs were obtained 
from the Representatives of Industry and incorporated in the document. The Mechanization 
and Instrumentation Committee (G-4) deliberated on the draft document in a series of 
meetings and finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 12th June, 2017. The 
document was approved by the General Standards and Specifications Committee (GSS) in 
its meeting held on 24th June 2017 and thereafter by IRC Council in its 212th meeting held at 
Udaipur(Rajasthan) from 14th to 15th July, 2017.
The Composition of Mechanization and Instrumentation (G-4) Committee is as given below:

2. Scope
This document is intended for use by the highway engineers, field personnel with in road 
construction agencies and contractors entrusted with the task of road construction and 
maintenance.
This document covers dozer selection, dozer components, and types of blades, blade 
operation and performance, dozer attachments, dozer productivity, maintenance schedules 
as well as tips for safe operation of dozers. Emission norms for dozers have been provided 
in Appendix-VI
3. Purpose
3.1.	
Dozer is a self-contained tractor-power unit with a blade attached to the machine’s 
front. It is the most basic, effective and versatile equipment which is widely used in construction 
projects and capable of performing variety of operations with attachments to the basic unit. 
Depending on the type of application, it can be mounted with either a rear-mounted winch or 
a ripper.

3.2.	
Dozers are used both as support and as production machines in construction 
projects. Some of the basic functions are listed below:
	
i)	
Clear land of timber, stumps and root mat etc. at site of work.
	
ii)	
Prepare pilot road/roads through mountains, rocky terrain and hard ground.
	
iii)	
Excavate earth or rock for a short haul distance up to say 100 m.
	
iv)	
Spreading earth or rock fills and leveling of land.
	
v)	
Backfilling the trenches.
	
vi)	
Clearing the floor of borrow, quarry pits and construction sites.
	
vii)	
Maintaining haul roads.
A detailed description of dozer applications is given in Appendix-I.
4. Dozer Classification
4.1	
Dozers may be classified into various categories based on the following:
	
i)	
Engine Location
	
ii)	
Under Carriage
	
iii)	
Nature of Blades
	
iv)	
Mode of Power Transmission
	
v)	
Job Application
4.2	
Based on engine location, dozers may be classified as front engine type 
(Fig. 1) or rear engine type (Fig. 2).
4.3	
Dozers may be classified on the basis of undercarriage as:
	
i)	
Crawler (track) mounted dozers
	
ii)	
Wheel mounted dozers
4.3.1	
Advantages of Crawler mounted dozer:
	
a)	
Ability to deliver more tractive effort, hence can operate on soft footing e.g. 
loose or muddy soil.
	
b)	
More compact and powerful, hence can handle difficult jobs over almost any 
terrain.
	
c)	
Greater flotation because of lower ground pressure.
	
d)	
Ability to travel over rocky and rough surface, which reduces cost of 
maintenance unlike damage of tires in case of wheeled dozer.
	
e)	
Can push large blade loads, handle tight soil easily and good for short work 
distance.

4.3.2	
Advantages of Wheel mounted dozers:
	
a)	
Can travel at higher speeds during operation and can shift quickly from one 
job to another.
	
b)	
Good on firm soils, concrete and abrasive soils that have no sharp edged 
pieces.
	
c)	
Can travel on paved roads without damaging them.
	
d)	
Ease in operation, hence less operator fatigue.
	
e)	
Can travel long distances on its own (unlike crawler type which needs hauling 
equipment to transport).
	
f)	
Capable of producing more output where work is spread over long distance.
	
g)	
Operation, maintenance & repair costs are lower as compared to crawler 
type dozers.

4.4	
Dozers may be classified on the basis of nature of blades as:
	
i)	
Straight or Straight-tilt dozer
In this type of dozer, the blade is fixed perpendicular to the direction of travel. It moves the 
earth in forward direction.
	
ii)	
Angle dozer
In this type of dozer, in addition to the Straight travel as mentioned above, the 
blade can also be fixed at an angle to the direction of travel. It can move the earth 
LH/RH side in forward direction.
4.5	
Dozers may be classified on the basis of power transmission as:
	
i)	
Direct drive
	
ii)	
Torque flow drive
	
iii)	
Hydrostatic Transmission (HST)
	
iv)	
Hydromechanical Transmission (HMT)
4.5.1	
Direct Drive
It is basically manual, mechanical type of transmission. A mechanical element (friction 
clutch) connects the engine to the transmission. The transmission ratio is achieved by a 
gearing system, where the gearing arrangement may be sliding mesh or constant mesh type. 
The term ‘direct drive’ derives its name from the fact that power, in case of highest gear, is 
transmitted straight through the transmission as if there were a single shaft. In all other gears, 
mechanical elements match speed and torque (Fig. 3).
Direct drive dozers are best suited for work involving constant loading conditions. A job where 
full blade loads must be pushed over long distances would be an appropriate application of 
a direct drive machine.
For direct drive dozers, some manufacturers specify two sets of drawbar pulls- Rated and 
Maximum. Rated value is the drawbar pull that can be sustained for continuous operation. 
Maximum value is the drawbar pull that the dozer can exert for a short period while lugging 
the engine, such as when passing over a soft spot in the ground that requires higher tractive 
effort over a short period of time.

(SLIDING/
CONST ANT MESH)
4.5.2.	
Torque Flow Drive or Hydrodynamic Transmission
It falls in the category of power shift transmission, that is, shifting of power takes place without 
the interruption of drive. In torque flow drive, a fluid coupling or torque converter connects the 
engine to the transmission. Power transmission takes place on account of kinetic energy of 
fluid (Fig. 4).
The torque converter transmits and decouples the engine power to the gearing system, 
thereby allowing the machine to stop with the engine still running without stalling. It provides 
a variable amount of torque multiplication at low engine speeds, increasing breakaway 
acceleration.

Advantages
Disadvantages
r	
Gear shifting operation is easy

Preferable for applications where load 
variation is high.

4.5.3	
Hydrostatic Transmission (HST)
Instead of using gears and shaft for transmitting power, hydrostatic transmission (Fig. 5) uses 
a hydraulic circuit comprising of a positive displacement pump and a positive displacement 
motor to move pressurized fluid (hydraulic oil) through a system of fluids. Usually, the pump 
is of variable flow type and the motor of fixed flow type. Power transmission takes place on 
account of pressure energy of fluid.
Rotary power from engine is converted into hydraulic power by the pump connected directly 
to the engine crankshaft. Motor then converts the hydraulic power back to mechanical rotary 
power that is further transmitted to the drive wheels/tracks. The speed/torque ratios are 
controlled by varying the pump discharge with the help of swash plates, which in turn varies 
the speed of the connected motor.

4.5.4	
Hydromechanical Transmission (HMT)
It is a power split type of transmission. The power path connecting the engine to the final drive 
has two branches- a mechanical branch consisting of mechanical element(s) and a hydraulic 
branch consisting of a hydraulic pump and hydraulic motor (Fig. 6). Hydromechanical 
transmission may be of different types- input coupled, output coupled or compound.

A diesel engine is generally used as a prime mover. It is mounted on the dozer frame.
5.2	
T ransmission System
The Transmission system facilitates transmission of power from the engine to the final drive 
at a multiplicity of speed and torque ratios depending upon load. It may be manual, semi-
automatic or automatic type.
5.3	
Ground Drive or Final Drive
The power from the transmission is given to the drive axle. The power from the drive axle is 
transmitted to the wheels and sprockets in wheeled dozers and crawler dozers respectively.
In case of wheeled dozers, the tread of the tire should be selected carefully as it greatly 
affects its tractive effort on a particular type of soil where it operates.
In crawler dozers, live axles rotate large toothed wheels, known as drive sprockets, located 
at the rear of the track frame (discussed in Section 5.4)
5.4	
Under Carriage 
Under carriage is applicable for crawler dozers only. The under carriage components of the 
dozer are subject to high impact load, severe wear condition due to riding over metal to 
metal, working in mud, hard gravel and hard stone. In order to meet these requirements, 
under carriage components are manufactured with wear resistant materials. 
An under carriage consists of: 
	
i)	
Track frame
	
ii)	
Equalizer bar
	
iii)	
Sprocket
	
iv)	
Front idler 
	
v)	
Track (Bottom) Rollers
	
vi)	
Carrier (Top) Rollers 
	
vii)	
Track chain assembly
	
viii)	 Track Adjuster (Grease Cylinder, Recoil Springs etc.)
	
ix)

5.4.1	
Track frame
It acts as a support frame on which various components are mounted. It is fabricated with steel 
plates by welding and is designed to withstand severe shock loads, bending, deformation 
and breakage. Track frame vibrations during travel are absorbed by the rubber pads (for 
improved machine life and operator comfort).
5.4.2	
Equalizer bar
It is made out of a steel box section beam or a casting beam which distributes the weight of 
front portion of the machine equally to the two track frames. Its center point is pivoted to the 
cross bar of the chassis.
5.4.3	
Sprocket
Sprocket drives the endless track chain to transmit the power for movement of the dozer. 
Sprocket is either of integral design or segmental design. 
5.4.4	
Front Idler
It supports the front end part of the track chain to allow the track to roll straight over rough 
ground. It slides at the front end of the frame between the guide plates and connected to the 
recoil spring assembly through yoke to maintain the desired track tension to keep sufficient 
engagement of the Track Rollers with the track.

5.4.5	
Track Rollers
These are mounted under each track frame and bolted on to it. They evenly distribute the 
weight of the machine on the track and the track links ride on the tread surface of the Track 
Rollers.
5.4.6	
Carrier Rollers
They are mounted on to the upper side of the track frame over a support. It guides and 
supports the upper half of the track chain.
5.4.7	
Track Chain Assembly
Track chain assembly is formed by assembling track links, pins, seals, bushings and track 
shoes using bolts and nuts.
5.4.8	
Track Roller Guards
They protect track rollers from being damaged by rocks and debris, and also prevent track 
from slipping.
5.5	
Blade
A dozer blade consists of a mould board with replaceable cutting edges and side (end) bits. 
Push Frames and Tilt Cylinders or a C-frame and Brace Assemblies connect the blade to the 
dozer. 
6. Dozer Blades
Blades vary in size and design based on specific work applications. Soil characteristics, 
moisture content, compaction and terrain will influence the decision of blade selection for 
optimizing dozer productivity. Using the right blade for a specific job will result in fuel saving, 
higher productivity and reduced wear and tear. 
6.1	
Operating Features of Blade
The operating features of the dozer blades may be of three types, which are not applicable to 
all blades, but any two of these features may be incorporated in a single mount.
	
i)	
Tilt (Fig. 8)
The design of some machines enables either end of the blade to be raised or lowered in a 
vertical plane which is termed as Tilt. Tilting enables concentration of dozer driving power on 
a limited portion of the blade’s length.

Fig. 8: T ilting of Dozer Blade
	
ii)	
Pitch (Fig. 9)
The top of the blade can be moved forward or backward varying the angle of attack of 
the cutting edge, which is termed as Pitch. This is a pivotal movement about the point of 
connection between the dozer and the blade. When top of the blade is pitched forward, the 
bottom edge moves back, and this increases the angle of attack of the cutting edge.
Fig. 9: Pitching of Dozer Blade
	
iii)	
Angling (Fig. 10)
Blade mounted on a C – frame or a U – frame can be turned from the direction of travel, 
which is termed as Angling. Angling causes the pushed material to roll off the trailing end of 
the blade. This procedure of rolling material off one end of the blade is called side casting.

Fig. 10: Angling of Dozer Blade
6.2	
Blade Operation 
The blade is raised or lowered hydraulically. The pitch, tilt and angling of the blade are 
controlled hydraulically. Specifications generally indicate the type and capacity of the pump, 
the relief pressure of the system, and the bore and stroke of the lift, pitch, tilt and/or angling 
cylinders.
Additionally, basic earthmoving blades are curved in the vertical plane in the shape of a 
flattened C. When the blade is pushed down, the edge cuts into the earth. As the dozer 
moves forward, the cut material is pushed up the face of the blade. The upper part of the 
flattened C rolls this material forward. The total effect is to “boil” the pushed material over 
and over in front of the blade. The flattened C shape provides the necessary cutting angle for 
the edge and at the beginning of the pass, the weight of the cut material on the lower half of 
the C helps achieve edge penetration. As the push progresses, the load in front of the blade 
passes the midpoint of the C and begins to exert an upward force on the blade. This “floats” 
the blade reducing the penetration of the cutting edge.

T ypes of Blade 
Many different special application blades may be attached to a dozer, but basically the 
following types of blades are common for application in the highway sector:
	
i)	
Straight blade ‘S’
	
ii)	
Angle blade ‘A’
	
iii)	
Universal blade ‘U’
	
iv)	
Semi-U blade ‘SU’
	
v)	
Cushion blade ‘C’
	
vi)	
Power, Angle and Tilt Blade ‘PAT’
Note: Other types of blades like K/G Blade, Variable Radius Blade, Rake etc. are also 
available.
6.3.1	
Straight Blade ‘S’ (Fig. 13)
It is designed for short and medium distance passes such as backfilling, stumping, stripping, 
shaping, ditching, grading and spreading fill material. It has no curvature along its width 
and is mounted in a fixed position, perpendicular to the dozer’s line of travel. It is attached 
to the dozer machine by dozer arms at the lower corners of the back of the blade, thereby 
eliminating the option of angling. The S blade is vertically stabilized with angle braces to 
the dozer arms that may be outfitted with a hydraulically operated tilt cylinder allowing for 
horizontal adjustment.



======================================================================

IRC:125-2017

Generally straight blade is a heavy duty blade and can be tilted within a 10°arc, increasing 
penetration for cutting or decreasing penetration for back dragging. It can be equipped to 
pitch for enabling the operator for setting the cutting edge to dig hard materials or moving the 
edge’s plane of attack to ease the drifting of light materials.
Given the straight configuration and lack of side wings to hinder material side spillage, the 
S blade has limited material carrying capabilities. The rugged design, weight and geometry 
of the blade give it good penetrating characteristics which allow for better dozing of harder 
materials.
S blade provides excellent versatility. Being physically smaller than the SU or U blade, it 
is easier to maneuver and can handle a wider range of materials. It has a higher KW/m of 
cutting edge than the SU or U blade and, therefore, is more aggressive in penetrating and 
obtaining a blade load.

6.3.2	
Angle Blade ‘A’ (Fig. 14)
An angle blade is wider than ‘S’ blade. It can be angled up to a maximum of 25° left or right of 
perpendicular to the dozer or can be used as a straight blade. Since angle blade is attached 
to the dozer by a C – frame mount, it can be tilted. To facilitate vertical stability of blade, it is 
provided with either manual screw type tilt adjusters or hydraulically operated tilts on one or 
both of the side arms.
The angle blade is highly effective for side casting of material particularly for back filling 
or making side-hill cuts. It can also be used for stumping, stripping, shaping, ditching, trail 
pioneering and general dozing of medium to softer materials.

Fig. 14: Angle Blade
6.3.3	
Universal Blade ‘U’ (Fig. 15)
This blade is wider than a straight blade and the outside edges are canted forward about 
25°. The canting of the edges reduces the spillage of loose material, making the U blade 
efficient for moving large loads over long distance. It is mounted with heavy dozer arms 
from trunnions on the sides of the tractor to the lower bottom corners of the blade. The U 
blade is made vertically stable from the push arms with angle braces that incorporate one or 
two hydraulic tilt cylinders. The tilt cylinders provide the blade with the ability to concentrate 
the ground penetrating forces, thereby increasing versatility to include operations such as 
ditching and crowning.
The KW/m ratio is lower than the S or SU blade mounted on a similar dozer, which indicates 
that penetration is not a prime objective of this blade. The KW/cum is also lower than the S 
or SU blade which denotes the blade is best suited for lighter materials. This blade is mainly 
used for stockpile works, trapping for loaders and land reclamation.

6.3.4	
Semi-U Blade ‘SU’ (Fig. 16)
Semi-U blade has the combined features of both ‘S’ and ‘U’ blade designs. It increases 
material loading and carrying capacity due to addition of forward curving short wings on 
either end that work to limit material spillage.
It is mounted to the tractor with heavy straight push arms attached to the lower back of the 
blade. The blade is made vertically stable from the dozer arms with angle braces which 
will incorporate one or two hydraulic tilt cylinders. The tilt cylinders provide the ability to 
alter the horizontal plane of the blade and concentrate ground penetrating forces. This 
feature increases the blade versatility to include crowning and ditching. It has lower ground 
penetration ability than S blade.
SU blade is well suited for activities like stumping, stripping, backfilling, ditching, crowning 
and leveling. It works well in soft to medium hard soils, especially with the skillful application 
of the tilt feature.
Fig. 16: Semi-U Blade
6.3.5	
Cushion Blade ‘C’ (Fig. 17)
Cushion blade is effectively used for pushing the material and not suitable for production 
dozing purposes. It cannot be tilted, pitched or angled. It is generally mounted on large 
dozers that are used for push-loading scrapers. This blade is shorter than the S blade which 
facilitates maneuvering into position behind the scrapers. The use of cushion blade instead 
of a “pusher block” to push scrapers can clean up the cut area and increase the total fleet 
production.

6.3.6	
Power, Angle and Tilt Blade ‘PAT’ (Fig. 18)
It is a special type straight blade. Here, it is possible to hydraulically raise, tilt and angle the 
blade. Applications include grading, backfilling, land clearing, ground leveling and spreading 
operations.
Fig. 18: PAT Blade
6.4	
Blade Performance 
Performance potential of a dozer is measured by two standard ratios:
	
i)	
Kilowatt per metre of cutting edge.
	
ii)	
Kilowatt per loose cubic metre of material retained in front of the blade.



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 58
======================================================================

IRC:125-2017
19
6.4.1	
Kilowatt per metre (KW/m) provides an indication of the ability of the blade to 
penetrate and obtain a load. The higher this ratio, the more aggressive the blade is.
6.4.2	
The pushing potential of a particular blade is the relationship between available 
machine Kilowatt and volume of displaced material. Kilowatt per loose cum (KW/cum) 
provides an indication of the blade’s ability to push a load. A higher ratio means that the dozer 
is more productive.
7. Dozer Att achments
The optional attachments usually available for dozer are listed below:
	
i)	
Ripper
	
ii)	
Winch
	
iii)	
Swinging Drawbar
7.1	
Ripper (Fig. 19)
Ripper is an optional attachment connected to the rear of the dozer by means of a mounting 
bracket and is equipped with one or more teeth. It is used to loosen densely compacted 
materials so that the dozer blade will be able to penetrate and push easily. Rippers are able 
to penetrate where a blade will simply scrape along.
Today, ripping has become a popular method of excavating soil and rock. It is mostly used 
to excavate overburden. Cost of ripping should be compared with the cost of drilling and 
blasting to consider economical way of excavation.

Ripping is preferred over drilling and blasting for the following reasons:
	
i)	
Increased productivity due to continuous operation of machine and reduced 
idle time
	
ii)	
Minimized ground vibration 
	
iii)	
Reduced noise and dust

7.1.2	
The following types of rippers are used with the dozer as attachment:
	
i)	
Radial type (Fig. 20)
Here, the ripping angle of the tooth tip to the ground varies according to change in the 
working depth.

ii)	
Parallelogram type (Fig. 21)
Here, the ripping angle of the tooth tip to the ground remains constant regardless of variations 
in the working depth.

iv)	
Impact type
	
	
It exerts an additional impact force by means of a hydraulic pulsing system.
7.1.3	
The various parts of a typical ripper are shown in Fig. 23.
The Ripper Point or Tip can be replaced whenever it breaks or wears out, and it protects 
the shank and adapter from damage. When adapter is breaking frequently, the next shorter 
tip should be used so as to reduce the load on the adopter. The Protector is provided as an 
additional protection for the adapter and is replaced when it is worn out.
Fig. 23: T ypical Parts of a Ripper
7.1.4	
Ripper selection depends on degree of rippability of rock, which is governed by 
the following factors:
	
i)	
Nature and formation of rock (Igneous and metamorphic rocks are difficult 
to rip in absence of substantial fractures or weak planes while sedimentary 
rocks are more amenable to ripping due to presence of clear planes of 
stratification.)
	
ii)	
Brittleness and crystalline structure of rock
	
iii)	
Degree of stratification and lamination of rock
	
iv)	
Well defined fracture plane
	
v)	
Moisture content (Presence of moisture reduces the shear strength of rock 
and makes it suitable for ripping.)
	
vi)	
Geological disturbances like faults, joints, fractures and planes of weakness
	
vii)	
Grain size (Coarser the grain size, the more suitable it is for ripping.)

viii)	 Degree of consolidation of rock
	
ix)	
Mechanical properties of rocks like compressive strength, tensile strength, 
shear strength etc.
	
x)	
Specific energy
Rippability analysis of a particular site should preferably include geological site survey, field 
seismic velocity measurements, laboratory analysis of rock properties and an equipment 
investment analysis in order to facilitate selection of the appropriate ripper.
7.1.4.1	
Ripper selection also involves choosing the correct tip configuration as well as the 
correct style (centerline or penetration). T able 6 illustrates the recommendations to obtain 
optimal performance from the ripper.
Table 6: Recommendations for Selection of Tip Configuration of Ripper
Sl. No.
Tip Configuration
Recommended Usage Condition
1
Short 
For use in high impact conditions where breakage problems 
occur. The shorter the tip, the more it resists breakage.
2
Intermediate
For use in moderate impact conditions where abrasion is 
not excessive.
3
Long
For use in loose, abrasive materials where breakage is not 
a problem.
7.1.4.2	
The material being ripped as well as the dozer will both have an effect on which 
tip will do the best job. High density material requires a ‘penetration’ tip whereas high impact 
material requires a ‘centerline’ tip.
7.2	
Winch (Fig. 24)
A winch is a frame equipped with a drum and connected to the rear of the dozer. Applications 
include uprooting of trees, skidding of boulders or heavy materials, general/ equipment 
recovery etc.

7.2.1	
There are two types of winch operation:
	
i)	
Manually controlled Winch
	
	
It is operated by a manually controlled clutch and brake.
	
ii)	
Power controlled Winch
	
	
It is operated hydraulically or by a power clutch and brake.
7.2.2	
Winch performance is determined by maximum line pull and maximum line speed. 
Line pull is the winch pull force measured at engine rated speed with full drum and bare 
drum. Line speed is the winch speed measured at engine rated speed with full drum and bare 
drum.
7.3	
Swinging Drawbar (Fig. 25)
It is a frame, equipped with a swing selector bar and a drawbar, and is connected to the 
rear of the dozer. It is used for haulage purpose and its performance is determined by the 
maximum drawbar pull of the dozer.
Fig. 25: Dozer with Swinging Drawbar Attachment
8. Dozer Performance
Blade selection is not the sole criterion for maximizing production. Dozer limitations based 
on traction, rolling resistance, grade resistance of work site etc. need to be kept in mind at 
the time of dozer selection to ensure that the blade and the machine are compatible for the 
particular job at hand. The weight and engine power of the dozer determine its ability to push.
The primary objective while selecting a dozer is to identify the kind of work it will be doing most 
of its life because dozer performance will vary with the material characteristics as illustrated 
in T able 7.

T able 7: Effect of Material Characteristics on Dozer Performance
Sl. No. Material Characteristics
Remarks
1
Material Size and shape
The larger the individual material (particle) size, the 
harder it is for a cutting edge to penetrate. Materials 
with sharp edges resist the natural rolling action of 
dozer blade. These materials require more engine 
power to move than a similar volume of material with 
rounded edges.
2
Voids
Few voids or the absence of voids means the individual 
particles have most or all of their surface area in contact 
with other particles. This results in a stronger bond and 
thus greater engine power is required to move such 
material.
3
Moisture Content
The lower the moisture content of the material, the 
greater is the bond between particles and thus greater 
engine power is required to move such material.
The following parameters help in performance evaluation of a dozer with respect to its weight 
and engine power:
8.1	
Net Power 
It is the power obtained on a test bed at the end of the crankshaft or its equivalent, at the 
corresponding engine speed (refer to ISO 9249:2007).
8.2	
Maximum T ravel Speed
It is the maximum speed that can be obtained on a hard level surface in each of the forward 
and reverse gear ratios available with the machine at its operating mass, as determined in 
accordance with ISO 6014.
8.3	
T ractive Effort
The tractive effort is the usable force available to perform work and is limited by the following 
two factors:
	
i)	
Weight carried by the drive wheels
	
ii)	
Coefficient of traction of the surface being traversed
Dozer weight is important in many projects because the maximum tractive effort that a unit 
can provide is limited by the product of the weight times the coefficient of traction for the unit 
and the particular ground surface, regardless of the power of the engine.
The crawler dozer is designed for jobs requiring high tractive effort. 
In case of wheeled dozers, the coefficient of traction between rubber tires and soil surfaces 
is lower and, therefore, the wheel tractor may slip before developing its rated pulling effort. In 
order to attain higher speed, a wheeled dozer must sacrifice pulling effort.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 58
======================================================================
IRC:125-2017
26
Traction or floatation requirements can be met by proper under carriage or tire selection. 
For a dozer operating at a given engine power, the available tractive effort decreases as its 
travel speed increases.
8.4	
Drawbar Pull
The available pull that a dozer can exert on a load that is being towed is referred to as its 
drawbar pull. It depends on the effect of grade resistance and rolling resistance at the work 
site and is equal to the difference between the tractive effort available and tractive effort 
required to overcome these effects.
Rolling resistance is primarily due to tire flexing and penetration of the travel surface, whereas 
grade resistance represents that component of vehicle weight which acts parallel to an 
inclined surface. For uphill movement along an inclined surface, grade resistance is positive, 
and, for downhill movement, it is negative.
Drawbar Pull varies inversely with the speed of each gear. It is highest in the first gear and lowest 
in the top gear. Fig. 26 shows the typical variation of drawbar pull of a dozer with its speed.
Fig. 26: T ypical Drawbar Pull Performance Chart of a Crawler Dozer
Note: The term ‘Drawbar Pull’ is normally used in case of crawler dozers only. For wheeled 
dozers, the term ‘Rimpull’ is used.

8.5	
Static Slope Capacity
It is the maximum slope, expressed in degrees, that the machine fluid system(s) can operate 
on without malfunction or damage of any fluid system, at all machine orientations- longitudinal 
or lateral, in accordance with ISO 10266:1992.
It will be higher for a dozer with no load compared to that with load.
9. Dozer Productivity
9.1	
Dozer operation essentially comprises of a series of cyclic operations or cycles. 
Standard hourly production is the amount of material removed per hour and may be estimated 
as follows:
Q = (A x 60 x E)/ Cm
Where,
	Q	
=	
Standard hourly production of dozer in cubic metres,
	A	
=	
Production per cycle in cubic metres,
	E	
=	
Correction Factor,
	Cm	 =	
Mean cycle time in minutes
9.2	
Production per cycle (A) in cubic metres for dozer may be estimated as:
A = FB x W x H2
Where,
	
FB = Blade Factor,
W = Width of blade (exclusive of end bits) in metres,
	
H = Effective Height of blade in metres
Value of blade factor will depend upon the type of blade as follows:

9.3	
Mean cycle time for a dozer is composed of two components- fixed time and 
variable time. Variable time is the time spent on travelling and is a function of the distance 
travelled as well as speed of the dozer. Speed of travel depends on several job factors like 
rolling resistance, grade resistance, altitude and power rating of the dozer. Fixed time is 
the time spent in the performance of all operations other than travelling, such as loading, 
dumping, turning, gear shifting, etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 58
======================================================================
IRC:125-2017
28
9.3.1	
Mean cycle time (in minutes) for dozer may be calculated as follows:
Cm = (Dt/Vt) + (Dr/Vr) + tt
Where,
	
Dt	= Travel distance in metres,
	
Dr	= Return distance in metres,
	
Vt = Travel speed (during pushing load) in metres/minute,
	
Vr = Travel speed (during return) in metres/minute,
	
tt = Fixed time in minutes
9.3.2	
Speeds for a dozer in operation will generally range from 3 to 5 km/hr for forward 
motion and 5 to 7 km/hr for reverse motion. Actual speeds shall however be selected based 
on manufacturer’s specifications. In case of dozers fitted with torque converters, actual 
speeds may be calculated as given below:
	
Travel speed = Maximum speed x 0.75

where,

9.4.1	
Time Efficiency (E1)
Dozer is never operated all the 60 minutes in an hour. A value of 45-50 min/hr will be appropriate 
for day operation and 40-45 min/hr for night operation. The cycle time will therefore, need to 
be corrected taking this aspect into consideration. For instance, assuming dozer operation 
for only 50 minutes every hour, the time efficiency works out to 0.83.
9.4.2	
Working Efficiency (E2)
Dozer output is also affected by job and management factors. The job factors which are inherent

in the job itself relate to site topography, available working space, climatic conditions, geology 
of the area affecting method of dozing, specification of work etc. Management factors pertain 
to efficiency of the organization and operating staff, appropriateness of the equipment for the 
job, job planning, supervision, maintenance of the equipment etc. It is on the management 
aspects that the Site Engineer should apply all his efforts for improving the efficiency and 
productivity of dozer operation. For estimation of standard production of dozers, the following 
values for working efficiency are recommended [as per IS: 11399 (Part-I), 1985].

It may be noted that the volume of material in standard production (Section 9.1) 
pertains to soil in loose condition. Dozer output is generally expressed in terms of ‘bank 
measure’, which is a measure of the soil in-situ. Dozing/excavation of a given weight of 
material causes its volume to increase due to air pockets and voids and it is in this loose state 
that the equipment has to move the material. 
Therefore, the net hourly production of a dozer (Qn), expressed in cubic metres of ‘bank 
measure’, may be calculated as:
Qn = Q x LF
where,
	
Q = Standard hourly production in cubic metres,
	
LF = Load Factor
Load factor may vary from 0.5(50% voids) to 0.95(5% voids) depending on the material 
characteristics and its condition (voids) in-situ.
10. Dozer Maintenance
Dozer is expensive as well as critical equipment for all highway projects which is meant for 
heavy duty applications and operated often under severe operating conditions. It is therefore 
imperative that proper maintenance of dozer is ensured for its trouble free operation as repair 
after failure can be 10 to 15 times more expensive than repair before failure. Failure to adhere 
to proper maintenance intervals and procedures may result in diminished performance of the 
machine and/or accelerated wear of components.

The success of an effective maintenance strategy lies in properly timing the replacement 
and overhaul of individual components so that they do not waste the residual life of the 
machine as a whole since individual life span of the components is less than the machine 
life. Dozers that operate in severe operating conditions may require frequent maintenance. 
Maintenance intervals have to be determined depending upon factors like number of working 
hours, load factor, equipment age, intuition and experience with the equipment, site condition, 
environmental factors etc., using suitable parameters for purpose of calculation of interval 
like fuel consumption, service hours, or calendar time, whichever occurs first.

11. Dozer Safety
Since dozers are bulky and are designed to move large amounts of earthwork and other 
construction material with each push, they can result in serious injury or even death, if not 
operated properly. 
Dozer safety is to be ensured at 3 levels, viz. equipment safety, operator safety 
and safe operating practices.
11.1	
Equipment Safety
Dozers to be equipped with Roll over Protective Structure (ROPS) and/or Falling Object 
Protective Structure (FOPS), Crankcase and Radiator protective guards.
Safety features and protective measures incorporated in the machine to be in accordance 
with those listed in ISO 20474-1:2008 and ISO 20474-2:2008.
11.2	
Operator Safety
	
i)	
Crew Members working within the dozer work area to wear Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) (for example orange vests, safety helmets/ hard 
hats, steel-toed safety shoes, and long pants).
	
ii)	
Eye protection to be worn wherever there is a danger of falling or flying 
debris from equipment or loads, particularly in windy conditions.

there is danger of cuts or puncture injury.
	
iv)	
Hearing protection to be worn when exposed to noise levels exceeding 
85dBA.
	
v)	
Operator to always use seat belt while operating the machine.
	
vi)	
Operator to mount and dismount the dozer using only the steps and handholds 
provided on the dozer.
11.3	
Safe Operating Practices
11.3.1	
Pre-Operation Activities
	
i)	
Carrying out pre-shift inspection of the dozer, that includes fluid levels, 
brakes, steering, lights and signals, tires, hydraulic cylinders/lines, horns, 
operating controls, seat belts and safety devices.
	
ii)	
Operator must have a thorough understanding of the information provided in 
the operation manual supplied by the OEM with particular attention given to 
details of safety procedures.
	
iii)	
Qualified and properly trained operators only to be allowed for dozer 
operation.

DOZER APPLICATIONS
1.	
Land Clearing
Clearing of the land involves several operations depending upon the condition of soil and 
topography, the amount of clearing required, type of vegetation and the purpose for which 
clearing is done. The operations may include, removal of soil to remove unevenness of the 
ground, removal of trees and stumps including roots, removal of vegetation etc.
2.	
Stripping
It is the removal of top soil that is not usable. Stripping is planned in such a way that haulage 
distance is minimum. For distances up to 100 meters, dozer is preferred, but for greater 
distances, scrapers should be deployed.
3.	
Side hill Cutting
Side hill cuts should always be started from the top and then worked downward.
4.	
Backfilling
Here, material is pushed ahead of the dozer over embankments into ditches or against a 
structure. Angle dozers are found more suitable for this job as they can drift material into the 
trench while maintaining forward motion, Fig. 27.
Fig. 27: Culvert Backfilling by Dozer



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 58
======================================================================

IRC:125-2017
35
5.	
Ditching
Rough ditches can be prepared by using dozer. These are constructed with a straight blade 
by working at right angles to the length of the ditch.
Small shallow ditches are usually cut with a motor grader. Large deep ditches are either cut 
with excavators or, if the cut is made before water enters the ditch, scrapers can be used. A 
dozer will follow the scraper and perform the final dressing of the slopes.
6.	
Spreading
Dozer can be used for spreading the material hauled by trucks, scrapers etc. Depth of spread 
is adjusted considering the thickness required, Fig. 28.
Fig. 28: Spreading by Dozer
7.	
Dozing rocks and frozen ground
Rocks are generally removed by using one corner of the blade. Full power is thus applied on 
this section of the blade. Large sections of rocks are removed by using the blade to lift the 
rock, simultaneously applying power to the tracks.
In a similar fashion, dozer can be used to move frozen ground.
8.	
Maintenance of haul  roads
9.	
Clearing the floors of borrow and quarry pits
10.	
Digging
A dozer while moving forward with the blade inserted in the soil digs it. If the blade is lowered 
further, more work can be done, thereby increasing the resistance as a thick slice requires 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 58
======================================================================
IRC:125-2017
36
more digging power than a thin one. The blade, during operation, should be lowered or raised 
gradually to avoid bumps in the path.
11.	
Breaking Pile
A pile may be knocked down by walking into it with the blade at the desired grade, after which 
it may be spread or piled elsewhere. If the heap is too large, it may be cut away in parts, 
either directly, or if it is not possible, the side cut should be repeated from different angles.
12.	
Slot Dozing
Slot dozing is the technique whereby the blade end spillage from the first pass or the sidewalls 
from previous cuts are used to hold material in front of the dozer blade on subsequent passes 
Fig. 29. When employing this method to increase production, cuts are to be aligned parallel, 
leaving a narrow uncut section between slots. Then, the uncut sections are to be removed 
by normal dozing. This technique prevents spillage at each end of the blade and usually 
increases production by about 20%. The production increase is dependent on the slope of 
the push and the type of material being pushed.
Fig. 29: Slot Dozing
13.	
Blade-t o-blade Dozing
Another technique used to increase dozer production is blade-to-blade dozing (also referred 
to as side-by-side dozing) Fig. 30.
As the names imply, two machines maneuver so that their blades are right next to each other 
during the pushing phase of the production cycle. This reduces the side spillage of each 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:125-2017
37
machine by 50%. The extra time necessary to position the machines together increases 
that phase of the cycle. Therefore, the technique is not effective on pushes of less than 15m 
because of the excess maneuver time required. When machines operate simultaneously, 
delay to one machine is in effect a double delay. The combination of less spillage but increased 
maneuver time tends to make the total increase in production for this technique somewhere 
between 15 and 25%.

DOZER OPERATING SPACE
The minimum space required for turnaround of a dozer governs its maneuverability at work 
site and depends upon the steering mechanism/ technology.
A conventional crawler dozer does a pivot steering, through the conventional clutch and 
brake steering mechanism, with the inner track as axis and, therefore, requires space around 
for the machine to turn. 
A crawler dozer with differential steering mechanism is capable of spinning about a vertical 
axis passing through its center of gravity (through counter rotation of tracks) and make a 180º 
turn. Thus, there is no need to move the machine forward or reverse.

Fig. 31 illustrates how intelligent dozing helps optimize dozer performance as per 
target design data for applications ranging from heavy (rough) dozing to finish grading. 
Loading of the blade at the start of the cut is controlled as per set parameters. During the 
pass, if the load on the blade increases during heavy dozing operation, the blade is 
automatically raised to control the load and minimize shoe (track) slip to ensure efficient 
dozing. When the blade approaches the target design surface, the blade will follow it for 
accurate finish grading.

EMISSION NORMS 
While mechanization in the highway sector has contributed immensely in reducing project 
costs and ensuring quality and speedy disposition of work, consumption of fossil fuels to run 
the various machinery, plants and equipment is increased many folds, thereby leading to 
environmental hazards and pollution. It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between 
the two such that the carbon footprint in the highway sector due to mechanization does not 
exceed the emission norms.
As per the Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Notification 
No. GSR 276(E), dated 10.11.2007, the limit values of emission norms applicable for both 
type approval (TA) and conformity of production (COP) testing in respect of construction

Estima tion of Dozer Productivity - Practical  Approach
A practical approach to estimate dozer productivity is to refer to the chart that the OEM 
generally provides for the various models of machines manufactured by it under the dozer 
family (taking into consideration ideal conditions of dozer operation) and, thereafter, work out 
the dozer output of the individual machines for the expected average haul distance as per 
site conditions. 
Fig. 32 illustrates the typical productivity (under ideal test conditions) in terms of loose volume 
versus average haul distance for various engine power capacities of dozers with semi-U 
blades available in the market.
Fig. 32: T ypical Estimated Dozing Production versus Average Dozing Distance for a Dozer
Actual dozer productivity depends more on the condition of material (loose or packed) and 
how difficult it is to be cut and drifted than on the type of material. Taking suitable correction 
factor into account, it will generally be seen that the actual dozer productivity will be between 
30% to 70% of that indicated by the chart (Fig. 32) for the corresponding haul distance.
For dozers with semi-U blade, engine power of greater than 160 HP and having average haul 
distance of 50 m, the productivity under ideal test conditions is usually not less than 380 cum/
hour (loose volume) and, assuming a correction factor of 0.6 (refer to Appendix-VIII), works 
out to not less than 230 cum/hour (loose volume).

SAMPLE CALCULATION FOR ESTIMA TION OF  
DOZER OUTPUT/ ACTIVITY DURA
TION
Suppose, 80000 cum(bank volume) of site [material density= 1800 kg/cum (loose)] is to 
be cleared using two dozers having semi-U blades and engine power 160 HP. Expected 
average haul distance is 50 m.
Step 1: For 160 HP dozer with semi-U blade and average haul distance 50 m, 
dozer maximum production (loose volume) under test conditions (from 
OEM’s chart) 
= 380 cum/hour
Step 2: Correction Factors (to be provided by OEM):
Operator Efficiency (assuming “excellent”) 
= 1.0
Material Type Correction Factor (assuming “hard to drift”) 
= 0.8
Operating Technique Correction Factor (assuming “slot dozing”)
= 1.2
Visibility Correction factor (assuming “clear”)  
= 1.0
Job Efficiency (assuming “50 working minutes per hour”)  
= 0.83
Grade Correction Factor (assuming “flat ground”)  
= 1.0
Material Density Correction Factor [assuming OEM’s dozer production 
chart prepared for test material with density 1370 kg/ cum(loose)] = 
1370÷1800  
= 0.76
Total Correction Factor = 1.0 x 0.8 x 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.83 x 1.0 x 0.76 
= 0.61
Step 3: Actual Estimated Dozer Production (loose volume) = 380 x 0.61 
= 230 cum/hour
Actual Estimated Dozer Production (bank volume) = 230 x 0.75 
(assuming load factor 0.75 for 50% rock, 50% earth condition of site)
= 172.5 cum/hour
Step 4: Number of Dozers 
= 2
Step 5: Assume, Number of working hours per day  
= 7.5
Step 6: Actual Estimated Production (bank volume) per day = 172.5 x 2 x 7.5
= 2587.5 cum/hour
Step 7: Number of Days required for 80,000 cum of site clearance work 
= 80000/2587.5 
= 31 days
Step 8: Assuming 25 working days in a month, time period required to complete 
the work = 31÷25 
= 1.24 months

Appendix – IX
DOZER OPERATION- DO’S AND DONT’S
	
I)	
Prior to dozer operation, work area to be checked for obstructions and hazards 
including ditches, slopes, hills, excavations, streams, and underground and 
above ground utility lines, overhead power lines etc.
	
ii)	
Proper traffic control to be ensured when operating dozer on a public 
thoroughfare or in an area close to vehicle traffic or obstructing it. Flaggers 
to be assigned wherever signs and barricades cannot control traffic.
	
iii)	
Never carry passengers on a dozer and stunt driving is prohibited.
	
iv)	
Do not operate a dozer with a leaking fuel system or leaking brake system.
	
v)	
Dozer to be operated only at speeds that allow maintaining control of the 
machine at all times.
	
vi)	
Dozer blades and attachments to be kept close to the ground while moving 
the machine.
	
vii)	
Dozer to be operated only from the sitting position, never from a standing 
position.
	
viii)	 Dozer to be parked on level ground whenever possible.
	
ix)	
Dozer to be equipped with an automatic back-up alarm that can be heard 
throughout the worksite.
	
x)	
Engine to be shut down during refueling of machine.
	
xi)	
Never use a dozer to demolish structures that are taller than the machine 
itself, unless there is adequate overhead protection.
	
xii)	
Proper procedures to be followed for dozer lockout, block out and tag out so 
that the machine is immobilized and secured against inadvertent movement 
at the time of machine service/repair/inspection.
	
xiii)	 Operator to use proper towing procedures and equipment for dozer 
attachments.
	
xiv)	 Extreme caution to be exercised, when operating dozer near the edge of a 
cut, to avoid overturning of machine.
	
xv)	 Steep incline should be climbed slowly.
	
xvi)	 Do not attempt a turn on a steep slope. Sliding sideways may turn dangerous 
if the low side of the dozer hits a solid rock or a stump.
	
xvii)	 Coupling of trailing equipment to a dozer should be done with extreme 
caution. Equipment should be coupled with the dozer stopped and the clutch, 
if so equipped, disengaged. Additionally, set the brake and lower the blade.

xviii)	When towing a heavy load downgrade, the dozer should be kept in low gear.
	
xix)	 Before dismounting a dozer and at the end of a workday, operator should 
secure the dozer blade by lowering it to the ground. Lowering the blade 
prevents the dozer from rolling and also eliminates the possibility of the blade 
falling on someone.
	
xx)	 Whenever it is necessary to work on the dozer with the blade up, especially 
when changing cutting edges, the blade must be securely blocked to prevent 
it from falling accidentally.
	
xxi)	 A dozer should never be used for clearing trees without being equipped with 
an operator’s protective cage (brush cage)
