Guidelines  for  Load  Testing  of  Bridges
(Special Publication 51)
1  Introduction
The B-8 Committee deliberated the revision of existing Guidelines IRC:SP-51 at a number of 
meetings and finalised the same at its meeting held on 21st June, 2014 at New Delhi. 
These Guidelines provide the procedure for full scale load testing of bridge super structure 
including recommendations for the acceptance criteria. The bridge load testing is considered 
as a routine requirement now a days not only in India but the world over, to meet the requirement 
of the designs, constructional quality of structure and  as an acceptance test conforming to the 
Codal provisions. The load test is carried out mainly to assess the flexural capacity, where in 
the required parameters can be measured directly and accurately. The super structures are 
rarely tested for shear strength evaluation due to absence of any reliable method. The load 
testing  envisaged  under IRC:SP:37 is only for assessing the strength evaluating the load 
carrying capacity for purposes of rating.  Whereas,  the load testing under these Guidelines 
is for assessing the behavior of a  bridge  by  application of design live loads over a longer 
period of 24 hours for confirmation of the elastic performance of the superstructure.

2  Scope
These Guidelines deal with Proof Load Test. They cover testing of superstructures, excluding 
arches for evaluation of their flexural capacity. Testing for shear capacity is not considered. 
This test is not intended to assess ultimate load carrying capacity of bridge superstructure.
3  Requirement  of  Load  Testing  and  Types  of  Load  Tests 
3.1	
General
Load testing of bridge components has been used as a tool for many purposes, such 
as a design tool, for verification of satisfactory performance, for new bridges to meet the 
acceptance criteria, identification of defects and subsequent repair, rating and posting of 
bridges, retrofitting to meet new requirements etc. Some of these are covered in more detail 
in Clause 3.2. The basic features of load testing of bridge superstructures are as follows:
	
1)	
The test is planned in such a way as to achieve the aims of testing
	
2)	
A component of the bridge which represents the superstructure, is selected 
for the test as required.
	
3)	
The test member shall represent either the normal type of element, or the 
defective (i.e. adversely affected) element due to presence of some known 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:51-2014
3
or suspected shortcomings. Known detailing errors, constructional defects, 
deterioration of steel connections, corrosion of reinforcement, inadequate 
strength of concrete are some of the examples of such shortcomings.
	
4)	
In the process of design and construction, safety and serviceability are aimed 
at by following the design codes and construction specifications. Of these, 
the ultimate strength of the bridge components cannot be tested for obvious 
reasons. However, serviceability performance can be tested using test loads 
at a level equal to the design service load, duly considering the aims of the 
test and procedural limitations.
	
5)	
The test load is applied in steps and the response of the structural element 
recorded using appropriate instruments. The type of response may be strains, 
rotations, deflections and vibrations.
	
6)	
The observed response is compared with the expected response. The 
expected response is calculated using more advanced analytical methods 
than those used in the normal design activity.
	
7)	
In all cases of load-testing, action effects of the loads of environmental 
origin, such as flood, normal wind and temperature effects are restricted 
to the unavoidable minimum. In case of temperature effects, temperature 
corrections are invariably made to the observed response to test load, 
measured in terms of strains and/or deformation.
	
8)	
As much information as possible is extracted from the test to decide further 
course of action.
3.2	
Purpose of Testing and Types of Tests
The type and details of the load test are decided by the purpose for which the test, or a series 
of tests, is planned. The purposes and types of test are briefly described below:
3.2.1	
Design Assisted by Testing
Testing may be carried out to assist the design in the following circumstances:
	
a)	
Where adequate analysis models are not available.
	
b)	
Where large number of similar components are used
	
c)	
To check assumptions made in the design
The method adopted for interpretation and use of test results shall be such as to confirm the 
requirements of the design.
For further guidance refer other relevant literature may be referred to.
3.2.2	
Proof Load Test
Proof Load Test shall be carried out as per Clause 4.1 on the Bridge or its constituent elements 
to demonstrate that the design intents are satisfactorily met by measuring the response 
thereof.



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 26
======================================================================
IRC:SP:51-2014
4
Testing of a superstructure span or part thereof, subjected to combination of self load, imposed 
loads and some percentage of live loads as specified can be carried out in accordance with 
the contract for procurement/construction, unless otherwise required in the contract. The 
detailed technical recommendations for this type of testing are covered in these Guidelines.
3.2.3	
Verification of Adequacy of Overall Structural Member or Part Thereof
The behavior test are carried out to verify the results for any method of analysis or design as 
in the following cases. The test load could be equal to or lower than the design load.
	
a)	
Where design model is not based on working loads, as in ‘Limit State Method’, 
design of some components and detailing of reinforcement is based only on 
the Ultimate Limit State (ULS).
	
b)	
In some cases the design model may not be sufficiently accurate, e.g. 
stresses around the openings.
	
c)	
The load path and load sharing between alternative load paths is too complex 
or uncertain, requiring its determination by testing.
3.2.4	
Diagnostic Load Tests
Where load transfer mechanisms have changed over the period of time due to geometrical 
changes (e.g. settlement of supports), deterioration, and repair/rehabilitation measures, it 
becomes necessary to verify the extent to which the load carrying capacity is affected, or the 
type of restoration measures required. Since the method and details of testing depend on the 
nature of change and its effects, the test has to be specifically designed to obtain the required 
information and data.
3.2.5	
Load Test for Rating and Posting of Bridges
Requirements of testing for these purposes are covered in IRC:SP:37. Unless otherwise 
stipulated, the details of the method shall generally follow the recommendations given in 
these ‘Guidelines’.
3.2.6	
Confirmatory Test After Repair/Rehabilitation
These tests are of the similar nature and purpose as Proof Load Test, Behaviour Test, or 
repetition of diagnostic test to measure the improvement after repair as described above.
3.2.7	
To Establish Stress Range for Fatigue Tests
In steel structures the member stresses are closely predictable. However the design and 
detailing of joints is based on ensuring adequacy on the basis of plastic redistribution, 
redundancy, over design, testing or combination of these strategies. Due to this approach, 
the exact level of stresses is unknown, and non-linear even for load levels for which the main 
structural members are in the elastic range. The effect of locked - in stresses is significant in 
welded connections, which have not been stress - relieved as a part of fabrication and after 
erection. For conducting fatigue load tests on such joints, the strain and stress range can be 
established by providing strain gauge at typical joints in the structure.

3.2.8	
Dynamic Load Tests
A new category of tests based on measuring the dynamic response of the structure as a 
whole or of some of its members is being increasingly used. The structural elements which 
are susceptible to damage due to dynamic loading are subjected to dynamic excitation 
and their response in terms of the frequency, amplitude, accelerations, etc. are measured. 
The response when plotted as a function of time during the test, using suitable recording 
instruments, produces dynamic signature of the member. These tests can be used for wind 
sensitive structures, such as suspension bridges, long span cable stayed bridges or only the 
cables.
For railway bridges the dynamic loading is often used, and can, in theory, be replicated for 
steel road bridges in suitable cases.
4  Expected  Behavior  of  Bridge  Components  During   
and  After  the  Load  Test 
4.1 
Design Intents of Newly Constructed Bridges and Retrofitted Bridges
1)	
A newly constructed bridge is load tested in order to verify or demonstrate that 
its behavior conforms with the design intents, when subjected to the combination 
of design values of permanent loads and design live loads. This is termed as the 
‘Proof load test’. The design loads and load combinations for the serviceability 
design verifications are defined in IRC:6. The combined action effects of permanent 
actions and vehicular/pedestrian live loads are simulated as closely as possible 
in the test by adopting suitable loading pattern, its magnitude, and method of 
application of the test-load. Some times the load testing is done to meet the 
requirements of the construction contract, for which purpose, specifications and 
method is pre-defined in the contact document.
2)	
Bridges which have been in service for some time are load tested for one of the 
following purposes:
	
a)	
In rare cases, before taking up the repair/rehabilitation measures, the 
behavior of bridge component in terms of stresses, deformations, vibrations 
etc are measured to observe and quantify their deficiencies.
	
b)	
To verify and demonstrate the efficacy of the repair/retrofitting measures. 
All cases, availability of the design calculations and constructional quality 
assurance data is necessary to establish the reference values of the 
performance. However, for the bridges that have been in service for some 
time, the constructional details might not have been preserved, and even 
locating the designs and drawings may not be possible. The inspection and 
maintenance records may give indications of the degree of deterioration. 
In such cases, re-establishing the design calculations on the basis of the 
codes existing at the time of its design is necessary (Refer IRC:SP:37).The 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:51-2014
6
main purpose of establishing this data is to calculate the expected response 
of the bridge/bridge components when subjected to the test load. This is a 
necessary pre-requisite for proper planning of the load test.
4.2 
Influence of Actual Material Properties
4.2.1	
Design Codes
In the design process, after conceptualizing the type of bridge for a particular site, the detailed 
design is carried out following the design Codes. IRC has carried out a major shift in design 
paradigm by adopting Limit State Design philosophy for steel composite and concrete bridges 
while revising respective codes. For planning of load test use of relevant Code is required.
4.2.2	
Design Properties of Materials
4.2.2.1	
General
The design is carried out assuming the basic engineering properties of the main constituents, 
namely, structural steel, concrete, reinforcing and prestressing steel, and components like 
bearings, as stipulated in the respective design Codes. The design of foundations and their 
behavior is also based on the soil properties, soil classification, experience and/or field and 
laboratory investigations. By necessity, the Codes give simplified descriptions of the material 
properties, termed as the ‘Design Properties’. The use of the ‘design properties’ of materials 
alone is, therefore, not adequate to understand and predict the response and compare the same 
to the actually measured response recorded during the load test. A deeper understanding of 
the variability of the properties is an important factor influencing the response at serviceability 
level of loads and are described in the following articles.
4.2.2.2	
Variability of compressive strength, tensile strengths and ‘E’ value of concrete
The design characteristic strength in MPa denotes the comprehensive strength of concrete. 
However the actual strength of concrete in structure under sustained load can be somewhat 
lower. 
	
a)	
Variation of Strength
	
	
The variation of strength after 28 days is not taken into account while 
designing new projects. However for the purpose of calculating the effective 
E value, strains and stresses for the load test, the gain in strength should 
be accounted for. This is especially valid for the testing of bridges which 
have been in service for some time. The provision given in IRC:112 shall be 
used for the purpose. For old bridges where the originally specified design 
strength is not available, the same shall be based on the cylindrical cores 
taken from the bridge components and tested as per IS:516. These shall be 
converted to the equivalent design strength using appropriate factors.
	
b)	
‘E’ Value to be Used;
	
	
The strains in concrete which develop at any section on loading of the 
structure are calculated on the basis of mathematical models, which are 
appropriate for the type of structure and loading under consideration.

c)	
Effect of Shrinkage;
	
	
Concrete shrinks in volume in the process of setting, and after setting, which 
changes its linear dimensions. This change is mainly associated with the 
loss of moisture from concrete and other factors, which are described briefly 
in IRC:112 and in the extensive literature on the subject. A small portion of 
shrinkage is recoverable, the rest being irreversible. The rate of shrinkage is 
different in different parts of the structural member due to different thickness 
and the gradient set up in the process of loosing moisture from the inner 
zones through the surfaces.
	
d)	
Effect of Creep;
	
	
The effect of creep should also be kept in mind, as the creep and recovery 
of creep are not identical, and affects partly the percentage of recovery after 
unloading.
	
e)	
Effects of Loading/Unloading and Creep Recovery in Prestressed 
Concrete;
	
i)	
The discussion about loading, unloading and creep presented in earlier 
sections is directly applicable to the reinforced concrete portions of the 
structure. However while applying these concepts to the prestressed 
concrete portions; a fundamental difference caused by the introduction 
of pre-compression in the structure has to be taken into account. It should 
be realized that introduction of prestress is equivalent to introduction of 
external load in the structure. IRC:112 has specifically treated prestress 
as an external load. The nature and action of this load is to introduce in 
the structure stresses of opposite sense than those created by service 
live loads. Thus, from the point of its effect on concrete, prestressing 
is the initial load, and the effect of the externally applied live load is to 
reduce, or reverse, these stresses caused by prestressing. Hence the 
action of applying test load is that of un-loading the concrete and removal 
of test load is an act of re-loading the concrete. The uses of effective 
E values while loading and un-loading are in the reverse order than 
the reinforced concrete portion. Same is true about the creep effects. 
Test loading of structure will lead to recovery of creep and removal of 
load will re-load concrete, putting back the creep phenomena on its 
original track. This should be properly accounted for while calculating 
the expected strain and deformation behavior during the test load.
	
ii)	
The other important factor, which leads to simplification of calculations, 
is absence of cracking of concrete in response to application of test load. 
Thus the full cross section over the entire length of the span remains in 
un-cracked condition, allowing use of the fixed values of the sectional 
properties. This makes the calculated response more accurate than the 
case of reinforced concrete elements.

4.2.3	
Reinforcing and Prestressing Steel
The properties of reinforcing and prestressing steel are better established since these are 
factory manufactured items, with further quality controls applied in their acceptance testing 
and use at site. Whereas the ‘E’ value is reliably known, the actual bond between reinforcing 
steel and concrete in an RC structure is variable.
4.2.4	
Structural Steel
The properties of the structural steel used in the construction of steel bridges and steel-
concrete composite bridges are known accurately. However, the effects of locked-in stresses 
due to the fabrication activities are not exactly known. Thus the initial state of strains and 
stresses may be uncertain, but the response to the test-load is expected to be in elastic 
range. The reason for observed deviations during load testing from the calculated strains and 
deformations are mostly due to the simplifications introduced in the analysis.
5  Structural  Modelling  and  Methods  of  Analysis
5.1	
General
The results of load tests are required to be compared with theoretical analysis. For proper 
comparison the theoretical analysis should be compatible with the realistic behavior of the 
structure. The structural geometry, material properties, support conditions and load effects 
should be considered in such a way that these reflect the true behavior of structure. For this 
purpose two types of approaches are available.
	
a)	
Theoretical analysis
	
b)	
Physical modelling
A brief of these two types of modelling is given hereunder.
5.2	
Theoretical Analysis
The behavior and response of the structure to various load effects is analysed using 
mathematical equations and physical laws. A number of analytical tools are available for 
analyzing the bridge structures utilizing the modern computing facilities. The choice of 
analytical tools depends on the following factors:
	
i)	
Purpose of structural analysis,
	
ii)	
Importance of structure and
	
iii)	
Desired level of response and accuracy.
A number of methods are used for analysis of structures viz:
	
a)	
Linear analysis/elastic analysis
	
b)	
Non linear analysis/Inelastic analysis
	
c)	
Static analysis

d)	
Equivalent static analysis
	
e)	
Non linear static analysis (pushover analysis)
	
f)	
Free vibration analysis
5.3	
Physical Modeling
Physical modelling is done to predict the behavior of the structure using a physical model in 
the laboratory which is of size much smaller than the prototype where the load effects can be 
applied and monitored in controlled conditions.
Some of the physical models could be of following types:
	
a)	
Global bridge models comprising of entire bridge with all frames and 
connecting structures
	
b)	
Tension and compression models
	
c)	
Frame models
	
d)	
Bent models
5.3.1	
The bridge models are generally made of PVC-N for deformable and of Celluloid 
for rigid case.
Model of reinforced cement concrete for RCC Bridge is also made for testing in laboratory. The 
size is proportioned in 1/20 to 1/15 scale. Concrete and steel used are of same proportion and 
strength as in prototype. Diameter of steel reinforcement is however reduced in proportion of 
size of structure model. Steel is to be got made by special order.
5.3.2	
Physical modelling and testing, also called experimental stress analysis are 
normally used for research to verify the analytical results, response of structure to assess the 
behavior of complex structures including connections, local areas.
6  Planning  of  Load  Testing
6.1	
Selection of Spans 
For existing bridges after study of records and detailed inspection, the critical span/spans for 
load test shall be decided.
6.2	
Flow Chart of Activities
A method statement shall be prepared which includes a detailed activity schedule for the load 
test as programmed for timely completion of load testing. The method statement shall have 
the following details for conducting the load test,
	
i)	
application of whitewash for critical locations of bridge
	
ii)	
mobilization of testing personnel to site
	
iii)	
visual inspection of bridge

Types of Load Tests
Static load tests are to be carried out to verify and ascertain the actual structural behavior 
of the bridge compared with theoretical designs. Dynamic load tests may be carried out 
for special structures where required. The primary objective of the load tests is to better 
understand bridge’s response to static and dynamic loadings.
6.3.1	
Static Load Testing
Static load testing is performed to measure vertical deformation of bridge at mid span or at 
any predetermined locations. Measurement of recovery of deflection and crack width will be 
part of static load testing. In special bridges like suspension and cable stayed, the measured 
and theoretical deflected shapes of the superstructure during and after the static load tests 
be also recorded.
6.3.2	
Dynamic Load Testing
The purpose of dynamic test is to verify the dynamic behavior of bridges and specialist 
literature may be referred for details of carrying out such tests.
6.4	
Methods of Loading
6.4.1	
The method of loading should be such as to either simulate the specific class of 
vehicle or induce in the member(s) the calculated forces, viz., the bending moments at critical 
sections,
The test loads shall be in the form of :

The load effect on a span can be produced by building up preweighed units on loading 
imprints spaced as per codal provisions. The imprints are built either with steel plates or 
brick masonry or concrete and rolled steel sections placed across pairs of imprints, so that 
platforms could be built on a group of four imprints for placement of preweighed units. The 
area of each platform depends on the magnitude of the load and unit weight of individual 
unit. A pre weighed unit normally comprises of sand or soil filled gunny bags, concrete cubes, 
bricks etc, which can be carried manually. Otherwise, large concrete blocks, containers of 
water or (stone) ballast or steel ingots could be used if mechanical handling facilities are 
available to load and unload them. The loads are placed eccentrically on the carriageway 
of a bridge in such a way that maximum bending moment is produced in any longitudinal 
member.
6.4.2.2	
Other types of static loads
Any configuration which produces the design forces (load effects) in the member(s) could 
be adopted, for instance uniformly distributed load. Any of the appropriate methods of load 
distribution between the griders can be adopted in arriving at the test load and its configuration 
on the span. But the method of distribution of loads should be the same as adopted in the 
approved design.
However, where the approved designs are not available the owner of the bridge should specify 
the appropriate method of load distribution. In the case of multiple girders, it is possible that 
the design moments are simultaneously induced in more than one girder. It may well happen 
that the magnitude of the test load on the span could be greater than that of the design IRC 
vehicle, however the forces induced in any member should not exceed the specified design 
force of the load test.
6.4.3	
Mobile Test Vehicles
Use of mobile test vehicles duplicating the axle loads for various classes of loadings should 
be preferred as compared to the use of equivalent static load which is difficult, time consuming 
and requires longer closure of traffic on the bridge. The advantage of using such mobile 
vehicles is that they can be quickly positioned in the exactly required locations. Also being 
rolling loads, all cross sections of superstructure are tested without having to workout special 
loading patterns to represent envelope diagrams of the span for bending and shear. In 
exceptional cases if commercial vehicles are used, the number and spacing of such vehicles 
need to be worked out, so as to produce equivalent B.M. and shear at critical sections on 
those due to the Standard IRC loading.

6.5.2	
Placement of Instruments
LVDT’s and/or dial gauges shall be fixed to magnetic stands. They shall be placed on firm 
scaffolding platforms with steel plates so that the magnetic stands are firmly located. Wherever 
dial gauges and analogue thermometers are used, the reading shall be recorded at height 
from the closest range possible to avoid parallax.
Glass plate of size 50 x 50 x 5 mm shall be fixed to the structure at the location of LVDT or 
Dial gauges. The spindle of LVDT/Dial gauge shall be in touch with the glass plate always 
while testing.
6.5.3	
Calibration of Instruments
All testing instruments shall be duly calibrated at accredited laboratories before start of the 
load testing.
The frequency of calibration of testing instruments shall not exceed the periods specified by 
the manufacturer or 1 year whichever is less.
6.6	
Mobilisation of Personnel and Testing Agencies
Only qualified technical personnel shall be engaged for bridge load testing. The testing 
Agency shall have satisfactorily completed at least five bridge load tests.
6.7	
Supervision and Quality Assurance
6.7.1	
The span under test shall be given a lime wash in order to identify formation of 
cracks during load test.
6.7.2	
Scaffolding system provided for instruments shall be independent and shall not 
come in contact with any bridge component or any part of scaffolding system erected for 
recording readings from instruments installed for the test span.
6.7.3	
Whenever spans are tested in urban limits, where pedestrian or vehicular traffic 
passes below, a safety scaffolding system shall be provided, as a safety measure. The 
scaffolding shall be able to take full load of test span in case of any eventuality.

6.8.3	
The structure shall not show any cracks more than 0.30 mm for (normal) moderate 
exposure and 0.20 mm for severe conditions of exposure, spalling or deflections which are 
incompatible with safety requirements, as prescribed in the relevant design codes.
6.8.4	
Structures which do not meet the above criteria shall be considered as non- 
compliant.
6.9	
Re-Testing after Strengthening Measures
6.9.1	
In case any bridge fails to perform in load test, a detailed analysis shall be carried 
out for non-compliance of load test commencing from designs, execution of work, quality 
control procedures adopted, existing reinforcements, existing strength characteristics of 
various structural elements, etc., and causes for non-conformity shall be identified. The 
details of required strengthening measures of such a structure be worked out for meeting 
the acceptance criteria and executed in order to restore the structure to its serviceable 
condition.
6.9.2	
Since one span or multiple spans of the bridge are representative samples of the 
whole bridge, when any single span fails to perform under load test, leading to its rejection, 
whole of the bridge shall be rehabilitated and not the test span alone.
6.9.3	
After satisfactory completion of rehabilitation exercise, of the whole bridge, load 
test shall be carried out for any randomly selected span, as per the method prescribed in 
Clause 5.4 and test repeated.
7  Conduct  of  Load  Test
7.1	
Preliminaries for Load Testing
7.1.1	
All preliminaries, like white wash to the underneath or/and for critical locations of 
test span, providing scaffolding system for instruments, scaffolding system for recording test 
measurements and safety scaffolding system shall be provided. Thereafter, loads shall be 
organized on the structure in any pre-approved form for completion of load test.
The testing agency shall prepare the required method statement and flow chart of activities, 
for smooth organization and completion of load test and for procuring calibrated instruments, 
their erection and fixing at appropriate locations, and recording all test measurements.
7.1.2	
Since the load test is a process involving working continuously for a number of 
days all personnel involved shall be alert and cautious, while load test is in progress. In case 
of excessive deflections, or strains beyond allowable limits, test shall be stopped forthwith 
the span off - loaded and certified accordingly.
7.1.3	
The test span shall be floodlit at night while test is in progress.
7.2	
Monitoring for Temperature Effects
7.2.1	
The deflection values and ambient temperature data are generally collected from 
dawn to dusk for two or three consecutive days at 1 hour intervals. The temperature vs. 



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 26
======================================================================

IRC:SP:51-2014
15
deflection data are collected on these days and a curve drawn for each station (dial gauge 
location), which is taken as the basic curve for temperature correction. The temperature - 
deflection characteristics will be a linear line drawn between points of minimum temperature 
- least deflection and maximum temperature most - deflection. The deflection reading at 
any location and temperature during load test is super-imposed on the basic curve. The 
difference between the two values gives the true deflection for the location under reference, 
corresponding to the same temperature.
7.3	
Main Load Test
7.3.1	
Before start of loading, theoretical deflection at critical locations of the span to be 
tested, shall be worked out, with design load.
7.3.2	
The test load shall be applied in stages, so that timely action, such as stopping 
the test, can be taken, if any untoward distress is observed at any stage. The dead load is 
already acting and the test load is usually a specified multiple of design live load more than 
one. The suggested stages of test load placement are 50 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent 
and 100 percent. These stages can be altered judiciously when loading is by vehicles. While 
loading the structure in stages, the next incremental loading should be added only after the 
deflections under the previous load have stabilized, which is normally about one hour, and 
this period is also called cooling time. Unloading should also be in the same stages as that 
of loading.
7.3.3	
The test span shall be constantly monitored for appearance and widening of cracks 
at every stage of loading. The entire span under test, i.e. underneath and all critical locations 
shall be flood lit for easy visibility of cracks or distress, during nights.
The load-deflection characteristics at every increment should normally be linear and any 
abnormal behavior will get reflected in the load vs deflection data. If the deflection observed 
exceeds the calculated theoretical deflections at any stage, further loading, shall be stopped 
and span shall be allowed to stabilize for longer durations. In some cases immediately 
after placing 100 percent load, deflections may exceed marginally compared to theoretical 
deflections and deflections will get retrieved less than theoretical deflections in a span of less 
than two-three hours. If it does not come down then the load shall be removed and placed again 
after 2 to 3 hours. Subsequent action shall be taken after consulting all concerned Engineers. 
Occasionally cracking sounds at the location of expansion joints are heard, when the rotation 
capacity is exceeded, particularly, in balanced cantilever bridges, spalling of delaminated 
concrete is also possible during load test, however same needs to be investigated before 
continuation of load test.
7.3.4	
The Pre-requisite for load test shall be as follows;
	
i)	
All visual defects shall be measured, mapped and plotted.
	
ii)	
Bearings shall be ensured for their functional condition.
	
iii)	
Expansion joints, gaps shall be ensured for their functional condition.

7.3.5	
The following precautions shall be taken
	
i)	
All stagings shall be stable and safe.
	
ii)	
Staging for instruments and that for observers shall be independent.
	
iii)	
Staging for the instruments shall be rigid.
	
iv)	
Wherever required depending on site condition a safety staging shall be 
erected in order to avoid any eventuality to traffic and/or pedestraian below 
the span under test.
	
v)	
Due to temperature variation, the superstructure will tend to hog or sag, 
therefore, it shall be ensured that, contact with the spindle of the LVDT/ 
dial gauges is not lost. Spindle extension shall be fixed to take care of this 
aspect.
7.3.6	
Loading and Unloading Procedure
7.3.6.1	
Loading operation stages from 0 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent to 
100 percent of test load shall be completed within 24 hours, similarly unloading operations 
from 100 percent, 90 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, 0 percent shall be completed within 
24 hours.
7.3.7	
After complete loading the structure for 100 percent of its test load, it shall be 
retained for 24 hours on the structure.
7.3.8	
The structure shall be off loaded immediately after 24 hours in the decremental 
stages of loading.
7.3.9	
After 24 hours of unloading of 100% load from the structure, all required 
measurements be recorded.

7.4.2	
Measurement of Response from Load Testing
7.4.2.1	
Deflection measurements shall be recorded through LVDT’s or dial gauges with

flow exists or head room is more than 6.0 m.
7.4.2.2	
Wherever deflection measuring instruments cannot be fixed from bottom of span 
due to water flow or due to very large head room, prisms of total station can be fixed to the 
bottom of girders or at any location in girder along critical section.
7.4.2.3	
A precision digital level can also be used to record deflection measurements from 
top of the superstructure. In such circumstances wearing coat shall be removed at measuring 
locations.
7.4.3
