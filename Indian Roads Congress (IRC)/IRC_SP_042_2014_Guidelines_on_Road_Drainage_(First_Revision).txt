GUIDELINES OF ROAD DRAINAGE
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
Adequate
drainage
is
a
primary
requirement
for
maintaining
the
structural
soundness and functional efficiency of a road. Pavement structure including subgrade must
be protected from any ingress of water; otherwise over a period of time
it may weaken the
subgrade by saturating
it and cause distress
in the pavement structure. That
is why rapid
dispersal of water from pavement and subgrade
is a basic consideration
in road design.
Also, proper drainage takes away the water from pavement surface quickly and reduces the
chance of skidding of vehicles. Because of inadequate surface and sub-surface drainage,
the structural stability of pavement is undermined by,
1)
Weakening of pavement structure and subgrade through infiltration of water
from the top, and
2)
Erosion
of shoulders, verges and embankment slopes caused by water
running off the pavement.
1.2
The detrimental effects of water in the pavement system are as under
i)
Water in the asphalt surface can lead to moisture damage, modulus reduction
and loss of tensile strength. Saturation can reduce the dry modulus of the
asphalt by as much as 30 percent or more
ii)
Added Moisture in unbound aggregate base and sub base is anticipated to
result in a loss of stiffness on the order of 50 percent or more
iii)
Modulus reductions of up to 30 percent can be expected for asphalt treated
base and increase erosion susceptibility of cement or lime treated base
iv)
Saturated fine grained roadbed soils could experience modulus reduction of
over 50 percent.
1 .3
The role of proper drainage to ensure longevity of pavement has been emphasized
in IRC:37 "Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements". Among the measures mentioned
therein, to guard against poorly drained conditions
is maintenance of transverse sections
in good camber to reasonable cross
fall so as to facilitate quick runoff of surface water
and provision of appropriate surface and sub-surface drains, where necessary. Some other
measures, such as extension of granular sub-base over the entire formation width, provision
of drainage layer, adequate height of formation level above HFL/ground level etc. are also
mentioned. Infiltration of water under the pavement through adjoining earthen shoulders (or
verges) and median is also a major cause of weakening of the pavement. Road design must
take this into account.
1



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 148
======================================================================
(RC:SP:42-2014
1.4
A road drainage system must
satisfy two main
criteria
if
it
is
to be
effective
throughout its design
life:
It must drain surface and subsurface water away from the roadway and dispose
it
in a way that prevents excessive
collection
of water
in unstable areas and
subsequent downstream erosion.
1.5
The design of drainage structures
is based on the sciences of hydrology and
hydraulics,
the former deals with the occurrence and formation
of water
in
the
natural
environment
(precipitation,
stream
flow,
seepage,
etc.)
while
the
latter deals
with
the
engineering aspects of liquid in motion.
1.6
If the water present in the surface course is not prevented from entering the road
pavement by means of impervious wearing and binder course or a completely impervious
bond coat, water will enter the road pavement from above and weaken
it, even to the extent
of resulting in pavement failure.
1.7
Despite measurers for quick drainage of pavement surface as well as provision
of fairly watertight surface, water enters from top through cracks and travels through various
pavement layers and gets accumulated at the surface of sub-base/base course and subgrade
causing considerable functional problems. While
in new road construction,
this aspect
is
usually taken care of by providing a drainage layer at this level,
in the existing boxed type
pavement construction, this is an acute problem and special measures need to be taken as
per actual site requirements for draining out the locked water.
1 .8
Also the road pavement itself must be constructed so that it will drain in the event of
a failure of the integrity of the surfacing layers,
i.e.
if water is able to enter the road pavement
there must be a path for
it to exit. The internal drainage function of a road pavement is usually
performed by the GSB and drainage layer, and this layer must be drained in some way.
1.9
A clear idea about internal drainage of a pavement structure and the mechanism
of failure on account of inadequate drainage
facilities
in a pavement system should be
understood and suitable remedial measures taken against
it to ensure desired performance
during the service life of the pavement.
1.10
Considering the importance of drainage, the Embankment, Ground Improvement
and Drainage Committee (H-4) of IRC in one of its meeting decided that separate guidelines
covering specific requirements for different situation such as rural (plain and rolling), hilly and
urban sections of roads and airfield pavement should be prepared. These guidelines on road
drainage are the first such guidelines on this subject in this country. They are applicable
in
non-urban (rural) road sections in plain and rolling terrain.
1.11
First
draft
of
IRC:SP:42 was
published
in
1994.
Considering
the
practical
problems faced
in road from many years due to drainage issues,
it was decided to revise
the
draft. As per the decision by H-4 Committee members during the meeting
held on
07.04.2012,
it was decided to constitute the Sub-group committee of experts
in the field of

2 SCOPE
These guidelines deal mainly with drainage of non-urban (rural section) roads running through
plain and rolling areas. The aspects covered are influence of surrounding topography and
geography, alignment and geometries of the road, transverse and
longitudinal drainage,
drainage of shoulders, verges and median (central verge),
internal drainage of pavement
structure, drainage of subgrade, drainage of high embankment, surface & subsurface drains
and cross drainage with ground water recharging. Examples of estimation of peak run off and
hydraulic design of surface drain are also given. However,
it may be noted that drainage of
urban roads (IRC:SP:50),
hill roads, airfield pavements and cross drainage structures have
been covered under, separate guidelines on these subjects. A new section on ground water
recharge from drainage has been added.

3 GENERAL CRITERIA
Highway construction is an engineering project with the objective of providing a uniform solid
surface (road) on which the vehicle can travel with safety and ease preferably in all weather
conditions. Water and traffic impact are the main causes of road failure or its distress.
In this code, the aspect of the highway design affected by water is dealt with. The general
term used for this is road drainage design.
3.1
Following are the important factors which are required to be kept in mind before
designing a drainage system for a road:
i)
Expected
traffic, importance and configuration of the road (2-lane/4-lane/
6-lane)
ii)
Sources of water which may reach the road from above, sides and below
iii)
Drainage catchment areas and existing drainage systems
iv)
Geology, hydrologic and hydro-geologic conditions
in the surrounding area
of the road
v)
Geometric characteristics of the road (alignment, profile and cross-section)
vi)
Presence of extreme gradients and cross slope, areas of excavation and
land
fill, probability of frost formation
vii)
Any limitations in and around the road which may affect the design of drainage
system
3.2
Reason for Damage to Road Pavement
i)
Due
to
hydraulic
pressure
of
water
inside
pavement
layers
or
subgrade
Once water has entered a road pavement, damage
is
initially caused by
hydraulic pressure,
i.e. vehicles passing over the road pavement impart
considerable sudden pressure on the water present in the road pavement.
This pressure forces the water further into the pavement matrix and breaks
it
up. This process can be very rapid once
it begins. Water that has entered the
pavement and is subject to the process of freezing (expansion) and thawing
during the winter also brings about the swift failure of the road pavement.
Eventually the water will descend to the subgrade layer below the pavement
courses and weaken
this
layer, and deep seated
failure of the road
will
begin.
ii)
Binder stripping in pavement layers due to water
Most aggregates have a greater affinity for water than they do for bitumen,
and with the presence of water and movement of the aggregate
it
is quite
possible for the binder film on the aggregate particle to be broken and water
to come
in contact with the aggregate surface. Once the
integrity of the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
binder layer has been broken
it will depend upon the chemical nature of the
aggregate particle and the viscosity of the binder as to how long
it will be
before stripping of the aggregate particles becomes an engineering problem.
Depending on the viscosity of the binder and the thickness of the binder film
surrounding the aggregate the stripping of the bitumen will occur hardly at
all, fairly slowly or quite quickly.
3.3
The selection of type of drain
to be constructed on a highway project section
depends on following situations:
i)
For highway in cutting
ii)
For highway in embankment
iii)
For highway with
hill on one side and valley/plain on the other side
3.4
Roads are Constructed with Two Types of Drainage Systems
i)
Surface Drainage
a)
Transverse drainage
It
is used to provide the continuity of natural water lines, intercepted
by the road.
It
is designed to avoid the flooding of the platform and
surrounding areas.
E.g. Aqueducts culvert construction and cross drainage structures
b)
Longitudinal drainage
Used
to gather and channelize the
precipitated water on the road
surface and from the side slopes and nearby land thus avoiding
its
access to the road surface.
E.g. Unlined and lined drains, kerb channel drain
ii)
Subsurface Drainage
It
is
very
important
to
release
water
trapped
inside
subgrade
and
pavement layers. This
is because soil resistance to compression may drop
substantially
if its moisture content increases. Increase
in moisture content
inside pavement beyond a limit (e.g. Liquid Limit) results in reduction of the
load carrying capacity of the road and premature failure and distress of the
pavement resulting in reduction in the design
life of the pavement.
The changes in moisture content in the subgrade and pavement layers occur
because of ingress of sub surface water, change
in water table, ingress of
water from top through cracks, leaked joints etc.
Following two types of sub surface drains are constructed to dispense trapped
water inside the subgrade and pavement layers:
a)
Longitudinal interception drains
b)
Longitudinal water table lowering drains

IRC:SP:42-2014
3.5
Alignment of the road can have a
vital
bearing on the problem
of drainage.
Therefore,
in case of new roads, surface drainage should be one of the criteria while fixing
the alignment. For example, locations parallel to large streams and running close to them
are likely to give rise to constant trouble besides the fact that several converging tributaries/
distributaries would be needed to be crossed. An ideal alignment should avoid steep and
heavy
cuts/fills as these situations have the
potential of throwing up piquant problem of
drainage and erosion control. Problems of these types are often prominent in rolling terrain
since alternate cuts and fills, unless designed with an eye on the smooth dispersal of surface
water, could play havoc with the natural drainage of the area and give
rise, among other
difficulties, to subterranean flow under and across the road.
In each case where cutting
is
involved meticulous care
is needed right at the start to anticipate the volume of water flow
so that necessary design measures to avoid instability of the road can be taken. No doubt,
surface drainage is just one among many other considerations in road location but
it warrants
careful attention.
3.6
Normally in plain areas road subgrade elevation in
fill sections is so fixed that the
top of the subgrade shall be at least 0.5 m above the original ground level - in non-flood area
as shown
in Fig„ 3.1. The bottom of the subgrade shall be 0.5 m to 1.00 m above the HFL
based on type of soil (Fig. 3.2). The HFL should be decided by intelligent inspections, local
observations, enquiries and studying the past records. Where
it is not possible to assess the
HFL,
it shall not be lower than the general ground level. IRC:SP:87 allows top of subgrade at
0.5 m above ground.

If a consolidated view
is taken,
there are three aspects
of surface drainage
design
in which the road engineer
is particularly interested. The
first concern
is with fast
dispersal of precipitation on the road surface so as to nriinimize danger to moving vehicles.
This
is achieved by proper geometric design of the road, e.g. by crowning the carriageway
or side cross fall, giving proper cross slope to the shoulders and verges, providing requisite
longitudinal gradient etc. Second requirement is that water from the road and the surrounding
area should be successfully intercepted and led away to natural outfalls. This is accomplished
by a system of suitable surface drains, shallow ditches by the side of the road (or catch water
drains on the hill slopes). Thirdly the engineer must build adequate cross drainage structures
at river crossings and minor streams.
3.8
Survey and investigations is a basic necessity for designing a system fulfilling the
above objectives. The work may involve:
i)
Preparation of alignment plan, longitudinal and cross sections and contour
map
ii)
Hydrological survey such as rainfall analysis and runoff estimation
iii)
High flood statistical information for the region
iv)
Hydraulic Design
v)
Geotechnical investigation
Recourse to remote sensing methods such as aerial photography and satellite remote sensing
may have to be made
if necessary facilities are available. The factors which may have a
bearing on road drainage such as rainfall, topography and natural drainage of the area, cross
fall and longitudinal profile, existing drains and CD works and internal drainage of pavement
layers etc. should be recorded.

4 SURFACE DRAINAGE
4.1
General
Drainage of pavement including
its adjoining areas
is an
important aspect of pavement
design. When a road
is constructed on a natural terrain, the waterways are intercepted and
hence necessary measures have to be taken to divert such water from road. Besides, water
on road surface received from rain and snowfall has to be disposed of as quickly as possible
to keep the road surface free from a sheet of water from safety considerations. Normally side-
ditches, lined drains, catch-drains and network of cross-drainage structures are provided as
part of the overall surface drainage system. This water received on surface of pavement,
medians and shoulders also seeps to lower layers through permeable pavement, cracks,
potholes, joints (in the case of concrete pavement) which needs to be got rid of for durability
of pavement. Such moisture
in the base and sub-base of pavement is disposed of through
subsurface drainage system which
is discussed in Chapter 5.
This section discusses primarily surface drainage of road pavement, shoulders, side slopes,
medians, rotaries, junctions, high embankments etc. Aflat pavement surface is not conducive
to flow of water and hence
it has to be suitably profiled to help quick disposal of precipitated
water. A thick film of water on a road surface
is a safety hazard as
it may result in loss of
contact between tyres and road surface due to formation of a wedge under tyres causing
skidding of vehicles. This phenomenon known as hydroplaning or aquaplaning is dangerous
when
vehicles
are
moving
at
high
speed.
Shown
in
Photo
4.1
is
a
typical
situation
where standing water on pavement surface
can
cause
hydroplaning.
Wheels
moving
partly on water and
partly on pavement can
cause instability
in moving vehicle especially
when pavements are kerbed. Danger is more
pronounced in such kerbed roads as
it creates
a 'bathtub' condition as seen in Fig. 4.1
. During
its design, proper camber must be provided to
drain the water expediently through kerb and
channel or mere kerbs with grated openings

4.2
Effect of Standing Water on Pavement
Consequence of standing water differs from pavement to pavement depending upon the
type of surfacing provided. Effects of water on flexible and
rigid pavements are discussed
separately.
i)
Flexible Pavement
Standing water remaining on bituminous pavement for a long period of time
is not desirable as
it tends to cause early deterioration of pavement.
It can
cause stripping of bitumen from aggregates especially when they are prone
to stripping
in case of some stones like granite, quartzite, quartz etc.
If the
bituminous mix
is open-graded or poorly compacted or surface has cracks/
potholes, the water seeps to lower layers and accelerates the process of
stripping. This water tends to migrate to lower layers of pavement and gets
entrapped
in granular base and sub-base layers.
If the base and sub-base
layers are not permeable enough to drain away this water laterally,
it results
in pavement resting on a waterbed leading to loss of aggregate to aggregate
contact thus reducing
load
dispersal
capacity and
eventually
leading
to
premature deterioration of pavement. Although bituminous pavement exhibits
good skid resistance but
it does not readily help in rapid disposal of surface
water. This is due to the surface tension and also due to pitted surface without
continuity as in the case of textured surface of cement concrete pavement.
A typical aged bituminous surface where a layer of water takes more time to
get cleared from road surface can be seen in Photo 4.2.
Photo 4.2 Texture of a Bituminous Pavement
ii)
Concrete Pavement
A well compacted concrete pavement as such
is generally impervious to
water and does not get affected by standing water. But joints, cracks and
shoulders permit moisture to seep through. For example a damaged joint
as seen
in Photo 4.3 permits moisture to infiltrate through. Moisture enters
through all joints including longitudinal joint formed with shoulder. Full depth

======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
cracks are another source through which water seeps under. Seeped water
in some cases
is ejected to the surface through joints under moving load
bringing out fine soil particles thus creating hollow pocket below pavement.
Photo 4.3 A Damaged Joint Groove can Permit Seepage of Water to Lower Layers
This phenomenon is called as "mud pumping". In due course pavement loses
support leading to corner cracks. Such moisture can also reach to lower
granular layers saturating them thus weakening them leading to premature
failure of pavement. Concrete pavement surface is textured for improving the
skid resistance and also for facilitating quick surface drainage through tiny
channels of texture. Tine and brush textures are the two types of textures
applied on concrete surface as shown
in Photos 4.4 and 4.5.
It has been
observed that tine texture is more durable than brush texture. Brush texture
tends to become bald faster. Tine texture can be applied
in both transverse
and longitudinal direction but a school of thought considers that tine texture
in transverse direction
is preferred to on account of
its better capacity to
drain surface water quickly vis-a-vis
in longitudinal direction although noise
pollution is said to be less in the latter case.

iii)
Granular/Earthen Surface
Standing water on granular or earthen surface is not desirable as
it seeps
to lower layers. Earthen surfaces become slushy making them unusable.
Cross-slope of shoulder provided should be steeper so that water can flow
expeditiously on
such
surfaces.
Requirement
of cross-slope
in
earthen
shoulder, therefore, always has to be more than the paved surface.
4.3
Factors Affecting the Surface Drainage of Pavements
For quick surface drainage
to take place the following features of pavement have to be
detailed suitably:
i)
Geometric features of pavement like longitudinal and transverse slopes
ii)
Kerbs and gutters/outlets provided
iii)
Type of surface
iv)
Texture of pavement
v)
Median drains in divided carriageways
vi)
Lane widths
4.4
Effect of Geometric Features of the Pavement
4.4.1
Longitudinal gradient of the pavement
With a view to facilitate quick removal of rain water, longitudinal profile of the road normally is
not designed flat. When the road is provided with kerbs as in the case of urban scenario, flat
surface can result in collection of large quantity of water on the road. To avoid this situation a
minimum longitudinal gradient of 0.3 percent is considered essential in most conditions.
4.4.2
Pavement cross-fall or cannber
By providing cross-fall or camber to the pavement, the runoff water gets cleared from the
surface rapidly. The cross-slope requirement differs for each pavement type. A mild cross-
slope
is sufficient in dense surfaces like bituminous concrete surface or concrete pavement
but open-graded bituminous surfaces and granular/earthen surfaces require relatively steeper
cross-slope for facilitating rapid flow. But steeper cross-slope in the case of granular/earthen
surface may lead to erosion of surface. The cross-slopes proposed for adoption
in Indian
Roads are given in Table 4.1.

Non-l<erbed pavement
Camber requirement varies depending upon the geometric configuration of a road. A few
cross-sections of roads are shown
in Figs. 4.2 to 4.6.
In the case of earthen shoulders,
the water flowing on surface
is guided away from the pavement including
in super elevated
sections as seen
in these Figs. 4.2 to 4.6. Normally earthen or granular shoulders are
provided with 0.5 percent more cross-slope than the paved surface as shown in Fig. 4.2.

There are situations where
in super elevated sections
in divided carriageway, provision of
single camber over entire width may be uneconomical due to increased earthwork. By having
staggered camber (Fig. 4.11), earth work can be economised and disposal of surface water
can be done quickly through central median.

4.4.4
Types of kerbs and inlets normally provided/embedded
A few standard kerb designs are shown in Figs. 4.12 to 4.14, which are used in urban areas,
in junctions etc. The
inlet design varies from place to place.
In some cases an opening
is
provided
in kerbs for this purpose. A PVC or HOPE pipe of 150 to 200 mm dia
is provided
to carry the water to side drain through
this
inlet. The
intlets are provided generally with
galvanised
grating
to block the entry of foreign
material. Two
typical designs of special
kerbs are shown
in
Figs. 4.15 and 4.16 for blocking entry of trash,
paper,
plastic bags
etc. Two designs of gully traps provided on pavement edge and on footpath are shown
in
Figs.
4.17 and
4.18.

as
a

it
is necessary
to

outlet pipe
in

in
Fig. 4.19 so that disposal of water
is faster. Two types of inlet provided
in kerb line can be
seen in Photos 4.6 and 4.7. Photo 4.8 shows horizontal grating.

Drainage of shoulders
Black topped
shoulders
are
durable and
help
in
quick
disposal
of surface
water.
For
economising cost of construction, shoulders are generally constructed with subgrade
soil
even on highways in India. As surface water cannot flow freely on earthen surface and camber
is enhanced from 2.5 percent to 3 percent in normal cross-section.
A few eroded earthen shoulders with rain cuts can be seen
in Photos 4.9 to 4.12.
Silt and
clayey soil are generally susceptible to erosion as seen
in Photos 4.9 and 4.10, whereas
good murrum/gravelly soil
is relatively less prone to erosion as seen in Photo 4.11. Earthen
or granular shoulders have to be periodically maintained by levelling and compacting to
avoid drop-off (depression
at road edge), erosion and consequential channelized flow of
water in longitudinal direction as seen in Photo 4.12. This operation involves adding of fresh
material to compensate for loss of soil due to erosion, vehicle movement etc. and compacting
the same after mixing necessary moisture to achieve MDD. Various treatments provided for
controlling surface erosion
is discussed in Para 4.4.7.

Treatment of batter
The longitudinal edge where shoulder and side slope join is known as batter. This junction is
highly vulnerable to erosion especially in the case of earthen or granular surfaces. This is the
most neglected part of road. Therefore, for reducing erosion, rounding the sharp corner and
compacting
it as shown in Fig. 4.20 is helpful. As normal roller cannot compact such location,
hand-held plate compactors can be employed for compacting. As a long range measure
it is
helpful
if a concrete kerb or brick-on-edge is placed all along the edge. Even when shoulder
is blacktopped as shown in Fig. 4.21, kerb provided at batter helps in controlling breaking of
edge.

Kerbed Shoulder to Control Erosion
Control of erosion of shoulder
Surfacing of shoulder
On account of cost considerations shoulders
in
India are constructed normally with earth
used
in subgrade. But
in the long run, earthen shoulders are expensive to maintain them
periodically.
In some National Highways part of the shoulders
is constructed with full-depth
pavement and in some cases thin black topping
is done.
In some States in India, part of the
shoulders are provided with brick-edging which not only protects shoulders but also gives
lateral support to the pavement edge thus increasing
its
life (Photo 4.13). Width of brick-
edging can vary from 0.3 m to entire width of shoulder depending on the availability of funds.
In urban limits use of concrete block pavement on shoulder lately
has become increasingly common (Photo 4.14). Construction of
thin bituminous layer on shoulder
is a good proposal
to control
erosion and drop-off. Depending on the susceptibility of the surface
to erosion suitable treatment has to be provided.

IRC:SP:42-2014
4.4. 7.2
Grade and level control
Erosion of shoulder surface especially the unpaved types can be controlled by maintaining
proper grade and level. Adequate camber has to be maintained at all the times as indicated
in Table 4.1. Besides, shoulder drop should not be allowed to occur as
it causes not only
damage to the shoulders runoff ability but also permits water to infiltrate into the pavement
through the shoulder edge.
4.4.7.3
Turfing
Turfing helps in controlling erosion of earthen shoulder provided
it is periodically trimmed and
kept clean. Normally due to lack of maintenance, the turf grows to
tall height and besides
decayed old grass raises the level and obstructs flow of water as seen
in Photo 4.15. Seen
in Photo 4.16
is a situation where cuts/trenches have been made
in the turfed shoulder to
drain surface water as turf itself was found obstructing flow of water. The turf seen
in the
above photos
is naturally grown and of wild variety. Some variety of grass which spreads
horizontally and does not obstruct flow of water must be selected for protection of shoulders
and not the wild variety. Use of a mini CC kerb or brick edging on batter helps
in keeping
shoulder edge intact (Fig. 4.21).

4. 4. 7. 4
Use of graded material
Provision of brick edging (as shown in Photo 4.15) at the junction of pavement and shoulder
will eliminate drop-off. Besides
it will help in protecting pavement from edges breaks. Width
of brick edging can vary from 0.3 m to entire width of shoulder depending on the availability
of funds.
4.4.8
Drainage of side slopes
Side slopes are again susceptible for erosion because of steeper slopes and higher velocity
of flow. This slope can be protected by providing
turfing with Sods/Seeding & Mulching/
Jute Netting/Coir Netting/Geo Netting etc. Guidance can be taken regarding erosion control
measures from Clause 307/308 of MORTH Specifications & IRC:56.

IRC:SP:42-2014
the slopes normally get covered with wild vegetation or grass. Although
it protects side slope
from erosion, but permits wild growth of vegetation and grass which are to be periodically
trimmed and maintained to make the area accessible for cleaning side d"'
3/ditches.
4.4.9
Drainage of high embankments
High embankments are vulnerable
to erosion
of side slopes on account water attaining
high velocity.
In such cases special arrangement like flumes/chutes are provided at regular
intervals so the water collected from the shoulder is channelized to these chutes or flumes.
An arrangement for collecting water and diverting
it to chute with special kerbs
is shown
in
Fig. 4.22. As water flows at high velocity through plain chutes with energy dissipater would
be required at the toe as shown
in Figs. 4.23 and 4.24. But stepped chute (Fig. 4.25)
is
preferable as
it is a self-energy-dissipating structure. The spacing of Chutes depends on the
intensity of precipitation, gradient and type of side slope surfacing etc. But generally a spacing
of 20 m C/C can be considered as reasonable as recommended
in IRC:SP:50. The plain
chutes are made either of semi-circular RCC pipes or in-situ/precast RCC sections as shown
in Fig. 4.24. They are set along the slopes on a concrete bed which should be anchored
intermittently to avoid sliding of chute. On both sides of the chutes stone pitching is normally
done over 1.0 m width. A filter bed, however,
is to be provided under pitching. The rest of
the slope
is normally covered with grass turfing or stone pitching as per the site condition.
Two-Dimensional/Three-dimensional erosion control mats or simple bio-engineering mats
like jute/coir can be spread for growing turf by using seeds as per Section 5 of IRC:56 and
Section 700 Clause 706 of MORTH. Selection of suitable erosion control mats shall be as per
the Table mentioned in MORTH Section 700.

concrete cantilever retaining walls are needed. This includes bridge abutments as well as
locations where conventional earthen embankments cannot be constructed due to right of
way restrictions.
A reinforced soil wall system consists of 3 components - A tensile element as reinforcement,
a facing unit as a confining unit and soil
fill. Prefabricated concrete units like concrete panels
or segmental blocks are the most common facia. There are many other possible facia types
like mechanically woven steel gabions, Steel woven wire mesh with welded panel as stiffener,
wrap around system with Geosynthetic elements or steel elements.
4. 4.10.1
Drainage for reinforced soil system-stability considerations
Uncontrolled subsurface water seepage can decrease stability and could ultimately result in
failure.
i)
Hydrostatic forces on the back of the reinforced zone will decrease stability
against sliding failure.
ii)
Uncontrolled seepage
into the reinforced zone
will increase the weight of
the reinforced mass and may decrease the shear strength of the soil, thus
decreasing stability.
iii)
Seepage of water through the reinforced zone can reduce pullout capacity of
the reinforcement at the face and increase soil weight, creating erosion and
sloughing problems.
As a precaution, drainage features should be included unless detailed analysis proves that
drainage is not required. Drains are typically placed at the rear of the reinforced soil zone to
control subsurface water seepage. Surface runoff should also be diverted at the top of the
slope to prevent
it from flowing over the face.
4.4.10.1.1 External drainage
a)
Drainage at the Top of the Wall or Slope
Considerable water percolation should not be allowed from the top surface
of any reinforced soil system. Provision for collection and channelization of
rain water should be provided. For walls which support roads on their
fill
side, a sealed kerb channel at the back of the paved shoulder/edge of the
carriageway should normally be sufficient. Where there is no hard shoulder,
a channel with flexibly sealed joints should be provided at the back of the
hard strip/edge of carriageway as shown in Fig. 4.26 (a & b).
For Part height walls, a drainage system should be provided at the top of
the facing behind the panel top or coping,
if used,
in order to remove water
running on the side slope. This may consist of simple drain channel leading
surface water along the wall top to discharge beyond the end of the wall as
illustrated in Fig. 4.27 (a & b).

Drainage of the Wall
In nnany cases the structural
fill
in a reinforced soil mass may be effective
as a drain without the use of other arrangements. However the free draining
characteristic
of the
fill
material need
to be
verified.
If the
structure
is
located on a permeable foundation
soil above the water table, any small
water seepage
will pass
into the foundation
soils and a drain
layer/pipe
might not be necessary. However
if the base soil
is not pervious enough, a
longitudinal porous or open jointed pipe of not less than 150 mm diameter
should be used to collect water and bring
it into the site drainage system
(Fig. 4.28 a & b).
To enable any seepage to pass through a hard facing, weep holes may be
located in selected panels. For discrete facings, the drain path may be easily
provided by omission of the vertical joint filler between
all panels at the foot
of the wall
in the embedded depth. A continuous drain at the base of the
structure may be required
in situations where capillary rise of deleterious
ground water might need to be prevented. The layer should connect with the
drainage system at the base of the structure.

4.4.10.1.2 Drainage of walls supporting cuttings
For locations, where water flow is expected from the retained soil, drainage trenches typically
300 mm thick and 1000 mm wide should be placed at intervals along the wall.
In case of significant water flows, a drainage blanket 300 mm thick may be constructed
below the reinforced soil wall and discharged beyond the toe.
If necessary, this blanket may
be continued up along the face of the temporary excavation for as high as is needed. As an
alternative, Geosynthetic drainage composite shall be used.
For cases where downhill discharge
is not possible, a toe collector pipe may be used. The
dimensions of the drainage trenches and blanket should be designed to suit the anticipated
conditions.
In
all cases the drainage
filter material should be designed
to avoid
loss of
reinforced
fill or adjacent soil into the drain.

Drainage of medians
Central medians are either raised or depressed as shown
in Photos 4.17 and 4.18. Both
such arrangements have their advantages and disadvantages as far as surface drainage
is concerned.
Earth
filling must be flush with kerb and with two-sided camber.
If turf
is
provided on the top there
is not much chance of too much water infiltering to lower layers
(Photo 4.17). But raised median
is said to be safety hazards as per experts. Depressed
median, although safer, may lead to seepage of water to lower pavement layers unless central
drain
is lined satisfactorily (Photo 4.19).
If water stagnates
in the median
it can seriously
impair the longevity of the pavement due to seeped water laterally below pavement layers.
Such provision must be avoided where black cotton soil is encountered. A poorly profiled and
maintained median with stagnating water can be seen in Photo 4.20. This water is bound to
infiltrate to pavement layers. When there is divided carriageway with a raised central median,
disposal of surface water of super elevated section requires elaborate arrangement. Water
can be diverted from one carriageway to other by having an opening/channel
in the median
as shown
in Photo 4.21. These are provided at 10 m to 20 m intervals depending upon the
intensity of rainfall, road width etc. When both the carriageways are at different levels, median
drains have to be provided as shown in Fig. 4.30. An open drain or a buried pipe provided for
collecting surface water can be disposed of at a nearby cross drainage structure. When pipes
are used, RCC manholes have to be provided to collect water from pavement surface. Some
alternate designs of median drainage arrangements are shown in Figs. 4.31 to 4.33.

Drainage of rotaries
Drainage of rotary requires special treatment as there
is super elevation on the inner curve
which forces water to collect at the central island. The surface water is collected and disposed
of through gullies placed inside or outside of kerb-line of central-island. One such arrangement
is shown
in Fig. 4.34 where there are gullies outside the central island for collecting and
disposal of water. A cross section of rotary is also given.
4.4.13
Drainage of intersections
Similar to rotaries, there are pockets at the edge of slip roads in intersections where water gets
accumulated on account of camber provided on all the merging roads. This water normally
has to be collected with the help of grated chambers as shown
in Fig. 4.35 and disposed
of.

Maintenance of Side Drains, IVIedians and Culverts
Maintenance of side-drains and medians is important for satisfactory performance and long
life of road.
4.5.1
Side-drains
Side drains along the rural highways are normally not lined due to cost considerations. But
when the roads pass through towns they are required to be lined. The maintenance of such
drains has been dealt in IRC:SP:50 entitled 'Guidelines on Urban Drainage'. Maintenance of
unlined drains especially prior to monsoon is essential. Depending upon the type of soil and
the rainfall intensity in the area, the drains get silted and clogged. Serious erosion of earthen
shoulder takes place in areas where silty soil
is encountered which normally clogs the side
drains.
In high rainfall areas, the growth of grass and vegetation in and around drain causes
obstruction to free flow of water and loss
in conveying capacity of drain. Ponding of water
in side drains due to blockage can adversely affect the areas through which drain passes
especially the performance of road
built on black cotton
soil
belt. Moisture can migrate to
clayey foundation of road leading to premature failure of pavement.
4.5.2
Medians
In divided carriageways the medians provided can be either raised with kerbs or depressed
type as shown in Photos 4.17 and 4.18 respectively. The raised medians on highways, filled
with earth, normally is cambered so that water from precipitation which is not soaked by soil-
fill flows on the road surface. But in the case of depressed medians chocking of water way
should be avoided as
it can cause ponding of water. This should be avoided both in the case
of unlined or lined drain.
4.5.3
Maintenance
As a policy, the drains and culverts have to be cleaned before and after the monsoon for their
satisfactory performance. As discussed in IRC:SP:50, the maintenance can be classified into
three categories:
i)
Continuous maintenance
ii)
Periodic maintenance
iii)
Special maintenance/repairs
Continuous maintenance involves inspection of side drains on regular basis and maintain
them by the Engineer in-charge of the road section.
Periodic maintenance can be taken up whenever the periodic maintenance of the road
is
taken up.
Special maintenance
will involve the repair of breached sections or improvements of the
waterway
if found inadequate.

5 SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE
Subsurface drainage is as important as surface drainage for long life and better performance
of pavement. The moisture which reaches lower layers of pavement from different sources
like pavement surface, seepage from shoulders, seepage from adjoining
hills and capillary
rise of moisture from ground
is termed as subsurface moisture. Disposal of this moisture
away from the pavement body is termed as subsurface drainage. Consequences of lack of
effective subsurface drainage system results in premature failure of pavement with formation
of cracks, settlement, rutting and boggy action in the case of bituminous pavement whereas
formation of crack, fragmentation and settlement of slab
in the case of cement concrete
slabs. Moisture reaching lower layers from pavement surface is dealt separately from that of
capillary rise of moisture from shallow water table. IRC:34 entitled 'Recommendations for Road
Construction
in Waterlogged Areas' has dealt this subject in details. The recommendations
have been discussed briefly in Para 5.4.
5.1
Sources from which Water/Moisture Reaches Lower Layers of Pavement
i)
From poor quality bituminous mixes which are permeable
ii)
From the cracks, potholes and joints
iii)
From the failed joint seals of cement concrete pavement
iv)
Through the longitudinal joint between pavement and shoulder
v)
From earth filled medians and shoulders
vi)
Seepage water from the adjoining high ground
in the cut sections of hilly
terrain
or from impounded water
level
higher than the road
level
in the
abutting agriculture fields (e.g. Paddy fields)
vii)
From capillary rise of moisture when water-table is high.
5.1.1
Ingress of water from top of pavement and shoulders
Cracked and potholed, porous and open graded bituminous layers and joints
in concrete
pavements, shoulders and medians are primary sources from where moisture seeps
to
lower layers of pavement. This has been shown schematically
in Fig. 5.1. Typical cracked
bituminous and concrete slabs shown
in Photos
5.1 and 5.2
readily permit moisture to
enter to lower layers. In extreme situation the quantum of moisture infiltrating to lower layers
through porous and poor quality bituminous mixes in pavement exposed near the edge can
be seen
in Photo 5.3. Pavement edge too is one of the primary sources of water infiltration
to lower layers. Two such longitudinal joints with wide openings can be seen
in Photos 5.4
and 5.5. Collected water in median is another source from where moisture infiltrates to lower
layers of pavement (Photo 4.20). For reducing the infiltration of water to lower layers from
median, the earth
fill should be profiled with camber so that part of the water is allowed to
flow towards road.

5.1.2
Seepage from hills
Seepage from
hill sides in cut sections
is a source from where embankment, subgrade, and
base/sub-base get soaked. This has been shown schematically in Fig. 5.2.
Roads are often damaged in stretches where there is excessive seepage from hills in absence
of adequate sub-surface drainage. Further details of surface and sub-surface drainage are
available in
Hill Road Manual (IRC:SP:48).
5.1.3
Capillary action
Some soils like silt, clay, fine sand, chalk and pulverised fly ash (PFA) which are susceptible to
formation of capillary tubes, through which moisture migrates upwards due to surface tension
when water table is high. This is shown schematically in Fig. 5.2. The effect of saturation of
lower layers of pavement due to above causes has to be prevented to protect the pavement
from premature failure. This issue has been explained in Para 5.2.4.

Effect of infiltration, seepage and capillary moisture on pavement layers
Trapped moisture from all sources in the pavement layers reduces the load taking capacity of
the structure thus causing loss of strength leading to premature cracks, rutting, potholes etc.
A soaked subgrade does not affect the strength or GBR as pavements are designed based
on soaked GBR of subgrade. But loss of aggregate to aggregate contact is a primary factor
for loss of strength. And sometimes the pavement exhibits 'boggy action'
i.e. the pavement
39



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
behaves
like a spring when moisture
is trapped
in foundation. Under the load, pavement
undergoes large deflection because of dispersal of moisture locally and after the release of
load,
it bounces back leading to reversal of stress/strain causing premature cracks due to
fatigue. Such phenomenon
is predominantly observed in clayey and silty soils.
5.2
Treatment of Subsurface Moisture
5.2.1
Drainage of infiltrated moisture from pavement and sfioulder surface
Subsurface moisture which
infiltrates from the pavement surface or shoulders has to be
drained out to avoid
loss of aggregate to aggregate contact so that load transference
is
not affected. An upper granular sub-base layer called as Drainage Layer (DL) has been
suggested to drain this trapped water lately by both MORTH Specifications and IRC:37. The
drainage layer
is part of a pavement structure which
is considered to perform the function
of both structural as well as a drainage layer. GSB layer can be constructed
in two layers
such that one layer can serve the purpose of Drainage Layer (DL) and the other layer can
serve as Granular Sub-Base (GSB). The basic ingredients of both mixes are same but the
difference
lies
in percentage of fines passing
in Drainage Layer and GSB mix. Regarding
relative placement of DL and GSB layer, both MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge
Works, 201 3 and IRC:37 have suggested that DL to be placed above GSB layer as explained
below:
1)
MORTH Specifications, 2013 has specified
six grading for Granular Sub-
Base (GSB). But out of that Grading
III and IV have been proposed for use as
lower sub-base and Grading V and VI for using as sub-base-cum-Drainage
Layer, (as given in Table 5.1)
ii)
Similarly
IRC:37
in
Para
7.2.1.3
states
that
the
sub-base
should
be
composed of two layers, the lower layer forms the separation/filter layer to
prevent intrusion of subgrade soil into the pavement and upper GSB forms
the drainage layer to drain any water that may enter through surface cracks.
The drainage layer should be tested for permeability and gradation may be
altered to ensure the required permeability.
Filter and drainage layers can
be designed as per IRC:SP:42 and IRC:SP:50. Six gradings suggested by
IRC:37 in Annexure V are extracts of AASHTO gradings (1993). Coefficient
of permeability
'k', of each grading has been given for all six gradings given
in Annexure
V, Grading-2 mix
(as given
in Table
5.2) has
coefficient of
permeability
'k' of 35 m/day is best suited for drainage layer.
iii)
The basic reasoning for providing drainage layer
is to dispose of seeped
moisture due to gravity from upper layers of pavement
in
lateral direction
as quickly as possible instead of allowing
it to seep down to lower layers as
shown
in Fig. 5.3. Without a intercepting free-draining drainage layer (DL),
water has a tendency to migrate downwards due to gravity.
If a dense GSB
layer provided below drainage of low permeability,
it
is helpful for forcing
moisture to flow laterally rather than moving towards downwardly direction.
Moisture must not be allowed to accumulate
in base and sub-base layers
as
it can lead to loss of aggregate to aggregate contact essential for load
dispersal to lower layers.

iv)
No research has been done in India on this crucial subject except some work
done
in
NT, Chennai. Considerable studies have been carried out
in USA
both
in Laboratory and
field on this subject. Two types of drainage layers
have been tried by advance countries,
i.e.
i) free-draining-sub-bases and
ii) open-graded sub-bases called permeable sub-bases. They have preferred
free-draining sub-bases rather than open-graded sub-bases because of its
more durable, more stable nature having permeability
k, of 15 to 45 m/day
in laboratory tests. The open-graded sub-base having k of 1 50 to 31 5 m/day
has high degree of voids and has lower stability. Such material was said to
have resulted in a layer where
it was like paving on marbles. Based on these
considerations the grading for the drainage layer having permeability k of
15 to 45 m/day is best suited.

In

between two Geosynthetic layers) can also be provided (Fig. 5.4) wherever
it proves to be
cost effective and technically meeting the requirements. The Geotextile will act as a separator
and filter also. Drainage composite specifications shall be adopted as per MORTH 704.2 or
IRC:34, 4.6.2.
Fig. 5.4 A Pavement Section Showing Day Lighted Drainage Layer (Drainage Composite)
When this drainage and GSB layers are day-lighted i.e. extended up to side slopes, the coarse
aggregates in mix tend to get dislodged and roll down from side slope affecting slope stability.
To have a stable permeable edge, 0.5 m wide
strip of both layers have been suggested
in IRC:37 for treating with either 2.5 percent of bituminous emulsion or 2 percent cement.
Use of bitumen emulsion or cement will have implication on cost of project and has to be
introduced with caution. An arrangement of constructing such a stabilised strip of drainage
layer along with a strip of GSB layer is illustrated in Fig. 5.5. When there is a lined side drain,
PVC or HDPE pipes can be provided at regular interval to drain moisture from DL and GSB
layers as shown in Fig. 5.6.

Alternate sub surface drainage system
Shown
in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8 are cross sections of flexible and
rigid pavements showing
French Drains where subsurface drain
is terminated under the shoulder. Durable crushed
aggregates are used as backfill material around partially perforated PVC or HDPE pipe. The
grading of backfill aggregates is given in Clause 309.3 of MORTH Specifications. One of the
filter materials suggested in Table 309-3 can be adopted. Normally a partially perforated PVC
or HDPE Pipe is buried near the bottom to collect and dispose of the moisture collected. While
selecting the geosynthetic filter fabric,
it shall satisfy filter criteria taking into consideration
the properties of soil around
it. Clause 702 of MORTH Specifications on geosynthetic filter
gives the details. Fin drain can also be provided at the junction of pavement and shoulder for
collection of water and disposing
it off as shown in Fig. 5.9. The fin drain consists of synthetic
polymer core wrapped by geosynthetic filter. Because of larger area of fin, more quantity of
water can be drained through
it. A perforated pipe as shown
in Fig. 5.14
is used to collect
water and dispose
it off.

5.2.4
Management of seepage moisture from fiilis in cut sections
There are two situations where seepage moisture affects the performance of road.
In the
first case when a road
is close to a nallah or a channel and the HFL is high, the seepage
water can
lead
to saturation
of foundation
layers
of pavement leading
to boggy action
44



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
especially when there is clayey and silty soil. The other situation is when the road alignment
passes through the cut section in a hilly terrain where there is cultivation on
hill tops. In both
situations intercepting seepage lines and disposing of moisture through subsurface drain
is
an appropriate solution.
5.2.5
Seepage from an adjoining nallali or ctiannel
This condition can lead to premature failure of pavement and may even exhibit boggy action.
Solution to such situation rests by raising the road level so that side drains can intercept
seepage of moisture from sides thus protecting road foundation. Introducing sand layer below
subgrade or replacing
it partly with sand sometimes helps in controlling the premature failure
of road and boggy action.
5.2.6
Seepage from an adjoining hill in cut sections
Seepage water is a serious problem in cut sections of hilly terrain especially when there are
farms uphill. During monsoon the problem further gets aggravated. Photos 5.6 and 5.7 give
an idea about the extent of seepage which takes place even
in dry season. The quantum
of seepage water collected
in a side ditch of road
in typical
hilly terrain can be seen from
Photo 5.7. A cross-section of a road
in
hilly section
is shown schematically

by providing suitable lined drains as shown
in Fig. 5.10. The details of such drains
in cut
sections have been discussed
in Section
8.
If there are stone or precast concrete kerbs,
openings have to be provided for water to flow towards side drain as shown in Fig. 5.10.

5.2.7.2
Disposal of surface water from hills
Surface runoff from hills should be intercepted due to following reasons:
i)
Water can carry considerable quantity of soil and muck from
hill and choke
the side-drains of road making
it ineffective.
ii)
The runoff water may seep into the hilly terrain and trigger landslides.
iii)
Surface runoff flowing at high velocity may cause severe erosion unless
it is
intercepted.
Depending upon the type of soil and area of the
hill top, a couple of catch drains may have
to be provided parallel to each other. A typical cross-section of cut and
fill area
is shown
in
Fig. 5.11 showing a catch drain, lined side-drain and a retaining wall.
5.2.8
Details of subsurface drain for intercepting seepage water in hilly terrain
Intercepting seepage moisture
in cut-sections
in
hilly terrain can be done
effectively by
installing French drains as shown
in Fig. 5.11 at an appropriate depth to intercept seepage
water reaching subgrade and lower layers. Normally the subsurface drain
is extended up
to hard strata as shown Fig. 5.10.
In plain terrain subsurface drain can be provided on
hill
side from where seepage is likely to take place. Whereas when there are hills on both sides,
subsurface drain can be provided on both sides. But when there
is a steep longitudinal
gradient
in cut sections, there
is a chance of water seeping from higher ground along the
middle of carriageway, and hence
it is desirable to intercept transverse or diagonal drains as
shown
in Figs. 5.12 and 5.13. The cross-sectional details of longitudinal subsurface drain
are given in Fig. 5.14.
It is a French drain comprising of a perforated HDPE/PVC pipe buried
in graded aggregates. The subsurface drain shall be constructed as per Clause 300.9 of
MORTH Specifications gives details of subsurface drain. Graded aggregates when placed

filter fabric
is used for wrapping the aggregate to function as separation and
filter medium
as shown in Fig. 5.14. Some details of aggregates, synthetic geo-filter, perforated pipe and
sand required for this work are explained
in Clause 300.9 of MORTH Specifications. Geo-
filter shall conform to Clause 702 of MORTH Specifications.

Sinking of hill road due to seepage of water underneatti the road
Where sinking phenomenon of road
is noticed
in
hills, depressing the side-drain toward the
hill and providing RCC Lining
is one of the solutions. Water should not be permitted to seep
under the pavement layers.
If necessary a couple of more cross-drainage structures should
be constructed at such locations.
5.2.10
RCC box drain to serve as surface cum sub-surface drain
It
is possible to combine both surface and subsurface drains with the help of a RCC Box
section as shown
in Fig. 5.15. The drain
will have grated openings for collecting surface
runoff from pavement and at the same time
it can intercept subsurface water like seepage
water from
cut section
in
hilly
terrain
through
well designed weep-holes as shown
in
Fig. 5.15.
5.2.11
Use of RCC pipe for the purpose of side-drain to dispose of surface water
In a kerbed pavement use of RCC pipe (preferably NP-3 pipes) can be used for the purpose
of surface drainage as shown in Fig. 5.16. Manholes shall be constructed at a spacing of 10
to 20 m as per the requirement of site condition so that the water collected at the edges
is
disposed from the opening provided in kerbs.

Treatment of Capillary Rise of Water
Locations where water-table or high flood level
is too high,
it is likely to affect subgrade and
embankment and weaken them and hence the IRC:37 recommends that road level should
be maintained such that the water table or high flood level should be such that the bottom of
subgrade should have a free board of not less than 0.6-1 .0 m above design HFL.
If increasing
of road level
is difficult or due to financial implication, a capillary cut-off should be provided.
This has been discussed
in IRC:34 entitled 'Recommendations for Road Construction
in
49



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
Waterlogged Areas'. Capillary cut-off suggested
in IRC:34 consist of sand blanket, HOPE
sheets, drainage composite
etc. as explained
in Section
7. A cushion of 10-15 cm thick
layer of sand or granular material
is required to be provided over the capillary cut-off layer.
Consequence of not providing capillary cut-off leads to the 'boggy action'
i.e. spring action
which
is common
in roads near canals and nallahs especially where soil
is predominantly
silty or clayey.
In the absence of a cut-off layer the pavement fails prematurely with cracks,
rutting and potholes etc.

suggested in the IRC:34, a bituminous primer may be applied before the blanket is placed.
It
is helpful
if the sand layer is moistened and compacted before placing upper layers.

Retrofitting of subsurface drainage system
5.3.2.1
Subsurface drainage arrangement
There are situations where old roads are found getting distressed due to lack of subsurface
drainage system. Where
the
longitudinal
joints
with
shoulder has widened
as seen
in
Photo 5.4 there will be requirement of retrofitting subsurface drainage system or providing
bituminous or concrete shoulder which can be sealed.
It does not help
if the opened joint
is filled with fresh
soil or granular mix.
In such cases construction of subsurface drainage
system as shown in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8 will be helpful.
5.3.2.2
Aggregate drains
After completion of a pavement without subsurface drainage arrangement,
if subsurface
moisture
is
trapped
in
granular base and
sub-bases,
aggregate
drains
suggested
in
Clause 309.3.7 of MORTH Specifications can be provided as shown in Fig. 5.1 8. Two types of
arrangements can be provided; one with longitudinal drain along the road edge with laterally
drains at regular intervals of 5 to
1 0 m as per site conditions. The minimum width of drain can
be 300 mm and should be provided up to the depth of granular layers. Such drain can perform
without getting chocked
if the aggregates are wrapped with geofilter fabric. The grading of
aggregates to be used in drain is given in Table 5.3 (Table 300-4 of MORTH Specifications).
The grading however is as under:

6 HYDROLOGICAL DESIGN OF ROADSIDE DRAINS
6.1
General
Hydrological design
of road drainage system
is the study and analyses
of the
physical
characteristics
of
catchment,
intensity-duration
characteristics
of
rainfall
of
different
frequencies to arrive at a suitable method of predicting design (peak) flood and corresponding
HFL.
It is a very important step prior to the hydraulic design of road drainage system. Such
analysis is necessary to determine the magnitude of flow and the duration for which
it would
last.
It includes the analysis of size and shape of catchment area, topography,
land use
characteristics,
natural storage,
soil type,
soil cover, drainage pattern,
rainfall
intensity of
the area, time of concentration and the flood peak. Highway drainage facilities range from
very small road side drains and culverts to large drain systems comprising minor and major
bridges. Roadside drains, though a minor component in terms of cost ensures conveyance
of runoff to the outlet points, thus ensuring safety of road embankment and paved surface of
road as well.
A longitudinal stretch of a roadside drain originates at a ridge point of natural ground along the
proposed alignment of road and ends at a predetermined outfall, be
it a proposed culvert or
an existing stream. A longitudinal profile of the existing ground on either side of the proposed
road alignment should, therefore, be available with the designer for demarcating the existing
primary and secondary ridges and
valley points
(outfalls). The
longitudinal
profile when
studied with the cross slopes of the ground (within ROW for which sufficient survey details
need to be available for easy generation of ground level contours) and presence of nearby
outfall streams/water bodies
if any, would surely bring out the intermittent stretches where
longitudinal toe drain may not be required (for carrying runoff from adjacent land).
Upon identification of the ridge and valley points, the lengths of different stretches of roadside
drains are determined. With increase
in
length, the corresponding design discharge and
consequently the section of drain go on increasing. Based on the length of stretches (and
other general hydro-meteorological/catchment criteria), the designer develops a preliminary
idea as to where an intermediate outlet structure (balancing culvert) is to be planned,
if at all,
so that the length of drain can be reduced and the drain can be designed with a reasonable
shape and size.
6.2
Data Requirement and its Source
The data required for the hydrological design include point value and intensity of rainfall of
the area concerned, the catchment area characteristics viz. soil type, vegetation cover, land
use pattern.
6.2.1
Rainfall
The
rainfall records of ordinary rain Gauge/Self-Recording Rain Gauge (SRRG) stations
are generally available with the
India Meteorological Department (IMD). Again,
rainfall
is
measured and records are kept by the State Irrigation PWD Departments for selected areas
and zones of their interests. Point values of Daily Maximum Rainfall for different frequencies
53



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
are available from Isopluvial maps annexed with the Flood Estimation Reports (for different
subzones) of Central Water Commission, prepared
jointly by CWC,
IMD, MORT&H and
RDSO. These point values of daily maximum
rainfall are useful
for estimation of rainfall
intensities.
However,
it is desirable to collect rainfall data from self-recording gauges, wherever available,
and analyze the same to derive Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves.
6.2.2
Soil type, vegetation cover and land use
Response of a catchment (runoff) depends primarily on physical characteristics
like slope,
soil type, vegetation cover, land use pattern and shape of the catchment. Soil type is a major
factor as erosion of soil may lead to gradual widening of unlined roadside drain eventually
inviting unwarranted risk for the road section.
The
soil
type,
vegetation cover
is
best ascertained from
visual
inspection
(as
effective
catchment areas for roadside drains are very small), information on crop produced
(in rural
section) and enquiry,
particularly from farmers/local people. Ongoing excavation works or
nearby canals
in cutting,
if any, may also indicate the type of soil of the catchment area.
Geotechnical investigation results for the proposed bridges (of same road project) will provide
the designer with vital information regarding soil characteristics. The Flood Estimation Reports
of CWC also throws some light on the soil type of the sub zones concerned. This information,
studied with available Soil Maps of India (NBSS & LUP) of the area concerned, shall guide
the designer about classifying the soil type of different stretches of the proposed road.
Information on the land use pattern of the area may be obtained from the offices of Urban
Development Departments.
Data on soil type, vegetation cover can also be gathered from processing of available satellite
imageries of the area (and of different seasons of a year), which could be procured from
National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad.
6.3
Factors Affecting Runoff
6.3.1
Design rainfall
Rainfall is the most important factor affecting runoff from a given catchment. Therefore, error
in estimating design rainfall results in major inaccuracy in estimated flood peak. Depending on
the methods used for estimation of peak runoff, design rainfall is used basically in two forms
viz.
i) point rainfall or
ii) rainfall intensity corresponding to design duration and frequency.
Point Value of Rainfall
A representative point value of rainfall, corresponding to design frequency,
is used
in some
methods of estimation. The point values can be reasonably estimated from the following:
i)
Analysis
of relevant
rainfall
series
collected from IMD
(Daily Maximum
values)
ii)
Analysis
of point
rainfall values
collected from
Isopluvial maps annexed
with the Flood Estimation Reports of CWC (Daily Maximum or of Shorter
Duration).
54



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
For both of the above sources, updated series or data should be used for estimation of
rainfall value of requisite Return Period.
Areal Spread Factor
The areal spread factor
is conversion of point
rainfall values to areal
rainfall values. The
rainfall occurred in a watershed is not same over the whole watershed.
It may be low in a part
of watershed and high in other part of watershed and therefore, this should affect the runoff. In
order to obtain areal average values for an area, hydrologists/design engineers should adopt
a suitable value to convert point rainfall amounts average rainfall amounts over a specified
area. The Fig. 6.1 represents the relation between the spread factor and catchment area.

Shorter Duration Storm
The design duration shall be taken equal to the time of concentration. For roadside drains,
the time of concentration is generally of the order of 5,
1 0,
1 5, 20, 30 or 40 minutes and
it is a
general practice in India to collect and measure accumulated rainfall and record values once
or twice
in 24 hours.
It
is, therefore, necessary to apply certain conversion factors to daily
maximum (or
1 2 hour maximum) point rainfall values in order to obtain the intensity of rainfall
for the desired shorter durations.
The conversion factors for getting values of up to
1 hour duration for different sub zones of
India are given
in the Flood Estimation Reports of CWC. The steps indicated
in IRC:SP:50
may be used to obtain shorter duration
rainfall from a continuous record of any particular
storm recorded
in the station. Using any suitable power relation (generally
fits best), the
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve can be generated for an area. However, due to
scarcity of recording type rain gauges, shorter duration (less than
1 hour) rainfall is difficult to
be estimated and the hydrologist shall judiciously adopt a rainfall value either by reasonable
interpolation
or depending on
his expehence
in
rainfall
distribution
pattern
of the area
concerned.
Tables 6.1 and 6.2 correlating the intensities of rainfall of shorter durations compared to
those of 60 minutes and 24 hours were determined for Lower Gangetic Basin (comprising of
part of Bengal and Bihar). The values for other areas might be different.

The size of roadside drain depends, apart from other hydraulic parameters, on the volume
and peak runoff (discharge) from a catchment which,
in turn, depends on the rainfall. Other
hydraulic parameters remaining unaltered, the proposed size and consequently, the cost of
drain go on increasing when the frequency of design flood becomes rarer or in other words
the estimated peak value increases. The size and cost of drain
is, therefore, required to be
optimized by designing
it under a presumed hydro-meteorological circumstances
i.e. for a
given
rainfall (chosen Return Period) or the design
rainfall and the consequent estimated
flood discharge or the design flood.
The choice of a design return period is based on an economic evaluation in which the costs of
providing the drainage works are compared with the benefits derived. However, comprehensive
local flood damage data are normally not available to the degree of precision required for
cost-benefit analysis. For this reason, a general policy decision based on the location where
the drains are going to be constructed, probable damage that might be caused due to failure
of drains etc.
is taken to adopt the return period for design of roadside drains. Drains in rural
area may be designed for a 10 year flood, however,
it may be prudent to design a drain in an
urban section (failure of drain may cause severe hazards for urban population) for a 25 year
return period.
The Return Period, generally adopted in design of roadside drains is given in Clause 7.1.4.

Illustrating Cost Optimization Study for Determining Design Return Period
Check Flood
The Flood event chosen for designing roadside drains is called the Design Flood. Presumption
of a given design circumstances naturally brings with
it an associated risk because the design
discharge, whatever be the estimated value, is susceptible to be exceeded. For a road project,
if a section of roadside drain or a cross drainage structure is designed for a flood of 25 years
Return Period,
it is likely to fail (hydrologically, may not be structurally)
if a flood of 50 Years
Return Period strikes the area.
It
is an accepted international practice to test the anticipated performance of the designed
drain section (or any cross drainage structure) against a flood of rarer value, called Check
Flood. The anticipated damage, when a check flood hits the area, should not cause irreparable
damage to the drain section or structure designed with a flood of lesser peak (Design Flood).
The roadside drains are generally provided with a freeboard of 150 mm over design water
level. The section might be so designed that Check Flood may pass through the section with
say "no" available freeboard. Such a consideration might protect an area from prolonged
inundation when a flood rarer that the Design Flood hits the area.
A Check Flood
is generally considered as a flood having next higher commonly followed
Recurrence Interval. For example, a bridge designed with 50 year design flood should be
checked with 100 year flood. Similarly, a drain section designed with 10 year design flood
should be checked against 25 year design flood.

6.3.2
Catchment area
Delineation of catchment area
is a very important step to estimate peak discharge as
it has
a direct linkage with the flood peak.
Flow from catchment area contributing to roadside drains comprises two parts
viz. runoff
from road surface and runoff from adjacent land leading to roadside (toe) drain.
Surface of Proposed Road Runoff
Runoff from proposed road depends on the width and camber of proposed road. For straight
reaches, half the design width of road may be taken whereas for super-elevated reaches, full
design width should be taken (duly considering the proposed paved or unpaved portions in
both cases).
Adjacent Land Runoff
Runoff from adjacent land depends on the topographical features (resultant slope towards
the drain,
in particular) of the area and
is not limited to the width of proposed ROW.
It
is,
therefore, necessary to gather information on natural or manmade ridge lines running along
the proposed road alignment. These ridges should be considered as boundary for defining
catchment area contributing to flow from the adjacent width of lands.
It may be reasonable to
linearly increase the length of catchment area with increase
in length of road and roadside
drains.
•
^
Contribution of flow from adjacent land shall depend on the transverse slope of land. For a
uniform transverse slope across the proposed alignment, roadside drain on one side shall
intercept the flow whereas roadside drain on the other side shall carry runoff from road
surface only.
Physical survey picking up spot levels to generate contour map of the area is the best option
for delineating catchment area. However, this is not a realistic method due to prohibitive cost.
The cost effective measures are to study and analyze the following:

(http://srtm.usgs.gov). These data are

for small areas in hilly terrain. Even for large catchments in flat terrain, these
data are useful.
ii)
Google Earth Images are very useful
in delineating small catchment areas.
The accuracy of manual delineation increases in rolling to hilly terrain. Special
care is required for delineating very small catchments in flat terrains. Google
Earth Imageries are freely available and widely used these days.
Annexure
II: provides a brief pictorial detail of delineating catchment area
on Google Image.
iii)
Topo sheets of different scales are available from Survey of India. These
data could
still be useful
in delineating catchments. However, a designer
58



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
should be very careful while marking ridge line between two contours of very
large intervals (generally 20 m interval is available in topo sheets).
6.3.3
Initial abstractions
A part of the precipitation gets captured by leaves of vegetative cover and trees,
natural
depressions and similar features
in a watershed. This
part,
called
Initial Abstractions,
of
the precipitation does not contribute to generate the peak as this either gets evaporated
or infiltrated or reaches the outfall of the watershed when the peak has already passed.
Vegetative cover, permeability of soil and existence of ditches/ponds
etc. thus affect the
peak runoff from a catchment. These factors should, therefore, be given due considerations
in hydrological design.
Soil Group
The rate of infiltration depends on permeability criteria of soil
in the watershed and on the
presence of vegetation. For example, precipitation on sandy soils may infiltrate at four to five
times the rate of infiltration in clay soils. Thus, the hydrologist/design engineer should gather
information on the type of soils. Based on the type and runoff potential, soils are generally
classified into four major groups, as detailed in Table 6.3 below:
Table 6.3
Soil Group
Soil Group
Description of Soil Characteristics
A
Soils having very low runoff potential (deep sands with very little silt or clay)
B
Light soils and/or well-structured soils having above average infiltration when
thoroughly wetted (light sandy loams, silty loams)
C
Medium
soils and
shallow
soils
having
below average
infiltration when
thoroughly wetted (clay loams)
D
Soils having high runoff potential (heavy soils of high swelling capacity and
very shallow soils underlain by dense clay horizons)
Land Use
Land use is about the distribution of impervious and pervious cover in the catchment. Rain
water which falls on impervious surfaces, such as paved areas, parking lots and rooftops,
will emerge almost fully as runoff. However, rainwater that falls on a pervious surface may
infiltrate into soil layers, and not running off immediately or at all. The rate of this infiltration
is also related with land use.
Annexures
III (a) and (b) reflects the change in design parameters with change in type of
soil and land use of the catchment.
6.3.4
Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC)
Antecedent moisture of soil describes the relative wetness or dryness of a catchment before
the design storm hits the area. Antecedent moisture conditions can have a very significant
59



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 148
======================================================================
!RC:SP:42-2014
effect on the flow responses. The antecedent moisture condition was grouped
in to three
levels according to the total amount of rainfall
in last 5 days before the design storm and
is
given in Table 6.4.
Table 6.4 Antecedent Moisture Conditions

II (Normal)
12.7 to 28.0
36.0 to 54.0
III (Wet)
>28.0
>54.0
The hydrologist should suitably consider,
in
his design, the AMC based on the recorded
rainfall for the last 5 days.
In case records are not available, the rainfall distribution pattern of
the area (viz. number of rainy days in a season, duration of a rainfall event, in general) should
be studied for judicious selection of AMC in hydrological design.
6.3.5
Runoff coefficient V
Some methods of runoff estimation (e.g. the rational method) address the effect of catchment
characteristics through the single coefficient of runoff 'P'. The coefficient of runoff 'P' for the
given area
is not constant but depends on the porosity of the soil, vegetation cover, surface
storage, slope,
initial
soil moisture capacity
etc. A hydrologist/engineer should decide an
appropriate value of 'P' based on the experience, judgment and the catchment characteristics.
Some suggested value of 'P' for use in Rational Formulae is given in Table 6.5 below:

Time of Concentration
The storm duration chosen for design purposes
is equal to the "time of concentration", and
is based on the assumption that the maximum discharge at any outfall point occurs when
60



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
the entire catchment is contributing to the flow. The time of concentration for any watershed
is the time required for a given drop of water from the hydrologically most remote part of the
watershed to reach the point of exit. They may have two components;
(i) entry time, and
(ii) time of flow.
If the drainage point under consideration
is at the entry of the drainage
system. Then the entry time
is equal to the time of concentration.
If, however, the drainage
point is situated elsewhere, then the time of concentration
is sum of the entry time and the
time required by the raindrop to traverse the length of the drainage system to the point under
study.
For roadside drains, the entry time indicates time of entry either from road surface or from the
nearest ridge (manmade or natural) to any point of the stretch of drain. Time of flow indicates
the flow time through the drain to reach the nearest outfall.
The time of concentration can be estimated with reasonable accuracy with the help of common
equations of hydraulics. All that
it calls for is desk study of the valley lines of the watershed to
trace the flow path and estimate the velocity of water in various sections.
Travel Time
Travel time
(T^)
is the time
it takes for water to travel from one location
to another
in a
catchment area. T^ is a component of time of concentration (T^). T^ is computed by summing
all the travel times for consecutive components of the drainage conveyance system. Water
moves through a catchment area as sheet flow, shallow concentrated flow, open channel
flow, or some combination of these.

A hydrologist/design engineer can suitably adopt the value 'n' depending upon the catchment
characteristics, which generate surface flow regime.

Design IVIethodologies
To estimate the peak runoff requiring disposal at a given
instant, the engineer must have
information regarding the rainfall within the catchment area and frequency with which this

======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
precipitation would produce peak runoff. Knowledge must be coupled with experience,
if data
are to be correctly interpreted. Some of most popular methods used worldwide for estimation
of peak runoff are the Empirical Formulas, Rational Method, SCS Curve Number Method.
Unit Hydrograph approach,
is not used for roadside drainage design as the catchment areas
are too small to demand such precision.
6.4.1
Dickens formula
One of the most popular empirical formula, which
is used very significantly in various part of
India for the estimation of flood peak,
is the Dickens Formula. This formula is directly related
with the flood peak to the drainage area. The expression of this formula is given as follows:
Q= C/\3/4
where,
Q
=
Maximum Flood Peak in Cumecs
A
=

C

Rational method
The rational method
is appropriate for estimating peak discharges for small drainage areas
of up to about 25 sq. km. The idea behind the Rational Method
is spatially and temporally
uniform
critical
rainfall
intensity, which continues
indefinitely. The runoff at the outlet of a
catchment
will increase
until the time of concentration

SCS method (runoff curve number mettiod)
The SCS (Soil Conservation Services) iVlethod (or Runoff Curve Number method) of estimating
direct runoff from storm
rainfall
is based on methods developed by U.S Soil Conservation
Services hydrologists. The principal application of the method
is
in estimating quantities of
runoff in flood hydrograph or in relation to flood peak rates. These quantities consist of one or
more of channel runoff, surface runoff, subsurface flow or base flow. All types do not regularly
appear on all catchments.
In drainage design, the SCS methods can be effectively used to estimate direct runoff by
means of Runoff Curve Number (CN) as per Table 6.8.
If records of natural
rainfall and runoff for a large storm over a small area used, a plot of
accumulated
runoff verses accumulated
rainfall
will show
that
runoff
starts
after some
rain
accumulates,
which
is
the
initial
abstraction
consisting
of
interception,
infiltration
and depression storage. For the simpler storm the relation between
rainfall,
runoff,
initial
abstraction and potential maximum retention can be expressed as:
where.
Q
=
storm runoff in mm
P
=
storm rainfall in mm
I
=
initial abstraction in mm
a
S
=
potential maximum retention in mm
For the simplicity of the above equation for estimating runoff, the relation between
1^ and S
was developed by means of rainfall and runoff data from experimental small catchments. The
empirical relation
is:
/ =0.2S
a
The
Initial
abstraction
/
can be
selected from Table
6.9
for
different values
of curve
a
numbers.
Therefore, the above equation for estimating the storm runoff is expressed as:
iP-0.2Sf
P + O.SS
The
potential maximum
retention S
is
related
to a curve number (CN) by the empirical
expression:
S=^-254
CN
6.4.3.1
Curve number
The curve numbers depend on the
soil type, general hydrologic condition of watershed,
land use & treatment, and Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC). The curve number for
Average Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC-II) is given in Annexure
III (a) and developed

Peak runoff
SCS method can be used to estimate the runoff volume as well as the peak discharge.
For design of roadside drains, estimation of peak discharges
if of prime importance. The
peak discharge should be estimated by first identifying the appropriate SCS 24 hour rainfall
distribution type over the watershed. Fig. 6.3 shows the graphical representation of various
SCS 24 hour rainfall distribution types. The hydrologist/design engineer may adopt the rainfall
distribution pattern appropriate for the catchment concerned.

Compilation and Presentation of Design Output
These days,
it has become mandatory for NHAI projects to submit drainage profile along
with the Detailed Project Reports of new projects or upgrade of existing Highway projects.
An easy and acceptable approach
to prepare drainage
profile may be standardizing the
runoff potential of the study area by classifying the areas into different zones on the basis
of hydro-meteorological and physical characteristics of the study area. Runoff from zones,
thus classified, may be estimated in correlation with the length of drain and tabulated. Such
discharge table, when made available to the hydraulic engineer, can be readily used for
hydraulic analysis for final sizing of the drains for different stretches (of varying slopes) along
the project road.

7 HYDRAULIC DESIGN OF ROAD DRAINAGE
7.1
General
7.1.1
Data collection
Designer of road drainage system must be familiar with
(i) the terrain through which the
road
is passing
(ii) the
natural drainage system
prevailing
before the road
construction
(iii)
rivers
and
its
tributaries
draining
the
area
(iv)
ponds
and
other
water
bodies
(v) topographic features
like
habitats,
industries, marketing places,
institutional
buildings,
existing roads, foot tracks, cable lines, gas, electrical and telephone lines, railway lines etc.
(vi) details of existing drainage, canals
, marshy land, waterlogged and flooded areas, forest
areas, agricultural areas,
rural and
built up areas (with future expansion) etc.
(vii)
rainfall
and runoff
(viii)
soil, subsoil and cover conditions, high water marks
etc.
including taking
of photographs at
site. Although most of this information are available from the relevant
updated topo-sheets of the area, a site visit by the drainage engineer is obligatory. He/She
can
collect many of the
vital
information needed
for drainage design by
interacting with
local people, panchayats and district authorities, central and state Govt, organizations (e.g.
PWD, Irrigation, Agriculture etc.) who may be in possession of similar data to meet their own
requirement. Broadly, the data may be grouped as follows:
Topographic Data
Various topographic features as stated above are available from topo-sheets prepared and
sold by Survey of India and other local bodies. Google earth software prepared from satellite
imageries are extremely useful
in finding
natural drainage systems and
their catchment
areas, different topographic features, terrain slope,
soil and sub-soil conditions, vegetative
cover etc.
Survey Data
As per TOR prescribed by the road authorities,
it
is mandatory to conduct road survey to
fix up alignment of the road indicating general features, streams, canals, water bodies like
ponds etc. crossing/adjacent to the proposed road. Levels are taken for preparing L-sections
and cross-sections of the road indicating ground levels. Contour maps are prepared for every
kilometer of the road by interpolation using suitable softwares. This information collected from
site together with the topo-sheets (either from SOI or from Google earth) form the backbone
for planning and designing the drainage works, both longitudinal and cross drainage.
Hydrological Data
It includes intensity, duration and frequency of rainfall needed for estimation of flow of different
return periods. Hydrological design of drainage is discussed separately under Section-6.
Stream Data
L-section and cross-sections of all the streams/nallas/canals etc. are to be plotted indicating
bed and bank levels, ground
levels, HFL/FSL etc.
for the design of drainage and cross-
drainage works like bridges and culverts. In case Gauge-Discharge (G-D) stations are there
on the streams, annual peak flow and corresponding HFL data should be collected from the
69



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
competent authorities. Stream flow data
like depth, discharge, HFL etc. are also available
from Water Users Association (WUA) in many a states. Morphological characteristics of the
streams, their meandering, tortuisity and skewness to road alignment, debris carried during
flood season, weeds and jungles growing
in the stream bed and bank etc. are very
vital
information needed for the design of drains and cross drainage structures.
Sediment Data
Besides water,
all streams carry sediments either as bed load or as suspended load. Many
of the CWC/State G-D stations have arrangements to measure the size and mass rate of
sediment flow, especially during flood seasons when most of the sediments flow. Sediment
sample should be collected from stream bed and banks for determining mean size (d^g) of the
sediments by sieve analysis.
Soil and Ground Data
The flow running through the drains and culverts are often found to scour the unlined bed
and bank causing flow tortuosity and damage to the road and road structures.
It is, therefore,
necessary to broadly group the soil to find the roughness and maximum permissible velocity
as per Table 7.1
, essentially needed to decide which stretches of the road drain require lining
or protective works. Usually, the bed slope of the drain follows the existing ground slope along
the road.
Ideally, top level of the drain should coincide with ground level at as many points
as feasible
in order to avoid excessive cutting or filling.
It may be necessary to change the
bed slope wherever ground slope changes.
In steeply sloping ground,
it may be necessary
to construct drop structures or provide drain with stepped bed/chutes.
Sub-Soil Data
Sub-soil data
e.g. depth
of water table,
soil
texture,
permeability of sub-soil
etc.
will be
useful
for the design of sub-soil drainage system and GSB
layer. Sand and gravel
filled
sub-soil drainage trenches covered with graded
filter or geo-synthetic/geo-jute textiles are
very effective
in sub-soil drainage, especially
in the waterlogged and marshy areas. Such
highly pervious trenches
filled with sand and gravel and protected with textiles permitting
unidirectional flow movement (i.e. from sub-soil under the paved road towards the shoulder
only and not vice-versa) constructed
at the junction of paved road surface and unpaved
shoulders help
in controlling moisture content of soil under the pavement thereby reducing
the possibility of differential settlement and undulation of road surface.
7.1.2
Drainage requirement
For
hydraulic
design,
the
first
requirement
is
to
prepare
a
statement
of the
drainage
requirements
in the different reaches of the road from the data collected and information
gathered from the site visit. When the road runs along a ridge or water shade lines, the cost
of road embankment and the drainage works
is the least. However, unlike a canal, a road
has to connect rural and urban areas and
it may not be always possible to align
it along the
ridgelines
all along the road. No drain
is needed
in reaches where the road runs along the
ridge/watershed line. In hilly and sub-hilly terrains, intercepting drains are required only along
|
the foot of the hills.
In areas where the road is in cut, drains are needed on both sides of the
!
road.
In a sloping terrain, intercepting drain
is needed on the upstream side only. Usually
unlined drains are provided in rural and agricultural areas where land
is cheap and available
70



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
ROW is sufficient to accommodate unlined drains having larger size compared to lined ones.
In the urban and built up areas where cost of land
is high and land
is not readily available,
lined drains or covered concrete drains are preferred from the viewpoints of land availability,
need for regular cleaning of the open drains (used mostly as garbage bins by public), as well
as from hygienic/aesthetical considerations. Where the road runs on high embankments,
runoff from the road surface should be collected
in a road side gutter and disposed through
the intermittent drainage chutes at suitable intervals so that the water flowing
in the gutter
does not spread out to the road surface beyond a permissible
limit. Since stepped chutes
are self-dissipating structures, no additional energy dissipater is required at the toe of road.
Where service roads are required in built up areas,
it is desirable to provide an inner drain at
the junction between the carriageway and the service road in addition to a covered outer drain
top of which can be used as footpath.
In the super elevated reaches, special arrangements
are needed to collect the water in the median and direct the flow to the countryside through
buried pipes.
Fig. 7.1
illustrates a typical road section
in urban/built up areas with inner and outer drains.
Figs. 7.2 and 7.3
illustrate typical ditch sections without and with
lining
in mild and steep
sloping terrains respectively. Fig. 7.4 shows typical longitudinal Ditches on either side of a
road
in Cut section. Fig. 7.5 Shows Typical Plan and Section of a road passing through an
urban area.
7.1.3
Drainage discharge
The drainage plan and profile should be plotted on the plan and profile of the road indicating
type of drains
(or no drain), slope,
outlet points
(at culverts and
bridges), change points
(change in slope or change
in flow direction), invert levels etc. After deciding the types and
arrangements of drainage discussed under Section-4, design discharge for the drains (Inner
& outer drains, road side gutters, inlets, median etc.) in straight and super elevated reaches
in rural and built up areas should be found (by using hydrological principles discussed under
Section-6)
in a tabular form given below. While preparing the table, the stretches of road
should be sub-divided
in to different sections depending upon change points and outfalls,
indicating chainages, slope, type of drain, flow direction, cross-drainage structures etc.
Where there are inner drains
in between the carriageway and service
road, the design
discharge for inner drains
is to be found based on the drainage area of carriageway and
median. The flow into the outer drain
is usually from catchment area consisting of service
road and the countryside.
In case the catchment area beyond ROW is large, runoff from the
service road may be diverted towards inner drain by providing camber towards the inner
drain. In the super elevated stretches, the inner drains towards the inner side of the road are
to carry the flow from the whole of carriageway. Distribution of runoff amongst the inner and
outer drains in straight and super-elevated reaches should be carried out carefully as per the
road surface profile.

Once the quantity of runoff has been determined, the stage is set for the next step of hydraulic
design of the drain.
It is convenient to discuss the design of side drains for urban and rural
areas separately.
7.1.4
Urban area
Side drain sections in urban areas are generally restricted to right triangular sections due to
the provision of a vertical kerb at the end of the carriageway or the shoulder. The gutter section
is normally 0.3 to
1 m wide having a cross slope steeper than that of the adjacent surfacing,
usually
1
: 1 2 or the cross slope of the pavement might continue to the kerb. The kerb confines
the storm runoff to the gutter section. The overflow spills to the adjacent paved surface, when
the gutter capacity
is exceeded. The capacity of a gutter depends upon
its cross-section,
grade and roughness. At intervals the water
is removed from the gutter section by outlets.
The spacing of the outlets is determined by the design discharge, the carrying capacity of the
gutter and the allowable spread of water on travelled way. A suggested assumption is that the
flow should not encroach on the outside lane by more than
1 .8 m for a storm of 20 minutes
duration and one year return period.
It is reasoned that storms of shorter duration have such
high intensities that vehicles must travel slowly since vision is obscured by rain pelting on the
windshields.
The following design frequencies and water spread
in different categories of roads may be
adopted for design similar to the recommendation by AASTHO for different categories of
roads in USA.

7.1.5
Rural area
In rural highways, side ditches are normally placed alongside the roadway in order to intercept
surface water running
off the carriageway and shoulders.
In cut sections they also serve
to prevent water running down the cut slopes and invading the roadway. Side ditches are
usually V-shaped or trapezoidal in cross-section. On low-cost roads the V-ditch is very often
favoured because
it can be more economically formed.
If equipment is available, the same is
also amenable to quick and economic maintenance with the help of a motor grader. V-shaped
drains are very popular in India in
hill sections. On high type of roads, the trapezoidal section
77



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
is generally preferred because of its greater carrying capacity. Right triangle ditches are also
sometimes used on rural highway where a kerb is placed on the outer edge of the surfaced
shoulder on a
fill section when water cannot be permitted to run down the embankment
slope. Care should always be taken to ensure that the water surface level
in the road side
ditches during intense storms is below the sub-grade level.
On important roads, however, the hydraulic capacity of ditches should be checked to ensure
that they are able to handle the expected flows without danger either to traffic, the embankment
or the road structure. This is especially important of the ditches carrying water from adjacent
back slopes as well as from the roadway. Vehicle safety considerations usually govern the
ditch side-slopes on important roads, preference being given
to the use of relatively
flat
slopes, especially on the side closest to the carriageway. Capacity of a ditch can better be
increased by widening than by deepening the channel so that velocity and erosion are also
reduced.
In reaches where the velocity corresponding to design discharge in the road side
ditches
is found to be higher than the maximum permissible velocity (Table-7.1), the drain
should be lined to avoid erosion and damage to toe of the road. Unlined open drains subject
to erosion usually causes meandering and damage to toe. In reaches where the terrain slope
is steep, either stepped bed or flumed chutes made of concrete may be adopted to avoid
erosion.
To prevent erosion of lined drains due to free flowing water down the embankment slope,
unlined drain should be located at minimum distance of 2H from the toe of the embankment,
where H
is the height of road top above ground as shown in Fig. 7.6.

Open Channel Design

A
=
Area of the flow cross-section in m^.
Subscripts
1 and 2 refer to successive cross-sections in the uniform flow path
In design of roadside channels, the flow of water is assumed as sub-critical flow. The slope
and velocity are kept below the critical level. Critical depth of flow 'd^' in open channel
is that
depth at which specific energy
is minimum. On mild slope flow
is sub-critical and normal
depth of flow "d^" is more than critical depth. For rectangular channel d^ = (QWg)^'^ where 'g'
is acceleration due to gravity and b is width of channel.
If d^<d^, the slope and channel section
should be redesigned so that d^>d^. Stepped Chutes should be provided where ground slope
is steep.
Values of "n" for various channel surfaces are given
in Table 7.1. The
soil
classification
used
in the Table is the Extended Casagrande Classification. Also shown are the maximum
permissible velocity values for various types of ditch lining. Velocity values in excess of these
will cause erosion in the ditches, which will not only increase the maintenance cost, but also,
in the case of side ditches may weaken the road structurally.
Open-channel design can be accomplished by solving the Manning's equation numerically.
As this procedure
is tedious and time consuming, chart solutions have been developed to
solve the problems commonly occurring. Solution can be found very quickly using excel
program in computer.

Road side gutter
Curbing with roadside gutter at the outside edge of pavements
is a normal practice for low
speed, urban highway facilities.
In rural areas too, where the road runs in high embankment
and storm water is not allowed to flow over embankment slopes (to avoid erosion), roadside
gutter with kerb at the edge
is a must. Gutters may be triangular, V-shaped, curved or of
composite cross-slopes as illustrated in Figs. 8.1 to 8.6 given in Section 8.
Hydraulic design principles of some of the roadside gutter are discussed underneath.
Triangular Channel Section
The Manning equation cannot be used without modification to compute flow in right triangular
sections as used
in urban or hilly areas because the hydraulic radius does not adequately
describe the drain section particularly when the top width of water surface may be more than
40 times the depth (d) of curb. To compute drain flow, the Manning equation for an increment
of width
is integrated across the width Zd and the resulting formula
is:
where,
Q
=
0.315/n

... Eqn. 4
Z
=
Reciprocal of cross slope
d
=
Depth of Channel in m
T
=
Spread of water in m
F, (Z) =

In terms of spread width (T in Fig. 7.7), the equation becomes
Q = (0.31 7/n) (8/3 S^'^ -ps/s)
Eqn.5
V-Shaped Channel Section
Manning's formula is
Q = 1/n F„(Z)d«'3si/2
...Eqn. 6
where.

Inlets
Inlets are drainage structures utilized to collect surface water through grate or curb openings
and convey
it to storm water drains or direct outlet to culverts or side ditches. Grate inlets
subject to traffic shall be made safe for the passage of bicycles, and shall be load bearing.
Appropriate frame
is to be provided where required.
Inlets used for gutters can be divided
into four major groups. They are:
a)
Curb opening inlets- They are vertical openings
in the curb and may be
covered by a top slab
b)
Grate Inlets- They are openings in the gutter covered by grates
c)
Combination inlets- They consist of both curb-opening inlet and grate inlet
placed in a side-by-side configuration. Curb opening may be located in part
upstream of grate
d)
Slotted drain- They consist of a slotted opening along the curb with bars
perpendicular to the opening. Slotted inlets function essentially in the same
manner as curb inlets i.e. as weirs with flow entering from the side.
e)
Flanking inlets- Where significant ponding can occur,
in locations such as
underpasses and in sag vertical curves in depressed sections, flanking inlets
are provided on each side of the
inlet at the lowest point
in the sag. The
Q = Qs/(1-Eo) and

flanking
inlets should be placed so that they
limit spread of water on low
gradient approaches and act in relief of the inlet at lowest point if it is clogged
or
if the design spread
is exceeded.
Various types of inlets are shown
in Figs. 7.9 to 7.12. Detailed hydraulic
design of inlets with nomograph is given in HEC-15.

Design steps
Each project
is unique, but the following design steps are normally applicable for design of
road side drains:
Step-1: Establish a Road Side Plan
i)
Collect site data
ii)
Prepare existing/proposed plan and profile layout showing highway, bridges,
culverts etc.
iii)
Plot on the plan the natural basin divides, outlets etc.
Step-2: Establish Cross-Section Data
i)
Determine channel width and depth adequate to carry surface/sub-surface
flow
ii)
Find safe side slope including economics, soil, aesthetics and access
iii)
Ensure that the conveyance of the channel
is adequate to carry design flow
iv)
Identify features that may restrict design due to right way limits, trees, utilities,
existing drainage facilities etc.
Step-3: Determine Channel Grade
i)
Plot grade on
plan-profile layout (grades
in cuts are usually controlled by
highway grade)
ii)
Provide a minimum grade of 0.3 percent (The grade need not be equal to
highway grade but normally follow existing ground profile to avoid deep cut
or fill). Provide falls/chutes,
if necessary
iii)
Consider influence of grade on type of lining necessary to prevent erosion
when the velocity of flow exceeds the maximum permissible velocity given in
Table 7.1.
iv)
Avoid features that may influence or restrict grade such as utilities etc.
Step-4: Check Flow Capacity and Adjust as necessary
i)
Compute the design discharge at the downstream end of different reaches/
segments as per hydrologic computations discussed in Section-6
86



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
ii)
Set preliminary values of channel size, roughness coefficient(n) and grade
iii)
Determine maximum permissible value of channel depth including freeboard
which
is usually kept as 0.1 m to 0.15 m.
iv)
Check conveyance of the channel using Manning's equation.
If capacity of
channel is found to be inadequate, make possible adjustments like increased
bottom width,
flatter side slopes, steeper grade, smoother channel
lining,
provision of drop inlets with parallel storm drain pipe beneath the channel
to supplement channel capacity, providing smooth transitions at change
in
channel sections, upstream storage to replace the floodplain storage with a
view to reduce peak discharge etc.
Step-5: Determine Channel Lining/Protection Needed
i)
Select suitable
lining when the
actual flow velocity exceeds
permissible
maximum velocity
ii)
Estimate
flow
depth
and choose
an
initial
value
of Manning's
n
from
Table 7.1
iii)
Calculate normal flow depth
"d^" at the design discharge using Manning's
equation and compare with estimated depth.
If they do not agree, repeat
steps
(ii) and
(iii)
iv)
Compute the mean
velocity
of flow
at normal depth and compare with
permissible maximum velocity for the given type of lining
v)
If the actual velocity exceeds the permissible velocity, consider the options
like
a)
More resistant lining like concrete, stone, gabion etc.
b)
Decrease channel grade
c)
Drop structures/stepped chutes
d)
Increased channel width/flatter side slope
Step-6: Analyze Outlet Points and Downstream Effects
i)
Identify any adverse impact to upstream and downstream properties due
to high afflux, high flow velocity, sheet flow, change
in outlet water quality,
increase in flow, diversion flow from another catchment etc.
ii)
Try to mitigate the above impact by
a)
Enlarging outlet capacity
b)
Installing velocity control structures
c)
Improved lining
d)
Installing
weirs
or
other
outlet
devices
in
order
to
redistribute
concentrated flow
e)
Installing sedimentation/infiltration basins

8 ROAD SIDE DITCHES AND DRAINS
8.1
The Purpose
The water collected primarily from surface runoff is required to be collected and disposed
of in a nearby culvert or bridge on a rivulet or river. To facilitate disposal of surface water,
earthen side-ditches or lined drains are provided on both sides of the pavement. Depending
upon the type of soil encountered, whether road is in cut or a
fill section or in an urban or rural
location, the type of side-drain/ditch is planned.
8.2
Cross-section of Side Ditch/Drain
There are a few typical cross-sections which are adopted viz. triangular, rectangular, parabolic,
saucer shaped and trapezoidal as shown in Figs. 8.1 to 8.6. Side ditches in natural ground
provided are either rectangular or trapezoidal. These trenches can be formed either manually
or by trench cutter. Lately these trenches can be formed by trench cutter using electronic
sensor for achieving the required gradient and
invert level accurately. Of
all the designs,
parabolic section
is hydraulically efficient and
it is erosion resistant although
it is difficult to
form. The triangular section is easy to form, but
it gets silted fast and thus blocking the water
flow requiring constant maintenance. The rectangular section
is commonly used
in urban
areas where
it is normally lined with ROC. This section
is easy to clean and maintain. Lined
drains can be designed to place a ROC slab or steel grating so that pedestrians and vehicles
can move on
it. But unlined rectangular drains tend to erode and collapse in the presence of
flowing water.

VARIABLE
SECONDARY CHANNEL
Fig. 8.5 A Trapezoidal Drain With a Secondary
Channel
Fig. 8.6 V-Cross-Section of a Drain
The size of the side drain is decided by the quantity of water to be discharged using Manning's
formula which
is explained
in Section
7. Normally the longitudinal gradient of invert shall
be as much as possible parallel to the road
profile but
it may change where
it cannot be
maintained. For facilitating easy cleaning, the width at bottom should be at least 0.3 m. The
invert level of drain should preferably be kept such that the water surface corresponding
to design discharge remain at least 0.3 m to 0.6 below the bottom of drainage layer of the
pavement. The earthen drains,
if found inadequate to carry the discharge, can be widened
after observing
its performance after first monsoon. The earthen drain must not be allowed
to run full for long duration as
it may lead to erosion of sides.
8.3
Drain Linings
Earthen ditches, unless they are flat and shallow, tend to get eroded.
In the case of urban
roads, however, due to constraint of space and safety considerations of pedestrians they
have to be lined. The material used for lining varies from RCC, stone slabs, bricks, precast
sections, stone masonry, stone slabs, turfing, geosynthetic material covered with grass etc.
The option of lining depends on the
availability of construction
material
locally, and cost
consideration etc.
8.4
Reinforced Cement Concrete Lining
RCC
lining
is suitable for drain of any cross-section. Precast concrete (RCC)
linings are
randomly easy to construct and the work can be done faster. The RCC lining tends to crack
due shrinkage and hence needs to be provided with sealed joints at 8 to 10 m interval or as
specified
in the contract. All the joints have to be sealed effectively with sealants in order to
stop seepage of water. Open drains are normally covered
in urban stretches for safety of
pedestrians and for using the area for footpath etc.
A view of a RCC lined trapezoidal drain can be seen
in Photo 8.1. Lack of maintenance
has resulted
in growth of vegetation inside drain affecting free flow of water as seen
in the
Photo 8.1.

Lining with rubble/coursed masonry
Lining of drain can be done using random rubble or coursed masonry, dry-stones and stone
slabs. Coursed rubble stone lining
is aesthetically more appealing and allows water to flow
smoothly but
it
is costly. Where stone
is available nearly this type of lining works out to be
economical. Use of brick
is popular where stones are not available.
In some South Indian
States use of stone slabs
is very common. A typical cross section of a drain with random
rubble masonry is given in Fig. 8.7.

(Fig. 8.8). Rectangular sections can be used where RCC cover or steel grating is required to
be placed on the top (Fig. 8.9).

Special Requirements of Drainage in Hilly Roads
8.5.1
Surface drainage
When a road passes through a hilly terrain,
it has usually
hill on one side and valley on the
other side. Runoff coming from the
hill side must be intercepted by providing a ditch at the
foot of the
hill and disposed of in the valley side by providing drainage culverts at suitable
intervals.
If drainage
is not adequate, the
runoff water
will flow above the road surface
resulting
in damage of the road as shown in Fig. 8.15. Often debris and stones fall into the
drain blocking
it and causing overflow of the drain and road. V-shaped shallow drains as
shown
in Figs. 8.6 and 8.14(a) are normally provided for safety of vehicles. The drains are
lined with concrete or stone masonry to avoid erosion since the longitudinal slope of drain
is quite high and
rolling stones cause high
friction. As these shallow drains have limited
conveying capacity, culverts are required at closer intervals compared to those in plain areas.
Spacing of the culverts is governed by the rainfall intensity, width of terrain (normal to road)
contributing to runoff, slope of the ditches etc. Typical
inlet of a pipe culvert and optimum
93



======================================================================
PAGE 102 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
spacing of culvert designed for a hilly road
in Northeast is illustrated
in Figs. 8.16 and 8.17.
Culverts are required at innumerable streams crossing the road for passage of fishes and
stones brought by these streams. The outlets of culverts need proper arrangement for flow
diffusion, energy dissipation and anti-erosion measures.
Unlike plain terrain, culvert inlets must be properly designed so that the stones do not block
the culverts and they can easily be cleared of debris and stones. When deep rectangular
or trapezoidal drains are required to be provided to increase conveyance, the drain should
be covered with perforated slabs on top for safety of traffic. Width of road side ditches
is
normally restricted to 60 cm since wide drains require large volume of cutting on
hill side
which
is not only costly but
it causes
instability of
hill side slope requiring costly retaining
walls. Stepped chutes/baffles are to be provided where the longitudinal bed slope exceeds
critical stage to prevent supercritical flow resulting
in shock waves in curved areas, change
in direction, change in width etc.
8.5.2
Sub-surface drainage/Intercepting drains at higher altitude
Water table
in a
hilly region follows more or less the gradient same as that of
hill slope.
When a cut
is made
in the
hill
to accommodate a
road,
there
is seepage flow
into the
side
ditch.
Suitable weep
holes are
to be provided
to take care
of the seeping
water.
Otherwise, pore-water pressure will build up resulting in slope failure with failure of retaining
walls.
Where the width of terrain (at right angle to the road) contributing to flow in to the drain is very
high, additional intercepting drain at higher elevations may be needed to reduce the inflow
into the road side ditches of limited conveying capacity, (see Fig. 5.11)

9 CROSS-DRAINAGE WORKS AND DRAINAGE OF BRIDGE DECK
9.1
Necessity of Drainage Culverts
Construction of a road embankment unavoidably obstructs and interferes
witli the natural
overland flow and flow through the natural channels e.g.
rivers,
nallas, canals, drains etc.
Suitable cross-drainage works
like bridges and culverts under the road must be provided
across these channels
with
a view
to pass
the peak discharge through
the channels
without causing harmful afflux and disturbing the natural flow regime. Provision of adequate
numbers of culverts and
outfall
points of appropriate size
is a
prerequisite for a healthy
road. Submergence and overtopping of road not only causes damage to the road and road
structures,
it results in disruption of traffic, loss of travel time and miseries to many of the poor
people who take shelter on roads during floods in many parts of our country.
Overland flow, which would otherwise meet the natural stream at some downstream point,
must be intercepted
in
longitudinal drains and discharged back
into the nearest natural
drainage channel through culverts and bridges. The local drainage arrangements consisting
of longitudinal drains and culverts shall have to be designed to carry the runoff from the road
surface too.
Where a road runs in an undulating terrain, causeways or dips are often provided in valleys to
avoid road in high embankment. Frequent dipping down from high road levels to the ground
produces a very undesirable road
profile. Constructing bridges and culverts under road
in
high embankment is a better proposition than providing so many dips and causeways leading
to disruption
in
traffic movement during flood season. Bridges, culverts and underpasses
are often used by local people and livestock to cross the busy roads like national and state
highways
in high embankments. They also act as passage for up and down movement of
fish and other aquatic animals. Sediments and debris carried by the stream, especially during
floods, must freely move downstream through these openings to avoid aggradations and
other interrelated problems. For existing roads,
it
is not uncommon to find silted barrels of
existing culverts and culverts having inadequate capacities causing overtopping of the road
embankments. In a very flat terrain, most of the streams are shallow and the banks are spilled
with flood water moving in wide flood plains. In the absence of road, the spill flow moving over
the land surface constitutes a substantial amount of peak flood. When a road is built in such a
terrain with wide flood plains, the entire flood water has to move across the road through the
bridge opening of limited span, resulting in very high afflux and other problems. Usually, the
spill water is found to move along the toe of the road causing scouring and damage to road
embankment. Provision of relief culverts on either side of the bridges in such flood plains are
very helpful in the quick disposal of spill flood across the road which results in less afflux and
ensures safety of the road embankment.
9.2
Planning of Culverts for Effective Road Drainage
Design of an efficient cross-drainage system is a prerequisite for success of new road projects
and for rehabilitation projects as well. Proper planning of culverts is a very important aspect
97



======================================================================
PAGE 106 of 148
======================================================================
!RC:SP:42-2014
of road design from the point of view of safety of the road
- new or existing one. Planning
generally covers selection of location, type, numbers and size of culverts. To be most effective,
location of culverts have to be very carefully decided after studying the terrain and collecting
relevant information from topo sheets and other sources.
Field
visit and consultation with
local people and local authorities conversant with local topography and drainage problem of
the area is extremely useful.
A drainage culvert should be placed in a natural depression or valley points. These locations
are easily identifiable
in
hilly/rolling terrains but very
difficult to be identified
in
plains. An
easy method of identifying the depression/valley and direction of flow is contour study of the
project road corridor and a site visit to study drainage pattern of the area. The ground level
elevations along the toe of the road on upstream and downstream (L-Profile) should identify
the natural dips and thus suitable culvert locations and direction of flow.
It
is mandatory to
ensure a path for the runoff to reach the outfall point from culvert outlet either through existing
channel or roadside ditches or by overland flow. Flow coming out of the culvert must not
get accumulated at
its outlet jeopardizing the safety of the road embankment. Downstream
canalization, wherever feasible, may also be thought of to avoid such accumulation
of
water.
In order to reduce cost of drains and culverts, often the drain water is discharged into local
ponds, causing pollution of pond water which may be objected by the local people.
In such
situations, the drainage water may be directed to ground water recharge pits and the effluent
may be discharged into the ponds after appropriate treatment.
In the hilly terrains, culvert locations are identified directly from the presence of streamlets,
not big enough to be spanned by a bridge.
In the stretches where the road
is planned by
cutting
hill slopes, innumerable streamlets come down the hill slopes and cross the proposed
road. Runoff water and sediments from such streamlets must be disposed of either directly
through culverts at the crossings and/or intercepted by longitudinal drains and disposed off in
to the valley through closely spaced intermediate culverts with a view to limit the drain size.
Box or slab type culverts or small bridges are suitable for free movement of the incoming
water when
it carries a lot of sediments and debris.
It is necessary that the span of culverts
should be equal to or a little more than the linear waterway at design HFL for such streamlets
flowing at supercritical velocity.
In the
plains, however, the available
longitudinal slope along the proposed alignment
is
generally very flat and roadside ditches are commonly aligned with available longitudinal
slope for economy.
If the existing dips are long apart, the distance between an existing dip
and an adjacent ridge becomes too long entailing a bigger size of the ditch and acquisition of
more land. In such cases, intermediate culverts, also called balancing culverts, are proposed
just to reduce the length and size of the roadside ditches.
In fact, most of the culverts
in
plains are balancing in nature. However,
all natural dips may not be used as suitable culvert
locations.
It depends on the available longitudinal slope and consequently the required size
of the roadside ditches that govern the locations to be utilized as suitable culvert points.
If the
98



======================================================================
PAGE 107 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
available longitudinal slope is good enough to carry the roadside ditches for a longer distance
with reasonable size, some intermediate minor dips may be crossed over without having to
provide a culvert structure.
For roads planned alongside a major river (say Gangar/amuna Expressways),
it is frequently
observed
that
spill from
the
river originates from some upstream
point, comes
into the
countryside and again goes back and meets the river at some downstream point. Each of
these spills crosses the proposed road alignment (running almost parallel to river bank) at
two or more points - one at upstream point where from the spill channel originates and comes
to the countryside and the others at the downstream point where
it goes back and meets
the river again.
It
is a standard practice to plug the upstream crossing points and span the
downstream crossing locations with suitable culvert or bridge structure, depending on the
size of the
spill. The countryside length of the
spill channel, past the plugging
point, shall
carry the runoff from the local countryside catchment and the runoff must be disposed into
the river through the downstream opening.
The proposed alignment of the new road may also cross some small size
irrigation
field
channels and drains. These small sized canals and drains must be spanned by culverts/
syphons at their crossing points with the road.
For a road upgrading project, the task of selecting culvert locations reduces to selection of
locations for additional culverts only. Even
if the conveying capacity of some of the existing
culverts
is not hydraulically adequate, replacement of such culverts by a bigger size culvert
or a small bridge shall be made
in the existing locations only. For additional culverts, the
locations shall be based on the natural dips along the stretches of existing road vulnerable
to overtopping. An inventory of existing culverts has to be prepared indicating chainage, type
and size of culverts, invert levels at entry and exit of culverts, ground level and stream bed
level, condition of culverts, ponding
level, submergence of land, overtopping of road and
extent of overtopping etc. Such detailed inventory of culverts
is very helpful
in preparing an
adequacy statement for cross-drainage works and deciding which of the existing culverts/
bridges require replacement by larger size culverts or bridges and to decide whether additional
culverts will be needed or not.
9.3
Types and Size of Culverts
Culverts may be of several types and geometry, namely. Pipe Culverts (circular and elliptic),
Box culverts (square and rectangular). Slab and Arch culverts (with or without bottom slab)
etc. Selection of type and geometry of culverts
inter-alia depends on the required width
and area of opening, height and vertical clearance required, length of culvert and height of
embankment decided from geometries of road design. While
it is easier to decide between a
pipe culvert and box/slab culvert, selection between box and slab culvert is a matter of cost
optimization. For minor crossings, circular hume pipe culverts suffice hydraulically. However,
a pipe culvert has more joints owing to smaller length of precast pipe units manufactured
in
the market. The more the carriageway width of the road more will be the length of culvert
and consequently more will be the number of joints. As such
it has now become a common
99



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
practice for the major concessionaires to avoid pipe culverts for new major projects
like
GangaA'amuna expressway. However, for many other new projects
in
India, hume pipes
having minimum diameter of 1200 mm are being used.
For mountainous
regions,
the
culverts are generally provided
at frequent
interval.
Pipe
culverts are, therefore, very common in hilly stretches of roads. However, in stretches where
the streamlets carry large size cobbles and boulders, there is a fair possibility of pipes getting
damaged/choked. Pipe culverts are, therefore, avoided in such stretches and either slab type
or box type culverts are preferred. For crossings where pipe culverts may not be feasible
from hydraulic point of view, box or slab culverts are chosen for installation. From structural
definition, a box culvert is a reinforced box structure with rigid joints whereas a slab culvert
is one where a simply supported reinforced slab
is placed over abutments. Generally, for
medium height of embankments, both of the options viz., box culverts with road embankment
supported on roof slab and slab culvert with roof slab directly supporting the wheel loads,
are feasible. One of the options is chosen on the basis of LTEC (Least Total Expected Cost)
method.
For high embankments
(for example near approach
of bridges),
however, box
culverts are preferred
to slab culverts from both structural and economic considerations.
Box and slab culverts are suitable for mountainous reaches where the streamlets carry large
sized cobbles and boulders.
To avoid excessive scour in slab/Arch culverts, bed may be lined or unlined depending on
flow velocity and type of bed materials. Lining of bed helps
in preventing growth of weeds
which drastically reduces the conveying capacity of culvert due to high resistance offered by
such weeds and jungles.
The size of the culvert is designed on the basis of the following considerations from the points
of view of:
a)
Peak flow and hydraulic conveyance requirement
b)
Ease of maintenance and desilting operation
c)
Permissible velocity for fish movement where the channel carries fish
d)
Movement of debris, gravels, boulders etc.
The required size of the culvert is decided on the basis of hydrologic, hydraulic and structural
analysis. However, the minimum size of the culvert is fixed on the basis of ease in maintenance,
movement of fish, debris etc. For upgrading projects, hume pipe culverts having diameter
less than 900 mm are to be replaced with a minimum diameter 1200 mm as recommended
by IRC:SP:13.
9.4
Data Collection
Data may be collected from
site investigation/study of topo sheets/Satellite Imagery/local
enquiry and from records maintained by Government agencies like CWC, IMD, RDSO and
Irrigation/PWDs. Broadly, the several data required for the design of drainage culverts are:

by Central Water Commission (CWC), Govt, of India and flood estimation methods published
by RDSO (1990), Ministry of Railways, Govt, of India, provide valuable hydro-meteorological

Engineers).
Computations for design discharges for culverts by using SCS method by USGC
is given in
example 4 in Annexure V.
9.5
Bridge Drainage
Bridge drainage
is important from two aspects,
first
is drainage and other
is road safety.
It
is important to provide the effective drainage of runoff on bridges to avoid flooding of deck,
which may leads to traffic safety hazards and can severely
limit the
life span of concrete
deck. The uncontrolled flows of water,
will lead to corrosion of concrete and steel surfaces
below deck level.
Considering drainage aspect,
it
is enough
if all the water that
is precipitated on the bridge
in design
rainfall
is drained away quickly without allowing the traffic to stop.
Particularly
if
the bridge
is located
in a valley curve or in a valley on the road, the surface water from the
adjoining stretches of road are likely to flow to
it and cause ponding which may stop the traffic
at least for a short duration
9.6
Design Consideration
The drainage system for bridges are design as Open Drainage system,
i.e. allowing the
free fall of water when bridges pass through the water way i.e. River, Creek, Nallah etc. and
Closed drainage system
in which proper channelized Pipe conduit system are provided to
take the water to main drain applicable for Grade separator, side walk and
rail road right of
way beneath the bridges. Designer shall suitably select the appropriate drainage system
based on the project characteristics.
The design of a drain should be such that its inlet is large enough to admit lot of water easily.
It
is to be remembered that due to the
grill on top, the effective area of inlet
is reduced to
half. Moreover the velocity of water entering the drain
is
low. Hence the opening should
be flared to at least twice the size of the pipe. The type design of the MORTH
in which the
opening at top
is 30 cm X 30 cm for a 15 cm dia drain
is good from this angle (Figs. 9.1
to 9.3).

Details of Footpath Drain
In case of wider bridges the nunnbers of drainage spouts will have to be increased to match
the increased area to be drained.
In very wide bridges of 4x4 divided carriageways with a
central divider,
it may be better to provide a crown
in each carriageway and camber in both
direction and then to provide drainage spouts along both edges of each carriageway.
Deck Slab Drainage Inlet
: To ensure effective drainage of the bridge deck a minimum cross
slope of
1 percent and a minimum longitudinal grade of 0.5 percent should be provided with
103



======================================================================
PAGE 112 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
a gutters grading at
1 percent. The collected runoff water shall be taken by pipes through the
deck at regular interval. Grating the inlet points are necessary aids for achieving the efficient
drainage.
Drainage is especially important in the case of earth-filled arch spans and obligatory span as
inadequate drainage would saturate the earth filling and decrease the load bearing capacity
of the structure. Special drains will also be necessary at natural low spots of piers of arch
bridges to tap accumulated water and allow
it to flow out.
9.7
Sloping Ramps of Bridges and Flyovers
In case of sloping ramps of bridges or flyovers,
it is often said that due to the steep longitudinal
slope,
it is no use providing drainage spouts on the ramps, which creates pool of water at the
start of bridge approach. Considering the situation such as, a driver of a smaller car trying to
go up an approach ramp of a flyover or bridge in heavy rains faces a daunting situation with
a heavy stream of rainwater rushing towards him through which he has to drive his car. An
example of this is shown in Photo 9.1
. So whatever
1 0 or 20 percent water that can be taken
out by drains on sides will be a big help.
Photo 9.1
Pool of Water at the Start of Bridge Approach
In case of curved bridges (and roads too) due to super elevation, water tends to accumulate
near the central median, forming a small pond. A fast vehicle coming round the bend suddenly
sees the pond. Then either there will be a big splash or the vehicle will swerve suddenly to
avoid the pond. These possibilities both create an accident situation. Cross drains provided
at the valley curve covered with robust steel grating will help in disposing of surface water.
9.8
Spacing of Drainage Spout
In the olden days the standard practice was to provide drainage spouts at a spacing of 3 m on
both edges of a two lane bridge. But the inlets were of the same diameter as the drain pipes.
Some of these used to get choked due to debris or garbage fully or partly. Sometimes during
renewal of road surface, some of them used to get closed also. Design must cater to all such
contingencies. The drain openings should be in the deck slab. In case of submersible bridges
the discontinuous kerb provides ample drainage facilities.
In a segmental construction,
it
is easier to provide a drain hole
in each segment instead
of providing the drains at odd spacing which will result in some of the segments with drain
holes and some without drains. Hence
it
is suggested to provide the drain hole
in each
segment.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
9.9
Disposal of Drain Water
The water coming out of the spout can fall into the river or creek below. But the outlet should be
shaped so that
it does not fall on the superstructure.
It could be pointed away from the bridge.
There was a trend to provide long down take pipes to ensure that the water discharged does
not splash on to sides of main beams. But when
it is raining heavily the entire surroundings
are wet and moist. Hence long down take pipes are not favoured.
In case of a flyover or approach viaduct of a bridge or flyover,
if there is movement or existence
of other traffic or people below on at grade roads, the water coming out of drainage spouts
must be collected and led away. Such a collector system must be of large diameter, there
must be enough elbow plugs provided to facilitate frequent cleaning to prevent clogging. The
down take pipe
if taken through the body of the solid pier (Plioto 9.2) must be large enough
to avoid choking.
Ultimately the water must be led to the
city drainage system. Anti-theft
measures must be in place to prevent vandalism or thefts of pipes. Small things but they can
be very damaging
if not corrected.
Photo 9.2 Water Channelization
9.10
IVIaintenance of Drainage System
,
It
is very important to maintain the drainage system
in good working
order. This mainly
consists of looking at
all the drainage inlets frequently to see that they are not choked or
clogged. The elbow plugs must be opened and the pipes cleared of any material like paper,
plastic etc. which might have got lodged in the pipes. Any piece of pipe which might have got
damaged or taken away must be replaced forthwith. This aspect must be checked during the
pre-monsoon inspection of bridge structures and corrected wherever necessary.
The cost of drainage spouts as compared to that of the bridge
is minuscule. The public
judges the work not by the strength of concrete but by the alignment of parapet, the condition
of road surface, the expansion joints and the efficiency of drainage system. Hence
it is not
prudent to try to economize on
it at the cost of a water free bridge.

10 GROUND WATER RECHARGE FROM ROAD DRAINAGE
10.1
Introduction
The annual precipitation (including snowfall)
in India
is of the order of 4000 BCM and the
natural runoff in the rivers is computed to be about 1 869 BCM. The utilizable surface water and
replenish able ground water resources are of the order of 690 BCM and 433 BCM respectively.
Thus, the total water resources available for various uses, on an annual average basis, are
of the order of
1 1 23 BCM. Although the per capita availability of water in India
is about
1 300
cubic meters as in 2012 against the benchmark value of 1000 cum (signifying 'water-starved'
condition), there
is wide disparity in basin-wise water availability due to uneven rainfall and
varying population density in the country. The availability is as high as 14,057 cum per capita
in Brahmaputra/Barak Basin and as low as 307 cum in Sabarmati basin. Many other basins
like Mahi, Tapi, Pennar are already water stressed.
Indiscriminate ground water development has led to substantial ground water level declines
both
in hard rocks and alluvial areas threatening sustainability of this resource. Long-term
decline of ground water tables
is being observed
in many areas, mostly
in the states of
Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Delhi and Haryana. Apart from this,
in most of the
cities depending on ground water for drinking water supplies, water level decline up to 30 m
and more have been observed. Traditional water harvesting methods, which were in vogue in
arid and semi-arid areas of the country have either been abandoned or have become defunct
in most cases. There is an urgent need to revive these methods.
Excessive ground water development/use has
resulted
in
deterioration
of ground water
quality through salinity and other salt contamination e.g. arsenic/iron/fluoride/boron etc. and
saline water ingress
in coastal areas. Ground water development, therefore, needs to be
regulated and augmented through suitable measures to provide sustainability and protection.
Dependence on use of ground water for agriculture due to monsoon failures
is accelerating
ground water depletion
in rural areas also. Excessive withdrawal of ground water is further
compounding the stress on ground water system due to free/subsidized power
in some
states.
In order to tackle the burgeoning problem of water table decline and depletion of
ground water storage,
it is necessary to take up schemes for water conservation and artificial
recharge to ground water on priority basis.
Ground water resources
in several areas of the country are getting polluted due to over
application of fertilizers and pesticides, indiscriminate disposal of effluents from industries
and urban sewerage. Surveillance studies to determine the type and migration of pollution
and measures for
its control have become an absolute necessity from the point of view of
long-term sustainability of ground water resources. Dilution of pollutant concentration through
ground water recharge can be one of the effective ways to mitigate the hazards of high
concentration of these constituents.
It is also desirable that rural water supply schemes be
formulated and arrangements made to utilize fluoride/arsenic rich water for purposes other
than drinking.

Change in highway practice to take the soil of desired strength from other places leaves no
scope to have local natural ditches by road sides augmenting ground water recharge.
It
is
essential and will most certainly be encouraging to use storm water drain outflow that is free
from pollution to pass through a series of artificial recharge pits/wells by the road sides or at
other suitable places through a network of tertiary, secondary and primary drains.
There are several urban areas in the country where water supply systems are based mainly
on ground water resource. Sustainability of urban water supply
is one of the core issues
the planners across the country are facing at present. The problem may get aggravated
in
near future with the rapid pace of urbanization being witnessed
in
India. Potable drinking
water
is an important input for providing municipal supply to the urban complexes. Due to
steep increase in population, the stress on ground water system has increased tremendously
resulting
in steep water level declines in and around these cities. These problems could be
solved to some extent by
i)
Rain Water Harvesting
- The principle of "catch rain water where
it falls".
ii)
Shifting
of ground water pumpage from
the
center
of the
cities
to
the
floodplain areas having proven capabilities of sustaining high yielding tube
wells wherever possible,
iii)
Recycling and reuse of water,
iv)
Dual water supply/disposal systems

10.2
Storm Water Management & Benefits of Ground Water Recharge
The storm water during rainy season causes drainage problem and often roads are damaged
by rainfall runoff. This problem is serious in big cities and industries, where most of the open
area is covered by roads or some concrete structures without proper drainage. The water on
roads during rains remains stagnant for hours together due to poor storm water management
and results into damage of roads. In our country, industries and cities are facing water crises
due to over exploitation of ground water and no provision for recharge of aquifers. Declining
water tables are also responsible for consumption of more energy
in
lifting the water and
reduction in green coverage.
Solution of managing storm water on roads in urban and industrial areas lies in channelizing
the surface runoff to ground water system in a hygienic manner. This method not only helps
in controlling the devastating effects of storm water, but also improve ground water regime
both in terms of rising of water table and increase in ground water availability. The techniques
will also increase life of roads and reduce cost on maintenance and repairs. Besides, better
plant growth
is envisaged with less water requirement due to moist condition of surface soil
107

through percolation structures. The following benefits can be accrued due to ground water
recharge:
•
Reduction in runoff which chokes storm drains.
•
No flooding of roads and increase in
life of roads.
•
Augmentation
of ground water storage and
control
of decline
of water
levels.
»
Improvement of quality of ground water.
•
Reduction of soil erosion.
•
Surviving water requirement during summer in cities and industrial areas.
•
Increase in plantation, and maintaining eco-balance
In designing ground water recharging system, capturing
rainfall runoff from the roads and
creating artificial connectivity to sub-surface water in a hygienic manner is the key concept.
The effectiveness
of the concept
lies
in reasonable
cost, coverage
of large areas and
immediate implementation, reducing the cost of maintenance and repairs of roads and many
fold increase
in
life of road. Storm water harvesting from drainage along both the sides of
roads with the help of suitable, simple structures, would not only control storm water hazards
in cities, but will enhance ground water availability 8 to 10 times more compared to natural
process of rainfall infiltration. The location and design of sustainable ground water recharging
system require hydro geological study of the area as well as sub surface investigation of
most permeable zone. Besides, average rainfall and
rainfall intensity need to be analysed
as per climatic zones. Based on normal rainfall and peak rainfall intensity, the ground water
recharging system
is designed in such a way that 70-80 % runoff of roads and paved area is
sent back to ground water regime after natural filtration process based on rate of recharge.
Recharge
test on
existing
wells/pits must be
carried
out before the commencement of
project.
10.3
Artificial Recharge of Ground Water
The term
artificial recharge has
different connotations
for various
practitioners.
Artificial
recharge of ground water is defined as the recharge that occurs when the natural pattern of
recharge
is deliberately modified to increase recharge rate. The process of recharge
itself
is not artificial. The same physical laws govern recharge, whether
it occurs under natural or
artificial conditions. What is artificial
is the availability of water supply at a particular location
and a
particular time.
In the broadest sense, one can define
artificial recharge as "any
procedure, which introduces water in a pervious stratum". The term artificial recharge refers
to transfer of surface water to the aquifer by human interference. The natural process of
recharging the aquifers is accelerated through percolation of stored or flowing surface water,
which otherwise does not percolate into the aquifers. Artificial recharge is also defined as the
process by which ground water is augmented at a rate exceeding that under natural condition
of replenishment.
Therefore, any man-made facility that adds water to an aquifer may be considered as artificial
recharge.
108



======================================================================
PAGE 117 of 148
======================================================================
IRC:SP:42-2014
Artificial recharge can also be defined as a process of induced replenishment of the ground
water reservoir by human activities. The process of supplementing may be either planned
such as storing water in pits, tanks etc. for feeding the aquifer or unplanned and incidental to
human activities like applied irrigation, leakages from pipes etc.
10.3.1
Need for artificial recharge
Occurrence of rainfall
in India
is mostly limited to about three months in a year. The natural
recharge to ground water reservoir
is restricted
to this period only
in a major part of the
country.
Artificial recharge techniques aim
at extending the recharge period
in the post-
monsoon season for about three or more months,
resulting
in enhanced sustainability of
ground water sources during the lean season.
In arid regions of the country, rainfall varies between 150 and 600 mm/year with less than 10
rainy days. A major part of the precipitation is received in 3 to 5 major storms lasting only a few
hours. The rates of potential evapo-transpiration (PET) are exceptionally high in these areas,
often ranging from 300 to 1300 mm.
In such cases, the average annual PET is much higher
than the rainfall and the annual water resource planning has to be done by conserving the
rainfall, by storing the available water either in surface or in sub-surface reservoirs.
In areas
where climatic conditions are not favourable for creating surface storage,
artificial recharge
techniques have to be adopted for diverting most of the surface storage to the ground water
reservoirs within the shortest possible time.
In hilly areas, even though the rainfall
is comparatively high, scarcity of water is often felt in
the post-monsoon season, as most of the water available
is lost as surface runoff. Springs,
the major source of water in such terrains, are also depleted during the post monsoon period.
In such areas,
rainwater harnessing and small surface storages at strategic locations
in
the recharge areas of the springs can provide sustainable yields to the springs as well as
enhance the recharge during and after rainy season.
10.3.2
Purposes and principles of artificial recharge
-
From the point of view of artificially storing water for future use, the basic requirement
is to
be able to obtain water in adequate amounts and at the proper times in order to accomplish
this goal. Some schemes involve the impoundment of local storm runoff, which
is collected
in ditches, basins or behind dams, after which
it is placed into the ground.
In other localities,
water
is sometimes brought into the region by pipeline or aqueduct.
In the latter case, the
water is an import and represents an addition to whatever natural water resources occur in
the region. Another approach is to treat and reclaim used water being discharged from sewer
systems or industrial establishments.
In
certain
coastal
areas
of
the
world,
artificial
recharge
systems
for
blocking
inland
encroachment of seawater are in operation. Most of these schemes rely on the injection of
fresh water through wells
in order to build up a pressure barrier that will retard or reverse
encroachment of salt water resulting from excessive withdrawals from the wells.
In such
schemes, most of the injected water is not directly available for use, but serves as a hydraulic
mechanism to allow better use of existing ground water reserves.

10.3.3
Advantages of artificial recharge
Following are the main advantages of artificially recharging the ground water aquifers:
•
No large storage structures needed to store water. Structures required are
small and cost-effective
•
Enhance the dependable yield of wells and hand pumps
•
Negligible losses as compared to losses in surface storages
•
Improved water quality due to dilution of harmful chemicals/salts
•
No adverse effects like inundation of large surface areas and loss of crops
•
No displacement of local population
•
Reduction
in cost of energy for lifting water especially where fall
in ground
water table is substantial
•
Utilizes the surplus surface runoff which otherwise drains off
•
Subsurface storage space is available free of cost
•
It has no adverse social impacts such as displacement of population, loss of
scarce agricultural land etc.
•
Water stored underground
is relatively immune to natural and man-made
catastrophes
10.3.4
Sources of water for ground water recharge
Before undertaking a recharge scheme,
it
is important to
first assess the
availability of
adequate water for recharge. Following are the main sources, which need to be identified
and assessed for adequacy:
•
Precipitation over the demarcated areas e.g. roads, buildings, playground,
parks etc.
•
Large roof areas from where rainwater can be collected and diverted for
recharge
•
Streams/nallas/canals from which surplus water can be diverted for recharge,
without violating the rights of other users
•
Properly treated municipal and industrial wastewaters. This water should be
used only after ascertaining its quality and treatment, if necessary assessment
of the available sources of water would require consideration of the following
factors:
•
Available quantity of water
•
Time for which the water would be available
•
Quality of water and the pre-treatment required
110

Ground Water Recharge Test
The design of recharging is based on average annual rainfall and
its intensity and the intake
capacity of the water by the first aquifer. In order to determine intake capacity of water by the
aquifer, recharge test is to be carried out on an existing bore well/open well. In this test, water
at varying rate is injected
till there is spillover. For example - at an injection rate of 500 liters

In this kind of situation, the percolation pit method would be suitable. In this method, the pits
of suitable dimensions can be made along the roads between side lanes and main road.
These pits may be made along both sides of the road at suitable interval based on estimated
runoff. The
pits should have natural
filtration media of coarse sand, gravels and pebbles
and should be covered with perforated slabs as shown
in Fig. 10.3. The road should have
1 degree slopes towards these pits from the divider.

Quality of Recharging Water
RWH mainly has 3 Cs:
1^* C is for collection, 2"^ C is to make
it clean and the last C is termed
as charging. However, one of the most important criteria for selection of source is the quality of
recharging water. The physical, chemical and biological quality of the recharge water affects
the planning and selection of recharge method. Physical quality of recharge water refers to
the type and amount of suspended solids, temperature, and the amount of entrapped
air
whereas chemical quality refers to type and concentration of dissolved solids and gases.
Biological quality refers to type and concentration of living organisms e.g. bacteria.
Polluted water either by sewage
or
industrial
effluents can be used only
after required
treatment. Growth of algae and bacteria during recharge can cause clogging of infiltration
surfaces which
will reduce the
efficiency of the recharged system and may lead
to the
production of gases that further hinder recharge rate. Although surface spreading removes

most bacteria and algae by filtration before the recharge water reaches the aquifer, surface
clogging can reduce the infiltration rate considerably. Injection of water containing bacteria
and algae through wells
is generally not recommended because
it causes clogging of well
screens or aquifer materials, which
is difficult and costly to remedy. A typical recharge tank
with desilting device is shown in Fig. 10.7.

Discharge computation by rational method
a)
Mean co-efficient of runoff
Since the drain
is carrying runoff from half the roadway width and 30 m width of agricultural
land, the mean runoff coefficient from the different surfaces (as per the figure) shall be
= (0.9 X 7 X L + 0.3 X 6 X L + 0.4 X 30 X L)/(7L + 6L +30L) = 0.46
where,
L is the length of road under consideration and the runoff coefficients from different
surfaces from Table 6.5 are:
^-
Bituminous pavement surface - 0.9
Turfed shoulder - 0.3
'
-
Agricultural land with loamy soil - 0.4
b)
Time of Concentration (T) in Minutes
The hydro logically remotest point in the given section of road is the end point of the agricultural
land (with 5 percent slope) and the time required for water to reach the drain from the remotest
point is
T
^ = 30A/ = 500 sec = 8.33 min.
Taking K = 0.274 (from Table 6.6), and S = 0.05, V = 0.06 m/s (V = KxS^^)
Assuming a mean velocity of 0.3 m/s in the unlined drain
T2 = L/0.3sec = L/18min
T = T1+T2 ^ (^-^^
hence L = (T - 8.33) x 18 m
. The lengths for different
values of T are:

Design Rainfall Intensity -
1 (in cm/sec)
From iso-pluvial map of the given sub-zone (CWC Flood Estimation report) in which the road
lies,
it is found that 24 hour rainfall of 50 year return period in the area
is 236 mm and from
Table 6.2, corresponding
1 hour rainfall of 50 year return period
is 39 percent of 24 hour
rainfall. So,
1 hour rainfall of 50 year return period
is 0.39 x 236 = 92 mm = 9.2 cm/hour i.e.
I _ = 9.2 cm/hour.

For a length of drain L = 30 m
T = 10 min - From (b) above and
The ratio of 10 min. rainfall to 60 min rainfall
is 2.85- from Table 6.1
Design
rainfall
intensity for L = 30 m,
1^^ = 2.85 x 9.2 = 26.2 cm/hour for 50 year return
period.
From frequency analysis of available rainfall data at the given place, the following conversion
factors for other return periods and the design rainfall for L = 30 m and T = 10 min. are found
to be as follows:

Computation of Drain Section (by using IVIanning's Equation, See 7.2.1)
(For 30 m Length of Drain, Bottom width
= 0.6 m, T = 10 min)
'<
Corresponding to 10 year return period, Q^^ = 0.029 cumec,
For the given
soil with
little vegetative growth
(well maintained), assume n = 0.03 -From
Table 7.1,
Permissible maximum velocity, V^g^= 0.9 m/sec- from Table 7.1, Bed slope, S=0.01, Side
Slope-2:1, m = 2
Let d be the depth of flow in the drain bed in m
Area of flow section,
= (B^ + md)d = (0.6 + 2d)d
Wetted Perimeter, P = [B^ +2 (m^ +
1 )d] = 0.6 + 2V5 d
Hydraulic Radius, R = A/P = (0.6 + 2d)d/(0.6 + 2V5 d)
Using Manning's Formula, Q = (1/n) A^ R^'^ s^'^ and Q = 0.029
0.029 = (1/0.03) X (0.6d + 2d)d x [(0.6 + 2d)d/(0.6 + 2V5 d)f ^ x O.Or'^
Solving the above equation by trial, d = 0.08 m = 8 cm and V = MnR^'^ S^'^= 0.55 m/s < 0.9
m/s, o.k.
With a minimum of 10 cm freeboard, the minimum depth of the drain below
its top should
be 18 cm.
Check for Flow Condition in the drain
i
As mentioned
in Section 7.2, flow in open drain should be at sub-critical state. For this the
;
Froude's number of flow should be less than
1, preferably below 0.7 above which the flow
surface becomes wavy. Froude's No. Fr = V/V(g D), where D = A/T and T = B^ + 2 md = 0.6
!
+ 2 X 2 X .08 = 0.92 m, A^ = (0.6 + 2 x .08) x .08 = .0608
i
D = .0608/.92 = 0.066 m, V = 0.55 m/s, Fr = 0.55/V(9.8 x .08) = 0.62 < 0.7 o.k.
|
Drain sections for other different lengths (L) and corresponding values
of, T,
I, Q can be
found in the same manner as illustrated above.
Example-2
: A concrete road side gutter of triangular section
is to be designed for a design
= 0.03 cumec.
If the road section has a cross- slope of 2.5 percent (1
in 40 i.e. Z = 40) and
longitudinal grade
is
1
in 100 (S = 0.01). Determine the flow depth and flow encroachment
on the road.
