CODE OF PRACTICE FOR MAINTENANCE OF 
BITUMINOUS ROAD SURFACES 
1  INTRODUCTION
“Code of Practice for Maintenance of Bituminous Road Surface” was first published in 1982. 
To cater for the technological developments which were taking place in course of time the 
Road Maintenance & Asset Management Committee (H-6) formed a sub-group consisting 
of Dr. P.K. Jain, Dr. S.S. Jain, Shri K. Sitaramanjaneyulu and Shri M.N. Nagabhushana for 
the revision of the document. The H-6 Committee deliberated on revised draft document 
prepared by the sub-group, in a series of meetings. Finally the H-6 Committee approved the 
draft “Code of Practice for Maintenance of Bituminous Road Surfaces” in its meeting held on 
24th November, 2014.The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) approved 
the draft document in its meeting held on 12th January, 2015. The Council in its 204th meeting 
held at Bhubaneshwar (Odisha) approved IRC:82-2015 “Code of Practice for Maintenance of 
Bituminous Road Surface” after taking on board the comments offered by the members.

SECTION 2
SCOPE
2.1	
By early detection of distress and appropriate repair of bituminous surface at initial 
stages, further deterioration of the pavement surface can be prevented or delayed. This Code 
of Practice deals with the “Routine”, “Preventive” and “Periodic” maintenance of bituminous 
surfaces. 
2.2 
Several phases are involved in undertaking maintenance operations for bituminous 
surfaces as discussed in subsequent sections. Section 3 and 4 deals with importance and 
types of maintenance. Maintenance planning and system approach to pavement maintenance 
are described in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Types of pavement distresses, identification, 
severity, their causes, and methods of treatment are given in Section 7. 
2.3	
Preventive maintenance is the need of the day and is described in Section 8. Periodic 
renewals are covered in Section 9. Sections, 10, 11, 12, and 13 deal with the materials and 
methods for rectification, tools and equipment, arrangements for traffic, and organization and 
management, respectively. 
2.4 
Operations falling in the category of pavement rehabilitation and strengthening are 
beyond the scope of this Code of Practice. For design of rehabilitation and strengthening 
measures for existing pavements, reference may be made to the following publications:

Beam Deflection Technique” 
ii) 
IRC:37 “Tentative Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements”
iii) 
IRC:115 “Guidelines for Structural Evaluation and Strengthening of Flexible Pavement 
using Falling Weight Deflectometer”
SECTION 3
IMPORTANCE OF MAINTENANCE
3.1 
The timely upkeep and maintenance of bituminous surfacing offers numerous benefits 
for preservation of road asset. The importance of overall maintenance is described below:
i)	
Reduction in rate of deterioration and improvement in life of road 
ii) 
Reduction in Vehicle Operation Costs (VOC)
iii)	
Reduction in rate of accidents 
iv) 
Keeping roads traffic worthy in all weathers
v)	
Reduction in pollution due to reduced fuel consumption on well maintained pavement 
surface
vi) 
Savings in budgetary expenditure of restoration/ reconstruction 
3.2 
Timely and regular maintenance of roads have been known to provide economic 
rate of return as high as 15 to 20 percent depending upon the category of road and traffic 
volume. Moreover, it helps in deferring the demand for rehabilitation which otherwise is far 
more costlier than preventive maintenance. Therefore, timely and appropriate maintenance 
of bituminous surface using sustainable/suitable materials and methods is significant for 
preservation of road asset and to serve the intended purpose.  
SECTION 4
TYPES OF MAINTENANCE
4.1 
Maintenance operations covered in this Code of Practice are classified into three 
broad categories
a)	
Routine Maintenance: This covers items such as filling of potholes, repairing of 
cracks and patch work, which are undertaken by the maintenance staff almost 
round the year. Routine maintenance is also required for pavement markings on the 
bituminous surfaces to guide the road users and improve road safety.



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 81
======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
4
b)	
Preventive Maintenance: The preventive maintenance is performed to improve or 
extend the functional life of pavement surface while in good condition. This may 
defer the need of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation.
c)	
Periodic Maintenance: This includes regular maintenance operations compared 
to preventive maintenance such as applying a renewal coat, which are required to 
be carried out periodically at the specified frequency or based upon condition and 
performance of road surface depending upon category of road, traffic and climatic 
conditions.
SECTION 5
PLANNING OF MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
5.1	
All types of pavement maintenance need a comprehensive maintenance program. 
Following guidelines are to be considered in planning of routine, preventive and periodic 
maintenance activities.
The first step towards planning of maintenance operations is the evaluation of the existing 
pavement surface in terms of its physical condition as well as structural capacity. For this 
purpose, pavement condition surveys may be undertaken by the visual assessment of the 
surface by identifying type, location and magnitude of the distress as described in Appendix -1 
and recorded in a standard format as in Proforma 1, in order to decide time as well as type 
of maintenance treatment to be given. In case more precise condition data is required in 
project level based maintenance strategies, then surface distress may be recorded by actual 
measurements as described in Appendix – 2 and recorded in a standard format as given in 
Proforma 2. The rating of pavement may be assigned as per criteria given in Tables 5.1 to 
5.3 for different categories of roads.

In some situations, there is a likelihood of a particular distress falling in one rating category, 
say good, while some other distress falls in a different rating category, say fair or poor. In 
order to obtaining/assigning the overall rating in such circumstances, based on an appropriate 
weightage with regard to the significance of a particular distress, a methodology has been 
proposed and given in Appendix-4.
5.2	
Apart from visual surveys, functional evaluation of pavement based on riding quality 
(i.e. road roughness), deflection and skid resistance should also form the basis for taking 
maintenance decisions in case of highways and urban roads. Skid resistance is an important 
parameter from the angle of ensuring enhanced safe movement of vehicles, especially 
during wet weather conditions. Lower skid number invites safety hazards and would require 
immediate attention. The serviceability indicators for consideration of maintenance and taking 
appropriate decisions are given in Tables 5.4 and 5.5. The serviceability indicators for level 
1, 2 and 3 are to be read in conjunction with the distresses as given in Table 5.1 for highways 
and Table 5.3 for urban roads.

Note: Level 1 is expected to match with new pavement condition, level 2 is the in-service 
minimum desirable level and level 3 is the warrant for intervention to restore the pavement 
condition to level 1. 
5.3	
Necessary information about the routine maintenance requirement shall be readily 
available with the maintenance staff who are expected to be continuously in the knowledge 
of the physical condition of the road surface. However, for preventive and periodic renewal 
requirement or short term/long term maintenance strategies, condition surveys are carried 
out at a fixed frequency. Keeping this in view, it is desirable that at least two condition surveys 
are conducted every year on each stretch , first before and the second after the monsoon 
in case of highways and urban roads. Minimum one condition survey is required for other 
roads, preferably after monsoon. Generally, the condition surveys are carried out from a 
vehicle travelling at a speed of 5 km/hour supplemented by inspection of the critical locations 
by walking. The data collected should be recorded methodically, kilometer wise. It is desirable 
that these visual surveys are carried out by a team of experienced engineers at a responsible 
level. Condition survey may be conducted by automated survey vehicles also.
Based on the condition survey data, the causes for the development of various distresses/ 
defects shall be examined in detail as described in Section 7 and a decision shall be taken 
whether to initiate or defer the maintenance activity, or to go in for more detailed structural 
investigations to determine the rehabilitation needs, if necessary. Type of maintenance activity 
to be undertaken shall depend upon condition rating, as per Tables 5.1 to 5.3. 
Where severity of distress on the pavement has reached the level which adversely influences 
the riding quality significantly and affects smooth flow of traffic, these should be rectified 
straightway by providing appropriate maintenance treatment. For other defects like minor

IRC:82-2015

cracking, and ravelling, optimal preventive strategy should be adopted having regard to the 
various factors such as finances available, and a decision taken whether to go in for preventive 
maintenance measures like sealing, application of periodic renewal or strengthening. In other 
words, the planning of the various maintenance operations should be correlated and looked 
upon as a total system rather than each activity being considered in isolation. 
A plan has to be drawn for preventive maintenance or periodic renewals depending upon 
pavement condition rating as given in Tables 5.1 to 5.3. Once the overall maintenance plan 
has been drawn up, attention should be given to the proper organization and management 
aspects of the programme including deployment of various resources, i.e. men, materials 
and equipment, in an efficient manner. For each maintenance activity, the work at site should 
be carefully controlled so that the optimum output and quality are achieved. 
In case of rural roads, periodic renewal treatments may be decided when condition rating 
reaches to a value of 2 to 1. However, in case of highways and urban roads, periodic renewal 
may be undertaken at a serviceability level of 2. Preventive maintenance shall be undertaken 
before pavement rating drops to 2. 
Condition surveys may be undertaken/carried out visually (Appendix 1) and supplemented 
with actual measurements where needed (Appendix 2) or using instrumented vehicles 
(Appendix 3). 
Modern trend is to use instrumented system for assessment of pavement condition since 
these are more accurate and faster. It is recommended that condition assessment of 
highways be carriedout using instrumented system. The description of the equipments used 
for measuring pavement condition in terms of distress, roughness, skid resistance etc. are 
given in Appendix 3.
SECTION 6
SYSTEM APPROACH TO PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE
6.1	
Pavement Maintenance Management System (PMMS) is a technical or operational 
methodology for managing or directing and controlling maintenance resources, in a scientific 
manner, for optimum benefits. It is a complex problem of matching of resources, time, materials, 
labour, equipment, funds, design and, above all decision making, whereas, Pavement 
Management System (PMS) consists of a comprehensive, coordinated set of activities 
associated with the planning, design, construction, maintenance, evaluation and research of 
pavements. A major objective of PMS is to assist the highway engineer in making consistent 
and cost effective decisions related to the construction, maintenance and rehabilitation of 
pavements.

6.2  	
The Pavement Maintenance Management System performs the following functions:
i)	
To identify projects in need of Maintenance & Repairs (M&R) and to establish 
priorities
ii) 
Identification of the type of maintenance and/or rehabilitation required 
iii)	
Requirement of type and timing of future M&R
iv) 
To minimise life-cycle costs or maximise benefits 
v)	
To predict performance of pavement in future
6.3	
The prime purpose of maintenance phase in a Pavement Management System is 
to determine the cost associated with providing various level-of-serviceability for any given 
pavement. This is an important feedback to planning, design and construction. The type and 
degree of maintenance can also influence the rate and serviceability loss for a pavement. It is 
clear that maintenance management requires careful planning and implementation, efficient 
reporting of maintenance practices and problems. Hence, maintenance management is 
primarily managing the resources to provide an agreed level-of-service.
SECTION 7
TYPES OF PAVEMENT DISTRESS, IDENTIFICATION, SYMPTOMS, 
LOCATION, CAUSES, SEVERITY LEVELS AND TREATMENT 
7.1	
General: The types of defects in bituminous surfacing are grouped under four 
categories. 
i)	
Surface Defects: These include fatty surface, smooth surface, streaking, and hungry 
surface 
ii)	
Cracks : These include all types of cracks, viz, hair-line cracks, alligator cracks, 
longitudinal cracks, edge cracks, shrinkage cracks, and reflection cracks 
iii)	
Deformation: These include rutting, corrugations, shoving including those caused 
by layer slippage , shallow depressions, settlements and upheavals etc.
iv)	
Disintegration: These include stripping, loss of aggregates, ravelling, potholes, and 
edge breaking
The location and severity of distress are important to select appropriate maintenance 
treatments, materials and technique.

7.2	
Surface Defects: These are confined to surfacing and may be due to inappropriate 
quality and quantity of bitumen. 
7.2.1	
Bleeding or Fatty Surface
7.2.1.1	 Symptoms
A surface having a thin film of excess or free bituminous binder on it, which creates a shiny, 
glass like reflecting surface tending to become soft in hot weather and slippery in cold and 
wet weather, eventually developing low skid resistance is referred to as bleeding or fatty 
bituminous surface. 
7.2.1.2	 Location
Generally such defects develop along the wheel path but sometimes these are restricted 
to isolated locations and specific lanes. Many a time, these defects are seen on the entire 
carriageway.
7.2.1.3	 Causes 
Bleeding occurs in hot weather, when the bituminous binder after filling the available voids in 
compacted bituminous layer moves upward under traffic movement and collects as a thick 
film on the surface. The process is not reversible during cold weather, leading to permanent 
accumulation of binder on the surface with passage of time making the surface fatty, slippery 
and skid prone. This can be caused by one or combination of the following factors:
i) 
Excessive binder in hot mix due to faulty mix design or lapses in quality control 
ii) 
Lower voids in hot mix
iii)	
Use of softer grade binder
iv) 
Too heavy tack coat or prime coat
v)	
Loss of cover aggregates in surface dressing
vi) 
Excessive application of binder or non-uniform spreading of cover aggregate or flaky/
elongated cover aggregate in surface dressing 
7.2.1.4	 Severity levels
A fatty surface may have different degree of severity depending upon reasons thereof. The 
severity of fatty surface and bleeding may be classified as low, medium and extensive. The 
isolated spots measuring less than 5 m2 area in a lane km and restricted to only specific lane 
with total area less than 1% may be considered as bleeding/ fatty surface of low severity. 
Sometimes bleeding/fatty surface is confined to entire lane along with wheel path. In case 
the area is in the range of 1 to 5%, it may be treated as fatty surface/ bleeding of medium

severity. Extensive bleeding and fatty surface showing initiation of shoving shall be treated as 
fatty surface of “High Severity”. Photos 7.2.1, (a,b,c) indicate low, medium and high severity 
level of bleeding and fatty surface respectively.
  
	
	
(a) Low severity	
(b) Medium severity	
 (c) High severity 
Photo 7.2.1 Bleeding
7.2.1.5	 Treatment
a) Low Severity: Minor bleeding/low severity fatty surface can be corrected by applying 
heated coarse sand (passing 1.18 mm sieve) to blot up excess bitumen in affected area 
followed by light rolling.
b) Medium Severity: Medium severity bleeding and fatty surface may be corrected by 
application of pre-coated chips; Passing 4.75 mm and retained over 1.18 mm using 1 % 
bitumen and generally applied in a single layer followed by light rolling. In case the layer of 
bleeding is less than 1 mm, treatment described for low severity would be sufficient. 
c) High Severity: The affected portion shall be milled out and repaired with mix of desired 
quality. The milled material i.e. Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) mixed with fresh aggregates 
may be laid followed by application of slurry seal/ microsurfacing treatment. An open-graded 
premix carpet with low bitumen content can also be applied to absorb the excess binder. In 
the case of large areas of fatty surface, having irregularities, removal of the affected layer 
and replacing it with a layer of properly designed mix, may be necessary. 
7.2.2	
Smooth Surface 
7.2.2.1	 Symptoms 
A smooth surface has a low skid resistance and becomes very slippery when it is wet. 
Such a condition invites safety hazards, especially on gradients, bends, and intersections, 
Photo 7.2.2 indicates a smooth surface.

Photo 7.2.2 A View of Smooth Surface
7.2.2.2	 Location
Smooth surface may be restricted to a lane/carriageway.
7.2.2.3	 Causes
A primary cause for a smooth surface is the polishing of aggregates under traffic. Excessive 
binder can also contribute to formation of smooth surface. 
7.2.2.4	 Severity Levels
The severity level of smooth surface may be defined by skid number. A surface with skid 
number in the range of 30 to 40 indicates low severity smooth surface while skid number 
below 30 indicates high severity smooth surface. 
7.2.2.5	 Treatment
The rectification consists of resurfacing with a surface dressing course or a premix carpet or 
microsurfacing depending upon the type of existing surface. Care should be taken to select 
aggregates which have proven non-polishing characteristics. The carpet can be an open 
graded mix. A slurry seal can also be used to impart anti skid texture on a smooth surface. 
7.2.3	
Streaking 
7.2.3.1	 Symptoms
Streaking is characterized by the appearance of alternate lean and heavy lines of bitumen 
either in longitudinal direction or a transverse direction. Photo 7.2.3.shows streaking.

Photo 7.2.3 Streaking of Bituminous Pavement
7.2.3.2	 Location 
Streaking may occur in a lane or a carriageway. 
7.2.3.3	 Causes
Longitudinal streaking results when alternate longitudinal strips of surface contain different 
quantities of bitumen due to non-uniform application of bitumen across the surface. Some of 
the more common causes of streaking are mechanical faults, improper or poor adjustment 
and operation of bitumen distributors. These streaks can also be formed as a result of 
applying the bituminous binder at too low temperature; a temperature at which bitumen is 
not fluid enough to be delivered in a uniform and smooth flow from the nozzles on the spray 
bars. All these causes can result in transverse streaking also. Transverse streaking may also 
be caused by spurts in the bitumen spray from the distribution spray bar. These could be as 
a result of mechanical faults in the bitumen distributor. Transverse streaking may result in 
corrugation in the pavement surface. 
7.2.3.4	 Severity Levels
Not applicable
7.2.3.5	 Treatment 
The satisfactory repair for longitudinal and transverse streaking is to remove the streaked 
surface and apply a new surface. It is always desirable to prevent longitudinal and transverse 
streaking than to correct it. Whenever mechanical equipment is used for spraying of bitumen, 
distributor should be carefully operated.
7.2.4	
Hungry Surface 
7.2.4.1	 Symptoms 
Hungry surface is characterized by the loss of fine aggregates from the surface or the 
appearance of dry surface with fine cracks; Photos 7.2.4 indicate a dry and hungry surface

Photo 7.2.4 View of Dry and Hungry Surface
7.2.4.2	 Location 
Hungry surface may be in full lane or carriageway.
7.2.4.3	 Causes 
One of the reasons for hungry surface is the use of less bitumen in the surfacing. Sometimes, 
this condition may also appear due to use of absorptive aggregates in the surfacing. 
7.2.4.4	 Severity Levels 
Not applicable 
7.2.4.5	 Treatment 
Fog seal / liquid rejuvenating materials may be used for correction of dry and hungry surface. 
Slurry seal or microsurfacing may also be used as a repair measure, when applied in an 
average thickness of 2-4 mm. 
7.3	
Cracks
7.3.1	
General 
Cracking of bituminous surfacing is a common distress seen on majority of roads in India (with 
the passage of time). Cracks in bituminous surface are classified into various types depending 
upon severity. Immediate attention must be given for sealing of cracks, and prevention of 
their further widening as ingress of water through cracks is detrimental to pavement structure 
and performance of bituminous surfacing.
7.3.2	
Hairline Cracks
7.3.2.1	 Symptoms
Hairline cracks are present in narrow area and their width is less than one mm (Photo 7.3.1). 
Hairline cracks are generally isolated and normally these are not interconnected. These 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:82-2015

appear as short and fine cracks at close intervals on the surface. Many a time, such cracks 
disappear in hot summer. 
 
Photo 7.3.2 Hairline Cracks
7.3.2.2	 Location 
These cracks may be at isolated places or in a lane/carriageway.
7.3.2.3	 Causes
These cracks develop due to either insufficient bitumen content, excessive filler, improper 
compaction, oxidation of bitumen in surface or sometimes excessive moisture in granular 
layers. These may occur due to rolling of mix while it is still tender or due to excessive 
compaction. 
7.3.2.4	 Severity Levels 
Not applicable
7.3.2.5	 Treatment 
These cracks may be treated by fog seal, application of liquid rejuvenating agents, slurry 
sealing and microsurfacing.
7.3.3	
Alligator and Map Cracking
7.3.3.1	 Symptoms 
Alligator or map cracking is characterized as a series of interconnected cracks, having small 
irregular blocks in pavement surface which resemble the skin of an alligator. These cracks 
may be of different types depending upon extent and severity. The size of irregular shape 
blocks of cracks vary from less than 30 cm to more. 
7.3.3.2	 Location 
Alligator or map cracks normally appear along the wheel path. 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
15
7.3.3.3	 Causes 
The causes of alligator cracking are many. These are developed due to one or more of the 
following reasons.
i) 
Excessive deflection of pavement surface normally in wheel paths.
ii) 
Inadequate pavement thickness.
iii) 
Weakening of sub-grade or lower layers of the pavement due to ingress of excessive 
moisture to pavement and saturation.
iv) 
Overloading of heavy commercial vehicles.
v)	
Brittleness of binder due to ageing of binder and lowering of surface temperature due 
to weather conditions.
vi)	
Stripping of underlying bituminous courses
7.3.3.4	 Severity Level 
Alligator cracking may be classified as low severity, medium severity and high severity.
(Photos 7.3.3-a,b,c.)
Low Severity: Low severity cracks are characterized by an area of cracking with very narrow 
cracks with almost no additional deterioration of the surface. The cracking is often isolated 
and many times, the cracking may not be interconnected to other areas and there is not 
much distortion. The depth and width of such cracks is in the range of 1 to 3 mm. 
Medium Severity: Medium severity-cracking is characterized by interconnected cracks 
forming a small area similar to the skin of an alligator. The cracks may have signs of 
slight spalling, with no pumping visible. The depth and width of such cracks lies between 
3 to 6 mm.

======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 81
======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
16
High Severity: High Severity alligator cracking is characterized by an area of moderate to 
severely spalled interconnected cracks creating a full pattern of cracking similar to the skin of 
an alligator. The width and depth in this case may be more than 6 mm. Pieces of bituminous 
surface may be loose or missing. The pumping of water and fine material below the pavement 
may be seen on the surface.
7.3.3.5	 Treatment 
In order to repair a pavement affected by alligator cracking, the main cause of the 
cracking should be determined. However, often the specific cause is fairly deep seated. Any 
investigation should involve digging a pit or coring the pavement to determine the pavements 
structural adequacy/ability as well as determining whether or not subsurface moisture is 
a contributing factor. The repair needed is also based on the severity and extent of the 
cracking. Treatment of alligator cracking may be done by following the methods depending 
upon their severity.
a) 
Crack sealing by bitumen emulsions 
b) 
Crack sealing by rubberized and modified bitumen 
c)	
Milling and surface recycling 
In case of a pavement being structurally inadequate or weak, a properly designed overlay 
based on evaluation shall be provided
7.3.4	
Longitudinal Cracking
7.3.4.1	 Symptoms 
Cracks that appear parallel to the centerline or along the road are called longitudinal cracks. 
These cracks are also sometimes source of onset of alligator cracking.

IRC:82-2015
17
7.3.4.2	 Location 
These cracks may appear at joints between two paving lanes or between pavement and 
paved shoulders.
7.3.4.3	 Causes 
Longitudinal cracks in bituminous pavement are usually caused by alternate wetting and 
drying beneath the shoulder surface or by improper/weak joint between adjoining layers of 
pavement.
7.3.4.4	 Severity Level 
Severity of longitudinal cracks may be defined as low, medium and high. (Photos 7.3.4: a, b 
and c). The low severity is assigned to 1-3 mm wide and infrequent cracks medium severity 
is assigned to 3-6 mm wide. High Severity is assigned to cracks greater than 6 mm wide and 
are frequent (numerous).
7.3.4.5	 Treatment
Treatment for longitudinal cracks depend upon the severity and extent of the cracking :
a)	
Low and medium Severity Cracks: Crack sealing, preferably using rubberised 
bitumen
b)	
High Severity Cracks: Remove and replace the cracked pavement layer with fresh 
overlay.
7.3.5	
Transverse Cracks
7.3.5.1	 Symptoms 
These cracks appear in the transverse directions or as interconnected cracks forming series 
of large blocks perpendicular to the direction of the road.

18
7.3.5.2	 Location 
Transverse cracks may occur at isolated locations or in a lane/ carriageway. 
7.3.5.3	 Causes
Transverse cracking may occur due to reflection of crack or joint in an underlying pavement 
layer. The low temperature brittleness or oxidation of bitumen and also structural failure at 
concrete base course are also causes of such cracking. Transverse cracks are usually formed 
due to shrinkage of bituminous mix on account of low temperature.
7.3.5.4	 Severity Level 
Severity of transverse cracks may be defined as low, medium and high (Photos 7.3.5: a, b 
and c). The low severity is assigned to 1-3 mm wide and infrequent cracks.  Medium severity 
is assigned to 3-6 mm wide cracks. High Severity is assigned to cracks greater than 6 mm 
wide and are frequent (numerous).
7.3.5.5	 Treatment 
Transverse cracks may be treated using slurry seal or rubberised bitumen.  
7.3.6 
Edge Cracking 
7.3.6.1	 Symptoms
Edge cracking is defined as cracks which develop parallel to outer edge of the pavement. 
7.3.6.2	 Location
The location of edge cracking is normally 0.3 to 0.5 m inside of pavement edge.
 	
	
(a) Low severity 	
(b) Medium severity	
(c) High severity
Photo 7.3.6 Edge Cracking
7.3.6.3	 Causes 
The causes of edge cracking are many. Lack of lateral support from shoulder, settlement 
underlying the bituminous layers, inadequate surface drainage, shrinkage in sub-grade soil, 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
19
inadequate pavement width near curves, inferior quality material in shoulders and thinner 
bituminous surface at edge of the pavement and wet sub-grade are some of the reasons for 
edge cracking.
7.3.6.4	 Severity Level
The severity levels of edge cracks are low, medium and high (Photos 7.3.6: a,b and c). Low 
severity is with no breakup or loss of material, medium severity is with some breakup and 
loss of material (upto 10% of the affected length) while high severity is with considerable 
breakup and loss of material (more than 10% of the affected length).
7.3.6.5	 Treatment 
The following procedure/techniques are used for prevention or treatment of edge 
cracking:
i) 
Promote good drainage along the edge of the road. Make sure that surface water will 
run to the nearby drain and not pond along the pavement edge.
ii)	
Remove the dirty, poor draining shoulder material and replace it with a more permeable 
material.
iii) 
If truck traffic is substantial, place a considerably thick structural overlay on the 
road surface of the order of 75-100 mm of hot mix to provide adequate support for 
heavier vehicle loads.
7.3.7	
Reflection Cracking 
7.3.7.1	 Symptoms
Reflection cracks are the sympathetic cracks that appear in the bituminous surfacing over 
joints and underneath cracked pavement. The pattern may be longitudinal, transverse, 
diagonal or block.
Photo 7.3.7 Reflection Cracking 



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 81
======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
20
7.3.7.2	 Location 
Reflection cracking occurs most frequently in bituminous overlays on cement concrete 
pavements, or on cement soil bases. They may also occur in overlays or surfacing on flexible 
pavements where cracks in the old existing pavement have not been properly rectified. 
Another condition under which reflection cracks can occur is when a pavement is widened. 
The location of the cracks will then be exactly on the junction between the old pavement and 
the widened portion. Reflection cracks may allow water to enter the underlying pavement and 
the sub grade and cause further damage to pavement. 
7.3.7.3	 Causes 
Differential movement across the underlying crack or joint is responsible for development of 
reflection cracking. For joint reflection cracking, this is movement of the cement concrete slab 
beneath the bituminous surface because of the thermal and moisture changes.
7.3.7.4	 Severity Levels
Not applicable
7.3.7.5	 Treatment 
The treatment, for all types of cracks discussed above, would depend on whether the 
pavement is structurally sound, or has become distorted or unsound. In case the pavement 
is structurally sound, then the cracks should be filled with a bituminous binder having a 
low viscosity so that it can be poured and worked into the cracks. Cut-back bitumen and 
emulsions are generally suitable. Rubberised bitumen meeting the requirements of ASTM D 
5078 may also be used. All loose materials are removed from the cracks with brooms and, if 
necessary, with compressed air jetting. The binder is poured with a pouring can and a hand 
squeegee is used to assist the penetration of the binder into the cracks. Light sanding of the 
cracks is then done to prevent traffic picking of the binder.
If the cracks are wide enough, a slurry seal or sand bituminous premix patching can be 
used to seal the cracks. If the cracks are fine and extend over large areas, a light cut-back 
or an emulsified bitumen (fog seal) can be broomed into the cracks and lightly sanded to 
prevent the picking up of the binder by the traffic. Stress Absorbing Membrane (SAM) or 
Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) may be used to seal reflection cracking and 
prevention of occurrence. 
7.4	
Deformation 
Deformation may be restricted to one or more layers of bituminous courses or may extend 
to entire pavement and sub-grade. A change in the original shape of the pavement surface 
is known as deformation. It may be reflected in the form of slippage, rutting, corrugation, 
shoving, shallow depression and settlement.

7.4.1	
Slippage 
7.4.1.1	 Symptoms
Slippage is the relative movement between the wearing course and the layer beneath the 
bituminous surface. It is characterized by the formation of crescent shaped cracks that point 
in the direction of the thrust of the wheels on the pavement surface. This does not mean that 
the cracks invariably point in the direction of the traffic. For example, if brakes are applied on 
a vehicle going down a hill, the thrust of the wheels will be pointing uphill. The cracks in this 
case will, therefore, point uphill. 
	
              (a) Low	
(b) High	
	
Photo 7.4.1 Slippage of the Bituminous Wearing Coat
7.4.1.2	 Location 
Slippage of bituminous surface normally occurs along the wheel path of heavy vehicles.
7.4.1.3	 Causes
Slippage is caused by unusual thrust of wheels in a specific direction due to omission or 
inadequacy of tack coat, lack of bond between the wearing coat and the lower layer caused 
by a layer of fine dust, moisture or both. Failure of bond between two layers due to excessive 
deflection of the pavement may also be responsible for slippage of wearing coat or successive 
layer.
7.4.1.4	 Severity Level 
Slippage may be classified as low severity and high severity slippage (Photos 7.4.1 : a and 
b). In case, slippage is at isolated locations in a lane, it is classified as low severity slippage. 
In case, slippage is along the wheel path in the entire lane or carriageway, it is classified as 
high severity slippage.
7.4.1.5	 Treatment 
Rectification consists of removing the surface layer around the area affected upto the point 
where good bond between the surfacing and the layer underneath exists and patching the 
area with premix material after applying a tack coat.

7.4.2	
Rutting 
7.4.2.1	 Symptoms
Rutting is longitudinal depression or groove in the pavement along the wheel path. Rutting is 
categorized into three types and defined by the cause and layers in which rutting occurs, and 
it can be characterized by two components of the original (initial) pavement profile change, 
which are direct consequences of permanent deformation such as uplift and downward 
deformation. 
	
(a) Low severity	
(b) High severity 
Photo 7.4.2 Rutting in Bituminous Surface 
7.4.2.2	 Location 
Rutting generally appears along the wheel path. 
7.4.2.3	 Causes 
The causes of rutting are the following: 
i) 
Heavy channelized traffic and overloading of vehicles
ii) 
Inadequate compaction of the mix at the surface or in the underlying bituminous 
courses during construction 
iii) 
Improper mix design, lacking in stability to support the traffic 
iv) 
Weak pavement due to poor sub grade and inadequate design 
v) 
Use of soft bitumen or waxy bitumen
vi) 
Intrusion of sub grade clay into granular base course or use of plastic filler in GSB/
WBM/WMM

IRC:82-2015
23
7.4.2.4	 Severity 
Rutting may be classified as low severity when 4-10 mm deep and high severity when more 
than 10 mm (Photos 7.4.2  a and b). 
7.4.2.5	 Treatment 
The rectification consists of filling of ruts with premix (open-graded or dense-graded) patching 
materials and compacting to the desired levels. The locations of depression are first marked 
on the surface and then limits are determined with a string line. After applying a suitable tack 
coat, the premix is spread and compacted.
7.4.3	
Corrugation 
7.4.3.1	 Symptoms
Corrugation is the formation of regular undulations (ripples) across the bituminous surface. 
These are usually shallow (about 25 mm) and are different from the larger depressions 
caused by weakness in the lower layers of the pavement or the sub-grade. The spacing of 
the waves is 2-3 m. The corrugations can be a source of discomfort during driving and can 
become a safety hazard if allowed to become severe. A view of corrugated surface is shown 
in Photo 7.4.3
Photo 7.4.3 Corrugation of Bituminous Surface 
7.4.3.2	 Location
Corrugations may occur near wheel path or in the entire lane or carriageway. 
7.4.3.3	 Causes 
Corrugations occur due to the following reasons: 
i) 
Lack of stability in the mix (excessive binder, high proportion of fines, too round or 
too smooth textured coarse or fine aggregate, too soft binder)



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 81

ii) 
Oscillations set up by the vehicle springs can cause alternative valleys and ridges. 
iii)	
Faulty laying of surface course
iv) 
Insufficient rolling or rolling a tender mix
v) 
Braking action of vehicles on grade especially near intersections
7.4.3.4	 Severity
Not applicable 
7.4.3.5	 Treatment 
If the surface is thin, the same is scarified; including some portions of the underlying base, 
and the scarified material is recompacted. A new surfacing layer is then laid. Cutting of high 
spots with a blade with or without heating and addition of leveling course materials can also 
be resorted to. Spreading of sand bituminous premix with a drag spreader with its blade 
adjusted to just clear the high spots can also be an effective way to make up the corrugation. 
The area is then thoroughly rolled. 
7.4.4	
Shoving 
7.4.4.1	 Symptoms
Shoving is a form of plastic movement within the bituminous layers resulting in bulging of the 
pavement surface. Photo 7.4.4 shown shoving of bituminous layers.
Photo 7.4.4 Shoving of Bituminous Surface 
7.4.4.2	 Location 
Shoving occurs characteristically at points, where traffic starts and stops (intersections, bus-
stops), on hills roads or where vehicles accelerate or brake on grades and on sharp curves. 
The first indication of shoving appears in the form of slippage cracks which are crescent 
shaped cracks, with the apex of the crack pointing in the direction of the shove. Photo 7.4.4 
shows shoving of bituminous layers. Shoving occurs near the wheel path.

the bituminous surface or base course. 
ii) 
Lack of bond between bituminous surface and underlying layer 
iii) 
Heavy traffic movement involving negotiation of curves and gradients 
7.4.4.4	 Severity Level
Not applicable 
7.4.4.5	 Treatment 
The rectification consists of removing the material in the affected area down to a firm base 
and laying a stable premix patch. 
7.4.5	
Shallow Depression 
7.4.5.1	 Symptoms
Shallow depressions are isolated low areas of limited size, dipping about 25 mm or more 
below the profile, where water will normally become stagnant. The shallow depressions may 
or may not be eventually accompanied by cracking of surface. These may also lead to further 
deterioration of the surface and cause discomfort and unsafe surface to traffic. A view of 
shallow depression is shown in Photo 7.4.5 
Photo 7.4.5 Shallow Depression in Bituminous Surface 
7.4.5.2	 Location 
Shallow depressions are generally restricted to wheel path/heavy traffic lanes. 
7.4.5.3	 Causes
Shallow depressions are caused by isolated settlement of lower pavement layers due to 
pockets of inadequately compacted sub grade or subsequent pavement layers.

Settlements and Upheaval 
7.4.6.1	 Symptoms
Settlements and upheavals are characterized by relatively large deformations of the pavement 
compared to shallow depressions. These are dangerous to traffic and cause reduction in 
speed of traffic. These are generally followed by extensive cracks over the pavement surface 
in the affected region. Settlements and upheavals are shown in Photo 7.4.6 and 7.4.7, 
respectively

7.4.6.2	 Location 
Settlement may be along the wheel path or at isolated locations in a lane or carriageway. 
7.4.6.3	 Causes 
The following are the causes for settlements and upheavals in bituminous pavements: 
i) 
Inadequate compaction of the fill at locations behind bridge abatements, over utility 
cuts, etc. 
ii) 
Excessive moisture in sub-grade and permeable layer of sub-base and base caused 
by capillary action or poor drainage. 
iii) 
Inadequate pavement thickness.
7.4.6.4	 Severity 
Not Applicable 
7.4.6.5	 Treatment 
If settlements and upheavals indicate any inherent weakness in the fill, it may be necessary 
to excavate the defective fill and do the embankment afresh under properly controlled 
conditions. Material having good drainage qualities should be preferred. Under-drains may 
become necessary in locations where lack of drainage has been identified as the cause of 
failure. Where the cause of deformation is inadequate pavement thickness, then properly 
designed pavement shall be provided. 
7.5	
Disintegration 
There are some defects which, if not rectified immediately, result in the disintegration of the 
pavement into small and, loose fragments. Disintegration, if not arrested in the early stages, 
may necessitate complete reconstruction of the pavement. 
7.5.1	
Stripping
7.5.1.1	 Symptoms
This defect is characterized by the separation of bitumen film from the surfaces of the 
aggregate particles, due to the presence of moisture. This may lead to loss of bond between 
bitumen and aggregate and subsequently to loss of cohesion in mixture. A view of stripped 
aggregate surface is shown in Photo 7.5.1

Photo 7.5.1 Stripping of Bituminous Surface 
7.5.1.2	 Location: Stripping is either localized or extended to lane or the entire carriageway. 
7.5.1.3	 Causes 
Stripping may be caused by the following reasons: 
i)	
Use of hydrophilic aggregates. 
ii) 
Inadequate mix composition. 
iii) 
Continuous contact of water with the coated aggregate. 
iv)	
Initial over heating of the binder or the aggregate or both.
v)	
Presence of dust or moisture on aggregate surface when it comes in contact with the 
bitumen. 
vi) 
Occurrence of rain or dust storm immediately after construction 
vii)	
Higher concentration of salt in soil and rain water 
viii)	
Use of improper grade of bitumen 
ix) 
Ageing of the bitumen leading to the embrittlement of the binder film. 
7.5.1.4	 Severity
Not applicable
7.5.1.5	 Treatment 
In the case of surface dressing, hot coarse sand heated to at least 150°C and spread over 
the affected areas, may be used to replace the lost aggregates. After spreading, it should be 
rolled immediately so that it will be seated into the bitumen. If aggregates are only partially 
whipped off, a liquid seal may be the solution. In other cases, the existing bituminous mix 
should be removed and a fresh one laid. As a precautionary measure, a suitable anti stripping 
agent should be added to the bitumen, at the time of construction. Rejuvenating sealants, 
slurry seal or microsurfacing can be used to treat stripped surface.

7.5.2	
Ravelling 
7.5.2.1	 Symptoms
Ravelling is defined as progressive separation and dissociation of fine aggregate particles 
and binder from the bituminous surface. Normally, fine aggregates wear away first followed 
by coarse aggregates. The ravelling process generally starts from the surface downward 
or from the edge inward. Pavement surface lead to rough and jagged appearance after 
occurrence of ravelling. Ravelling differs from fretting that it involves plucking out of surface 
aggregate by traffic without loss of cohesion. 
7.5.2.2	 Location 
Ravelling may occur on any part of a lane or carriageway.
7.5.2.3	 Causes 
Ravelling is likely to occur on a surface due to one or more of the following reasons:
i) 
Inadequate bitumen content in a mix 
ii) 
Overheating of bitumen during mixing process 
iii)	
Inadequate compaction during construction
iv)	
Stripping of bitumen from aggregates due to water at interface
v) 
Construction during cold and wet weather 
vi)	
Use of inferior quality aggregates prone to fracture, crushing and opening of new faces
vii)	
Use of absorptive aggregates
viii) 
Excessive ageing of binder
ix) 
Lack of performance related contract specifications
x) 
Improper filler/bitumen ratio
xi) 
High intensity hydrostatic pressure due to combined effects of traffic and water
xii) 
Development of inclement weather (moisture, freezing) immediately after construction
xiii) 
Traffic stresses exceed breaking strength of mix
7.5.2.4	 Severity Level 
Ravelling may be classified into three severity levels, viz., low severity, medium severity and 
high severity (Photos 7.5.2.: a, b and c). Low severity is when some loss of fines is associated 
with initial stage of binder wearing out, medium is when loose particles exists with some loss 
having binder wearing out to a rough surface and high severity is when surface is too rough 
with loss of aggregates.

7.5.2.5	 Treatment 
The treatment of Ravellled surface shall depend upon severity of Ravelling.
a)	
Low severity ravelling: The low severity ravelling may be corrected by application 
of fog seal, sand seal, seal coat, slurry seal or microsurfacing
b)	
Medium severity ravelling: This may be corrected by application of seal coat, slurry 
seal or microsurfacing treatment in affected area
c)	
High severity ravelling: Depending upon the condition of ravelled surface and 
specification of existing surface, the high severity ravelling may be corrected by single 
or multiple applications of liquid seal coat, slurry seal, microsurfacing and surfacing 
of thin overlay of appropriate mix specification like mix seal surfacing or open graded 
premix carpet.
7.5.3	
Potholes 
7.5.3.1	 Symptoms
Potholes are bowl shaped cavities of varying sizes in a bituminous surface or extending into 
the binder/ base course, caused by localized disintegration of material.


IRC:82-2015
31
7.5.3.2	 Location 
Potholes may occur in any part of road surface. 
7.5.3.3	 Causes 
The most common cause of pothole formation is loss of adhesion in bituminous wearing coat 
due to the ingress of water into the pavement or due to higher voids in surface. The pavement 
gets softened as a result of loss of cohesion, and under the action of traffic. The formation of 
pothole is aggravated due to use of plastic filler in granular base. If not attended to in time and 
properly, aggregates in the surface get progressively loosened to result in a pothole. Lack of 
proper bond between the bituminous surfacing and the underlying water bound macadam 
base layer can also cause formation of potholes. Insufficient bitumen content in localized 
areas of the surfacing layer can also cause formation of potholes. A thin bituminous surface, 
which is unable to withstand the heavy traffic, can also cause formation of pot-holes, when 
associated with improper or inadequate camber. In dense-graded mixtures, pot-holes can be 
caused by too much fines or too few fines. 
7.5.3.4	 Severity 
Potholes may be classified as small, medium and large (Photos 7.5.3 : a, b and c). A small 
pothole is defined as 25 mm deep and 200 mm wide. The medium pothole is defined as 25 to 
50 mm deep and 500 mm wide. The large potholes are those greater than 50 mm deep and 
500 mm width. 
7.5.3.5	 Treatment 
The rectification consists of filling pot-holes with open graded or dense graded premix. 
Potholes can be repaired by various methods 
1. 
Mixes (cold mixed/hot mixed) for immediate use 
2. 
Storable cold mixes (cutback IRC:116/emulsion IRC:100) 
3. 
Readymade mixes 
4. 
Cold mixes by Patching machines 
7.5.4	
Edge -Breaking 
7.5.4.1	 Symptoms
A common defect in bituminous surface is edge breaking wherein the edge of the bituminous 
surface gets broken in an irregular way.  Photo 7.5.4 shows this type of defect. In case 
distress in not attended to in time, the surfacing may peel off in chunks at the edges.

32
Photo 7.5.4 Edge Break-up
7.5.4.2	 Location 
Distress is restricted to edges upto 30 cm from the edge. 
7.5.4.3	 Causes 
The following are the causes for edge breaking:
• 
Infiltration of water which make the foundation layers weak causing the pavement edges 
to break 
• 
Worn out shoulders resulting in insufficient side support to the pavement. 
• 
Inadequate strength at the edge of the pavement due to inadequate compaction. 
• 
Lower layer of pavement being wider than upper layers. 
• 
Too narrow width
7.5.4.4	 Severity
Not applicable
7.5.4.5	 Treatment 
The shoulder and the pavement materials in the affected area should be fully removed to 
a regular section with vertical sides. The pavement and the shoulders should be built up 
simultaneously with thorough compaction. A bituminous surface similar to that in the adjacent 
reach should be laid. The shoulder should have adequate slope to drain away to water. A slope 
one per cent steeper than the camber of the bituminous surface should be found generally 
necessary for earthen shoulders. In order to prevent the edges from getting broken again, 
the maintenance operations should include periodic inspection of the shoulder condition and 
replacement of worn out shoulder material with adequate compaction. In sandy areas where 
the soil is likely to be eroded by wind and rain, it may be advantageous to have brick paving 
at least for some width to protect the edges. Surface and subsurface drainage, wherever 
deficient, should be improved

SECTION 8
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
8.1	
 Introduction 
8.1.1	
Delays in maintenance increase the severity of distress in pavement leading to higher 
maintenance expenditure. Preventive maintenance is a planned maintenance activity, which 
decreases rate of surface deterioration and extend service life of bituminous pavement. It is 
a maintenance activity as a planned strategy of cost effective treatment of existing roads and 
its appurtenances that preserves the system, prevents future deterioration and improves the 
functional condition of the system without contribution to load carrying capacity of pavement. 
Such treatments are cost effective, if provided on a pavement in fair to good condition. The 
placement of right preventive maintenance treatment at the right time saves pavement from 
leading to poor condition (Tables 5.1 to 5.3), where rehabilitation and reconstruction would 
be inevitable.
8.2	
Selection of Preventive Maintenance Treatment 
8.2.1	
Preventive maintenance treatments shall be selected based upon the condition of 
existing pavement. The cracking, rutting, riding quality, climate and traffic are given due 
consideration in selection of preventive maintenance treatments. The concept of preventive 
maintenance stipulates that deterioration modes can be anticipated and at least partially 
mitigated before their occurrence. This provides following long term solutions:
	 Improved level of service resulting from improved pavement performance 
	  Delayed need for rehabilitation and reconstruction 
	 Life cycle cost saving 
8.2.2	
For preventive maintenance applications, the following guidelines must be 
considered:
 Existing distress to be treated 
	 Anticipated distress to be delayed or prevented
 Appropriate treatment for existing condition 
	 Timing of treatment for best results 
 Maximizing performance while minimizing cost 
8.2.3	
A thin overlay may not be considered as a preventive maintenance, when it is applied 
to a distressed pavement in poor condition. Slurry seal/microsurfacing may not be considered 
as preventive maintenance, when placed on an extensively cracked surface. A preventive 
maintenance strategy comprises following:

Figure 8.1 illustrate timing of preventive maintenance treatment, while selection of 
treatment depends upon type of distress, causes, severity, climate and traffic. Refer to Tables 
5.1 to 5.5 in Section 5 and conceptual illustration given in Figure 8.1, preventive maintenance 
shall be undertaken when drop in quality of pavement surface is less than 30% as quantified 
in Tables 5.1 to 5.3 by pavement condition rating criteria. Preventive maintenance treatments 
shall be effective before the pavement condition rating drops below 2. The type of treatment 
shall depend upon pavement condition rating as well as type and area of distress. The detailed 
warrants for choice of the treatment are given in Tables 8.1 to 8.7. 
8.2.5 
Suitable preventive maintenance treatment may be identified by following attributes:
	 Purpose of treatment 
	 Applicability
 
- Traffic 
	
- Environment

These treatments are 
intended primarily to prevent 
the intrusion of moisture 
through existing cracks. 
Crack sealing refers to 
a sealing operation that 
addresses “working” cracks, 
i.e., those that open and 
close with changes in 
temperature. It typically 
implies high quality materials 
and good preparation. Crack 
filling is for cracks that 
undergo little movement. 
Sealants used are typically 
elastomers modified 
bituminous materials that 
soften upon heating and 
harden upon cooling.

Edge-shoulder drop-off should be considered. Surface should be 
uniform to ensure uniform compaction.
Construction 
Considerations
Surface must be clean. A tack coat prior to overlay placement will help 
improve the bond to the existing surface. Thin HMA overlays dissipate 
heat rapidly and, therefore, depend upon minimum specified mix 
placement temperatures and timely compaction..

SECTION 9
PERIODIC RENEWALS
9.1	
Need and Importance of Periodic Renewals 
Periodic renewals consist of the provision of a surfacing layer at regular intervals of time or 
at a specified condition, so as to preserve the required serviceability level of the pavement 
surface and offset the wear and tear caused by traffic and weathering. Periodic renewals 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
42
represent the maintenance, which is needed to prevent deterioration of the pavement and to 
ensure that initial qualities are kept up for the future requirements of traffic during the design 
life of the pavement. Early detection and repair of noticeable distress/defects can prevent a 
major damage of the surface. 
9.2	
Planning and Programming of Renewals
The general practice in the country is to finalize renewal programme on an annual basis. The 
renewal programme for each section of a road should be decided well in advance. Once the 
programme is finalized, steps could be taken to secure the required allocations and start the 
preliminary field action such as mobilization of resources. While the nomenclature “Periodic 
Renewal” would imply the renewal treatment to be carried out at a fixed and pre decided 
frequency, it would neither be practicable nor desirable to follow implicitly of any specified 
frequency irrespective of the condition of the road surface proposed to be renewed. The most 
effective way to plan a renewal programme is to carry out periodic inspections of the road 
surface at suitable intervals in order to assess its condition and needs for providing renewal 
treatment. Visual inspection and actual measurements, if required (Appendix 1 and 2) of the 
roads as detailed in Section 5 should be carried out manually or through automated machine 
(Appendix 3). In addition, special inspections are also necessary before and after the rains so 
as to assess the need for pothole repair and patching and other remedial measures required 
to be carried out either in advance or together with the renewal treatment. 
9.3	
Identification of Stretches to be Renewed
The stretches of the road showing signs of distress such as hungry surface/hair-line cracking, 
Ravelling etc., should invariably be included in the renewal programme. This would ensure that 
the surface of the road and the pavement structure do not deteriorate further. The stretches 
of the road which would be due for periodic renewal on the basis of the pavement condition 
index and periodicity should be inspected closely and decision whether to include these in 
the renewal programme or to postpone the renewal for a specified period should be taken 
depending upon the condition of the road surface. In cases, the nature of distress/failure 
seen on the road is severe and of considerable extent and the causes are deep-seated; 
and where it is considered that the pavement cannot be improved with renewal treatment, 
detailed investigations shall be carried out and special measures shall be taken for correcting 
the same. 
9.4	
Types of Renewal Treatments 
The types of bituminous surfaces those can be adopted are surface dressing (one or two 
coats), thin premix carpet, mixed seal, stone matrix asphalt ,hot/cold mix semi- dense and 
dense bituminous concrete. Microsurfacing in one layer or two layers can also be used for 
renewals. These surface have different life spans depending upon traffic and environmental 
conditions. 



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
43
The specifications adopted for the renewal layer on a particular road would depend upon 
the type of the original surface and its condition at the time of renewal. Following standards/
specifications may be referred for periodic renewals 
i) 
IRC:14 ‘Recommended Practice for Open Graded Premix Carpet’
ii) 
IRC:110 ‘Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Design and Construction 
of Surface Dressing’
iii) 
IRC:111 ‘Specifications for Dense Graded Bituminous Mixes’
iv) 
IRC:SP:78 ‘Specifications for Mix Seal Surfacing (MSS), Close Graded Premix 
Surfacings (CGPS)’
v) 
IRC:SP:79 ‘Tentative Specifications for Stone Matrix Asphalt’
vi) 
IRC:SP: 81 ‘Tentative Specifications for Slurry Seal and Microsurfacing’
vii) 
IRC:107 ‘Specifications for Bitumen Mastic Wearing Courses’
The specification and the thickness of the renewal course should be such that, as far as 
possible, the road surface is restored close to its original condition. For example, renewal 
over an original hot mix bituminous concrete surface would have to be bituminous concrete. 
9.5	
Periodicity of Renewal 
Based on the experience and condition indices given in Tables 5.1 to 5.5, broad guidelines 
for the type of renewals are given in Table 9.1. This may be utilized as a guide for working out 
annual renewal programme on different sections of roads.

*	 When the condition of road is rated as 1, it is recommended that a detailed investigation is carried 
out to assess the strengthening requirement, if any. In case, the pavement is found to be structurally 
adequate, then the periodic renewal will suffice.
**	 Wherever feasible, recycling of wearing course may be preferred
The priority of renewal treatment may be decided based on rating assigned as explained in 
section 5.1, earlier. If there are 10 roads (say), with ratings from 1.4 to 1.8, the roads may be

arranged based on the ascending order of condition rating and the periodic renewal shall be 
prioritised in the same order subject to budgetary allocations.
9.6	
Rectification of Profile at the Time of Renewal 
The camber and super elevation provided initially on a road tend to get flattened out due to 
traffic. Before the renewal of surface is done, the cross profile should be corrected by means 
of a suitable profile correction course/leveling course, which may be compatible with existing 
surface specification. 
SECTION 10
MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR RECTIFICATION OF  
DISTRESS ON BITUMINOUS SURFACE 
10.1	
General 
The Section 7 has dealt with the identification of the distress, measurement of distressed area, 
types of defects and their causes, and the maintenance measures to be taken up in each 
case. This Section describes various materials required for maintenance methods, which 
are applicable to “Routine, Preventive and Periodic Maintenance”. Routine maintenance is 
covered in Section 7. Preventive type of maintenance activities are covered in Section 8. 
Maintenance operations of periodic nature are described in Section 9.  Repair materials and 
methods discussed in this Section fall under three categories: 
i)	
Rejuvenation 
ii)	
Seal and
iii)	
Patching
Rejuvenation of oxidized and hungry bituminous surface can be done by application of liquid 
bituminous materials. The seal coat is a thin application of bitumen, which shall be covered 
with fine aggregate/ sand. Seal coat may be premixed material or a spray application. Patching 
is an application of premixed bituminous mixture. Patching is done to fill pot-holes, correct 
shallow depressions, rutting and correct edge irregularities. 
10.2	
Bituminous Materials
10.2.1	 Paving Bitumen
Paving Bitumen conforming to IS: 73:2012 is recommended for road maintenance works, 
unless otherwise specified. Paving bitumen is classified into four grades based on viscosity, 
viz., VG-10, VG-20, VG-30 and VG-40. 



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
45
10.2.2	 Cut-back Bitumen
Cut-back bitumen of different grades are required for cold weather construction as well 
as maintenance under all-weather conditions. Medium curing cut-back bitumen MC-800 
conforming to IS: 217 is recommended for preparation of storable bituminous pothole/
patching mix. 
10.2.3	 Bitumen Emulsion
Bitumen emulsion is a two-phase system consisting of bitumen, water and one or more 
additives to assist in formation and stabilization and to modify the properties of the emulsion. 
The bitumen is dispersed throughout the water phase in the form of discrete globules, typically 
1.0 to 25 µm in diameter, which are held in suspension by electrostatic charges stabilized 
by an emulsifier. Bitumen emulsions conforming to IS: 8887 are recommended for various 
maintenance applications including preparation of cold mixes and patching mixes.
10.2.4	 Foam Bitumen
Foaming of bitumen is a means of reducing the binder viscosity and increasing the binder 
volume. Foam bitumen is produced in an expansion chamber in which cold water, between 
1 and 5% by weight of bitumen, is injected under pressure into hot bitumen to produce foam. 
Expansion ratio and half life are two important properties of foam bitumen. The expansion 
ratio is defined as the ratio of the volume of foam produced to the volume of liquid bitumen 
injected. The life time of foam is expressed as the ‘half-life, defined as the time after which 
the maximum volume of foam is reduced by a factor of two. It is measured in seconds. The 
foam bitumen is used for stabilization of recycled asphalt pavement. 
10.2.5	 Modified Bitumen
Modified bitumen is the binder whose properties have been modified by the use of polymers 
and rubbers. IRC : SP 53 and IS: 15462 specify different grades of modified bitumen for 
construction and maintenance of bituminous roads. 
10.2.6	 Modified Emulsions
Modified emulsions are defined as bitumen emulsions whose aqueous phase is generally 
modified by latex of the rubber. Sometimes, bitumen is also modified before emulsification. 
These emulsions are used for microsurfacing applications. The specification of modified 
emulsion for microsurfacing is given in IRC: SP: 81. 
10.2.7	 Rejuvenating Agents/Sealants 
Rejuvenating agents are used for restoration of physico - chemical properties of oxidized 
bitumen of dry and hungry surface or oxidized bitumen in recycled asphalt pavement. 
Sometimes, these rejuvenating agents are used as sealants. The viscosity value of these 
rejuvenating agents lies between 100-300 seconds at 60 °C by Say bolt fural viscometer. 



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 81
======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
46
10.2.8	 Anti-Stripping Agents
Anti-stripping agents are organic surf act ants which are used to prevent stripping of bitumen 
from aggregate and to improve adhesion between wet aggregate and bitumen. Specifications 
of anti-stripping agent are given in IS: 14982. 
10.2.9	 Warm Mix Additives
A warm mix asphalt technology utilizes chemical additives that have little effect on theological 
properties of the binder. These additives reduce mixing, laying and compaction temperature 
of bituminous mixes. The guidelines for warm mix asphalt are given in IRC:SP:101. 
10.3	
Maintenance Techniques 
10.3.3	 Rejuvenating Seal
Rejuvenating seals are applications of thin layer of liquid bituminous material such as low 
viscosity grade bitumen like VG-10, cut-back bitumen, bitumen emulsion or bituminous 
sealants (Rejuvenating Agents). A number of proprietary rejuvenating agents are also 
available. This process comprises application of a liquid bituminous material with or without 
cover aggregate of fine grading. The application of cover aggregate may be required or may 
not be required. 
Rejuvenator shall be used as a maintenance measure under the following conditions; 
	 The area to be treated needs to be in fair to good condition and not approaching the end 
of its life. 
 When the road surface is in a condition which does not show significant cracking, ravelling 
or rutting.
	 Where the road is structurally adequate i.e. major patching or reconstruction is not 
required. 
Rejuvenation functions by introducing an extremely resilient membrane on the top layer of 
surface course. Such membranes are impervious to water and the chemicals used for de-icing 
and as such it prevents their ingress which would normally cause further deterioration of the 
binder. It also halts the loss caused through oxidization of maltenes present in the bitumen, 
which are necessary for flexibility of bituminous layer. The viscosity of such binders shall 
be in the range of 100-300 seconds at 50°C when measured by Say bolt Furol viscometer. 
Bitumen to be used for such treatment shall be of VG-10 grade confirming to IS :73. Cut-back 
bitumen may also be suitable. If emulsion is to be used, it should be of the Rapid Setting 
type (RS-I) or Slow Setting (SS-2) grade. The quantity of binder for such treatment shall be 
as follows:

* Either of the three, as required
The cover aggregates, if needed, shall be of a nominal size of 6.3 mm, viz. passing through 
9.5 mm IS Sieve and retained on 2.36 mm IS sieve. The quantity of cover aggregates shall 
be 0.09 m3 per 10 sq. m. area. The area to be treated shall be thoroughly cleaned. If viscosity 
grade or cut-back bitumen is to be used, the wet surface should be allowed to dry. However, 
if cationic bitumen emulsion is to be used, the surface may or may not be required to be wet 
or dry depending upon quality of emulsion. Some tailor-made emulsions may not require 
damping of surface. The binder shall be applied either by a spray nozzle or a pressure 
distributor. Cover aggregates are then spread at the specified rate and rolled in position with 
suitable steel wheel roller. When viscosity grade bitumen is used, the road can be opened 
to traffic on the following day. However,  if the road is required to be opened immediately, a 
speed restriction of 10 km/h shall be enforced till the following day. When cut-back bitumen 
is used, the finished surface shall be closed to traffic until it has sufficiently cured to hold the 
cover aggregate in position. If emulsion is used, the road can be opened to traffic after 2-3 
hours. 
10.3.4	 Fog Seal 
Fog seal is defined as “a light application of dilute (SS-2 or tailor made) bitumen emulsion 
which is used primarily to seal an existing bitumen surface to reduce ravelling and enrich 
dry and weathered surfaces. Fog seal is a method of incorporation of bituminous binder to 
an existing pavement to improve its waterproofing characteristics, prevent further stone loss 
by holding aggregate in place, rejuvenating surface and improving the surface appearance. 
However, its inappropriate use can result in a slick pavement. During application, bitumen 
emulsion wets the surface of the aggregate. Cationic emulsion can displace water from the 
surface of aggregate and existing binder film. The rate of breaking emulsion is dependent on 
several factors including weather conditions (e. g. wind, rain, temperature, etc.). Rejuvenating 
emulsion has oils which help in softening of the oxidized binder in existing surface, thus 
reducing its viscosity. This also improves the flexibility of the binder, which reduces the 
possibility of cohesive failure. This may be beneficial in situations where the surface has 
an open texture and the existing binder has become hard and brittle due to aging. As with 
conventional emulsions, if these do not penetrate the surface, they may create a surface 
prone to skidding after they break. 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:82-2015
48
Properly calibrated truck mounted distributors shall be used to apply the emulsion. Spray 
nozzles with 4 to 5 mm openings are recommended. The emulsion may be heated to maximum 
50°C, although, the emulsion is generally sprayed at ambient temperature. The emulsion is 
sprayed at a rate that is dependent on the surface conditions. A test section representative of 
the entire surface should be chosen to decide application rate. The total quantity of emulsion 
in fog seal is normally from 0.5-1.0 l/m2 of diluted SS emulsion (1:1 dilution). The surface 
condition or texture, dryness and degree of cracking of the pavement determine the quantity 
required. Excessive application of the fog seal must be avoided as this will result in pickup 
of bitumen by vehicles leading to a slippery surface. When excess emulsion is applied, a 
light application of fine sand on the affected area may be applied to prevent formation of 
sliding surface. The detail of fog seal applications, its benefits and limitation are given in 
IRC:SP: 100
10.3.5	 Slurry Seal
Slurry seal is a mixture of dense graded mineral aggregate, emulsified bitumen, filler, additive 
and water. The mixture is applied as surface treatment on the existing surface. Slurry seal 
can be used for both preventive and corrective maintenance needs. This treatment does 
not increase the structural strength of a pavement. A pavement which is structurally weak, 
should be repaired first before applying slurry seal. Ruts, humps, distressed pavement 
edges, crown deficiencies, or other surface irregularities that affect riding quality should be 
corrected before placing slurry seal, which is considered to be a very effective maintenance 
technique for the surfaces of older pavements. It will fill the surface cracks, stop ravelling and 
loss of matrix, improve skid resistance, generally protect the pavement, reduce water and 
oxidative deterioration, and finally extend the overall pavement service life. Slurry seal has 
the following major advantages:
• Rapid application and early open to traffic 
• Excellent surface texture and friction resistance
• Ability to correct minor surface irregularities
• Minimum loss of kerb height
• No need for manhole and other structure adjustments
• Excellent low cost treatment for urban streets
Slurry seal is applied in a very thin layer of 3 to 6 mm. The grade of emulsion to be used 
is SS-2. The machine used for mixing and application is a self-contained, continuous-flow 
mixing unit which accurately delivers to the mixing chamber the pre-determined amount of 
aggregate, mineral filler, additive, water, and bitumen emulsion. Specifications for slurry seal 
are given in Table 10.1. The details of this treatment are given in IRC:SP:100.

10.3.4	 Microsurfacing
Microsurfacing shall consist of mixture of modified (Polymer or Rubber Latex) bitumen 
emulsion, well graded mineral aggregate, water, filler and additive (if needed) proportioned, 
mixed and uniformly spread over a properly prepared surface. The finally laid microsurfacing 
shall have a homogeneous mat, adhere firmly to the prepared surface and provide friction 
resistant surface texture throughout its service life. The mix is to be a quick setting system 
i.e. it should be able to receive traffic after 1-2 hours depending upon weather conditions. 
This may be used for a variety of purposes such as surface sealing treatment to improve skid 
resistance, and longevity/ of surfacing, durability and to seal fine and medium cracks. It is 
applied on an existing pavement surface which is structurally adequate but is showing signs 
of distress such as premature aging, aggregate loss, cracking, high degree of polishing etc. 
Generally, microsurfacing is laid in single layer, but when the existing surface is highly polished 
and/ or cracked, it is advisable to apply it in two or more layers. As a surface treatment, 
micro-surfacing imparts protection to the underlying pavement and provides renewed surface 
friction values. Special emulsifiers in micro-surfacing emulsions contribute to the quick 
setting characteristics. Minor re-profiling can be achieved with multiple applications. Special 
equipment permits the filling of wheel ruts up to 40 mm deep in one pass. 
The major benefits of microsurfacing are given as under: 
 
Quick application (One lane- km in 35 minutes)
 
Minimum traffic hold up (Work is done in lane wise manner) Quick opening to traffic 
 
Life span exceeds the life span of ordinary Bituminous Concrete

heavy traffic. It can be used for pavements in urban and rural areas, primary and inter-state 
routes, residential streets, highways, and toll roads. It can also be used on the top of single 
coat surface dressing (Cape Seal), on open graded premix carpet without seal coat and also 
on Dense Bituminous Macadam/Bituminous Macadam. Various types of microsurfacing that 
can be used for different applications; quantity of microsurfacing mix and the residual binder

fill the voids between the chips. Cape seals provide highly durable surface treatment. The 
slurry or microsurfacing bonds the chips to prevent loss of the chips due to traffic abrasion. 
For a successful cape seal, it is important to have single coat surface treatment with lower 
residual bitumen content than a traditional chip seal. The most critical element to avoid in a 
cape seal is an excess of slurry that eliminates the desired knobby surface texture. Curing 
time of four to ten days should be allowed between placement of the broomed surface after 
surface dressing and before application of slurry seal or microsurfacing to remove loose cover 
material or other foreign material that would prevent adherence. Table 10.3 gives quantities 
of bitumen emulsion and aggregates required to execute a cape seal. For surface dressing, 
RS-2 emulsion shall be used. For slurry seal, SS-2 grade emulsion shall be used. Polymer 
modified emulsion shall be used if microsurfacing is used as top layer.

10.3.6	 Sand Bituminous Premix Patching
Sand bitumen premix patching consists of laying a mixture of fine aggregate and bituminous 
binder to rectify cracks, slippage, corrugations, shoving, shallow depressions and ravelling. 
The fine aggregate shall be a medium coarse sand (fineness modulus of more than 2.5) or 
fine grit passing 1.70 mm IS Sieve and retained on 180-micron IS Sieve. The binder can 
be paving viscosity based bitumen or rapid curing cut – back such as RC-3, or a medium 
curing cut-back such as MC-3. The area is thoroughly cleaned and a tack coat with bitumen 
emulsion or VG-10 bitumen or cutback (RC-3 or MC-3) is applied at the rate of 2.5 kg per 
10.sq m The mix is prepared in suitable mechanical or hand-operated mixers by mixing binder 
and sand. The quantity of sand and binder shall be 0.06 cu m and 6.8 kg (quantity of binder 
in terms of penetration grade bitumen) per 10 sq m area respectively. The mix is spread and 
laid wherever required. When smoothening a corrugated surface ,it may be expedient to use 
a drag spreader with its blade adjusted to clear the high spots. The mixture is then rolled 
thoroughly till it is compacted. 
10.3.7	 Open – Graded Premix Patching
Open – graded premix patching consists of making up the area to be patched by a premix 
open – graded material consisting of a binder and aggregates, compacting and finishing with 
a seal coat. This repair method is applicable for fatty surfaces, slippage, rutting, shoving, 
shallow depressions and pot holes. The binder can be bitumen of suitable viscosity grade,

Such emulsion-aggregate mixes can be mixed in a pug mill or in a concrete mixer and 
transported to the site where these are to be used. The heating of the aggregate is normally 
not necessary. In cold weather conditions, warm aggregates and emulsions heated upto 750C 
to 850C can be used for better workability.  Procedure for preparation of mix for immediate 
use and storable mixes is given in IRC: SP: 100. The bitumen emulsion recommended for 
patching mixes are MS, SS-2 grades or tailor-made. The recommended aggregate gradation 
is given in Table 10.4. Bitumen emulsion containing slightly higher amounts of solvents 
generally produces the acceptable patching mixes for immediate use.

The quantity of emulsion shall be 7 to 8 % (4.5 to 5.5 % residual bitumen) by weight of 
aggregate. 
b)	
Storable Maintenance Mixes
During the cold weather and rainy months, most of the maintenance mixes used are those 
which may be stored / stockpiled, which can be produced in late summer or early months of 
winter, transported and stored in remote locations for later use. Such mixes are usable for 
periods up to six months and are workable without the use of heat. These must be covered by 
polythene or tarpoline. The production of stockpile maintenance mix is simple and includes 
a pug mill type mixer. Slow setting (SS-2) grade or tailor made emulsion is to be used for

this purpose. The aggregate gradation for stockpile mixes is same as given in Table 10.4. 
The duly mixed material shall be stored in a clean, covered area to prevent contamination 
and not stored in a low area or depression where water could get into the mix. For prolonged 
stockpiling and to be usable at lower temperatures, a high float medium setting emulsion 
is recommended. These mixes may contain residual bitumen in the range of 4.5 to 5.5% 
depending on gradation and surface characteristics of aggregates. 
c)	
Maintenance Mixes using RAP (MMRAP)
Many bituminous pavement overlay projects include cold milling of bituminous surface and 
produce large quantities of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). There are a number of uses 
for RAP in pavements application, and an increasing one is to use it as maintenance mix. It is 
recommended that, when possible, cold milling be used which produces RAP material in small 
pieces so that it would not require further crushing. Bitumen emulsion or foamed bitumen is 
usually incorporated to the RAP by plant mixing. Special emulsion formulations have been 
developed for preparing RAP containing maintenance mixes, since softening of the aged 
RAP asphalt binder is desired. Emulsion contents or foamed bitumen in the range of 1.5 to 
2.5 percent by dry weight of RAP are typical for these mixes. RAP maintenance mixes are 
stored in stockpiles and their handling is similar to traditional emulsion maintenance mixes. 
Normally SS-2 emulsion with more solvent is useful. These mixes may be used successfully 
for both thin and deep patching, the latter including potholes repair. In areas where coarse, 
crushed aggregates are not available, the use of RAP usually results in superior maintenance 
mixes to those produced from local aggregates.  
d)	
Readymade Mixes
Ready to use cold mix patching materials are also effective for instant repair of potholes 
on roads under inclement weather and operating conditions. These mixes are expected to 
contain 4.5 to 5.5% of residual bitumen and continuously graded aggregates. Such mixes can 
be stored upto six months from date of manufacture. More details are given in “Specification 
for Readymade Bituminous Pothole Patching Mix Using Cutback Bitumen (IRC: 116) and 
IRC:SP:100.

Pothole shall be cleaned of loose material and dust with a stiff wire brush. Pothole need not 
be dry. However, excess water, if any in the pothole, shall be removed from the pothole. A 
prime coat shall be applied to WMM/granular surface before placing the mix to ensure good 
bond at the bottom. The mix is intended for filling potholes up to 75 mm deep. For deeper 
potholes (more than 75 mm), patching mix shall be placed and compacted in two or more 
layers of 25 to 75 mm. Initially the pothole may be filled using Crusher Run Macadam (CRM). 
First, the outside edge or periphery of the patch shall be compacted with a hand rammer and 
then compaction shall proceed inwards. To prevent initial pick up of the loose mix by the hand 
rammer, either continue to wet the hand rammer with water or place empty plastic lined bags 
on the loose mix. For deep potholes, place the patching mix and compact in 75 mm thick 
layers. After compaction, the compacted patch shall be about 10 mm higher than the existing 
road surface to allow for further compaction by traffic. If there are numerous closely spaced 
patches, it is preferable to use a small roller rather than a hand rammer. If a roller is used, the 
compacted patch shall be about 3 mm higher than the existing road surface. Before opening 
the compacted patch to traffic, sufficient amount of clean sand shall be sprinkled on the patch 
to prevent pick up by traffic. 
10.3.9	 Stress Absorbing Membrane for Crack Sealing
This method deals with sealing of the cracks using a Stress Absorbing Membrane (SAM), 
which is an elastomeric bitumen rubber membrane, which is laid over a cracked bituminous 
surface, together with a covering of aggregate chips, in order to extend the life of the pavement 
before major treatment is carried out. SAM can be laid as a single coat or a double coat 
depending upon severity of cracking. The quantities of materials required for SAM are given 
in Table 10.5.

The base on which the SAM is to be laid shall be well prepared. The surface shall be thoroughly 
cleaned either by using a mechanical brush or any other suitable equipment preferably a 
jet of air. The equipment and general procedures shall be in accordance with Manual for 
Construction and Supervision of Bituminous Works. The application temperature for modified 
binder shall be 160-180 °C. Immediately after application of the modified binder, clean, dry 
aggregate shall be spread uniformly on the surface using a mechanical grit spreader. Small 
areas may be treated with manual spreading. Where a two coat SAM is required the 2nd 
coat shall be applied within 90 days of first coat and a gap of 15 days between two coats is 
necessary. Traffic may be permitted over a SAM, 3 hours after rolling, but the speed shall be 
limited to 20 km/hr, until the following day. Speed control measures are to be approved by 
the Engineer, prior to laying.

TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT
11.1	
General
 Use of mechanized methods and techniques for carrying out various maintenance activities 
are recommended for achieving efficiency and quality in maintenance operations. Suitable 
tools, plants and equipment of appropriate capacity need to be deployed keeping in view the 
type and magnitude of the work and desired output. Proper maintenance and upkeep of all 
maintenance tools, plants and equipment is very important to ensure quality work. It is always 
advisable to follow equipment maintenance instructions and schedule as per manufacturer’s 
specifications. Some of the tools and equipment especially tend to develop inaccuracies 
and defects with usage and hence, their regular monitoring/checking and rectification is 
essential.
Crack filling, pothole filling and patching works form the major part of the bituminous surface 
maintenance. While the crack sealing is generally carried out by manual methods, pothole 
filling and patching can be efficiently carried out by mechanized methods.

11.2	
Pothole Filling/Patching
There are two main elements of durable pothole filling/patching; the material and the 
repairs process. For every combination of these two factors, the cost effectiveness of the 
overall pothole filling/patching work will depend on material, labour and equipment costs 
and the quantity of the work. The most economical  combination of materials and process 
to the extent possible should be adopted to produce long lasting and cost effective patch 
repairs.
11.3	
Tools and Equipment for Pothole/Patch Repairs
For carrying out durable, long lasting and cost effective repairs of potholes and patches, the 
following tools and equipment are generally required:
i) 
Material truck (with hand tools)
ii) 
Equipment truck
iii)	
Mechanical tool/equipment for pavement cutting and dressing 
iv) 
Compaction device (vibratory walk behind roller or plate compactor)
v)	
Air compressor with pavement cutter
vi) 
Spot mix (preparing hot/cold asphalt mix in situ)
vii) 
Asphalt mix carrying and laying equipment 
viii) 
Traffic control devices and equipment
ix) 
Mechanical brooms for highways and urban roads
11.4	
Modern Mobile Mechanised Pothole Filling/Road Patching Technologies
For durable and cost effective pothole filling/road patching, innovative indigenous and 
imported mechanized road patching technologies are available.  Most machines and 
techniques incorporate use of cold mixes, while some use infrared radiation technique for 
heating the road surface for use as patching material. The following are some of the widely 
used technologies for the purpose:
• Machine Mixed Spot Cold Mix and Patching Equipment
• Mobile Mechanized Maintenance Units
• Jet patching Velocity Spray Injection Technology 
The deteriorated portion of the existing pavement adjoining the pothole should be cut and 
loose particles removed before patching of pothole.

SECTION 12
ARRANGEMENTS FOR TRAFFIC AND SAFETY MEASURES DURING 
ROAD MAINTENANCE
12.1  Safety during Maintenance Work in Progress
12.1.1 The road construction and maintenance activities are an integral part of road network 
development and its preservation. Maintenance of roads is a normal recurring and periodic 
activity. During execution of maintenance activities, proper arrangements for safe operation 
and movement of normal traffic, maintenance workers and equipment in the work zones are 
most important. The road work zones are areas of conflict between normal operating traffic, 
workers, maintenance equipment and machines and work zone traffic. Care has to be taken 
to avoid/ remove conflicts between workers, maintenance equipment and traffic. As a good 
practice, it should be essential to prepare a Work Zone Traffic Management Plan (WTMP) 
to provide for reasonably safe and efficient movement of road users through or around the 
work zones, while reasonably protecting the workers and equipment. WTMP should provide 
for continuity of the movement for motorised vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic, transit 
operations, and access to properties and utilities. 
It is equally important to ensure the safety of workers in Work Zones. Work zones present 
constantly changing conditions that are not expected by the road users, which create an 
even higher degree of vulnerability for the workers present near the roadway. A concurrent 
objective of the WTMP is the efficient construction and maintenance of the highway, as well 
as efficient resolution of traffic incidents, if any, likely to occur in the work zone. The WTMP, 
therefore, should facilitate the smooth and efficient flow of traffic as well as safe working 
environment.
12.1.2	 Since maintenance operations involve considerable hardship, inconvenience and 
hazard to traffic and also hazard to maintenance workers, all possible precautions should 
be taken to make safe arrangements for traffic. These include erection of barriers, signs, red 
flags and lights. In order to promote road safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly 



======================================================================


IRC:82-2015
59
movement of traffic on all roads during maintenance phases, road signs and other traffic 
management tools help in regulations of traffic and provide warning and guidance needed for 
safe, uniform and efficient operation.
12.1.3 A road sign should meet the following five basic requirements for their 
effectiveness:
a)	
Meet the requirement;
b) 
Command attention;
c) 
Convey a clear and simple meaning;
d) 
Command respect from road users; and
e)	
Give adequate time for response.
Design, placement, operation, maintenance, and uniformity are aspects that should be 
carefully considered in order to maximize the ability of a road sign to meet these basic 
requirements.
12.1.4 The maintenance related activities shall confine to half of the pavement width at a 
time leaving the other half for use by the traffic, to the extent possible. Otherwise, diversion 
roads may have to be constructed or the traffic diverted to some other alternative route with 
a proper information arrangement about the alternative. The maintenance operation itself 
can be conveniently confined to a small length at a time. The appropriate warning sign to be 
used such as “Men at Work” sign during working, or the “Narrow Road Ahead” sign if half 
of the road width is available for traffic, should also be displayed. During night, there should 
be adequate lighting with red reflectors/flashers/blinkers. All signs shall be in accordance 
with IRC 67 ‘Code of Practice for Road Signs.’ For further guidance and details on safety 
measures and traffic management during maintenance, IRC:SP 55 “Guidelines on Traffic 
Management in Work Zones” may be referred to.
12.2	
Road Signs, Pavement Markings and other Traffic Control Devices
12.2.1 After completion of the maintenance work, the existing road markings, road signs 
etc. shall be restored to ensure safe and smooth movement of traffic. The maintenance staff 
shall keep the road authority informed of deficiencies, if any, observed in road signages, 
markings and other traffic control devices. Safety measures for necessary action to remove 
the deficiencies, is warranted  to be identified for implementation therefore, as per relevant 
IRC Standards and Codes of practice.

SECTION 13
ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
13.1	
Maintenance of a road requires proper planning, programming and adequate tools, 
equipment, machinery and skilled workers/operators to carry out the required maintenance 
activities. There should be well equipped dedicated maintenance units or divisions within the 
organization in order to achieve the intended purpose in an effective and efficient manner. 
For primary roads, the nodal agency to identify the priorities and initiate action related to 
maintenance implementation is either MORTH or NHAI. In case of secondary and tertiary 
roads, the maintenance is the responsibility of the State governments whereas urban roads 
are looked after by the local bodies. The traditional method of maintenance of roads by 
departmental work force or road gangs is being phased out and the road authorities are 
exploring alternative methods of implementing maintenance. Maintenance by contract 
is perceived as an efficient method. While it has been in practice since long and used 
successfully for implementing renewal programmes, the experience of road agencies with 
contracting out of routine maintenance has not been so successful and most road agencies 
have not yet switched over to routine maintenance contracts. This may be due to lack of 
standardization of contract forms and non-availability of maintenance contractors. Considering 
the size of the country’s road network and road hierarchy, several forms and methods of 
implementing routine maintenance may be required to choose the one most suited to a road 
agency. Efforts are underway in this direction to standardize various types of maintenance 
contracts. In addition to this, availability and development of maintenance contractors 
requires to be addressed in a big way. In the transition period, the road agencies have to 
modernize the existing system to bring in efficiency, productivity and improved performance 
by introducing mechanization, mobile maintenance units, new and energy saving materials 
and institutionalizing dedicated maintenance set up. The effort should continue be to move 
towards contracting out of maintenance by proper packaging the scope of the maintenance 
contracts to improve their viability, and also to test alternative forms of contracts to develop 
a proper maintenance contract framework specific to the requirements of a road agency. 
Contracting out maintenance requires assured funding and effective supervision. Some model 
bidding documents for road maintenance have been developed for use of road agencies 
and these documents incorporate provisions for performance security, maintenance 
standards, performance criteria, simplified payment procedure, damages for non- 
performance, etc so as to ensure that  the contractor is held accountable for the performance 
of maintenance.
13.2 
 Performance Based Maintenance Contracting (PBMC) is widely used for maintenance 
of roads.  The contract specifies objective performance standards which define the road 



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
61
condition to which the roads are to be maintained and not allowed to fall below the specified 
level any time over the maintenance contract period. Monthly lump sum payments are made 
for maintenance on the basis of the accepted contract price. Monthly lump sum payments are 
subject to deductions if the required performance standard is not achieved. The deductions 
are effected as specified in the contract. Effective supervision is required to ensure that there 
is no deficiency in the performance of maintenance and condition of the roads and road 
assets included in the contract is maintained to the specified level. 
13.3 
For routine maintenance of low volume  roads like village roads and ODRs, use of 
labor based and semi- mechanized methods are generally preferred. As the traffic increases, 
the level of mechanization should also increase for carrying out maintenance efficiently. 
For maintenance of roads carrying high volumes of traffic, machine  based methods and 
technologies capable of carrying out maintenance with speed and safety and causing 
minimum interruptions in movement of traffic are recommended. 
13.4	
Planning and scheduling of the maintenance operations should be given due 
importance. The annual renewal programme should be drawn up well in advance keeping in 
view the condition of the surface and any improvement work carried out recently or scheduled 
to be taken up in the near future. In case sufficient funds are not available for renewal works, 
the priority may be decided following the suggested criteria given in Section 9.5. This would 
enable the field engineer to plan and implement maintenance programmes in a rational 
manner and according to available budget.

PAVEMENT CONDITION ASSESSMENT/VISUAL SURFACE CONDITION 
ASSESSMENT
Surface distress is a measure or indicator of the structural and resulting functional state of 
a pavement structure and is generally given the prime importance by concerned agencies. 
Physical distress is identified and a quantitative visual assessment of distress is made by a 
well experienced/trained team of 3-4 persons while moving in a vehicle at a speed of 8-10 
km/hr.
While recording the distresses, the details for the following are visually noted and recorded 
in individual percentage for each km length in Proforma 1.

APPENDIX-3
 METHODOLOGY FOR PAVEMENT CONDITION SURVEY
The surface condition of the pavement is assessed mainly in terms of roughness, pavement 
surface distress in the form of cracking, ravelling, potholes, edge break, patch work, rutting, 
skid resistance and texture depth.
A.	
Pavement Surface Roughness Measurements
The roughness of existing pavement is assessed in terms of Roughness Index in mm/km as 
per the procedure given in IRC:SP:16 using Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator/Automatic Road 
Unevenness Recorder and Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator. Also, as per the international 
practice, the Roughness in terms of International Roughness Index (IRI) is measured using 
various state-of art equipments such as Dipstick, Walking Profiler and Laser Profilometer. 
1.	
Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator/Automatic Road Unevenness Recorder
Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator (FWBI) is attached to the vehicle (Photo 1) and runs at a specified 
speed of 32±1 km per hour. Depending upon the undulations on road surface, the fifth wheel 
makes vertical movements relative to the road surface. To record the vertical movements of 
fifth wheel, integrating unit is connected to the axle of fifth wheel with the help of a cord which 
is firmly fixed onto the frame. The tension in the cord is mounted by a spring inside the drum. 
The cable is wound around the pulley for about 2½ turns after initial tensioning. The vertical 
movements of wheel are recorded in an electromagnetic counter which is connected through 
a circuit, with power supply provided from the jeep battery. 
Photo 1 Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator
With the recording of roughness, the distance travelled is recorded so that the roughness can 
be expressed in terms of specified length of road section, say per km. Usually, the unevenness 



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 81
======================================================================

IRC:82-2015
67
is expressed in mm/km. In order to facilitate recording of distance travelled, an arrangement 
for measurement of wheel revolutions is provided on the axle of fifth wheel itself.
2.	
Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator
Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator consists of an integrating unit, which is mounted on the 
rear axle of a car/jeep (Photo 2). There are two sets of counters, one each for the bump and 
distance measurements together with a switch, located on the panel board. Any one set of 
counters can be used at a time by the recorder. The advantage of having two counters is that 
while one is in use, the other will display the data for the previous run. Apart from this, the 
switching of counters with the help of toggle switch provided in the panel board gives km wise 
data exactly. The power source is car battery itself. 
Photo 2 Schematic of Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator
A cable is taken from a fixed point on the rear axle of vehicle and is wound around a pulley 
forming part of the integrating unit. The integrating unit is located in the floor of vehicle’s 
dicky. The cable is wound around the pulley for about 2½ turns after initial tensioning. The 
working of integrating unit and the recording process are same, as in the case of FWBI.
Some of the commonly used system, which are now finding applications in India too, for 
measurement of Pavement Surface Roughness in terms of International Roughness Index 
in m/km are described below:

Laser Profilometer
Laser based road profiling is a high speed road roughness measuring system. The Laser 
Profilometer beam is installed in front of the survey vehicle. The field measurements using 
Laser Profilometers can be done at speeds ranging from 30 to 100 kmph. This system is based 
on the measurement of vertical displacements using Laser Rays. Laser Profilometer Bar, as 
shown in Photo 3, comprises of two Laser sensors used for measurement of longitudinal 
profile of the pavement surface. These sensors are placed along the wheel path of survey

vehicle. The system directly gives International Roughness Index(IRI) for both wheel paths 
of survey vehicle viz. Left IRI and Right IRI in terms of m/km.

Merlin
MERLIN (Machine for Evaluating Roughness using Low-cost Instrumentation) can be used 
either for direct measurement or for calibrating response-type instruments such as the 
vehicle-mounted bump integrator. It consists of a metal frame 1.8 m long with a wheel at the 
front, a foot at the rear, and a probe midway between them that rests on the road surface. 
The probe is attached to a moving arm at the other end of which is a pointer that moves over 
a chart. The machine is placed at successive locations along the road and the positions of 
the pointer are recorded on the chart to build up a histogram. The width of this histogram can 
be used to give a good estimate of roughness in terms of the International Roughness Index. 
A typical view of the equipment is shown in photo 4.

Dipstick-Auto Read Road Profiler
It is a precise electronic digital level and profiler. It stands on two support legs. Just by a 
simple twist of the wrist, it can take readings along a survey line. It measures, displays and 
records the elevation difference between front and the rear leg. The readings that are taken 
are accurate upto 100th decimal place. It directly gives International Roughness Index in m/
km. A typical view of the equipment is shown in photo 5.

Walking Profiler 
Walking Profiler is a precision instrument designed to collect surface profile data. These 
data can be used to accurately assess the characteristics and quality of any continuous 
paved surface. Typically, the surface profile is used to generate a number of internationally 
recognized roughness index, ride quality and pavement maintenance indices etc.
It is a precision surveying tool which is designed to operate at a moderate and steady walking 
pace in a straight line. The equipment has an integral Control Unit which provides all the 
functions of instrument calibration, survey setup and operator feedback. Like Dipstick, it also 
directly gives International Roughness Index in m/km. A typical view of the equipment is 
shown in photo 6.

Measurement of Pavement Surface Distress
Distress is developed in the pavement surface in the form of cracking, ravelling,  potholes, 
edge break, rut depth, patch work, texture etc. with passage of time due to a variety of 
influencing factors such as traffic volume and loads and climatic conditions etc. 
1.	
Manual Method:
The measurements of pavement surface distress on flexible pavements are measured 
manually in terms of area in square meter, meter as given in Appendix-2
2.	
Pavement Surface Imaging Technique:
Image Processing Techniques are being used for quantification of pavement surface distress. 
These techniques involve the use of pavement cameras for pavement surface imaging. 
These pavement cameras, as shown in photo 7, generate the calibrated images (with known 
length and width) of the pavement surface. The measurement of various surface defects viz. 
cracking, ravelling, patching and pot holes is done by using the Image Processing software.

	 Stopping distance based techniques for initial assessment of surface friction of pavements. 
 The Portable Skid Resistance Tester can be conveniently used for measuring skid 
resistance of pavements. For obtaining reliable results with this method, tests should be 
carried out at carefully selected representative locations. 
 Side Force Coefficient or cornering friction on paved surfaces using Mu-Meter, a high 
speed device for measuring skid resistance. 
 Skid Trailor used for measuring braking force coefficient of friction. This is also a high 
speed device for measuring skid resistance.
1. Portable Skid Resistance Tester (British Pendulum Tester): This is a dynamic pendulum 
impact type tester used to measure the energy loss when a rubber slider edge is propelled 
over a test surface. The tester is suited for laboratory as well as field tests on flat surfaces 
and for polish value measurements on curved laboratory specimens from the accelerated 
wheel tests. (ASTM – E 303 – 1978). A typical view of the equipment is shown in photo 8

2. Mu-Meter: Mu-Meter is a continuous friction measuring equipment comprising of a light 
weight trailor unit (254 kg) capable of being towed by a standard vehicle. The trailor unit 
comprises a triangular frame on which two friction measuring wheels are mounted. The rear 
wheel which drives the recorder also measures the distance. The Mu-Meter measures the 
sideway coefficient of friction generated between the test surface and the smooth tread tyres 
operating at 7½ degree angle to the direction of travel under wet condition. The speed of 
measurements is 40 mph (64 kmph).
The tyre pressure of the measuring wheel is 0.70 kg/sqcm and for the rear wheel is 2.10 kg/
sqcm. The unit is provided with an Average Friction Automatic Printout Unit (APO) carried 
in the cab of the vehicle and is operated electrically by a 12v battery. (ASTM E – 670 -79).A 
typical view of the equipment is shown in photo 9.

Measurement of Texture Depth
The macro texture depth is determined by sand patch method as per clause 602.12 of 
“Specifications for Road and Bridge Works” of the MORTH (Fifth Revision)
The macro texture in terms of Mean Profile Depth in mm can also be collected automatically 
using modern laser based systems usually installed in Automated Road Survey Systems.

APPENDIX 4
UTILITY FOR RATING OF PAVEMENT BASED ON  
QUANTITY OF DISTRESS:
A simple application in Ms-excel has been prepared for calculating the overall/final rating of 
the road based on the quantity (%) of various distresses as per the ranges described in Table 
5.1 to 5.3 in Section 5, for different categories of roads. The application developed for all 
categories of roads, is available to the users in the CD enclosed with this document. 
This utility assigns the rating value to each individual parameter from 1, 1.1 to 2.0 and 2.1 
to 3.0 which corresponds to Poor, Fair and Good condition of the road respectively. After 
assigning the rating number to each parameter, an appropriate weightage (fixed) is given 
(multiplier) to the rating value of each individual parameter, for calculation of the Weighted 
Rating Value of each individual parameter. 
For the calculation of the Weighted Rating Value of each individual parameter, the following 
fixed weightages have been assigned. 
S.No.
Parameter
Weightage (Fixed) (Multiplier Factor)
1
Cracking
1.00
2
Ravelling
0.75
3
Potholes
0.50
4
Shoving
1.00
5
Patching
0.75
6
Settlement
0.75
7
Rut Depth
1.00
The Final Rating Value is calculated by taking the average of the Weighted Rating Values 
of all parameters viz. cracking, ravelling, potholes, shoving, patching, settlement and rut 
depth. For demonstration of the calculations, one typical example for highways (as per 
Table 5.1) is given below. Similarly, final rating for other category of roads may also be worked 
out, using the same approach.
