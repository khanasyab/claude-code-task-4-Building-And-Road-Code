ROAD TRANSPORT AND ENERGY
1. INTRODUCTION
l.I. The publication on Road Transport and Energy, was first printed
in 1984. As the data included therein had become outdated, the Transport
Planning Comniittee of Indian Roads Congress had taken up the revision of
tliis publication. Tlie draft of revised Manual was considered by the Transport
Planning Committee (personnel given below)
in
its meeting held
at Patna
on 28th November,
1992 and approved
subject
to
certain
modifications
suggested by members.

1.2. The
document was
thereafter
considered
by
the
Highways
Specifications & Standards Committee in its meeting held on 08.11.93 and
approved subject to further modifications, if any, to be made by a subcommittee
consisting
of
S/Shri M.K.
Bhalla &
A. P.
Bahadur.
Tlie
approval
from
Executive Committee was obtained through circulation. The document was
subsequently considered by the Council in
its meeting held on 20.11.93 at
Bangalore, wherein Convenor & Member-Secretary
of Highways Specifi-
cations & Standards Committee were authorised
to carry out editing and
minor modifications,
if
required, on the basis of comments of members
before getting
tlie same printed. The edited document was finally received
from Convenor, Highways Specifications & Standards Committee on 8th
March, 1995 for printing.
2. ENERGY SCENE
The energy transition from the traditional sources
to die modern has
taken place over the period of Industrial Revolution and the period following
it. In the first phase, coal replaced wood as the dominant source of energy.
In the second phase of transition, coal began to be replaced by oil, natural
gas and electricity. At present, 45 per cent of the total energy consumed in
tlie world is from liquid fuels, 32 per cent from solid fuels, 20 per cent from
gas and the balance 3 per cent from electricity. Oil is thus the predominant
source of energy in the world.
Tlie share of these four principal forms of energy
in some selected
countries make interesting reading. Fig.
1.
In India, the major share (65 per
cent) is for solid fuels because of the dependence of coal and firewood. Next
in importance conies liquid fuels, which account for nearly 29 per cent. The
shares of gas and electricity are 5 and
1 per cent respectively. As a contrast,
the U.S.A., one of the most industralised nations, obtains the bulk (42 per
cent) of its energy requirements through liquid fuels. Solids account for only
23 per cent, whereas gas accounts for 31 per cent and electricity accounts
for 3 per cent. As nations have marched ahead in industrial activity, they
have switched on progressively to liquid fuels and gas.
Fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) are not inexhaustible. Tlie proven original

billion tonnes
Tliese are being consumed
at a very fast rate. Nearly 30 per cent of
the conventional oil, 14 per cent of gas and 11 per cent of heavy oils have
already been consumed. Everyday 53 million barrels of oil are produced and
consumed.
^Flius
at the current level of consumption, liquid fuels may not
last for more than 3 or 4 decades.
It may be mentioned that the
first 200
billion barrels of world oil were produced in 109 years from 1859 to 1968.
Tlie second 200 billion barrels were produced in just 10 years from 1968
to 1978. Tlie third 200 billion barrels would have been consumed in the period
1978 to 1988.
llie world production rates seem to have stabilised at around
20 billion barrels a year, thanks
to energy conservation measures.
Coal deposits can, however,
last for a much longer time. At present
only about 2.5 per cent of the reserves has been exploited. Tlufs world coal
deposits can
last to more than 3,000 years.
Tlie price of oil is very sensitive to political developments. Tlie energy
shocks of 1974 and 1979-80 have been accompanied by steep increase in
the price. The recent Gulf war saw the price of a barrel to touch $42. Fig.
2 shows the trend in OPEC
oil prices.
The developing countries, many of which are non-oil-producing, are
bound to be hit very adversely by the growing price of oil. Already ihe per
capita consumption of energy is very low in these countries, and they have
a long march ahead to catch up (Fig.
3). Whereas the growth rate of energy
consumption in the developed economies during 1980-89 was in the range
of 1-2 per cent per annum, in the developing countries
it was in the range
of 3-6 per cent. In India's case,
it was 6.1 per cent, llie GNP grew at around
5 per cent during this period. Tlius, the growth rate of energy consumption

is slightly more than dial of GNP. Tliis trend is likely to continue. India and
other developing
countries
will have
to
investigate ways and means of
conserving energy.
Tlie coal reserves in India are estimated to be 83,000 million tonnes.
The present rate of consumption
is 200 million tonnes. At
tliis
rate,
the
reserves can
last for another three
to four centuries. Out of an estimated
hydro-electric potential of 396 TWH
(Trillion Watt-Hour),
the
electricity
generated
is around 50 TWH. Tlius there
is a good scope for development
of hydro-electric reserves in India. India's published and proved oil reserves
are 4.3 billion barrels (roughly 300 million tonnes).
It may take just 17 years
to exhaust these. India has some gas reserves, which are now being tapped.
vSince oil reserves in India are fast depleting, the long-term strategy for
energy should be to tap its hydro-electric potential, build nuclear power plants
and tap renewable energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal, wave, biomass
etc.)
India
has
had
a
remarkable
success
story
in
oil
exploration
and
production.
Beginning
with
a
meagre
0.2
million
tonne
is
1950,
the
production
rate now
is
30
million
tonnes
(1991-92).
In
view
of
the
cjicouraging
results
of recent exploration
activities,
it
is
likely
that
the
programme of oil exploration and development
will be accelerated
in the
coming years.
Tlie production and consumption of crude
oil
in the
last decade are
indicated
in
Figs. 4 and
5
respectively.
Tlie consumption
of petroleum
products
is
indicated
in
Fig.
6.
Tlie
average
amiual
rate
of growth
of
consumption of petroleum products during the period 1974 to 1991 has been
5.6 per cent.
Tlie excess of consumption over indigenous production has
resulted in inevitable
oil imports.
Fig.
7. The mounting
fuel import hill
is
depicted in Fig.
8. ^Hie .deficit in oil, which was nearly 60 per cent in 1980-
81
, was around 30 per cent in 1989-90.
In 1980-^X), the oil imports consumed
nearly 22 per cent of the export earnings. 'Hiese statistics demonstrate
that
India
is under severe economic pressure on account of the mountino
oi]
consumption.
The
consumption
of
oil
products
in
the
country
has grown

compound rate of 5.6 per cent per annum in llie period 1974-90. During ihe
Sixth Plan the growth rate was 5.5 per cent. In the vSeventh Plan, the growth
rate was 6.8 per cent.
Fig. 9 gives
the per capita consumption of petrol
in some selected
countries. Tlie highest
is in USA with 1,438 kg.
In India,
it
is a low
3 kg.
Fig. 10 gives the per capita consumption of diesel
in some selected
countries. Australia leads with 431
kg. India's consumption
is
18 kg.
Both in terms of production and consumption of energy, India is at tail
end. Inspite of this unhappy situation about 24 per cent of energy in India
is
lost before
its final end use.
3. TRANSPORT AND ENERGY
Transport is an important sector which consumes energy. 'Hie percentage
share of the transport sector in total commercial energy consumption in some
selected countries is shown in Fig.
1 1. In some countries, the share is as high
as 56 per cent, whereas in some others
it
is as low as
1 1 per cent. In India
is around 24 per cent.
Die Railways use coal, oil and electricity for traction. I'he percentage
share of oil has gone up progressively
in the past years with a downward
shift
in
the
use of coal. The
increasing
stress on
railway
electrification
currently being pursued will result in less dependence on oil and should be
welcomed.
Road
transport
is
totally dependent on
oil
for
propulsion. Though
alternative fuels are being investigated, in the immediate future petroleum
products
alone
will
be
the
propulsion
fuel.
The
alternate
fuels
being
considered are methanol, compressed natural gas, hydrogen and electricity
(through batteries). But
it will lake many years of research
to accomplish
success in their common use in road vehicles. The other modes of transport,
viz, air transport and ships, also use oil exclusively. F?g.
12 gives the model
distribution of the commercial energy
in India
in the transport sector.
It
is
seen that oil forms 84 per cent of the energy consumption
in the transport
sector. Oil for road transport alone accounts for 65 per cent of the total energy

consumed in the transport sector and 77 per cent of the total oil consumed
in the U^ansport sector. Thus, oil for road transport represents nearly 16 per
cent of the
total energy consumed in
all sectors in the country.
The population of registered motor vehicles in India is given in Table
1. The major products used in road U:anspdrt are peU-ol and diesel oil. PeU-ol
was the first fuel to be introduced when the internal combustion engine made
its entry. Cars and two-wheelers
still use peu-ol. With the sudden spurt in
the production of two and three wheeler vehicles in the recent past, their
fuel consumption accounts
to about 60 per cent of petrol consumed by
vehicles
in the country.
Diesel was introduced much
later following
the
development of an efficient fuel injection system. Since then it has become
very popular for trucks and buses.

common for personal movement, the share of petrol
is high. In U.S.A., for
example the share is 89 per cent. The position in developing countries is just
ihe
reverse,
with
a
high
percentage
of
diescl
consumption
and
a
low
percentage of petrol consumption. In India, for example, the diesel share
is
87 per cent and the petrol share is
1 3 per cent, lliis is because of the emphasis
on public transport
in buses and the low car-ownership.
Fig. 14 gives
tlie percentage of diesel consumed in road transport in
some selected countries. In India, 63 per cent of the
total diesel consumed
is
in the road transport sector. Considerable diesel
is used
in India
in the
agricultural sector, particularly for irrigation by means of diesel pump sets.
In view of growing
oil-shortages,
it would be prudent
to encourage
the
gradual replacement of such pump-sets by electrical pump-sets, lliis would
make
diesel
available
to
the
road
transport
sector,
which
has
no
such
alternative.
Tlie high
share of
diesel
(and kerosene
for domestic cooking
and
lighting) in India places heavy dependence on middle distillates. Since the
quantity of middle
distillates
is
fixed
per barrel
of
oil
refined,
the high
consumption of diesel
will be bound
to create
difficulties
in
the refining
process. Ultimately, the country may have to swap some of the products or
import some.
There
is some increase
in
the commercial
intensity of the transport
sector since the early
197()s.
It
is attributed generally due to larger share of
traffic handled by the road sector especially by trucks hauling goods to longer
distances.
Tlie second
contributing
factor
is
the
rapid growth of energy
intensive modes like taxis/cars/lwo and three wheelers vis-a-vis public modes
like buses/coaches/mini-buses.
Tlie passenger mode energy
intensities are given
in
Fig.
15 and the
freight mode energy intensities are given in Fig.
16. Hie comparison brings
out glaringly that steam locomotives are extremely inefficient and should be
phased out. The personalised modes (cars and scooters) consume excess fuel
per passenger-Km to buses. Diesel and electric rail propulsion is many times
more energy efficient than diesel
trucks. Barges and pipe-lines hold much
promise for future development.

Liquid fuel as discussed above,
is not going
to last for more than
3
to 4 decades from now onwards and
therefore
the bitumen which
is
a
byproduct of oil shale deposit is going to be in acute shortage and eventually
may not be even available for the purpose of repairs of asphalt pavements.
As a strategy there should be an emphasis on the construction of roads using
indigenous material.
It is appropriate to make a mention that constructions
using cement provides a promising alternative.
4. ENERGY CONSERVATION IN ROAD TRANSPORT
4.1. Since road transport uses bulk of the liquid fuels of which India
is
in short supply, conservation of energy in
this sector must be accorded
very high priority. Various measures are possible, many of them simple and
easy to implement. Already many countries have adopted some of them and
stabilised the fuel consumption almost
at a constant level inspite of steady
growth
in road transport
activities.
4.2. Road Surface Type and
Its Effect on Fuel Consumption
Road vehicles have to overcome the friction at the tyre-road interface
when moving. The smoother the surface, the less
is the energy needed
to
overcome friction.
It can be seen from Table 2 that more than 50 per cent
of road length is unsurfaced contributing to loss of energy. Tlie riding quality
of a surface
is measured by various methods. Tlie one adopted in India
is
by means
of
tlie Towed
Fifth Wheel Bump
Integrator. The
roughness
recorded by this instrument
is in terms of upward movement caused when
it is towed at a constant speed of 32 km/lir. It is measured in mm/km. Different
surfaces have different values of roughness, and different levels of maintenance
give different values of roughness for the same type of surface. Table 3 gives
the common values.
The effect of roughness on
fuel consumption of vehicles has been
studied
in India through controlled experiments.
Figs.
17 and
18 give the
results for a car and a 10 T two-axled truck when driving
at an optimum
speed of around 40 km/lir.
The results show
that
:
(i)
a very poorly maintained asphaltic concrete .surface or preniix carpet
re.sults in
excess
fuel consumption of 2-4 per cent.

(ii)
providing an
asphallic concrete
surface
in place of premix carpet or surface
dressing
results
in
a
fuel economy of about
1-4 per cent.
(iii)
providing a bituminous surfacing of premix carpet or surface dressing over a
WBM road can achieve
fuel saving of 6-8 per cent.
4.3. Effect of Overloading of Trucks
The load carried by a truck inlluences fuel consumplion significantly.
Fig. 19 shows the effect on three truck types moving on an asphaltic concrete
surface level road
at 40 km/lir.
Each
size
of
a
truck
is
efficient
for
a
particular pay
load.
The
productivity of a truck in terms of Tonne-km per litre increases as the truck
size increases. This effect is shown in Figs. 20 & 21. Tlius, for carrying large
loads, multi-axled trucks and truck-trailer combinations are
ideal. Besides
achieving fuel economy, such trucks cause less damage to road pavements.
4.4. Effect of Speed
When vehicles travel at low speed, using the first or second gears, fuel
consumplion
is high. As speeds increase, and higher gears are used, the fuel
consumplion comes down. There
is a speed,
in the range of 30-50 km/lir,
when the fuel consumplion
is a minimum.
It again increases as speeds rise
thereafter. The fuel consumplion curve
is tJius typically U-shaped. Figs. 22,
23, 24 and 25 give the trends for various vehicles.
It
is seen
that driving
vehicles
in
a range of speed of 30-50 km/lir results
in the minimum fuel
consumplion.
Good
driving
habit
should
recognise
this
pnenomenon.
Overspeeding must be discouraged.
It
is for this reason that soon after the
energy crisis in 1973, many countries imposed a speed limit. Given in Table
4
are
ihe optimum speeds and
the
related
fuel consumption
for various
vehicles.
4.5. Effect of Pavement Width
When the pavement widih is inadequate for accommodating the traffic,
congestion occurs, forcing the vehicles to move at low speeds and frequenily
accelerating and decelerating. This
results
in excess consumplion of fuel,
lliis
is a serious waste and can be prevented by timely widening of road

4.6. Effect of Grade
Vehicles negotiating upward grades have
to overcome
the forces of
gravity, causing extra energy consumpiioiL On the other hand, when vehicles
travel downgrade, fuel
is saved. ll\e pattern of excess fuel consumption on
upward gradients is shown in Fig. 27 for a typical car and a truck. This factor
should be borne in mind when designing the vertical profile of new roads.
4.7. Fuel Wastages due to Idling
When vehicles are forced to stop and engines are idling, fuel
is burnt
without any productive eflort. Forced stops are found at traffic junctions and
check barriers. Delays at junctions can be minimised by optimum design of
signal settings and coordinated signals. Check barriers should be avoided or
their number reduced. Octroi posts are a source of considerable wastage of
fuels. Fducaling
the drivers
to shut off the emzine can save
luel.

4.8. Effect of Congestion on Fuel Consumption
As the traffic on a road increases, the vehicles experience congestion.
Whereas they are able
to follow steady
state speed conditions under low
volumes, they have to perform frequent changes of speeds under congested
conditons. Under extremely congested situations, stop and go motions take
place. Consequently,
loss of fuel
takes place
as shown
in
Fig. 28. Recent

research carried out in India have quantified the excess fuel consumed under
congested conditions. The excess
is in the range of 40-70 per cent. Tliis
is
a serious loss and can be prevented by timely augmentation of road capacity.
4.9. Energy Saving on Account of Cement Concrete Roads
Lately the cost comparisons of flexible and concrete roads are being
done in terms of whole-life-cycle cost where both
initial construction cost
is clubbed with maintenance cost to get a realistic comparison. Tlie studies
have proved that generally concrete roads are cheaper. A study in USA has
shown that there can be fuel saving to the extent of 20 per cent in the case
of heavy vehicles using properly designed cement concrete roads. Tlie reason
attributed
to
this
saving
is
that
the heavy
trucks
cause
relatively more
deflection on flexible pavements
tlian on rigid pavements and part of the
energy
is expended in deflecting the pavement which otherwise would be
available for propelling the vehicle and partly more energy would be lost
in surmounting constantly tJie ridges of deflection basin by the moving wheel.
However, their claim of 20 per cent saving in fuel is applicable only to heavy
vehicles plying in tlie UvSA and the type of rigid pavement constructed there.
A study done on a
1.6 km cement concrete pavement in North India
has shown that about 5 per cent
- 9 per cent fuel saving
is possible
in the
case of heavy
vehicles
if flexible pavements
are replaced with concrete
pavements. Fig. 29 depicts
is a typical curve showing the relation between
Fuel Consumption (cc/km) vs speed (km/lir) for a truck with a pay load of
15 tomies. Tlie percentage of National Highway in the country is in the order
of a mere 2 per cent of the total road network and if tliey are converted to
cement concrete roads, the saving
is of the order of Rs 560 crores of fuel
per year. There are also savings
in other vehicles operating costs
that can
be brought about (tyre wear, maintenance and repair cost, depreciation, etc.).
All these savings amount to nearly Rs 13,000 crores over a period of 12 years.
4.10. Better Vehicle Technology
Tlie technology of vehicle fleet in India
is a
little outmoded. A
lot of
changes have taken place in the countries abroad, resulting in fuel savings.
ITiis is brought about by belter engine design, use of aerodynamic shape of
bodies, use of light weight materials
like plastics, flbre-reinforced-plastics
and ceramics, thinner sections and smaller size of vehicles. A typical example

is
tlie Maruti Car. This
is shown in Fig.
30. At optimum speeds,
the fuel
consumption of an Ambassador Car
is nearly 70 per cent higher than of a
Maruti Car.
Trucks can be made lighter by replacing wooden bodies by
steel or
aluminium. Buses can be made lighter by having aluminium bodies instead
of steel.
4.11. Management and Planning Methods for Conserving Energy
Tliere being a limitation in the identification and production of more
energy sources, the energy policy of the Government needs to be given more
attention to demand management in the form of more scrutiny and emphasis
on
its efficient use. In
lliis direction even energy audits and standardisation
of various equipments and machineries being used should be taken up in
energy conservation programmes.

There are many energy saving measures in the road sector which can
be adopted to save substantial amount of fuel. This calls for a great deal of
management and planning skill to harness benefits by planners, builders and
users of the road. Tlie important measures recommended for adoption under
various heads are
:
A. Improvement of Road Infrastructure
1.
Widening of roads
to avoid congestion of roads.
2.
All earthen roads should be paved with WBM and then bituminous
surfacing and all WBM roads should be provided with thin bituminous
surfacing.
3.
Four laning of all segments of arterial routes viz. National Highways,
carrying heavy
traffic volumes.
4.
Construction of Expressways along selected routes.
5.
Construction of by passes, and ring roads around towns.
6.
Synchronised signalling of adjoining intersections should be adopted
in cities to achieve optimal use of road network to quickly dispose off
tJie
U-affic.
7.
Road encroachers and hawkers should be cleared so as to remove side
friction
to
traffic flow.
8.
Removal of irritants like octroi posts and rail road crossings where fuel
is wasted by waiting vehicles.
9.
Concrete roads are now proved to be fuel efficient with
5 per cent
-
9 per cent saving in the case of heavy vehic'es. Heavily trafficked roads
should
be
slowly
converted
to
concrete
roads
which
are
almost
maintenance free.
10.
Recycling of old bituminous mixes from failed pavements is a practical
step in conserving energy.
Tliis should be seriously taken up.
11.
Mechanised production of asphalt mixes and paving results in durable
and long lasting roads and hence should be adopted in a bigway. At
the same time emphasis should be given
to produce durable asphalt
mixes. Qu^hty assurance system should be introduced in the projects.

Bituminous emulsions can be used in cold condition in road mixes thus
saving energy required for healing aggregates and bitumen in Hot Mix
Plants.
