GUIDELINES FOR PLANNING  
AND DESIGN OF ROUNDABOUTS
The IRC:65 “Recommended Practice for Traffic Rotaries” was first published by Indian Roads 
Congress in 1976. For the last three decades, India is witnessing massive road development 
program to improve the mobility and connectivity. New vehicle models have been entered 
into road system and vulnerable road users are exposed to high speed traffic movement. 
All these result in road crashes and it is reported that more than 50% of road accidents are 
junction related accidents. Therefore, a need was felt to revise the IRC:65 for rotary which is 
a safer junction control where two road of comparable traffic volume is intersecting as well as 
junction having considerable right turning traffic. Accordingly, the work of revision of IRC:65 
was taken up by the Road Safety and Design Committee (H-7) during the tenure 2015-
2017 under the Convenorship of Shri Nirmaljit Singh. A subgroup comprising Dr. Sewa Ram 
(Subgroup Chairman), Dr. Geetam Tiwari, Dr. Manoranjan Parida, Shri Jacob George, Dr. 
P K Agarwal have developed the draft. The draft prepared by the subgroup was discussed 
in various meeting of H-7 committee and the document was subsequently approved by H-7 
Committee in its meeting held on 18.03.2017 for placing before the HSS Committee.

1 General
A roundabout is a specialized form of at-grade intersection where vehicles from the converging 
arms are forced to move round a central island in one direction in orderly and regimented 
manner and move/weave out of the roundabout into their desired direction. In conventional 
roundabout, traffic at entry seek suitable gap in the circulating stream to negotiate the 
central island. Instead of entering traffic seeking suitable gap with circulating stream, rotary 
intersection of larger central islands permits weaving maneuvering. The self-regulating form 
of roundabout is safe because of reduced crossing conflict points and aesthetically pleasing 
in appearance. When a cross road is converted into a roundabout, the number of conflicts can 
be reduced from 32 to 8 as illustrated in Fig. 1.1, wherein potential right-angle collision will be 
converted into angular-collision. For these reasons, roundabouts are more safe compared to 
uncontrolled cross road junction.

2 Definitions and Terminologies
The basic definitions and terminologies associated with the roundabouts/rotary and 
determination of its capacity and level of service are discussed in this section. 
2.1	
Geometric Parameters
The geometric elements of a typical roundabout/rotary are given in Fig. 2.1.
	
•	
Central Island: It is the raised portions around which the vehicles maneuver 
to negotiate towards their respective destination. The basic function of the 
central island is to convert the direct conflict points into angular conflict 
points and reduce severity of conflict points. It is also meant for providing 
appropriate turning radius to the vehicle.
	
•	
Circulatory Carriageway: The clockwise curved path followed by vehicles 
to move around the central island. 
	
•	
Circulatory Carriageway Width: The width between the outer edge of the 
kerb face of inscribed diameter and the central island kerb face.
	
•	
Circulating Path Radius: The minimum radius on the fastest through path 
around the central island.
Fig. 2.1 Geometric Elements of Roundabout
	
•	
Entry Radius: It is radius of curvature provided to entry arm so that vehicle 
entering from approach road decelerates and enters the roundabout at 
designated speed. 
	
•	
Entry Width: It is the width of the carriageway at the entry of the roundabout.
	
•	
Exit Angle: It is the angle by which traffic is deflected from the weaving 
section towards exit of the roundabout.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
4
	
•	
Exit Radius: It is the radius of curvature provided to exit side of the roundabout 
so that vehicle from roundabout is accelerated to leave the roundabout. 
	
•	
Exit Width: It is the width of the carriageway at the exit of the roundabout.
	
•	
Inscribed Circle Diameter: The inscribed circle diameter is the basic 
parameter used to define the size of a roundabout. It is measured between 
the outer edges of the circulatory path.
	
•	
Non-Weaving Width : It is the width of the carriageway used by the circulating 
traffic. It can also be defined as the width of the road from the edge of the 
central island to the deflecting island as shown in Fig. 2.1.
	
•	
Splitter or Deflecting Island: It is kerbed island and associated road 
markings on the carriageway, located between an entry and exit on the 
same roundabout arm. It is shaped so as to deviate and separate opposing 
vehicles onto and from the circulatory carriageway of roundabout.
	
•	
Weaving Length: It is the length of the weaving section in rotary.
	
•	
Weaving Section: It is the road section used by the traffic wherein either 
the merging or diverging of traffic takes place within the rotary. It can also 
be defined as the section where the traffic from both the approach arm and 
non-weaving enters.
	
•	
Weaving Width: It is the width of the carriageway of the weaving section in 
rotary.
	
•	
Giveway Line: A line of demarcation separating the traffic approaching the 
roundabout from the traffic in the circulatory carrigeway. The Giveway line 
is usually defined by dotted edge line pavement marking. Entering vehicles 
must give way to circulating traffic.
2.2	
Flow Parameters
	
•	
Circulating Stream: The two circulating stream in the roundabout are defined 
as the near and far major streams, with respect to the entering vehicles or 
the give way line. For the case of two entry lanes, the inner and outer minor 
lane are so defined that the outer lane is the one closest to the kerb face. 
	
•	
Entry Flow: The traffic inflow from an entry to a roundabout.
	
•	
Non-Motorized Traffic (NMT) Crossing: The dedicated roadway section 
across the vehicular motion for pedestrian and bicycle (preferably separately) 
near the splitter island. 
2.3	
Driver Behavior Parameters
	
•	
Classification of Gap Acceptance: Gap acceptance parameters are 
affected by geometry of the entry. These parameters are function of the 
circulating flow and measured in seconds. 
	
•	
Critical Gap: Critical gap is defined as the minimum headway in the circulating 
flow while an entering vehicle can safely enter a roundabout, assuming all 
entering drivers are consistent and homogeneous (refer Fig. 2.2).

Fig. 2.2 Entry & Circulating Headway and Gap
	
•	
Floating Entrance: If the driver finds a gap and does not have to stop at 
the entry arm, the vehicle is defined as floating vehicle. It is the first vehicle 
entering a gap while the succeeding vehicles are known as follow-ups 
vehicle.
	
•	
Follow-up Time: Follow-up time is the time span between two queued 
vehicles entering the circulating stream in the same gap. If more than one 
vehicle from minor stream uses a gap then the succeeding vehicles are 
referred to as follow-ups. It can only be measured when there is a queue 
situation.
	
•	
Gap Acceptance: All gaps greater than or equal to the critical gap would be 
accepted.
	
•	
Gap Rejection: All gaps less than the critical gap would be rejected.
	
•	
Gap: A gap is the time span between two consecutive circulating vehicles 
that create conflict with an entering vehicle. The described time span is 
measured only when the entering driver is at the give way line when the gap 
begins. (Fig. 2.2)
	
•	
Headway: It is the time between two following vehicles and is measured 
from the first vehicle’s front bumper to the following vehicle’s front bumper.
	
•	
Lag: A lag is the time between the arrival of entering vehicle at roundabout 
entry and the arrival of successive conflicting vehicle in the circulating flow.
	
•	
Static Entrance: If a vehicle has to stop at the give way line and wait for 
a sufficient gap before entering the roundabout, it is referred to as static 
entrance.

2.4	
Performance Parameters
	
•	
Delay: Delay is a parameter used to measure the performance of a 
roundabout. There are two types of the delays experienced at roundabouts, 
namely queuing and geometric delay. 
	
•	
Entry Capacity: Entry Capacity at roundabouts is the maximum traffic inflow 
from an entry to a roundabout when the traffic flow at that entry is sufficient 
to cause queuing in its approach road. 
	
•	
Geometric Delay: Geometric delay is the delay caused by slowing down 
the vehicles to stop at the end of queue (if any) after accepting the gap to 
negotiate, proceeding through the roundabout and then accelerating back to 
normal operating speed. It excludes the time to wait for an acceptable gap.
	
•	
Level of Service (LoS): Level of service offers the qualitative traffic flow 
condition at roundabout, i.e. free flow, stable flow, unstable flow or force 
flow. At roundabouts, level of service (LOS) is expressed in terms of average 
delay per vehicle. 
	
•	
Queuing Delay: Queuing delay is the delay caused due to waiting of vehicles 
to accept a gap in the circulating path.
3 Roundabouts
Roundabout may be described as an enlarged junction, where all entering vehicles shall 
give way and find suitable gaps to move around an island in one direction before they move 
out of the traffic flow into their respective directions radiating from the island. Contrary to the 
functioning of roundabout, the rotary type of intersection works upon the weaving behavior of 
entry and circulating traffic. The Inscribed Circle shall be large enough to ensure the weaving 
in rotary. Based on diameter of Inscribed Circle Diameter (ICD) roundabouts are further 
categorized to single lane and double lane roundabouts.
3.1	
Single Lane Roundabouts
This type of roundabout is characterized as having a single-lane entry at all legs and one 
circulatory lane. Fig. 3.1 shows the features of a typical single lane roundabout having 
a diameter ranging from 28 m to 40 m. The geometric design typically includes raised 
splitter islands, a non-mountable central-island and pedestrian crossing. The size of the 
roundabout is largely influenced by the choice of a design vehicle and available Right 
of Way (RoW). In order to increase the circulating radius of smaller vehicles, a slightly 
raised circular concrete paved path along the circumference of the central island called 
Truck Apron can be provided, if required, which would help long vehicles to mount upon 
them to turn safely.

3.2	
Multilane Roundabouts
Multilane roundabouts are with two or more entry lanes. In some cases, the roundabout 
may have different number of lanes on one or more approaches (e.g., two lane entry on 
the major approach and one lane entry on the minor road). They also include roundabouts 
with entries on one or more approaches that flare from one to two or more lanes. These 
require wider circulatory roadways to accommodate more than one vehicle travelling side 
by side. Fig. 3.2 shows the features of a typical multi-lane roundabout having a diameter 
ranging from 40 m to 70 m. The speeds at the entry on the circulatory roadway and at the 
exit are similar or may be slightly higher than those for the single lane roundabouts. The 
geometric design will include raised splitter islands, a non-traversable central-island, and 
appropriate entry path deflection.

4 Rotary Intersection 
Roundabout and rotary are two different types of road intersections. Roundabout primarily 
functions based upon give way behavior by entering traffic giving priority to circulating 
traffic. A vehicle on approaching the circulatory carriageway, seize the gap in the circulatory 
movement in order to enter the circular carriageway and always functions based on gap 
acceptance. Hence compliance to “Priority Rule” is vital for effective function of roundabout. 
On the other hand, a rotary intersection of large central island works on weaving, wherein 
a vehicle while entering need not necessarily wait on give way line, rather can merge to 
circulatory movement and then weave so as to change the lane. Weaving section of rotary 
has one more lane than non-weaving section. Table 4.1 presents key differences between 
roundabout and rotary. The need of gap acceptance in roundabout configuration can be 
appreciated from Fig. 4.1 whereas opportunities for weaving in rotary layout are depicted in 
Fig. 4.2.

Intersection Hierarchy
Generally the life cycle of a junction from at-grade intersection to grade separated intersection 
to interchange composed of roundabout and signalized intersections is depicted in Fig. 5.1. 
Moving from unsignalized intersections towards roundabout, channelization of traffic takes 
place and cross conflict points are converted into angular conflict points as all the vehicles 
move in clockwise direction. When the entering vehicle at the roundabout are finding difficulty 
to get suitable gap and delay starts occurring, signalization of roundabout can be a solution. 
Signalized roundabout is preferred at location where delay occurs during few hours of the 
day and in remaining maximum time, especially off-peak hour, it can work as conventional 
roundabout based on priority from right rule. Fig. 5.1 presents a general hierarchy of 
intersections and interchanges based upon the capacity handled.
Fig. 5.1 General Hierarchy of Intersections Based Upon Traffic Capacity
It can be observed that signalized intersections and roundabouts have an overlapping region 
where either of the forms of intersection can be used interchangeably based upon specific

Passenger Car Unit (PCU) for Roundabout
The PCU of any vehicle is a function of vehicular dimensions and speed of the vehicle only, in 
case of roundabouts, PCU is also dependent upon turning behavior and conflicts. The PCU 
value of different modes is dynamic in nature and also depends upon size of roundabout, 
share of heavy vehicles and overall traffic flow at intersection.
Based on the static and dynamic characteristics, the vehicles in an urban intersection can be 
classified as two wheelers, three wheelers, big cars, small cars, Light Commercial Vehicles 
(LCVs), trucks, buses, bicycles etc. The Passenger Car Units for different types of vehicles, 
based on five important parameters namely traffic flow, headway, conflict angle of vehicles 
negotiating the roundabout, vehicular speed and composition of traffic have been given in 
Table 5.2.

5.3	
Site Selection for Roundabouts
Roundabout may be an appropriate choice of traffic management in an at-grade intersection 
in following situations:
	
i)	
At intersections where traffic volumes on the intersecting roads are such 
that:
	
a)	
In case of “Stop” or “Give Way” signs or the “T” junction rule result 
in inordinate delays for the minor road traffic, roundabouts would 
decrease delays to minor road traffic, but increase delays to the major 
road traffic.
	
b)	
Traffic signals may result in greater delays than a roundabout. It shall 
be noted that in many situations roundabouts provide a similar capacity 
to that of signals, but may operate with lower delays and better safety, 
particularly in off-peak periods. 



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
12
	
ii) 	
At intersections where there are high proportions of right-turning traffic: 
Unlike most other intersection types, roundabouts can operate efficiently 
with high volumes of right-turning vehicles.
	
iii) 	
At rural cross intersections (including those in areas with high desired 
speeds) which are prone to accidents involving crossing or right turn (versus 
opposing) traffic. However, if the traffic flow on the lower volume road is less 
than about 200 vehicles per day, staggered “T” type intersection is preferred. 
	
iv)	
At intersections of arterial roads in outer urban areas where traffic speeds 
are high and right turning traffic flows are high. A roundabout could have an 
advantage over traffic signals in reducing right angle collision type accidents 
and also in reducing overall delays. 
	
v)	
At “T”, “Y” or cross intersections where the major traffic route turns through a 
right angle. In these situations, the major movements within the intersection 
are turning movements. 
	
vi)	
At locations where traffic growth is expected to be high and where future 
traffic patterns are uncertain.
	
vii) 	 At intersections of local roads where it is desirable not to give priority to other 
road. 
	
viii) 	 At intersections with more than four legs, if one or more legs cannot be 
closed or relocated or some turns prohibited, roundabouts may provide a 
convenient and effective solution whereas:
	
a)	
With “Stop” or “Give Way” signs, it is often not practical to define 
priorities adequately; 
	
b)	
Signals may be less efficient due to the large number of phases required 
resulting in a high percentage of queuing delay.
However, care should be taken in assessing the future traffic volumes and their patterns. It is 
possible that a site considered appropriate for a roundabout now, may become inappropriate 
in the future, requiring extensive modifications. Designers should consider the potential to 
build in flexibility in the design to accommodate possible future changes, particularly when 
land use alter traffic patterns considerably. Roundabout is not desirable at junction having 
considerable pedestrian crossing as pedestrian will not get priority to cross a roundabout 
junction, as traffic ply continuously. Roundabout requires more land than other intersection 
type of similar capacity, but would have very good safety performance.
6 Geometric Design
6.1	
Central Island and Circulatory Carriageway
The diameter of the roundabout is the diameter of the central island of roundabout/intersection 
for capacity and LoS estimation.

6.1.1	
Circulating Road width/Width of non-weaving section
It is the width of the carriageway used by the circulating traffic. It can also be defined as 
the width of the road from the edge of the central island to the edge of deflecting island. 
The width of the circulating carriageway depends on several factors, the most important of 
which are the number of circulating lanes and the radius of vehicle swept paths within the 
roundabout. Circulating road width is typically between 1.0 and 1.2 times the maximum entry 
width. Catering all these, Inscribed Circle Diameter and Circulatory Carriageway Width for 
different category of roundabout assuming 90˚ angle between approach arms and no more 
than four arms at intersection is given in Table 6.1.

6.1.2	
In order to ensure the maneuverability of design vehicle for single lane roundabout 
of Inscribed Circle Diameter (ICD) upto 40 m, a combination as given in Table 6.2 shall be 
followed between Inscribed Circle Diameter and Central Island Diameter. It is desirable to 
provide a Truck Apron for single lane roundabout having smaller Central Island Diameters, 
which would ensure adequate deflection for light vehicles.

6.2	
Positioning of Central Island
6.2.1	
Ideally the Central Island should be located in such a way that center lines of 
approach road passes through the center of Inscribed Circle. The size and position of Central 
Island shall be such that all approach vehicles will have to be deflected even that approaching 
from extreme left lane on the approach road.
6.2.2	
It is desirable to equally space the angle between entry arms of roundabout.
6.3	
Entry and Exit Design
The roundabout entry design depends upon various variables like entry width, entry flaring 
and entry angle.
6.3.1	
Entry Width
The entry width is the width of the carriageway at the point of entry. It is measured from the 
point “A” at the right hand end of the give way line along the normal to the nearside kerb as 
given in Fig. 6.1.
6.3.2	
One lane width at the give way line (measured along the normal to the nearside 
kerb, as for entry width) must be not less than 3 m or more than 4.5 m, with the 4.5 m value 
appropriate at single lane entries and values of 3 to 3.5 m appropriate at multilane entries.
6.3.3	
Exit Width
The exit width is the width of the carriageway on the exit and is measured in a similar manner 
to the entry width. It is the distance between the nearside kerb and the exit median (or the 
edge of any splitter island or central reserve) where it intersects with the outer edge of the 
circulatory carriageway.
6.3.4	
The downstream link in a undivided two way road with a long splitter island of 
a normal roundabout should be between 7 m and 7.5 m. The exit should taper down to a 
minimum of 6 m allowing traffic to pass a broken down vehicle. If the link is an all-purpose 
two-lane dual carriageway, the exit width should be between 10 m and 11 m and the exit 
should taper down to two lanes wide. The width should be reduced in such a way as to avoid 
exiting vehicles encroaching onto the opposing lane at the end of the splitter island. Normally 
the width would reduce at a taper of 1:15 to 1:20. Where the exit is on an up gradient, the exit 
width may be maintained for a short distance before tapering in.
6.3.5	
The carriageway width at entrance and exit of a roundabout is governed by the 
amount of traffic entering and leaving the roundabout. While deciding upon the width, the 
possible growth of traffic in the design period should be considered. It is recommended that 
the minimum width of carriageway be at least 5 m with necessary extra widening to account 
for the curvature of the road. Table 6.3 gives the value of the width of carriageway at entry 
inclusive of widening needed on account of curvature.

======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
15
6.3.6	
Radius of Entry Curve
It is measured as the minimum radius of curvature of the curve as shown in Fig. 6.1. The 
provision of an appropriate radius on the entry curve encourages drivers to slow down before 
reaching the roundabout. Radius of curve at the entry is critical for design speed, amount of 
superelevation and the coefficient of friction. The values of coefficient of friction for roundabout 
approaches shall be higher than for other locations. Based on overall considerations, Table 
6.3 gives guidance for the selection of radii of curves at entry.
6.3.7	
Radius of Exit Curve
It is measured as the minimum radius of curvature of the curve as shown in Fig. 6.1. Values 
for the exit kerb radius should exceed the largest entry radius. In areas where there are no 
pedestrians, the exit from a roundabout should be as easy to negotiate as practicable. After 
having been slowed down by the entry and circulating curves, vehicles should be able to 
accelerate on the exit. Therefore, the radius of the exit curve should generally be greater 
than the circulating radius. In areas where there are pedestrians, the exit speed should be 
minimized. The best solution to minimize the exit speed is to provide radii similar to those at 
entrances as given in Table 6.3.

6.4	
Splitter/Channelizing Islands
6.4.1	
Splitter and channelizing island are provided on each arm of roundabout to 
direct and separate opposing traffic movements onto and from a roundabout. Splitter island 
shall be of physical islands where there is sufficient space to accommodate kerbed island. 
Fig. 6.2 demonstrates the use of splitter islands on roundabout, which would prevent wrong 
right turning.
Fig. 6.2 Use of Splitter Islands to Discourage Hazardous Wrong Way Movements
6.4.2 	
Kerbed splitter islands should be provided on all approaches as they would provide 
shelter for pedestrians, assist in controlling entry speed, and guide traffic onto the roundabout 
and also deter right-turners from taking dangerous “wrong way” short cut movements through 
the roundabout.
6.4.3 	
On urban arterial road roundabouts, the kerbed splitter island should be of sufficient 
size to shelter a pedestrian (at least 2.4 m wide) and be highly visible to approaching traffic. 
A minimum area of 8 m2 to 10 m2 should be provided on any arterial road approach. On 
roundabout approaches from local roads, the general minimum area of kerbed splitter island 
is 5 m2 to 8 m2. In extremely constrained cases, it is preferable to provide a kerbed splitter 
island smaller than the general minimum rather than provide no island at all. 
6.4.4 	
In high speed areas the splitter island should also be relatively long to give early 
warning to drivers that they are approaching an intersection and must slow down. Preferably 
the splitter island and its approach pavement markings should extend back to a point where 
drivers would be expected to start to reduce their speed. 
6.4.5 	
The kerb line of splitter island or median in case of a divided carriageway should 
lie on arc which when projected forward meets the central island tangentially as shown in 
Fig. 6.3

Entry Flaring
Entry flaring is localized widening at the point of entry. Normal Roundabouts usually have 
flared entries with the addition of one or two lanes at the give way line to increase capacity. 
6.5.1	
The average effective flare length, l’, is the average length over which the entry 
widens. It is the length of the curve CF’, shown in Fig. 6.6

Fig. 6.6 Average Effective Flare Length 
6.5.2	
Procedure to determine the average effective flare length, l’: As shown in Fig. 6.6, 
construct curve GD parallel to the median HA (centre line or edge of central reserve or splitter 
island) and distance v from it; then construct curve CF’ parallel to curve BG (the nearside 
kerb) and at a constant distance of ½ BD from it, with F’ the point where CF’ intersects line 
DG. The length of curve CF’ is the average effective flare length l’. The total length of the 
entry widening (BG) will be about twice the average effective flare length.
6.5.3	
A minimum flare length of about 25 m is desirable, but capacity will be the 
determining factor. Effective flare lengths greater than 25 m may improve the geometric 
layout but have little effect in increasing capacity. If the effective flare length exceeds 100 m, 
the design becomes one of link widening
6.6	
Entry Angle
The entry angle, serves as a geometric proxy for the conflict angle between entering and 
circulating traffic streams. There are two different methods for its measurement, depending 
on the size of the roundabout.
6.6.1	
Procedure to determine to determine entry angle: For large roundabout like that 
given in Fig. 6.7 construct the curve EF as the locus of the mid- point between the nearside 
kerb and the median line (or the edge of any splitter island or central reserve); then construct 
BC as the tangent to EF at the give way line; construct the curve AD as the locus of the mid- 
point of (the used section of) the circulatory carriageway (a proxy for the average direction of 
travel for traffic circulating past the arm); the entry angle, Angle ACB is the entry angle

Fig. 6.7 Entry Angle at a Larger Roundabout
6.6.2 	
For Single Lane Roundabouts, the entry angle is measured as shown in Fig. 6.8. 
This construction is used when there is insufficient separation between entry and adjacent 
exit to be able to define the path of the circulating vehicle clearly. In this case, circulating 
traffic which leaves at the following exit will be influenced by the angle at which that arm joins 
the roundabout. The angle between the projected entry and exit paths is measured and then 
halved to find entry angle.
[Source: Design Manual for Roads & Bridges, UK, TD 16/07, 2007]
Fig. 6.8 Entry Angle at a Smaller Roundabout
6.6.3	
The entry angle should lie between 20 and 60. Entry angles should be larger than 
exit angle.
6.7	
Weaving Width in Rotary
The width of the weaving section of the rotary should be one traffic lane (3.5 m) wider than 
the mean entry width thereto as shown in Fig. 6.9

Design Speed
6.8.1	
Roundabouts operate at speeds lower than that of the network preceding and 
succeeding it as it requires give way behavior and gap acceptance. Generally, vehicles are 
expected not to run more than 30 km/h around urban roundabouts. Rural roundabouts may 
have higher operating speeds but still the speed of vehicles at roundabouts is expected to be 
lesser than that of mid-block sections. 
6.8.2	
Based upon sight distance and specific turning radius, the design speeds can be 
reduced but excessively reduced speeds may result into increased delay at roundabouts 
and in turn deteriorated level of service. Fig. 6.10 presents the typical relationship between 
operating speeds at roundabout and radius of Central Island.

Design Vehicle
6.9.1	
The design vehicle and consequently the swept path requirements may be different 
for various paths through the roundabout. Because travel through roundabouts involves 
complex reverse-turn movements, particular care is needed in the use of simple turning 
path templates to achieve a satisfactory layout. Fig. 6.11 and Table 6.4 shows turning width 
required for a Single Lane Roundabout for ICD diameter upto 36 m.
6.9.2	
A roundabout of Inscribed Circle Diameter from 28 m to 36 m can facilitate minimum 
turning radii requirement including U-turn for Design Vehicle upto Large Semi trailer Wheel 
Base (WB)-15 of 2.58 m overall width, 16.7 m overall length and 13.7 m minimum turning 
radius.

Path Alignment
6.10.1	
Drivers select their paths to obtain the largest possible radii (i.e. select their path 
to maximize their speed, as depicted in Fig. 6.12. It has been found that drivers typically 
travel to maintain the following distances between the edge of their vehicles and particular 
geometric features: 
	
•	
0.5 m from a road center-line.
	
•	
0.5 m from the face of concrete kerb and channeling, 
	
•	
0 m from a painted edge line or chevron. 
[Source: Design Manual for Roads & Bridges, UK, TD 16/07, 2007]
Fig. 6.12 Determination of Entry Path Radius for Ahead Movement at a 4-arm Roundabout
Assuming an average vehicle is 2 m wide, the following distances from the center line of the 
vehicle to the above geometric features result:
	
•	
1.5 m from a road center-line, 
	
•	
1.5 m from concrete kerb and 
	
•	
1 m from a painted edge line or chevron.
6.11	
Sight Distance
Sight distance is essentially the sight “triangle” (which may be on a curve) needed for a 
driver who does not have the right of way to perceive and react to a conflicting pedestrian, 
vehicle or bicyclist. Roundabouts have an advantage over standard intersections in that 
there are fewer conflicts to check for sight distance requirements. The minimum required 
sight distance is actually preferred in order to keep speeds low at the roundabout. Three sight 
distance principles must be applied to the combination of vertical and horizontal geometrics 
at roundabouts. These criteria affect the positioning of signs, landscaping, poles and other 
roadside furniture.

6.11.2	
Other Visibility Considerations 
A driver, stationary at the stopping line, should have a clear line of sight (using a passenger 
car eye height of 1.15 m) to traffic on any previous approach (an object height of 1.15 m 
passenger car eye height). The desirable minimum length of this line of sight is based on the 
distance travelled in 4 seconds (observation time plus reaction time) at the 85th percentile 
speed plus the stopping distance (measured along vehicle paths from previous approaches). 
The absolute minimum length of this line of sight is based on the distance travelled in 2.5 
seconds (observation time plus reaction time) at the 85th percentile speed plus the stopping 
distance. Desired and absolute minimum sight distance at 85th percentile speed is as given 
in Table 6.6.

It is preferable to position a roundabout in a sag rather on a crest. It is important 
to avoid placing a roundabout just over a crest where the layout is obscured from the view of 
approaching drivers.

6.11.7	
At grade separated roundabouts, particularly where there may be a structure (e.g. 
pier) in the central island which might obstruct a driver’s visibility, care must be taken to 
ensure that the sight distance requirements are met. Any safety barriers used to protect 
piers, structures, embankments etc. may also interfere with visibility and must be located to 
avoid this interference 
6.12	
Grade of Intersecting Road
A roundabout should preferably be located on level ground. It may be sited to lie on a plane 
which is inclined to the horizontal at not more than 1 in 50. It is, however, not desirable 
that a roundabout be located in two planes having different inclinations to the horizontal. A 
roundabout may, with advantages be located on a summit. Such locations assist deceleration 
while approaching and acceleration while leaving the roundabout. 
For roundabouts in valleys always provide a full view to the approaching vehicles, but are 
likely to induce greater approaching speeds and have drainage difficulties.

6.13.2	
Camber for Rotary and Bigger Roundabout
For all roundabout with ICD above 40 m and rotary, since the curvature is opposite to that of 
entry and exit, vehicles, especially heavy buses and trucks, experience difficulty in changing 
over from one cross-slope to another in the opposite direction. It is, therefore, recommended 
that the algebraic difference in the cross-slopes be limited to about 5%. The super-elevation 
should be limited to the least amount consistent with design speed. The crown-line which is 
the line of meeting of opposite cross-slopes should, as far as possible, be located such that 
vehicles cross it while travelling along the common tangent to the reverse curve. Channelizing 
islands should be situated on the peak with the road surfaces sloping away from them to 
all sides. Whenever possible, the cross-slope at an entrance should be carried around on 
the outer edge of the roundabout to the adjacent exit, altering the slope slightly to suit the 
curvature in the rotary and the exit. A typical disposition of cross-slopes in a roundabout is 
indicated in Fig. 6.18.

6.14	
Drainage
Drainage at roundabout is a crucial part of planning and design. The reasons to provide a 
sound and long-lasting drainage system are:
	
•	
To prevent flooding of the road and ponding on the road surface.
	
•	
To protect the bearing capacity of the pavement and the sub grade material.
	
•	
To avoid the erosion of side slopes.

Drainage” and IRC:SP:50 “Guidelines on Urban Drainage”.

kerbs. The height of the kerb of the central island shall not be more than 225 mm and shall 
be non-mountable type. Utmost care shall be given that visibility shall not be obscured. 
The kerbs at the outer edges of rotary and at the approach roads should preferably be of the 
vertical type. The approaches should be provided with kerbs up to a minimum distance of 30 
m from the point where the flaring of the approach starts.

safeguard and guide to uninterrupted traffic. The Lane marking and signing may be provided 
as per the guidelines given in IRC 35 “Code of Practice for Road Markings” and IRC:67 
“Code of Practice for Road Signs” respectively. Fig. 6.19 and Fig. 6.20 show a typical sign

Pedestrians
It is essential that splitter islands (or medians) are provided for pedestrian crossing. In the 
planning and design of roundabouts special consideration should be given to the movement of 
pedestrians. Roundabouts are at least as safe for pedestrians as other forms of intersections. 
This is possible as pedestrians are able to cross one direction of traffic at a time by staging 
on the splitter islands. However, pedestrians must cross with care because, unlike traffic 
signals, roundabouts do not give priority to pedestrians over through traffic movements. 
To minimize pedestrian accidents at crossings of entries and exits, the entry and exit speeds 
should be kept low. The best solution to achieve this is to provide small radius entry and exit 
curves. 
Consideration may be given to providing priority crossings (e.g. zebra crossings), for 
pedestrians where:
	
•	
Pedestrian volumes are high;
	
•	
There is a high proportion of young, elderly or senior citizens wanting to 
cross the road; or



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
30
	
•	
Pedestrians are experiencing difficulty in crossing and are getting delayed 
excessively. 
Other design considerations to enhance pedestrian safety at roundabouts include: 
	
•	
Designing splitter islands which are as large as the site allows;
	
•	
Prohibiting parking on the approaches to the roundabouts to provide clear 
visibility;
	
•	
Providing street lighting which illuminates not only the circulating carriageways 
but also the approaches; and
	
•	
Locating signs and vegetation so as not to obscure “small” users of the road 
such as pedestrians. 
However, where pedestrian volumes are high, serious consideration should be given to the 
use of an alternative intersection treatment. This is especially true where the pedestrian 
traffic consists of school children or the elderly. For the sake of universal accessibility and 
intimation to the road users, various surface treatment options and table top crossing can be 
provided.
7.2	
Cyclists
Roundabouts can be designed to provide an acceptable level of safety for cyclists. However, 
the extent to which special geometric treatments and/or traffic control measures are needed 
to achieve an adequate level of safety will depend on:
	
•	
The daily vehicle traffic volume and the peak hour flows;
	
•	
The proportion of cyclists in the total traffic stream;
	
•	
The functional classification of the roads involved and
	
•	
The overall traffic management strategies for the location. 
Reducing the relative speed between entering and circulating vehicles, minimizing the 
number of circulating lanes, and maximizing the distance between approaches reduces the 
entering/circulating vehicle accident rates at roundabouts. These design concepts will also 
minimize entering/circulating vehicle accidents involving cyclists. 
Separate cycle paths are safer than a bicycle lane within the road carriageway, particularly at 
highly trafficked roundabouts. This treatment has the added advantage of restricting widths 
through the roundabout enabling better entry curvature and deflection to be obtained. 
Specific provision is not generally required at single lane roundabouts where vehicle speeds 
through the roundabout are less than 40 km/h. Special provision for cyclists is desirable 
where: 
	
•	
The cumulative, approach traffic volume, exceeds 10,000 vehicles per day;
	
•	
There is a multi-lane roundabouts; or
	
•	
Vehicle speeds exceed 50 km/h through the roundabout.

Photo 7.1 Roundabout with Separated Bicycle Lanes
This can be achieved by:
	
•	
Providing a path of access for cyclists separated from the road carriage way 
as an alternative to the use of the road carriageway at the roundabout. In 
most instances, and particularly in the case of large roundabouts, it would 
be desirable for the path to be two-way, in order to provide cyclists with a 
convenient choice of route to the road carriageway, and hence encourage as 
many cyclists as possible to use the facility. 
	
•	
Using footpaths located adjacent to the roundabout where separate provision 
is not possible. Fencing or landscaping between the path and carriage way, 
is necessary to prevent ‘ride-out’;
	
•	
Providing traffic signals for one or all entries to a roundabout, depending 
on the predominant paths of cyclists and other traffic or depending on the 
accident history;
	
•	
Providing a controlled crossing on critical approaches of very large 
roundabouts on busy roads or grade separation where cyclist demand is 
very high. A Live example is given in Photo 7.1 and also Fig. 7.1 where 
separate cycle path in a rotary location is shown.

Critical Gap
Critical gap represents the minimum time interval in the circulating flow when an entering 
vehicle from approach can safely enter a roundabout. Thus, the driver’s critical gap is the 
minimum gap that would be acceptable. A particular driver would reject gaps less than the 
critical gap and would accept gaps greater than or equal to the critical gap. Critical gap can 
be estimated on the basis of observations of the largest rejected and smallest accepted gap 
for a given intersection. Gap features:
	
•	
A gap is defined as the time span between two consecutive circulating 
vehicles that create conflict with an entering vehicle.
	
•	
The described time span is measured only when the entering driver is at the 
give way line when the gap begins.
	
•	
All gaps less than the critical gap would be rejected and all gaps greater than 
or equal to the critical gap would be accepted.

8.2	
Follow-up Time
The time between the departure of one vehicle from the approach and the departure of the 
next vehicle using the same gap in circulating flow, under a condition of continuous queuing 
condition, is called the follow-up time. It is the headway that defines the saturation flow rate 
for the approach if there were no conflicting vehicles on movements of higher rank. In order 
to calculate entry capacity, it is required to calculate the critical gap and follow-up time for 
the roundabout. The critical gap and follow-up time at a roundabout primarily vary with the 
diameter of the roundabout. For the purpose of planning and design, the values of critical gap 
and follow-up time parameters for roundabouts of different diameters evolved based on the 
studies done across 18 roundabouts are presented in Table 8.1.

Lag 
A lag is the time span between an entering vehicle and opposing circulating vehicle. Many 
studies have shown that it is acceptable practice to combine lags and gaps into one data set 
for analysis.

8.4	
Forced Gap 
A forced gap occur when a vehicle enter the roundabout without giving enough consideration 
of the circulating traffic. The entering vehicles force themselves into the roundabout and 
circulating vehicles have to slow down or even stop to not crash into the entering vehicle. 
Forced gaps are mainly used by lorries that have trouble entering the roundabout due to lack 
of sufficient gaps.
8.5	
Static Entrance
If a vehicle has to stop at the give way sign and wait for a sufficient gap to occur before 
entering the roundabout it is marked as static entrance.
8.6	
Floating Entrance 
If the driver finds a gap and does not have to stop at the give way sign the vehicle is defined 
as floating. It is only the first vehicle entering a gap that is a floating vehicle, the succeeding 
vehicles are follow-ups.
9 Capacity Estimation
This section presents the process for determining the entry capacity of roundabout. The 
maximum flow rate that can be accommodated at a roundabout entry depends on two factors 
namely, the circulating flow on the roundabout that conflicts with the entry flow and the 
geometric elements of the roundabout. 
When the circulating flow is low, drivers at the entry are able to enter the roundabout without 
significant delay. The larger gaps in the circulating flow are more useful to the entering 
vehicles and more than one vehicle may enter each gap. As the circulating flow increases, 
the size of the gaps in the circulating flow decrease, and the corresponding rate at which 
vehicles can enter also decreases.
Similarly, the geometric elements of the roundabout also affect the rate of entry flow. The 
most important geometric element is the width of the entry and circulatory roadways, or 
the number of lanes at the entry on the roundabout. Two entry lanes permit nearly twice 
the rate of entry flow as that of a single lane. Wider circulatory roadways allow vehicles 
to travel alongside, or follow, each other in tighter bunch and so provide longer gaps 
between bunches of vehicles. The flare length also affects the capacity. The inscribed 
circle diameter and the entry angle have minor effects on capacity. The capacity of 
roundabout is a function of entry flow and circulating flow. As driver behavior appears 
to be the significant variable affecting roundabout performance, consideration of critical 
gap and follow-up time is highly recommended to produce accurate capacity estimates. 
The following exponential model from US HCM (2010) can be used by the analyst for the 
estimation of entry capacity of roundabout:

10 Delay
The overall performance of roundabout is assessed with respect to total delay an individual 
vehicle experience while maneuvering through the roundabout. Sample speed profile along 
a network comprising of roundabout is shown in Fig. 10.1.
Fig. 10.1 Sample Speed Profile Along a Network Comprising of Roundabout
The different types of delay observed by maneuvering vehicles at roundabout is as follows: 
	
•	
Queuing delay - The delay to drivers waiting to accept a gap in the circulating 
traffic. 
	
•	
Geometric Delay - The delay to drivers slowing down to stop at the end of 
the queue and, after accepting a gap, accelerating to the negotiation speed, 
proceeding through the roundabout and then finally accelerating further to 
reach normal operating speed. It excludes the time to wait for an acceptable 
gap.

The estimation of LoS is based on the vehicular delay model derived from studies conducted 
at 11 roundabouts by taking into account the delay experienced by the vehicle from entry 
point to reach the exit point of the roundabout. 
The delay model empirically derived is as under:
y= 0.8*e0.001x	 	
	
	
 (Eq 11.1)
Where,
y= Vehicular Delay in seconds.

established by using clustering technique to represent the quality of traffic flow on roundabout. 
Accordingly, LoS for the roundabout are given in Table 11.1. If the volume to capacity (v/c) 
ratio of a lane exceeds 1.0 regardless of the delay, the LoS of the roundabout is defined as F.

12 Illumination
In view of safety and security, streets should be well lighted. The roundabout must not be 
left unlit with one or more approaches being lit. Otherwise the driver may not be able to 
see the unlit roundabout while coming from a lit up approach arm. Reflective markers and 
signs should be used on the central island. Any raised islands or kerbing should also be 
illuminated if possible. Otherwise, reflective markers are a must. The exit arms should have 
an ‘illumination transition zone’ where the intensity of lighting gradually decreases. When 
the driver exits the well illuminated roundabout, he/she should be able to adapt to the dark 
environment of the exiting arm.
A lot of vehicles go out of control on roundabouts. So, adequate clear zones should be 
maintained so that there are no hazards for such vehicles. Therefore, lighting poles should 
not be placed on small channel islands and left hand perimeter just exiting from the 
roundabout. For details on illumination, reference may be made to IRC:SP:90 “Manual for 
Grade Separators & Elevated Structures”.
13 Landscaping
The form and layout of the roundabout should not get obscured to the driver; therefore use 
of appropriate plantation is required. The central island should appear prominent, so that 
the driver is able to distinguish the central island from the surroundings. Small Channel 
Islands should not have trees planted on them. Landscaping must be done carefully so as to 
maintain the clear line of sight. 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
39
The plantation along the approach and exit arm should be low in height so as to maintain a 
clear line of sight for the driver. Large, fixed landscape elements such as big trees, rocks, 
sculptures, etc. should be avoided in areas vulnerable to vehicle run off. Landscaping in corner 
radii areas should be done to channelize pedestrians to crosswalk areas and discourage 
pedestrians from jaywalking or from crossing to the central island.
For more details on clearances, reference may be made to IRC:SP:21 “Guidelines on 
Landscaping and Tree Plantation”.
Fig. 13.1 Typical landscape details on roundabout.
14 Safety
14.1	
General Considerations
In general, a well-designed roundabout is the safest type of intersection. ‘Before and after’ 
type studies have shown that in general, fewer vehicle accidents occur at roundabouts than 
at intersections containing traffic signals, stop or give way signs. The primary reason for this 
is that the potential relative speeds of vehicles are considerably lower for a well-designed 
roundabout than for other types of at-grade intersections. 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
40
Conversely, a poorly designed roundabout with little entry curvature or deflection results 
in high speeds through the roundabout creating high potential relative speeds between 
vehicles. Multiple vehicle accident rates at these roundabouts can actually be higher than for 
an equivalent at-grade intersection. Therefore it is important to give special attention to the 
design of the geometry of roundabouts. 
Within the context of low overall accident rates for roundabouts, single vehicle accident rates 
at roundabouts are high compared to other intersection types. This is because roundabouts 
consist of a number of relatively small radii horizontal curves for each travelled path through 
the roundabout. Drivers travel on these curves with quite high speed. Single vehicle accidents, 
which predominantly involve out-of-control vehicles, increase as the required amount of side 
friction decreases. 
Because of the relatively high number of out-of-control vehicles, it is desirable to have 
adequate amounts of clear zone where there are no roadside hazards on each side of the 
carriageway. Roadside hazards common at roundabouts include light and power poles, large 
trees and sign supports etc. If roadside hazards cannot be located outside the required clear 
zone, consideration should be given to making them frangible. If it is not possible to remove 
roadside hazards or make them frangible, protecting them with safety barriers are a hazard in 
themselves and are the least desirable option. In addition, safety barriers in the vicinity of the 
holding line often obscure visibility to circulating vehicles. Central lighting is often preferred 
for this reason as well as for economy. 
14.2	
Speed Control 
14.2.1	
The entering/circulating vehicle accident rate on any particular approach is 
largely related to the potential relative speed of entering and circulating vehicles. Minimizing 
the potential relative speed of entering and circulating vehicles will minimize the entering/
circulating vehicle accident rate. The potential relative speed of entering and circulating 
vehicles should be limited to 40 km/h.
14.2.2	
The potential relative speed of entering and circulating vehicles on any particular 
approach can be reduced by:
	
o	
Reducing the entry curve radius. 
	
o	
Providing a smaller radius entry curve on the preceding approach arm. 
	
o	
Providing greater deflection through the roundabout. 
	
o	
Increasing the central island diameter. 
	
o	
Providing more separation between arms.
	
o	
Decreasing the entry and exit widths.



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:65-2017
41
14.2.3	
The exiting/circulating vehicle accident rate at any particular exit point of multi-lane 
roundabouts is predominantly related to the potential relative speed of exiting and circulating 
vehicles. Minimizing the relative speed of exiting and circulating vehicles will minimize the 
exiting/circulating vehicle accident rate. 
14.2.4	
Speed Consistency can be achieved by following general guidance given in 
Fig. 14.1, where R1 is the entry path radius on the fastest through path, R2 is the circulating 
path radius, R3 is the exit path radius, R4 is the Right turn path radius and R5 is the left turn. 
In the fastest path, it is desirable that entry path radius R1 to be smaller than R2. Exit Radius 
R3 should not be less than R1 or R2 to minimize loss of control crashes. Radius of right turn 
R4 ensure that maximum speed difference between entering R1 and circulating R2 is no 
more than 20 kmpkh. The fastest left turn R5 shall be below the roundabout design speed 
and not more than 20 kmph of conflicting R4 path radius.
