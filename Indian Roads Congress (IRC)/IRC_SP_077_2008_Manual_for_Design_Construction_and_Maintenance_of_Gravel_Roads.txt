1.2.
Global Acceptance for Low Volume Traffic
1.2.1.
Internationally, the unpaved roads
(i.e. roads without bituminous or cement
concrete
surfacing)
constitute
a
sizable
proportion of the
total
road
length.
In
several
countries, the unpaved road length
is more than the paved road length, as can be seen in
Fig. 1.1.
In India, however, the unpaved road length constitutes less than half the total road
length (Fig. 1.2.). While in most countries abroad, among the unpaved roads,
it is the Gravel
Roads,
which
are
most
popular,
the
unpaved
roads
in
India
are
generally WBM
surfaced. More recently, especially with the World Bank assistance in some rural areas of I n d i a
Gravel Roads showing good performance even after about 5 years of service have begun to earn
the confidence ofrural road engineers in the country.

1.2.2. As per AASHTO 'For the aggregate
surfaced (Gravel) roads (used for many
county
and
forest
roads),
the maximum
traffic
level
considered
is
100,000 ESAL
applications' and "The
practical minimum
traffic
level
that can be
considered
for any
flexible
or
rigid
pavement
during
a
given
performance
period
is
about
50,000
applications". Assuming that commercial vehicles constitute about 25% of the number of
vehicles
plying
per
day
(and
that
the
heavy
commercial
vehicles/trucks
constitute 20% of all commercial vehicles per day). Gravel Roads are suitable for anADT
upto
200 vehicles day. Further,
it implies that unless the daily traffic is of the order of about 125
vehicles per day, paved road (flexible or rigid pavement) is not justified. A recent study shows
that for traffic upto 200 vehicles per day Gravel Roads have lower maintenance costs compared
to black topped roads.

IRC:SP:77-2008
1.2.3. There are several access roads providing connectivity to smaller habitations with
a
traffic volume that is likely to be much lower than 200 vehicles per day. In such situations, the
most suitable and economical option that emerges is the provision of an aggregate surfaced
(gravel) road. It may be appreciated that after the current programme of providing all-weather
access to habitations with a population over 500 has been completed, substantial inputs will still
be required to provide all-weather access to the smaller habitations with a population less than
500, where the traffic generated would generally be of a much lower order justifying provision
ofGravel Roads as a first stage option from both technical and economic considerations.
1.3.
Life Cycle andAmenability to Stage Development
1.3.1.
It is also estabhshed that well-engineered Gravel Roads perform satisfactorily
for low
volume traffic conditions provided the needed routine and periodic maintenance are attended to promptly.
For most situations, the maintenance requirements are frequent but inexpensive. As in the case ofblack -
topped roads, where bituminous surface renewals are required
after about every 5 to 6 years or so
dependingon traflSc, the Gravel Roads too require re-gravelling periodically. If the periodic re-gravelling
requirement is attended to a design life of 10 years canbe considered forpurposes ofpavement design. For
many low-volume traflSc conditions
e.g., on Unk roads connecting habitations of relatively lower
population levels. Gravel Roads can continue to serve for long periods of time. If, however, the traffic
volume and axle loads increase to a level beyond the traffic load carrying capacity ofa Gravel Road and its
serviceability level comes down close to the terminal serviceabihty level, strengthening / rehabilitation
with an overlay canbe easily implementedto bring it topavedroad standards.
1.3.2. Thus, one ofthe biggest advantages of initially adopting a Gravel Road option for
low volume traffic conditions is its amenability to providing a thin bituminous surface treatment
or strengthening the pavement crust followed by black topping as may be warranted by
increased traffic. If a Gravel Road needs to be black
topped as warranted by increased traffic
and environmental conditions, the bituminous surface treatment can be provided over the gravel
base after suitably preparing the surface of the existing gravel base and priming
it as per
specified
procedure.
Where
warranted
by
increased
traffic
considerations,
structural
strengthening by way ofan overlay ofgravel /WBM/WMM etc. layer can be provided, treating
the existing gravel base as a lower base course or a sub base.
1 .4.
Techno-Socio-Economic Aspects
1.4.1. The technical aspects of adopting a Gravel Road option for low volume rural
roads include the maximized use of the low cost locally available materials and deployment of
low-cost low-capacity equipment/plant both
for construction and maintenance. Thus
the
requirements of materials, plant and equipment for construction and maintenance can be
accomplished within the available resources and skills in rural areas. Since no bituminous
surface treatment is envisaged at least during the initial few years of its
service life, there is no
requirement of expensive bituminous materials or the hot mix plants and equipment for manu-
facture, laying and compaction ofthe bituminous mix.
1.4.2. Studies carried out under the aegis of IRC in nine selected districts on socio-
economic impact ofrural roads show that a number of social benefits (like access to education and
4



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
health faciHty etc.) and economic benefits (improved transportation of agricultural produce,
higher yield / acre, quick transportation of perishable crops etc.) accrue from the provision of
rural roads. Social and economic benefits accrued from all-weather unpaved gravel roads are
practically the same as for black topped roads.
1,5.
Influence ofEnvironmental Conditions on Performance
Gravel Roads for low volume traffic conditions in rural areas work out to be the most
suitable and economical option only under certain environmental conditions. These are:-
1.5.1.
Availability of quality gravel within economic
leads: Where
the
locally
available gravels meet the specified requirements of grading and plasticity for use
in the
gravel
base
and
surfacing
as
such,
without
any
further
processing,
and
are
available
within short leads, say less than 5 to 10 km, Gravel Roads would generally work out to be the
most
preferred
alternative.
However,
where
further
processing
by
way
of
blending
with
other
local
materials
or by
lime/cement
treatment
is
required,
the
related
costs
should be worked out and compared with the cost of other low-cost alternatives like paving with
bricks,
stones,
cement
concrete
blocks,
as
feasible.
Similarly
when
the
distance of haulage of gravel is too long, the cost of haulage must be considered and compared
with the cost ofother alternatives.
0
1.5.2. Rainfall: High intensity of rainfall causes high gravel loss on a gravel road as also
when the total annual rainfall is high,
i.e.
over 1500-2000 mm per year. However,
it is more
meaningful
to
consider
the
combined
effect
of
traffic
and
rainfall
on
the
rate
of
deterioration of a gravel road surface. Although no systematic performance records of gravel
roads
for
different
amounts
of
rainfall
are
available,
it
is
observed
that
under
high
amount of rainfall, over 1500 mm/ year, a Gravel Road can take upto 100 vehicles per day; for
medium rainfall of 1000-1500 mm per year, a Gravel Road can take upto 150 vehicles per day
while for low rainfall less than 1 000 mm, a Gravel Road can take upto 200 vehicles per day.
1.5.3. Prolonged dry seasons: In areas with prolonged dry seasons, say 8 months or
more ofdry periods during a year, the gravel surface loses, under traffic or by wind, the very fine-
sized particles which provide the binding at the surface. As a result, dust nuisance is caused all
around the unsealed road. In such situations,
it becomes necessary to use dust palliatives.
If,
however, the cumulative cost ofproviding dust palliatives works out to be higher than the cost of
sealing the surface, a low cost thin bituminous surface treatment can be resorted to.
1.5.4. Longitudinal gradients: In the low rainfall regions, with less than 1000 mm/year,
the longitudinal gradients should not be steeper than 6%. Where the rainfall is in the range of
1 000 to 1 500 mm/year, the longitudinal gradients should not be steeper than 5%, provided proper
precautions are taken to prevent erosion.
1.5.5. Traffic volume: When the traffic volume is upto 100 vehicles per day, (excluding
2-wheelers), Gravel Roads are considered suitable except in case ofvery poor subgrade. Where
the traffic volume is upto 150 vehicles per day (excluding two-wheelers). Gravel Roads are
considered suitable except for the weak subgrades upto CBR of 4. For traffic upto 200 vehicles
per day (excluding 2-wheers), Gravel Roads are suitable for subgrades with CBR of 5 and above.
For traffic volume above 200 vehicles per day (excluding two-wheelers). Gravel Roads are not
5



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
considered suitable.
1.6. The Problems ofLocal Moorums, Maintenance & Dust Control
1.6.1. Local moorums: In India, the term 'Moorum' is commonly used to define soils and
gravels ofcertain types. Contrary to this belief, there is no soil group termed as 'Moorum' in
the
Indian Soil Classification System or any such classification system internationally.
1.6.1.1. It is, therefore, not only desirable but necessary that moorum samples fi"om any
source and
at
various
depths from
that
source must
first be
classified
as
per
the
Soil
Classification system before considering them for use in a Gravel Road. It may be pointed out
here that many 'moorums' do not even classify as 'Gravels' by the IS Soil Classification System; in
fact, several varieties when tested for their particle size distribution and their Liquid and Plastic
Limits, get classified as 'Clayey Sands' (SC).
1.6.1.2. As per the Indian Soil Classification system, any soil sample that has more than
half its weight retained on IS:75 micron sieve is a coarse-grained soil. If any coarse-grained soil
has more than half the weight of its coarse fraction retained on IS sieve of 4.75 mm size, it is a
'Gravel', denoted by the symbol "G".
All Gravels are further classified as under, by the Indian
Soil Classification System:
•
Well-graded Gravels GW
Uniformity Coefficient>4
(Percent Fines>5%)
•
Poorly-graded Gravels GP
Not Satisfying GW requirements
(Percent Fines<5%)
•
Silty Gravels GM
(Percent Fines> 12%)
•
Clayey Gravels GC
(Percent Fines> 12%)
As per the specified requirements, only the gravels classified as GW and GP may be suitable for
use in Gravel Base Courses while GM an GC types are not suitable. For use in Gravel Surfacings,
GM and GC may or may not be suitable whileGW and GP are generally unsuitable.
1.6.1.3. In view of the above,
it is absolutely necessary for any Gravel Road project,
before incorporating
local moorums
that representative samples from each source and
at
different depths be tested for their particle size distribution through standard set of sieves and for
their liquid limit and plastic limit values. From the classification test data thus obtained, it would
be possible to classify them by the Indian Standard Soil Classification System.
It
is only
depending on the classification/soil groups to which
the local moorums belong, that it would be
possible to decide whether these can be used as such or only after further processing in lubbase,
base or surfacing. Where further processing is required, the related costs should be worked out in
detail. Comparing the cost of local moorums after processing, with the cost of other alternative
low-cost materials like bricks, stone blocks etc, a decision may be arrived at in favour ofthe most
suitable and economical alternative

1.6.2. Maintenance and dust control
1.6.2.1. The performance of Gravel Roads
is mainly dependent on the quality of
materials available for road construction, environmental conditions, proper maintenance and
available resources. The main factors
for rapid deterioration of Gravel Roads include
(i)
availability and suitability of gravel (ii) construction standards (iii) environmental and climatic
conditions (iv) drainage and (v) traffic. If adequate attention is not given to these factors, the
adverse effects on the performance of a Gravel Road are much more serious compared to the
performance of black-topped roads. Timely maintenance is crucial in the upkeep of Gravel
Roads. While the maintenance cost increases with
traffic,
still
it
is
less compared to the
maintenance cost ofbituminous roads for low volumes oftraffic upto about 200 vehicles per day.
Gravel Roads suffer from loss ofgravel, which increases with the use of inferior gravels and also
suffer deformation ofthe transverse profile. While deformations in the transverse profile need to
be rectified by periodic grading, excessive loss ofgravel would require frequent regravelling.
1.6.2.2. Another problem associated with Gravel Roads
is the dust nuisance in low
rainfall regions,
particularly when
the
surface
gravel
does
not
have
adequate
binding
properties.
In many
countries,
dust
Palliatives
have been
successfully used
to
control
dust
nuisance
in
such
situations.
These
aspects
have
been
dealt
with
in
detail
in
Section 4 of this Manual.
In
certain
situations,
eventually bituminous
sealing may be
warranted to overcome this problem.
1.7.
Warrants for Sealing
1.7.1. Pneumatic tyred fast moving vehicles like the commercial rural vehicles damage
unprotected granular base and create dust nuisance. Also, the
operating costs of such vehicles
are highly influenced by the smoothness of the road pavement. Bituminous surfacing will be
advantageous (i) where subgrade is very poor (CBR=2) and the traffic is in the range of30,000 to
60,000 ESAL applications (ii) where subgrade is poor (CBR less than 4) and the design traffic is
in the range of 60,000 to 1,00,000 ESAL applications and (iii)
irrespective of the subgrade
strength, the design traffic is over 1 00,000 ESAL applications.
1.7.2. As part of the stage development strategy,
it is often desirable to postpone the
provision of a bituminous surface treatment for the first few years of its service life during
which the pavement may undergo any undulations and the entire pavement system, including the
drainage system gets stabilized. Surface dressing is considered the most suitable and economical
surface treatment. It is always desirable to have some time gap between the application of first
coat and the second coat.
1.8.
Potential for Large Scale Applications and Employment Generation
1 .8.1 .
In view ofthe fact that many ofour rural roads are mainly "farm to market" roads,
the design traffic is of a very low order and Gravel Roads can adequately cater to such low
volumes of traffic. After the current PMGSY targets are achieved, the remaining about
1 .7 lakh
unconnected habitations with population below 500 will generate even lower volumes oftraffic.
For such volumes oftraffic. Gravel Roads can be quite suitable.
1.8.2. The provision of Gravel Roads involving community participation can generate
tremendous employment
opportunities not only
for
their construction but
also
for
their

maintenance. Furthemiore, Gravel Roads would go a long way in capacity building of small
local contractors and towards evolving appropriate technology utilizing the increasing number
of agricultural tractors for towing water bowsers and trailers, for haulage of materials, simple
implements like disc harrows for pulverization of soil clods, rotavators for blending locally
available materials and mixing of soil with stabilizers and water etc.
1.8.3.
It is well established that the labour cost component of the total cost of the black
topped conventional pavement is much lower than the labour cost component ofthe total cost of
a
Gravel
Road.
The
construction
of
a
Gravel
Road
maximises
the
use
of
locally
available materials and adoption of semi-mechanized construction techniques, thus offering
significant employment opportunities to the local communities.
Although the frequent maintenance requirements are often cited as a negative
aspect of providing Gravel Roads in rural areas, in fact these requirements may be considered a
big plus point in as much as they provide significant employment opportunities under various
employment generating programmes of the Central and State Governments, particularly the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme.
1.9.
Demonstration Projects
1.9.1.
Keeping
in view
that hardly any well-engineered Gravel Roads
are being
constructed
in
India
and
that
such
roads
are
extremely
popular
abroad,
ftill-scale
demonstration projects are warranted. If the construction and maintenance of Gravel Roads is
demonstrated
in
each
state,
such
an
experience
would
go
a
long
way
in
popularizing Gravel Roads for the low traffic volume conditions in rural areas. It is necessary to
get
a feedback on the performance of well-engineered Gravel Roads, constructed under
different sets of environmental conditions. Data on road condition rating (in terms of PCI),
traffic, specific routine and periodic maintenance measures taken and their frequency should all
be recorded systematically.
2. DESIGN OF GRAVEL ROADS
2.1.
Geometric Design Standards
2.1.1.
Roadway width: For the single-lane gravel roads, the roadway width shall be a
minimum 7.5 m in plain and rolling terrain. However, where the traffic intensity is less than 100
motorised
vehicles
per
day
and
where
the
traffic
is
not
likely
to
increase
due
to
situation, like dead end etc., the roadway width shall be reduced to 6.0 m. In the mountainous and
steep terrain, the roadway width shall be 6.0 m.
2.1.2.
Carriageway width: For the single-lane gravel roads, the carriageway width
shall be a minimum 3.75 m. However, where the traffic intensity is less than 100 motorised
vehicles per day and where the traffic is not likely to increase due to situations like dead end etc.
or in difficult terrain condition, the carriageway width shall be reduced to 3 .0 m.
2.1.3.
Camber on carriageway: For gravel roads, the camber shall be 3.5% ( 1 in 30) for
annual rainfall less than 1 000 mm and 4.0% ( 1 in 25) for annual rainfall over 1 000 mm.
8



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
2.1.4.
Crossfall on shoulders: On earthen shoulders, the crossfall should be 1%
more than the camber for carriageway.
2.1.5. Longitudinal gradients: Due to the sizable proportion of slow-moving vehicles
on gravel roads in rural areas and due to increased gravel loss on steeper gradients, it is necessary
to impose restrictions on longitudinal gradients. In plain and rolling terrain, the ruling gradient
shall be 3.5% and the limiting gradient of 5.0%, which can be relaxed upto 6%, where annual
rainfall is less than 1 000 mm. In mountainous and steep terrain, the ruling gradient shall be 5.0%
and the limiting gradient of6%.
2.1.6.
Horizontal alignment:
The requirements of minimum
radii of horizontal
curves, superelevation rates etc. for low-volume rural roads as contained in IRC: 73 shall be
adopted for gravel roads. Due to the predominance of slow-moving animal drawn cart traffic on
gravel roads in rural areas, the maximum superelevation shall be restricted to 0.07.
2.2.
Materials
2.2.1. Roadmaking gravels: Roadmaking gravel has been defined as 'a mix of stone,
sand and fine-sized particles used as sub-base, base or surfacing on a road'. As per the IS Soil
Classification System,'Graver is a coarse-grained soil (with more than half the total material
coarser than 0.075 mm size), having more than halfthe 'coarse fi-action' (larger than 0.075 mm),
coarser than 4.75 mm. Sand is a coarse-grained soil with more than halfthe coarse fraction, finer
than 4.75 mm. Silt and Clay are fine-grained soils with more than half the total material finer
than 0.075 mm. It is not always possible to find a suitable roadmaking gravel in a natural deposit
and
often
the
naturally
occurring
gravels have
to be processed
to meet
the
specified
requirements for use in a gravel road. There are few natural deposits of material that have an
ideal gradation without being processed.
2.2.2. Grading requirements
2.2.2.1. As per the MORD Specifications, the gradation requirements of gravel/soil-
aggregate for use in base and surface courses of a gravel road are given in Tables 2.1 and 2.2
respectively. Any ofthe 3 gradings given in Table 2.1 for Base Course can be adopted depending
upon the availability of materials. These gradings are recommended in case the gravel is sealed
by chip sealing or surface dressing using bituminous material.

Gravel for base courses should have very small proportion of fine materials (silt and
clay) and a relatively larger top-sized aggregate for strength and durability. Surface gravel
should have a relatively higher percentage of fines (silt and clay) and relatively smaller top-
sized aggregate, so as to readily shed offwater falling on the surface ofthe Gravel Road. Where
rounded stones are locally available, crushing of such rounded stones is always suggested since
the fi-actured stones embed into the surface ofa gravel road much better than rounded stones.
The percentages ofGravel, Sand and Fines (Silt and Clay) in the gradings A, B and C of
Table 2.1 are as under:

4 to 8%
When
a
single
naturally
occurring
material
does
not meet any of the
specified
gradings, 'processing' will have to be resorted to, by blending two or more materials to achieve
the required grading.
The procedures for determining the appropriate proportioning of different materials for
achieving the prescribed grading and also to meet the requirement of Plasticity Index (PI)
have been given in Appendix-A.
2.2.2.2. Where gravel meeting the requirements
in respect of grading
as per the
preceding para 2.2.2.1
is not available within economic leads or cannot be economically
processed, 'Gravel' meeting the following *requirements for Base and Wearing Courses can be
used (including processing ifrequired):

2.2.2.3. Where gravel meeting the requirements in respect ofgrading as specified in para
2.2. 1
. and 2.2.2. is not available within economical leads or cannot be economically processed,
Soil-Aggregate mixture meeting the following requirements may be used for base and surface
courses:
Soil aggregate mixtures: Soil-aggregate mixtures may be in the form of naturally
occurring materials like soil-gravel, or soil purposely blended with suitable aggregate fractions.
The primary
criteria
for acceptability of such materials
are
plasticity
characteristics and
gradation.The material should be smoothly graded for achieving the maximum possible dry
density. Fuller's grading rule {Fuller's grading rule is given by percent passing sieve = 100
(aperture size ofthe sieve/size ofthe largest particle) '} , could be used as a guide to work out the
optimum grading in different cases. A few typical gradings are given in Table 2.3. The first three
gradings indicated in this Table are especially suited for base courses whereas the remaining two
are suitable both for base course and for surfacing.
2.2.3. Plasticity characteristics of fines
2.2.3.1. The requirements ofplasticity characteristics offines in surface/wearing courses
depend on the climatic conditions of the area. The Requirements of Liquid Limit and Plasticity
Index of fines are as under:-

2.2.3.2. For use in base courses, the PI must not exceed 10.
2.2.4. Processing unsuitable materials: It is to be borne in mind that all types ofgravels
found in a region are not all suitable for road making, even though they classify as "Gravels" as
outlined above. In fact, there are few natural deposits that have an ideal gradation without being
processed. It is possible to take two materials, either one or both of them unsuitable alone for
highway use, and combine them to produce a granular material of satisfactory gradation. If the
gradation of two available materials
is known, what combinations of these materials will
produce a suitable gradation can be readily determined as per the procedure described in
Appendix-A. For many locally available materials, an effective combination may be from
crushed stone to meet the specified gradation and plasticity requirements.
2.2.5. Location and evaluation of gravel deposits
: Broadly, the procedure for location
and evaluation ofgravel deposits involves the following steps:
(a) Initial Prospecting
(i)
Collect any available information in the form of Soil Maps, Geological Maps,
Aerial photographs and findings of the MOST Research Scheme Rl on locally
available materials in the region, local enquiries on availability of any granular
material, rock outcrops etc.
(ii)
Study any existing excavations, pits etc, and carry out a visual examination
which may warrant further investigations. Enquiries from local farmers and
residents
if they
have
encountered
any
stony
materials,
often
help
in
identification ofany suitable deposits in the area.
12



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
(iii)
Study rock formations in the
region.
For example, in case of Igneous rocks,
any weathered granite could be
a good source of gravel.
In Sedimentary
rocks, there may be a possibility of gravel deposits in the form of weathered
Sand Stone and Conglomerate. Certain Metamorphic rocks with veins of quartz
may get weathered to produce gravel. Besides, certain Limestones may lead to
the formation of calcareous aggregates like Kankar which have certain amount
of cementing action, thus showing good performance. Fig. 2.1. shows typical
quarries ofgravel.
Fig
: 2.1 Typical Gravel Quarry
(b)
Preliminary investigation
When the initial prospecting gives indication of possible gravel deposits at a particular
location, a number of test pits/borings should be made to demarcate the area of possible gravel
deposits. From a number ofsuch test pits/ borings, samples should be collected to determine the
quality and possible variations in the quality. For deep deposits, the variations in the quality with
depth should also be determined. A locality plan should be prepared to show the situation of the
deposit, also showing the boundaries of the deposit. The samples collected should be properly
packed and labelled (Fig 2.2). The needed laboratory tests on gradation, plasticity etc. should be
13

======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
carried out on the samples collected. If the preliminary test results so warrant, the representative
samples should be subjected to detailed investigation.
It should be kept in view that the
samples not meeting the requirements ofsurface or base gravel may be suitable for use in the sub-
base courses. In order to reduce the number ofsamples for detailed laboratory investigations, it is
desirable to resort to hand-feel tests in the field.

: Document on Rural Road Development in India, Vol. II, CRRI, New Delhi, 1990)
(c)
Detailed Investigations
When the results of preliminary investigations for a deposit are promising, detailed
investigations should be carried out. More test pits/borings need to be made on a grid system, the
spacing
depending on
the
variability
of the
deposit
as
determined
during
preliminary
investigations. In each test pit/boring, the depth ofoverburden and variations in quality ofgravel
with depth should be determined. If there are variations in quality with depth, the aspect of
mixing of materials from different depths must also be considered. Further testing work should
be carried out depending on the variations in the gravel quality from the specified requirement.
The detailed investigations will be useful in estimating the quantity of gravel available, the
overburden required to be removed and variations in the quality of gravel. Other aspects to be
looked into are the work required on clearance, the haul distance to the
site of work and
availability ofaccess roads for hauling the gravels to the site.

2.2.6.
Materials sampling:
It
is most important to get a truly 'representative'
sample to the Laboratory for testing. The main problem in getting a 'representative' sample of
aggregate/gravel is the problem of segregation. At the stockpile, there will be a tendency for the
bigger particles to roll down towards the base. It is, therefore necessary to collect samples close
to the top, middle and bottom of the stockpile (Fig. 2.3) taking care that a wooden board should
be shoved in before collecting the samples, to prevent further segregation. All the three samples
thus collected should be mixed together and the final sample for laboratory testing, reduced by
the process of 'Quartering'. Alternatively riffle box may be used to reduce total mixed sample to
the 'representative' sample for laboratory testing.
Fig. 2.3.
: Sampling from Flat Stockpiles
2.2.7. Methods of testing
: The standard tests commonly used to determine the
suitability of a sample of gravel as a pavement material include the following:
(i)
Particle size Distribution (18:2720 Part 4)
(ii)
Plasticity Index (18:2720 Part 5)
(iii)
CBRTest(IS:2720Partl6)
(iv)
WetAggregate Impact Value (18:2386 Part 4)
2.2.8. Handling gravel
: From the time gravel is taken fi-om the quarry, the following
should be kept in view while handling gravel:
(i)
Remove the topsoil or any vegetation fi-om the surface of material source before
beginning to process the materials.
(ii)
Since variations in the layers of gravel are common, it is a good practice to remove
the material by working a broad area ofthe face.
(iii)
To avoid the problem ofsegregation, stockpiles should be constructed in layers.
(iv)
Hauling and spreading gravel should be treated as a work zone and suitable
precautions shall be taken for safety ofworkers and road users.
(v)
After gravel
is dropped on the road, the grader operator should place
it in a
windrow.
(vi)
For a new road, prior to laying gravel on a soil subgrade, the subgrade should be
properly compacted and finished to the required profile.
2.2.9. Components of soil-aggregate mixtures/gravels
Various constituents of Soil-Aggregate Mixtures forming gravels and their contribution
to the strength ofthe matrix are as under
(i)

Soil-aggregate and water interaction: Ideally, the rate of upward suction of
water from ground water below should balance the rate of evaporation from the road surface. A
typical cross-section of a Gravel Road is shown in Fig 2.4. The water interaction in the various
layers ofa gravel road can be described as under.

2.2.11. Treatment with lime/cement: Under certain conditions,
it is advantageous to
improve the properties of soils and aggregates by adopting soil stabilisation techniques with
small quantities of quick/slaked lime or Portland Cement. Clay soils are improved by mixing
with lime, resulting in increased strength/CBR, reduced swelling and shrinkage characteristics,
reduced water content in natural soil, better workability and improved draining properties.
Addition of a small amount of cement imparts cohesion between particles of gravels and
sands. Cement can be effectively used to upgrade poor quality gravels and sands.

======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
Gravel Roads
is the same as given
in IRC:SP:72 'Guidelines
for the Design of Flexible
Pavements for Low Volume Rural Roads' except that gravel/ aggregate-surfaced roads are
provided only for very low volumes of traffic. As per this method, the design parameters include
(i) Traffic in terms of the number of standard axles (80 kN) to be carried over the design life and
(ii) Subgrade strength in terms ofCBR. These parameters are discussed in paras 2.3.3 and2.3.4.
2.3.2.
Design criteria: The thickness of gravel/aggregate-surface roads shall be based
on the following criteria:
(i)
the
serviceability
loss over the design
life
is limited to
2.0, taking the
initial
serviceability index to be 4.0 just before opening the road to traffic, and the terminal

(ii) the allowable depth ofrutting under 3 m straight edge shall not exceed 50 mm.

Computation of design traffic
2.3.3.1. Seasonal variations in traffic: Most ofthe rural roads being essentially farm-to-
market roads, there are
significant variations
in
traffic volumes as observed during non-
harvesting and harvesting seasons. The seasonal variations are shown in Fig. 2.5, typically for 2
harvesting seasons of equal duration during a year. The Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT),
duly accounting for seasonal variations can be determined by the simple formula given below:-
365
Where,
T
= Number ofvehicles per day, including both motorized and non-motorized,
but excluding all two-wheelers, during the lean non-harvesting season.
t
= Duration ofa harvesting season in days
n
= Number of times by which the number of vehicles per day 'increase at the
peak harvesting season, over and above the lean season traffic T.
The values of T and n in the above formula are often readily available from local
authorities.
The use ofthe above formula is illustrated by the following example
Example
:
(i)
Lean season traffic (T) = 50 vehicles per day
(ii) Duration ofa harvesting season (t) = 40 days
(iii) Traffic at the peak harvesting season increases by 5 times (i.e, n=5) to
250 vehicles per day over and above the lean season
traffic of 50
vehicles per day,
i.e. a total of 300 vehicles ply per day at the peak
harvesting season.

: Seasonal Variations in Traffic on Rural Roads
2.3.3.2. For upgradation of existing roads: For the upgradation of an existing rural
road, ideally, the traffic census should be conducted over a period of atleast 3 days, both during
the peak harvesting season and also during the lean season. However, ifthe values of
t and n can
be obtained from local authorities with reasonable reliability, traffic census during the lean
season only will suffice; for lean season traffic, local enquiries can also help.
2.3.3.3. For new roads: In case of a new road, an approximate estimate should be made
of traffic that would ply on the road, considering the number of villages and their population
served along the road alignment and other socio-economic parameters. Traffic counts can be
carried out on an existing road in the vicinity with similar conditions and knowing the population
served as well as agricultural produce to be transported, the expected traffic on the new proposed
road should be estimated. Due consideration should be given to the 'Diverted' and 'Generated'
traffic anticipated as a consequence ofthe development ofthe proposed road, land use ofthe area
served, the probable growth oftraffic and the design life.
2.3.3.4.Traffic parameters
for
gravel
base
thickness
design:
For purposes
of
pavement design, only commercial vehicles with a gross laden weight of 3 tonnes or more along
with their axle loading are considered. These include the following:
•
Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) comprising heavy trucks and
full sized
buses.
•
Medium-Heavy
Commercial
Vehicles
(MCV)
comprising
medium-heavy
trucks, mini buses, tractor-trailers, pick-up vans etc.

The design traffic is computed in terms ofcumulative number of standard axles of 80 kN
to be carried during the design life ofthe road, using the following formula:

The parameters F, r and n are discussed in the following paras.
2.3.3.5. Vehicle damage factor: The Vehicle Damage Factor (F) is defined as the
"Equivalent number of standard axles per commercial vehicle". While the factor 'F' is arrived at
from actual axle load surveys on the existing roads, the project size and traffic volume in the case
ofrural roads may not warrant conducting an axle load survey. Therefore, indicative F values for
HCV and MCV shall be taken as 2.5 and 0.33 respectively when fiilly laden and 0.3 and 0.02
respectively when unladen.
In many
situations information regarding laden and unladen
commercial vehicles may not the available. The following VDF values shall be used for design
purposes, where actual data is not available:
Vehicle Type

HCV
2.0
MCV

2.3.3.6. Traffic growth rate: The traffic growth rate depends upon the potential of an
area for generating traffic. In the absence ofany reliable information on this aspect, a 6% growth
rate
(r) shall be taken for design purposes. The same annual growth rate of traffic shall be
considered from the year when actual field traffic surveys were carried out to the year ofopening
the road to traffic.
2.3.3.7. Design life: Normally, the gravel base thickness requirement shall be worked out
for a design life (n), of 10 years. However, depending on factors, such as the limited availability
offunds, a lower design life, not less than 5 years, shall be adopted.
2.3.3.8. Estimating design traffic parameters: In the absence of adequate data in
respect of commercial vehicles and proportions of HCV and MCV, a reasonable estimate of
design traffic in terms of cumulative standard axles during the design life of a gravel road shall
be obtained as under:

Subgrade strength
2.3.4.1. Design for new roads
2.3.4.1.1. Subgrade CBR value
For the pavement design of new roads, the subgrade strength needs to be evaluated in
terms ofCBR value.
The CBR
tests
should be conducted on
representative samples of subgrade
soil
compacted by static compaction to 100% Standard Proctor dry density and tested at a moisture
content corresponding to the wettest moisture condition likely to occur in the subgrade during its
service life. An average of test values obtained from a set of 3 specimens should be reported.
If
high variations are observed in the test values from the set of 3 specimens, then an average oftest
values obtained from 6 specimens should be taken.
2.3.4.1.2. Selection ofmoisture content for subgrade strength evaluation
The subgrade moisture conditions can be classified as under:-
Subgrade Classification
Estimate Subgrade Moisture Content
I. Where the GWT
is
close enough
to the
ground surface
to influence the subgrade
moisture content. In non-plastic soils, GWT
will
influence
the
subgrade
moisture
content, if it rises to within Im of the road
surface; in clays of low plasticity (PI<20), if
GWT rises within 3 m of the road surface
and in heavy clays (PI<40),
if GWT rises
within 7 m ofthe road surface. This category
also includes coastal areas and flood plains
where the GWT is maintained by the sea, by
a lake or by a river, besides areas where
GWT is maintained by rainfall.
1
.
The most direct method is to measure the
moisture
content
in
subgrades
below
existing pavements in similar situations at
the time of the year when the GWT is at its
highest level.
2.
The
subgrade
moisture
content
for
different soil types can be
estimated by
using the ratio
Subgrade Moisture Content
Plastic Limit
which is about the same when GWT and
climatic conditions are similar.
3.
Where
such
measurements
are
not
possible,
the subgrade
strength may be
determined
in
terms
of 4-day
soaked
CBR value.

II.
Subgrades with deep GWT but where
seasonal
rainfall
brings
about
significant
changes
in
moisture
conditions under the road.
The
subgrade
moisture
condition
will
depend on the balance between the water
entering the subgrade through pavement
edges/shoulders
during
rains
and
the
moisture leaving the ground during dry
periods. The design moisture content can
be taken as optimum moisture content
obtained from Proctor Compaction Test
IS:2720
(Part
7)
corresponding
to
maximum dry density.
The Possibility oflocal perched GWT
and effects of seasonal flooding should,
however,
also
be
considered
while
deciding on GWT
depth. Where such
situations are encountered, the subgrade
strength may be determined in terms of
4-day soaked CBR value.
2.3.4.1.3. The Soaked CBR value ofthe subgrade can be determined by conducting CBR
tests on 4-day soaked samples in the laboratory. Where adequate testing facility is not available,
typical presumptive values given in Table 2.4 can be adopted. Alternatively, soaked CBR value
can be estimated using the Nomograph given in IRC : SP :72

2.3.4.2. Upgradation/rehabilitation of existing roads: The insitu subgrade strength of
an existing road will be determined in terms ofCBR value obtained on representative subgrade
soil samples remoulded to the insitu density at the field equilibrium moisture content, observed
after the recession of the rainy season. If, for some reason, it is not found possible to determine
the field moisture content immediately after the recession ofmonsoon, the 4 days' soaked CBR
value of the remoulded subgrade soil samples, compacted at field moisture content to field
density, may be determined.
2.3.4.3. Subgrade strength classes
: In order to use the Design Chart (Para 2.3.5), the
subgrade strength is divided into the following classes:

* Where the CBR of subgrade soil is less than 2, the economic feasibility of replacing
300 mm subgrade with suitable soil needs to be explored and, if found feasible, the
pavement should then be designed based on the CBR value of the improved subgrade.
Alternatively, a capping layer ofthickness not less than 100 mm ofmodified soil (with
CBR not less than 1 0) should be provided.

to convert a portion of the Aggregate Base Layer thickness to an equivalent thickness of subbase
(MORD Specifications Clause 401) with an intermediate CBR value between the base and
subgrade is shown in Fig. 2.7.
It must, however, be ensured that a minimum 1 00 mm thickness of
gravel base
is always provided. Besides grading requirements specified for gravel base and
surfacing, the minimum soaked CBR of 80 for the gravel base material is often considered an
additional requirement. It must be kept in view that if the gravel base material does not meet any
of the two requirements (viz grading and soaked CBR value), it may not be able to withstand the
design cumulative ESAL applications over the design life, consequently requiring regravelling
earlier than designed.
It may also be pointed out here that for the recommended designs to
perform satisfactorily over the design life,
it is implied that all the needed routine and periodic
maintenance inputs will be provided.
2.3.6.
Surface gravel: The thicknesses provided in the Design Catalogue (Fig. 2.6) are
the Gravel base thicknesses and the base gravel conforms to the requirements given in para 2.2.
Base Gravel may not form a durable crust to keep the material bound together on a Gravel Road

with the surface gravel material conforming to para 2.2. The thickness of the surface layer will

a running course comprising a thin loose layer ofapprox.
1 3 mm size gravel or crushed aggregate
has been provided over the surface course, acting as a cushion between the wheel load and the

2.4. Drainage Design
§
2.4.1. Principles of good drainage: Since water is, beyond doubt, one of the critical
factors causing failure ofroads, the designer should aim at keeping the water away from the road-
bed. This can be achieved by following some simple principles of drainage design. They are
outlined below:
(i)
The surface nin-off over the pavement surface and the shoulders should be drained
away as quickly as possible, preventing the water from finding entry into the
pavement layers from the top and into the subgrade from the top and sides
(ii)
Precipitation over the open land adj oining the highway should be led away from the
road through natural drainage channels or artificial drains. Suitable cross-drainage
channels should be provided to lead the water across the road embankment which
may be cutting across to the natural drainage courses.
(iii) Consideration should be given to deal with the precipitation on the embankment
and cut slopes such that erosion is not caused.
(iv) Seepage and sub-surface water is detrimental to the stability of cut slopes and
bearing capacity of subgrades. An effective system of sub-surface drainage is a
guarantee against such failures.
(v)
Landslide-prone zones deserve special investigations for improving drainage.
(vi) Poor embankment soils can perform satisfactorily if drainage is considered in the
design.
(vii) Water logged and flood-prone zones demand detailed consideration for improving
the overall drainage pattern ofthe area through which the road is aligned.
2.4.2. Longitudinal gradient: Despite the provision of adequate cross-slopes, slight
longitudinal drainage is necessary. A minimum 0.3% longitudinal gradient is to be
ensured.
2.43.
Cross
slope/camber: As
specified
in para
2.1.3,
the
crossfall/camber over
the
carriageway for gravel roads should be 3.5% for low rainfall areas and 4.0% for high rainfal areas.
2.4.4.
Shoulder drainage
: For an efficient and quick drainage of rain water from the
roadway, it is necessary to ensure that the shoulder surface is properly sloped and is free from any
depressions or irregularities in the surface, where rainwater could get trapped.
On earthen shoulders, the
crossfall should be Wo more than the camber for carriageway
(refer para 2. 1.4).
2.4.5.
Roadside drains
2.4.5.1. Computation of run-off : All the rainfall which falls on the catchment area does
not reach the point where the drainage facility is being designed. This is due to percolation and
evaporation losses, which are governed by factors such as soil type, vegetative cover, steepness
of slope of the catchment, length of travel, temperature, land-use etc. The following formula.
25

2.4.5.2. Design of cross-section of roadside drains: When natural channels
for
discharging the run-off are not available, it becomes necessary to design and construct artificial
channels. Examples ofsuch channels are:
( 1 )
Side drains in cut-sections
(2)
Catchwater drains or Interceptor drains
(3)
Longitudinal drains along the edge of embankment to lead run-off water to
natural channels/roadside drains /ditches
The three main types of cross-sections for roadside drains/ditches are shown in Fig. 2.8.
Of the three shapes, the parabolic section is hydraulically the best and least subject to erosion,
even though not as easy in construction as the triangular and trapezoidal shapes. The triangular
section, although easy to construct is very much susceptible to erosion and gets easily blocked
with debris. The most commonly used cross-section is the trapezoidal section as it is acceptable
fi-om both considerations-hydraulic as well as ease ofconstruction. The side slopes should not be
steeper than 2:1, firom the view point of ease in grassing. The bottom width should normally be
not less than 0.3 m.

IRC:SP:77-2008
For gravel roads, a return period of one year is to be adopted in estimation of run-off For
design purposes, the storm duration should be chosen equal to the 'time of concentration'
based on
the
assumption
that maximum
discharge
at any
point
in
a
drainage
system
occurs when the entire catchment is contributing to the flow. The 'time ofconcentration' far from
any watershed is 'the time required for a given drop of water from the most remote part of the
watershed to reach the point of exit' and comprises oftwo components (i) entry time and (ii) time
of flow (see Fig. 2.9). If the drainage point under consideration is
at the entry of the drainage
system, then entry time is the time of concentration. If, however, the drainage point is situated
elsewhere, then time of concentration is the sum of the entry time and the time required to
traverse the length of the point under study. Fig. 2.10 gives a graph for estimating time of
concentration for catchement for different lengths, character and slope.
It is to be recognized that shorter the duration of critical rainfall, the greater would be the
expected average
intensity during
that period. For example, during a 60 minute
rainfall,
some
10 minute period
will have an average
rainfall
intensity
far
greater than
for the
whole storm.
For very reliable estimation of critical intensity of rainfall, it would be ideal to have the
rain gauge
records
available
at
short
intervals
say
5,
10,
20,
30,
40,
50,
60
minutes.
Alternatively, the following equation can be used.
F(T+1)
1
~
T(t+1)
Where,
I
=
intensity ofrainfall within a shorter period of t hours within a storm
F
=
total rainfall in a storm in cm falling in duration ofstorm of T hours
t
=
smaller time interval in hours within a storm duration of T hours
The one-hour rainfall maps of India for return periods of
2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 years are
available.
For built-up areas, an entry time (or inlet time) of 5 to
1 0 minutes is normally used, but in
the case of grassy plots it may take 10 to 20 minutes for water to flow over a distance of 30 m.
This factor decreases in importance as the length of drain increases and entry time (or inlet time)
becomes a small proportion of the time of concentration. For a quick estimation of time of
concentration. Fig. 2.10 can be used.
The hydraulic design ofsuch channel is usually done on the basis ofManning's formula:
n
Where,
V
=
Velocity inm per second
R
=
Hydraulic mean depth
S
=
Bed slope
n
=
Rugosity coefficient

2.4.6.
Surface drain linings
2.4.6.1. The need: Unlined, bare earth surfaces ofroadside ditches are highly susceptible
to erosion unless the flow
is limited to a very small amount.
It
is, therefore, necessary that
roadside
ditches
are provided with
protective
lining which would avoid
serious
erosion
problems and keep them serviceable. There is a wide variety of different types of linings and the
choice of appropriate lining will depend on the site conditions. The most conmion lining which
works satisfactorily in most situations is grass.
2.4.6.2. Turfing: Grass lining is more economical than other linings to establish and with
proper maintenance, will provide adequate protection against erosion for most of the
site
situations. A key factor to the success of grass lining is that it must form a firm, dense turf. For a
rapid establishment, of a vegetal lining in ditches, the same principles must be followed as
adopted for providing a vegetal protection cover on slopes. In the rainy season and in high
rainfall areas where it may be difficult to hold seeds and mulch in the ditch, an open mesh matting
of suitable material may be used instead of straw or hay mulch. The matting is laid down after
seeding and pegged with staples. Where more than one width ofmatting is required, as is usually
the case, the adjacent stripes should be overlapped (50-75 mm) and stapled at 2 to 2.5 m intervals.
It is important to ensure that matting is, elsewhere, in contact with the soil for, ifwater gets under
the matting, the seeds and soil will wash away. The efficiency of this technique depends on
making the water flow over the net, as
it is matting which prevents erosion until vegetation is
established even when large amounts of rainwater flow over it. The roadside ditch can also be
lined with sod freshly cut, to a depth of about 20 mm fi*om a well established dense turf. Sod
strips should be placed across the ditch rather than length wise. The joints should be staggered
and strips pressed firmly against one another. After the sod is in place, it is tamped or rolled to
produce a smooth continuous surface. It should be watered for several weeks after placing, as
conditions may warrant.
2.4.6.3. Paved linings: Experience has shown that under two extreme site conditions on
very flat grades and then again on steep grades, the technique ofproviding grassing as a surface
lining does not always prove satisfactory. On very flat grades (less than 0.5 per cent), the flow
over a grass lining is too slow, giving rise to the problem of silting or occurrence of deposition
which is rather difficult to maintain, and, over steep grades, erosive velocities are reached,
which, due to the scouring action, can destroy the grass lining completely.
In these
situations,
alternative
lining of cement
concrete,
brick/rubble masonry
especially on the internal streets passing through a village may be resorted to.
A practical concrete lining is the prefabricated type. In this construction, the panels are
cast in standard forms at a convenient central plant (Fig. 2.11).
2.4.6.4. Velocity of flow: For efficient functioning of a side ditch, the flow must be fast
enough to prevent silting or deposition but at the same time the flow must not be so fast as to
cause serious damage by scouring action. Ditches with grass lining should have a slope at least
0.5% to avoid deposition and siltation. The ditch has to have a grade steeper that ofthe roadway.
The ditch, in that case, will have to be deeper as it moves down grade and will also move farther
away fi-om the central line of the road, if the side slopes are not changed. One alternative way to
overcome the problem of silting or occurrence of deposition is to provide a secondary smaller

channel ofV shape at the bottom ofthe ditch (Fig. 2.12) to concentrate low flow in a smaller area
of cross-section thereby increasing the flow velocity. This secondary channel sustained flow
over long periods makes it impossible to maintain grass lining, a halfpipe section may be placed
in the secondary channel.

2.4.7.
Step-wise procedure for design of open drains: The design of the channel is
done in the following step-by-step manner.
(1)
From
the known
soil
type,
arrive
at
the
value
of Manning's
Rugosity
coefficient, side slopes and the maximum permissible velocity.
(2)
Determine the slope from the topography.
(3)
For the given discharge, calculate the hydraulic mean depth from Manning's
Formula.
(4)
Find out the cross-sectional area from the given discharge and the maximum
permissible velocity.
(5)
From the results of steps 3 and 4, solve the simultaneous equations to obtain the
bottom width and depth.

2.4.8. Illustrative example: A longitudinal channel with a trapezoidal cross-section is to
be constructed in a cut section. The longitudinal slope
is
1
in 250. The
soil
is clay, with
Mannings's Rugosity Coefficient of 0.024. The maximum allowable velocity is 0.6 m/s. Design
the drain for a discharge of 0. 1 cum/s.

Rehabilitation of Gravel Roads
2.5.1. Rehabilitation factors: The various factors to be considered for rehabilitation
are as under :-
•
Whether an overlay/strengthening layer
is required or a non-overlay strategy
is
appropriate
•
Whether new materials are required or the existing material can be improved upon
•
Whether full reconstruction or partial reconstruction
The consideration of the above factors will depend on the analysis of field data collected
during 'Condition Surveys', 'Traffic Surveys' and 'Drainage Surveys.

2.5.2. Condition survey data and its analysis: A condition survey of each gravel road
needs to be carried out at least once a year. The condition ofeach road is evaluated as 'Pavement
Condition Index' (PCI) on a rating scale of5 to 1 as detailed below:

2.5.3.
Drainage survey for rehabilitation: The condition survey data will often throw
up indications ofdistresses which are moisture related; e.g. rutting, depressions and potholes etc.
Even if such moisture-related distresses are not evident, there can exist a potential to cause such
distresses. The provisions made for drainage in the original design must be examined in order to
determine their adequacy. The longitudinal and transverse grades, width of pavement layers,
slopes and dimensions of roadside ditches etc. need to be evaluated for their adequacy. Also, a
topographic map of the area must be studied for the surface and subsurface movement of water.
The observations on the water level in road side ditches, collection of water on the shoulders,
over the pavement and in the adjoining area are very helpful in evaluating the drainage system.
The properties of subgrade soil, gravel base and gravel surfacing must also be evaluated as part
of the drainage survey. It is only after analyzing the drainage survey data that it is possible to
attribute the types of distresses observed in the condition survey, (as also the potential for such
moisture-related distresses to develop) to deficiencies in the drainage system.
2.5.4. Alternative rehabilitation strategies:
After the collection of data fi"om the
Condition and Drainage
Surveys,
alternative
rehabilitation
strategies can be worked out
including inter alia. Reconstruction, Regravelling or Routine Maintenance.
More often than not, lack ofproper drainage ofgravel roads is the cause ofdistresses that
get manifested over gravel road surfaces. Therefore,
it becomes necessary to augment the
existing drainage system.
Simultaneously deficiencies in the properties of sub-base, base and
34



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
surfacing materials may also exist, as also structural deficiencies in the thicknesses of various
layers to withstand the traffic
loads. On the basis of data collected from the Condition Surveys
as well as Drainage Surveys, and considering the comparative costs of the various possible
alternatives, an appropriate rehabilitation strategy should be arrived at.
2.5.5. Selection of most appropriate rehabilitation strategy: As per the design criterion
for gravel roads, the performance level should not be allowed to fall below a PCI of 2.0.
If,
however, proper maintenance has been neglected, the following guidelines may be followed for
rehabilitation :-
PCI
Rehabilitation Measures

Reconstruct Immediately

Regravel Immediately;
Routine maintenance to continue

Regravel within
1 year;

Overlay thickness requirement of a Gravel Road can be worked out for upgradation/
rehabilitation as per the procedure given in Para 2.3 .4.2
3. CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL
3.1. Choice of Technology
For
rural
road
construction
and
maintenance,
it
is
advisable
to
adopt
an
intermediate type of technology, somewhere
in between the purely manual methods on the
one hand and total mechanization on the other.
Since agricultural tractors are increasingly becoming popular in the rural areas, it would
be both
suitable
and
economical
to
deploy
them
for
rural
road
works
by
suitably
scheduling
the operations between agricultural operations and road works. Figs. 3.1 and 3.2
bring out the advantages ofadopting tractor-bound technology.
The
appropriate technology recommended
for
various
task
operations
in
rural
road
development works is outlined in Table 3.1

3.3. Sequence of Construction Operations
: First and foremost in the sequence of
construction operations is the site preparation, as per specified procedure. After site preparation,
the cross drainage works (culverts, causeways etc.) and the surface drains need to be provided as
per the Drainage Plan requirements. The Earth work and Subgrade preparation are then taken up,
(discussed in para 3.4). For a sub-base course, where required to be provided, the materials to be
blended are placed in the required proportions, mixed thoroughly and spread to the desired
thickness and
shape, (para 3.5). After compacting the sub-base, the materials to be blended for
the gravel base
are placed
in the required proportions, mixed thoroughly,
spread
to
the
required loose thickness and shape and compacted to the desired density. The compacted gravel
base is finished to the desired profile (described in para 3.6). Thereafter, a gravel surface course
is laid, compacted and finished to the desired profiles.
3.4.
Earthwork and Subgrade Preparation
3.4.1.
Earthwork
3.4.1.1. The cost of earthwork generally
constitutes 40
to 60% of the
total road
construction cost.
It
is, therefore, essential that careful consideration
is given towards
site
planning and various operations involved in the execution of the earthwork for economizing the
cost of road construction. Since gravel roads are often upgraded later to black-topped flexible
pavement standards as the traffic grows,
it is both difficult and uneconomical to make up any
deficiencies in earthwork at a later stage, pointing to the need for strictly adhering to the
specifications laid down in Clause 30 1 ofMORD Specifications. The main activities involved in
earthwork operation are:
(i)
Soil survey and
laboratory
investigations
for
suitability of material and
for
determining the CMC andMDD ofembankment material compaction
(ii)
The construction ofembankment.

======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
3.4.1.2. Test pits should be dug in borrow areas from where the embankment materials
are to be obtained and representative samples tested for determining their suitability as a fill
material
as per the requirements
laid down
in Clause
301.2.3 of MORX)
Specifications.
Ordinarily borrow pits along the road should be discouraged. Where permitted by the Engineer,
the requirements laid down in Clause 30 1 .4. 1 ofMORX) Specifications must be complied with.
3.4.1.3. Prior to the construction operations, the formation for embankment construction
should be prepared as
laid down
in Clause 301.4 of MORD
Specifications. The various
construction operations should be carried out as per Clause 301.5 ofMORD Specifications. The
soil for embankment construction at the time of placement should be at proper moisture i.e.,
(+)2% ofOMC. Additional water should be added ifrequired and the soil should be turned 2 to 3
times so that the water is quite uniformly dispersed. In case the soil contains excess moisture, the
soil should be allowed to dry to bring it the optimum before compaction.
3.4.1.4. For earthwork filling, in layers, the compacted thickness of the soil layer should
not exceed
1 50 mm when static smooth wheeled rollers of 80 to 100 kN static weight are used.
When the earthwork has reached a stage when the general form of the final shape of the
embankment has been obtained, the spreading ofthe earth should be done, in straight reaches, to
a crowned shape, and to appropriately superelevated profile if the reach is on a curve. The
moisture content in the laid
soil should be the optimum moisture content subjected to the
permitted tolerance. Highly expansive soils such as black cotton soil should be compacted at the
specified moisture content. The clods should be broken to less than 75 mm size. The equipment
for compaction should ordinarily be a 80-100 kN tonne smooth-wheeled power roller. For the
control of moisture prior to compaction, a truck mounted water tanker should be used, but in the
absence ofsuch a water tanker, a tractor-towed water bowser could be used (Fig 3.3).

IRC:SP:77-2008
3.4.1.5. The tolerance
limits of variations from the specified moisture content are
normally ±2% ofOMC. Densities to be aimed at in the compaction process shall be chosen with
due regard to factors such as soil type, height of embankment, drainage conditions, position of
individual layers, and type of available compaction plant, in accordance with Clause 301 of
MORX) Specification. Each compacted layer shall be tested in the field for density, and accepted
before
operations
for
the
next
layer commence. The
field
density
in
the body
of the
embankment shall not be less than 97% of standard Proctor density and 100 percent in the top
300 mm of the embankment (Subgrade). Expansive clay (such as black cotton soil) possessing
high volumetric changes should be compacted at a moisture content, wet ofthe optimum and to a
density not exceeding 90 percent of the laboratory standard Proctor density. The overall profile
should be improved with each successive layer so that as the subgrade level is approached,
the
profile ofthe formation is as per lines and grades.
The
related
quality
control
requirements
are
detailed
in
the
Quality Assurance
handbook for Rural Roads, 2007.
3.4.2. Subgrade preparation: The top ofembankment which is to receive the hard crust is
called subgrade. The subgrade soil layer shall preferably be made from good soil available
locally. The soil shall be free from vegetative matter and rubbish. In case the reach is at grade or in
cutting and insitu soil is to be used for subgrade, the method consists in loosening the soil to 300
mm depth, bringing the moisture to proper value and compacting
it with a suitable roller to
maximum Proctor density. The compaction process should commence at the edges and progress
towards the center. When the reach is in filling, it is necessary to ensure that atleast the top 300
mm of the embankment constituting the subgrade of the pavement should be compacted to
1 00
percent Proctor density in two layers at controlled moisture. The subgrade should be finished to
the desired profile; a camber board should be used to check the cross profile (Fig. 3.4).
The
related
quality
control
requirements
are
detailed
in
the
Quality Assurance
Handbook for Rural Roads.
3.5. Sub-Base Construction
In Gravel Roads, generally a gravel base of required thickness,
as per the Design
Catalogue, Fig.2.6 in Section 2, is provided directly over the subgrade, except for the very weak
subgrade (CBR=2), where a capping layer
is provided. However, a part of the gravel base
thickness can be converted into a subbase (Fig. 2.7, Section 2) layer having a CBR value in
between the CBR values of the subgrade and the gravel base. The sub-base can be a Granular
Sub-base (GSB) as per Clause 40 1 ofMORD Specifications or Lime-treated soil sub-base, as per
Clause 403 of MORD Specifications or Cement-treated soil sub-base as per Clause 404 of
MORD Specifications, depending on the locally available materials. The salient features of
construction of the above three types of sub-base courses are outlined
in paras 3.5.1,
3.5.2 and
3.5.3 below.
3.5.1. Granular sub-base: Where the locally available materials meet the grading,
plasticity and other requirements as laid down in Clause 401 of MORD Specifications, these

materials
do
not meet
the
various
requirements
without any
processing,
the
following
mechanical stabilization techniques can be resorted to:
(a)
Stabilization of clay
with

involving
the mixing of clay with
sand
so
that
the
resulting
mixture
will
have
controlled
plasticity
(PI
<
6)
and
minimum 30% sand
content. The
clay
shall be excavated and
clods broken
by 4 to 6 passes of tractor-towed disc harrows (Fig. 3.5) to meet the specified
pulverization
requirements.
The
soil
should
be
spread
in
place
to
the
required
loose-thickness.
The
requisite
quantity
of
sand
transported
from
local sources
is then added. The required quantity of water
is added to bring
the moisture
content
to
the optimum. Depth blocks
should be used
for
the
control
of
required
layer
thickness
(Fi.g
3.6).
The
mix
should
then
be
compacted by 80 to 1 00 kN smooth-wheeled roller to 1 00% Proctor density.

(b)
Stabilization
of
soil
with
soft
aggregates
(such
as
brick
bats,
kankar
and
laterite)
is
similar
to
the mechanical
stabilisation of clay with sand
as
at
(a)
above. The
soft aggregates
to be added to the blended
soil mixture
shall be
V,
of size
less than 30 mm and have wet AIV not more than 50%. The blended
soil and aggregate should be mixed together in the ratio 7:3 by volume.
(c)
Soil-Gravel/Soil-Moorum
mixes
shall
contain
a
fair
proportion
of
all
particle
sizes together with
sufficient clay
to provide proper cohesion
as per
technical
grading
limits.
The maximum
aggregate
size
should
not
exceed
one-third
the
thickness
of
stabilized
layer. The
construction
shall
otherwise
be
carried out
in
the same manner
as
for other mechanically
stabilized
soil
construction.
Care
should be
taken
that
the
layer
is
thoroughly
compacted
and laid to proper profile.
3.5.2. Lime stabilized soil construction
The
specification
for
lime
stabilized
soil
construction
shall
apply
essentially
to
stabilization of alluvial soil, moorums, clays and black cotton soils. As mentioned earlier, the
borrow areas may be previously watered for easy excavation. The excavated soil
shall be
pulverized, so that all soil clods pass the ISS 26.5 mm sieve and more than 80% through ISS 4.75
mm sieve using tractor-towed disc harrows. In case ofblack cotton soil, the borrow areas shall be
previously watered and the clods which are generally in the size range of 1 00- 1 50 mm should be
pulverized with agricultural equipment (disc-harrows), and Rotavator (Fig. 3.7). The pulverized
soil (alluvial/moorum/ black cotton soil) shall be spread on the prepared receiving surface, and
slaked lime spread over it in the required quantity (Fig. 3.8) as per the guidelines provided in
Clause 403 ofMORD Specifications. For the safety of workers, hand gloves should be provided
while
handling
lime.
The
laid
material
shall
be
cut
and
mixed
thoroughly,
using
a
tractor-towed
Rotavator.
The
mass
shall
then
be
spread
to
the
required
loose
thickness to proper profile. The compacted thickness of a layer shall not exceed
1 50 mm if 80-
1 00 kN smooth wheeled roller is used. The laying width shall extend by 150 mm on either side,
beyond the pavement width on top. The layer
shall then be thoroughly compacted without much
delay (within 3 hours) after mixing with lime with a 80- 1 00 kN smooth-wheeled roller giving 6-8
coverages as for earthwork. The subbase layer shall be checked for compaction. All controls and
permitted tolerances shall be as given in Clause 403 ofMORD Specifications. The surface after
compaction shall be cured for 7 days by sprinkling water periodically, covering by wet gunny
bags (Fig. 3.9) soon after which subsequent pavement courses shall be laid to prevent the surface
from drying out and becoming friable. The traffic shall not ply directly over the stabilized layer
during the period of curing. The related quality control requirements are detailed in the Quality
Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads.
3.5.3. Cement stabilized soil construction
For cement stabilized soil construction, the various construction operations and the
equipment deployed are essentially the same as for lime stabilized soil construction except that
compaction should be completed within 2 hours after mixing.

C. DO'S AND DON'TS
1.
Do's
While
preparing
the
subbase/
base,
where
predominant irregularities exist, make sure that
the surface profile is corrected before spreading
the Gravel/ Soil-Aggregate Mix.
For
the
equipment
used
for
mix-in-place
construction, carry out trial runs to establish the
suitability for the work.
Look for soft patches, if any and rectify them by
removing
or
adding
fresh
material
and
compacting the same throughly.
For obtaining the needed uniformly ofmixing of
water with Gravel/Soil-Aggregate,
sufficient
passes of mechanical equipment
like
tractor-
towed
disc
harrows/
rotavators
should
be
ensured.
Adopt Tractor-Bound Technology,
using
the
local agricultural tractors.
Make sure that the earth used in the earthen
shoulders has
the
requisite properties and
is
compacted to 100% Proctor Density and that
proper cross slopes
( 1%
steeper than camber)
are provided.
3.
5.
Don'ts
Do
not
permit
any
organic
or
deleterious material.
Do
not
allow
manual
mixing,
unless
the
width
of laying
is
not
adequate for mechanical operations,
as in small-sizedjobs.
Do not allow the speed of the roller
to exceed 5 km per hour.
Do not allow sharp turns with the
compaction
equipment
because
they can cause surface roughness.
Do
not
leave
the
side
slopes
un-turfed,
otherwise
rain
cuts
would be formed.
Do
not
forget
to
provide
a
well-
designed
drainage
system,
with
properly identified outlets.
3.7. Providing Gravel Surface
Over the
finished base
course,
a
gravel
surfacing
material meeting
the
specified
requirements given in Chapter 2
is spread to the required loose thickness, compacted to the
required density and finished to the desired profile.
It is good practice to place a thin layer of about 12 mm size broken stone or gravel. This
layer is intended to act as a "Cushion" between the wheel load and the base course. It is supposed
to absorb some ofthe abrasive forces ofa passing wheel. The use ofthis thin layer is optional, but
in many cases it has been noted that ifa running course is not separately provided, it will develop
naturally on its own. In light grading, the motor grader or drag works on the running course and
thus does not cut into the base course with its water resistant crust.
If
maintained evenly spread
over the carriageway, then the rest ofthe pavement should last a long time and should not dry out
very quickly in dry weather.
In general, running course is a protection against erosion caused either by climate or
vehicle loadings.

3.8.
Sealing a Gravel Road
3.8.1. Before applying bituminous surface treatment, any existing surface gravel with a
PI exceeding 10 shall be scarified and removed and the existing surface brought to proper
transverse
profile. Any
irregularities
in the
longitudinal and transverse
direction must be
removed.
If any granular layer overlay is required, the same should be implemented.
Prior to
applying the bituminous treatment, the prepared gravel surface must be primed by spraying a
Slow Setting Bituminous Emulsion with a kinematic viscosity of250-500 Centistokes at 60''C at
the rate of 1 2- 1 5 kg per 1 0 sqm area. Surface Dressing is considered a preferred surface treatment
for low volume rural roads. The selection of the size of stone chippings should be based on the
anticipated traffic and the type of surface to be provided with the bituminous surface treatment.
The
design of surface
dressing may be done
in accordance with
the
design procedure
recommended in IRC: 11 0-2005 Standards specifications and Code of Practice for Design and
Construction of Surface Dressing.
3.9.
One-Coat and Two-Coat Surface Dressing
3.9.1.
Whether one-coat or two-coat surface dressing is to be provided on a rural
road shall be decided on the basis of anticipated traffic and climatic conditions.
3.9.2. The cover material shall consist ofcrushed stone, crushed gravel (shingle) or other
stones. It should be clean, strong, durable and of fairly cubical fragments, free from disintegrated
particles, vegetable matter, dust and adherent coatings.
3.9.3. The surface dressing work shall preferably be carried out when the atmospheric
temperature in shade is lO^C or above. The bituminous material shall not normally be applied
when the surface or the cover material
is damp, weather is rainy or during dust-storm. The
underlying course on which surface dressing
is
to be
laid
shall be prepared, shaped and
conditioned to a uniform grade. The surface should be swept clean free of caked earth and other
foreign matter with hard brushes, then with softer brushes and finally blown off with sacks or
gunny bags to remove fine dust. When the base to be treated
is gravel or stabilized soil, a
bituminous primer coat shall be applied uniformly at the specified rate. After priming the base,
the bituminous binder shall be spread at the rate determined as per IRC: 11 0-2005. Immediately
after the application of bituminous material (Fig. 3.10) the cover material shall be spread in
required quantities by suitable means so as to cover the surface completely. The surface shall be
broomed to ensure uniform spreading.
3.9.4. The entire surface shall then be rolled immediately after the application of cover
material with a suitable roller. The rolling shall begin at the edges and proceed towards center,
except on the super-elevated portions, where the rolling should proceed from the inner to the
outer edge. Additional aggregates shall be spread in whatever quantities may be required to fill
irregularities and to prevent picking up ofthe aggregate by the roller.
3.9.5. The finished surface shall be opened to traffic on the following day. Ifunder some
special circumstances, the road has to be opened to traffic immediately after rolling, speed
of
traffic shall be limited to 1 6 km per hour until the following day.
3.9.6. The quahty of materials, construction etc. for two coat surface dressing shall be
similar to one coat surface dressing. Prior to the application of second coat, the surface shall be
cleaned properly. Binder, heated to appropriate temperature, shall be sprayed, preferably with a
mechanical sprayer, at the specified rate.
3.9.7.
Immediately after the application of binder, the cover material shall be spread
by suitable means at the specified rate to cover the surface completely. The rest of the process

4. MAINTENANCE METHODS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
4.1.
General
4. 1.1.While proper maintenance of all types ofroad pavements is important, it is a matter
of crucial importance for the satisfactory performance of Gravel Roads. Even though Gravel
Roads
require more
frequent maintenance
interventions
than
black-topped
roads,
these
interventions are relatively inexpensive and simple, within the available resources and skills in
rural areas. Specially designed studies as well as experiences all over the World show that for low
volumes of traffic upto about 200 vehicles per day, the maintenance costs of gravel roads work
out to be lower than for black-topped roads, while for higher volumes oftraffic, it is the other way
round.
It is mainly the neglect of proper maintenance that is responsible for gravel roads not
gaining popularity in the vast rural areas of India with low to very low volumes of traffic. With
simple inexpensive maintenance interventions, gravel roads can be easily maintained in good
condition. The simple and labour intensive maintenance methods
also hold considerable
potential for employment generation.
4.1.2. Causes of deterioration
: A gravel road deteriorates in its level of service ability
with age, basically due to following factors:
(a)
Traffic: The traffic operating on the facility can cause different types of distress like
rutting, corrugations, loss of materials, and structural deformation. The extent of
deterioration depends upon the intensity of traffic, especially the wheel load and its
repetitions. Solid-wheeled cart traffic can be very damaging to the road, since the
solid wheels cut into the pavement causing deep ruts.
(b)
Environment: The external influence of environmental factors such as rainfall and
snowfall, can also cause deterioration of the pavement. Rainfall causes erosion of
shoulders and slopes and ingress ofwater into the pavement structure and subgrade
and affects the performance of drainage structures. Snowfall can cause ingress of
moisture into the pavement structure and subgrade and result in frost action. The
influence of the environment on a gravel road is much more severe than on black-
topped/ concrete roads.
4.1.3. Maintenance operations
(a)
The various maintenance operations on gravel roads can be broadly classified into
the following categories :-
(i)
Routine
maintenance,
comprising
patch
repairs;
dragging,
grading,
maintenance of shoulders and repairs to roadside drains, road signs, culverts
etc., and collection of data such as road condition and traffic surveys, which
are required to be carried out by the maintenance staff once or twice every
year.
(ii)
Periodic maintenance, which consists ofwork items such as 'Regravelling' to
be carried out periodically every few years.
(iii)
Special repairs, and flood and rain damage repairs, which consist of repairs
to the embankment, pavement, culverts,
road furniture, etc. necessitated by
56



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
landslides,
earthquakes,
cyclones,
heavy
rains/cloud
bursts,
floods
etc;
the
nature and extent of such repair works could not be foreseen
or predicted.
(b)
Before
starting
with
the
work,
it
should
be
ensured
that
adequate
arrangements (like erection of barriers, signs and red flags/light/reflectors) (Fig.
4.1) are made for the safety of traffic, workmen, pedestrians, cattle etc. The work
should be planned in such a way that inconvenience caused to the traffic is minimal.
Wherever possible, the work should be confined to half the pavement width at a
time, leaving the other halfto traffic.
4.1.4. Economic benefits of maintenance operations
Timely and proper maintenance of Gravel Roads can lead to significant economic
benefits. These include:
(i)
Reduction in level of future maintenance and rehabilitation costs.
(ii)
Improved safety and reduction in road closures.
(iii) Reduction in vehicle operating costs and accident costs.
4.2.
Surface & Structural Defects on Gravel Roads
4.2.1.
The defects observed on Gravel Roads are essentially the result of complex
interactions
between
the
materials
used,
traffic
type
and volume,
climatic
conditions,
construction methods and quality control
exercised.
Broadly,
the various
defects can be
classified as:-
(a)
Surface
defects, observed
in
the upper
layers
of the pavement
are due
to
factors
like
poor
compaction,
unsatisfactory
grading,
climatic
conditions,
poor
quality
of
materials,
inadequate
drainage,
neglect
of
routine
and
preventive maintenance measures
etc.
or a combination of these. The surface
defects result in poor riding quality. The more common surface defects are:
-
Corrugations
-
Potholes
-
Rutting
-
Ravelling/Loose Material
-
Surface Erosion/Dust Generation/Loss of Surface Material
-
Slippery Surface
-
Soft Spots
(b)
Structural Defects, are deep seated problems caused by overstressing of the
subgrade and/or the pavement. One ofthe common causes is lack of drainage, other
causes being substandard materials used and inadequate thickness of the pavement
for the design traffic. These defects are often characterized by shear failure in form
oflarge settlements and upheavals.

4.2.2. Surface defects can be removed by grading or planing the surface. However, gravel
roads with structural defects would require a more detailed investigation and treatment including
rehabilitation.
4.2.3.
During the Condition Survey of any Gravel Road,
it is necessary to make an
assessment of the severity of surface defects in terms of the severity being 'High', 'Mediun' or
'Low'. Such an assessment can be accomplished as under:
(a) Surface Roughness/Riding Quality (Refer para 2.5.2
Section 2)
An assessment shall be made in terms ofthe 'Pavement Condition Index' (PCI) on a rating
scale of5 to 1 as under:
Normal Safe Driving Speed (km/h)
Over 35
25-35
15-25

(f)
Surface Erosion
Gravel roads are susceptible to longitudinal/transverse erosion by flow ofwater over the
road surface. An assessment of the severity level can be made by the bumpiness experienced
while driving in a car orjeep over the eroded surface, as under:
(i)
Bumps can be felt and heard and significant
reduction in speed is required
High severity

Dust Generation
An assessment of the dust nuisance shall be made by driving in a car/jeep at a speed
of 30-40 km/h and taking observations as under:
Dangerous loss of visibility - significant discomfort
High severity
Some loss of visibility - no discomfort
Medium severity
No loss of visibility
Low severity
4.3. Maintenance of Gravel Roads
The maintenance methods commonly adopted for Gravel Roads are Grading, Dragging
Patching, RegraveUing and use ofDust Palliatives, described in sub-paras 4. 3.1 to 4.3.5.
4.3.1.
Grading
4.3.1.1. It is a matter of vital importance that a good camber is always maintained on a
gravel road surface to enable the water to shed off readily. Such a maintenance effort can be
accomplished by regular 'Grading'. For Gravel Roads, the 'Grading' is also needed to restore
gravel from the shoulders which has been lost from the Gravel Road surface and the gravel thus
restored can be used to fill potholes and corrugations etc. Grading can be used to correct the
following defects:
-
Loss of Shape
-
Ruts
-
Potholes
-
Corrugations

-
Silted or Blocked Ditches
4.3.1.2. Grading is a 'Routine Maintenance' activity and can be carried out by tractor-
towed graders. The gravel road surface to be graded should first be prepared by patching of large
potholes or depressions and draining out areas of standing water etc.
It may be necessary to
scarify the existing surface to cut to the bottom of any surface defects and loosen the material for
reshaping. The process of grading can be carried out by tractor-towed grader (Fig. 4. 2). Grading
can be ofthree types, as under:
•
Light Grading
: When the gravel surface crust is not broken and it is a matter of
only spreading or raking back loose surface material to provide a "running course"
as protection ofthe surface crust. A light Grader or Drag can serve the purpose.
•
Normal Grading
: This is done when the surface crust is cut and it is necessary to
remove surface defects such as corrugations, ruts or potholes. In this case a 8-10
tonne Grader is suitable.
•
Heavy Grading
: This is required when the road is out of shape and in the process
of repair, and fairly heavy scarifying is required. This reshaping operation requires
a Grader in the 10-12 tonne mass range.
4.3.1.3. The Grader works on one side ofthe road at a time and works in passes about 200
metres long to convenient and safe turning points (Ref.
1 ). Light Grading will normally require 4
passes to reshape the road (Fig. 4.3). Heavy Grading will require additional passes to achieve the
required camber. Work should be completed on one side of the road at a time. An even number of
passes should be used to avoid a flat finished crown. The initial passes cut to the bottom of the
surface irregularity and deposit a windrow just beyond the centre line. If required, water should
be sprayed over the windrow. In order to avoid flattening the centre, the final pass should not be
made down the centre ofthe road with the grader blade horizontal (Fig. 4.4).
4.3.1.4. On sections where grading has been completed, the road roller should follow.
Normally about 8 passes of the roller are required to achieve full compaction, working towards
the centre. Shoulders should be treated as part ofthe running surface. Camber should be checked
with a Camber Board at about 1 00 m intervals. On bends, the surface should be straight at 4 to 6 %
from shoulder to shoulder. The shape ofthe road over the culverts should be maintained to avoid a
hump (Fig. 4.5). Where required, material should be brought from either side of the culvert to
maintain the required cover to the top ofthe culvert.
4.3.1.5. The number of times during the year each Gravel Road will need grading will
depend upon the amount of traffic
using the road,
climatic conditions
in the
area,
local
topography and other physical features. In the absence of adequate experience in the area, the
Grading Frequency Chart developed by the TRRL ofUK (Fig. 4.6) may be used.

4.3.2.
Dragging
4.3.2.1. Dragging is normally a Routine Maintenance task used to improve the gravel
road surface. Regular Dragging smoothens out minor defects in the road surface and removes
loose material from the surface. Where a running course of sand/gravel is used to cover the base
material for protection from traffic wear, frequent dragging is used to redistribute the running
course material disturbed by traffic plying over the surface.
4.3.2.2. Specially made drags towed by agricultural tractors can be used for Dragging.
Where the traffic plying on a rural road is of a low order, frequent dragging can reduce the need
for Grading.
It
is generally after a number of dragging operations that Grading
is required.
Dragging will not remove corrugations once they are formed, nor will it restore camber or lost
material.
4.3.2.3. Dragging may be considered suitable only when development of road has been
carried out to a level when the pavement is structurally sound and where the loose running course
is less than 25 to 30 mm in depth.
4.3.2.4. For various road conditions, the recommended plants are given below:
Road Condition
Recommended Plant
Roads with depths of loose material in
excess of 20 mm
Broom drag
Cutting drag using old grader blades.
Towed grader or light power grader.
Roads with roughness levels* less than
6000 mm/km with no appreciable loose
material
Timber framed drag or broom drag
Light grader or planer
Roads with roughness levels greater than
6000 mm/km
Cutting drag using old grader blades.
Light grader, planer or medium
grader
* Roughness measured using Bump Integrator
Drags should not be towed at speeds above 1 0 km/h and preferably should be towed at 5km/h. A
broom drag and roller can be seen in Fig. 4.7, while a typical tractor and timber drag are shown in
Fig. 4.8. In Fig. 4.9, it can be seen how a drag can be used to shift material from different parts of
the pavement.
4.3.2.5.
It must be emphasised that Drags must be used at frequent enough intervals to
smoothen the road surface. Drags should not be used on roads which have deteriorated, due to
lack of frequent maintenance interventions, to a level where only heavy grading or reshaping is
the answer. Fig. 4.10 shows a multi-purpose tractor-towed equipment enabling an operator to
carry out a wide range ofmaintenance activities.

4.3.3.
Patching
4.3.3.1. Where potholes or depressions on the gravel road are large, patching is required
before grading. Sometimes, patching
is required between grading or reshaping operations.
Patching can be used to repair eroded areas or can be used to restore areas which become soft
when wet. When the work involves material less than a truck or two, the repair work is termed
patching, while for large scale work,
it is termed Spot Gravelling or Regravelling. Patching
cannot be used for repairing Corrugations but can be used to correct:
-
Erosion Gullies
Where the potholes are large in numbers, scarifying will be needed with a grader and
possibly Regravelling.

4.3.3.2. Gravel to be used for patching should be dumped by the road side where it is
required to be used. The quaHty of gravel should be at least as good as the gravel already used in
the road surfacing. The gravel should be dumped on the shoulder (Fig. 4.11) adjacent to the
location where the patching work is to be carried out. Care must be taken to see that the material
should not be dumped on the road surface.
4.3.3.3. In the pothole or rut, where patching work is to be carried out, any loose material
or standing water should be brushed out (Fig. 4.11). Where the potholes are large in size or are
very deep, the sides should be cut back to be vertical.

Roads, PIARC, Published by the TRRL, UK)
4.3.3.4. Check the moisture content of the material. If it is dry, the area to be patched
should be sprinkled with water and also water should be added to the material to be used for
patching. The area should be filled with gravel to a depth ofabout 100 mm. Ifthe material is dry,
it should be sprinkled with water to assist compaction.
4.3.3.5. The 1 00 mm layer at a water content close to OMC, should be compacted using a
roller or a hand rammer. In this manner, patching is built up in layers. The patched area is thus
filled up with gravel to about 30 mm proud of the surface level and is spread and raked to the
correct shape. The patch is compacted by a roller if the area is large and by hand rammer if the
area is small. Even for large areas, hand rammers will be required for the short edges and comers.
4.3.4.
Regravelling
4.3.4.1. Regravelling is a periodic maintenance operation. Well before any significant
reduction in base thickness takes place and before the PCI rating reduces to the terminal PCI of
2.0, the task of 'Regravelling' must be accomplished. Regravelling can be carried out to correct
the following defects :-
-
Loss ofshape
Ruts
-
Potholes
-
Erosion Gullies
Grading or Reshaping should be carried out before the regravelling operation.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
4.3.4.2. Gravel obtained from a quarry or gravel pit must meet the specified quality
requirements and the needed approval obtained before commencement ofthe work. The sections
where Regravelling is required should be marked at the site. The existing road surface must be
graded to provide a firm regular surface and the edges should be boxed to provide lateral support
for the fresh gravel. The graded surface should be watered to have the water content close to
OMC and roller compacted. The camber should be checked with a Camber Board and it should
fall within the specified range.
4.3.4.3. The Drainage System should be checked and repaired where necessary. The
excavated gravel should be stockpiled in low heaps to prevent segregation. After the initial
grading of the road is complete, the gravel should be transported to the regravelling site. The
dumping of gravel should start at the far end ofthe site so that the gravel heaps do not come in the
way oftrucks delivering later loads.
Materials should be dumped at correct spacing on one side ofthe road only.
A Weekly Gravelling Plan should be prepared to indicate hauling distance etc.
4.3.4.4. Spreading ofthe gravel can start when there is a working length of at least 200 m
of dumped material. Initially the road is sprayed with water. The Regravelling material is then
spread across the road using the grader. The material is then alternately spread by the grader and
watered until its moisture content is close to OMC. The material is then graded to produce the
specified camber. The camber should be checked with the Camber Board at approx. 100 m
intervals along the road. If the desired camber is not achieved, the process of grading should be
repeated.
After the correct camber has been achieved, rolling can start, commencing at the edge
towards the centre. The roller should progress section to section at the same rate as the Grader.
About 8 passes are generally required to achieve full compaction.
4.3.5. Use ofdust palliatives
4.3.5.1. The main disadvantage being cited against gravel roads, is the dust generation,
considered as a safety hazard and pollutant to the environment. Besides being a safety hazard, a
very significant implication of dust generation is the loss of fines from the surface gravel which
leads to increased gravel loss and consequently more frequent maintenance.
If, however, the
generation of dust can be controlled, the expenditure on gravel road maintenance can be
significantly reduced.
4.3.5.2. There is a wide variety of dust palliatives available which can be divided into 7
basic categories, as under:
(a)
Water
(b)
Water absorbing products (hygroscopic)
-
Calcium Chloride brine and flakes
-
Magnesium Chloride brine
-
Sodium Chloride (Salt)

4.3.5.3. The selection of type has to be based on the quantity of fines in the surface
material,
climatic
conditions and
traffic volume. The
following
four
categories of dust
palliatives appear suitable for Indian conditions:
(I)
Water
(ii)
Water absorbing products (hygroscopic)
(iii) Organic petroleum products
(iv)
Clay additives
4.3.5.4. Prior to applying dust palliatives, all the surface defects should be removed,
gravel added to provide the correct shape/camber/superelevation and the surface compacted.
The surface should be dampened (except when non-emulsified petroleum products are used).
The dust palliative should then be applied uniformly over the surface. After light compaction.

traffic may be allowed ifchlorides are used while for other products, some time may be required
for the product to get absorbed before allowing traffic. Field trial sections need to be laid and
their performance monitored to evaluate the efficacy ofa product.
4.4. Maintenance ofShoulders, Drainage and Structures
4.4.1. Inspection of drainage system, shoulders etc. in both dry and rainy seasons
is
necessary for effective identification of various defects. In the dry season, structural damages
can be better identified and in the rainy season, actual functioning ofthe drainage system can be
evaluated. Any field supervisor must evaluate the extent of damage in order to quantify the
needed maintenance measures; such an evaluation can best be done by inspection on foot. The
supervisory staffshould look for:
(i)
Ditch cross-section destroyed
(ii)
Ponding in the ditch and shoulders
(iii) Silting
(iv) Uneven ditch invert, varying x-section
(v)
Invert and sides ofditch eroded

4.4.3. Activities
(i)
Reshaping/Regrading/Deepening
of
Ditches/Drains:
These
can
be
done
manually. Alignment should be
set by string line and the materials within the
string line should be cut and removed. Cross section, grading and depth should
be checked and
corrected. Wherever possible, motor grader can be used
for
these activities. The excess material must be removed from site and in no case
should be spread on the road surface.
(ii)
Clearing and
cleaning
of Ditches/Drains: Any
object which
can
interfere
with water flow should be removed. These objects should be disposed of well
away from the road so that these cannot impede the water flow again.
(iii) Repair of Drain Erosion: This should be done by replacing and back filling the
lost
soil.
Permanent measures
like masonry
lining
or
precast
drain
can be
considered.
(iv) Repair of Drain
lining:
Settled or damaged precast
sections or loose
stone
should be removed and
underlying
soil
compacted.
After
addition
of fresh
soils, the levels should be corrected and then only fresh stones or precast drain
should be laid.
(v)
Vegetation control: Except in arid areas, once a year, grass and weed cutting
and bush clearance on the shoulders
is a must. In case of earth or gravel roads
these activities may be required to be done more frequently. Tractor-towed mower
can be employed where available, but ordinary manual method should be sufficient
for the purpose. Dead or leaning trees should be removed from the roadside. Use of
chemicals or burning of the roadside vegetation should be avoided as these are
harmfiil.
4.5. Special Problems ofHill Road Maintenance
4.5.1. Some ofthe special problems ofhill road maintenance are:
(1)
Snow clearance
(2)
Slips and landslides
(3)
Drainage
Snow Clearance
The roads in the Himalayan hill region get covered with snow. Snow clearance can be
done manually or by special equipment (dozers, snow masters and snow blasts).
Landslides and Slips
Landslides and
slips
are
a common
feature of
hill
roads. Road maintenance
in
areas
subjected
to
landslides
and
slips
poses
severe
problems.
The
greatest of
them
is quick removal of debris and restoration of traffic. Mechanical equipment
like dozers becomes very necessary.
Drainage maintenance
Maintenance
of
drainage
structures
is
an
important
task
in
hill
road
maintenance.
The
quick
and
efficient
removal
of
water
prevents
slips
and
landslides
and
road
deterioration.

drains,
cross-drainage
structures,
side
drains
and
subsurface
drains
should
be
inspected before the monsoons and cleared of all obstructions.
4.6. Maintenance Management
(a)
General
The
objectives of maintenance management
are
to plan and programme
the
maintenance activities making optimal use of the resources of men, materials,
machinery and money so
that the planned works
are performed
to
a
traffic-
worthy condition. The steps to achieve these objectives are discussed below.
(b) Road Data Banks
A proper management decision could be taken only when
sufficient data are
available on the problem. Hence
it is of vital necessity to collect and compile all
relevant data about the road and
its environment and the resources available to
maintain the road network. These data should also be updated regularly.
It
is
reconmiended that the following data may be made available in the road data banks.
(i)
Road cross-section including pavement composition (type and thickness),
shoulders, height ofembankment, side slope etc.
(ii)
Geometries ofalignment
(iii)
Details of various structures along the road viz., cross drainage structures,
roadside drains, breast walls, retaining walls, kilometre stones, traffic signs,
godowns etc.
(iv)
Condition of the road-pavement surface condition (rutting, potholes
etc.)
condition ofshoulder, and side drains.
(v)
The maintenance history of the road - the date and type of maintenance put in
and its subsequent performance.
(vi)
Traffic volumes and the quarterly rate and type ofaccidents.
Some of the road features are of a permanent nature like geometric design
features, cross-sectional details etc. and require to be updated only when there
is a major reconstruction. However, the road condition surveys (in terms of
PCI) and traffic counts etc. need to be updated at reasonable frequency. Each
State should possess a suitable machinery to collect, analyse and compile such
data which can be of immense use in maintenance management. A system of
road registers for each road can also be introduced.
(c)
Standards of Maintenance
The next step in maintenance management will be to evolve reference standards
to help the maintenance staff to take the right decisions. In a systems concept,
there are three distinct types ofreference standards:
(i)
Performance standards which define the level of quality below which the
various components of the road should not fall, so that the road users are given
a satisfactory level of service from the technical and economic points of view.
These
standards
are
the
basis
for determining when and what
type of
75



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 102
======================================================================
IRC:SP:77-2008
maintenance activities are to be provided to the road network. Rutting,
potholing etc. are the parameters used to assess the performance level;
(ii)
Quantity standards, which indicate the resources required
to achieve the
necessary level of service; and
(iii)
Operational
standards,
which
specify
the
working
method
and
crew
requirement
consistent with
a reasonable
level of productivity
for each
maintenance activity possible. These standards can be revised and improved
based on the achieved possible output in the field.
(d)
Operational Management
For proper management of the resources allocated for maintenance, the objectives
to be aimed at should be reduction in costs for a defined quality ofwork, better work
performance within the same cost and proper deployment ofmen and machinery to
ensure an optimal utilisation of the available resources. For this,
it is necessary to
identify the basic maintenance activities, quantum of work needed in relation to
road performance standards and the resources needed to fulfil these tasks in terms
of materials, machinery and man-hours. Having done this,
it would be easy to
prepare a work schedule for weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly operations. In
this way, it will be possible to move from a purely financial accounting system to a
rational process ofanalytical management.
Modernisation of maintenance management may
involve
radical changes
in
traditional
working
methods.
Mobile
system
of gangs
in
the
place
of the
time-honoured labour groups, who are practically immobile and have
little or
no equipment will go a long way in streamlining the routine maintenance work.
The maintenance personnel should also be given periodic training.

Organizational!Aspects ofMaintenance Management
It is necessary to have a suitable organisational set-up for an effective implementation of
various maintenance measures. There should be a separate maintenance unit for rural roads in
each district, to carry out the monthly maintenance work programme. Depending on the nature of
the maintenance
activities,
the work could be outsourced
to
local
people. The required

PROPORTIONING DIFFERENT MATERIALS FOR ACHIEVING THE
PRESCRIBED GRADING
A-1.
Combining two materials
When only two materials are to be combined, a simple graphical method
described below can be followed:
Steps:
It is required to blend sand (A) and silt-clay (B) to obtain the following gradation:
Sieve designation
Percentage passing

(i)
On a convenient size of rectangular graph, scale off top linearly from 100 to 0
as percentage of A in mix. Scale off the base corresponding from 0 to 100 as
percentage of B in mix. Scale off the vertical ordinate from 100 at top to 0 at
bottom on the left and 0 at top to 100 at bottom on the right, representing the
percentages passing sieve [Fig A-1].
(ii)
On the left ordinate, mark off percentages passing the given sieves for material
A. On the
right ordinate mark off percentages passing the given
sieves
for
material B.
(iii)
For each
sieve
size,
connect by
a
straight
line
the
points,
representing the
respective percentages passing each material. The intersection of each sieve line
by any vertical line will define the combined grading of the two materials mixed
in the proportions shown in the top and bottom horizontal scales.
(iv) On each
sieve
line,
the
specified percentage
passing
limits
are marked by
small
circles.
The
intercept
lying
between
the
circles
represents,
for
any
particular sieve line, the range ofproportion that will comply the specification.
(v)
If mixtures within the
specification
limits
are possible,
vertical
lines can be
erected
such
that
their
intersection
points
with
all
sieve
lines
lie
on
the
acceptable intercepts. The highest and the lowest percentages of either material
at which this can be done represent the limiting mixtures which conform to the
specifications. The mid-point between the limiting mixtures will usually provide
the best mixture.

Combining Three Materials
In dealing with mechanical stabilisation,
it
is often found necessary to combine
different materials to obtain the
finally desired gradation.
Rothftach's graphical
method is a reasonably quick, accurate and simple method, and is used, for design
of cement concrete mixes, bituminous mixes and granular mixes. The method
consists ofthe following stages:
(i)
Using the desired aggregate gradation, a distribution curve
is plotted with the
percentage passing as linear ordinates and the sieve sizes on the horizontal scale. In
order to mark the sieve sizes on the horizontal
scale, an inclined line (OA in
Fig. A-2) is first of all drawn. By marking the known percentages passing each size
sieve on this line and dropping vertically the intersection point to the horizontal
80

axis, the location ofthe sieve size on the horizontal axis is determined.
(ii)
The particle size distributions of the given materials to be blended are plotted on
this scale. The distribution curves will not generally be straight lines (Lines OB,
CDE and CF GAin Fig. A-2).

(iii) With the aid of a transparent straight edge, straight lines are drawn representing the
particle size distribution in the best possible manner (Lines HJ and KA). This
means that the areas enclosed between the distribution curve and the straight line
should be minimum and are balanced about the line.
(iv)
The opposite ends ofthese lines arejoined together (Lines BH and JK).
(v)
The proportions for blending can be read offfrom the points where the joining lines
cross the straight line representing the mixture. These points are L and M.

The method is illustrated by the following example
Cols.
1 and 2 in the Table below give the gradation limits for various sieve sizes of a
stabilized soil mixture. Three materials are available, whose gradations are given in Cols. 4, 5
