1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Prq)aration ofhighway projects involves a chain ofactivities, such as, field surveys and
investigations, selection ofalignment, carrying out various designs, preparation ofdrawings and estimates,
etc. To be compatible with technical requirements, consistent with economy, it is essential that every
project should be prepared after thorough investigations and collecting all relevant information and evaluating
all possible altematives.
1.2.
The extent and quality ofinvestigations have a strong influence on selection ofthe most
cost-effective design, estimation of quantities cost and execution ofthejob itself As such, accuracy and
completeness of surveys deserves very special attention in project preparation. The objective can be
achieved by carrying out the project preparation work either departmentally or with the help ofconsultants.
In any case, it should be ensured that experts having the required knowledge are deployed on the work.
Use ofmodem instruments and survey techniques ensure high degree ofaccuracy and can speed up the
work. Quality Assurance Plan is required to be drawn before the start of field investigations.
1.3.
Adequate funds should be earmarked for the work of survey, investigation and project
preparation. Estimation ofrealistic fund and time requirement needed for project preparation will go a long
way in making the project preparation a success.
It will be found that in the long run, such investment pays
more than for itself in the form ofwell prepared and cost effective projects, orderly schedule ofwork and
timely completion.
1 .4.
Systematic presentation ofproject details is no less important. The project document is
the very basis oftechnical, administrative and financial sanction ofa project.
It is also crucial for accurate
execution of work in the field. The project should, therefore, be comprehensive enough for proper
appreciation ofthe proposals as well as easy understanding ofthe details. This Manual lays down guidelines
both for survey and investigations and presentations ofthe project details.
1.5.
The Indian Roads Congress first published this manual in 1977. Since then, considerable
experience has been gained by the Highways Departments and Consultants in this field, making it necessary
to revise the manual.
The work was taken up by the Project Preparation, Project Contract
and
Management Committee ofthe Indian Roads Congress. Initial revised draft ofthe manual was prepared
by Dr. L.R. Kadiyali. The Committee appointed a Sub-committee consisting of Sarvashri Devendra
Sharma as Chairman, A.K. Mukherjee, P.K. Datta, D.C. De to finalise the revised draft ofthe manual.
The Sub-committee reviewed and modified the initial draft and the revised draft ofmanual was placed
before the Committee in the meetings held on 12-1-1997, 5-1-1998 and 22-4-1998.
The Project
Preparation, Project Contract and Management Committee (H-8) (personnel given below) approved the
draft in its meeting held on 6"' July 1 998

The manual was approved by Highways Specifications and Standards Committee, Executive
Committee and Council (held at Jaipur) ofIndian Roads Congress in their meetings held on 25- 1 0- 1 998,
16-7-99 and 6-8-99 respectively.
2. 1
.
The manual deals with rural sections ofNational Highways, State Highways and Major
District Roads.
It does not deal with Other District Roads and Village Roads, for which a reference may
be made to the "IRC:SP:20 Manual on Route Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance ofRural
Roads". However, the provisions and guidelines in this manual are expected to be applicable to a large
extent to Urban Roads, Expressways and BOT projects also
. But for these roads, some additional
specific requirements may be there, than those dealt in this document. The manual deals with new constmction
as well as improvements to existing roads. Special aspects of each have been highlighted wherever
necessary. The selection ofalignment ofany road is generally not governed by the siting ofcross-drainage
structures except in case ofmajor bridges of length more than 60 m. IRC:SP:54 "Project Preparation
Manual for Bridges" lays down guidelines covering the various aspects which are to be detailed in the
preparation of a bridge project of length more than 6 m. The survey and investigation for small
cross-drainage works with length less than 6 m is covered in IRC:SP: 1 3
. For hill roads and road tunnels,
reference may also be made to IRC: 52 "Recommendations about the Alignment, Survey and Geometric
Design ofHill Roads" and IRC:SP:48 "Hill Road Manual".
2.2.
In order to ensure that the surveys and investigations. Feasibility Report and Detailed
Project Report are complete and no essential detail is missed, a checklist
for each ofthose activities is
presented in the Appendices -4,5&6.
2.3.
It should be understood clearly that the extent of operations involved in surveys and
investigations mcluding the detailing ofthe individual aspects, would depend very much on the size and
scope ofeach project and the class ofthe highway. Depending on needs ofthe situation, one or more
phases ofinvestigations might be curtailed, telescoped or made more extensive than prescribed in the
manual.
2. SCOPE

======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
2.4.
The order in which various surveys are discussed in the manual should not be taken to
mean that such work must strictly follow the same pattern or sequence. Some ofthe surveys could easily
be initiated in advance and carried out simultaneously overlapping each other. For example^ some results
ofsoil and materials survey and study ofcross-drainage structure^ would be needed as an essential input
to the Feasibility Report. But more detailed investigations pn these aspects may be continued in the
detailed engineering phase.
It should be upto the Engineer-in^harge to exercise his discretion and adopt
a flexible approach. The requirements ofthe funding agencies or the authority according administrative
approval may also result in rescheduling the sequence ofwork and in redefining the extent ofcoverage of
each work.
3. STAGES IN PROJECT PREPARATION
3.1.
Broadly, the stages involved in the preparation and sanction ofproj ect are
:
1.
Pre-feasibility study
2.
Feasibility study/preliminary project report preparation
3.
Detailed engineering and plan of construction
3.2.
hi some cases, specially for externally funded and BOT^ proj ects, it may be necessary to
prepare a pre-feasibility report to enable a funding agency or private financier to appreciate the broad
features ofthe project, the levels offmancial involvement and probable returns. This may be done on the
basis ofreconnaissance survey by collecting information on the present status ofthe road, deficiency/
distress identification, development potential, environmental impact, traffic data (present and future),
approximate estimation ofcost and an economic analysis. The economic analysis may involve traffic
allocation studies, assessment ofresource generation potential , funding pattem and risk. Location of toll
4
plaza sites may also need to be identified
.
3.3.
The Feasibility Study is intended to establish whether the proposal is acceptable in terms
ofsoundness ofengineering design and expected benefits fi^om the project for the investments involved.
The Feasibility report enables the funding agency to accord approval to the project. This approval is
commonly known as Administrative Approval (AA)
in the Highway Departments/ Public Works
Departments in the country. When international funding is involved, the Feasibility Study forms a basis for
an investment decision.
3.4.
The Detailed Engineering covers detailed alignment surveys, soil and materials surveys,
pavement design studies, drainage studies, environment management plan based on environment impact
assessment studies, detailed drawings, estimates and implementation schedules and documents. On the
basis ofsuch work. Technical Approval and Financial Sanction (TA and FS) are accorded to the project,
enabUng it to be executed.
For extemally funded and BOT projects, the requirements at various stages are different and may
ask for specific informations involving various degree ofaccuracy ofsurvey and investigations.
3.5.
The sequence ofsurvey operations and proj ect preparation may thus, have to be structured
to meet the specific needs ofthe project, its funding option and the requirements ofthe authority sponsoring it.
3.6.
Fig. 3.1. gives a flow chart ofthe operations involved in highway project preparation.
3.7.
Land Acquisition
The process of land acquisition needs to be started immediately after finalising the alignment.

Provisions ofthe appropriate Land Acquisition Act will govern the various steps to be followed in the
process ofland acquisition. Depending on the quantum ofland acquisition, creation of separate land
acquisition authority may also be sometimes necessary. Acquisition ofGovernment land. Private Land,
Forest Land and land falling under Costal Regulation Zone, etc. will attract different acts/regulations.
The various steps in land acquisition, namely, appointment ofexclusive completent authority, if
required declaring intention of acquisition, issuing notices and giving hearing to the affected parties, joint
measurements, final notices and acquisition ofthe land, etc. require considerable time and need to be
closely monitored to acquire the land within the desired time limit.
Temporary and permanent stmctures coming in the alignment, trees need to be cut, including those
in the forest lands, need special attention for obtaining permission/valuation from the Competent Authority.
Similarly, obtaining permission ofthe Ministry ofForest and Environment for the forest land and the land
coming in the coastal regulation zone need to be processed in time.
Identifications and acquisition of land for borrow areas, quarries, etc. also need to be started in
advance in case of large projects, such as, national highway project and expressway projects.
4. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF ROUTE SELECTION AND
ALIGNMENT IMPROVEMENT
4.1.
The fundamental principle ofroute selection and alignment improvement is to achieve the
least overall cost on transportation, having regard to the costs of initial construction ofthe highway facility,
its maintenance, and road user cost, while at the same time, satisfying the social and environmental
requirements. To achie ve this objective, it will be necessary to make a detailed investigation before the
location is finally decided. Factors that should be kept in view in the process are listed in Appendix-1 and
in Fig. 4. 1
.
It should be understood that all these factors may not be applicable to each and every highway
project and some ofthem, even ifapplicable, may not be feasible in many circumstances. For each case,
the Engineer-in-charge has to exercise his ownjudgement to reach an optimum compromise solution in the
light ofthe fundamental principle ofminimum transportation cost enunciated earlier.
4.2.
Where the proj ect involves improvements to an existing road, every effort should be directed
towards removing the inherent deficiencies with respect to
•
Plan and profile
e
Sight distance/visibility in horizontal as well as vertical plan
•
Carriageway, shoulder and roadway width
•
Cross-drainage structures
•
Road side drainage provisions as well as area drainage considerations
•
Safety features.
Any disregard ofthese aspects may well lead to unnecessary expenditure, since at a later date
the alignment may again have to be improved at considerable extra cost.
It is, therefore, imperative that
the final centre line ofthe road with respect to which, the improvements are designed and are to be carried
out, is fixed with great care in the light of ultimate geometric requirements and economy. The other
important point is removal ofstmctural deficiencies with an eye on future needs with respect to pavement,
culverts, road and area drainage requirement, etc.
4.3
Proper location and orientations ofcross-drainage structures is an important factor in the
selection ofthe road alignment. Their importance increases with their length and cost. In general for bridges

having length between 60 to 300 m, siting ofthe bridges as well as alignment ofthe approaches will have
equal priority and should be well co-ordinated. For bridges of length more than 300 m, siting for the
bridges will be primary guiding factor in route selection.

5. SURVEY OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE
5.1.
The economy of a region and its transport infrastructure are closely inter-related. The
economic justification for a highway project often depends upon the economic activities in the region and
potential for their fiirther growth. The growth oftraffic on the roads is likely to be closely govemed by the
inter-relationship between transport demand and certain selected economic indicators. A survey ofthe
economic profile is, thus, an important component in project preparation.
5.2.
The economic profile data are generally collected at two levels, v/z., (a) Region or State
and(b) Project hifluence Area. The regional economic profile gives an idea of how the economic growth
has taken place in relation to growth oftraffic, thus, giving a basis for estimation offixture growth oftraffic
for various scenarios ofeconomic growth. The Project Lifluence Area is the zone in the near vicinity of
the highway project such that investments in the project serve as a catalytic agent towards the speedy
development ofthe area. Such a development generates additional traffic other than the normal.
5.3.
The economic profile survey ofthe region should enable the presentation ofan overview
ofthe region's/State's economy, population and transport system over the past years and projected to
fijture years. The data should be collected for the past about ten years. This item is also covered in
Appendix-6.
5.4.
The socio-economic status ofthe Road Influence Area should provide a descriptive and
quantified profile from available data on population, agricultural production, area under crops, annual
industrial and mining production by type ofestablishment, tourism potential and the inputs and outputs
moving by road. Information on major planned development projects (type ofestablishment and expected
annual production) should be collected.
5.5.
The historical trend data should be analysed statistically to determine the growth trends
and elasticity oftraffic with respect to GDP, population, industrial production and agricultural output. The
planned rates ofgrowth ofthose selected indicators in the ftiture should be obtained.
6. TRAFFIC SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS
o
6.1.
General
Information about traffic is indispensable for any highway project since it would form the basis for
the design ofthe pavement, fixing the number of traffic lanes, design of intersections and economic
appraisal ofthe project, etc. Traffic surveys required to be conducted in connection with the preparation
ofroad project are as under:
(a)
Classified Traffic Volume Counts
(b)
Origin-Destination Surveys
* For assessing environmental impact of highway projects, a reference may be made to IRC publication "Guidelines
for Environmental Impact Assessment of Highway Projects", IRC: 104- 1988.

(f)

(g)

These are discussed below:
6.2.
Classified Traffic Volume Counts
Count oftraffic is the basic traffic study required in connection with many types ofhighway
projects. A system oftraffic census is in vogue in the country under which 7 day traffic counts are taken
once or twice a year. The data from these can be indiciously made use of, ifthe census points fall on the
proposed highway project. Time permitting, it is always desirable to under take fresh traffic surveys.
Guidance may be taken from IRC:9 "Traffic Census on Non-Urban Roads." The count stations should
be selected such that the results represent the traffic flow in homogeneous sections ofthe highway. A
seven day count will then give the Average Daily Traffic (ADT). This value may be converted to Annual
Average Daily Traffic (AADT) applying seasonal considerations and using conversion factors from any
continuous traffic count in the region.
When traffic census data from existing count stations are compiled,
it may^e found useftil to
collect past data (preferably about
1 0 years) so as to establish meaningful past ^v/th trends for each
vehicle class
. A typical proforma 1 given in this Chapter may be used.
•
6.3.
Origin-Destination (O-D) Surveys
6.3 . 1
.
When a new road is being planned, or extensive improvements are to be carried out to an
existing road, or a bypass is under consideration, the amount oftraffic likely to use it cannot be ascertained
from a simple census and it may become necessary to collect information about the origin and destination
oftraffic passing through the area in which the road is situated. The origin and destination data should be
comprehensive enough to cover all roads likely to be affected by the proposed scheme. The points at
which the data is collected should be careftiUy chosen on the road network such that it should be possible
to derive the volume oftraffic likely to use the facility under consideration.
6.3.2.
The survey should normally be conducted for three consecutive days, on sample basis if
possible during a representative week in the year and must encompass the weekly market day and one
working day. For exceptional cases, in heavy density corridors and where the daily variation in the traffic
is not much, at least one day's survey may be conducted on a normal working day. Care shall be taken
during interpretation ofthe data keeping in mind the seasonal variation oftraffic.
6.3.3.
There are several methods available for conducting an O-D survey. Information on them is
contained in IRC: 102 'Traffic Studies for Planning Bypasses Around Towns". Generally, the "Roadside
Interview Method" is well-suited for roads in rural areas and can be conveniently adopted. This consists
basically of interviewing drivers of vehicles at suitably located points with reference to the type ofroad
scheme in consideration. At these stations, the number as well as the type ofall vehicle passing the station
is recorded. However, only a percentage ofthe drivers at random need to be stopped and interviewed
for origin, destination and other travel particulars, like, commodity carried. The sampling should be
systematic. Generally,
1 5 to 20 per cent ofthe vehicles may be covered in the peak periods and 25 to 30
per cent in the normal periods.
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
6.3.4.
The sample should be upscaled to ADT and preferably hourly based classified vehicle
type. The location oforigin and destination zones will be detennined in relation to each individual station
and the possibility oftraffic diversion to the project road fi*om other road routes including bypasses. In
principle, the zoning should bisect areas where competing roads pass and the zonal configuration shall be
adequate on either side ofthe O-D station; thereafter, districts will serve as zones withiii the State. Zoning
outside the State will relate to individual or groups ofStates in accordance with the distance fix)m the O-
D station. For coding purposes, code lists or code maps (to be shown to motorists) will be prepared
giving zone number and towns within that zone. The updated (ADT) numbers shall then be presented by
trip matrix. Information on weight for trucks should, following up scaling to ADT, be summed up by
commodity type and the results tabulated, giving total weight and average weight per truck for the various
commodity types. Sample sizes for each vehicle type should also be indicated. A sample ofZonal Division
is indicated in Fig. 1.
Following processing ofthe O-D results, traffic is assigned fi*om the trip matrix's elements to the
project road's homogeneous sections, provided the route including the project roadin its improved condition
is the most desirable ofthe altemative routes available in terms of least vehicles operating costs.
6.4.
Speed and Delay Studies
'
Highway improvements result in spring up traffic and reducing congestion. Speed and delay
studies on the existing facility provide the basis for estimating the causative problems and benefits ofthe
improved facility. For this purpose typical proformae 2(a) and (b) given in this chaptermay be used.
The study is conveniently conducted by the "Moving Observer" method. By this method a test
vehicle is run along with the traffic stream, at approximately the perceptible average speed ofthe traffic
stream. A separate run is needed for each direction. The average ofaround six runs ensures accuracy
ofresults. By noting down the travel time, including actual running time and stopped delays, the vehicles
counted in the opposite direction and those overtaken/overtaking, it is possible to calculate the volume,
,
speed and delay. For fiirther information, IRC: 102 "Traffic Studies for Planning Bypasses Round
Towns" may be consulted. Proformae 3(aj to (d) given in this Chapter may be found useful for this survey.
6.5.
Traffic Surveys for the Design ofRoad Junctions
6.5.1.
Road junction design requires information on directional movement oftraffic in the peak
hour. For this purpose, it would be sufficient to have counts for 2 hours each in the moming and evening
peak periods unless there exist extended peak hours.
6.5 .2.
For simple 'T' or4-wayjunction, the survey could be conducted by stationing enumerators
on each arm ofthejunction to note the number ofvehicles entering through the arm and the direction of
their exit. At multi-leggedjunction or rotaries, quickjudgement about the exit direction or vehicles may not
be possible. In such cases, a licence plate survey may have to be conducted. This consists ofnoting the
registration numbers (generally only the last three digits) ofa sample ofvehicles entering the intersection
.
Simultaneously, on each exit, the registration numbers ofvehicles leaving thejunction are noted. The two
sets ofnumbers are then matched in the office to determine the directional movements. For recording
traffic movement at ajunction Table 3.1. Interesection Design Data given in IRC:SP:4 1 Guidelines for the
design ofAt-Grade interesections in rural and urban areas needs to be used.
6.5.3.
Usually,
it is not necessary to conduct traffic surveys onjunctions where traffic on the
minor cross road is less than about 1 00 vehicles per day.
6.5.4.
Special pedestrian survey needs to be conducted when the alignment passes by such

locations, (e.g., school, well, etc. on one side ofalignment and the village on the other side), to decide the
provision ofappropriate crossing, such as, subway.
6.6.
Traffic Surveys for Replacing Railway Level Crossings with Over Bridges/Subways
6.6.1.
Present criteria ofreplacing railway level crossings with over bridges/underpasses are
based on the product ofgate closures and fast traffic per day. For this purpose, counts should be taken
in a week spread over three consecutive days and 24 hours each day ifsuch information is not already
available. The number and duration ofgate closures should be ascertained from the Railway Authorities
and also counted at site by conducting a 24 hours survey.
6.6.2.
Information should also be obtained on the angle ofcrossing ofthe roadway and the
railway. In case the road alignment has curves near the railway crossing, to make it a perpendicular
crossing, an index plan including these curves and the straight alignment beyond, should also be included to
study the feasibility ofimproving the road alignment as part ofthe project for replacing the level crossing.
6.7.
Axle Load Survey
Axle load survey is needed to generate data for pavement design. Portable weigh bridges are very
useful for this purpose.
This survey shall be carried out along with classified volume count survey. Number ofdays of
survey will depend on project location, the type ofproject and the intensity and expected variation in
traffic. This survey duration may vary between 24 hours and 3 days, but should be carried out at least for
one day at the traffic count stations on a random basis for commercial vehicles. Buses may be omitted as
their weight can be easily calculated and they do not result in excessive overloads.
The period ofconducting the survey should also be judiciously selected keeping in view the
movement ofcommodity/destination oriented dedicated type ofcommercial vehicles.
While finalising the design Equivalent Standard Axle load, the following should be considered
(i)
Past axle load spectrum in the region as well as on the road to the extent available
(ii)
Annual variation in commercial vehicles
(iii)
Optimistic and pessimistic considerations offuture generation of traffic
(iv)
Generation of changing VDF factor during the project period
A typical proforma 4 given in this chapter may be found usefiil for this survey.
6.8.
Accident Records
Ifaccident records are maintained in a methodical manner, they form a good basis for designing
the improvements at accident-prone locations on existing roads. Such records, ifavailable, should invariably
be consulted before deciding the improvement measures.
6.9.
Traffic Projection
6.9.1.
Traffic counts and 0-D surveys would provide information about present traffic on the
road (in the case ofexisting roads),
or the possible diverted traffic (in the case ofnew construction, such
as, bypasses). For design purpose, however, it is necessary that classified traffic should be predicted for
the future horizon year for which the facility is to be designed.
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:19-20G{
6.9.2.
Pericxl ofprojection dqjends on the type ofthe proj ect, importance ofthe road, availability
offinances and other related factors. For major trunk routes, the desirable and minimum forecast periods
are 20 and 1 0 years, (excluding the period ofconstruction) though occasionally an even shorter period
could be adopted depending on the policies ofstage construction. In the case oflower category roads, the
desirable period ofprojection is 10 years but it should not be less than 5 years.
6.9.3.
Traffic growth should be assessed in the first instance on the basis ofobserved trend of
traffic in the recent years and other economic indicators using the technique given in Appendix-2. In this
connection the Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways, IRC: 108 may be referred to. If
reliable information is not available, as a broad guide, a compound growth rate of 7.5 per cent per annum
could be adopted for this purpose. Because ofthe many uncertainties surrounding the possible shape of
future population, incomes, production, goods generation, etc.,
it is necessary that estimates of traffic
based purely on past rates ofgrowth should be used with caution.
6.9.4.
Forecast oftraffic based on past trends should also be modified for 'generated' traffic that
may be using the highway facility after it is constmcted. Generated traffic is quite distinct fi"om the diverted
traffic and represents journeys induced by reducedjourney times and higher level of travel comfort which
would not otherwise have been made.
It is not necessary to allow for generated traffic on small schemes,
but this may be called for on comparatively larger projects. Estimation of generated traffic should be
attempted after consulting standard literature on this subject.
7. RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY
7.1.
Purpose
7.1.1.
The main objective ofreconnaissance survey is to examine the general character ofthe
area for the purfX)seofdetermining the most feasible route, or routes, forftirther more detailed investigations.
Data collected should be adequate to examine the feasibility of all the different routes in question, as also
to flimish the Engineer-in-charge with approximate estimates ofquantities and costs, so as to enable him to
decide on the most suitable altemative or alternatives. The survey should also help in determining any
deviations necessary in the basic geometric standards to be adopted for the highway facility.
7.2.
Survey Method
7.2.1.
The reconnaissance survey may be conducted in the following sequence
(a)
Study of topographical
survey sheets, agricultural, soil, geological and meteorological maps,
and aerial photographs, if available
(b)
Aerial reconnaissance (where necessary and feasible),
(c)
Ground reconnaissance (including another round of aerial reconnaissance for inaccessible and
difficult stretches, where called for)
7.3.
Study of Survey
Sheets, Maps, etc.
7.3.1.
Reconnaissance begins with a study of all the available maps. The types ofusefiil map
informations which are currently available in the country are as below:
(a)
Survey of India (SOI) Maps.
(i)
The most useful maps are the topographical sheets available in the scale of 1 ;25,000,
1 :50,000
and 1:250,000.

Maps coverage on 1 :S0,000 and 1 :2S0,000 scale are available for the Vi/boVs ofIndia but raap
coverage with the preferable scale of 1 :25,000 is at present, availabk ooHty Ua about 30 per
cent of the country.
(iO
State maps on scale 1:1,000,000.
These are useful as index maps or to indicate an overview of the project location and are
available for most of the States.
(iii) Plastic ReliefMaps on scale 1:15,000,000.
One may be lucky to have these maps for certain regions. For very difRcult^eas highway
location planning may be very much helped if these three dimensional maps delineating
ridges, valleys, peaks, etc. with contour information are available.
(b)
Apart from the above-mentioned SOI maps there are special purpose maps, like, Forest Survey
of India, Vegetation Maps on scale 1 :25,000,000 showing incidence oforchards, reserve forests,
clusters of social forestry areas, etc. which may be helpful in special cases in selection of
alignment.
Also, maps prepared by National Bureau ofSoil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP)
indicating infonnation on Soil, Wasteland, etc. and Geological Survey ofIndia Maps (on scale 1 :250,000
or smaller) with information on geology, geomoiphology and changes in drainage, river courses, etc. are
available for many areas.
These maps may also be fruitfully used when considered necessary.
7.3.2.
After study ofthe topogr^hical features on the maps, anumber ofalignments feasible in
a general way are selected keeping in view the following points
:
(i)
The alignment should take into accoimt all the contiol points and should be the shortest and
most economical compatible with the requirements ofgradie^ and curvature.
(iO
Shape of the alignments.
(iii^ Avoidance, as far as possible, of marshy ground, steep terrain, unstable hill features and areas
subject to severe climatic conditions, flooding and inundation.
(iv) Need of connecting important villages and towns.
(v)
Bridging
cross-drainage and drainage problems. (Guiding principle stated in para 4.2 shall be
kept in view).
(vi) Need to preserve environment and maintain ecological balance.
7.3.3.
If photographs ofthe area are not available, but their need is considered inqjerative, aerial
photography maybe arranged for further study in the interest of overall economy.
The present status ofAerial Photography (AP) in India is that AP on scale 1 :50,000 is available
for the whole ofIndia. Depending on their quality the negatives ofthese photographs, when necessary, can
be enlarged easily by about five times without losing clarity and thus obtainAP enlargements on scale of
1:5,000 to 1:20,000.
These enlargements are quite adequate for the study of:
(i)
Geology, geomorphology and groimdwater prospecting and
(ii)
Environmental factors, e.g., vegetation, soil condition, land use etc.
Ifstereoscopic techniques are applied, aerial photogr^hs can yield quantitative data showing the
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 124
======================================================================
IRGSP: 19-2001
terrain in three dimension and ifstudied by a skilled photo-interpreter, can give significant soil and sub-soil
information.
7.3.4.
Photogrammetry support to highway engineering: Photogrammetry technology is
also useful to the highway engineer in many ways. Large scale maps on scales at
1 :2,000 to
1 :25,000 can
be very precisely produced through photogrammetric process. The contouring can also be produced, the
common interval depending on the height ofthe camera. Very minute and precise measurements amounting
to sub-metre accuracy can be obtained. In other words, profile (with height values) and cross-sections
across highway centre-line can be extracted fi^om optical model.
7.3.5.
Satellite remote sensing: This technique is used with the help of satellites. At present,
it gives a resolution ofthe order of6 metres. Photographic products ofimagery are available from National
Remote Sensing Agency, Hyderabad on scales of 1
: 12,500,
1 :25,000 and
1 :50,000. Digital products are
also available in floppy cartridge and tapes.
The cartridge/tape can be digitally processed in the computer and the image on the monitor can be
interpreted with the possibility ofenhancement ofquality through manipulation ofimage processing software.
Major advantages ofsatellite imagery is its repeatability as orbiting satellites visit the same spot on
earth every few weeks. Thus, the latest information regarding the physical features (like, the extent of a
town or urban area, etc.) can be obtained to update on available map.The information on natural resources
namely, geology, geomorphology, land use, soil status (waterlogging, erosion, etc.), drainage, forest extent,
etc. as available may be most useful input for the planners ofhighway alignment.
7.3.6.
Small format aerial photography (SFAP):
In case of large projects with mapping as
one ofthe main objectives conventional aerial photography in traditional format (23 cm x 23 cm) may also
be useful.
There are at least three known agencies in India for such aerial photography, namely, the
National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad, Air Survey Company, Calcutta and the Indian
Air Force.
All aerial photography work requires clearance from the Ministry ofDefence.
The major advantages ofSFAP are:
Very large scale true colour photo enlargements can be done in scales upto
1
: 1 ,000 to
1 :2,000 (upto scales
of 1
: 1 0,000). Acquisition plans along side highways can be suitably made in scale of 1 :4,000.
Monitoring of urban areas, villages and environment along the corridor are possible at comparatively
lower cost than ground surveys.
7.4.
Aerial Reconnaissance
7.4.1.
An aerial reconnaissance will provide a bird's
eyeview of the alignments under
consideration along with the surrounding area.
It will help to identify factors which call for rejection or
modification ofany ofthe alignment. Final decision about the alignments to be studied in detail on the
ground could be taken on the basis ofthe aerial reconnaissance.
7.5.
Ground Reconnaissance
7.5.1.
The various alternative routes located as a result ofthe map study are further examined in
the field by ground reconnaissance. As such, tliis part ofthe survey
is an important link in the chain of
activities leading to selection ofthe final route.
7.5.2.
General reconnaissance consists ofgeneral examination of the ground walking or riding
22



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:19-2001
along the probable route and collecting all available information necessary for evaluating the same. In
the case of hill sections, it may some time be advantageous to start the reconnaissance fiom the obligatory
point situated close to the top.
If an area is inaccessible for the purposes ofground reconnaissance,
recourse may be had to aerial reconnaissance to clear the doubts.
7.5.3.
While carrying out ground reconnaissance, it
is advisable to leave reference pegs to
fecilitate further survey operations.
7.5.4.
Instruments generally used during ground reconnaissance include compass, Abney level/
Alti-meter, Pedometer, Aneroid barometer, Clinometer, Ghat tracer, etc. Walkie-talkie sets, mobile phones
aiKi pagers are useful for communication, particularly in difficult terrain. Use ofthe instruments mentioned
above to obtain ground slopes, maximum gradients, elevation ofcritical summits or stream crossings, and
location ofobligatory points, serve as a check on the maps being used.
In difficult hilly and forest terrain assistance ofnew technology, like. Global Positioning System
(GPS) or Differential GPS (DGPS) may also be taken where the magnitude and importance ofthe work
justify their provision. GPS is a comparatively new technology which utilises the satellites orbiting around
the earth. A minimum offour satellites are needed to indicate the co-ordinates (X, Y, Z) on the ground at
any time ofday and night. The observations are made to an accuracy ofnearly a few metres or so. For
more precise work with accuracy ofa few centimetres, two geo-receivers are used and this mode ofusing
two GPS is known as differential GPS (DGPS).
7.5.5.
Points on which data rnay be collected during ground recoimaissance are listed in
AppendiX'3,
7.6.
Reconnaissance Report
Based on the information collected during the reconnaissance survey, a report should be prepared.
The report should include all relevant information collected during the survey, a plan to the scale of 1 :50,000
or larger as available showing the altemative alignments studied alongwith their general profile and rough
cost estimates
.
It should discuss the merits and demerits ofthe different altematives to help the selection
ofone ormore alignments for detailed survey and investigation.
8. PRELIMINARY SURVEY
8.1.
Purpose
8.1.1.
The preliminary survey is a relatively large scale instrument survey conducted for the purpose
of collecting all the physical information which affects the proposed location of a new highway or
improvements to an existing highway. In the case ofnew roads, it consists ofrunning an accurate traverse
line along the route previously selected on the basis ofthe reconnaissance survey. In the case ofexisting
roads where only improvements are proposed, the survey line is run along the existing alignment. During
this phase ofthe survey, topographic features and other features, like, houses, monuments, places of
worship, cremation or burial grounds, utility lines, existing road and railway lines, stream, river, canal
crossings, cross-drainage structures, etc. are tied to the traverse line. Longitudinal-sections and cross-
sections, are taken and bench marks established. The data collected at this stage will form the basis for the
determination ofthe final centre line ofthe road. For this reason, it is essential that every precaution should
be taken to maintain a high degree ofaccuracy.
8.1.2.
Besides the above, genial information which may be useful in fixing design features within
close limits is collected during this phase. The information may concem traffic, soil, constmction materials,
23



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 19^2001
drainage, etc. and may be collected from existing records as through intelligent inspection/simple
measurements. Detailed investigations dealt with in section 10 through 16 are not envisaged at
this stage.
It may be found convenient to divide the road into homogeneous sections from traffic
consideration and prepare a typical estimate for one km stretch as representative ofeach homogeneous
section. With the data collected, it should be possible to prepare rough cost estimates within reasonably
close limits for obtaining administrative approval, if not already accorded and forplanning finther detailed
survey and investigations. Li particular, infomiationmay be collected regarding
:
(0
The highest sub-soil and flood water levels, the variation between the maximum^ and minimum,
and the nature and extent of inundation, if any, gathered from local enquires or other records.
These should be correlated to data about the maximiun and minimum rainfall and its duration and
spacing, etc. by appropriate hydrological analysis.
(ii)
The character of embankment foundations including the presence of any unstable strata likes
micaceous schists, poor drainage or marshy areas; etc. This is particularly necessary in areas
having deep cuts to achieve the grade.
°
,
(iii)
Any particular construction problem ofthe area, like, sub-terranean flow, high level water storage
resulting in steep hydraulic gradient across the alignment canal crossings- and their closure
periods.
Information regarding earlier failure? in the area of slides or settlements of slopes,
embankments and foundation, together with causes thereto may also be gathered from records
and enquiry where feasible.
(iv)
In cut sections, the nature of rock
i.e., hard, soft etc. should be determined by trial pits or
boreholes. This is essential to make realistic
cost estimates.
8.2.
Survey Procedure
8.2.1.
The preliminary survey starts with running ofa traverse along the selected route, adhering
as far as possible to the probable final centre line ofthe road. In difficult situations, a secondary traverse
connected to the primary one at either end may also be run. In hilly areas, a trace cut 1 .0 to 1 .2 m wide,
ifrequired may be made during the preliminary survey. For details in this regard, reference may be made
to IRC:52 *'Recommendations About the Alignment Survey and Geometric Design ofHill Roads".
8.2.2.
The traverse consists ofa series ofstraight lines with their lengths and intermediate angles
measured very carefully. In difficult terrain, the alignment may have to be negotiated through a series of
short chords, preferably, the travCTse should be done with a theodolite with Electronic Distance Measurement
(EDM) and all angles measured with double reversal method. Global Positioning System (GPS) is also
very useful and appropriate for preliminary survey. The GPS will give locations in co-ordinates all the
necessary points on the traverse. GPS is very fast reasonably accurate for preliminary system and computer
friendly for data transfer. Control pillars in cement concrete should be fixed at suitable interval (ranging
from 500m to 2 kms) to have control on accuracy. It also helps in repeating the survey, ifrequired, within
the control pillars.
8.2.3.
Distances along the traverse line shouldbe measured withEDM or total statioa An accuracy
ofat least
1 in 10000 should be aimed at mall distance measurement.
8.2.4.
No hard and fast rule can be laid down as regards distance between two consecutive
transit stations^ In practice, the interval will be dictated by directional changes in the alignment, terrain
conditions and visibility. The transit stations should be marked by means of stakes and numbered in
sequence. These should be protected and preserved till the fmal location survey.
8.2.5.
Physical features, such as, buildings, monuments, burial grounds, cremation grounds, places
24



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
ofworship, posts, pipelines, existing roads and railway lines, stream/'river/canal crossings, cross-drainage
structures, etc.
that are likely to affect the project proposals should be located by means of offsets
measured from the traverse line. Where the survey is for improving or upgrading an existing road,
measurements should also be made for existing carriageway, roadway and location and radii ofhorizontal
curves. In case ofhighways in rolling and hilly terrain the nature and extent ofgrades, ridges and valleys
and vertical curves should necessarily be covered. The width of land to be surveyed will depend on the
category ofroad, purpose ofthe project, terrain and other related factors. Generally, the survey should
cover the entire right-of-way ofthe road, with adequate allowance for possible shifting ofthe centre line
from the traverse line.
8.2.6.
Levelling woric during a preliminary survey is usually kept to the minimum. Generally, fly
levels are taken along the traverse line at 50 metre intervals and at all intermediate breaks in ground. To
draw contours ofthe strip ofland surveyed, cross-sections should b<; taken at suitable intervals, generally
1 00 to 250m in plain terrain, upto 50m in rolling terrain, and upto 20 m in hilly terrain. To facilitate the
levelling work, bench marks, either temporary or permanent, should be established at intervals of250 to
500 metres. The levels should be connected to GTS datum.
8.2.7.
Field notes ofthe survey should be clear and concise, yet comprehensive enough for easy
and accurate plotting.
8.2.8.
Apart from traverse survey, general information about traffic, soil, drainage should be
collected while the traverse is being run, as mentioned in para 8. 1 .2.
8.2.9.
Checklist on preliminary survey is available in y4/?/?^«</«:-¥.
8.3.
Map Preparation
8.3.1.
Plans and longitudinal sections (tied to an accurate base line) prepared as a sequel to the
preliminary survey are referred to for detailed study to determine tlie final centre line ofthe road. At critical
locations, like, sharp curves, hair-pin bends, bridge crossings, etc., the plan should also show contours at
1 -3 metre intervals,
particularly for roads in rolling or hilly terrain so as to facilitate the final decision.
8.3.2.
Scales for the maps should generally be the same as adopted forthe final drawings. The
following scales are suggested:
(i)
Built-up areas and stretches in hilly terrain- 1
: 1 ,000 for horizontal scale and
1 : 1 00 for vertical
scale.
(ii)
Plain and rolling terrain- 1:2,500 for horizontal scale and 1:250 for vertical scale.
8.3.3.
For study ofdifficult locations, such as, steep terrain, hair-pin bends, sharp curves, bridge
crossings, etc.
it may be convenient to have plans to a larger scale than recommended above. Ifnecessary
these plans may show contours preferably at 2 m interval, though this could be varied to 1 .5 m according
to site condition.
9. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY AND RESETTLEMENT
AND REHABILTATION ACTION PLAN
9. 1
.
General
9.1.1
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has become an integral part ofhighway
project preparation work. The main purpose ofEIA is to identify the environmental impact ofthe project
proposal and its different altematives, weigh their significance and severance, propose possible mitigating
25



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 19-2001
measures and provide necessary information for taking decision regarding the overall acceptability ofthe
project fiom environmental angle.
9.1.2.
The subject is being briefly described in the following paragraphs but in all cases ofactual
project preparation the provision in the "Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment ofHighway
Projects" (IRC: 1 04) togetherwith relevant guidelines and instructions issuedby the Ministry ofEnvironment
and Forests shall be followed as guiding principles.
9.1.3.
The EIA comprises mainly ofthe following four elements:
(i)
Preliminary Screening and Environmental Analysis
(ii)
Environmental Design
(iii)
Compliance of Coastal Regulation Zonal requirements
(iv)
Environmental Management Action Plan
In most cases the second element i.e. Environmental Design within its Scope will have a brief
socio-economic base-line study, assessment ofspecial requirements ofForests and Coastal Regulatory
Zones and preparation ofa Resettlement and Preliminary Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) may become
necessary.
9.1.4.
Interalia the following legislation need due consideration:
Environmental (protection) Act, 1986
Wild life (protection) Act 1972
Forest(conservation) Act, 1980
Water (prevention and control ofpollution) Act
, 1 98 1 (amended 1 987)
Air (prevention and control ofpollution) Act ,1981 (amended 1987)
Coastal Zone Regulation
The latest versions/amendments shall be used.
9.1.5.
The provisions in the Notification ofthe Government ofIndia in Ministry ofEnvironment
and Forest N.O. S.O. 3 1 8 (E) published in Gazette Extraordinary N.0. 244 dt. 10-4-1997 shall also be
kept in view. The projects relating to improvement works including widening and strengthening
with marginal land acquisition of roads along the existing alignments irrespective of the cost
component is exemptedfrom obtaining environmental clearancefrom Ministry ofEnvironment
and Forest,
9. 1 .6.
Salient features ofMOEF "Environmental Guidelines forHighway Projects" are covered
in Appendix-ll.
9.2.
Environmental Analysis
9.2.1. A preliminary environmental/screening ofthe highway may be carried out to detemiine the
magnitude of actual and potential impact and ensure that environmental considerations are given adequate
weightage in the selection and design ofthe highway improvement/constmction proposals.
In Appendix-5, a chart for Initial Environment Examination (lEE) and suggested grading and
protection measures have been indicated.
9.2.2.
Information should be collected on existing environmental conditions and a preliminary
evaluation ofthe alignment selected for improvement/construction in order to determine the focus of
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19^2001
environmental assessments, design and management Studies.
9.2.3.
Positive and negative impacts ofupgrading the highway or constructing a new highway
shall be identified. Cost-effective measures may be proposed to enhance the positive impacts and to
avoid ormitigate the effect ofnegative impacts.
9.2.4.
Where felt necessary, public consultation with the affected groups or involved NGO's
may be carried out.
9.3.
Environmental Design
9.3.1.
From the Environmental analysis all elements with potential for adverse impacts should be
identified, for which steps can then be taken to avoid/mitigate through judicious design changes (e.g.,
shifting the road alignment to save trees on one side ofthe road). Adverse impacts, such as, soil erosion,
fiodding, loss ofvegetation cover, etc. should be identified*and appropriate mitigating measures, like,
ground cover planting, installation ofproper drainage system, etc. incorporated in design to reduce the
impact. Cost effective proposals may also be included in the design proposal to suitably upgrade or
enhance the environmental quality along the highway or the new alignment in a sustainable manner. Where
possible a few stretches along the project road may be selected for provision offacilities for non-motorised
transport whichmay provide an indirect encouragement to enhancement ofenvironmental quality.
9.4.
Environmental Management Action Plan
9.4. 1 .
An implementation schedule and supervision programme may be prepared for timely
execution ofenvironmental mitigation and design works and all efforts may be made to stick to it.
In important cases the programme for monitoring environmental impacts during construction and
operation should be developed.
For large projects, the requirement for institutional strengthening and training facility for personnel
to be dq)loyed on environmental works should be specified.
Any further studies ofenvironmental issues, which are required to be undertaken during project
implementation should be recommended.
9.5.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP)
9.5^ 1 .
Whenever the project will entail acquisition ofland, structures and other assets and cause
di^lac^oit or loss ofassets within the public right-of-way, the project should undertake a socio-economic
base-line study and prepare a Re-settlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP).
9.5.2.
Broadly speaking, the RAP has three main objectives:
(a)
To assess and bring out the impacts of land acquisition and assets for the project civil works
on the people who own properties in the area to be acquired or live on the land to be acquired
and/or derive their income from the land or own enterprises operating on the land to be acquired,
(b)
To present-the entitlement policy for compensation and assistance to people affected by the
project, and
(c)
To prepare an action plan for delivery ofcompensation and assistance outlined in the poUcy to
the persons duly identified as entitled to such assistance.
9.5.3.
The present policy ofthe Government is that the population adversely affected by the
project should receive benefits from it or at the least, they should not be worse offthan before because of
27



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 124
======================================================================
IRC.SP: 19-2001
the project. Since acquisition ofland and other assets may be unavoidable and an integral part ofproject
design and implementation, undertaking a social impact assessment and preparingRAP may also be included
as a part ofproj ect design from the start and undertaken in close co-ordination with environmental analysis
and environmental action plan. Also, as far as possible, involuntary settlement may be avoided or at least
rniiiiinised wherever possible, by exploring other altemative project designs.
9.5.4.
The initial screening ofsocial and environmental impacts should be a part offinal selection
ofahgnment. hi this connection the initial Environmental Examination grading suggested in the table in
Appendix-5 may be seen.
9.5.5.
In cases where displacement, loss of assets or other negative impacts on people are
unavoidable, the project should assist the affected persons with means to improve their former living
standards, income-earning capacities, production levels or at least maintain the previous standards of
living
9.5.6.
Since no civil work can be undertaken on any stretch ofroad before land acquisition and
payment ofcompensation as per RAP, it is essential that planning and implementation ofcivil works may
be co-ordinated with RAP.
9.5.7.
Preparation ofRAP requires a thorough understanding ofthe local people, and the social,
economic and cultural factors influencing their lives. It is essential that detailed base-line studies are conducted
with a participatory approach through consultation with potentially affected persons and other stake holders
in the area, the local NGO's, municipal authorities,
etc. and a mutually satisfactory solution
is achieved.
10. FEASIBILITY REPORT
10.1.
A Feasibility Report is prepared after the preliminary survey is completed. The report is
intended to serve as the basis for according Administrative Approval (AA)
for the project by the
Highway Department/Public Works Department. When International fiinding is sought, it forms the basis
for entering into negotiations with the funding agency and concluding an agreement for loan. The Feasibility
Report must establish the economic viability and technical soundness ofthe altemative selected. Thus, it
must be preceded by the engineering surveys and investigations ofsufficient accuracy and detail as to result
in a fairly firm estimation ofthe cost ofthe project.
It must be based on accurate traffic projections and
must contain an economic analysis.
10.2.
A full account ofthe socio-economic profile ofthe state and the Road Influence Area must
be given in the Feasibility Report. The transport infi^tructure ofthe stage must be fully described, giving
details ofthe road/road transport sector.
The Feasibility Reportmay include discussion on different altemative alignments, altemativepavement
design for deciding the one most suitable as final option.
Feasibility ofstage construction should also be examined in the light ofthe rate ofgrowth oftraffic
and other relevant parameters.
10.3.
A briefoutline ofthe organisational structure ofthe Public Works Department must be
given, establishing its adequacy in handling the project and giving details ofany augmentation support
system proposed.

1 0.4.
The Report should give a briefdescription ofthe scope ofthe project, its need, sources of
funding, budget and plan provision, selection ofroi te alignment, cross-sectional elements, drainage facilities
and construction technology.
10.5.
The methodology adopted for the various studies must be described. These include traffic
surveys: soils; materials and sub-soil investigation; hydrological and drainage studies.
10.6.
The design standards and methodology adopted must be explained.
1 0.7.
The Report must contain a reasonably accurate estimate of costs, giving the basis for
adopted rates. Any provision for escalation ofcosts mus* ^^e explained.
10.8.
The implementation programme involving prequalification, bidding, constmction siq>ervision
and contract management must be drawn up and presented in the form ofbar chart.
1 0.9.
The economic analysis must be based on current costs. The IRC Manual on Economic
Analysis ofHighway Projects (Special Publication No. 30) gives details ofthe procedure that may be
adopted. Some other models like HDM III or its latest revision developed by the World Bank, RTEM III
developed by Transport Research Laboratory U.K. after suitable calibration for Indian conditions also
can be used if so desired. A sensitivity analysis must be presented for the following cases:

11. SELECTION OF OPTIMUM ALIGNMENT IN THE DESIGN OFFICE
11.1.
Determination ofthe final centre line ofthe road in the office is a forerunner to the final
location survey. This involves the following operations
:
(i)
Making use of the maps from preliminary survey (see para 8.3) showing the longitudinal
profile, cross-sections and contours, a few alternative alignments for the final centre line of
the road are drawn and studied and the best one satisfying the engineering, aesthetic and
economic requirements selected.
(ii)
For the selected alignment, a trial gradeline is drawn taking into account the controls which
are established by intersections, railway crossings, streams and other drainage requu-ements.
In the case of improvements of an existing road, the existing road levels are also kept in view.
(iii)
For the selected alignment, a study of the horizontal alignment in conjunction with the
profile is carried out and adjustments made in both as necessary for achieving proper co-
ordination.
(iv)
Horizontal curves including transitions with adequate provision for visibility are designed
and final centre line marked on the map.
(v)
The vertical curves are designed and the profile determined.
1 1 .2.
The alignment determined in the design office shall be cross checked in the field, specially
when the data base is not adequately updated.
11.3.
Determination ofthe final centre line ofthe road forms the appropriate stage for preparing
plans and estimates for land acquisition. Land acquisition proceedings involve time and these need not
wait till the preparation ofthe detailed project report especially, ifadministrative approval has already
been obtained.

12. FINAL LOCATION SURVEY
12.1.
Purpose
12.1.1. The purpose ofthe final location survey is to lay out the centre lines ofthe road in the field
based on the alignment selected in the design office and to collect necessary data for the preparation of
working drawings. The completeness and accuracy ofthe project drawings and estimates of quantities
depend a great deal on the precision with which this survey is carried out. The accuracy of the survey
should be test checked by the senior professionals ofthe concemed authority. This will also generate the
precise land acquisition requirements.
12.1.2. The two main operations involved in the survey are the staking out ofthe final centre line of
the road by means ofa continuous survey and detailed levelling.
12.2.
Staking Final Centre Line
12.2.1. The centre line ofthe road, as determined in the design office, is translated on the ground
by means of continuous transit survey and staking of the centre line as the survey proceeds. Double
reversal method should be adopted at all horizontal intersecfion points (H.I.P.) and intermediate points of
transit (POT) on long tangents. The H.I.Ps. should be fixed on hubs driven flush with the ground and
suitably referenced so that they may be readily located. Usually, these should be serially numbered for
easy identification and shall be defined by coordinates. On long tangents, the intermediate transit points
(POTs) should also be fixed on hubs in the case ofnew roads, and by means ofspikes or nails driven into
the pavement in the case of existing roads with proper referencing. Method ofreferencing H.I.Ps. and
POTs is illustrated in Fig. 12.1 and is also shown in Plate-2.

======================================================================
IRC:SP: 19-2001
12.2.2. The reference points should be so located that these will not be disturbed during construction.
Description and location by coordinate ofthe reference points should be noted for reproduction on the
final plan drawings.
1 2.2.3. All the curve points, namely the beginning of spiral transition curve (BS), beginning of
circular curve (BC), end ofcircular curve (EC) and the end ofspiral transition (ES) should be firmed and
referenced in the same manner as for POTs described earlier. (For the procedure of setting curves,
reference may be made to IRC:38 "Design Tables ofHorizontal Curves for Highways").
12.2.4. The final centre line ofthe road should be suitably staked. Stakes
should be fixed at 50
metre intervals in plain and rolling terrain, and 20 metre intervals in hilly terrain. The stakes are intended
only for short period for taking levels ofthe ground along the centre line and cross-section with reference
thereto. In the case ofexisting roads, paint marks with button headed steer nails may be used instead of
stakes.
12.2.5. Distance measurements along the final centre line should be continuous following the
horizontal curves where these occur.
12.2.6. The traverse in case of road alignment would be open and should be controlled by
establishing control points to be established by sophisticated G.P.S. or by astronomical observations or by
running cut-offlines between certain intermediate stations.
1 2.2.7. At road crossings, the angles which the intersecting roads make with the final centre line
should be measured. Similar measurement should be made at railway level crossings.
12.3.
Bench Marks
1 2.3. 1
. To establish firm vertical control for location, design and construction, permanent bench
marks should be established at intervals of 2 km and temporary bench marks has intervals of250 metres
(exceptionally 500 metres), and at or near ail drainage or underpass structures. Reference points for
POTs andHIPs, as shown in Fig. 12.1 could also be used as bench marks.
It is particularly important
that a single datum, preferable GTS datum, should be used to tie up all the levels. For bench mark
levelling, check levels should be run over the entire line back to the first bench mark.
12.4.
Longitudinal Sections and Cross-Sections
12.4.1. Levels along the final centre line should be taken at all staked stations (Refer sub-para
1
1 .4.2) and at all breaks in the ground.
12.4.2. Cross-secfions should be generally taken at 50-100 metre intervals to plain terrain and
50-75 metre in rolling terrain depending on the nature ofwork. Preferred distance for existing roads are
built-up situafions is 50 m. The interval should be still less in hilly terrain, about 20 m. In addition, cross-
sections should be taken at points of beginning and end ofspiral transition curves, at the beginning, middle
and end ofcircular curves, and at other critical locations. All cross-sections should be with reference to the
final centre line, extended normally up to the right-of-way limit, and show levels at every 2-5 metres
intervals and at all breaks in the profile.
1 2.4.3. Centre line profile should normally be continued at least 200 metres beyond the limits of
the project. This is intended to ensure proper connecting grades at both ends. With the same objective,
profile along all intersecting roads should be measured upto a distance ofabout
1 50 metres. Further, at
railway level crossings, the level ofthe top ofthe rails, and in the case ofsubways, the level ofthe roof
32



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19^2001
should be noted. On existing roads, levels should be taken at all points of intersection m order to help the
fixation ofprofile.
12.5.
Proper Protection of Points of Reference
12.5.1. The final location survey is considered complete when all the necessary information is
available and ready for the designer to be able to plot the final road profile and prepare the project
drawings. Among other things, field notes should give a clear description and locas ton ofall the bench
maiics and reference points. The information should be transferred to the plan drawing ;s, :io thai at the time
ofconstruction the centre line and the bench marks could be located in the field witho it any difficulty.
1 2 . 5 .2 . At the time ofexecution,
all construction lines will be set out and cht; eked with reference
to the final centre line established during the final location survey.
It is important, therefore, that not only all
the points referencing the centre line should be protected and preserved but these an ; so fixed at site that
there is little possibility oftheir being disturbed or removed till the construction is cor ipleted.
1 2.5 .3 . A checklist indicating the major operations involved in the difTereor rypes ofsurvey and
investigation for a road project is given in Appendix-4.
13. SOIL AND MATERIALS SURVEYS
13.1.
General
13.1.1. Investigations for soil and other materials required for constmctioo are carried out in respect
ofthe likely sources and the availability and suitability ofmaterials. Some other investigations, for instance
in respect oflandslide prone locations may also be conducted at this stage.
1 3 . 1 .2. In particular soil and materials surveys are required:
(i)
to determine the nature and physical characteristics of soil and soil profile for design of
embankment and pavement
(ii)
to determine the salt content in soil in areas known to have problems o
' v/here the composition
of the design crust requires such testing
(iii)
to determine the proper method(s) of handling soils
(iv)
to classify the earthwork involved into various categories such as rock excavation, earthwork
in hard soil etc.
-
.
(v)
to gather general information regarding sub-soil water level and flooding; and
(vi)
to locate sources for aggregates required for pavement and structures and to ascertain their
availability and suitability for use.
\
(vii)
locate source ofgood quality water suitable for use in different items and work particularly the
current work.
13.2.
Study of Available Information
1 3.2. 1
. The soil and materials location surveys should include study of all available information
such as geological maps, data published by the various authorities regarding location ofconstmction materials
and the information available with ground water authorities regarding depth of water table. Soil maps
prepared by the local agricultural department and records ofexisting highways may also provide useful
information. A study ofthese data, ifavailable, will be ofgreat help in the planning and conduct offurther
surveys and investigations. This information should be perused in conjunction with general information
gathered during the preliminary survey (see para 8.1 .2).
13.2.2. After studying the available information, detailed programme ofsurvey can be drawn up.
Points needing attention during detailed soil survey are highlighted further on.

1 3.3.
Soil Investigations for Low Embankments
13.3.1. The first operation in the detai led soil survey is to demarcate the possible borrow areas.
While demarcating borrow areas within the road land, the directions contained in IRC: 1 0 "Recommended
Practice for Borrowpits for Road Embankment Constructed by Manual Operation" should be kept in
view. The extent ofborrow areas should be commensurate with the volume ofwork involved in the
embankment.
13.3.2. The general character ofmaterial excavated from test pits should be recorded and tests
conducted on it in the laboratory for properties mentioned further on. Where the type on material varies in
a single pit, the tests should be conducted on each type of soil separately and the horizon ofoccurrence
noted. Similar tests should be carried out on material from cuts for ascertaining the suitability ofits use in
the embankment.

(iv)

However, in case ofhighly plastic poorly draining and unstable soils, some additional soil tests,
(e.g. shrinkage limit test) may also need to be performed before accepting the same either for foundation
or borrow.
13.3.4. The results ofthe laboratory investigations should be summarised in a convenient form for
which a proforma is suggested in Table 1
. Usually this information should be enclosed in full with the
project report. Based on results ofthe tests, sand content, and classification ofthe soil vide IS system, (as
discussed in paras 3. 10 to 3. 1 3 ofIRC:36) should also be determined. The final selection ofthe borrow
areas, whether for the body ofthe embankment or the subgrade could then be made in accordance with
the norms recommended inIRC:36 "Recommended Practice for the Constmction of Earth Embankments
for Road Surface". Great caution should be exercised to ensure and mark, as far as possible, homogenous
soils only for this purpose. Heterogeneous or variable soils should be avoided. In making the selection it
should be ensured that the best available homogeneous, soil is reserved for use in the subgrade (i.e., top
500 mm portion of the embankment). After completing the analysis ofthe results, borrow area charts
similar to the sample shown in
Fig. 1 3. 1 should be prepared.

13.4.
Special Investigations for High Embankments
13.4.1. Tlie basic objective ofinvestigations in such cases is to obtain engineering data for soil and
rock necessary for a quantitative design ofembankment at the chosen sites. Generally for checking
stabi ity against slip failures, the basic properties to be investigated are shear parameters, unit weight and
moismres conditions. For safety against excessive settlement, consobdation properties are important. For
iir^ estigations in such cases, services ofspeciahsts may often be needed. Reference may also be made to
IRC publication 'Guidelines for the Design ofHigh Embankinents" (IRC:75).
In addition to the above, some special considerations required have been enumerated in
Appendix-1 to this manual for locating roads in hilly areas, desert areas, water-logged areas and areas
subject to soil erosion. Thesepointsmay bekeptin view.
IRC Special Report No. 13 State of Art
: High Embankment on Soft Ground Part-A- Stage
Constructior Contains recommendations for foundations for high Embankments. Special Report 14 entitled
Stdle of die Alt High Embankments on Soft Ground- Part-B- Ground Improvement. The points mentioned
in them v/ould be ofhelp in preparation ofprojects in similar situations. Software HED Version 1 .0 (available
with the IRC) for design ofhigh embankment is recommended for analysis. Slope stability analysis for
seismic forces and reinforcement force can be handled by this software. This software is with Graphic
Capability
List oflaboratory tests to be conducted for highway embankment is placed as Appendix-1 0.
Ministr>' ofRoad Transport and Highways circular No. NH-VI-50(2 1 )/79 dated 25th January,
1 980 regarding "Investigation and Design forHigh Embankments at Approaches to Bridges and Overbridges
on National Highways and other Centrally Financed Roads" has been printed with
1 7 Annexures in
Addendum to Ministry's Technical Circulars and Directives on National Highways and Centrally Sponsored
Road and Bridge Projects published by IRC. This circular is very exhaustive and covers basic steps and
procedures for soil investigation, typical woriced out example for stability analysis ofembankments, filter
design, settlement analysis, etc.
13.5.
Soil Investigations for Cut Sections
1 3 . 5 . 1
. In the same manner as described in para 1 3 .4 for embankmerit material, soil in cut sections
along the centre line ofthe road at an elevation corresponding to the design subgrade level should be tested
for the following general properties:
(i)
Gradation
(ii)
Atterberg limits
(iii)
Field density and moisture content
(iv)
Proctor density
13.5.2. In the case of rock cuts where necessary, trial pits or boreholes should be made to
the foundation level, to make realistic estimates ofthe type ofcutting involved The interval of trial
bores may be 30 to 50 metres or as otherwise decided by the Engineer-in-charge depending on specific
requirements.
13.6.
Special Investigations in Landslide-Prone Areas
13.6.1. Information collected during preliminary survey (see pai i: 8. 1 .2) would normally identify
the landslide prone ai-eas along the alignment and every eftbrt would have been made to avoid these while
36

IRC:SP: 19-2001
fixing the centre line ofroad. However, in case where the same is not feasible, further investigations would
be required to study the extent ofthe problem and plan appropriate remedial measures. For this purpose,
services ofgeologist or soil specialist may often be needed.
13.6.2. Depending on the geological configuration and drainage ofthe area, slides may take the
form ofrock or soil fall (i.e., movement ofdetached rock fragments at steep angles), rock flows (i.e., soil
or rock mass suddenly losing strength and flowing like a liquid), or rotational slides (i.e., slips triggered
under-cutting, erosion, extemal load on upper parts ofthe slope, or water seepage), hivestigaiion in each
case will, therefore, depend on site conditions and the type of slide expected. Tliese will involve collection
ofinformation about the existing slides, sources ofwater in the area, substrata profile, arid other pertinent
data which may facilitate inferences being drawn as to the cause, mechanism, and potentiality of slides.
For detailed guidance in regard to such investigation, reference might be made to standard publications on
the subject and IRC Special Report No. 1 5 - "State ofthe Art: Landslide Correction Techniques".
13.7.
Detailed Investigation for Flexible Pavement Design
13.7.1. New flexible pavements are to be designed in accordance with IRC:37 "Guidelines for
the Design ofFlexible Pavemente". General principles laid down in this publication for moulding and testing
soil specimens under different situations to be able to use the CBR method ofdesign should be kept in
view.
13.7.2. Fornewroads, the soil data already collected in earher phases ofthe survey should be
studied in detail for ascertaining the variability/homogeneity ofthe soil profile, and planning further
investigations. Where pavement design relates to widening/strengthening ofan existing road, the road
should be divided into more or less identical sections on the basis ofactual performance and pavement
composition, as the basis for further testing.
13.7.3. For pavement design, apart from the general soil tests referred to earlier, CBR test
should be conducted for soaked, unsoakedothoth these conditions depending on the design reciuirements
spelt out in IRC:37.
Frequency ofCBR testing may be decided based on the soil classification tests conducted at
close interval of500 m-1 ,000 m.
Overall objective should be to get strength results for all changes in soil type or each demarcated
section ofsimilar performance.
1 3 . 7 .4 . A suggested proforma for presenting soil investigation data pertinent to flexible pavement
design is given in Table 13.2.
1 3.7.5. In case ofoverlay design, IRC Publication "Tentative Guidelines for Strengthening of
Flexible Pavements Using Benkelman Beam Deflection Technique-LRCiS 1 " may be followed. A suggested
proforma for Pavement Deflection Data Using Benkelman Beam attached in this chapter may be found useful.

should be carried out with 75 cm diameter plate at the rate of generally, one test per km per lane unless
foundation changes warrant additional tests. Further guidance in this respect can be had from IRC:58
"Guidelines for the Design ofRigid Pavements for Highways".
13.8.2. For investigations in connection with the strengthening ofexisting rigid pavements, reference
may be made to the IRC Special Publication 1 7 "Recommendations About Overlays on Cement Concrete
Pavements".
13.9.
Naturally Occurring Aggregates for Pavement Courses
13.9.1. The survey for naturally occurring materials, like, stone aggregates, murum, gravel, kankar,
etc., to be employed in construction should embrace the identification of suitable quarries for these, the
amount of material likely to be available from each, and the determination of physical and strength
characteristics, ofthe materials. The tests to be conducted and sample proforma for presenting the test
results are shown in Tables 13.3 and 13.4, Table 13.3 is for aggregates while Table 13.4 is for naturally
occurring materials, like, murum, gravel and soil-gravel/murum mixtures. For every quarry source, at least
three specimens should be tested for each type ofmaterial met with. Samples for the tests should be
representative and collected in accordance with the procedure setforth in IS:2430. Quarry charts showing
the location ofquames and the average lead ofmaterials should also be prepared.
New road construction as well as essential maintenance and rehabilitation ofexisting network use
substantial quantity ofmaterial resources, like, earth, stone metal, chips, binder, etc. On one hand material
extraction, processing and production invariably have adverse impact on environmental and also leads to
progressive depletion ofexisting resources. On the other hand there are many heavy industries, like, steel
plants, power plants, etc. which produce a large quantity ofwaste materials, like, slag, fly ash, bottom ash,
etc. which pile up in the absence of satisfactory disposal constituting an environmental hazard. Road
research has shown that these waste materials, like, slag, fly ash, etc. can be gam fully utilised in various
ways in construction of embankment, pavement, etc. which will not only be economical in certain areas
but also will solve the disposal problem. Keeping in mind the environmental need and over-all economy in
use ofmaterial resources, project preparation should aini al maximum utilisatic i ^ ofthese substitute materials
in the construction process.
13.10.
Manufactured Aggregates (Brick Aggregate)
13.10.1. Where the use ofbrick aggregates
i s envisaged, a survey should be made to identify the
location and average lead from the work site ofexisting kikis capable ofproducing overbuml bricks/'brick
bats. Where suitable kilns are not in operation, the survey should indicate the possibility ofopening new
kihis for the purpose.
13.11.
Manufactured Items
13.1 1.1
. For manufactured items, like
lime, cement, steel and bitumen, information about
their sources of supply arid the distance of the nearest rail-head from the location of works should
be gathered during the survey. For lime, in addition to source and lead, the infomiation should cover its
purity.
13 .12. W iter for Corsstniction Fijrposes
13.12.1. Information sJiouid also be gathered about the availability of water near the work site
and its suiiabilit>' in conformity with 18:456 fcr c.onstniclion purposes

14. ROAD INVENTORY AND CONDITION SURVEY
14.1.
Many highway projects involve improvement to an existing road (strengthening/widening)
or construction ofnew facilities (bypasses) which are an improvement in traffic conditions overthe existing
facility. In all these cases, the scope ofthe improvement measures and economic justification for them
depends upon the condition of the existing road.
It therefore, becomes necessary to prepare a road
inventory and carryout condition survey.
Suggested formats are indicated in the Appendix-7.
14.2. In some Highway Department/Public Works Department, systematic data on roads and
bridges is maintained and updated periodically. They are known as Road Registers and Bridge Registers.
For national highways and many state highways there is an existing system ofinventorisation. Wherever
available these data may be consulted and made use of
14.3. The best way ofpreservation ofcollected data is to keep them in a computer based road
data bank. With the proliferation and increasing use ofcomputers ofdifferent denominations in engineering
works, this may soon become the usual method. With this expectation in yiew inAppendix-8 is placed a
briefnote on introduction ofcomputer based road data bank.
14.4. In case the above sources are not available, a fi"esh road inventory shall have to be prepared.
The scope ofthe inventory would depend upon the nature ofthe improvements proposed. Condition
survey or riding quality will, howeverbe required even ifinventory data is available. For economic analysis,
the major road characteristics needed are:
\
For pavement strengthening proj ects, information on the subgrade soil strength and pavement
thickness and composition are needed. Deflection characteristics (by Benkebnan Beam or other Instruments)
are also required.
The riding quality is measured by a bump integrator or roughometer. The pavement width is easily
measured. The vertical profile and horizontal curvature are measured quickly by car-mounted instruments
/ or can be evaluated from topographical survey. In case the roughometers are not available, the riding
quality or the roughness in term ofIntemational Roughness Index (IRI) can be reasonably estimated by
subj ective evaluation base on World Bank Technical Paper Number 46. The guidelines for such roughness
assessment are given in Figs. 14.1 and 14.2.
For correlation with 5^ Wheel Bump Integrator values the following relation as given in HDM-in

IS. DRAINAGE STUDIES
^
15.1.
General
15.1.1. Drainage ofhighway refers to the satisfactory disposal ofsurplus waterwithin the highway
limits. The water involved may be precipitation falling on the road, surface runofiFform the adjacent land,
seepage water moving through sub-terranean channels, or moisture rising by capillary action. Adequate
information about drainage patterns is necessary to devise an effective drainage system, which brings into
focus the need for requisite studies and investigations.
1 5 . 1 .2. Drainage studies have the following principal objectives:
(i)
fixing the grade line of the road
(ii)
design of pavement, and
(iii)
design of the surface/sub-surface drainage system
^
15.1.3. Main components ofthe drainage investigation are determination of HFL and ponded
water level, depth ofwater table, range oftidal levels and amount ofsurface runoff. Besides this, for cut
sections in rolling and hilly areas, it would be necessary to carry out special investigations for sub-temmean
flows and seepage ofirrigation water from fields situated above the road.
15.1.4. Extent of studies and the data to be collected will depend on the type and scope ofthe
project. Usually good deal ofinformation could be collected through site inspection, sinq)le measurements
and local enquiry. Most appropriate time for such enquiries is during the stage ofpreliminary survey (see
section 8) so that the information gathered can be ofuse in fixing the ahgnment and finalising the broad
strategy for improving the drainage. Detailed investigations could continue till the final location survey
when any adjustment in the light offurther data could still be made before the project in finally ready. In the
case ofcut sections, investigations for seepage and sub-terranean flows may generally have to be done
again at the stage of formation cut when new features may come to light warranting modifications in
design or the need for special measures.
15.2.
High Flood Level
15.2.1. HFL govems the grade line ofa road and its reasonably precise estimation is particularly
important. The design HFL should be based on a return period depending upon the importance ofthe
structure. Information in this regard can normally be had from the irrigation department who maintain and
analyse such data. Inspection and local enquiry can often provide very useful information, such as marks
left on trees or structures indicating themaximum flood level. HFLs so determined should also be compared
with those for the adjoining sections ofthe road or nearby railway/irrigation embankments to correct any
mistake.
15.2.2. Construction ofa highway embankment may sometime block the natural drainage paths
and cause a heading up on the water on upstream side. In finalising the HFL, due allowance for the
possible afflux in such circumstances must be made. Adequate number ofopenings shall be provided.
15.3.
Depth of Water-Table
15.3.1. Knowledge ofthe high water-table (for various retum periods) is necessary for fixing the
siibgrade level deciding the thickness ofpavement, and taking other design measures such as provision of
capillary cut-offs or interceptor drains. Depth ofwater-tabte may be measured at open wells along the
alignment or at holes specially bored for the purpose. Usually observations should be taken at intervals of
one kilometre or less, preferably at the time ofwithdrawal ofthe monsoon, when the water -table is likely
46



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
to be the highest. Ifthere is any evidence ofspring flow in the test holes, this should be carefully recorded.
The depth ofwater-table should be measured with reference to a common datum.
15.3.2. Besides high water-table it may be helpful to know the fluctuations in water-table. For this
purpose, measurements ofthe lowest water-table in the driest month should also be made.
1 5.3.3. In areas where the climate is arid and the water-table is known to be at least one metres
below the general ground level, depth ofwater table need not be measured.
1 5 .4.
Ponded Water Level
1 5 .4. 1
. In situation where water stagnates by the roadside for considerable period, e.g. ^ irrigated
fields etc., information about the level ofstanding water should also be collected and considered for design
in conjunction with HFL and water-table.
15.5.
Special Investigations for Cut-Sections
15.5.1. In cut sections in rolling or hilly terrain, the problem of seepage flows is common. The
seepage water may be due to high water-table, sub-soil water moving through sub-terranean channels
where a permeable soil layer overlies an impermeable stratum, or irrigation water in adjoining fields situated
at a higher level
. Where such conditions exist, it may be necessary to intercept the seepage flow to prevent
saturation ofthe road bed
.
1 5.5.2. Preventive measures in this regard can consist ofdeep side drains ofopen or French
type (to check sideway seepage or lower the water-table), buried transverse drafns (to cut-off the
longitudinal sub-surface flow, undemeath the pavement, especially at the transition &om cut to fill sections),
or blanket course/sub-drains below the pavement in combination with side drains (to protect the
pavement form excess hydraulic pressure).
Actual treatment
in each case will depend on factors
such as the intensity of seepage, depth ofthe permeable strata etc., for which investigations would be
required.
15.5.3. Analysis ofwater-table information (see para 14.3) in conjunction with the surface profile
will indicate the possible problematic areas as regard seepage flows. As an adjunct to this, ground within
the highway limits should be surveyed soon af^er the rainy season to visually identify the seepage zones,
normally characterised by wet areas and patches. The following detailed investigations could then be
taken up at these locations to decide the appropriate drainage measures against seepage
:
(i)
Soil profile of the area i.e. soil type and the depth of various strata.
(ii)
The head under which seepage water is flowing and its hydraulic
gradient.
This could be
measured through a series of stand pipes placed in observation holes.
(iii)
Permeability tests on strata through which the ground water
is flowing.
.
15.5.4.
It is desirable that investigations for seepage flows rnay have to be repeated during execution,
particularly at the stage offormation cut, when it may be possible to make a closer examination to locate
the seepage areas more accurately. The additional observations may warrant changes in the original
design or the need for special measures.
15.6.
Surface Run-off
1 5.6. 1
. Surface run-off to be catered for includes precipitation on the highway itselfand flow
from the adjoining areas. Run-off is ultimately led away form the highway area to the natural drainage
47



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:19-2001
channels by means ofside drains. For the design ofthese drains, the following investigations, would need
to be carried out:
i
(i)
Study of ground contours of the land adjacent to the highway for determining the catchment
y
contributing to the flow in side drains.
(ii)
Determinationofthesurfacecharacteristicsofcatchmentarea, i.e., the type of soil, vegetation,
slopes etc., and
(iii)
Study of ground contours for locating the outfall points.
1 5 .6.2.
For further guidance about the design ofsurface drainage system, reference may be
made to the "IRC Code ofPractice for Road and Airfield Drainage".
16. CROSS-DRAINAGE STRUCTURES
16.1.
For cross-drainage structures, i.e., culverts, surveys and investigations are carried out
essentially for:
>
(i)
Selection of site, and
(ii)
Collection of data for design of the structure.
16.2.
Selection of Site
1 6.2. 1
.
By and large the siting ofculverts should be guided by the geometric features ofthe road
alignment unless there are specific problems oflocation and design. Where defined channels are existing
for watercourses, the culverts may be located on that. In case ofprovision ofwaterway only for balancing
purposes along a flat featureless terrain, the spacing and location may be for achieving the best balancing
work along the design geometric alignment. Where there is a choice, the following points should be kept
inview:
(i)
The site should be on a straight reach of the stream sufficiently below bends.
(ii)
The location should be as far away from the confluence ofthe large tributaries as possible. So
as to be beyond their disturbing influence.
(iii)
The bands should be well defined.
(iv)
As far as possible the site should enable a straight alignment and a square crossing.
16.3.
Collection of Data for New Structures
16.3.1.
For designing culverts, hydrological, physical and foundation data are required to be
collected. In addition, site inspection with local enquiry and a study ofthe nearby road or railway cross-
drainage structures on the same stream or in the vicinity, will provide useful information about HFL, afflux,
tendency to scour, the probable maximum-tlischarge, the likelihood ofcollection ofbrush-wood during
floods, foundation problems, etc.
1 6.3.2.
The essential data needed for design ofnew culverts are
:
.
'
(i)
Catchment Area: Where the catchment, as seen from the topographic sheet,
is less than
about
1 .25 sq.km. in area traverse should be made along the watershed with a chain and
compass.
Where the area
is flat without defined watershed,
it would first be necessary to
conduct a local contour survey to identify the watershed before taking up the traverse
for
larger catchments, the area can be measured from the
1 :50,000 topographic maps by using a
piece of transparent square paper or planimeter.
(ii)
Cross-sections:
As a rule, for a sizeable stream, three cross-sections should be taken, one at
the selected site, one upstream and another downstream of the site, all to the horizontal scale
48



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
of not less than 1/1000 and exaggerated vertical scale of not less than 1/100. Approximate
distance upstream and downstream of the selected site where cross-sections may be taken as
shown in Table 5.
Tables

150m
From 2.5 to 10 sq.km.
300m
Over lOsq.kni.
400mto 1600m
The cross-sect
>n at the proposed site of the crossing should show levels at close intervals
and indicate ou
rops of rock, formation of poois, scourholes etc. where and existing road or
a cart-track cro
es the stream at the selected site, the cross-section should not be taken along
the centre line t
Jie road or the track as that will not represent the natural shape and size of the
channel.
Inste:
; the cross-section should b©-taken a short distance upstream or downstream.
In the case of ^
;ry small streams (Catchments of 40 hectares or less), one cross-section may
do but it shoul'i be carefully plotted so as to represent truly the normal size and shape of the
channel on a straight reach.
(iii)
The Maximum HFL: The maximum high flood level should be ascertained by intelligent local
observation, supplemented by local enquiry and marked on the cross-sections.
(iv)
Longitudinal Section: The longitudinal section should extend upstream and downstream of
the proposed site upto the cross-section mentioned in (iii) above and should show levels of
the bed, low water level and the HFL.
,i
(v)
Velocity Observation:
Attempts should be made to observe the velocity during an actual
flood, but if that flood is smaller than the maximum flood, the observed velocity should be
suitable increased. The velocity thus obtained is a good check on the accuracy of velocity
calculated theoretically.
(vi)
Trial Pits: Where rock or some firm undisturbed soil stratum is not likely to be far below the
bed of the stream, a trial pit should be dug upto the rock or firm soil. But if there is no rock or
imdisturbed firm soil close to the stream bed level, then the trial pit should be taken down
roughly up to twice the maximum depth of the existing or anticipated scour line. The location
of each trial pit should be shown in the cross-section of the proposed site. The trial pit section
should be plotted to show the kind of soils passed through. Where trial pits are not possible
because of longer depths or for other reasons, trial bores should instead be made. For very
small culverts, one trial pit will be sufficient.
16.4.
Design of Cross-drainage Structure
1 6.4. 1
. The steps involved in the design ofcross-drainage structures include:
(i)
Estimation of design discharge
(ii)
Choice of type of structure to be provided
(iii)
Determination of waterway and vent height
(iv)
Structural design of foundations, sub-structure and super-structure.
For details ofthe design procedure, reference may be made to IRC 1 3 "Guidelines for the Design
ofSmall Bridges and Culverts"
.
For design ofminor bridges, reference may be made to IRC:78 on "Foundation and Sub-structure"
and relevant MOST Standard Drawings for Super-structure.

17.2.14.
Miscellaneous items
(i)
Wayside Amenities: To increase the efficiency ofwork of truck drivers, for provision of better
comfort and hygienic conditions at rest places to make essential items needed during travel,
like, good food, first-aid, medical assistance, recreation, essential repair items for vehicles of
both truckers as well as travelling passengers and tourists rest places with wayside amenities
are required to be provided at suitable intervals. Complexes with wayside amenities for truck
drivers, cleaners and other people attached to the carrier vehicles and also complexes with
passenger oriented amenities are constructed for this purpose. These complexes also may
provide a: reasonable charges telephones, reading rooms, recreation and indoor sports rooms
in addition to rest place, toilet, refuelling and repair arrangements.
The average distance
between the complexes and their size and capacity will be determined by the intensity of the
^affic flow along the highway.
53



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 124
======================================================================
IRCSP: 19-2001
(ii)
Parking Places: Provision of adequate areas of parking spaces at suitable locations
is an
important feature of road networks, particularly in urban situations. On rural highways also,
depending upon the intensity of traffic, parking places are required to be provided in complexes
with wayside amenities for trucks as well as passenger cars and tourist vehicles. On busy
roads when vehicle break-down occurs, the immobilised vehicle needs to be pulled upon the
extreme edge of the road embankment so that it does not in any way interfere with the traffic
flow. Near fuelling stations, rest or units with other type of amenities for travellers or truckers,
there should be suitable lay-bys adjacent to the highway.
(iii)
Traffic and Traffic Safety: The number of accidents occurring on our roads and the number
of lives lost in road accidents
is one of the highest in the world.
Consequently, the total
economic loss to the country is huge even excluding the cost of delay, pain, deprivation and
suffering, etc. for which it is difficult to make economic evaluation. Pursuant to the national
targets for reduction in accidents and fatalities,
it is necessary to make provisions for traffic
safety in the design and estimates of the project.
It
is commonly said that traffic safety
is dependant on provision of three E's,
i.e..
Engineering, Enforcement and Education.
In the project preparation stage care can be taken
only on the engineering aspect. Geometric and structural provisions in the project should,
therefore, conform to the engineering standards and elements essential for the design speed,
capacity,
etc. of the concerned project.
Since pedestrians and cyclists constitute a large
percentage of the
fatalities, specially on urban roads, adequate safety provisions,
like,
segregation, provision of side-walks, footpaths, cycle tracks, crossing facility at intersection,
proper lighting, etc. where relevant, shall, have to be provided.
The MORT&H has published a " Manual for Safety in Road Design - A Guide for Highway
Engineers", the suggestions of which should be kept in view during project preparation.
Also, no compromise or comer-cutting shall be allowed on provision of adequate road signs,
road marking and use of other suitable traffic safety aids.
Safety Audit: Depending upon the importance of the project, where considered necessary,
arrangement for competent safety audit on the design and engineering provisions may be
made for experts advice by some eminent consultant or professional organisations.
Toll Plazas: For collection of tolls or fees for using a particular highway facility
it is often
necessary to construct suitable toll plazas on the highways. The location, construction and
operation of the plazas should be such that
it does not substantially impede the traffic flow,
takes the least amount of time in collecting the toll and in every possible way be efficient and
convenient to the road user.
For construction of toll plazas on National Highways, the Ministry of Surface Transport
has from time to time circulated several guidelines, the most well known of which are those
under Ministry's letter No.33054/7/88-S&Rdt. 4-1 1-92. The circular contains general guidelines
for planning, construction and operation ofmodem toll plazas on National Highways including
procedural details for selection of an appropriate design, layout, construction keeping in view
traffic, terrain and type of operating system desired (manual, semi-automatic) and the likely
period for collection of toll.
(vi)
Dumping Grounds: One of the essential requirement of road planning and design is to make
proper provision for utilisation of unwanted surplus materials resulting from construction
excavations in earth work and rock, etc. are normally tried to be adjusted between cut and fill
sections or utilisation low level areas within reasonable leads. Where no such thing is possible
or if the surplus material is of unwanted nature (like, dismantled old road crust, elements of
dismantled structures, stumps and root system for trees, rejected bituminous mixes, etc.) these
require to be dumped in specially earmarked places.
Depending upon the requirement of
space suitable fallow land or naturally depressed low lands in need of filling may be identified
within easy and economic leads for dumping of such materials. The project estunate may make
suitable provisions for such arrangement.

Estimate
17.3.1.
The project estimate should give a clear picture ofthe financial commitment involved
and should be realistic. This is possible only ifthe items ofwork are carefully listed, the quantities determined
to a reasonable degree ofaccuracy, and the rates provided on a realistic basis.

The estimate should consist of;
(i)
General abstract of cost: This should give the total cost ofthe scheme with a general break-
up under major heads (with further
sub-divisions as necessary), e.g., land acquisition; site
clearance, earthwork, sub-bases and bases, bituminous work/cement concrete pavement; cross-
drainage and other miscellaneous structures; miscellaneous items, percentage charges for
contingencies, work-charged establishment, quality control, etc. The General Abstract
of
cost should also include the cost of shifting utilities, like, electric lines, telephone poles,
underground cables, gas lines, sewers, water pipes, cost of arboriculture, cost of removal of
trees and compensatory
afforestation.

Drawings
1 7.4. 1
.
General: Project drawings should depict the proposed works in relation to the existing
features, besides other information necessary for easy and accurate translation ofthe proposals in the
fields. For easy understanding and interpretation, it is desirable that the drawings should follow a uniform
practice with regard to size, scales, and the details to be incorporated.
1 7.4.2.
Drawing size: Drawings should be adequate size to accommodate a reasonable length
ofthe road or a structural unit in full details. At the same time, these should not be inconveniently large to
55

necessitate several folds. From this angle, it is recommended that preferably the size may be 594x420
mm or 420x297 mm corresponding to A2, A3 respectively, as per IS : 696 - 1 960. Drawings ofthis size
could be stitched in a folder with flexible covers so that the folio can be rolled for convenient handling. On
sheet ofA2 size, it will be possible to accommodate the plan and L-section ofone km length ofthe road,
with sufficient overlap on either side and on sheet ofA3 size, it will be possible to accommodate the plan
and L-section of750m length ofthe road,with sufficient overlap on either side, ifdrawn to the horizontal
scale of 1 :2500. A wider margin of40mm may be kept on the left hand side ofthe drawing to i&cilitate
stitching into a folio.
1 7.4.3, Component parts ofhighway project drawings: The drawings usually required for a
road project include the following:
(i)
Locality map-cum-sste plan: This is combination ofa key map and index map drawn on a single
sheet.
This will be the first sheet in folio of drawings for a particular section of the road.
However, where the length ofa section is substantial, it may become necessary to separate out
the locality map and the site plan. The former being accommodated in one sheet and the latter
on a series of sheets.
The locality map (same as key map) should show the location of the road with respect to
important towns and industrial centres and the existing means of communication' in the
neighbourhood so as to give a bird's eyeview of the proposed work. The map may be to a
scale of 1 :250,000 which is one of the common scales used in Survey of India maps.
The site plan (same as index map) should show the project road and
its immediate
neighbourhood covering the important physical features, such as, hills, rivers, tanks, railway
lines, etc.
It may be to a scale of 1 :50,000 and should show the, kilometres from the beginning
to end.
The sheet containing the locality map-cum-site plan should have a legend to explain the
abbreviations and symbols used in subsequent drawing sheets.
One typical example of locality map-cum-site plan may be seen in Plate-1.
(ii)
Lland Acquisition Plans: These should be prepared on existing village maps or settlement
maps giving the details ofproperty boundaries and their survey numbers. A scale in the range
of 1 :2000 to
1 :8000 depending on available maps will be suitable. If for any reason detailed land
acquisition plans are not possible, rough plans should be prepared.
Inter alia, the plans
should show the final centreline of the road; and right-of-way boundaries, buildings, wells,
—
monuments, trees, etc. affected by the road alignment, type of land, i.e., irrigated, wet, dry,
barren,
forest, etc. and the nature of crops.
(iii)
Plan and longitudinal section: Plan and longitudinal section for one km length of the road
should be shown on a single drawing sheet as far as possible the plan should be at the top and
the longitudinal section at the bottom. Common scale adopted is
1 :2500 for the horizontal, and
1 :250 for the vertical, but this may be changed suitably for hilly stretches (also see para 8.3)
The plan, among other things, should show the
final centreline of the road, right-of-way
limits, roadway of the existing road where applicable, existing structures, drainage, courses,
intersecting roads, railway lines, electric and telephone lines, cables, location of cross drainage
structures, design details of horizontal curves, bench marks, position of POTs, location of
cross sections, contours, north point, etc.
The longitudinal section should show the profiles ofthe proposed road, the general ground,
and the existing road where applicable.
In addition,
it should show details, such as, the
gradients, location and set out data for vertical curves, super-elevation, details of horizontal
alignment, the design HFL, location of drainage crossings and intersecting roads, pavement
design features, continuous chainage, etc.

IRCSP: 19-2001
The manner of presenting the details on the plan and longitudinal section drawings
is
illustrated in Plate-2 for 2-lane and in Plates-5 & 6 for 4-lane divided carriageway.
(iv)
Typical cross-section sheet: In a highway project, cross-section elements, like, width of the
carriageway and roadway, side slopes, and pavements cross fall will generally remain constant
for most of the road length. Instead of repeating these details on every cross-section, it would
be desirable to show these on a typical cross-section sheet. The number of typical cross-
sections to be drawn will depend on the type of project, the terrain traversed, etc. Generahy,
it may be necessary to show
at least one cross-section each for road in fill, cut and curve.
Sample of a typical cross-section sheet may be seen in Plate-3 for 2-lane and Plate-7 for
4-lane divided carriageway.
These should be drawn to a scale of 1
: 1 00.
(v)
Detailed cross-sections: A few detailed c^oss-sections may be presented serially along the
continuous chainage.
These should show the ground levels, existing road levels where
applicable, and the proposed road levels.
The area of cut and/or
fill involved should be
indicated as also the type and thickness of the different pavement courses. For rest of the
cross-sections computer charts showing tabulated level details and distances may be
appended.
The recommended manner of presenting the cross-sections is illustrated
in Plate-4.
(vi)
Drawings for cross-drainage structures: In a highway project, a large number ofsmall cross-
drainage structures,
(i.e., culverts)
will be required to be constructed.
Unless, there
is a
special problem,
it should normally be convenient to adopt standard designs for these.
If a
standard design is not used for any reason, a separate drawing should be prepared for each
cross-drainage structure. A convenient scale
is 1:50.
For the details
to be shown on these drawings, reference may be made to IRC:SP-13
"Guidelines for Design or Small Bridges and Culverts".
(vii)
Road
junction drawings: The junction drawings should show the existing features of the
intersecting roads, the proposed improvements, and traffic control devices, like, signs, pavement
marking, etc. A scale of 1:500 or 1:600 will be found convenient for this purpose. Atypical
drawing is shown in Plate-8 for illustration.
(viii)
Drawings for retaining walls and other structures: These drawings should clearly show the
foundation and structural details as also the materials proposed to be used. The scale chosen
J
should be large enough to show all the details comprehensively.
(ix)
Drawings ofwayside amenities.
'
(x)
Location of various road signs.
17.5.
Check List
Appendix-4 gives a check list for the various surveys and investigation work involved in the
preparation ofa road project. The various items that should be incorporated in a detailed Project Report
are shown in the form of a check list mAppendix-9 for guidance. This is intended to serve in a ready
reference to ensure that all the items have been included and give ^in opportunity to the engineer preparing
the project to review his work and ifnecessary to state in the reports why some items have been left out.

Appendix-1
GUIDING PRINCIPLES COVERING ROUTE SELECTION
AND HIGHWAY LOCATION
1.
General
1.1. The highway should be as direct as possible between the cities or towns to be linked, thereby, satisfying
the major desired linlcs. A direct highway link results in economy in construction, maintenance and operation.
1 .2. The location should result in minimum interference to agriculture and industry.
1.3. The location should, as far as possible, facilitate easy grades and curvature.
1 .4.
The location should steer clear of obstruction, such as, cemetries, burning ghats, places of worship,
archaeological and historical monuments, and as far as possible, from public facilities, like, hospitals, schools, play
grounds, etc.
1.5. Where the proposed location interferes with utility, services, like, overhead transmission lines.
Water
supply lin^s, etc., decision between changing the highway alignment or shifting the utility services should be based on
study of the relative economics and feasibility.
1.6. As far as possible, frequent crossing and re-crossing of a railway line should be avoided.
For design
requirements in such cases, reference may be made to IRC:39 "Standards for Road-Rail Level Crossings".
1.7. An important obligatory point in the selection of the route
is the location of river crossings.
While
crossings of major rivers (waterway exceeding 200 m.) may have to be as normal to the river flow if possible, with
highway alignment sub-ordinated to considerations of the bridge siting. Crossings of medium/minor streams should be
generally governed by the requirements of the highway proper.
If necessary, such structures could be made
skew/
located on curves.
1 .8.
The location should be such that the highway is fully integrated with the surrounding landscape of the
area.
In this connection,
it would be necessary to study the environmental impact of the highway and ensure that the
adverse effects of it are kept to the minimum.
. -
,
1.9.
The highway should, as far as possible, be located along edges of properties rather than through their
middle so as to cause least interference to cultivation and other activities and to avoid the need for frequent crossing of
the highway by the local people.
1.10.
The location should
be, such as, to avoid unnecessary and expensive destruction of wooded areas.
Where intrusion into such areas is unavoidable the highway should be aligned on a curve if possible so as to preserve
an unbroken background.
1.11. The location should, as far as possible, be close to sources of embankment axid pavement materials so
that haulage of these over long distances is avoided and the cost minimised.
1.12. A preferred location is one which passes through areas having better type of soil and permits a balancing
of the cost of cut and fill for the formation.
1.13. Marshy and low-lying land, and areas having poor drainage and very poor embankment material should
be avoided, as far as possible.
Also, areas susceptible to subsidence due to mining operations should be by-passed.
L l4.
Areas liable to flooding should be avoided, as far as possible.
1.15. Highways through villages and towns increase traffic hazards and cause delay and congestion. Wherever
a serious problem of this nature is encountered it may be advisable to by-pass the built-up area playing well clear of the
limits upto which the town or village is anticipated to grow in the future.
1.16.
As far as possible, areas likely to be unstable due to toe-erosion by rivers, shall be avoided.
58



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 124
======================================================================
IRC.SP: 19-2001
1.17. During fixing of alignment by the side of a river, the direction of flow of the river and HFL records for past
50 years shall be kept in view.
1.18. In spite of all conscious effort to avoid running through forest areas many times roads are required to be
aligned passing through the forest land. With increase in traffic roads require to be widened often leading to cutting of
ti-ees on one or both sides ofthe road. All these unavoidable feeling need to be made good by provision ofcompensatory
afforestation in equal or additional areas at suitable locations. Project preparation needs to keep this aspect in view and
make necessary provisions for compensatory afforestation where the same is warranted.
1.19.
Ifprior to project preparation it is known that a facility under construction is to be widened to additional
lanes, the project should be prepared by locating the first embankment and pavement in an eccentric position with
respect to the total land available and also freeze the total land required for the entire envisaged facility right in the
beginning. The subsequent construction may then be undertaken symmetrically with respect to the centre line of the
land.
If provision of additional lanes has to be made to an old road,
it can be done either by addition of half the
requirement symmetrically on each side on the entire new addition on one side only. The points to be considered in such
a case are:
(i)
the availability of land and convenience of additional acquisition in view ofpresence ofbuildings and
existing constructions on each side
(ii)
felling of trees that may be involved on either side
(iii)
the width of new construction and facility of compaction equipment to operate and
(iv)
technical convenience for construction of additional structures and necessary protection works for
the same in the vicinity of the existing structures
(v)
Technical convenience for locations of additional two-lane carriageway proferably on up stream side
of the flow of water, providing better protection to the existing facility.
2.
Special Problems ofLocating in Hilly Areas
2.1. The route should enable the ruling gradient to be attained in most of the length.
2.2.
Steep
terrain and other inaccessible area should be avoided, as far as possible.
2.3.
Unstable hilly features, areas having frequent landslide or settlement problems and up slope benched
agricultural field with potential for standing water may be avoided as far as possible.
2.4.
Locations, along a river valley have the inherent advantage of comparatively gentle gradients, proximity
of inhabited villages, and easy supply of water for construction purposes.
However, this solution
is be-set with
disadvantages, such as, the need for large number of cross-drainage structures and protective works against erosion.
It
would, therefore, be necessary to take the various aspects into account before making the final selection.
2.5. The alignment should involve least number of hair-pin bends. Where unavoidable, the bends should be
located on stable and gentle hill slopes.
2.6.
In certain cases, it may be expedient to negotiate high mountain ranges through tunnels. For such cases,
the decision should be based on relative economics or strategic considerations.
2.7.
In crossing mountain ridges, the location should be such that the highway preferably crosses the ridge at
their lowest elevation.
2.8. An alignment likely to receive plenty ofsunlight should receive due preference over the one which will be
in shade.
2.9.
Areas liable to snow drift should be avoided.
2.10. As far as possible, needless rise and fall must be avoided, specially where the general purpose of the
route is to gain elevation from a lower point to a higher point.

Special consideration for locating roads in desert area
3.1. Locations where sand
is loose and unstable should be avoided and the alignment selected along ridges
having vegetation.
3.2. Preference should be given to areas having coarse sand than to areas having fine wind blown sand.
3 .3 . In locating a road in an area having longitudinal sand dunes, the best location is always at the top ofa ridge
or in the inter-dunal space. Location along the face of longitudinal dunes should be avoided.
3.4. The alignment of road should as far as possible run parallel to sand dunes, sand dunes should be crossed
without disturbing their existing profile.
4.
Special Considerations in Expansive Soils
4. 1 .
Suitable forms of stabilisation, specially mixing of lime in pulverised soil may be necessary to achieve
desired gain in strength.
5.
Special Considerations ofRoad in Saline Soils
5.1.
Locations where large salt deposits occur should be bypassed.
5 .2 . In locating the road in medium and highly saline soil precautions for diversion ofwater away from road bed
should be taken.
5.3. On wet saline soils, highway embankment should be constructed ofgood in^rted soil free from salts.
6.
Special Consideration in Marine Clay
In case the marine clay site is under the influence oftide rise and fall ofwater, the subgrade should be 1 .0 meter
above the highest tidal water level.
Marine clay are soft and compressible. Therefore, stability of fill and the magnitude and time rate of settlemeiit
needs to be evaluated and considered. Ifthese factors are not within the acceptable limit ground in^rovements methods
may be adopted.
7.
Special Consideration in Water Logged Areas
7. 1 . Embankment height should be adequately above level of standing water.
7.2. Provision of capillary cut-off or blanket drainage facility below pavement may be necessary.
8.
Points ofGuidance on Prevention of Soil Erosion needing attention in the Construction ofRoad in Hilly
Areas:
8.1. The road construction project estimates should provide for not only the requisite scale ofinvestigation but
also the necessary measures against soil erosion so that these can be built into the project with adequate financial
provision.
8.2. Before fmalising the alignment erosion potential of each altemative should be carefully examined and the
one involving least disturbance to the natural ground should be preferred.
8.3. Roads should not be located in geological by unstable strata, if this can be avoided. Study ot the geological
maps of the area and consultation with the local Geological Department will be helpful in this regard.
8.4. Road alignment should avoid large scale cutting and filling and follow the profile of the land as far as
possible. Use of tunnels to avoid deep cuts should be considered where feasible and economical.
8.5. To the extent feasible, roads should be aligned away from streams except where these are to be crossed,
since the greatest damage aways occur along water courses. Special attention is necessary to create protective belts of
forests on both sides.
8.6. It will be advisable, at least for important roads, to have consultation with officers ofForest Department at
the stages of route alignment selection, surveys and investigations, etc., so as to ensure that the selected alignment has

mnimUm potential for soil erosion and that the project designs and estimates provide for the necessary soils erosion
ontrol measures.
8.7. On hill Slopes half cut and half fill type of cross-section which involves least disturbance to the natural
ground, should be adopted subject to^ consideration of economy and road stability being satisfied.
8.8.
The cut slope should be
made stable for the type of strata in the initial construction stage itself by
resortiAg to stable cut slopes with benches, etc., including the use of slope stabilising structures, like, breast walls,
pitching, etc.
8.9.
Area for clearing and grubbing should be kept minimum subject to technical requirements ofthe road. The
clearing area should be pro'^erly demarcated to save desirable trees and shrubs and to prevent overclearing.
8.10. Location and aligment of culverts should be so chosen as to avoid adverse erosion at outlets and siltation
at inlets.
8.11. The cross-drainage structures should discharge safely on the valley side and in this connection all
necessary precautions/safe guards should be taken to ensure that the discharging water does not cause erosion even
when they flow for long period.
8.12. Drainage of water from the roadside must be given top attention and necessary system of drains will be
received to deal the run-off to natural water courses.
8.13. Appropriate mitigating Pleasures, like, ground cover planting and compulsory afforestation may be catered

TRAFFIC GROWTH RATE ESTIMATION
1.1.
Traffic growth rate is required to be estimated to assess the future corridor traffic. To be realistic, this
projection must be made by considering traffic flow pattern by Origin-Destination pairs and changes in vehicle mix
expected during the time horizon of the study. Since the transport demand can change due to shift in the pattern of
economic activities, it is also necessary to consider trip generation potentials within a region. In view of this, projecting
regional socio-economic characteristics, plus the rate ofchange likely to take place in the economy, the population size,
urbanisation and the spatial distribution of the economic activities are required to be considered in estimation of growth
rate for traffic projection. Simple methods which may be considred suitable are described below:
1 .2. Time Trend Analysis
For this purpose classified volume count data are to be collected at selected survey location which are reasonably
representative of the traffic flow conditions along the corridor.
2
The analysis is then carried out generally by Linear Regression Analysis. A R
value of 0.75 or more would be
acceptable for forecasting. Erratic and scattered values of R may require considei^tion of other
parameteres and
appropriate unbiased purification of data base or adjustment of growth rates. Nevertheless, this method has its limitations
particularly in its applications to a new facility. Secondly, historical growth rates do not cover the changes in the socio-
economic structure, as such,
fail to reflect fully the prospective growth envisaged in the economy and the spatial
distribution of economic activities, population size and, urbanization. These may require to have some zonal-level
forecasting along the corridor. Thus, something more than simple extrapolation of historical growth rates by vehicle type
is required.
1 .3. Systematic Forecasting Method
This method is more related to the projections of Origin-Destination linkages at the zonal-level, as related to the
prospective growth in population and the economy.
The traffic forecasting models developed for the study involve the estimation of future transport demand, in
terms of future growth rates based on the growth of population and State Domestic Project (SDP), together with the
elasticity of transport demand for both passengers and freight, in relation to income and population.
The data inputs required by this method for the determination of growth rates of vehicular traffic comprise:
(a)
the growth of population
(b)
income (in real terms) and
(c)
the elasticity of transport demand in relation to population and income
The data, particularly the income and transport demand elasticity, are generally not available at zonal level, the
state level data may be used with due consideration of the zone under consideration.
1.4. Simplifled Approach
This appoach
is primarily based on the broad guidelines for economic analysis for highway investments
circulated for schemes under the proposed assistance by the Asian Development Bank.
Forecast future normal demand for transport by project road based on, but not necessary limited to, annual
population and real income per capita growth rates (in per cent per year) estimated in Road Influence Area (RIA), elasticy
of transport demand in relation to income, and estimated annual production increases (in per cent per year) in RIA. In
other words, annual traffic growth must be related to specific economic activity in each RIA. Transport demand should
be projected on an annual basis over the project period. The fomulae for aimual growth (in per cent) of passenger
vehicles and trucks may be assumed as follows:
(a) Passenger Vehicles
Example: Assumptions
(i)
Population grov^: 2. 1 per cent a year during 1 98 1 -9 1 (expected population growth
rates during 1991-2001 2 per cent per year)

2.1
Where E is the elasticity of transport demand,
(b) Freight Traffic
Estimation of freight traffic is more complex in nature and involves the process of iteration as well as subjective
decision so as to be compatible with the regional perspective plans and other indicators. The basic steps will comprise:
(i)
From socio-economic profile find out the annual weighted average growth rate in per cent in the
agricultural, industrial, mining and tourisrn sectors (assumed as the predominant sectors) from the
State Domestic Product (SDP) data base. This growth may be computed in five (5) year blocks;
(ii)
To the above growth rate, apply the elasticity of transport demand. For example
For the first five years 2.0, second five years
1 .8 and third five years
1 .6;
(lii)
Based on the above generate movement quantum in terms ofcommodity tonnage in the same block of
years;
:
(iv)
Now assume percentage of likely market shares by LCV, HCV and MAV during the project period;
(v)
Further assign lead distance to connect the commodity movement into tonne-km and using step(iv)
generate numbers of vehicles in blocks of five years;
(vi)
As a check back calculate the growth rates to examine its appropriateness in the context of regional
development perspective and other development parameters. Apply suitable corrections, on subjective
basis, to finalise the growth rates and generate annualised traffic streams in terms of LCV, HCV and
MAV for use in pavement design as well as economic analysis.
1.4. Conclusion
From the findings of the alternative methods described, appropriate growth rates may be adopted for the
project road concerned.

INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER BASED ROAD DATA BANK
1.
Introduction
The advance of personal computers desk top, lap top or palmtop has made
it possible to establish road data
banks which can be used both for macro and micro level administration of various road networks.
As far as possible all project preparation work shall be made computer oriented and the basic steps starting
from collection of data on Road Inventory, condition survey etc. shall be formulated with due consideration to the
requirement ofcomputer based Road Data Bank (RDB).
The important element in establishment of an RDB is the choice of reference system. The reference system for
the National and State Highways may be the kilometer posts. For secondary road system the same may be tied to the NH
«fe SH road networks. Hence, prior to collection of data the reference system has to be determined to suit the application
of data for easy storage and retrieval.
2.
Roleof Computer-aided Design
The rapid development of computer packages in recent years has transformed the highway and junction
design process. No longer do large numbers of repetitive calculations have to be laboriously carried out by hand.
Instead increasingly powerful and compact computers, together with increasingly sophisticated and commercially
available software packages, which now include computer graphics, make it possible to investigate a greater number of
design options, and to undertake the necessary design calculations more reliably and in a much shorter period of time.
Furthermore, the development ofcomputer graphics programs can be of considerable help to decision-makers
since a picture or diagram can often replace many words and numerical tables, and get over a message or impact in a
much more satisfactory and clear-cut way.
Computer-aided design (CAD) packages have a number of important roles to play.
(a)
Because they enable repetitive calculations to be carried out quickly and accurately, the designer
can investigate a wide range of possible solutions and determine their consequences.
(b)
It follows from the above that any modifications to a particular scheme involving recalculations
can also be easily and quickly carried out.
(c)
Computer package are capable of storing considerable valumes of design data. These can be
readify recalled if necessary. Furthermore, if any design modifications are carried out, the new
.
'
information goes into the memory and replaces the original information. Three advantages follow
from this:
(i)
the information in the memory store is always up-to-date;
(ii)
information on various aspects of a design, such
as, horizontal and vartical alignment
calculations, drainage alignment details including inlet and manhole locations, lighting column
positions, details of public utility services runs and depths are stored, and so any potential
design conflicts can be identified by retrieving and plotting from appropriate data sets (e.g.
lighting column coincident with a draignage pipe, or inadequate clearance under a bridge
after adjusting the road vertical alignment);
(iii)
all the information can be stored centially, but accessed from remote terminals, including any
on the construction site.
(d)
The visual appearance of a scheme can be determined from a wide range of viewing positions
Normally the proposed scheme
is set against the developmental background in order that an
assessment can be made of the visual impact (if any) on the local area. It is also possible to assess
the extent to which landscaping and planting will reduce the visual intrusion.
77



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 124
======================================================================
IRQSP: 19-2001
\
Many commercial design packages are now available in this country for determining the best alignment for a
length of roads.
'
3. What is CAD
\
When using any design package
it is important to realise its limitations. For example, although the computer
can carry out calculations rapidly and accurately, it can only do these in the way specified within the program. It cannot
be creative nor can
it usually take decisions except in very simple situations. What
it can do, however,
is to provide
information as an input into the decision-making process. This information will often include not only numerical
comparisons between altemative schemes, such as capital cost, but also subjective comparisons, such as the extent of
visual intrusion.
\
In all computer applications it is important to know precisely the analytical basis of the design program, and its
limitations. It should be remembered that the onus of interpreting any outj^us always lies with the designer using the
program.
When using any CAD packages it is important to ensure that all the input information is soundly based and up-
to-date. This will range from information on site conditions, such as, locations and types of property, existing accesses,
topographic information and existing road and junction layout details (since these impose possible constraints on what
proposals might be developed) to the design year trafic flow predictions. If the input data are inaccurate or unreliable,
then the outputs will also be poor, and this can lead to sub-optimal layouts being produced and adopted.
A CAD system will normally consists of the four main components as below:
(a)
Input devices
(b)
Processor
^
(c)
Datastorage
(d)
Output Devices
A single computer can either operate in isolation or be linked to other computers via a modem or the normal
telecommunications network. These linkage can be within the same office, or with outside locations. This enables
information and drawings to be transmitted quickly without the necessity of physical moving larpe amounts of paper.
4. Data Input Requirements
Highway design CAD programs and packages can be considered under two broad heading-junction design
and road alignment design. Some CAD packages deal only with one or other of the above design areas, but more
comprehensive interactive packages, embrace both.
5.
Essential Compatible Requirements
^
To utilise the speed and accuracy of any electronic data processing system through use of sophisticated
computer hardware's and software packages,
it is necessary to modernise the data capturing from field/site and down
loading the same direct to the computer. Any manual intput will slow down the process and may uivoive error. Use of
survey equipment such as Total Station, Eletronic Theodolite, Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM ), Autolevel, etc.
are a necessity of the day to expenditiously complete a road project to meet the requirements of high intemationa
quality project preparation.

(iv)
Moisture-density relationship using light/heavy compaction, commonly known as Standard/modified
proctor test (as per IS:2720 Part-VlIU 980)
On the basis of tests conducted as per (a) above, the samples may be categorised into types, each
showing the same or closely similar soil characteristics. One or two samples out of each category
may be judiciously selected so as to be representative and subjected to the following tests:
(i)
For cohesive fill material (e.g. clay or silty/sandy clay mixed with silt/sand), c and 0 miy be
determined from unconsolidated undrained (UU) triaxial test (according to IS:2720 Part-XI-
1 972) on specimens remoulded to 95% proctor density at OMC plus 2%.
(ii)
If the fill material is cohesionless, 0 may be determined from direct shear test (according to
IS:2720 Part-XIII- 1 972) on specimens remoulded to 95% proctor density at OMC.
(iii) For cohesive fill materials which may be used for forming embankments likely to be subjected
to submergence and drawdown, effective stress parameters c' and 0' as also A-factor, may be
determined from consolidated undrained test with measurement ofpore pressure i.e. CU tests
(according to IS:2720 Part-Xn-1981) on specimens remoulded to 95% proctor density at OMC
plus 2%. The test specimens in the triaxial cell need to be saturated by applying back pressure
before shearing.
This test will be in addition to that mentioned in (b) (i) above and may be
carried out for selected few representative samples only.
(iv) For any of the types of strength tests mentioned above, the actual bulk density, void ratio and
moisture content of the specimens before/after the test should be found out and recorded.

B. Coastal Regulation Zone
Coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwaters which are influenced by tidal
action (in the landward side) upto 500 meters from the High Tide Level (HTL) and the land between the
Low Tide Level and the HTL is declared as Coastal Regulation Zone.
Construction activities are prohibited in the Coastal Regulation Zone except for existing roads or those
specifically approved in the Coastal Zone Management Plan of the area categorised as CRZ II, viz., the
areas that have already -been developed upto or close to the shore line and provided inter-alia with
approach road.

BENEHOAL IMPACTS
NEGATIVE IMPACTS
Employment opportunity to people
Erosion and sediment dischage.
Enhancement of local industry, agricultureand
handicrafts
Poor drainage resulting in rail/road/highway
demage and leading to flooding problems
and degradation of water resources. Formation ofnew
gullies.
Income from visitors and taxes
Enhancement of rural development through
quick and easy transportation of building
materials
.
Increase in concentration of runoff causing surface
water pollution.
Transporting, processing and marketing
of agricultural products.
Clearing ofroadside vegetation for fire-wood,
grazing, cultivation and urbanisation.
Opening up of opportunities for new
occupations.
Increase in traffic litter, noise and dust.pollution.
