FOREWORD
Many of the old bridges constructed in the past are showing signs of
weakness and require rehabilitation.
The performance of some of the
reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges built in the last few decades has
also not been entirely satisfactory.
One of the major thrust areas in bridge
development
in
future
will be
the strengthening of weak bridges and
rehabilitation of distressed bridges. The Indian Roads Congress constituted a
Committee on Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation with a view to bringing
out guidelines on various aspects of bridge management.
Guidelines on
'Inspection and Maintenance of Bridges' (IRC:SP:35) and 'Evaluation ofLoad
Carrying Capacity of Bridges' (IRC:SP:37) finalised by the Committee have
already been published. The Committee has now finalised 'Guidelines on the
Techniques
for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges' which has
received the approval of the IRC Council for publication.
Strengthening and
rehabilitation need expert knowledge and
specialisation. These guidelines cover common procedures for assessment of
distresses in bridges, selection of techniques and materials as also approach to
remedial measures and formulation of suitable repair plans.
They also include mention of some of the State-of-the-Art techniques
for testing and repair which are yet to be adopted in India. The bibliography
at the end is also a departure from the format of normal guidelines and indicate
to the user the scope for further enquiry in the concerned areas.
Rehabilitation of bridges
is an emerging area of activity which
is
bound to gain in importance in the coming years. This publication is the first
document of its kind giving all the required information at one place. However,
it is to be looked upon as a living document of suggested good practice which
will need periodic review. Any comments or suggestions for future revision
would be appreciated.
These guidelines
fulfil a genuine need of the bridge engineering
profession in this country and I am confident that their application will help
practising engineers both in the design office and in the field in carrying out
bridge rehabilitation works effectively and efficiently.

GUIDELINES ON TECHNIQUES FOR
STRENGTHENING AND REHABILITATION OF
BRIDGES
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The Indian Roads Congress constituted a Committee on
Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation (B-10) in January, 1988 in order to
look into the various aspects, policies and guidelines for the general subject of
bridge maintenance and rehabilitation. The Committee has already finalised
"Guidelines for Inspection and Maintenance of Bridges" and "Guidelines for
Evaluation of Load Carrying Capacity of Bridges"
and
these have already
been published
as IRC:SP-35 and IRC:SP-37
respectively. The present
guidelines on 'Techniques for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges' is
the third in the line. The Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation Committee
was reconstituted in January,
1991 and the Personnel of the reconstituted
Committee are given below: (as on 31.10.92)

1 .2.
The Committee had appointed a Sub-committee for preparing
the draft of the document for the present guidelines. The Sub-committee
comprised Shri A.G. Borkar (Convenor), S/Shri P.S. Gokhale, P.Y. Manjure
and D.K. Kanhere. At the stage of finalisation Shri N.G. Thaue was also
associated. The Committee held two meetings and finalised the guidelines in
the meeting held on 7th September, 1991. The guidelines are to be looked upon
as document on suggested "good practices" and not as "mandatory
specifications". The Guidelines are meant to be a living document needing
on-going review periodically. The guidelines approved by Committee were
considered and approved by
the Bridges
Specifications and Standards
Committee in their meetings held at Jaipur on 29-1 1-91 and at New Delhi on
21/22-10-92 subject to certain modifications. Later on the modified guidelines
were approved by the Executive Committee and the Council in their meetings
held at New Delhi and Patna on 11th November, 1992 and 28th November,
1992 respectively.
1.3.
The deterioration of bridges is a world-wide phenomenon and
the causes
for
this are also well known, such
as inadequate design and
construction, overloading,lack of adequate maintenance, atmospheric effects,
unforeseen events
like abnormal
floods, earthquakes
etc., and
lack of
knowledge
of the durability and long term behaviour of structural concrete.
Increasing number of bridges in the country would require major repairs for
rehabilitation/strengthening. The problems faced are loss of traffic safety or
reduction of structural strength with the resultant necessity for load limitations
and in some cases premature bridge deterioration needing replacement. These
could be avoided if adequate funds are devoted for timely repairs.
Attention
in the next few decades, therefore, is likely to be focussed on the preservation
of integrity of large number of bridges built over the previous decades, through
systematic maintenance and timely repairs.
1 .4.
The scope of these guidelines is as under
:
(i)
Defining the general process and approach for assessment of
distresses, diagnosis of the causes, proposing remedial
measures and the corresponding methods and techniques for
the engineering operations;
(ii)
Preparation of inventory of the types of bridges and inventory
of distresses normally observed in each type of bridges;



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 132
======================================================================

(iii)
Preparation of inventory and appraisal of methods and
techniques for repairs and rehabilitation;
(iv)
Preparation of inventory and appraisal methods
for
strengthening of bridges;
(v)
General guidelines on selection of techniques and materials;
and
(vi)
Testing and evaluation of various materials,
techniques and
monitoring.
A list of areas requiring further research and development has also
been added in the end for information.
1.5.
Definitions
Though in the separate guidelines for inspection and maintenance of
bridges
the definitions of various
operations have been
given,
for the
convenience of the users the same are reproduced below
:
1.5.1 .
Maintenance
: This is defined as the work needed to preserve
the intended load carrying capacity of the bridge and ensure the continued
safety of road users.
It excludes any work leading to improvement of the
structure, whether by strengthening to carry heavier loads, by widening or by
vertical realignment of the road surface. The maintenance operations begin
with the opening of the bridge to traffic. (In fact a bridge member starts ageing
the day its concrete is poured).
It excludes repairs of any damage caused by
exceptional causes
like
landslides, earthquakes, cyclones,
fire
etc., but
it
includes preventive maintenance.
1.5.2.
Repairs and rehabilitation:
These activities also meet the
above
definition of maintenance, but are
larger
in
scope and
cost,
than
maintenance.
Rehabilitation operations aim
at restoring the bridge
to the
service level it once had and has now lost. In some cases this consists of giving
the bridge the service level which was intended, but which has never been
attained, because of the deficiencies in the original design or construction.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 132
======================================================================
4
1.5.3.
Improvements (strengthening, widening, raising, etc.):
These aim at upgrading the level of service of a structure. The basic
parameters to be taken into account in such improvements are
:
Load carrying capacity and
Geometric parameters
(width of carriageway,
footpaths,
vertical clearance etc.)
1.5.4.
Replacement or reconstruction: These works are required
to be carried out when the whole structure or atleast its major components are
required
to be replaced, being beyond
the economic
level of repairs/
rehabilitation.
1.6.
Rehabilitation or Strengthening of bridges may become
necessary under various conditions, such as
:
(i)
Ageing and weathering.
(ii)
Inadequacies
in design &
detailing and defects during
construction.
(iii)
Mishaps
and
accidents during construction
leading
to
damages to the structure.
(iv)
Change of hydraulic and live load parameters, during service.
(v)
Damages due to external causes like earthquakes, floods, fire,
etc.. and foundation
settlements.
2. BASIC APPROACH
2.1.
Introduction
The bridge structures must, during their service life, have a
specified level of safety and serviceability under the design working loads and
the anticipated conditions of use.
To achieve this purpose, a good bridge
management system
is
essential.
Management system
as well as
the
maintenance policy have been dealt with in the "Guidelines on Inspection and
Maintenance of Bridges" IRC:SP-35.
In
this Chapter,
it
is proposed
to
elaborate the same specifically for rehabilitation/strengthening of bridges.



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 132
======================================================================

2.2.
Parameters
Road networks and bridges thereon
are regarded as
permanent installations.
The bridges, however, generally deteriorate with
passage of time
and
the
society's needs and requirements
in regard
to
established road networks also change continuously.
The
former leads
to
need for rehabilitation and the latter to strengthening, widening of existing
bridges.
Regardless of whether it is a
question
of
construction
of a new
bridge (s) or the rehabilitation / strengthening of an existing bridge, the work
cannot be accomplished
satisfactorily unless
there
is
a reasonable
understanding of society's needs with respect
to bridges as well as
the
requirements, needs and changes the present and future bridge stock may
impose on the Bridge Authority. The following factors, therefore, need to be
considered
:
i)
Traffic demands,
ii)
Environmental demands and considerations,
iii)
Technical restrictions; and
iv)
Socio-economic aspects.
2.2.1
Traffic demands
: Both in developing countries and highly
developed countries, the traffic volumes and axle weights have been observed
to grow continuously, more so in developing countries. The gross weight of
vehicles and the axle loads have also had a strong upward trend during the
recent decades. As the cost of pay-load-ton transportation
falls with gross
vehicle load, the tendency
is to carry as much load as possible on a single
vehicle. The reason for increasing axle loads
is thus an economic reason.
Another important factor to be considered
in
traffic loads
is the size of
exceptionally heavy vehicles. The growth in traffic volumes and axle weights
have thus to be considered for determining the strengthening measures.
2.2.2
Environmental demands:
As
the
awareness
of environmental damages increases in the public mind, there will be more
demands from them for protection against environmental damages.
2.2.3
Technical restrictions: The more complex the design of
bridges, the more difficult it is to strengthen or rehabilitate the structure. The
higher cost related
to
repairs and
rehabilitation of such
structures can
sometimes make replacement more economical.



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 132
======================================================================
6
2.2.4
Socio-economic
aspects: These
relate
to
the continuous
changes in public values in regard to willingness to pay the additional cost for
traffic safety and serviceability.
The increased importance of strengthening and
rehabilitation
of
bridges can be characterised by -
increased loads and traffic on existing bridges,
increased
technical challenges
in
areas not yet
fully
envisaged,
increased costs due to (1) limitations of the possibilities
for
replacement, (2) technical difficulties in rehabilitation and
(3) high traffic demands,
increased maintenance owing
to
the high
cost
of
rehabilitation with both activities frustrating the demand for
unrestricted traffic flow.
2.3.
Policy for Decisions
2.3.1.
The individual decision
considerations
will vary
in
accordance
with
the
size
and
importance
of bridge in question. For
rehabilitating/strengthening major bridges,elaborate analytical techniques for
evaluation of various solutions may be applied but an ordinary rehabilitation
and strengthening work of minor bridges may be carried out in accordance with
the general principles. In all cases, however, it should be ensured that available
funds are allocated in accordance with the Authority's overall objectives and
policies. The general policy must take into account the number of parameters
already described in
para 2.2 above.
In principle,the decision
- which may
vary from no action, some degree of temporary action, full rehabilitation or
strengthening
to, a replacement
- could be reached through a cost-benefit
analysis. However, such an approach may prove to be laborious in day-to-day
operations and perhaps unjustified in majority of cases. A simple operational
and robust framework for decision making is, therefore, advisable, as given
below.
2.3.2.
The bridges may be divided into elements, with relatively
short-life-spans such as pavements, water- proofings, expansion joints, paint
etc., and the bridge elements with long-life spans such as structural elements
in bridge decks, columns,
piers, foundations
etc.
Such division between



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 132
======================================================================
7
short-life and long-life bridge elements
is useful because of the stronger
economic motivation to rehabilitate and strengthen long life elements than
short
life elements.
A division between ordinary bridges and major or
important bridges is also warranted while considering difference in technology
and economy. On traffic considerations a division between bridges on rural
roads, state highways, national highways
and
expressways
also appears
necessary.
Similarly division on
environmental considerations may also be
necessary.The general policy for rehabilitation/strengthening of bridges must,
therefore be based on the following factors
:
i)
Short life elements;
ii)
Long
life elements
- important bridges; and those on
Expressways, National Highways,
State Highways and
arterial roads.
iii)
Long life elements - other bridges;
iv)
Type of bridge viz. , ordinary, major, important
Note.
:
Important bridges shall be those bridges which are on vital
links or on links of strategic importance and all major bridges on
national highways and major arterial State Roads. This definition is
purely for the purpose of this guideline.
2.3.3.
Apart from the factors given above, the policy decisions will
have to be within certain parameters such as:
(i)
Future increase in functional demands
:
In the years to come, the road transport may have a larger share
in the freight market and demand for bigger and heavier fleets
may
also grow
for economic
reasons.The number and
frequency of exceptionally heavy vehicles may also grow.
i
(ii)
Environmental Impact
:
Certain environmental and
historic
assets may have
to be
protected.
(iii)
Technical Limitations
:
e.g. for strengthening of foundations.

Technical Approach
for Rehabilitation/Strengthening
Solutions
:
The best strategy can only be determined in the light of
(i)
thorough investigation
(ii)
diagnosis of the causes of deterioration,
faults, and
weaknesses and
(iii)
assessment of the current condition of the bridge. Wherever
possible,the root causes should be eliminated before repairs
are undertaken.
Repair and strengthening operations should
be mechanically and chemically compatible with
the
properties of the original or surrounding material and the basic
structural concept.
The various steps involved in working out a plan for rehabilitation/
strengthening could be as below
:
(a)
Evaluation of the Structure from Documented Data Base
and Inspections
These have been described in the Guidelines for Inspection
and Maintenance of Bridges (IRG
: SP-35).
(b)
Locating Damages /Defects/Distresses
The deterioration of a structure can often be found visually
through visible signs of damage. Therefore visual inspection
by an experienced engineer is a vital step in the chain of further
follow-up actions. A routine or principal inspection provides
a detailed
description of some of the damages where an
assessment of the structure may become necessary.
The use of various testing methods may become necessary to
complement
the
results of the
visual
inspection of the
structure.
Testing
techniques and equipment should be
determined relative to the extent and type of deterioration or
damage and to the importance of structure (consequences of
failure).To the extent possible, non-destructive test methods
should be used.
If necessary, the results of these tests may be



======================================================================

======================================================================
9
supplemented and/or calibrated by sampling procedures in
accordance with
the small
step
principle,
that
is, when
deficiencies are discovered from a minimum number of
specimens (a small sampling) the investigation may require a
more detailed
analysis. These procedures are standardised.
(c)
Analysis of, Causes of Damages/Defects and Distresses
The purpose of an evaluation of a distressed structure is not
only to determine the effect of damage to the structure's life
expectancy/load carrying capacity, but also, and perhaps more
importantly, a determination to the possible extent, of its cause
so as to intelligently determine an effective retrofit.
Before
repair plan is implemented, the cause of the damage has to be
removed or the repair measures have
to be designed
to
accommodate the cause and protection against
it in future.
Otherwise the risk of repetition of damage will continue to
exist.
(d)
Evaluation of Results of Structural Assessment
Data resulting from the investigation of a damaged structure
including monitoring of its distress, form the basis for the
decision as to what corrective action must be undertaken. This
depends on type and extent of the damage.
An initial concern should be as to whether or not there is a risk
of failure to the damaged structure.
If this risk is present,the
first
course of action must be to immediately provide an
adequate auxiliary support mechanism and to reduce the loads
to
remove
the
risk. Where minor damage
exists
a
determination must be made as to whether the damage is stable
or will propagate with subsequent service loading. This
is
often
a difficult and subjective assessment
made
on
the
basis of a visual examination
until
it can be verified with
calculations. The elements of time and/or the harshness of the
environment become important parameters when either the
load carrying capacity is being diminished by
deterioration
(corrosion etc.) or when the load carrying capacity has to be
increased
(increased
traffic
load).
Some evaluations will
relate to whether or not an economically effective repair plan



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 132
======================================================================
can limit or contain damage and thus can enhance the effective
life of a structure. In some instances, an evaluation will be
concerned with the degree of urgency required to implement
a repair plan because of the advanced
stage of damage.
The urgency of repairs, strengthening or replacement must be
evaluated
in a
technical
sense along with
realistic
cost
estimates so that proper priorities can be established in budget
planning.
The question of urgency must also consider an
estimation of remaining
life
expectancy.
Although
assumptions in a time dependant damage process are at best
subjective, their evaluation will make an assessment of the
degree of urgency less complex. Approximate estimations of
life expectancy are valuable where damage is related to time
dependent
deterioration,
e.g. corrosion of reinforcement.
However, because of inherent uncertainties, the estimate will
have to be presented in terms of upper and lower probability
limits.
In some cases,
it may be necessary
to evaluate
the load
carrying capacity of the bridge. Guidelines for this evaluation
have been issued separately (IRC
: SP-37). Derating and/or
regulated traffic options need also to be examined in these
cases.
e)
Design of Repairs
for Rehabilitation/Strengthening
Works
:
The most important
step
in
the design of repairs
for
rehabilitation and/or strengthening work
is a careful
assessment of the existing
structure.
The purpose of this
assessment is to identify all defects and damages, diagnose
their causes and
to evaluate the present and
likely
future
adequacy of the structure.
Generally the structural design for repairs shall conform to the
relevant IRC Codes. However, it must be recognised that the
repairs for rehabilitation/ strengthening
is a special type of
work and many a time accurate structural analysis may not be
possible both for the assessment of the existing strength as
well as for the repairs for rehabilitation/strengthening. At the



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 132
======================================================================
11
same time, the design in some cases may have to account for
effects of secondary stress and composite actions. When the
structural system
is complex
for accurate analysis,
specifications more conservative than IRC specifications may
have to be adopted. On the other hand, in certain special cases
consciously permitting overstress may become unavoidable
due to construction difficulties and thus calculated risk may
have to be considered.
The designer of the rehabilitation/
strengthening measures has, therefore, to be very judicious in
his approach.
The technique to be chosen will depend on the needs, access, duration
of lane closures for traffic, atmospheric conditions, etc..
(f)
Proposals and Estimation of Costs
:
The complexity and magnitude of the repair procedure will depend
on whether
only the cause of the damage has to be removed or
the structure must be restored to original condition or
the structure needs
to be upgraded for
its load carrying
capacity and/or for its
geometry.
There are several options to be considered in evaluation of restoration
of the functionality of a damaged structure such as:
total replacement of the structure,
a combination of partial replacement and repair based upon
the severity of damage in
localised areas of the structure,
e.g, in a multiple girder bridge only one or a few girders may
require replacement and others can be salvaged by repair
;
or
extensive
rehabilitation/strengthening
measures.
The degree of restoration will depend on whether or not it is required
to restore to the original or greater load carrying capacity.
If for
technical and/or economical reasons
it is not feasible to achieve a
complete restoration to original capacity and at the same time total



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 132
======================================================================
12
replacement is not an acceptable option, a reduction of the applied
live load becomes mandatory. (Ref. IROSP-37).
The Bridge Authority in reaching a decision as to the course of action
will have to evaluate not only the technically feasible options available,but
also the costs of each
option, time of execution,
political considerations
(economical impact on communities served by the facility), life expectancy
associated with the various options available, any historical significance of the
structure, any risks that may be involved with any changes in safety level or
reduction in load carrying capacity etc.. The rehabilitation and/or strengthening
of major bridges is a complete task requiring many a time inputs from several
specialists.
The bridge engineer,
therefore, has to consult the experts
in
different fields to work out the appropriate repair plan.
3. INVENTORY OF TYPES OF BRIDGES AND
DISTRESSES NORMALLY OBSERVED
3.1.
Introduction
The types of road bridges built in India and usual distresses observed
in each type of bridge are discussed in this Chapter. Special types of bridges
like suspension bridges, cable stayed bridges, etc. have not been considered.
3.2.
Various Types of Bridges
The following types of road bridges are known to have been built in
India
:
(i)
Masonry bridges - both in stone and bricks;
(ii)
Reinforced concrete bridges;
(iii)
Steel bridges;
(iv)
Composite construction;
(v)
Prestressed Concrete bridges; and
(vi)
Timber bridges.
These again have the following forms
(i)
Arches - in masonry and concrete; (plain & RCC)



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 132
======================================================================
13
(ii)
Steel girders with concrete deck slab;
(iii)
Reinforced concrete girders with deck slab including box
girders which could be simply
supported, continuous,
balanced cantilevered etc..
(iv)
RCC rigid frame;
(v)
Prestressed concrete
girders and deck
slab, box girders
-
simply
supported, continuous, balanced cantilevered with
suspended spans
etc..
For the purpose of avoiding
too many
ramifications,
further
sub-divisions of forms and materials are not considered.
3.3.
Normally Observed
Distresses
3.3.1.
Arch Bridges
: The most common defects noticed in such
bridges are
:
(a)
Changes in profile of the arch (any flattening of arch can
weaken the arch);
(b)
Loosening of mortar
: This could Ipe considered as ageing
effect.
(c)
Arch ring deformation
: May be due to partial failure of the
ring.
(d)
Movement of the abutment or supporting pier
:
This
is
normally followed by the arch ring deformation, hog or a sag.
(e)
Longitudinal cracks
: These could be due
to varying
subsidence along the length of the abutment or pier.
(f)
Lateral and diagonal cracks indicate a dangerous state.
(g)
Cracks between the arch ring, spandrel or parapet wall.
(h)
Old cracks no longer widening and these probably occurred
immediately after the bridge was built.



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 132
======================================================================
14
(i)
A vertical crack in the return wall
: This is generally seen at
locations where foundations on yielding soil are stepped.
(j)
Bulging of wall
: This could be due
to absence or
malfunctioning of weep holes.
3.3.2.
RCC bridges
:
The most common distresses
in R.C.C.
bridges are as follows
:
(a)
Cracking: Cracks could be of different types. The
significance of cracks depends on structure
type,location of
the crack, its origin and whether the width and length increase
with time and load. These cracks can be due to several reasons
like (1) plastic shrinkage,and plastic settlement,
(2 )drying
shrinkage, (3)settlement, (4) structural deficiency, (5) reactive
aggregates,
(6)
corrosion
of
reinforcement,
(7) Early
thermal
movement
cracks, (8) Frost damage, (9) Sulphate
attack and (10) Physical salt weathering.
Plastic shrinkage cracks occur within first few hours after initial set
due to excessive bleeding and rapid early drying and result into loss
of bond to bars and exposure of reinforcement. Thermal contraction
cracks occur within first few weeks in thick walls and slabs due to
excessive heat generation.
Drying shrinkage cracks occur in walls
and slabs and take a few weeks to years for development due to loss
of moisture. They create path of seepage and leakage. Cracks due to
corrosion in reinforcement take several months or years and lead to
rapid deterioration of concrete.
Alkali aggregate reaction can be a
cause of cracks on account of internal bursting force caused by
expansive reaction of certain aggregates
in
high
alkali content
situations while frost damage can occur at any age in porous concrete.
Cracks due to sulphate attack may take several years
to develop
mostly near or below ground level on account of sulphate salts in
damp ground reacting with
the hydrated cement constituents.
Physical salt weathering requires many months to many years for
development of cracks in the inter tidal and splash zone or just near
ground level
in desert
terrain, leading
to deposition of salts and
volume changes and final disintegration.
Plastic shrinkage and drying shrinkage cracks result into loss of bond
and could be cause of path
for seepage and leakages.
Thermal



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 132
======================================================================
15
contraction cracks could
result into exposure of
reinforcement,
seepage and
leaking. The settlement cracks due to movement must
be recorded and the cause established. Such cracks can be critical and
affect the load carrying capacity of the bridge. Structural cracks may
occur due to overstressing which in turn can be due to the overloads
or due
to under-designed members or due
to deficiency
in
construction. These cracks must be evaluated depending on
the
location,
size and apparent cause. Corrosion induced cracks are
located directly above or below the reinforcement. Rust stains may
be visible and such cracks can indicate loss of load carrying capacity
with time. Cracks caused by chemical reaction, alkali silica reaction
can lead to
serious damages to the concrete and loss of strength and
capacity.
(b)
Scaling
: Scaling is the
manifestation on the surface of loss
of concrete
in patches.
If the process continues, coarse
aggregates can
get exposed and become loose and
disintegrated and may eventually get dislodged. Kerbs and
parapet walls are particularly susceptible to scaling.
(c)
Delamination
: Delaminations are separations along a plane
parallel to the surface of the concrete. These can be caused by
corrosion of reinforcement. Bridge decks and corners of
concrete beams,caps and columns are particularly susceptible
to delamination and delaminations
ultimately can cause
spalling of concrete.
(d)
Spalling
: Spalling of concrete is generally recognised to be
a serious defect as
it can cause
local weakening, expose
reinforcement, impair riding quality of deck and with time can
cause
structural
failure.Spall
is a depression caused by
separation and removal of surface concrete. Major causes of
spalling are corrosion of the reinforcement, overstresses, etc.
(e)
Leaching
: Leaching is the accumulation of salt lime deposits
white in colour on the concrete surface. These are noticed
normally on the underside of concrete decks and along cracks
on
vertical faces of abutment walls,wing walls
etc. These
indicate porous or cracked concrete. Where salts (NaCl or
Sulphates) are present, the migration of moisture associated
with leaching may initiate severe early deterioration.



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 132
======================================================================
16
(f)
Stains
: Most significant stains
is
that due to
rust which
indicates presence of corrosion. But absence of rust is not
necessarily indicative of no corrosion.
(g)
Hollow or Dead Sound
:
If tapping
with a hammer or rod
produces
a 'dead' sound, this
is indication of low
quality
concrete or delamination.
(h)
Deformations
: These are the effects of distress which may
show in the form of deflection, spalling, delamination, scaling,
cracks etc..
Swelling or expansion of concrete is usually an
indication of reactive materials. However, localised swelling
may be caused by compressive
failure of the concrete.
Twisting of substructure or superstructure units may be
evidence of a settlement of foundation problem.
(i)
Excessive Deflections
: This could be due to deficiency in the
structural capacity of the superstructure or due to passage of
abnormal loads. Time dependent stresses also can cause such
deflections if the estimated values of creep are different from
the actual values.
(j)
Holes in Deck Slab
: This could be due to local weaknesses
in concrete or other causes.
3.3.3.
Prestressed concrete bridges
: Most of the forms of
distresses in prestressed concrete are similar to those in RCC. However, certain
special features are as under
:
(a)
Cracking
: Cracking in prestressed concrete is an indication
of a potentially serious problem. Horizontal cracks near the
ends of prestressed members may indicate a deficiency of
reinforcing
steel,
to
cater
for bursting
stresses.
Vertical
cracking
in the lower portion of the member not near the
support could be due
to
serious overstressing or
loss of
prestress. Vertical crack in the bottom of the unit and at the
support may be a result of restricted movement in bearings.
Vertical cracks in precast members above the neutral axis of
a prestressed
member can be due to mishandling during
transportation
or erection
but these cracks close when.dead
load of the deck is applied.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 132
======================================================================
17
(b)
Leaching
: Leaching is also evidenced in prestressed bridges
and the associated moisture movements will aggravate any
corrosion risk.
Particular attention needs to be paid to the
concrete or mortar adjacent to
joints in prestressed concrete
e.g. box girders.
(c)
Stains
: Rust stains in prestressed concrete indicate corrosion
of prestressing cables and should be considered a serious
threat to structural integrity of the member. No rust stain does
not necessarily mean no corrosion.
(d)
Spall in g
: Spalling in prestressed concrete is a serious problem
and can result in loss of prestress.
(e)
Excessive Deformations
:
In prestressed members,
the
abnormal deflections could also occur due to loss of prestress
with time.
(f)
Abnormal Vibrations
:
These could be due
to slender
members or combination of various reasons.
3.3.4.
Steel bridges
: The defects in steel bridges will be
:
(i)
Corrosion;
(ii)
Excessive vibrations;
(iii)
Excessive deflections and deformations
like
buckling,
kinking, warping and waving;
(iv)
Fractures;
(v)
Distresses in connections, and
(vi)
Fatigue cracking.

:

-

3.3.5.
Composite construction: The distresses are normally the
same as those for the concrete and/or steel bridges.
However
it
is usually
observed that the distresses like cracks are more common at the interface
between two materials due to horizontal shear, the shear connectors being
either absent or being of insufficient capacity.

3.3.6.
Timber bridges
: Some of the normally observed distresses
are
:
(i)
Cracking and splitting of members due to overload, ageing or
under-designing of members.
(ii)
Abnormal deflections due to overloads or under designing or
imperfect joints,
(iii)
Infestations, decay etc. , due to environmental aggressiveness.
(iv)
Looseness of joints due to lack of good workmanship.
3.3.7. Miscellaneous -.Distresses in
bearings and expansion joints
manifest themselves in
various forms and have been dealt with separately.
3.3.8.
Although the normally observed distresses have been listed
above, the bridge engineer should keep an open mind to observe any new type
of unusual distress/behaviour during inspection or monitoring.
4. TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS
(CONCRETE BRIDGES)
4.1.
Introduction
Most of the road bridges built in India in the past few decades, have
been constructed in concrete. Similarly, in the next few decades also, concrete
will continue
to be
the main
material
for bridges
to be constructed.
Considerable investigations and research have been done on the properties of
concrete and the science of testing it and the diagnosis of distresses in it has
been developed over these years although
a lot still remains to be done. This
chapter on testing and diagnosis is, therefore, devoted to 'Concrete Bridges'.
4.2.
Investigation
A review of available drawings to identify vulnerable details should
be done before investigation. Investigation is to be carried out at three levels,
namely a visual survey to assess the overall integrity of
the bridge,a general
survey including a limited amount of physical testing to plan more detailed
investigation and possible
rehabilitation and
finally a detailed survey
to
determine the extent and precise location of deterioration or damage for the
purpose of evaluating the capacity of the structure. Careful planning is required



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 132
======================================================================
21
to identify the required
information on the human and technical resources
which must be carried out under the supervision of an expert engineer, who
can modify the procedures as the investigation progresses, depending upon the
needs.
Broadly speaking,
the
visual methods
are very
useful
to detect
cracking, scaling, wear and abrasion; the electrical and the chemical methods
are of some help for corrosion detection; ultrasonic methods are more suitable
for crack detection, while the thermography and radar techniques are suitable
for detecting delamination and
scaling beneath bituminous
surfacings.
Radiography and air permeability techniques have only a limited applicability
to detect corrosion and voids in grout.
4.3.
Visual Inspections
Visual inspection by an expert who has previously handled similar
situations
is the essential preliminary step.
The degradation processes are
likely
to become apparent (though
not
true
for
all prestressed concrete
structures) much before the load bearing capacity gets seriously reduced as
many advanced warning signs like spalling, rust stains would be available and
corrosion and other types of defects
like
cracks, excessive
deflections,
excessive
vibrations,
loss of camber, malfunction of joints and hinges,
deformation, performance of bearing, drainage system, water-proofing etc.,
should be observed.
It
is necessary
to provide proper access
to various
components of the bridge to ensure a thorough inspection.
But for sensitive
details which cannot be inspected visually, drawings should be examined.
4.4.
Testing Methods
4.4. 1
.
Classification of tests
: A variety of non- destructive testing
methods have been developed and are under development for investigating
different properties of concrete
in
addition
to the
vital
visual inspection
described earlier. Tests are aimed at assessment of strength and other properties
and to locate and obtain
comparative results indicating permeable regions,
cracks or laminations and areas of lower integrity than the rest. It is essential
to emphasise here, that it is not necessary to carry out all the tests in each case
except the most
relevant ones.
Facilities for a number of tests are
still not
available in India, but have been mentioned as they might become available
later. Also, not much may be achieved by spending time and money on carrying
out other than the most essential tests in many cases.
In fact, in some cases,
engineering judgements could help decisions faster. The tests can be broadly



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 132
======================================================================
22
classified under different groups as shown in the Table 4.1.
Table 4.2 gives
abstract of test for investigating potential corrosion of reinforcement in R.C.
and prestressed concrete structures.
4.4.2.
Chemical tests
:
(i)
Carbonation
:
The carbonation of concrete on the surface
results in loss of alkaline protection of the cover over the steel
against corrosion. Carbon-dioxide of atomosphere reacts with
hydrated cement compounds causing reduction in alkanity of
concrete and the process is referred to as Carbonation.
The
depth of the carbonation
is measured by spraying on
the
freshly broken surface of concrete with 0.10 per cent solution
of phenolphthalein. The concrete undergoes, a colour change
(from purple red to colourless) when pH value is below
10.
The colour of the concrete surface after the spraying indicates
the depth of carbonation.
(ii)
Sulphate attack
: The concrete attacked by sulphate has a
characteristic white appearance. The quantity of sulphate is
estimated by the precipitation of barium sulphate and sulphate
confined by identification of Calcium Sulpho Aluminate by
X-ray or microscopy.
(iii)
Chloride content
: This
test should be done under expert
guidance and proper sampling procedures need to be evolved
due to high variability of laboratory test results. The chloride
content in concrete
is measured
in
laboratory
by
Mohr's
method
using potassium chromate as indicator in a neutral
medium or by Volhard's volumetric titration method in acidic
medium. The presence of acid soluble chlorides in concrete
beyond the permissible
limit
is considered as a corrosion
hazard in concrete structures. Rapid tests for in-situ chloride
determination are being developed.

4.4.3.
Non -destructive test methods (NDT)
:
(i)
Schmidt hammer and other tests
: These are used to measure
hardness of concrete surface
which can be related to
its
strength.
The instrument used is very handy.
The pull-out
methods and penetration
resistance techniques
are
also
adopted for estimation of strength of concrete and assessment
of its overall quality.
(ii)
Magnetic methods
:
These are methods used to determine
the position of reinforcement with reference to the surface of
concrete and thus adequacy or otherwise of the cover over the
reinforcement can be assessed. Pachometers detect position of
reinforcement and measure the depth of cover. A battery
is
used to generate magnetic field which gets distorted where
there is steel in the vicinity
of
the
probe.
Portable battery
operated cover-meters (Fig.4.1) can measure the cover with
an accuracy of 5 mm upto a depth of about 75 mm.
(iii)
Radar technique
: A high frequency pulsed radar can be used
to detect deterioration in concrete decks. The echos produced
from the pavement surface and the interface of the bridge deck
concrete, in case of bituminous surfaced bridge decks, are very
distinct so that thickness can be measured accurately, (Fig.
4.2).
Short duration pulses of radio-frequency energy are
directed into the deck portion and are reflected from any
interface and the output is displayed on an oscilloscope. The
interface can be any discontinuity or differing dielectric, such
as,
air
to surfacing to concrete or cracks
in concrete.
A
permanent record can be stored on magnetic tape and the unit
is normally mounted on a vehicle and data are collected as the
vehicle moves slowly across the deck.
(iv)
Radiography
:
Radiographic techniques are applied on the
prestressing
cables
to
detect defects
in
the cable and
to
examine
the
quality of grouts within
the
ducts.
Most
'
applications involve transmission of wave energy rather than
the reflection or refraction methods. The emerging radiation
is detected by photographic emulsion
or by a
radiation
detector.
The former
is called radiography and
the
latter
radiometry.
The back-scatter techniques based on reflected

intensity of X-rays can be used to detect the voids in grout and
testing strands or wires which are broken or are out of position.
However, small amounts of corrosion will not be detected and
the technique is suitable only for isolated cables without any
other obstruction in the path of the wave.
)
Thermography
:
Infra-red thermography
is a method of
detecting delamination in bridge decks and columns exposed
directly
to
sun.
The method works on
the principle
that
discontinuity within
the concrete, such
as delamination,
interrupts the heat transfer through concrete. The differences
in surface temperature are measured by sensitive infra-red
detection systems which consist of infra- red signal, control
unit and a display
screen.
The images
get recorded on
photographic plates or video tapes.
The equipment can be
truck-mounted permitting a lane width to be scanned by a
single pass. The main disadvantage of thermography is that
while a positive result is valid, a negative result may not be
always reliable because it relates to results under conditions
prevailing at the time of tests. Nevertheless, the method itself
has a considerable promise as a rapid screening
tool
for
determining whether a more detailed investigation is required.
)
Nuclear and radioactive method
: The density of concrete
upto 100mm depth can be assessed by using the gamma-ray
back scatter device. The concrete is irradiated from a portable
neutron source and absorption of neutrons by chloride ions
simulates emission of gamma radiation of a particular energy.
The presence of moisture can be similarly detected by
measuring the simulated emission of gamma radiation by
hydrogen atoms. However, the readings would not give depth
of penetration of chloride ions. The test is a highly specialised
one.
)
Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement
:
The quality of
concrete can be assessed by passing through concrete the
ultrasonic
pulse and measuring
the
velocity,
(Fig.4.3).
Measured values may be affected by surface texture, moisture
content, temperature, specimen size, reinforcement and stress.
Co-relations with strength are difficult to make and will be



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 132
======================================================================
influenced by types and proportions of mix constituents and
maturity. Calibration on tested cores is essential.
Fig.4.3
Methods of measuring pulse velocity through concrete
4.4.4.
Partially destructive tests:
(i)
Pull-out strength of hardened concrete
:
It is possible to
assess
the comparative
strength of hardened concrete by
co-relating
it to the pulling force (required to pull the
metal
devices inserted in
concrete). A large number of such tests
need to be carried out.
(ii)
Coring
:
This
is
a somewhat destructive method of
assessment under which core of concrete from the structure is
drilled with the help of a coring machine.
The core is then
analysed in a laboratory for various properties including its
strength. Core drilling machines of the size of brief-case are
available commercially.
(iii)
Endoscopy consists of usually flexible viewing tubes which
can be inserted into holes drilled in the bridge components or



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 132
======================================================================
33
into a cable duct of the prestressed concrete.
A
light
is
provided by
optical
fibres from
external
source.
The
endoscopes are available with attachments for a camera or a
TV Monitor and are used for detailed examination of parts of
the bridge structure which cannot otherwise be assessed. They
are useful in detecting voids in the grout, concrete, corrosion
in steel etc. This test if required, should preferably be done in
association with radiographics and should be done under
expert guidance.
)
Other methods
: Electrical corrosion detection
device
:
The electrode (half-cell) potential of reinforcement embedded
in concrete provides a measure of the corrosion
risk and
indicates whether electro- chemical reaction has taken place
on the electrode surface.
The electrical potential difference
between the steel and electrode (concrete)
is measured with
copper/copper sulphate half-cell or copper calomel electrode
or silver chloride electrode, (Fig.4.4).
The pathfinder and
potential wheel, marketed recently, are refined versions of
copper/copper sulphate electrode
for better scanning.
However, this method does not give information on the rate
of corrosion, and also it gives only the probability of activity
of corrosion.
However,
it has been recently reported that
C.E.C.R.I. Karaikudi has succeeded in giving quantitative
indications of corrosion in steel by electrical devices (vide
Appendix 1).
)
Response to vibration
: The objective of vibration testing is
to relate the defects in the bridges to the changes in its dynamic
characteristics.
The vibration analysis of a structure carried
out over a period of time measures loss of stiffness and not the
loss of strength, although the former seldom
implies loss of
strength. However, a serious loss of strength in an individual
member may occur before
there
is a measurable
loss of
stiffness in the overall structure.
Sometimes, accelerometers
are temporarily attached to the bridge and the traffic/wind
induced vibrations are recorded. The modes of vibration and
damping can then be determined by computerised analysis.
Sometimes, a variable frequency sinusoidal force is applied at
a point in the bridge the response at other points is measured
which depends mainly on
the
fixity and
stiffness of



======================================================================

======================================================================
34
connections. With proper application, the cracks can also be
detected by
this method.
The
vibration methods show
considerable promise although the methods of interpretation
of results in terms of the type of defects and its cause are yet
to be developed.

The various non-destructive and other evaluation methods
have several limitations as there are various parameters influencing each test
and many a time
combination of different methods have to be used during
investigations.
Recendy, in-situ permeability testing equipment has also become
available for assessing
trie quality of concrete although doubts are being
expressed about the reliability of results.
A general summary of the capabilities of the various test methods to
detect different forms of defects or deterioration is given in the Table 4.3. This
Table provides comparison amongst the methods and can be used in planning
an investigation.

4.5.
Full Scale Load Testing of Bridges
The above techniques present possibilities of making an assessment
of the overall condition of the bridge or changes in the condition and of
detecting faults.
But,
it is often difficult to analyse the effects or defects or
deterioration on the overall performance of the bridge or on the stresses in
individual components. A full scale ioad test can, therefore, be useful. Load
tests can be expensive and on larger bridges they require considerable planning,
involve many people and demand the use of sophisticated equipment. Testing
in remote locations can present additional difficulties. Particular care is needed
for bridges with brittle failure
modes.
However, load
testing can often be
justified where
the effect of defects and/or deterioration
on
load capacity
cannot be determined by analysis alone. However, a decision to
carry out
full
scale load
testing
should
not
be
undertaken
without a serious
thought.The actual procedure
for load
testing
for rating of bridges
and
interpretation of tests have already been described
in IRC:SP:37. So the
procedure
for load
testing
is not described
here; but principles and
instrumentation and equipment used in load testing are given below
:
(a)
Bridge testing is both an art and a science. In its simplest form,
load testing involves measuring the response of the bridge to
a known applied load. Considerable experience is required to
know where to locate gauges and to determine load increments
and the maximum load to be applied to prevent damage to the



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 132
======================================================================
bridge.
The load
is applied, usually by vehicles although
occasionally by dead load or through
cables,
to induce
maximum effects. Where measurement of stress at a given
location under known load
is
all
that
is
required,
data
processing may not be a major consideration.
In other cases,
the amount of data recorded
is often extensive such
that
automatic data recording and analysis is highly desirable.
It
is also preferable that this be done on site as the test progresses
so that deviations from anticipated behaviour are known and
the necessary changes in procedure or equipment can be made.
Because concrete properties are required
to define
stress
values (from strain measurements), samples must be taken
from the structure.
b)
Several types of strain gauges can be used in conjunction with
load
testing bridges and jacks can be used
to determine
reactions at the supports.
c)
Comparators are mechanical,
electrical or electronic
instruments used
to measure
the distance between
studs
attached to the structure.
The distance between the studs is
usuallty in the range of 50 to 200mm and the sensitivity of the
instruments
is
typically 0.01
to 0.05 mm.
The main
application of comparators is to measure the change in width
of a crack under load or over time.
d)
Resistance wire strain gauges are cemented directly to the
material under
investigations.
Dummy gauges are
incorporated
in
the
electrical
circuit
to compensate
for
temperature
effects.
Strains, which are measured by
the
change
in
the
electrical
resistance of the gauges, can be
determined very
accurately, generally between
1 and
3
micro-strain.
The interpretation of the result
is, however,
often difficult because of the small size of the gauges and the
non-homogenous nature of concrete.
Several gauges must
therefore be attached to the structure in the area of interest in
order to identify anomalous results.
Resistance wire gauges
-
are not suitable for use on cracked concrete because a change
in straiii i.iay stress them beyond their linear range.



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 132
======================================================================
37
(e)
Rosette gauges, which contain three resistors set in a known
angle (generally 45 degrees or 60 degrees), can be used to
calculate the direction and magnitude of the principal stresses.
(f)
Vibrating wire gauges consist of a metal wire stretched inside
a tube which is embedded in the concrete. The wire is vibrated
by an electromagnet and
the frequency of vibration
is
measured, from which
the
strain
in
the concrete can be
calculated. Since the gauge is about 150mm long, the results
are not affected by localised heterogenetics in the concrete,
but cracks cause the same kind of problems as with resistance
strain gauges.
(g)
Jacks can be used to measure the reactions at the supports of
the
structure. This may be required
for such purpose
as
assessing
the impact of thermal gradients, or
the
re-distribution of stresses due to creep, settlement or faulty
construction. The technique consists of measuring the force
and movement as the structure is raised. A relationship such
as that shown in (Fig. 4.5) is obtained, from which the reaction
at the support can be determined. This type of test is expensive
and, in addition to the requirement for suitable jacking points,
A

resulting from jacking a support



======================================================================

======================================================================
38
the deck joints must be removed together with any other
feature which might interfere with the free movement of the
jack.
Using good quality, properly calibrated equipment, an
accuracy of 0.3
to 1.0 per cent is attainable, with load cells.
It may however be noted that even calibrated jacks are about
±5% accurate if only the hydraulic pressure is monitored.

REPAIRS AND STRENGTHENING
TECHNIQUES - GENERAL
5.1.
Criteria for Selection
It
is intended
to cover
in
this chapter only
the more important
techniques and materials used for bridge repairs and strengthening.
The
maintenance techniques described in the separate guidelines for inspection and
maintenance of bridges are not repeated. The criteria for selection of materials
and techniques for repairs and strengthening could be
:
(i)
Causes of distresses
;
(ii)
Efficacy of the materials and techniques in the preservation
and/or enhancing the load carrying capacity of the structure;
(iii)
Availability of materials and equipment
;
(iv)
Importance of the bridge;
(v)
Time available;
(vi)
Life expectancy; and
(vii)
Feasibility of traffic diversion.
5.2.
Repairs of Foundations
It
is not possible
to evolve a general method
for repairs and/or
strengthening of foundations. Each case has to be analysed individually and
may require special investigations. Most repair works for foundations are in
the category of protection and strengthening. Some examples are given below:
Scour and erosion protection and repair of washed
away/damaged protection works.

Strengthening of foundations due to widening of a channel

Repair of underwater bridge structures.
Repair of serrations on the surface caused by high velocity
of particles in the water.
Note
: Foundation movements can substantially increase the loads
and moments
in some parts of the superstructure by
redistribution. This must always be checked for.
It is not possible to list causes of deficiency of underwater structures
as they are too numerous.
The same, also, applies to the combinations of
conditions requiring repairs.
Given the wide range, of materials and repairs
techniques the choice of the most appropriate technique is difficult. Table 5.1
gives a
list of possible remedial measures according
to the nature of the
problems. Some of the repair works carried out for foundations are described
below for information and guidance though, as already mentioned, each case
has to be decided on its merit. Guidance could be obtained from IRC: 89- 1985
"Guidelines for Design and Construction of River Training and Control Works
for Road Bridges".

======================================================================
Protection against scour
: Excessive scour is one of the more
frequent factors that may cause or lead to structural failure or
distress of the foundation. The degree of damage depends on
factors
such
as the stream bed material, the intensity of
discharge, the silt charge, obliquity of stream flow and the
shape of the structure.
For deciding the extent and type of repair arising out of
excessive scour, ascertaining the causative factors, such as
change in the alignment of the stream, an inadequate waterway
or the presence of debris, is of great help. Determining the
most effective solution to a scour problem is often difficult
and may require model studies to be carried out.
Spur dykes,
jetties,
deflectors and other devices may be
constructed to direct water away from a fill, bridge pier, or
abutment. Caution is needed because only correctly designed
and constructed
training works are
helpful
in
controlling
scour and erosion.
Repair of damages caused by channel
scour may vary from simple solutions such as replacement of
displaced material to complicated solutions like redesigning
the footing, construction of training works or sheet piling, or
other modifications of the structure or channel.
At sites, where soil erosion has occurred because of stream or
tidal action, it is a common practice to place rock or rip-rap
material in the void or to protect the replaced soil with rip-rap,
bagged concrete rip-rap or grouted or wire enclosed boulders.
Piers and abutments may be protected or repaired by placing
sheet piling to keep material in place or to prevent further
scour.
Sheet piling should be driven
to a depth where
non-erodible
soil conditions or rock
exist.
The overhead
clearance required or
under substructures may be a major
disadvantage in using sheet piling.
If supporting material has
been removed from under a
large area of the
footing,
consideration should be given to redesigning the foundation,
including filling the void with concrete.
In some cases, the
footing may be extended by using sheet piling as forms for the
extension and as stay-in-place protection against further scour.
If scour has exposed supporting piles,
it may be necessary,



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 132
======================================================================
43
particularly if they are short, to drive supplemental piles that
are part of the extended footing.
To restrict scour around piers it is also common to utilise what
is known
as
'garlanding technique'.
In
this, very heavy
concrete blocks or stones of
designed weight are placed
around the pier foundations below the bed level by excavation.
The size of the garland and the weight should be properly
designed.
It is advisable to consult experts before deciding/undertaking
the solution of a serious repair problem.
(3)
Foundations on soft rock subject to erosion can be protected
by reinforced concrete curtain walls enclosing the footing or
piles.
(4)
Increasing the bearing capacity of the soil by injecting cement
or chemical grout taking care that grout pressure does not
exceed the overburden pressures.
(5)
Rock or ground anchors are often used for abutments where
protective slope had
to be removed
for say widening of
navigable channel, road, etc. Normally a protective sheet pile
wall is driven first in the case of ground anchors. Design and
execution of rock ground anchors requires great care and
should take into account all factors likely to affect the bearing
capacity and durability of the anchoring system. Now a days,
prestressed anchors are also used.
(6)
Extension of existing foundations
: This would be necessary
while widening an existing bridge.
(7)
Liquefaction of foundation soil
: Some foundation failures
during earthquakes could be
the
result of excessive
soil
movements
especially due
to
liquefaction. There are two
approaches to retrofitting that will mitigate these types of
failures
:
i)
Eliminate or improve
soil conditions
that tend
to be
responsible for seismic liquefaction, and



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 132
======================================================================
ii)
Increase the ability of the structure to withstand large
relative displacements
similar
to those caused by
liquefaction or large soil movements.
Some methods are available for stabilising the soil at the site
of the structure. Each method should be individually designed
making use of established principles of soil mechanics to
ensure
that the design
is
effective and
that construction
procedures will not damage the existing bridge.
Possible
methods for soil stabilisation include
:
Lowering of ground water table;
consolidation of
soil by vibrofloatation or sand
compaction;
placement of permeable over-burden;
soil grouting or chemical injection.
At a
site subjected
to excessive
liquefaction,methods
to
improve the structure may be ineffective unless coupled with
methods to stablilise the site.
Underwater work
: While dealing with underwater work, it
will be relevant
to refer
to underwater inspection
also.
Inspection of underwater portions of the structures
is very
difficult because of the harsher environment, poor visibility,
deposition of marine organisms
etc.
To do an
effective
underwater
inspection,
it
is necessary
to deploy properly
trained and equipped supervisory personnel. The quality of
inspection underwater should be equal
to
the quality of
inspection above water.
Clearing the marine growth from
underwater portions of a bridge is almost always necessary.
Visual inspection is a primary work of detecting underwater
problems.
In turbid waters, the inspector should use tactile
examination to detect flaws, damage or deterioration. In some
cases sophisticated techniques, ultra-sonic thickness gauges,
computerised tomography or TV monitors may be required.
After the initial identification of a trouble spot of the damage,
for the purpose of detailed examination and carrying out
repairs
it may be necessary either to expose the member by
means of a cofferdam and dewatering or by providing a small
air-lock as described later.

Normally, inspection of under water components ofa bridge is carried
out with the use of divers who are usually non-qualified as bridge inspectors.
It would be useful to train some of the engineers in diving techniques so that
they as qualified divers can interpret the observations in a more
scientific
way.
Underwater photographic
techniques are also available
wherein
damages are detected by divers who can then take photos of affected areas.
Similarly, underwater cameras (mounted on diver's head gears) can be used to
scan
the various components of submerged portions of the
structure
continuously and signals can be read on a TV monitor kept on the bridge deck.
A new technique using acoustic microscopy* measurements has been
developed abroad for underwater
study.
In
this, measurement of small
electrical potential differences caused by corrosion current in sea water is
combined with acoustic inspection to determine the crack width and depth.
Computerised tomography is yet another recent method to locate voids and
steel reinforcement in underwater concrete. A gamma ray source is collimated
to form a flat fan of rays which are attennuated as they pass through the
approach to a set of detectors. The source detector apparatus is rotated to obtain
a series of projections through the same cross sections (Fig.5. 1).
It is, however,
reported that
this technique
is npt yet well developed and
is reliable
in
laboratory conditions only.
But, Sonar procedures for mapping scour are
useful.
Placing of concrete under water can be carried out with the help of
conventional underwater bucket or tremie concrete, although under certain
conditions placing of pre-packed concrete or bagged concrete or pumped
concrete may be more suitable.
In all such underwaterrepairs the surfaces of
the pile or well or pier have to be cleaned of the dirt and other foreign material
and after removing the cracked and unsound concrete the surface is to be
prepared for receiving new concrete.
Suitable priming coat by materials like
moisture compatible epoxy resin is helpful to ensure proper bonding. The piles
or columns are substantially deteriorated through actions of corrosion or other
factors can be provided with
integral jackets which may or may not be
reinforced depending on the thickness of the jacket.
It is often useful to provide
temporary cofferdam which can be fixed to the pile at the base and the water
can be pumped out.
Joint of the jacket at its ends has to be properly detailed
out and treated with epoxy. Grouting with quick setting cement or epoxy can
also be carried out where necessary.
Not yet introduced in India

Methods used by divers to perform underwater sealing and repairing
of cracks by epoxy injections are similar to methods used above water, except
that the epoxy surface sealer takes several days
to harden sufficiendy
to
withstand injection pressure.
For underwater use, epoxies must be water
insensitive.
Before
the application of epoxy
surface
sealer, cleaning
is
necessary.
If oil or other contaminants are present in the cracks, and the epoxy
is used for restoring the strength of the cracked concrete pier or pile instead of
simply blocking the free entry of water in the crack, bonding will be improved
by mixing detergents or special chemicals with a water jet to clean the crack
interiors.
After all cracks are prepared and sealed and the nipples positioned
the low viscosity epoxy adhesive is injected under pressure into the crack
network. A surface-mounted, positive-displacement pump is used to dispense
the two components of the adhesive to the submerged injection sites where the
components are mixed in the injection head as
it is pressure-pumped into
concrete.Water temperatures must be above 4 degrees centigrade.
The
adhesive cures to full strength in about 7 days. Cracks upto 2mm width may
be sealed with straight epoxy resin (without
filler). For wider cracks, the



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 132
======================================================================
47
addition of a filler is generally required.
Now-a-days, for underwater repair
works, devices called 'Habitat' are used.
Habitat is a multi- cell metal unit
open at the bottom with water- tight joints. This is installed around the member
to be repaired. With compressed air, the Habitat is kept dry so that the divers
can undertake repairs (Fig.5.2).
Various methods are currently used to prevent the corrosion of steel
piling in sea water, including application of protective coatings, encasement
of the
steel
in concrete or a combination of these procedures.
Cathodic
protection can also work well for mis.
5.3.
Repairs To Masonry Structures
Existing masonry bridges are sometimes considered as
historical
landmarks and need preservation. Strengthening and widening will, therefore,
mean maintaining the same appearance. Widening is usually not possible but
strengthening can often be done. Strengthening of Masonry Bridges ensuring
pleasant appearance
is a delicate task and needs advice from experts in these
fields.The following gives an idea of the general defects and remedial measures
for such arch bridges in stone or brick masonry.
(i)
Loss of Bond for the Crown stone: Flat jacks have been
successfully used for pushing the stone back to
its original
position. Generally, low pressure cement grouting is done to
strengthen the old mortar. The mortar is sometimes replaced
by epoxy mortar also, though epoxy is not ideal.
(ii)
Longitudinal cracks along the direction of traffic
:
It
is
possible to rake mortar joints and refill with cement mortar.
However it must be mentioned mat the depth
of penetration
is important as usually it is
not
possible
to suspend traffic.
If possible, the
portion of earth
fill could
be
removed to
ensure that penetration
is limited
to
masonry only. Fine
cement grouting
(injection)
can be adopted
for remedial
measures. Generally it is cheaper and better to grout the cracks
with cement than with epoxy.
(iii)
Transverse Cracks
: Injection of cement will provide a good
bond between stones and brick masonry.

(iv)
Strengthening of Arch Rings
:
The arch ring can be
strengthened in two ways - by adding material to the intrados
or to the extrados.
Adding to the intrados causes the least
disturbance but
is more difficult to complete successfully.
Also it results in a reduction in headroom or clearance which
is often restricted and will, in most cases be the cause of new
damage to the intrados as experienced on many bridges even
where the headroom/clearance
satisfies legal
limits. Extra
material may be placed by shuttering and pumping concrete
(which is difficult to compact at the crown) or by fixing a mesh
to the intrados and spraying concrete. In both cases, any
shrinkage of the new concrete will tend to make the old and
the new material separate radially. Also these impervious
rings prevent natural drainage between the stones or brick
work of the arch so that special provision must be made to deal
with water or under severe climatic conditions,such
as
inmountainous regions, with ice. Sprayed-on concrete will in
any case change the appearance of an arch constructed of
stone, brick or a combination of the two.
A more effective, but at times a
more expensive, treatment
is to
remove the fill and cast the extra required thickness on the
extrados of the
arch.
Usually, a full ring is cast but occasionally only the end quarters are
strengthened to act as cantilevers and reduce the effective span of the arch.
Normal concrete placing techniques are satisfactory.
Replacement backfill
may be with normal or lightweight concrete. The latter will reduce dead load
on the foundations but may also reduce the factor of safety for stability of the
substructure.
Another expedient which is satisfactory where the increase in load
carrying capacity is relatively small, especially for small span bridges, is to
cast slab at road level to act as an
auxiliary
deck which spreads the wheel
loads.
For cracks
in
arches, grouting with cement,
at pressure 4
to 6
Kg/Sq.cm is sometimes quite effective, though care should be taken to see that
pressure will not damage the surrounding masonry.

Repairs to Concrete Structures
Since the majority of bridge structures will b^ of concrete, RCC as
well as Prestressed Concrete, the techniques are described in a separate Chapter
VI.
5.5.
Repairs to Composite Structures
Comparatively very few defects
have
been reported with well
designed and fabricated shear connectors.
Problems with concrete decks in
composite structures are essentially of the same kind and order of magnitude
as those found in concrete decks in regular structure.
It is likely that some early
structures are seriously inadequate with regard to shear connectors for the
heavier design loads now specified. The same can be also said for the main
load carrying
structural
steel components.
Difficulties may be encountered with deck replacement or even major
deck rehabilitation and strengthening operations in those composite bridges in
which
residual
relieving
stresses have been
introduced by
sophisticated
erection procedures combined with an elaborate casting sequence for the
bridge deck. Such cases would be very few in this country.
In reconstructing deck slabs, use of very high pressure water jetting
say 10,000 psi, to remove the concrete around shear connectors is considered
preferable to jack hammers so as to minimise damage.
5.6.
Repairs to Steel Structures
5.6.1
Deck replacement of older steel bridges
: Many of the old
bridges
(usually truss or arch bridges)have
either warped steel plates with a
bituminous surfacing or a concrete deck. Due to insufficient waterproofing
the steel
plates are
often corroded.
Bridge decks can be replaced by new concrete decks or by new
orthotropic
steel decks, though these have not been used in India so
far.
Usually,when a reduction in dead load or additional widening (adding
cycle
or pedestrian lanes) are necessary, replacement by an orthotropic steel deck
is preferred. Bolting is the preferred method of connecting the new deck system
to existing structural members.
Depending on the type of bridge and the load carrying capacity of its
structural components, the new concrete deck is placed as a non-composite



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 132
======================================================================
51
element, as a partially composite element (e.g. in composite action with the
stringer and/or cross beams) or as a totally composite element (i.e. in composite
action with all main load carrying elements).
The use of light weight concrete is often preferred in such cases where
reduction in dead load is an important factor. Sometimes to save weight, a type
of steel grid decking is used where the grids can be either left open or filled
with concrete.
5.6.2
Strengthening of structural members
:
Strengthening
usually involves more conventional
techniques such
as
installing new
diaphragms to existing double compression members (increasing buckling
strength), strengthening or replacement of diagonals.
Plate girders may be
strengthened by external prestressing cables, anchored and fixed on the web
in the required parabolic curvature acting in a similar way as in prestressed
concrete.
Strengthening is sometimes concerned with compression failure and
has involved the addition of stiffeners to flanges, webs, and diaphragms.
5.6.3
Repair of cracks
:
Cracks can be due to any one or a
combination of the following reasons
:
poor detailing so that high stress concentrations are present,
increased traffic loading beyond what was
anticipated by
the designer,
an unexpected secondary structural action,
inadequate analysis of complex stresses,
a large undetected fabrication flaw.
Crack repair methods depend on the root cause of crack initiation.
The structure and especially those components which influence the overall
safety of the structure should be analysed.



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 132
======================================================================
52
5.6.4
Action to be taken when a crack is detected or suspected
in welded steel bridge girders
:
(i)
Location should be marked distinctly with point.
Ends of
cracks should also be accurately marked to monitor crack
propagation.
(ii)
Length and orientation of crack should be recorded.
Sketch
should be prepared indicating location and details of crack.
If
necessary photographs may be taken.
(iii)
If necessary, crack should be examined
in
detail using
non-destructive inspection methods
like dye penetrant,
ultrasonic etc.
(iv)
If a crack is suspected at any location, paint film should be
removed and detailed examination carried out using
magnifying
glass, dye penetrant inspection
or ultrasonic
inspection as necessary.
(v)
If more identical details exist on the girder, they should also
be inspected in detail.
(vi)
Crack should be fully documented in the bridge inspection
register and action initiated for its early repair.
(vii)
The crack and
girder should be kept under observations
depending on the severity of crack and frequency of inspection
suitably
increased.
If situation
warrants,
suitable speed
restriction may be imposed.
(viii)
Significance and severity of crack should be studied on the
load carrying capacity of the girder.
(ix)
Repair of retrofit scheme should be prepared
after
fully
investigating
the cause of crack and implemented
at the
earliest.
Repairs can be made by techniques such as drilling holes at the crack
tip (this should only be done in less sensitive locations), cutting out the cracked
material and bolting plates in place, cutting out the crack and rewelding with
a higher class weld (e.g. increasing the size and penetration of a fillet weld),



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 132
======================================================================
53
strengthening the connection by introducing stiffening and by changing the
structural action so that loads are supported in a way that prevents high stress
range from developing.
5.6.5
Underwater welding
: Arc welding has become an accepted
procedure
in underwater construction, salvage and repair operation.
Underwater welds made on mild steel plate under test conditions carried out
in developed countries, have consistently developed over 80 per cent of the
tensile strength and 50 per cent of the ductility of similar welds made in air.
The reduction in ductility
is caused by hardening due to drastic quenching
action of the surrounding water. Structural-quality welds have been produced
by means of special equipment and procedures
that create small, dry
atmosphere in which the welding
is performed.
However,
this process
is
expensive.
Gas welding under water is not considered to be a feasible procedure.
A word of warning appears appropriate.
Although arc welding and
gas cutting are now common underwater techniques, electric shock is an ever
present hazard.
This hazard can only be minimised through
the careful
application of established procedures.
5.6.6
Use of steel arch superposition scheme
:
This can be used
to
strengthen
old
truss
bridges.
The
strengthening scheme
consists of
superimposed arches, hangars and additional floor beams.
The concept of
combining a truss with an arch is by no means a new system. The idea is that
a light arch can carry a significant load if properly supported laterally. In this
case, the truss with its cross-beams provides the lateral support while the arch
in combination with the
hangars and
additional floor beams provides the
increased load
carrying capacity.
Additional floor beams and
hangars are
used for two reasons
:
the more uniform the load distribution, the more efficient the
arch will be in carrying the load.
the floor systems of many old truss bridges get deteriorated
and are sometimes underdesigned and unreliable.
The scheme of
strengthening
by a
steel arch
superposition
is
illustrated in Fig. 5.3.



======================================================================

Fig.5.3
Steel arch superimposition to strengthen old truss bridge
The thrust of the arch can be resisted by one of the following means:
the abutments, provided they are adequate and
in good
condition, or they can readily be repaired or strengthened,
a reinforced lower chord,
superimposed cables or rods,
properly designed and detailed stringers or floor slab.
The arch superposition scheme can be considered as an overall
strengthening measure. The load carrying capacity of the entire structure is
upgraded, thus allowing the live load to be increased.
There is no need for
temporary shoring
or jacking
for the
installation of the
superpositioned
elements.
The increase in dead load can be expected to be in the order of
approximately 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The slender arch contributes only
modest amounts of additional stiffness to the truss.
5,6.7
Excessive vibrations
: These can be overcome by suitable
structural alterations and increased damping for which a specialist in dynamic
behaviour o( structures may have to be consulted.

Repairs to Timber Structures
Except for giving treatment to wood, there are no special techniques
for repairs of timber structures.
The distressed members could be either
replaced or strengthened with steel plates.

for some problems.

techniques

distresses.
6. REPAIRS AND STRENGTHENING TECHNIQUES
FOR CONCRETE BRIDGES
6. 1
Repair Work Not Requiring Strengthening
It may be categorised as below
:
(i)
Repair of the concrete surface
(ii)
Repair of concrete cracks
(iii)
Repair of corroded
steel reinforcement and repairs
related
to high tensile steel in PSC
(iv)
Repair of porous concrete and holes
The details are given in subsequent para
:
6. 1
. 1
.
Repair of the concrete surface
6.1.1.1. Preparation of the surface
:
In all cases where concrete
surfaces are repaired, the condition of the existing concrete in the exposed
damaged area is of primary importance in the durability of the repair.
The
latter can be seriously compromised if there is a poor adhesion between the
fresh concrete of the repair and the existing concrete surface. Therefore, it is
important that the contact surface is in sound concrete and that all foreign
materials are removed that might affect or otherwise impair the repair.
In
general, damaged and fractured concrete must be removed to a sound surface
which must be properly treated and for this several methods are available
:
mechanical methods,



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 132
======================================================================
56
thermal methods,
chemical methods, and
hydraulic methods.
The choice of a suitable method depends on the situation, especially
on the extent and thickness of the layer which has to be removed, as well as on
the type, location and position of the damage in the structure. The thermal and
chemical methods are rarely used and are restricted to special circumstances
and hence have not been described here.
(i)
Mechanical Methods
In
general, Mechanical equipment
is preferable, as
it
is more
intensive, reliable and speedy.
When choosing and applying mechanical
methods, it must be ensured that the sound concrete and the reinforcement are
not damaged by them.
If necessary, trials should be carried out under realistic
circumstances. During
a mechanical removal of concrete,dust will always
occur. However, the surface must be made free of dust on completion of the
work. Normally used methods are milling, chipping, sand blasting, water or
steam blasting and compressed air cleaning.
(ii)
Hydraulic Methods
Hydraulic methods such as use of water jetting are also in use and are
considered preferable to jack hammers for preventing damage. A water jet
with 10 to 40 MPa pressure at the jet will remove loose particles, scaled
concrete or remove vegetation coatings.
This method is not applicable for
roughening of solid concrete surface.
In high pressure water-jet method, the
pressure at the jet is 40 to 120 MPa. This is most efficient for removal of soft
areas of the concrete surface.
In hydro-jet method, the jet pressure is kept at
140 to 240 MPa. In this, the water-jet is capable of a deep penetration into the
concrete or even cutting grooves in
it.
Such high pressure water-jets need
careful handling or else things could be hazardous. This method is essentially
free of vibrations, but there will be deep penetration of moisture into the
concrete.

6.1.1.2.
Bonding agents
(a)
General
Bonding agents are recommended to improve the bond between old
concrete and the new repair concrete.
There are two different types of bond
mechanisms:
physical bond through adhesion and cohesion; and
chemical adhesion through reaction with the surface.
In most cases, both types of bonding exist in combination. There are
several types of bonding agents explained in the following paragraphs.
(b)
Cement paste
This bonding agent consists
of a cement paste with a low
water/cement ratio which is brushed into the surface to be repaired.
(c)
Cement slurry
Another bonding agent is cement mortar, which can be of high or low
viscosity, consisting of equal parts of cement and sand along with water.
It
can, however, also consist of the repair mortar itself, from which the coarse
aggregate has been removed.
(d)
Bonding systems of polymer modified cement
Generally, in these systems, the polymer is mixed into the cement
paste or cement mortar via the mixing water.
Dispersions free of plasticizers
with certain portions of solid substances such as vinyl-propionate-copolymers
or acrylic resin dispersions or poly- vinylacetatc-dispersions may be added to
the mix.
In some instances, emulsions may be used. The effect depends on
the type of resin being used. These additives are often used not only to improve
the bond strength, but also to improve the workability and water retention
capacity.



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 132
======================================================================
58
(e)
Resins
There are two basic types of bonding agents made of two component
resins: emulsifiable agents and normal agents.
The first case consists of a
combination of a water emulsifiable epoxy resin, a polyamide resin hardener
and a filling material. The epoxy resin and the hardener are initially mixed
together before placement. Filler may be permitted in a suitable designed ratio.
If required, the mixture may be diluted with water. In the two component resin
bonding agents, a pure resin-hardener-mixture is used, with or without fillers.
Resins with filling materials are used in practice for the following reasons
:
filling materials prevent a deep penetration of resin into the
old concrete,
filling materials prevent a penetration of resin into the new
concrete,
filling materials are less expensive than epoxy resin; and
resins with fillers can be placed in thicker layers.
In the latter case, the influence of possible heat development should
be considered.
While considering the epoxy resin as bonding agent, it is essential to
investigate the following aspects :-
-
The components of the resin and their exact formulation in
consultation with the experts.
-
Detailed specifications for the materials and their application
procedure.
-
The
quality acceptance standards and
testing methods
available based on international standards.
-
Sensitivity of the material to temperature, ultra-violet rays and
other external factors.
-
Modulus of elasticity with and without proposed fillers.
and



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 132
======================================================================
59
-
The cost effectiveness of the resin as compared to that of other
materials.
Cementitious based polymer modified materials
are more economical, serve same purpose and sometimes
better than epoxy resins.
(f)
Evaluation and limitations
:
At this stage of development, the evaluation of the use of bonding
agents with regard to their effectiveness and durability is still very difficult.
There
is doubt as
to whether positive properties, presented
in
various
publications, are valid under conditions occuring in practice. Strengths of some
bonding agents are reported to vary, under influence of water or some other
factors also.
Also, long term tests have shown much less strength of some
bonding agents, than with short term tests.
6.1.1.3. Removal of chloride contamination
: There does not exist,
within the current state-of-the-art, any promising method of transforming
penetrated chlorides into insoluble compounds so as to passivate a potential
for corrosion.
Current possible methods (Not yet Introduced in India) of
chloride removal are as follows
:
water treatment
treatment with lime milk,
electro-osmosis; and
mechanical removal of the contaminated concrete layer
It should be pointed out that the efficiency of the first three methods
has not yet been proven, but ongoing research and tests may provide answers
in the future.
6. 1 . 1 .4.
Repair of concrete surfaces
6.1.1.4.1.
Surface protection measures:
A concrete surface
exposed to climatic effects will change its structure and physical appearance
with time. Therefore, the durability of a structural element cannot be assessed
only from the physical appearance of its surface.
Due to the techniques used during construction, the composition of
the surface layers of the concrete are different from the interior of the structural
element, in particular the cement content increases towards the surface. The



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 132
======================================================================
60
concrete surface itself is formed by a "cement film".
It has no aggregates and
depending on external influences, can be eroded.
In addition, when these
boundary layers are removed for aesthetic or visual reasons, changes due to
climatic effects at the uncovered surfaces are to be expected in the course of
time.
However, alterations to the concrete surface, for desired aesthetical
reasons to improve appearance, need not affect the durability of the structural
element. If the concrete is of a proper composition.
If the concrete composition does not correspond
to the external
influences and
further development of an already existing weathering
is of
concern, measures need to be taken to minimise or stop this process.
In both cases, the following surface protection measures can be used:
hydrophobation,
painting,
impregnation,
sealers; and
coatings.
The protection provided by these measures increases
in the order
given above.
The difference
exists
in how
protection
is achieved between
impregnation systems and
sealers and/or coating systems.
Protection
is
achieved
in the impregnation system through a prevention of a capillary
absorption of water by the concrete.
Depending on the material used, this
effect will be achieved by a hydrophobation of the pores at the walls or by a
narrowing of the capillary ducts, which result from a film formation on these
walls.
Sealers or coatings lead to a closed thin film on the surface.
6. 1
. 1 .4.2.
Materials for surface protection measures
(a)
Impregnations, hydrophobations
:
The materials used for impregnations are:
-
silicon organic solutions,
-
resins; and
-
oils.



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 132
======================================================================
61
(i)
Silicon organic impregnation materials are
:
-
siliconates
-
silanes
-
siloxanes and
-
silicon resins.
(ii)
Resins
:
In contrast
to
the
silicon organic impregnation
materials,
the
protection provided by the resins
is mainly derived from a film
formation on
the surface of the pores and a narrowing of
the
capillaries. Types of materials used are:
*
polymethylmetacrylates (PMMA) and
*
epoxy resins.
(iii)
Oils
:
Low molecular, organic compounds in the form of oils may be used
for impregnation. Most experience available is that associated with
linseed oil. Linseed oil may be used in the following forms
:
-
boiled (linseed) oil,
-
linseed stand oil and
-
mixture products of boiled (linseed) oil or
-
linseed stand oil with not more than 15% unsaturated
organic compounds.
(iv)
Technique of application
:
(a) The
efficiency of an impregnation basically depends on
the
preparation of the surface and on the required depth of impregnation.
Requirements for impregnation material are small molecular size and
low viscosity. The absorption is accomplished via the capillary voids
of the concrete.
The proportion of capillary voids increases with
increasing water/cement ratio.
The impregnation liquid must be
placed on the concrete surface in an amount to
fill the voids.
The
application may be accomplished by means of a brush,
lambskin
roller or by spraying.
Depending on the absorptive capacity of the
surface, several repetitions may be necessary. For solvent containing



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 132
======================================================================
impregnation systems, the concentration of the solution during the
first application may recwire thinning to achieve a deeper penetration.
Penetration depth
is especially important where
traffic wear
is
expected.
Therefore, impregnation protection systems are only
suitable where the concrete surface will not be removed by abrasion,
damaged or locally disturbed by the formation of cracks.
While impregnation with
resins may be successfully used on
horizontal surfaces, hydrophobizing impregnations are not suitable
for horizontal
surfaces where water
will
stay on
the
surface.
Therefore,
the primary
field of application of hydrophobizing
impregnations is on vertical or sloped surfaces, where the water can
flow off easily.
(b)
Sealers
:
In contrast to impregnations, a sealer forms a film on
the concrete surface. This can be achieved by increasing the applied
quantity of an impregnation agent, which tends to form a film, or
through the choice of suitable resins.
The following plastics are
commonly used
:
epoxy resins (EP)
polyurethane resins (PU)
polymethylmetacrylate resins (PMMA); and
unsaturated polyester resins (UP)
Sealers can also serve as a primer for coatings
:
(c) Coatings
: Coatings as compared to sealers provide an additional
protection against mechanical influence.
Consideration should also
be given to the fact that coatings, as compared to sealers, have an
increased resistance
to
the diffusion of internal
moisture.
A
differentiation should be made between thin and thick coatings. Thin
coatings, will follow the contour of any unevenness of the surface.
Thick coatings should form as much as possible a plain surface with
a thickness of 1mm or larger. Therefore, a thick coaling will smooth
out any unevenness of the surface.
Requirements of coating materials are as follows
:
resistance against chemical attacks,



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 132
======================================================================
63
resistance against temperature changes,
good adhesion to the surface,
sufficient tensile strength and elasticity,
sufficient abrasive resistance,
capability to bridge cracks; and
coefficient of thermal expansion comparable to that of
concrete.
Plastic modified cement systems and resins are suitable for coatings.
Thick coating of resin mortars, upto thickness of 3mm can be produced by
repeated wet-in-wet application of thin layers. Other coatings suitable for
protection at concrete surfaces are epoxy resin, bituminous compound linseed
oil, silicon preparation, rubber emulsion
or even mere cement coating.
Coatings should also have the capability
to bridge cracks.
This
requires a high elasticity of the coating material. The epoxy systems are known
to change their properties with variations
in temperature and exposure to
sunrays. For thinner layers bridging of cracks can only be achieved when a
limited debonding of the coating adjacent to the crack is possible. With such
coatings, it is possible to bridge cracks upto 0.2mm in width. Bridging of larger
crack widths can be achieved by the insertion of a fibre material into the
coating, e.g. in the form of textile fabrics.
Recently, two component liquid
sealers have been developed which can be sprayed onto the concrete surface.
They have the ability to bridge larger cracks as a result of their low modulus
of elasticity and their improved elongation. Some systems, however, are not
sufficiently resistant to mechanical effects and weathering influences (mostly
UV-rays) and they may require an additional protection layer. They may also
be used as a membrane underneath asphalt overlays.
6. 1 . 1 .4.3.
Replacement of a substantial depth of concrete section
If the deterioration process has reached a level where a shallow
surface repair is not desirable, a replacement of the missing concrete section
should be considered. The technical choice of the repair material depends on
volume to be replaced, the depth of the repair, the loading effects to be expected
and
the conditions of application on
site.
In
all
cases, an appropriate
pre-treatment of surface is required.
The various measures for damage repair may, in addition, require
surface protection measures to provide for the durability of the repair.



======================================================================
PAGE 76 of 132
======================================================================
64
The following materials for the replacement of a substantial depth
loss of the concrete surface should be considered
:
polymer modified, cement-bond systems; and
cement mortar or concrete (normally concrete similar
to
original mix but with reduced water cement ratio is best).
Shotcrete
(gunite):
Shotcrete
is suitable for the repair of surface damages, concrete
replacement and for the strengthening of structural elements.
Pre-treatment of the surface
is of prime importance when using
shotcrete.
Sand blasting has proved
to be an
efficient surface treatment
procedure. However, environmental protection regulations should be verified
before use.
The surface should be sufficiently pre- moistened. No bonding
agent is necessary because at the interface surface, a mortar enrichment occurs
as a result of aggregate rebound.
Shotcreung
in
multiple
layers
requires
that
the preceding
layer
achieves a sufficient degree of hardness.
Minimum reinforcement may be
required for thicknesses larger than 50mm. This reinforcement should be fixed
in position in such a manner that it remains stiff and keeps its position during
shotcreung operations and to ensure adequate cover in the finished works.
Curing may be accomplished by an evaporation
protection,
e.g.
plastic sheet, to prevent a rapid drying out.
If a freeze- thaw/salt resistant
concrete is required, air entrainment admixtures may have to be added to the
concrete mix.
Also, surface protection measures may become necessary.
There are two basic shotcrete processes
:
a dry mix process where most of the mixing water is added
at the nozzle and the cement-sand mixture
is carried by
compressed
air through
the delivery
hose
to a
special
nozzle, and
a wet mix process where all of the ingredients, including
water, are mixed before entering the delivery hose.
Shotcrete
suitable
for normal construction requirements can be
produced by either process.
However,..differences
in cost of equipment,



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 132
======================================================================
65
maintenance and operational
features may make one or
the other more
attractive for a particular application.
Properly applied shotcrete
is a structurally adequate and durable
material and is capable of excellent bond with concrete, masonry, steel and
some other materials. However, these favourable properties are contingent on
proper planning, supervision, skill and continuous attention by the application
crew.
In general, the in-place physical properties of sound shotcrete are
comparable
to those of conventional mortar or concrete having the same
composition.
Special variants of shotcretes result form the addition of fibre or of
synthetic resins.
Steel, glass (boron- silicate-glass) and plastics are used for
the fibres. The ratio of the fibre to cement will be larger in the initial mixture
than in the rebound material.
In the case of steel fibres, corrosion protections
must be considered, unless the fibres are protected from corrosion.
The last
layer must not contain steel fibres.
Removal and Replacement of Concrete
:
This
is considered necessary when
the concrete
is found
to be
delaminated by sounding with hammer or chloride ion content is critical or
micro cracks are found on a chipped surface or concrete is earbonated upto
reinforcement.
The removal of damaged concrete
is
usually done with
electrically powered or compressed air ensuring that the reinforcement is not
damaged.
Rat
chisel is
normally used to minimise micro crack formation
which can cause repair failures.
For
a complete removal of a structural
element larger equipment such as sawing, cracking, thermal lancing and
blasting may also be adopted. Special care needs to be taken while removing
concrete in prestressed concrete structures. Hydro
demolition
is the latest
method where water is sprayed on to the concrete in thin jets at a very high
pressure and enables removing of concrete in a more efficient
and precise
manner without damaging reinforcement and in a better working environment.
The/ replacement of concrete
in
larger continuous areas should
proceed in the same manner as during the construction of the concrete structure.
However, certain features resulting from the combination of old and new
concrete should be considered.



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 132
======================================================================
66
Placing concrete in the area to be repaired should be accomplished in
such a manner as not to impede concrete flow and to avoid the entrapment of
air, thus avoiding voids in the concrete.
Therefore, the formwork must be
sufficiently rigid and tightly fitted to the existing concrete in a manner to
minimize leakage of cement paste. The surface of the existing concrete will
require adequate preparation, careful cleaning and pre- moistening.
The replacement concrete should have final properties that match the
existing concrete as closely as possible (strength, modulus of elasticity, creep
co-efficient, etc.) To avoid temperature and shrinkage cracks, especially in the
transition area, the type of cement, cement content and the water/cement ratio
should be carefully evaluated.
The use of plasticizers is recommended. Recompaction/revibration
may be required to improve the contact to the old concrete, however, care
should be exercised to avoid a retempering of concrete after an initial set. Trial
repairs on non -critical
structures
are
essential
before
the main work
is
undertaken.
For larger concrete volumes, minimizing the temperature difference
between old and new concrete may require special procedure (cooling of new
concrete and/or heating of old concrete). Type and duration of curing should
be evaluated on a case by case basis.
6.1.2.
Repair of Cracks and Other Defects
6.1.2.1. General:
Before deciding
the most appropriate
methods/material for repairing/sealing cracks a determination should be made
on the cause of the cracks and whether they are active or dormant. Crack
activity
(propagation
or breathing) may be determined by periodic
observations with Demec or other movement gauges, optical crack gauges,
fitter gauges or
tell tales. A classification of cracks in accordance with
its
primary cause
is given in the FIP Guide to Good Practice "Inspection and
Maintenance
for
Concrete Structures".
The repairs techniques generally
applicable for the various types of damages, particularly in case of deterioration
of concrete are as follows
:
(a)
Active cracks
:
Caulking, jacketing,
stitching,
stressing, injection.

Repair of cracks becomes necessary when
:
corrosion protection has been compromised, allowing
corrosive agents to reach the reinforcing steel;
the functional use of the structure is compromised;
a
restoration of the
tensile
strength of the concrete
is
structurally desirable, e.g., reduction of the stress range in
prestressing elements through cracked coupling joints;
cracks in longitudinal direction of the reinforcement present
a risk to bond strength; and
a crack free appearance is required.
It is always desirable to attempt repairs to cracks at as early a stage
as possible.
Basically, a crack resulting from one time load application and which
has ceased to propagate can be repaired by pressure injection with epoxy resins



======================================================================
PAGE 80 of 132
======================================================================
68
such that stability is restored and any adverse influence on the life expectancy
of the structure is eliminated or minimized.
In
the case of cracks which
are
the
result of time-dependent
constraints such as shrinkage or settlement, the repair should be delayed as
much as possible, compatible with the use of the structure, such that the effect
of further deformation is minimized. Pressure (not too high to cause damage)
injection of epoxy/cement can still be effective even for an active
crack (a
cyclic opening and closing resulting from temperature changes
or cyclic
loading) where
the objective
is primarily
corrosion
protection of the
reinforcement.
However, if the crack is of a nature to adversely effect the
structural integrity of the structure strengthening will be required prior to crack
repair.
6.1.2.2. Materials: The material used for crack repair must be such
as to penetrate easily into the crack and provide a durable adhesion to the crack
surfaces. The larger the modulus of elasticity of the material, the greater will
be the obtainable adhesion strength.
The interface of the material and the
crack surfaces should be such as not to allow infiltration of water and to resist
all physical and chemical attacks. Currently, the following fluid resins are used
for crack injection
:
epoxy resin (EP),
polyurethane resin (PUR),
acryl resin (PMMA) and
unsaturated polyester resin (UP).
The formulation of commercially available injection
resins vary
widely in their properties, therefore, care must be exercised in making the
proper selection. Important properties of any injection resin is its resistance to
moisture penetration and alkaline attack from the cement.
Where tensile
strength
is a requirement, the tensile strength of the resin should approach mat
of the concrete as closely as possible.
Therefore, a stiff and highly adhesive
resin
is desirable.
These properties are available
in epoxy or unsaturated
polyester resins.
After hardening of the injection material, the "stiffness" of
the crack will be dependent upon the elasticity of the resin.
A polyurethane or acrylic
resin
is recommended where moisture
resistance is a requirement. Epoxy based low viscous resins will penetrate to



======================================================================
PAGE 81 of 132
======================================================================
69
the crack root where the crack width at the surface
is larger than 0.1mm.
Comparable results are obtainable from
unsaturated polyester and
poiyurethane resins. Acrylic resins are capable of sealing fine cracks because
of their low viscosity.
However, in all cases, this requirement can only be
obtained with an appropriately long reaction time.
Fast reactive systems will
only close the crack at its surface.
Although cement paste is relatively inexpensive, its use is limited to
crack widths ofapproximately 3mm or larger because of their limited viscosity.
However fine ground cements allow injection of cracks with widths down to
0.3mm. Cement glues and mortars are of importance in such applications as
injection of voids (honeycombing), sealing of ducts, etc. For these applications
the use of appropriate additives are recommended to improve viscosity and
reduce the tendency
for settlement.
Improvement of workability
will be
obtained if the cement suspension is introduced into the mix with high speed
mixers.
6.1.2.3. Injection
process:
As a
rule,
the following
steps are
necessary during injection
:
drilling of the injection-holes and blowing out of the holes
and cracks,
installation of packers,
tamping of surface in the area of the cracks to be injected,
mixing of the injection material,
injection of the injection material and
re-injection and testing,
(i)
Packer
Packers are auxiliary means by which the injection material is injected
into the crack. Depending on the method of installation, they may be classified
as an adhesive packer, drilling packer or a jet- packer.
Adhesive packers are pasted into the crack. The hose to the injection
device is connected to the nozzle of the adhesive packer. In the case of drilling
packers, holes are drilled in the plane of the crack or may be inclined to the
crack plane. The packer consists of a threaded metal tube which is encased in



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 132
======================================================================
70
a rubber like sleeve and equipped with a nut. After insertion into the drill hole,
the rubber sleeve is compressed by screwing down the nut.
In this manner, the
drill hole is sealed. A nipple, equipped with a ball valve to which the injection
hose is attached, is screwed into the packer opening. The valve opens itself
when subjected to the injection pressure.
(ii)
Injection equipments
Injection equipments are differentiated as one- component or two-
component equipments.
In the case of one-component equipment, the resin is
mixed first and subsequently injected into the crack.
Typical representative
one-component equipments are a hand grease gun, treadle press, air-pressure
tank, high-pressure tank and a hose pump. With these equipments, rather high
pressures can be applied.
However, the influence of the applied pressure on
the packer, the tamping and the crack itself should be considered. The pot life
of the material is an important parameter in the application of one-component
equipments.
Therefore, the length of crack that can be injected is subject to
the volume of material being used and its pot life.
In the case of two-component equipments, resin and hardener are
separately
transported
to
the mixing head by means of fully automatic
dispensing equipment.
Therefore, pot life is only of secondary importance.
Errors in mixing two-component resins can have significant effect on the
hardening of the resin.
Therefore, the use of pre-packaged batches prepared
by
the manufacturer
is recommended.
Generally,
in
the case of two-
component automatic dosing devices errors will not be discovered in sufficient
time to apply corrective measures.
(iii)
Injection
A distinction must be made between low-pressure injection (upto
approximately 2.0 MPa) and high pressure injection (upto 30 MPa).
The
penetration speed of the injection resin does not increase proportionately with
increasing pressure. The viscosity of the resin strongly influences the rate of
injection, especially for small crack widths and in the area of the crack root.
The injection of a crack is completed when either the resin or hardener
has been consumed from either of the containers or a back pressure has built
up in such a manner that no further material can be injected into the crack.
For the low pressure process, the resin has a relatively greater amount
of time to penetrate gently into the crack. Because the injected resin may flow



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 132
======================================================================
71
from the main crack into fine capillaries, a post-injection procedure may
become necessary.
This will be especially true for high- pressure injection.
Therefore,
it must be accomplished prior
to hardening of the previously
injected resin.
Flow capacity and hardening reaction of the resin is dependent on
temperature.
This factor must be considered for cold structural elements and
for declining ambient temperatures. High
resin temperatures
shorten
the
processing time in one- component equipments. For crack widths upto 0.2mm,
a thick sealing at the cracked surface with a resin is usually sufficient.
It will
be absorbed by capillary action in the crack. For epoxy injection of cracks see

6. 1 .2.4. Testing The usual testing methods are drill core removal and
ultrasonic
testing.
In
special
cases,
efficiency can be determined by
measurement of steel extension or the deformation of the structural element
before and after injection under selected test loads or by determining the
influence line.
(i)
Coring
The success of an
injection operation can be determined by a
relatively simple procedure of removing cores taken through the crack plane.
Because of the unavoidable damag 3 to the structural element such evaluations
should only be used in exceptional cases.
However, they are meaningful as
preparatory evaluation, e.g. determining crack depth.
(ii)
Ultrasonics
With ultrasonic measuring, the efficiency of the groutng operation
can only be evaluated when the propagation of sound is oriented approximately
normal to the crack
surface. It is recommended that during ultrasonic testing,
data be gathered not only with regard to the elapsed time for the sound to pass
through the member, but also to variations in sound intensity.
The measurement with
the
existing equipments and methods
is
however not easy to be carried out and the results cannot be interpreted yet
reliably.
6.1.2.5. Recommendations for practical implementation:
Adequate materials, equipment and experience of the operating personnel are
a essential requirement for the successful injection of cracks. Appropriate
certification
is necessary
to determine
the qualifications of operating
personnel.
A system of quality control of the resin should be implemented to
guarantee a consistent quality
for each new
application. These are
:
the
determination of the infrared composition (IR- Spectrum), the pot life, the
viscosity,
the density,
the
glass
transition temperature as well as
the
development of the
tensile
strength during hardening and
the hardened
material. To avoid such expensive routine controls,some resin manufacturers
have contracted with independent institutions to provide testing on a statistical
sampling basis as a monitoring
control. After successful testing,the resin
batches are provided with a stamp of the testing institute as well as with
information regarding durability. Stringent regulations for the use of resins
'



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 132
======================================================================
73
crack repair, especially where they must resist tensile stresses, is required to
insure the behaviour of structural elements and to avoid additional damage that
might be caused by the utilization of inadequate materials and procedures.
Studies have shown that injection with epoxy resins can be successfully
accomplished.
No reliable data or appropriate evaluations are currendy available for
polyurethane and acrylic resins, that might be used as a crack repair material.
This partially results from clients requiring epoxy resins even when other resins
might be more appropriate.
A reduction of adhesive strength will occur when the concrete surface
of a crack is excessively moist. There is also a risk of a reduction in the quality
of epoxy resins when they are used for the repair of structural elements at
extreme temperatures. Current experience indicates that epoxy resins can be
succesfully utilized when the temperature of the structural element is not less
than 8°C. Because of the lack of experience with other resins (e.g. PUR) the
8°C limit should be maintained. Acrylic resins are an exception, they harden
at temperatures below the freezing point.
For relatively
hot
structural elements, as compared
to normal
temperatures, a considerable reduction in the workability time of the resins
may result. In these cases, the temperature of the structural element in relation
to its influence on the pot life should be considered and previous testing may
be appropriate.
In many cases, only one side of the structural element to be injected
is economically accessible. Experience has shown that one-sided injection of
a through crack in a large structural element or deep cracks are not always
uniformly filled.
An effective epoxy resin injection can
still be accomplished when
there is a cyclic width variation, as a result of traffic loading, during injection
and hardening, provided this variation does not exceed 0.05mm. Appropriate
traffic
limitations, upto maximum of the
first three days depending on
temperature should be implemented if larger cyclic crackwidth variations are
anticipated. In the case of large
crack width, variations
resulting
from
temperature injection should be co-ordinated such that hardening commences
at maximum crackwidth opening. Thus, the filled crack will be subjected to a
compressive stress, atleast for temperature variations. Experience indicates



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 132
======================================================================
74
that
there is no difference in behaviour between an alkaline or carbonized
concrete.
The deformability of the resin, as a rule, is not sufficient to close active
cracks tightly and durably in case these movements cannot be stopped. Under
these circumstances the
feasibility of expanding the crack and forming a
permanent expansion joint should be explored.
6.1.2.6.
Other methods are
:
(a)
Stitching
-
Stitching across the cracks by in-situ reinforced
concrete is done either along the cracks or as a series of bands
around the members.
Reinforcement is placed across
the
cracks in suitable grooves which are suitably packed with wet
concrete gunited.
Alternatively,
if geometry permits, bars
grouted
in holes could be used for stitching.
(b)
Jacketing
: This involves fastening of external material over
the concrete
to provide
the required performance
characteristics and restoring
the
structural value.
The
jacketing materials are secured to concrete by means of bolts
and adhesives or by bond with existing concrete. Fibre glass
reinforced plastics, ferrocement and polypropelyne can also
be used for jacketing.
6.1.2.7.
Prestressed concrete members
:
For PSC members, the
simple methods adopted are sealing and coating to fill out the cracks, grouting
of cracks, repairing corrosion locations, and vacuum grouting using specially
formulated resins to
fill voids in the ducts.
Some of the latest techniques
include use of special chemical
material formulations
to
satisfy
the
requirements like high tensile strength, special thermal properties etc. Some
of the methods are common to those for RCC and the relevant details given
earlier may be referred.
.
6. 1 .3
Corrosion Protection of Steel Reinforcement
6.1.3.1
General
The embedment of reinforcing steel in concrete normally provides
adequate corrosion protection due to the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding
the steel.
Because of its alkalinity, concrete forms a passivating film on the
surface of the encapsulated steel as a result of the presence of a saturated lime



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 132
======================================================================
75
solution in the cement gel. Moist concrete typically has a pH value in excess
o f
12 which maintains
the passivating
film.
This
film
is however
de-passivated when the pH level is reduced below a value of approximately 10
to
11, or when a sufficiendy high chloride concentration of about 0.4%
chloride by weight of cement is present.
In case the alkaline passivation film is destroyed or carbonization has
reached the reinforcement or if moisture and oxygen are present, corrosion of
the reinforcement will occur. In the absence of moisture (i.e. dry concrete) the
corrosion process is inhibited, even if the concrete is carbonated, wetting and
drying cycles increase corrosion.
When reinforcement corrodes to a certain extent, the surrounding
concrete cover tends to crack and spall or
split. The cracks are caused by
internal bursting
stresses developing in the concrete as a result
of
a
net
increase
in volume by the formation of corrosion products.
Spalling of the
concrete cover
will then permit
the
entry of water and other corrosion
accelerating agents and the rate of corrosion accelerates. Non-expansive black
rust associated with severe pitting and rapid corrosion can occur in low oxygen
wet high chloride conditions in salted bridge decks, substructure and marine
structures.
N.B. When the deterioration is localised in steel it is worth repairing it. But once overall
deterioration sets in, it is better to replace or strengthen when safety is at risk.
6.1.3.2
Protection of reinforcing steel
(i)
Preparation prior to protection
The decision on the necessity of removal of chloride contaminated
concrete cover, where commencement of the corrosion process is imminent,
will depend upon the amount of chloride content, availability of moisture and
degree of carbonation. This decision requires a case by case evaluation.
If the
corrosion
protection
of the reinforcing
steel requires removal,
the
reinforcement will have to be exposed completely.
The removal of rust from the uncovered reinforcing steel is generally
accomplished by sand-blasting devices, needle hammer and wire brushing.
The removal of rust from the remote side of the bar is a difficult operation. A
careful check and a repeated treatment of the individual bars is essential.



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 132
======================================================================
76
(ii)
Restoration of the protection
A corrosion protection should be applied to the cleaned reinforcement
prior to restoration of the concrete cover. If possible, the reinforcing bar should
be encapsulated in an alkaline coating, i.e. cementatious bond coat. This can
be achieved best by a cement-bond repair mortar.
In addition, measures have
to be implemented such
that
this active corrosion protection
will not be
compromised again by carbonization, spalling or by corrosive agents reaching
the level of the reinforcement.
The restoration of the corrosion protection system of the reinforcing
steel can be accomplished by the following means
:
concrete,
cement mortar or
concrete or cement mortar with polymers.
The choice of the system depends on the thickness of concrete cover.
Concrete or cement mortar can be used if the concrete cover can be achieved
in accordance with appropriate regulations. In cases where less than adequate
thickness of cover is obtainable, polymer modified materials give adequate
resistance. The Central Electro Chemical Research
Institute (CECRI)
at
Karaikudi has developed a process for protecting the rebars from corrosion and
the same has been described in IS 9077-1979. The Director, CECRI, Karaikudi
could be approached for more details. Development of fusion bonded epoxy
coated reinforcement is also in progress.
(iii)
Preventive corrosion protection
In the case where concrete cover is thin it may be desirable to seal the
surface with an epoxy resin and solvent containing acrylic resins to prevent
carbonization or corrosion.
(iv)
Cathodic protection
The cathodic
protection (CP) technique has been adopted
in
developed countries to protect steel pipe lines and tanks from corrosion. In
recent years it has been applied experimentally for the protection of reinforcing
steel in concrete.

Corrosion of
steel
in concrete proceeds by
the formation of an
electro-chemical cell.
With the concrete acting as coupling electrolyte, an
anodic reaction occurs
at some points on
the
steel
surface and cathodic
reactions consume the dissolved electrons on the remaining portion of the steel
surface.
The presence of chloride ions will produce a local de- passivation.
By means of an externally applied small direct current (DC) the electric
potential between the steel and concrete is shifted to a non-critical level. Thus,
the electrons impressed in the steel force the steel to act as a cathode in the
electro-chemical cell. The potential shift produced by the DC is critical to the
cathodic protection. Because of the high resistivity of the electrolyte concrete,
a uniform distribution of the protection current throughout the structure
is
necessary.
But difficulties in achieving this and high costs have prevented
cathodic protection being widely used in bridge decks and superstructures.
However, research continues.
It is accepted that there
is
still research required to be done before
cathodic protection can be safely applied to prestressing steel. (Table 6.1)
6.1.4.
Prestressing steel protection
6. 1 .4.1
. General
: This section deals only with the possible repair of
protection to prestressed reinforcement.
It should, however be noted that the
repair of the concrete and the normal reinforcement of a prestressed concrete
structure will also require attention.
In most cases, the prestressing force is
still active and the stresses
transferred
to the concrete must be carefully
considered, especially when repairing concrete in the anchorage zones.
Repair of the corrosion protection systems for bonded tendons
In
the case of bonded tendons,
the prestressing
steel should be
protected by the concrete cover and the cement grout in the ducts.
(a)
Vacuum-procedure
Where
the ducts are not completely
filled
with cement
grout,
subsequent grouting
is necessary.
This can be accomplished by vacuum
grouting techniques. The advantage of this procedure is that die rcgrouting of
a duct requires only one drilled hole
for each
void.
Such holes may be
pre-existing in the form of the drilled holes used for tendon inspection or for
obtaining samples for chloride content evaluation. Only a diameter adjustment

may be required. A comparison between the assessed volume of the void and
the amount of grout consumed will provide a control measure as to the success
of the operation. Where discrepancies occur further borings will be required.
A careful drilling procedure is required to avoid damaging of the prestressing
steel.
Special devices and techniques have been developed for this purpose,
such as
: slow drilling speed, special drill head, small impact force, drilling
without flushing, sucking away of drilling dust and automatic switch off when
the drill bit reaches the duct. The repair must be accomplished as quickly as
possible after opening of the duct to avoid corrosion.



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 132
======================================================================

After grouting, a pressure has to be applied to expel residual air from
the voids. There is a
risk
that
for large air cushions, setting water will be
displaced towards defects and produce paths which will impair the corrosion
protection.
Therefore, mortar with low setting characteristics should be used.
Special cements are available for this purpose.
In special cases, surplus water in the duct can be evacuated. However,
mis process requires special equipment and knowledge.
(b)
Grouting of the ducts with special resins
Where ducts filled with water cannot be drained through drilling or
the vacuum process and drying
is not possible, the water can be displaced by
use of viscous epoxy resins with a long pot life and high specific weight.
Repair of corrosion protection systems for external tendons
The prestressing
steel of external tendons
is protected by a tight
envelope of plastic pipe or painted steel pipe and the internal void of the pipe
is filled with cement grout or suitable greases.
If an inspection indicates
deterioration of the protection system, measures must be taken for
its re-
establishment. Such measures may be re-painting of steel ducts and protective
caps over the anchorages, replacing of plastic pipes, tapping of local pipe
damage, filling of voids inside the pipes etc.
Any materials used in the repair procedure must be compatible with
the
existing
protection
materials and with
the prestressing
steel.
Some
paintings, coating
materials
and. special grouting mortars might contain
substances that
can
produce
stress corrosion and should, therefore not be
used.
6.1.5.
Honeycombed concrete
There are two methods of sealing
: either the porous parts of the
concrete are replaced by sound, watertight concrete or the porous zones are
injected with a sealing material.
First, all the porous zones of the structure
must be carefully removed.
Then they are replaced by
fully compacted
concrete or mortar with a water/cement ratio not exceeding 0.4. This procedure
cannot be used where there is a continuing inflow of water. In this case, sealing
can be accomplished by injection.

6.2.
Strengthening
of Concrete Structures
6.2.1.
General
:
Strengthening
oi
1
structural members can be
achieved by
:
replacing poor quality or defective material by better quality
material,
providing additional load bearing material, and
re-distribution
of the
loading
actions
through imposed
deformation of the structural system.
The new load bearing material will usually be
:
high quality concrete
reinforcing steel bars,
thin steel plates and straps,
post-tensioning tendons, or
various combinations of these materials.
The main problem in strengthening is to achieve compatibility and a
continuity in the structural behaviour between the original material/structure
and the new material/repaired structure.
(a)
the strengthening part of the structure participates only under
live load and
(b)
the strengthening part of the structure participates under iive
and dead load (or a part of it).
It may be
noted
that
these
strengthening measures improve
the
strength but not necessarily the durability of the original structure.
6.2.2.
Design
aspects
: The strengthening of structures should be
designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate codes.
If special
codes for
strengthening exist, they
will
of course be of
assistance to the
designers and
contractors.
However,
this
is seldom
the case, and many
problems in connection with strengthening are not dealt with in the codes.
Typical problems of this kind are the transfer of shear forces between the old



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 132
======================================================================
81
concrete and the new concrete applied for strengthening reinforcement,and the
post-tensioning of the existing structure which in some respects is different
from the post-tensioning of a new structure,etc.
6.2.3.
Interaction between new and old concrete:
Satisfactory
interaction between existing concrete and new concrete is generally required
in strengthening and repair.
As a rule, the aim
is to get the structural parts,
composed of different concretes, to act as a homogeneously cast structural
component. To achieve this, the joint between the old concrete and the new
concrete must be capable of transferring
shear
stresses without
relative
movements of such a magnitude that the
static behaviour
is significantly
affected. Furthermore,
the joint must be durable
for the environment
in
question, i.e.
, the composite structural component must not change its mode
of action with time.
When using large concrete vermes, the possibility of additional
stresses as a result of hydration heat has to be taken into account. Temperature
differences can be limited by special measures, e.g., pre-hcating of the old
structural element and/or cooling of the freshconcrete.
Differences in creep and shrinkage properties between old and new
structural elements will require careful evaluation. Cracks may develop as a
result of potential
increases
in
constraint
forces. Therefore
it becomes
necessary to correctly detail and anchor the reinforcement. To implement the
strengthening measures,
it will be necessary to employ suitable mortars or
concretes with low creep and shrinkage properties
as well
as minimal
development of hydration heat. At the same time, an effort should be made to
match, as closely as possible, the strength and modulus of elasticity of the new
material with that of the old material. These requirements will be influenced
to a large extent by the composition and treatment of the new material.
Vibrations due to traffic during hardening of the new concrete will
have either negative influence or positive influence on its strength and its bond
characteristics to the old concrete. This will depend on whether the vibrations
are just sufficient to harden the concrete or too severe to disturb the components
of hardened concrete and its bond. In case it is observed that vibrations do not
have any negative influence then the traffic could be permitted in a controlled
manner while the repairs are in progress. However,
if the vibrations due to
traffic have negative influence then stoppage of traffic or speed limits may
have to be considered during the hardening phase as necessary. The critical
phase may be 3 to 14 hours after making the concrete. The formwork should



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 132
======================================================================
82
be so detailed that no relative movement occurs between old & new concrete.
The
reinforcement has
to be sufficiently fastened so as
to keep relative
displacement small.
6.2.4.
Strengthening of the reinforcement: The strengthening of
reinforcement subject to tensile forces can be achieved by
:
replacing of reinforcement severly damaged by corrosion;
additional reinforcement;
*
placed in the old cross section
*
placed in an additional concrete layer;
prestressing; and
epoxy bonded steel plates.
6.2.4.1 . Strengthening with reinforcing bars
: In the simplest case,
a strengthening of the concrete tension zone is possible by the addition of
reinforcing steel.
Reinforcement should be added after reducing locked up
stresses to the extent possible and after the concrete cover has been removed
or after recesses have- been cut
in the cover
to accommodate the added
reinforcement.
Afterwards the concrete cover must be re- established. An
effective anchoring of the ends of tfie reinforcing steel is required. This can
either be done by providing sufficient
anchorage length for the steel in the
concrete, or by steel plates and bolts with anchoring discs.
In special cases, severly damaged reinforcing bars must be replaced.
After unloading of the smicture, the damaged sections of the corroded bar can
be removed and the new reinforcing bar joined to the ends of the old ones by
lapped splices, welding, or coupling devices.
Transverse reinforcement is
needed to assure a ductile behaviour of the splice.
Staggering of lapped splices is recommended unless the distance of
the bars is greater than twelve times the diameter of the bars.
Lapped
splices
in a
structural element can produce problems
(congestion, interference with the proper compaction of concrete etc.) These
difficulties may be overcome by the use of welded splices or couplers.

83
6.2.4.2. Strengthening by means of epoxy bonded steel plates
:
The strengthening of concrete
structures by means of bonded plates
is a
technology adopted
in many countries.
(a)
Short-term behaviour
The load carrying capacity of this type of strengthening depends on
the strength of the reinforcement, the concrete and the adhesive.
At yielding
of the reinforcement
the adhesive
will
fail.
Utilization of high
strength
reinforcement is limited by the dimensions, concrete strength, etc.
Concrete
strength has a large influence on the efficiency of the strengthening since the
failure plane is located within the concrete.
Theoretically, higher bond stress is to be expected from an increase
in the elasticity of the reinforcing element and a decrease in die elasticity of
the adhesive.
Geometrical
influences
are primarily
the dimensions of the
reinforcing elements.
Their length, thicknesses and widths are decisive. The
length of these elements has an influence on the bond stress intensity, which
decreases with length.
The bond stress will at the same time be influenced by the thickness.
Therefore, glued on reinforcing elements behave differently from deformed
bars which can be designed using the same permissible bond stress for all
diameters. There is no proportionality between the width of the glued element
and ultimate load, as an increase of width results in a reduction of bond strength.
For a certain ratio of width to thickness die glued surface becomes a minimum.
With increasing
width, there
is a
risk of defects
in the adhesive.
Therefore,
the width of
the
reinforcing clement should be
limited
to
a
maximum of 200mm.
The thickness of the adhesive coat, within a range of 0.5 to 5mm., has
no
significant
influence on
ultimate
load.
With
increasing
thickness of
adhesive the slip between the reinforcing element and the concrete becomes
greater. The concrete dimensions, according to previous tests, do not appear
to have any decisive effect. The surface condition of the steel
is an important
parameter.
Suitable conditions can be achieved by sand blasting.
Oil and
grease should be removed by means of an organic solvent. As cleaned surfaces
corrode rapidly, a primer coating should be applied immediately. This primer
serves as a corrosion protection and as an adhesive base for an epoxy resin



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 132
======================================================================
84
adhesive.
It is a specially formulated solvent containing epoxy resin. Priming
with zinc dust or hot-dip galvanizing is not suitable for glued on reinforcing
elements.
For the pre-treatment of the concrete
surface,
the procedures
discussed earlier apply.
Blasting with fine grained blasting materials has
proven to be effective (minimum pull-off strength
1.5 N/sq.mm.).
Coarse
grained blasting materials will achieve a deeper roughening of the concrete
surface, which
results
in an
increased consumption of adhesive, but not
necessarily in an improvement of bond strength.
(b)
Long-term behaviour
The question of long term behaviour is of particular importance for
these
materials,
the properties of which
are highly
time- dependent. Of
considerable importance are
:
creep
ageing and
fatigue strength.
(i)
Creep
The creep of epoxy resin adhesives is considerably greater than for
concrete.
In accordance with the current state-of-the-art,
it can be
assumed that the creep deformation abates relatively quickly.
The
adhesives may have very different creep ratios.
In thin adhesive
layers upto 3mm the influence of creep is restricted by the cohesion
of the adhesive.
(ii)
Ageing
Ageing is a change of properties resulting from mechanical, physical
and chemical influences; e.g. air humidity, radiation, heat, weathering
and water.
Ageing varies widely between various adhesives.
For
strengthening of metal elements, ageing reduces strength such that
the long-term strength is only approximately 50% of the short-term
strength.
For strengthening of concrete,
a more favourable
relationship
exists,
as
the adhesive coating
will be loaded
considerably less.



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 132
======================================================================
85
Epoxy resin adhesives have a certain porosity, which will allow the
penetration of water and other solutions. Exposure to water over long
periods of time can cause epoxy resin adhesives to lose strength.
Water sensitivity varies widely between various adhesives.
(iii)
Fatigue strength
Preliminary tests show that the fatigue strength is approximately 50%
of the short- term strength. This indicates that concrete with glued on
reinforcement shows a more favourable behaviour than those for
glued metal structures, for which the dynamic strength for 10 millions
load cycles is only 10% of the static strength.
After a dynamic load
has been applied, the static ultimate strength of the concrete structure
with glued on reinforcement increases. This can be explained through
a reduction of the bond stress peaks as a result of dynamic load.
(c)
Behaviour at failure
The slip between the reinforcing element and concrete under tensile
load has an approximately linear elastic behaviour upto about half of the
ultimate strength and will be influenced by the dimensions of the reinforcing
element and the adhesive layer. A further increase in the load leads
to a
progressive increase of the relative displacement.
The elastic deformations
result from the deformation of the adhesive layer. This slip starts at the loaded
end of the reinforcing element and moves, with increasing load, to the centre
of the element.
In
the
plastic range, a
slip deformation
in
the concrete
sub-surface also occurs. The slip in the concrete develops some millimeters
below the adhesive coat. A failure occurs suddenly, by abrupt elongation of
the slip interface upto the end of the reinforcing element.
In correctly designed structures with bonded plate reinforcement, a
ductile failure with yielding reinforcement can be attained. Bolting on of plates
to prevent pealing failures is now normally accepted in some countries.
It should however, be kept in mind that strengthening with steel plates
with epoxy is a very workmanship sensitive method and so operations have to
be under expert guidence only.

6.2.4.3
Strengthening with supplementary prestressing
:
(a)
General
In many cases, strengthening by means of supplementary prestressing
is
a highly
effective method.
Both
reinforced concrete and prestrcssed
concrete structures can be strengthened by this method. The influence of the
supplementary prestressing on serviceability and ultimate limit states can be
varied within wide limits by selecting different methods of introducing the
tensioning force and using different alignments of the tendon.
(b)
Choice of system for supplementary prestressing
For supplementary prestressing, so far only post- tensioning systems
have been developed. As for normal applications in prestrcssed concrete, post-
tensioning systems should comply with the requirements of the IRC codes for
Acceptance and Applications of Post-Tcnsioning Systems.
Both unbonded
and bonded tendons can be used.
If short prestressing elements are required,
a post- tensioning system with minimal slipping in the anchorage (anchor set)
should be chosen.
Short prestressing elements can be sensitive to deviations
due to construction tolerances (eccentricity, inclination and tolerance of the
anchorage elements, the prestressing jack, etc..)
The use of lower strength higher ductility threaded bars for partial
prestrcss could be considered as a more robust, simple and durable approach
to avoid the very high local anchorage loads and durability problems with
prestressing tendons.
At deviation points (saddles) excessively small radii of curvature in
the tendon should be avoided
(c)
Special design considerations
The strengthening by means of post-tensioning can normally be
designed as an
ordinary
prestrcssed member. When
calculating
prestrcss
losses, however, it should be noted that the effect of creep and shrinkage may
generally be less than in normal design, due to the age of the old concrete. The
stress in an unbonded tendon in the ultimate stale will be only slightly larger
than that after prcstress losses.



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 132
======================================================================
87
(d)
Protection against corrosion and fire
The post-tensioning tendons should be protected against corrosion
and fire to the same extent as in a newly built structure.The requirements for
concrete cover are the same as for ordinary prestressed concrete structures.
(e)
Anchorages and deflectors
Since the post- ten sioncd tendons arc not embedded in the structure in
the conventional manner special attention must be given as to how the
force
is introduced. The space requirements of the anchorage and the prestressing
device should be taken into consideration. When strengthening an existing
structure,
it
is
not generally
possible
to provide
spalling
or
bursting
reinforcement behind the anchorages in the same manner as for a prestressed
concrete
structure.
Spalling can be prevented by means of transverse
prestressing. This prestressing has the further function of creating contact
pressure between new and original concrete, such that the necessary shear
stresses can be transferred through the joint. To ensure full interaction between
the tendons and the rest of the structure, the same method can be used along
the enure beam. but the required shear stress is often so small that it can be dealt
with by means of non-tensioned reinforcement. Another method could be to
locate the anchorages in compressive zone and design the anchor plates for a
suitably reduced bearing stress.
There are several methods available for the
attachment of supplementary prestressing:
(i)
Anchorage at girder ends (abutment) (Fig 6.2).
The advantage of this system is that introduction of concentrated local forces into the
existing structure apart from the abutment is avoided. But it has the disadvantage that all tendons
have to nin from one abutment to the other.

elements at the end of the girder



======================================================================
PAGE 100 of 132
======================================================================
88
(ii) Additional supports,either in concrete or steel, fixed to the web
of the box girder, (Fig 6.3).
This method provides a good
distribution
for
the
force
in
the
supplementary tendons, but creates high stresses locally where the prestressing
force is introduced. Because of the very short transverse dowels the fixation
of the tendon supports or brackets can be a problem.
Fig. 6.3 Additional Supports
(iii)
Anchorages at existing diaphragms,
(Fig. 6.4 & 6.5).
Existing diaphragms require extensive coring such that the tendon can
pass through the diaphragm and be anchored at the backside. If the diaphragm
does not have sufficient capacity to transmit the prestressing force, it may be
necessary
to provide a
structural
steel frame
to
transfer the longitudinal
prestressing force (Fig.6.6).
(iv)
Deflectors or deviation saddles (Fig.6.7).
Where a polygonal profile
is used, deviation saddles or deflectors
have to be provided to achieve the profile. These devices can be either concrete
or
steel.
They
are attached
to
the existing webs or flanges by
short
perestressing bolts or other type of anchors. These short bolts or dowels are
very sensitive to anchorage seating losses. A large radius of tendon curvature
should be used.

6.2.4.4. Strengthening with prefabricated r.c. or p.c. elements
:
Strengthening is also possible by adding precast elements.
This method will
require a destressing (unloading) of the original cross section. The composite
cross section of precast elements and the original concrete is then restressed
(loaded).
This provides an improved transmission
of prestress
force
throughout the composite section. With time a re-distribiuuon of permanent
load will occur as a result of creep and shrinkage.
This strengthening method requires bond between the two structural
elements at their interface.
As a rule, a resin modified cement bond mortar
layer is utilized. An epoxy resin mortar can also be used.
For treatment of the contact surface of the
structure,
the same
operations as described earlier are necessary.
In the fabrication of the precast elements, consideration should be
given to the texture of the contact surface so as to provide increased bonding
and shear characteristics at the interface. A sufficiently rough surface of the
precast element can be obtained when the formwork of the contact surface is
treated with a retarder. By early removal of the formwork and cleaning with
water, a washed concrete surface can be achieved. A reduction of the largest
grain size
in the concrete on
this surface
is beneficial.
Sufficient curing
prevents micro-cracks between
mortar and aggregates resulting from
shrinkage. To roughen the surface, sand blasting is also suitable.
If no
special measures are taken during
fabrication,
the contact
surfaces of the precast elements have to bp treated like that of the original
structure.
6.2.4.5. Strengthening by imposed deformation
:
By means of
imposed deformation, overstressed sections of a structure can be partially
relieved.
With
this
the load carrying capacity of the whole
structure
is
improved. A self-equilibrated stress condition can be induced in the structure
by relative displacement (raising and/or lowering) of the supports or by the
introduction of new intermediate supports.
It is important to note that relieving some sections of the structure will
increase action effects (bending moment, shear, torsion) in other sections. A
strengthening of these sections may be required.
Another important factor is
time:
relative settlement of the supports, shrinkage and creep of the old

structure and the new supporting elements will influence the distribution of the
actions-effects in the structure.
6.2.4.6. Strengthening by other methods
: Concrete slabs or beams
or columns
(piers) can be strengthened by providing reinforced concrete
jackets or overlays. Normally, thickness of new concrete layer should be less
than about l/3rd
of the thickness of existing concrete.
Proper attention to
bonding and detailing of shear connections needs to be given.
Replacement of structural system or addition of new systems to the
existing structure are also sometimes adopted to rehabilitate or strengthen a
structure.
In such cases, the existing internal stresses in the members must be
carefully analysed.
Structural alterations could also be considered to reduce excessive
vibrations.

7. REPAIRS TO EXPANSION JOINTS, BEARINGS,
FOOTPATHS AND RAILINGS
7.1.
Introduction
Operational life of expansion joints, bearings, footpaths and railings
is usually shorter than that of the bridge.
The expansion joints, bearings,
railings, parapets etc., need special attention for repairs and replacements or
renewal. The strength and efficiency of bearings may be a limiting factor in
situations where it is required to increase the load carrying capacity of a bridge.
7.2.
Expansion Joints
The expansion joints are not expected to last throughout the life of
the bridge.
It is, therefore, recommended that joints be replaced on a regular
cycle. Maintenance as well as replacement of the joints will have to continue
in future as well.
However, there are indications that the elastomeric joints
presently being installed perform better and give more satisfactory service than
the previous generation joints. The need for further improvement is generally
acknowledged.
It is vital to keep the joints watertight in order to prevent the ill-effects
of moisture including
corrosion on
the beam
ends, bearing
shelves and
substructure. Leaks must not be tolerated. It is not uncommon for joints to be
watertight under the roadway but allow water to leak through at the kerb. Any



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 132
======================================================================
96
replacement joint should be watertight across the full width of the deck, kerb,
footpath, central verge, etc.
Where water tight joints cannot be provided, or where frequent failure
is likely, adequate means of draining the water passing through the joints shall
be provided. As far as possible, the water should be kept out of contact with
the concrete, and the bearings. This is sometimes difficult to realise. If these
measures fail, regular maintenance of the bearings and pedestals will atleast
prevent water from damaging the concrete. Joints may be filled with a sealant
or filler. The filler material must be designed to ensure water tightness. Debris
may prevent joint movement if the filler fails and may damage the joint sides
or joint material, it may
spall the sides of jointed slabs or cause over-stress in
other bridge elements. Debris also tend to retain moisture and hence contribute
to the deterioration of adjacent bridge component.
Some early bridges may not have adequate clearances for extreme
temperature ranges.
Damage to finger type joints may manifest in the form of bent,
cracked or broken fingers, as a result of traffic damage, closure of gaps and
jamming due to
traffic or movement of bituminous wearing course, poor
alignment, loose
anchorage etc. The fingers may also cave in or project up
due to unacceptable deformation
of the
deck or differential settlement of
foundation. Cracking and spalling of the pavement or deck in the area adjacent
to the joint may cause
subsequent failure of the joint by loosening the joint
side support material.
Joints can also get closed in balanced cantilever type
bridges due to excessive deflection of cantilever or excessive hogging of main
span.
Movement of abutment must also be considered when inspecting
joints.
Such movement may either increase or decrease the joint opening or
may even close the joint opening completely, preventing free expansion of the
bridge.
All damaged joints should be replaced.
The sealant filler shall be
replaced periodically.
Cracked concrete in the zone of anchoring the joints
shall be replaced.
Periodic cleaning and removal of debris is a must.



======================================================================
PAGE 109 of 132
======================================================================
97
7.3.
Bearings
Most bearings will not outlast the bridge.
Hence replacement of
defective or damaged bearings shall be provided
for.
However, careful
inspection and periodic maintenance of bearings can extend their service life.
Defective bearings may be due to
:
manufacture, defective materials,
inadequate design,
inadequate or improper installation,
negligent maintenance.
The type of defect may be one or more of the following
:
Corrosion,
defective seal in neoprene/pot bearings,
broken guides,
cracked or broken rollers, plates,
cracks, splits or tears in neoprene material,
accumulation of dirt/debris at the bearing
point,
failure of anchorage system,
movement or creep of parts out of place,
partial contact of bearing plates,
excessive tilt or even shift.
Appropriate corrective action
shall be taken
after detailed
investigation of the defects. Repair or replacement of bearings requires traffic
restrictions or even temporary suspension of traffic.
Excessive
tilts
in
bearings
like segmental
bearings should be
corrected in time.
This can be done by lifting the superstructure, shifting the
bottom or top plates or extending the plates and lowering
the superstructure.
The cracked or excessively deformed elastomeric bearings also need to be



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 132
======================================================================
98
replaced. This requires lifting of the superstructure.
Lifting is normally done
with flat jacks, but where superstructure is very heavy, cranes may have to be
used.
In all events of lifting, checking the design of superstructure for stresses
induced due to lifting is obligatory. These
specialised activities shall only be
undertaken by specialist agencies.
7.4.
Footpaths
As per the prevailing practice until recently, the footpaths have been
constructed either in-situ or using precast slabs with a gap between the top of
deck slab and soffit of the footpath slab. The common distress noted in either
case during the service life is in the form of cracks.
In addition many other
precast slab components are also found displaced or missing. The kerb line,
footpath/deck joint area is particularly sensitive to deterioration and should be
checked.
The cracks shall be repaired by injecting either cement grout or epoxy
as appropriate
after
detailed
investigations. The broken/missing precast
panels shall be replaced with panels of better designs and strength. It may also
be appropriate to provide a mastic topping over the cracked precast slabs.
Where major replacements of precast planks is envisaged, it may be
desirable to revise the design and provide for solid in-situ footpath slab.
7.5.
Railings or Parapets
The repair
measures for these will be same as are to be done for
similar items of which these railings or parapets are made of. A decision to
repair or replace these items should be taken keeping in view the economics
and importance of appearance of the bridge.
Corrosion of holding down bolts on railing
is a particular problem
that should be watched.
8. HYDRAULIC ASPECTS
8.1.
This Chapter has been introduced mainly to focus attention of
the bridge engineers on this major cause of frequent damages to bridges. Due
to inadequate knowledge and uncertainties about many aspects of bridge
hydraulics and river behaviour
in
general,
it
is not possible
to lay down



======================================================================
PAGE 111 of 132
======================================================================
99
^
guidelines which can claim to have a general validity of application. Some of
the most common hydraulic deficiencies which could occur are as under
:
(i)
Actual discharge in excess of that assumed in the design,
(ii)
Substantial increase
in velocity of the river/stream from that
for which it was designed,
(iii)
Increase in scour depth from die
one adopted
in design of
foundations
resulting
in
settlement of one or more
foundations of the bridge,
(iv)
Damage to the piers of the bridge due to the impact of floating
debris brought by the stream during floods,
(v)
Oblique flow of
the stream under the bridges,the angle of
obliquity being more than that assumed in the design.
The causes for occurance of these and other similar deficiencies have
to be explored, examined and
thereafter
suitable
remedial/rehabilitation
measures may be adopted so as to ensure safety and serviceability of the bridge
structure.
An attempt has been made to mention a few examples of the common
rehabilitation measures for damages caused by floods.
8.2.
A bridge structure can substantially get damaged by floods.
There are cases where rehabilitation of bridges become necessary on account
of changes in the
hydraulic parameters
as manifest during flood conditions.
The damages can be caused due to (1) abnormal floods,
(2) normal floods,
if
the design of the bridge does not cater adequately to the normal design flocds
and/or (3) as
in a few cases, due to man-made changes
in catchments of
watercourse,
e.g.
the flood
levels may exceed
the
original design
levels
substantially due to back water effect of a storage constructed downstream
requiring raising of the bridge superstructure.
8.3.
Floods can damage bom the bridge structure as well us u j
approaches and the protective measures.
The bridge engineer
is advised
lo
refer to IRC: 89-1985
"Guidelines
for Design and Construction of River
Training and Control Works for Road Bridges."



======================================================================
PAGE 112 of 132
======================================================================
100
8.4.
If either due to inadequacy of original hydraulic design or due
to the requirements of traffic as in a submersible bridge, the bridge level has
to be raised, the same can be done by raising the superstructure with the help
of jackets and extending the sub-structure in suitable stages by successfully
resting them on the precast concrete pads which can then be embedded in the
raised height of the piers. Where, however, the bridge deck is not to be raised
but the bridge has to be protected from floods higher than the design floods,
then designing the bridge as a submersible one and strengthening the same may
have to be explored. At the same time suitable corrective measures may have
to be adopted for decking and approaches, like provision of air-vents between
the girders, protection of embankment, strengthening of piers by jacketting etc.
8.5.
When the velocity and consequentially calculated scour in
the stream is expected to increase and the substructure is found to be unsafe
under such conditions, a solution of paving the bed with
suitable aprons
upstream and downstream can be considered to prevent the scour around the
piers and
the piers may
also be strengthened by jacketting.
If partial
submergence of the bridge is unavoidable and if the live load on the bridge is
found to cause excessive stresses, then it may be necessary to provide spilling
section in the approaches so that the live load is automatically cut off when the
water level exceeds a specific limit.
8.6.
If damages
to the bridge and approaches are of frequent
nature then after careful investigations it may be necessary to extend the length
of the bridge to provide adequate waterway.
If the floods attack one side of
the bridge, then additional spans could be provided on
the affected
side.
Sometimes such situation can be handled by adequately designed spurs or
groynes.
In some cases, the returns beyond the abutments get damaged and
may require replacement by returns on deeper foundations. Where a pier gets
damaged beyond repairs, the span lengths could be changed either by locating
a
pier
in between
or
if possible, by doubling
the spans with
suitable
strengthening of the remaining substructure.
8.7.
Bed protection can get damaged due to excessive turbulent
floods or disturbance of stone protection. Surfaces of concrete or masonry can
get eroded by high velocity of stream and sometimes cavitation can occur.
8.8.
The bridge hydraulics is a highly specialised subject and so
the treatment of the damages must be designed and carried out after consulting
a specialist.
Even the IRC general guidelines may have to be modified and
supplemented according to subjective and objective judgement of the engineer



======================================================================
PAGE 113 of 132
======================================================================
101
to cater for such river and specific requirements of a bridge. Use of hydraulic
model studies for specific problems is also of considerable help in arriving at
a proper solution.
9. MONITORING
9.1.
Necesssity
After the rehabilitation/strengthening of the structure is completed, it
is essential that the bridge structure is kept under observation and its condition
monitored regularly so that any distresses are located promptly and corrective
measures taken well in time.
It is essential that the form of monitoring
is
specified and inspections are carried out according to a calendar which should
be prescribed.
The various methods of monitoring the bridge structures are
given in the succeeding paragraphs.
9.2.
Methods of Monitoring
During the distressed stage of a bridge and after the distressed bridge
has been rehabilitated or strengthened, it is necessary to carefully monitor its
behaviour for a certain period of time to ascertain
its performance and the
efficacy of the measures adopted. The monitoring would involve carrying out
certain laboratory and
field
tests as well
as condition
surveys and
measurements to detect even small strains, movements, changes in reaction
and deformations.
9.2.1.
Inspections
: The first and the foremost requirement
is to
carry out principal inspections at more frequent intervals than for normal
structures, say immediately after distress is noticed and on completion of the
remedial measures and, during die use of the structure, at the intervals of 6
months or 1 year thereafter for a period of 2-3 years. These need to be repeated
often after carrying out some of the investigative tests particularly, when any
signs of arousing suspicion are discovered. Use of mobile inspection units to
have an access to each and every part of the bridge is a must for the principal
inspections. The techniques of underwater inspection described earlier may
also be adopted.



======================================================================
PAGE 114 of 132
======================================================================
102
9.2.2.
Changes in behaviour
: The usual methods adopted for
monitoring the behaviour of a structure are
:
(a)
Observing
deflections by periodically taking
levels.
Deformations can be also monitored by water levels in tubes
connected to tank filled with water. The movements of bridg.
can be measured
at
the joints using
slide gauges
fc
maximum/minimum movements and reference pins
for
routine check.
(b)
Visual observations (looking for cracks, deflections, overall
integrity,
profile,
functioning of bearings and
hinges,
corrosion stains, etc.)
Particular note must be made of the
cracking pattern, their width and length and whether cracks
can be due
to
plastic
shrinkage,
settlements,
structural
deficiency, reactive aggregates, corrosion
etc.
Signs of
delamination, spalling, hollow or dead sound when tapped
with hammer, honeycombing and expansion of concrete
shouid also be observed. Frequency and levels of inspections
have to be specified depending on individual circumstances.
(c)
The change in the width of the cracks with the passage of time
needs to be observed through tell-tales and Demec gauges to
know whether the cracks are static or live.
(d)
Plumb bobs are used to measure deviation from verticality for
vertical members
; Special
tilt meters or inclinometers also
could be
used;
(N.B Datum
readings
at the time of
construction are essential).
(e)
Opening of joints, particularly, near the hinges, expansion
joints, etc., need to be observed.
(0
Redistribution of support reactions may also be measured in
some cases.
9.2.3.
Corrosion monitoring: The use of permanent electrodes for
accurate measurement of the corrosion potential of steel in concrete
is also
made.
Use of current density or rebar probes and the use of corrosion rate
monitoring probes can be made to meet the particular requirements.
Careful
selection of permanent monitoring equipment
is
required.
The locations
should be minimum and should be at the area of most active corrosion rate.



======================================================================
PAGE 115 of 132
======================================================================
103
Relatively thin steel wires are embedded in the structure near the reinforcement
with permanent
electrical connections
to
the
tale-
tells so
that
electrical
resistance can be measured.
Corrosion of tale- tells would cause an increase
in the electrical resistance.
Certain devices can be permanently embedded in
the concrete for facility of later measurements of the extent and the rate of
corrosion in future years. However, the evaluation of such instruments is yet
to be perfected. A new probe has been recently developed for evaluation and
control of steel corrosion in marine concrete structures to provide information
about the corrosion condition for both the embedded and externally exposed
steel. The probe gives information on the passsivity of the embedded steel,
electrical resistivity and the oxygen available as well as the corrosion rates.
9.2.4.
Strain measurement
:
The measurement of strains
at
critical sections or joints
is another methbd of monitoring the behaviour of
critical bridge elements. Electronic strain gauges are fixed at predetermined
points. Sometimes dial gauge type strain gauges are also provided. However,it
is
the experience
that these gauges do not work
efficiently
in outdoor
atmosphere.
9.2.5.
Use of lasers
: Application of lasers in structural monitoring
is finding increasing use in developed countries. In its simplest form the system
consists of threading a laser beam through series of apertures in the plates fixed
along the length of the beam,say along the soffit of a girder or soffits of series
of adjoining girders, (Fig 9.1).
Simililarly, a laser beam can also be directed
vertically along the bearings or a column. The beam after passing through a
series of apertures in plates thus fixed along this path reaches the light sensitive
receivers at the farthest end. The failure of the beam in reaching the receiver
requires
further investigation because
it could be due
to some
structural
deformations of the members supporting the plates or due to some other
reasons. A system of series of such laser beams can be provided in a structure
and arrangement made to sound an alarm in case of blockage of light of any
laser beam.
Further refinement of the system could be made by attaching detectors
to the structure along the path of the laser beam whereby any movement of the
structure at the location of each detector would be continuously tracked by the
latter
relative to the laser beam and the actual overall behaviours of the
structure at each detector location can be measured, recorded and analysed with
the help of computers controlling timing and the operational sequence of the
various detectors. Readings to the accuracy of even 0.1 mm are possible and

Laser monitoring
of deck girders
continuous and constant 24 hours-a- day monitoring of a structure for
its
integrity and soundness is possible.
9.2.6.
Measurements for vibration characteristics of a structure can
also be adopted in some cases to monitor the continued structural integrity and
strength in the long run. However, a specialist's guidance should always be
obtained
9.3.
Instrumentation
Instrumentation has to be provided for proper monitoring of long span
bridges to study their behaviour during their service life. The measurement
may include concrete strain at critical points, temperature effects, deflections,
movement of hinges, etc.
9.4.
Training
Monitoring of distressed bridges as well as rehabilitated bridges
requires a great deal of skill and specialisation. The engineers maintaining and
inspecting such bridges
therefore will need to be trained for such jobs.
9.5.
Monitoring also requires setting up a data bank as a reference
frame. This should be initiated at the time of construction.
9.6.
Testing, measurements and analysis of data are important to
monitor the condition of the bridges. The sampling frequency of testing,



======================================================================
PAGE 117 of 132
======================================================================
105
therefore, has to be decided with the help of an expert. In the beginning, an
extensive random sampling could be adopted to study the variability of the
results.
Later,
after studying
the
variability of the
results
limited
target
sampling may be decided. Both
in
selecting
the sample
size and
the
interpretation of the results, expert guidance is absolutely essential.
10. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
10.1.
Introduction
Repairs and rehabilitation is as much an art as it is a science which is
not yet fully developed and has quite a few imponderables. Some techniques
and materials are still under development.
These limitations should be well
understood. This chapter, though strictly not a part of the Guidelines, has been
added only for information to indicate some areas requiring research and
development. Needless to say that the list is not complete.
10.2.
Criteria of Practicality
This Chapter should be read in conjunction with the recommendations
for research given in Chapter 6 of IRC: SP: 35. In seeking to devise improved
ways to rehabilitate and strengthen bridges,
it is necessary to meet the criteria
of practicality as below:
Techniques must be
robust and should not be
unduly
sensitive to workmanship
defects;
Techniques must be resistant to environmental condition;
It
is necessary that repairs techniques be improved so that
minimum delays are caused to traffic;
Techniques must be relatively cheap;
Techniques should preferably involve proven technology
and new
ideas should be introduced with due care and
attention.
10.3.
Goals of Research
The goals for future research and development will have to be (a) to
establish durability oriented technology for design and construction of bridges
to be accomplished by developing
standards, codes,
specifications and



======================================================================

======================================================================
106
detailing and (b) to increase the service life of the existing bridges by improving
methods of investigation to quantify the level and rate of deterioration and by
containing the future deterioration.
10.4.
Areas of Research
Different areas which call for intensive research and development
effort to achieve better rehabilitation and strengthening of bridges are
:
Methods of detection and prediction of distress, damage or
degradation of the existing
structures and
the
testing
facilities involving radiography, high frequency radar, air
permeability method etc.

for strengthening bridges by bonded
plates and long term performance of such methods of
strengthening under adverse environment.
Instrumentation
techniques
for monitoring long term
deformation of structural members.

including vapour phase corrosion inhibitors to prevent initial
corrosion.

Standards for grouting of cables
in respect of viscosity,
bleeding, shrinkage, strength, permeability and bond.
Better characterisation of the physical
properties of
deteriorating concrete and repair materials
for use
in
established methods of analysis so as

accurately
the behaviour of damaged
structures and
to
explore the ways of possible restoration of strength.
Testing and diagnostic methods for detection and prediction
of distress damage or degradation in the existing structures.
Improving the methods of evaluating the residual life of a
bridge structure.

in post-tensioning ducts and
methods to deal with the voids when located.
Factors
that affect performance of expansion joints and
bearings like e.g. relative movements between decks and
bearings.
Also design that permit easier maintenance and
replacement.
Quality tests for evaluation of repairs on site.
Development of expert systems for diagnosis and repair
techniques for various combinations of distresses.
11. MISCELLANEOUS ASPECTS
11.1.
There are certain important aspects of rehabilitation and
strengthening of bridges involving measures other than
technical which
deserve due attention at various stages by concerned authorities. These are
:
Safety of the public using the bridge
till the repairs are
satisfactorily completed.



======================================================================
PAGE 120 of 132
======================================================================
108
Effective control of traffic
and
traffic restrictions,both in
terms of speed as well as load, till the repairs are completed.
(Radar meters are used for controlling speed. Weigh bridges
have to be installed on approaches to control the weight of
vehicles using the bridge,
- even portable weigh in motion
systems could be used).
Contingency plan for diversion of traffic and other necessary
actions in case of any mishap.
Providing proper information to public through publicity
and press and countering any ill founded rumours.
Sometimes public-interest litigations also crop up which
have to be handled properly.
Last but not the least, the morale of the engineers in charge
of the work has
to be maintained since they would be
carrying out such repairs at a great risk to their own safety.
11.2
After completion of every such job of rehabilitation of a
bridge, an engineer must prepare a document to enable drawing lessons for the
future so as to improve the bridge technology.
Provisions must be made in
structures at the design stage itself for the possibility of future interventions
like rehabilitation, strengthening, replacement of some components etc. A
number of fruitful lessons can be learnt from the adverse experiences on the
bridges and the consequent improvement of bridge technology.

APPENDIX-1
QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF CORROSION OF STEEL IN CONCRETE
Recently a few electrochemical techniques have been experimented
with good degree of correlation with
the actual corrosions.
In
all the
techniques, one electrical terminal is taken from the reinforcement network at
some convenient point. A probe sensor is then moved on the concrete surface
along
the rebar network
profile.
Corrosion current flowing
at different
locations between the sensor on the concrete surface and the steel rebar just
below the sensor in that location is measured.
Galvanostatic pulse technique
:- A short time anodic current pulse
(typically some seconds) is imposed on to the reinforcement galvanostatically
from a small probe on the concrete surface and the resulting change in potential
is recorded with a recorder
for
further calculations.
Battery powered
galvanostats are used.
Polarisation resistance technique :- Main instruments required are
a potentiostat and a wave analyser.
Using a suitable sensor, the potential of
the steel rebar at any location is shifted by a small amount and the resulting
current
is recorded.
From
the slope of the curve, corrosion
current
is
calculated. Contribution from the concrete resistance is deduced through A.C.,
impedance measurement at higher frequency and deducted to get the true
polarisation resistance.
From polarisation resistance values, the corrosion
current is determined.
A.C. Impedance:- A Frequency Response Analyser is employed. A
small amplitude voltage sine wave
is applied and the current response
is
obtained as modulus of impedance and phase shift for various frequencies.
In all the above techniques, the measured value relates to polarisation
resistance 'Rp' or 'Rt\
Corrosion rate 'X' in um/year is obtained as follows
:
v
K.B.
X = -—-
where
Rp.A
K
B
A
is conversation constant
is stern-Geary constant
is surface area (sq.cm)

Harmonic Analysis :The method
is relatively quick and easy to
perform on site with a portable frequency response analyser which has suitable
harmonic facilities. Direct reading of corrosion rate is possible.
It is to be pointed that polarisation resistance technique is a practical
and simple on-site corrosion-rate-measurement technique provided a suitable
probe and instrumentation are used.
