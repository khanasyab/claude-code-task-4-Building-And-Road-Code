1. INTRODUCTION
Providing good road network is very essential for the development of any country. In India, there are
about more than 6 lakh villages located
in different terrain conditions,
e.g., plains,
hilly and mountainous
region, deserts, swamps, coastal region, backwater area, tribal pockets, etc. The climatic conditions also vary
from place-to-place to a great extent. Social, economical and educational development of these villages greatly
depend on accessibility. A large number of villages
in the rural
India are
still not connected with the
all-weather roads. The employment opportunities and basic necessities,
like, health, education cannot reach
rural masses without a system of good road network. It has now been realised that for the development of rural
areas, development of proper and communication system must be a priority.
The rural roads are the basic infrastructure required for the development of rural areas. Rural roads
have been planned and constructed under various Rural Development Programmes of the Government of India.
Serious efforts through these programmes also could not make all-weather connectivity to more than 50 per
cent of the 6 lakh villages. On the other hand, many roads which have been built could not be sustained. Careful
examination of these has revealed that most efforts have not been effective due to the fact that
in those
Programmes, the roads were not understood to be engineering structures. These non-engineered stuctures,
without back-up systems and facilities to sustain them with engineering inputs for repair and maintenance,
have disappeared in no time. Many of the technical aspects of road making were never given due importance in
rural roads; e.g., edequate compaction of subgrade, drainage, required cross drainage, and host of others. There
must not be any inhibition about the technical details that are required to be understood for rural roads; these
are required to be adopted necessarily. But, none of those are impossible to adopt for local agencies and
authorities by any means. Moreover, there are plenty of appropriate technologies for rural road constuction
and maintenance using locally available materials as well as local agricultural implements.
Continued emphasis was laid in all the nine Five- Year Plans on village connectivity with an aim of
achieving
1 00 per cent road connectivity to all villages by the turn of the century. Over these Plans, substantial
development has taken place
in the expansion of rural road network. However, there has been admittedly
neglect in proper maintenance of rural roads after their construction inb the absense of uniform guidelines. The
geometric standards, construction practices and maintenance policies differ from
State-to-State. The rural
roads continue to suffer from the lack of unifrom standards also because of the fact that a number of agencies
in the States have undertaken rural road construction under various schemes. Therefore, IRC felt
it necessary
to have uniform guidelines on rural roads to achieve planned and effective development of rural roads.
The Government of India had launched a major rural roads programme, known as Pradhan Mantri
Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), for the first time focussing directly on the rural connectivity keeping rural
roads of uniform standard as the only deliverable. It aims to provide the connectivity by good all-weather roads
to all habitations above
1 000 by the year 2003 and for 500 and above by 2007. The all-weather road has been
defined in IRC as a road, which is negotiable during all weathers, except at major river crossings. This implies
that the roadbed is drained effectively by adequate cross drainage structures, such as, culverts, minor bridges
and causeways. Interruption ot traffic as per permitted frequency and duration are, however, allowed. The
1

IRC:SP:20-2002
pavement should be negotiable during all weathers, but this does not necessarily imply that it should be paved
or surfaced or black-topped. An earthen road with gravely soil or an earthen road with a gravel or WBM layer
on top permits all-weather use, depending upon rainfall and soil type. There are many technicalities involved in
the proper implementation of the rural connectivity programme. While planning of the network itself to be
based on master planning for each
district, design and construction have similar technicalities to provide
sustainable roads. For example, the design of the road should be based on soil parameters, rainfall intensity and
the projected traffic on the proposed road. Also, variation in design and specification will often be required in
consideration of the available materials and terrain, and such other reasons. Thus, the Ministry of Rural
Development, Govt, of India constituted three Committees to formulate the guidelines for implementation of
PMGSY in respect of rural road network planning, design and specifications for road as well as culverts and
small bridges.
The Rural Roads Committee was initially constituted in 1997 by IRC. with the terms of reference as:
Network planning, Traffic studies and projections, Modal choice needs, Pavement design, Maintenance and
other connected works. The Rural Roads Committee composition was as under:

The Rural Roads Committee deliberated on various aspects of the rural roads and opined to evolve
guidelines on rural roads, which would provide uniform geometric standards, pavement standards and other
construction practices to achieve planned development of rural roads under various schemes implemented by
the different agencies in the country. The Committee decided to prepare the Rural Roads Manual containing

All these three Committees for PMGSY produced three manuals which were submitted to the Ministry
of Rural Development between April and June 2001
. Thereafter, a meeting was held amongst the IRC President,
Shn A.B. Pawar, IRC Secretary, Shri G. Sharan and
Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development,
Dr. J.S. Sarma, along with key members of PMGSY Committees, viz., Prof. P.K. Sikdar, Director, CRRI and
Shn M.V. Patil, Convenor, Rural Roads Committee & Past President, IRC on the 7
th September, 2001
.
It was
then decided that the manual prepared by IRC and the three manuals prepared by PMGSY Committees be
merged to bring out a complete and comprehensive document to be called "Rural Roads Manual" and same
will be an IRC Special Publication. Accordingly, a Joint-Committee meeting was held on
1 3
and
1 4
October,
2001
at CRRI, New Delhi with members from the IRC Rural Roads Committee and members from the three
Committees ofPMGSY to combine all the information of the two sets of manuals and a combined manual was
prepared. The combined manual was considered by HSS Committee on 17
th November, 2001 and the Executive
Committee in its meeting held on 29th November, 2001
. The manual was further considered and approved by
IRC Council in their 163
rd meeting held at New Delhi on the 30
th November, 2001
. This manual shall supersede
the existing IRC:SP:20-1979 Manual on Route Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Rural
Roads (Other District Roads and Village Roads) and it will be called "Rural Roads Manual".

IRC:SP:20-2002
2. SCOPE
2.1
.
The Manual covers the various aspects of rural roads in twelve chapters. These are namely -
( 1 ) Planning and Alignment, (2) Geometric Design Standards, (3) Climate and Environment, (4) Road Materials,
(5) Pavement Design, (6) Road Drainage, (7) Culverts and Small Bridges, (8) Construction and Specifications,
(9) Use of Waste Materials, (10) Quality Control in Construction, (11) Maintenance and (12) Finance.
2.2.
The guidelines provided in the manual have largely been drawn from the relevant Indian Roads
Congress Codes, IS Codes, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways Specifications for Road & Bridge Works
and other similar publications available on the subject. All such references are listed appropriately through out
and also user is directed to those wherever appropriate. To make the guidelines useful for wider application in
rural roads planning and construction, the standard practices prevailing in various States, which have been
proved to be effective based on experience have also been included in the manual appropriately.
2.3
.
Rural roads are tertiary system of roads in the total network which include ODR and VR only.
In these guidelines, uniform standards are recommended for uniform adoption across the States. This is an
excellent opportunity for the States to adopt an uniform standard of design and specification for rural roads.
However, in this process, constraints on availability of suitable materials, and therefore, on costs will be the
guiding factor to allow the needed variation without compromising in standards and quality ofroads to be built.
Moreover, considering the vast variance in terrain, climatic and topographic conditions in different rural areas
of the country, a uniform system cannot obviously apply to all areas. As such, the guidelines in the manual
have to be applied taking into consideration the experience of performance of the specifications and locally
available materials. Therefore, in the manual, special emphasis has been provided for use of the locally available
materials as well as waste and marginal materials for construction of rural roads. The approach adopted in the
manual has been to provide all-weather road connectivity to villages with durable roads but with minimum
cost. The guidelines contained in the manual will apply to
all phases of rural road development, such as,
surveying, planning, design, construction and maintenance of rural roads. Where the guidelines are silent, the
relevant IRC Codes, MoRT&H Specifications or IS Codes would apply.
2.4.
The culverts and bridges have been proposed to be as wide as the formation as it would be
desirable for safety of operation. However, in some cases 6.0 m wide CD structure or even single-lane CD
structure
is recommended as special cases for the sake of economy.
This relaxation
is suggested mainly
considering huge magnitude of the work to be done at present as well as the likely future traffic on these roads
and the financial constraints.
2.5.
The experience and feedback from the engineers on adoption of these guidelines will enable
up-gradation of the guidelines at certain interval.
It would be desirable to conduct workshop and training
courses to explain various aspects of rural roads to the concerned field engineers in each of the States.

CHAPTER
1
PLANNING AND ALIGNMENT
1.1.
Planning of Rural Road
Considerable length of rural roads has been constructed under a host of rural development programmes,
especially Community Development Programmes for Rural Roads, Food for Work Programme, Minimum
Needs Programme (MNP), etc. An impetus was further given by allocating more funds under schemes, such as,
National Rural Employment Programme (NREP), Rural Landless Employment Generation Programme (RLEGP)
and Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY). Inspite of all these efforts, rural connectivity still remains quite poor, with
several States having below 50 per cent rural connectivity. The network developed by the criteria of qualifying
populations does not take necessarily into account the travel requirements of unconnected habitations, which
results in sub-optimal road network. Thus, the roads in an area should be considered together with the accessibility
requirements of the habitations, and every unconnected habitation should be provided with connectivity through
at least one road link, which meets its socio-economic requirements.
A habitation can be defined as a cluster of population, living in an area, the location of which does not
change over time. A habitation is considered connected only if it has an access through all-weather road.
All-
weather road is an engineering structure built using proper specification and design and with various cross
drainage works as per the requirements except major river crossings. Interruptions to the traffic as per permitted
frequency and duration are, however, allowed. The interruption is allowed six times a year with maximum one
day at a time; or maximum of 72 hours in case another alternative access is available. A road, though usable for
most of the time, but traffic gets disrupted during rainy season due to lack of all cross drainage works, is called
a fair-weather road.
Various departments, under different programmes without a common network development objective
take up the construction of rural roads, and therefore,
it results into a sub-optimal network. Consolidated
programme of developing an optimal network of roads based on a master plan will provide rationality of choice
and can save any wastage of resources. The network plan or master plan needs to be prepared at a level which
is convenient from the point of map preparation and data collection. Thus, the Master Plan data for rural road
network should be collected/prepared at Block level and then integrated for a District level Master Plan.
1.2.
Planning Database
1.2.1.
Database development
:
In order to prepare a scientific Master Plan for rural roads,
it is
necessary to build a comprehensive database for all habitations and the existing network of all types of roads
and tracks, preferably in the computer environment. The first step in preparation of Master Plan would be to
collect all the information available at district, block and habitation level from secondary sources. The next
step is to collect the detailed information on each habitation and road link through field surveys. Various data
items required for developing the rural road plan can be broadly identified under three categories:
( 1 ) Habitation
level data, (2) Road inventory data, and (3) Map data.
1.2.2.
Habitation level data
: A village/settlement/habitation located within a distance of 500 metres
from an all-weather road or a connected settlement/habitation may be considered to be already connected. All
habitations/settlements having population more than 100 and which are located more than 500 metres (half-a-
kilometre) away from each other or from an all-weather road should be separately identified. The habitation
level data will include details on demographic
(population) and infrastructure facility data (socio-economic
functions or facilities available in habitation/settlement), which should be collected for each habitation.
This
7



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
may be obtained from the secondary sources, such as, census records, revenue records,
etc. and collected
at Block level.
The database details about each habitation should be
filled in a tabular form as given in
Appendix-1.1 (FORMAT-I). The INSTRUCTION-I provides the explanation and guidelines for filling the
format, which is given in Appendix-1.2.
1.2.3.
Road inventory data
: A comprehensive inventory of all rural roads including Other District
Roads (ODR) and Village Roads (VR), and any other road constructed/improved under various rural development
programmes, such as, RLEGP, NREP, MNP, JRY, sugarcane roads, mandi road, etc. have to be prepared at
Block level. For each road, the information on road geometric, road pavement condition, terrain, soil type and
habitations connected by the road are to be collected.
All the available alignments of cart tracks, footpaths,
kutcha road, jeepable roads, etc., which have 5 metres or more land width, should be included for preparing
road inventory. The FORMAT-II in Appendix-1.3 gives the tabular form to be filled for the road inventory
details and the INSTRUCTION-II mAppendix-1.4 gives the procedure for filling the FORMAT-II. In addition
to this, the National Highway (NH), State Highway (SH) and Major District Road (MDR), which form the
primary and secondary road network in a region (say Block), will also be required to be inventoried for proposing
connectivity of habitations. The inventory of these roads shall be prepared by filling the FORMAT-III given in
Appendix-L5.
1.2.4.
Map data
: The base map at Block level should be prepared at 1:50,000 scale by taking
Survey of India topo-sheets as the base. Generally, maps used for planning are in much more detailed scale,
however, due to non-availability of such maps, 1:50,000 scale will suffice. If available, the aerial photos and
satellite imageries, etc. can also be used to further improve the accuracy of the map. The data that are collected
as per the three formats at Block level are to be transformed into maps by drawing Block maps and incorporating
all the information, such as, habitations and road locations. The map should show the Village, Block, District
and any other higher order boundaries, it should show all types of roads (National Highways, State Highways,
Major District Roads, Other District Roads, Village Roads and
all other roads and cart tracks built under
various programmes of the State and Centre) as per the inventories. The colour codes and legends for preparation
of the map are given in Appendix-1.6.
1.2.5.
Digital maps
:
Digital maps with proper registration, etc. should be prepared when the master
planning is to be done in a computerised environment. For computerisation of the data (map, road inventory
and habitation data), a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform may be used. However, the data and
analysis at Block level can be very easily managed manually also.
1.3.
Concept of Network Planning
1 .3.1
.
Network philosophy
:
Rural roads are part of the total road network system. A road network
basically consists of links (roads of various categories, such as, National Highways, State Highways, Major
District Roads, and Rural Roads).
Roads, therefore, become links of a network, which facilitate the essential
movements of persons and goods in an area (say Block or District), and no individual road link can serve the
same purpose when developed in isolation. A road network, therefore, needs to be developed in such a way
that the travel needs of the people or u.j community in an area are met to the maximum in a collective way at
the lowest cost of development. In the rural areas, major part of their travel needs
is comprised of travel to
market place, education centre and health centre (almost 95 per cent of total travel needs). Thus, creation of an
optimal road network is to be aimed to serve the habitations for access to such needs through a Master Plan.

======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
While attempting to optimise the road network, each unconnected habitation has to be connected to the existing
all-weather road network or already connected habitations in an efficient way (in terms of cost and its utility).
There are a large number of methods to develop optimal network for rural roads. However, in practice,
very little or no use of those have been possible so far, primarily due to non-availability ofrequired data and the
Master Plan. The concept and methodology described in this section
is based on the objective of integrated
development and accessibility for rural habitations. While the method is simple, it can be operationalised with
minimum data.
1.3.2.
Utility value
:
Traditionally habitations have been provided priority for an all-weather road
connection solely based on its population size. The Second and Third 20-Year Road Development Plans of
Indian Roads Congress also recommended distinct population criteria for village connectivity. However, the
integrated development approach aims to provide the habitations with access to various service facilities, and
it requires a different criterion based on a composite measure or index or utility value. The utility value for the
habitation should consider a set of demographic, socio-economic, infrastructure, and level of development
data. This composite measure of development may be called as Utility Value (UV) of the habitation. Selection
of the variables for computing the utility value may be made from the habitation level data. The chosen set of
variables may be different in different parts of the country based on local development aspirations.
Each
variable can be given a weightage based on
its present level and importance in the integrated development
philosophy. An example of the choices for weights is presented in Table 1.1.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Utility value is required to be calculated for all habitations, large and small, with population size 100 and
above using the data collected in FORMAT-I. The computed utility value may be used for the prioritisation of
habitations. For ease of computation, the facilities (functions) given in Table 1.1 may be grouped appropriately;
and one such possibility is shown here:
(i)
Primary and middle school
(ii)
High school, intermediate and vocational school
(iii) Medical and veterinary facilities
(iv) General infrastructure, such as, post and telecommunication, police station, bus service, electrification, local administration,
etc.
(v)
Commercial establishments including industrial units (e.g., handlooms, handicrafts, sugar mills, etc.)
The grouped facilities will have to be assigned weights for different levels of development.
1.3.3.
Development of links
: The available options of connectivity for habitations shall be guided
by certain assumptions as given below in order to develop a road network, which adequately meets the
accessibility requirements of the unconnected habitations:
(i)
The population of unconnected habitations shall have to travel to nearby habitations to fulfil their locally unsatisfied needs
(utility services).
(ii) The unconnected habitations may be presently connected through fair-weather road links which may have to be upgraded
for all-weather connectivity, or by a new link from the unconnected habitation
to an all-weather link or a connected
habitation.
(iii) The choice of linkage shall be based on network philosophy and at a minimum cost.
The above assumptions are the basis for the development of rural road network in a Block or a District in
a structured manner as described in Fig.
1.1. Guidelines given in IRC:SP:48 'Hill Road Manual' can also be
referred for hill areas.
By arranging all the unconnected habitations in descending order of the Utility Value, and fixing a cut-
off value, prioritised order of habitations may be identified. The population of unconnected habitation will
generally go to a habitation having the required utility services (facilities) within a reasonable influence area
through a shortest route. From the several possibilities based on available fair-weather roads/tracks, etc. or
new alignments of shortest length to nearest all-weather road or an already connected habitation, suitable
options are to be identified for selection of the best link option.
The best link option shall be the one with highest benefit that it offers in terms of potential utility of that
connectivity. The benefit offered by a link is going to be directly proportional to the population sizes of all the
habitations
it serves or indirectly in proportion to the Utility Values (UV) of the habitations. If a road link
serves more than one unconnected habitation, a weighted average of Utility Values may be adopted based on
the portion of length of the proposed link that will be used by each of these habitations. The cost of a link will
depend on the link length and the type of improvement (when
it is an existing fair-weather road or a track)
needed to make it an all-weather link or the cost of the new link. The choice of the link shall be based on the
corresponding access benefit-cost ratios for the options evaluated.
1.4.
Rural Roads Plan
The district rural roads plan is a combined Master Plan of all the Blocks for which the optimal network
links for the unconnected habitations are shown in the descending order of priorities. Block-wise prioritised list
ofroads for next 5 to 10 years shall be prepared, and all the Blocks in a District are to be considered together for
District level Master Plan to be prepared (considering appropriately the development priorities for the roads

with all information at Block level, so that the implementation of road programme is possible at Block level.
Thus, based on the budget available the number of links can be selected from the list of prioritised links for
taking up in a given year or any suitable plan period. The chosen links for development in a given year shall be
further studied for detailed project planning and preparation of estimate.

1.5.
Road Alignment and Surveys
The alignment of rural road should be decided only after conducting proper surveys and investigations.
In general, most new roads will also have to follow the existing cart tracks and other such existing alignments.
However, during route location the following points should be considered:
(i)
Adoption of appropriate geometric design standards and safety requirements
(ii)
Keeping to the high ground so as to avoid low lying areas and minimising the drainage requirements
(iii)
Following the land contours as far as practicable to reduce the extent of cut and
fill
(iv)
Conforming to any property boundaries to the extent possible
(v)
Avoiding or minimising the effect on vegetation
(vi)
As far as possible, alignment should not interfere at any stage with services, like, power transmission lines, water supply
mains, etc.
Following special considerations are to be given due importance for the alignment in mountainous terrain:
(i)
When crossing mountain ranges, the road should preferably cross the ridges at their lowest elevation. In certain cases,
it
may be more expedient to negotiate high mountain ranges through tunnels. This decision should be taken after considering
the relative economics or the strategic requirements.
(ii)
While fixing the alignment the introduction of hair-pin bends should be avoided as far as possible. In unavoidable cases,
the bends should be located on staLie and flat hill slopes in due consideration of geometric design. Also, a series of hair-
pin bends on the same face of the hill should be avoided.
(iii)
As far as possible, attempt should be made to avoid unstable hill features, areas having perennial/potential landslide or
settlement problems, areas subject to seepage/flow from springs, hydel channels,
etc. For details.
Hill Road Manual
(IRC:SP:48) should be referred.
While deciding the alignment of a road, rural road development in reference to the objectives of Road
Development Plan 'Vision 202
1
' of MoRT&H need to be borne in mmd before undertaking further investigation
and subsequent fmalisation of the alignment.
The location or the layout of the centre line of the road on the ground
is called the alignment.
The
horizontal alignment includes the straight path, the horizontal deviations and curves. Changes in gradient and
vertical curves are covered under vertical alignment of road. A new road should be aligned very carefully, as
improper alignment would mean either capital loss initially in construction as well as recurring loss in cost of
maintenance and vehicle operation.
Once the road
is aligned and constructed,
it
is not easy to change the
alignment due to increase in cost of adjoining land and construction of costly structures by the roadside. The
ideal alignment between two points should satisfy requirements as given under
:
(i)
Short:
It is desirable to have a short (or shortest) alignment between two terminal stations. A straight alignment would
be the shortest, though there ma
be several practical considerations, which would require deviations from the shortest
path.
(ii)
Easy: The alignment should be such that
it is easy to construct and maintain the road with minimum subsequent problems.
Also, the alignment should be easy for the operation of vehicles with easy gradients and curves.
(iii)
Safe: The alignment should be safe enough for construction and maintenance from the viewpoint of stability of natural hill
slopes, embankment and cut slopes and foundation of embankment.
Also,
it should be safe for the traffic operation in
terms of safe geometric features.
(iv)
Economical: The road alignment would be considered economical only if the total cost including initial cost, maintenance
cost and operational cost, is the lowest.
(v)
Sound:
The alignment should be on the firm ground and should
not be susceptible to large settlement, deformation,
landslide, etc.
(vi)
Aesthetics: While selecting the alignment, the aesthetics of the area should be borne in mind.
(vii) Environment: The alignment should be decided giving due weightage to environment protection, particularly
in hilly
areas. Tree cutting should be avoided as far as possible by suitably locating the road alignment. Further details regarding
environmental issues are provided
in Chapter 3.

IRC:SP:20-2002
1.6.
Governing Factors for Route Selection
1.6.1.
General considerations
(i )
The alignment should be as direct as possible so that there is maximum economy in cost of construction, maintenance and
transportation.
(ii)
The grades, curvatures and profiles should be so designed as to be economical, consistent with the service requirements.
(iii)
While improving the existing alignment, the endeavour should be to utilise the existing facility as much as possible
in
order to minimise the cost and effort of land acquisition and construction.
(iv)
The alignment should not interfere at any stage with services, like, power transmission lines, water supply mains, etc.
(v)
Embankment and pavement account for major proportion of the road cost; therefore, availability of material for embankment
and pavement construction should be kept in view while finalising the alignment.
Similarly, good subgrade conditions
would mean lower pavement cost and thus the subgrade conditions also affect the choice of alignment.
To the extent
possible, areas susceptible to subsidence (due to mining, etc.), marshy and low lying areas prone to flooding, inundation
and erosion should also be avoided.
(vi)
While connecting population centres, the alignment should preferably skirt round the population pockets rather than pass
through congested areas.
1.7.
Factors Controlling Alignment
The various factors, which control the road alignment, may be listed as:
(a)
Obligatory points
(b)
Traffic
(c) Geometric design
(d) Economics
(e) Drainage
(f) Other considerations
1.7.1.
Obligatory points
: There are control points governing the alignment of the roads. These
control points may be divided broadly into two categories
:
(a)
Points through which the alignment
is to pass
(b)
Points which the alignment should avoid.
Obligatory points through which the road alignment has to pass may cause the alignment to often deviate
from the shortest path.
The various examples of this category may be a bridge
site, intermediate town, a
mountainous pass or a quarry.
When it is necessary to cross hill mountains or high ridges, the various alternatives are to cut a tunnel or
to go round the hills or to deviate until a suitable hill pass is available. The suitability of these alternatives
depends on many other factors, like, the topography and site conditions. Fig.
1 .2 shows how the straight alignment
AB is deviated along the hillside passes thus avoiding a tunnel or heavy cutting.
The road bridge across a river should be located only at a place where the river is straight and has firm
banks and where the bridge abutment and pier can be properly founded. The road approaches to this bridge
should not be on curve near the bridge and as far as possible skew crossing should be avoided as shown in
Fig.
1 .3. Thus, in order to locate a bridge across a river the road alignment may have to be changed. Similar is
the case with the railway crossing.
As far as possible,
at unmanned level crossing the alignment shall be
straight. Besides, it shall be ensured that there are no features on the ground, which would obstruct the visibility.
The site for the level crossing may invariably be decided in consultation with the railway authorities.

IRC:SP:20-2002
(B)
Fig. 1.2. Alignment near Hillside Pass
Fig. 1.3. Location of Bridge
Obligatory points through which the road should not pass also make
it necessary to deviate from the
proposed shortest alignment. The obligatory points, which should be avoided while aligning a road, include
religious places, very costly structures, unsuitable land, etc. Religious places include temples, mosques, churches,
graves, tombs and archaeological places, reserve forests, etc. Acquiring costly structures would mean heavy
compensation resulting in increased cost.
Marshy, peat and waterlogged areas are generally unsuitable for
road construction and should be avoided as far as possible. However, ifthere is no alternative and the alignment
has to be taken across such an area, the construction and maintenance costs are likely to be very high due to
special construction techniques to be adopted.
A lake, a pond or a valley, which falls on the path of a straight alignment, will also necessitate the
alignment to deviate from the straight path and go round along the lake as shown in the Fig.
1 .4.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Fig. 1.4. Alignment near Lake
1.7.2.
Traffic
: In most of the cases, the people use certain routes traditionally. These may either be
due to convenience, social connection with other areas, etc. The proposed alignment should keep in view this
traffic flow pattern. At the same time one should also have a fair judgement of future trends in mind.
1.7.3.
Geometric designs
: Geometric design factors, such as, gradient, radius of curve and sight
distance would also govern the final alignment of the road. As far as possible, steep gradient should be avoided
and limited to the ruling or design gradient. Thus, it may be necessary to change the alignment in view of the
design, speed and maximum allowable super-elevation. It may be necessary to make adjustments m the horizontal
alignment of roads keeping in view the minimum radius of curve.
The absolute minimum sight distance, which should invariably be available in every section of the road,
is the safe stopping distance for the fast moving vehicles. Also, there should be enough distance visible ahead
for safe overtaking operations of vehicles. Hence, the alignment should be finalised in such a way that the
obstructions to visibility do not cause restrictions to the sight distance requirements.
1.7.4.
Economy
: The alignment finalised based on the above factors should also be economical.
Avoiding high banking, deep cutting, major crossing and balancing of the cuts and fills can decrease initial cost
of construction. At the same time, care should be taken to see that it is not likely to involve costly maintenance
and operational expenses.
1.7.5.
Other
considerations
: Various other factors that may govern the alignment are drainage
considerations, hydrological factors, social obligations, etc. The vertical alignment (particularly the gradient
and change of grade) is often guided by drainage considerations. The sub-surface water level, seepage flow
and high flood level are also the factors to be kept in view.
1.8.
Special Consideration for Hill Roads
In hill roads, additional care has to be taken for ecological considerations, such as:
(i)
Stability against geological disturbances
(ii)
Land degradation and soil erosion
(iii)
Destruction and denudation of forest
(iv)
Interruption and disturbance to drainage system
(v)
Aesthetic considerations
(vi)
Siltation of water reservoirs
15



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Special care should be taken to align the road along the side of the hill, which
is stable. A common
problem in hill roads is that of landslides. The cutting and filling of earth to construct roads on hillside causes
steeping up of existing slopes which affects its stability. Hillside drains should be provided for adequate drainage
of water across the road. But since the cross drainage structures are costly, attempt should be made to align the
road in such a way that the number of cross drainage structures are minimal.
Different geometric standards are followed in hill roads with reference to gradient, curves and speed,
and they consequently influence the site distance, radius of curve and other related features. The selected route
should be feasible from the point of attaining the ruling gradient. The alignment should involve least number
of hair-pin bends and wherever unavoidable, these should be located on stable and less steep slopes.
In hilly
areas locations which get sunlight should be preferred over locations in the shade. The areas liable to snow
should be avoided. For selection of road alignment in hilly area, reference may be made to Hill Roads Manual
(IRC:SP:48).
1.9.
Special Consideration in Sand Dune Areas
The road should be so located that
it causes minimum interference to the flow of sand-laden winds.
Therefore, the roadway should merge with the line of the land as much as possible. In areas having longitudinal
sand dunes, a location along the ridge or in the inter-dual space should be preferred. Location along the face of
the dunes should be avoided. Locations where sand is loose and unstable should be avoided.
1.10.
Surveys
Final location of the alignment is based on ground verification, and therefore, the engineering surveys
are to be carried out. The surveys may be completed in four stages as below:
(i)
Reconnaissance
(ii)
Preliminary Survey
(iii)
Determination of Final Centre Line
(iv)
Final Location and Detailed Survey
To facilitate the survey team in the tentative selection of alternative alignments for subsequent detailed
ground reconnaissance,
it will be advisable,
to make use of modern techniques,
like,
aerial survey,
photogrammetry and remote sensing.
1.10.1.
Reconnaissance
: Keeping in view the obligatory points the next step will be to undertake
reconnaissance survey in the following sequence:
(a)
Study of topographical survey sheets, revenue maps, geological and meteorological maps, and aerial photographs where
available
(b)
Preliminary aerial survey reconnaissance (as against Aerial Photographs), where practicable
(c)
Ground reconnaissance
(d)
Final reconnaissance of inaccessible and difficult stretches
1.10.1.1. Study of survey sheets and maps
: The study of topographical maps available in the scale of
1 :50000, i.e., 2 cm to
1 km showing towns, villages, rivers and terrain features with altitudes and contour lines
at interval of 20 m and revenue maps may be useful to locate the obligatory and control points and to mark the
probable alternative feasible routes on the topo sheet for further survey on the ground. Such study should be
done by a senior civil engineer to select and mark the possible routes tentatively on the maps keeping in view
the guiding principles. For marking the possible routes on the maps in case of hill roads, IRC:52
"Recommendations About Alignment Survey and Geometric Design of Hill Roads
1
' can be referred.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
The probable alignment can be located on the map from the following considerations as per the details
available on the map:
(i)
Alignment avoiding valleys, ponds and lakes.
(ii)
When the road has to cross a row of hills, possibility of crossing through
mountainous passes.
Oil)
Approximate location of bridge site for crossing rivers, avoiding bends of the river, etc.
(iv)
Achievable gradient in hilly area, when a road is to be connected between two stations. Alternate routes can be considered
keeping in view the permissible gradients say the ruling gradient and limiting gradient.
Map study thus gives a rough guidance of the routes to be further surveyed m the field.
1.10.1.2.
Aerial reconnaissance
: The aerial reconnaissance will also provide a perspective of the
locality and it will help in the final decision in the selection of alignment. The aerial photographs of the area, if
available, to the scale of
1
in 20,000 or
1 in 50,000 can be used to correlate the detailed information obtained
from topo sheet.
1.10.1.3. Ground reconnaissance
: The second stage of survey for route selection
is the ground
reconnaissance. The field survey party should inspect a fairly broad stretch of land along the proposed alternative
routes found out during the map study. The various feasible alternative routes are further verified physically in
the field by ground reconnaissance to select the final route. It consists of general examination of the ground by
walking or riding along the probable routes and collecting all essential and available data as per guidelines
given in Appendix-4 of IRC:SP:48 "Hill Road Manual".
Only very simple instruments, like, Abney Level, Tangent Clinometers, Barometer, etc. are required for
the reconnaissance and collecting the data. All relevant details not available in the map are collected and noted.
Some of the details to be collected during ground reconnaissance are given below:
(i)
Valleys, ponds, lakes, marshy lands, ridge,
hills, permanent structures, archeological structures and other obstructions
along the route, which may not be available from the map study.
(ii)
Gradient, length of gradient and radius of curves of alternate alignments.
(iii)
Number and type of cross drainage structures, maximum flood level and natural ground water level along the probable
routes.
(iv)
Soil type along the routes from field identification tests and observations of geological features.
(v)
Sources of construction materials, water and location of stone quarries.
(vi)
When the road passes through hilly or mountainous terrain, additional data regarding the geological formation, type of
rocks, dip of strata, seepage flow, etc. may be observed so as to decide the stable and unstable sides of the hill for road
alignment.
From the details collected during the reconnaissance, a few alternate alignments may be chosen for
further studies that are based on the practical considerations observed at the site. Preparation of alternate routes
is shown in Fig.
1 .5. A suggested composition of the team and equipments required to be available for efficient
and effective conduct of the ground survey is given in IRC:SP:48 "Hill Road Manual".
1.10.2.
Preliminary survey
: The mam objectives of the preliminary survey are:
(i)
To survey the various alternative alignments proposed after the reconnaissance and to collect all the necessary details of
topography, drainage and soil.
(ii)
To compare the different proposals in view of the requirements of a good alignment.
(iii) To estimate the quantity of earthwork, materials and other construction aspects and to work out the
tentative costs of
alternate alignments.
(iv)
To finalise the best alignment from all considerations.

The survey consists of establishing a base-line traverse, which
is a series of straight lines along the
selected alignment. The preliminary survey can be carried out using suitable survey equipments, such as,
theodolite, etc. depending on the degree of reliability and accuracy required. However, a plane table survey
would be sufficient in most cases where other equipments may not be available. Levels should be taken along
the traverse and across it. Levels along the centre line should be taken at intervals of 50 m and at all intermediate
breaks in ground. The cross-sections should be taken at intervals of 100-250 m in plain terrain, upto 50 m in
rolling terrain, and upto 30 m in hilly terrain. The benchmarks shall be established at intervals of 250 to 500
metres. Physical features, such as, buildings, trees, monuments, utilities, railway lines, canals, drainage channels
should be located by means of offsets. While the traverse is being run, apart from the general information about
traffic, hydrological data may be collected so as to estimate the type, number and approximate size of cross
drainage structures. The soil survey data should be collected
for working out the details of earthwork, slopes
and suitability of materials. The data regarding subsoil and surface drainage requirements, pavement type and
approximate thickness requirements should be collected during the preliminary survey. At critical locations,
like, sharp curves, hair-pin bends, bridge crossings,
etc. the plans should also show contours
at
1
to 3 m
intervals, particularly for roads in rolling or hilly terrain so as to facilitate the final decision. Aerial photographic
survey, in case of hilly areas
is very much suited for preliminary survey when the distance and area to be
covered are vast or the terrain is not hospitable to physical survey.
1.10.3.
Determination of final centre line
: Making use of the maps from preliminary survey showing
the longitudinal profile, cross-sections and contours, a few alternative alignments for the final centre line of the
road are drawn and studied and the best one satisfying the engineering, aesthetic and economic requirements is
selected. Horizontal curves are designed and the final centre line is marked on the map. The vertical curves are
designed and the profile is then determined.
1.10.4.
Final location and detailed survey
: The alignment finalised after the preliminary surveys is
to be translated on the ground by establishing the centre line.
The line to be established in the field should
follow as closely as practicable the line finalised after the preliminary survey and conforming to the major and
minor control points established and the geometric design standards. However, modifications in the final location
may be made in the field if necessary. A compass survey may be sufficient in normal course. The centre line
may be stacked at 50 m intervals in straight reaches and 25 m intervals on curves. In hilly and mountainous
reaches, the interval may be reduced to 20 m and 10 m respectively.
The points of transit and intersection
should be properly marked and referenced. Temporary benchmarks shall be fixed at intervals of about 300 m.
The levelling work
is of great importance as the vertical alignment (especially in hilly areas), earthwork
calculations and drainage details are to be worked from the levels noted.
Normally, the earthwork computations
are based on centre line levels in case of plain country. The cross-section levels may be taken upto the desired
18



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
width at intervals of 30 m or at closer intervals where there are abrupt changes of slopes.
All river crossings,
valleys should be surveyed in detail upto considerably greater distances on either side.
A detailed soil survey shall be carried out to enable drawing of the soil profile. The depth upto which the
sampling is to be done may be
1 .50 to 3.0 m below the ground line or finished grade of the road whichever is
lower. The data collected during the detailed survey should be elaborate and complete for preparing detailed
plans and estimate of the project.
1.11.
Detailed Project Report
The project data collected during the survey and investigations together with the estimates be worked
out and presented for full appreciation by the appropriate authority. These should be prepared in the following
three parts which when read together will constitute the complete project document
(i)
Report
(ii)
Estimate
(iii) Drawings
1.11.1.
Report
: The project report should give a precise account of the different features and may be
dealt with under the following sub-heads:
(a)
Preliminary details: Name of work, broad scope, plan provision, reference to road plan, history, geography, climate, and
necessity of the project.
(b) Road features: Considerations governing the route selection, merits and demerits of alternative routes investigated and
reason for selecting the proposed route.
(c) Land acquisition plans: Land acquisition plans and schedules are prepared from the survey drawings for land acquisition
details. These plans show all general details, such as, buildings, wells, nature of gardens and other details required for
assessing the values.
Rural roads are often developed along the existing cart track connecting village to the main road. The
existing cart track is generally improved to suit the geometric standard of rural road. This requires some land to
be acquired. Land acquisition and payment of compensation should be arranged expeditiously. For this, suitable
provision needs to be made in the project estimates. Efforts need to be made in consultation with the revenue
authorities. Land so obtained should be properly demarcated and guarded from encroachment. Land plans for
quarries are prepared to show the location of quarries, the material available from them, the distance from the
work site, etc.
The road features should be dealt with in more detail containing various aspects as follows:
(i)
Alignment, topographical and geological features
(ii)
Environmental factors- Beneficial and detrimental impact of the proposed road
on the environment in terms of air
pollution to life system, stream pollution, drainage pattern, landscaping, vegetation, etc.
(iii)
Proposals of right of way, acquisition of structures.
(iv)
Traffic- Present and projected for a period of ten years.
(v)
Road design and specification
- Geometrical design of road, pavement designs, retaining works, specifications.
(vi)
Cross drainage structures
- Investigation, details of design proposals, drawing of CD work at the appropriate scale.
(vii)
Materials, labour and equipment - Availability, suitability, lead distance, mobilisation of resources.
(viii) Rates
- Schedule of rates adopted, consideration of price escalation, physical and financial contingency and quality
control measures.
(ix)
Construction programme - Likely period of execution, likely constraints on the works.
(x)
Miscellaneous
- Diversion of traffic, arrangement of water supply and other site amenities, etc.

IRC:SP:20-2002
The design calculation data etc. for above items should be included as Annexures. The project report
along with the detailed estimate and drawings will provide a complete appraisal of the project.
1.11.2.
Estimates
: The project estimate should give the financial implications of the project. The
estimate should include
all items of execution from
site clearance to finishing activities of the work. The
estimate should include general abstract of cost and detailed estimate. The quantity of each item should be
carefully worked out and expressed with relevant units. The rates should be based on the schedule of rates
applicable for the district. Wherever the rates are worked out, detailed rate analysis should be included in the
estimates. Provision of about 3 per cent contingencies and
1 per cent each for work establishment and quality
control should be made in the general abstract. Provision for land acquisition of required width should also be
made if land is to be acquired for the project.
1.11.3.
Drawings
: The following drawings are usually prepared:
(i)
Key map
(ii)
Index map
(iii)
Preliminary survey plan
(iv)
Detailed plan and longitudinal section
(v)
Detailed cross-section
(vi)
Land acquisition plans
(vii)
Detailed drawings of CD works
(viii)
Drawings of protection works and other structures
(ix)
Quarry chart
Key map should show the proposed and existing roads and important places to be connected. Index map
should show the general topography of the area. The details are symbolically represented. Preliminary survey
plans showing details of various alternate alignments and all information collected should normally be drawn
to scales of 10 cm =
1 km to 25 cm =
1 km. A strip plan is prepared showing the ground plan with alignment and
boundaries, contours at interval of 1 to 2 meters in plain country and 3 to 6 meters in hills, all existing structures
and other natural details and geometric features. Longitudinal sections are drawn to the same horizontal scale
of the detailed plans. The vertical scale is enlarged 10 times to the longitudinal scale. The longitudinal section
should show the details, such as, datum line, existing ground surface, vertical profile of the proposed road and
position of cross drainage. Detailed cross-sections are generally drawn to the scale of
1 cm = 2.0 to 2.50 m.
Cross-sections are drawn every 100 m or where there are abrupt changes in levels. In hill roads, the cross-
sections are drawn at closer intervals. The cross-section drawings should be extended at least upto the proposed
right of way.

CHAPTER
2
GEOMETRIC DESIGN STANDARDS
2.1.
Introduction
These guidelines relating to geometric design standards are intended to be applied to rural roads. For
these guidelines, the rural roads shall include Other District Roads (ODR) and Village Roads (VR). These
roads provide accessibility to the villages in the rural area of the country. Geometric design standards of the
rural roads need not be restricted to the minimum values set out and milder values than the minimum should be
preferred where conditions are favourable and the cost is not excessive. Higher standards right in the initial
stages may be warranted in cases where improvement of road geometric (like, widening of formation width) at
a later date is anticipated due to increased traffic.
The following codes have been published by IRC for providing guidelines on the Geometric Design
Standards of Rural Roads.
(i)
IRC:73
Geometric Design Standards for Rural (Non-Urban) Highways
(li
)
IRC:52
Recommendations About the Alignment Survey and Geometric Design of Hill Roads
(iii)
IRC:SP:23
Vertical Curves for Highways
(iv)
IRC:38
Guidelines for Design of Horizontal Curves for Highways and Design Tables
(v)
IRC:SP:48
Hill Road Manual
Above IRC publications deal with geometric design features for all categories of roads including National
Highways. This Chapter exclusively deals with geometric design standards for rural roads and other relevant
features. These guidelines can be adoi-l?d to new roads as well as improvement of existing rural roads.
2.2.
Classification of Rural Roads
The rural roads in India are commonly referred to:
(i)
Other District Roads (ODR)
(n) Village Roads (VR)
Other district roads are the roads serving rural area of production and providing them with outlet to
market centres, taluka headquarters, block development headquarters or major district roads, and would serve
to connect villages with population 1000 and above or cluster of villages. Village roads are roads connecting
villages or cluster/group of villages with each other and to the nearest road of a higher category. These two
categories of roads are proposed to be called together as 'rural roads' with uniform standards.
2.3.
Terrain Classification
The general slope of the country classifies the terrain across the area. The terrain is an important parameter
governing the geometric standards and the criteria given in Table 2.1 should be followed. While classifying a
terrain short isolated stretches of varying terrain should not be taken into consideration.

2.4.
Design Speed
Design speed
is a basic criterion
for determining
all geometric features of horizontal and vertical
alignments. The design speeds for the rural roads should be taken as given in Table 2.2.

Normally ruling design speed should be the guiding criterion
for the purpose of geometric design.
Minimum design speed may, however, be adopted where site condition and cost does not permit a design based
on "'Ruling Design Speed".
2.5.
Basic Principles of Geometric Design
These guidelines are intended for uniform practices to achieve optimum design standards for rural roads.
As a general rule, geometric features of a road do not allow for stage construction. Improvement of features,
like grade, curvature and widening of cross drainage works at a later date can be very expensive and sometimes
impossible in remote and hilly area.
It
is, therefore, necessary that ultimate geometric requirement of rural
road should be kept in mind right in the beginning.
If stage construction is unavoidable, the permanent works, like, retaining walls, breast wall, and drain,
which may have to be altogether rebuilt, may be constructed using dry masonry. Interceptor drains may be
located well at the beginning and culverts provided to full width to avoid the need for their widening subsequently.
The design standards recommended are absolute minimum. However, the minimum values should be
applied only where serious restrictions are implied from technical or economical considerations.
General
effort should be to exceed the minimum values as far as possible. Road should be designed so as to have
minimum turns and the total number of curves in one kilometer should generally be less than 6.
2.6.
Cross-Sectional Elements
2.6.1.
Road Land Width
: Road land width (also termed the right-of-way)
is the width of land
acquired for road purposes. The desirable land width for rural roads in different terrain is given in Table 2.3.

Note: (i)
Additional land width as per requirement may be acquired
at locations involving deep cuts, high banks and unstable or
landslide prone areas.
(ii)
The lower values of land wid'h may be adopted where the traffic intensity
is less than
1 00 vehicles per day, and where the
traffic is not likely to increase due to situation, like, dead end, low habitation and difficult terrain conditions.

2.6.2.
Building and control lines
: In order to prevent overcrowding and preserve sufficient space
for future road development, it is advisable to lay down restrictions on building activity along the rural roads.
Fig.
2.1 shows road land boundary, building
line, control
line, roadway and carriageway for rural roads.

Notes: (i)
For rural roads, where the traffic intensity is less than
1 00 motor vehicles per day, and where the traffic
is not likely to
increase due to situation like dead end, low habitation and difficult terrain conditions the roadway width may be reduced
to 6.0 m in case of plain and rolling terrain.
(ii)
The roadway width given in the Table 2.5 for mountainous and steep terrain
is inclusive of parapet.
(iii)
The roadway width for Rural Roads is on the basis of a single lane carriageway of 3.75 m.
(iv)
On horizontal curves the roadway width should be increased corresponding to the extra width of carriageway for
curvature.
(v)
On roads subjected to heavy snowfall and landslides, where regular snow or debris clearance is done over long period to
keep the road open to traffic, roadway width may be increased by
1 .5 m.
2.6.4.
Carriageway width
: The standard width of carriageway for both plain and rolling as well as
mountainous and steep terrain shall be as given in Table 2.6. Typical cross-sections of rural roads are given in
Figs. 2.2 and 2.3.

At super-elevated road sections, the shoulder should normally have the slope of same magnitude and
direction as the pavement slope subject to the minimum cross-fall allowable for shoulder. The camber for earth
shoulder should be at least 0.5 per cent more than that for the pavement subject to the minimum of 4 per cent.
However,
1 per cent more slope than the camber for pavement is desirable.
2.9.
Sight Distances
Visibility is an important requirement for the safety of travel on roads. For this, it is necessary that sight
distance of adequate length should be available in different situations to permit drivers enough time and distance
to control their vehicles so that chances of accidents are minimised. Three types of sight distance are relevant
in the design ofroad geometry: Stopping Sight Distance (SSD); Intermediate Sight Distance (ISD) and Overtaking
Sight Distance (OSD).
2.9.1.
Stopping sight distance
: The stopping sight distance is the clear distance ahead needed by a
driver to bring his vehicle to a stop before collision with a stationary object in his path, and is calculated as the
sum ofbraking distance required at the particular speed plus the distance travelled by the vehicle during perception
and brake reaction time.
2.9.2.
Intermediate sight distance
: Intermediate sight distance
is defined as twice the stopping
sight distance.
2.9.3.
Overtaking sight distance
: Overtaking sight distance
is the minimum sight distance that
should be available to a driver on a two-way road to enable him to overtake another vehicle. The provision of
overtaking sight distance is by and large not feasible on hill roads and also not considered for single lane roads.
The design values for these sight distances and criteria for their measurement are given in Tables 2.12
and 2.13 respectively.

In addition to these, on valley curves, the design is governed by night visibility also. Application of sight
distance criteria for geometric design is covered in the following sections.
2.10.
Horizontal Alignment
2.10.1.
General guidelines
(i)
The alignment should be as directional, fluent and matching well with the surrounding topography as possible and also
to avoid abrupt changes.
(ii)
On new roads the curves should be designed to have the largest practical radius generally not less than the ruling value
corresponding to ruling design speed given in Table 2.2.
(iii)
Absolute minimum values based on Minimum Design Speed may be used where economics of construction
and site
condition so dictates. The radii below the absolute minimum should not be provided.
(iv)
Straight section exceeding 3 km length should be avoided. A curvilinear alignment with long curve is better from point
of safety and aesthetic.
(v)
Sharp curves should not be introduced at the end of long tangents, since these can be extremely hazardous.
(vi)
Curve should be sufficiently long and have suitable transition curves at either end to eliminate the shock due to application
of centrifugal force.
For deflection angle less than
1 degree no curve is required to be designed.
(vii)
Reverse curves may be needed in difficult terrain. Sufficient length between two curves shall be provided for introduction
of requisite transition curve.
(viii)
To avoid distortion in appearance, the alignment should co-ordinate with the longitudinal profile.
2.10.2.
Horizontal curve
: In general, horizontal curve should consist of a circular portion flanked by
spiral transition at both ends. Design speed, super elevation and coefficient of side friction affect the design of
circular curves. Length of transition curve is determined on the basis ofrate ofchange of centrifugal acceleration
or the rate of change of super elevation.
2.10.3
. Superelevation
: Superelevation to be provided on curve is calculated from the following
formula:
yi
e =
225R
Where
e
=
Superelevation in metre per metre
V =
Design speed in km/ hr
R
=
Radius of the curve in metres
Superelevation obtained from the above expression should, however, be kept limited to the following
values:
Plain and rolling terrain
7
per cent
Snow bound area
7
per cent
Hilly area but not snow bound
] 0 per cent
36

PAGE 65 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Fig. 2.4 indicates the super-elevation rates and radius of curvature for various design speeds on this
basis. For safety reasons superelevation should be used for all roads regardless of traffic volumes. The only
exception may be for very large radius curve. When the superelevation calculated is less than the minimum
camber required for drainage of surface water no superelevation need be provided. Table 2.14 shows the radii
of horizontal curve for different camber beyond which extra superelevation is not required. The change over
from normal section to superelevated section should be achieved gradually over the full length of the transition
curve. In case where the transition curve cannot be provided for some reason, two-third superelevation may be
attained on the straight and the balance one-third on the circular curve. Keeping in view pavement surface
drainage, superelevation should not be less than the rate of camber appropriate for the type of wearing surface.

The change from normal cross-section to a superelevated section should be made gradually. The normal
cambered section of the road is changed into superelevated section in two stages. First stage is the removal of
adverse camber in outer half of the pavement. In the second stage, superelevation is gradually built-up over the
full width of the carriageway so that the required superelevation is available at the beginning of the circular
curve. There are three different methods for attaining the superelevation:
(
i )
Revolving pavement about the centreline
(ii)
Revolving pavement about the inner edge of the pavement
(iii)
Revolving pavement about the outer edge
For rural roads, the first method, i.e., revolving pavement about the centreline will be suitable in most of
the situations. Since vehicles have to frequently use the shoulders in the case of single lane roads, the shoulder
slope on superelevated sections should be of the same magnitude and direction as the pavement slope. The
required superelevation on shoulders should be attained simultaneously with the pavement in the same manner.
In case transition curves are provided, superelevation is attained over length of transition curve.
2.10.4.
Minimum curve radii
: On new roads, horizontal curve should be designed to have the targeted
practical radius generally more than the values corresponding to the ruling design speed. However, absolute
minimum values based on mmimum design speed might be resorted to if economics of construction or the site
conditions so dictate. While improving existing roads, curves having radii corresponding to absolute minimum
standard may not be flattened unless
it is necessary to realign the road for some other reasons. The minimum
curve radii for horizontal curves corresponding to ruling minimum and absolute minimum design speeds are
given in Table 2.15.

2.10.5.
Transition curve
: Spiral curve should be used for transition. This is necessary for a vehicle to
have smooth entry from a straight section in to a circular curve. The transition curve also improves aesthetic
appearance of the road besides permitting gradual application of the superelevation and extra widening of
carriageway needed at the horizontal curve. Transition curve
is provided at both ends of horizontal curve.
Minimum length of transition curves for various radii are given in Table 2.16. For deriving values of the
individual elements like shift, tangent distance, apex distance,
etc., and working out co-ordinates
to lay the
curves in the field,
it is convenient to use curve tables. For this, reference may be made to IRC:38.
2.10.6. Widening at curves
: At sharp horizontal curve,
it
is necessary to widen the carriageway to
facilitate safe passage of vehicles. The extra width to be provided to horizontal curve are given in Table 2.17.
By increasing the width at an approximately uniform rate along the transition curve required widening should
be achieved; the extra width should be continued over the full length of the circular curve. The widening should
be done on both sides of the carriageway, except that on hill roads it will be preferable if the entire widening is
done only on the inner side of the curve.

Set-back distance at horizontal curves

like, wall, hill cut, wooded area, high slope, etc. The sight distance is measured along the middle of the inner

Set-back distance for overtaking or intermediate sight distance can be comnuted similarly but the clearance
required is usually too large to be economically feasible except on very flat curves. Where there is hill slope on
the inner side of the horizontal curve, the average height of sight line for stopping sight distance can be used as
0.7 m for deciding the extent of clearance. Cut slope should be kept lower than the height of the sight line
demarcating the set-back distance, either by cutting back the slope or benching suitably. In the case of intermediate
or overtaking sight distance, height of sight line above the ground should be taken as
1
. 2 m. Where horizontal
and vertical curve overlap, the design should provide for the required sight distances both in the vertical direction
along the pavement and in the horizontal direction on the inner side of the curve.
2.11.
Vertical Alignment
The designer has to always keep an eye on economy in selecting the alignment and the longitudinal
profile. It is general practice to follow as closely as possible the natural terrain profile. Desirably there should
be no change within the distance of 150 m. Two vertical
curves
in same
direction
with
a
short
tangent
should be avoided. The longitudinal profile should be co-ordinated suitably with the horizontal alignment.

Decks of small cross drainage structures (culverts and minor bridges) should follow the same profile as the
flanking road section without any break in the grade line.
2,11.1.
Gradient
: The rate of rise or
fall with respect to the horizontal along the length of road
expressed as ratio or a percentage is termed as the "gradient". Gradient should be carefully selected keeping m
view the design speed and terrain. Various levels of gradients which are generally adopted for roads are as
given below:
(a)
Ruling gradient:
It is a gradient, which in the normal course must never be exceeded in any part of road.
(b)
Limiting gradient:
It is a gradient steeper than the ruling gradient, which may be used, in restricted lengths where keeping
within the ruling gradient
is not feasible.
(c)
Exceptional gradient:
It
is a gradient steeper than the limiting gradient, which may be used
in short stretches only
in
extraordinary situation.
Gradient upto the 'ruling gradient' may be used as a normal course in design. The 'limiting gradients'
may be used where the topography of a place compels this or where the adoption of gentler gradients would
involve additional cost. In such case also, the length of continuous grades steeper than the ruling gradients
should be as short as possible.
'Exceptional gradients' are meant to be adopted only in very difficult situations and for short length not
exceeding 100 m at a stretch. In mountainous and steep terrain, successive stretches of exceptional gradients
must be separated by a minimum length of 100 m having gentler gradients. Recommended gradient for different
classes of terrain except at hair-pm bends are given in Table 2.19. The rise in elevation over a 2 km length shall
not exceed 100 m in mountainous terrain and 120 m in steep terrain. In hilly terrain, gradient should be such
that
it can be negotiated with the least change of gears by heavier vehicles to save time and operation cost.

In the plain area, as the road is used by slow moving bullock carts and motor vehicles, gradient adopted
should be such that
it will not have adverse effect on bullock cart traffic.
2.11.2. Grade compensation at curves
: At horizontal curves, the gradients should be eased by an
amount known as the 'Grade Compensation' which is intended to offset the requirement of extra tractive effort
at curves. This may be calculated from the following formula:
Grade compensation (per cent) = (30 + R) /R
Subject to a maximum of 75//?, where R
is radius of the curve in meters.
Since grade compensation is not necessary for gradients flatter than 4 per cent, while compensation of
the grady they need not be eased beyond 4 per cent.

Vertical curve
: Vertical curves are introduced for smooth transition at grade changes. Both
summit curves and valley curves should be designed as parabola. The length of the vertical curve is controlled
by sight distance requirements, but curves with greater length are aesthetically better. Curves should be provided
at all grade changes exceeding those given in Table 2.20. For satisfactory appearance, the minimum length
should be as given in the Table 2.20.

Alignment Compatibility
As a general rule, changes in horizontal and vertical alignment should be phased to coincide with each
other,
i.e., the vertical curve should roughly extend from the commencement to the end of the corresponding
horizontal curve. Preferably, the horizontal curve should be somewhat longer than the vertical curve. Sharp horizontal
curve should not be introduced at or near the top of the summit vertical curve or the lowest point of valley curve.

A hair-pin bend may be designed as a circular curve with transition at each end. Alternatively, compound
circular curves may be provided. The following design criteria should be followed normally for the design of
hair pin bends
:
Minimum design speed
20 km/hr
Minimum roadway width at apex
7.5 m
Minimum radius for the inner curve
14.0 m
Minimum length of transition curve
15.0 m
The inner and outer edge of the roadway should be concentric with respect to centre line of the pavement.
Where a number of hair-pin bends have to be introduced, a minimum intervening length of 60 m should be
provided between the successive bends to enable the driver to negotiate the alignment smoothly. Widening of
hair-pin bends at a later date is a difficult and costly process. Moreover, gradients tend to become sharper, as
widening can be achieved generally only by cutting the hillside. These points should be kept in view at the
planning stage, especially where a series of hair-pin bends is involved. At hair-pm bends, preferably the full
roadway width should be provided with surfacing.
2.14.
Passing Places
On hill roads passing places are required to facilitate crossing of vehicles. These should be provided at
the rate of 2 to 3 per kilometre. The exact location should be judiciously decided on the basis of site conditions.
The length of passing place should be about 20 to 30 m long with a carriageway width of 5.5 m.
2.15.
Later and Vertical Clearance
2.15.1.
Lateral clearance
:
It is desirable that the full roadway width at the approaches should be
carried through the underpass. This implies that the minimum lateral clearance (i.e., the distance between the
extreme edge of the carriageway and the face of the nearest support whether a solid abutment, pier or column)
should be equal to the normal shoulder width.
2.15.2.
Vertical clearance
: The minimum vertical clearance of 4.5 m should be ensured over the full
width ofthe roadway at all underpasses, and similarly at overhanging cliffs. The vertical clearance should be measured
in reference to the highest point of the carriageway, i.e., the crown or the superelevated edge of the carriageway as
the case may be. Due allowance for any future raising/strengthening of the pavement should also be made.
2.16.
Traffic Engineering Requirements
The rural roads are low volume (traffic) low speed roads with maximum design speed of 50 kmph. The
geometric designs are detailed in this Chapter adequately fulfils the requirements of traffic that is likely to use
rural roads. However, a few features need careful considerations to maintain safety and convenience of the
vehicles using these roads.

2.16.1.
Intersection with other road
: Arural road quite often meets or crosses anotherroad ofhigher
category. In such situation the junction layout is required to be provided m such a way that the safety of the
vehicles leaving the higher category of road and joining the rural road or those which join the higher category
of road from the rural road is maintained adequately. As the higher category of the road will normally have
wider right-of-way provision, the intersection is to be flared along the higher category of road as shown in the
Fig. 2.5. The figure also shows that the rural road should not meet the other road at an angle other than 90°.
Thus, wherever such condition prevails, effort should be made to realign the road near the junction and make it
a right angled junction.
Fig. 2.5. Intersection of Rural and Major Road
2.16.2.
Other traffic engineering features
: The rural roads are designed and constructed as single
lane road with sealed or unsealed surface depending on traffic' and other criteria. Thus, there is no requirement
of pavement marking. Regarding the signs, the following requirements should be met.
Stop Sign: When rural roads meet each other, the junction should be a stop sign controlled junction, and minor road of the two
should be provided with stop signs. In case of rural road meeting any higher category of roads, the traffic joining the higher type
road shall be controlled by a stop sign.
Direction Sign: The rural road shall have all the necessary direction signs as per the requirement of road signages recommended
by IRC.
Kilometre Stone: The rural road shall have kilometre stone of standard size as given by IRC with top rounded portion painted
in orange colour.

CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT
3.1.
Introduction
There
is great variation in climatic conditions throughout the country. Therefore, proper selection of
various road materials such as soil, aggregate, cement and bitumen is required for different types of pavement.
Thus, role of climate
is significant in determining various types of materials to be used in construction. The
different elements of climate are temperature, precipitation and air humidity. Therefore, materials to be selected
for rural road construction need careful consideration in relation to climatic conditions.
3.2.
Rainfall and Temperature Variation
The major elements which affect or modify specifications of materials are rainfall and temperature
variation. The temperature and rain fall data as recorded by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Kolkata
(1996) are shown in Fig.
3.1. The data depicted
in the figure has been grouped in the following ranges of
temperature and rainfall as shown in Table 3.1.

Climatic Aspects
The material, mix proportion and techniques of construction should be such so as to maintain the integrity
of the road structure. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially dangerous substances
which are entering directly or through ram water/ground water and changing the properties of bitumen, cement,
aggregate etc. can harm the pavement and also deteriorate the pavement in its service life. In view of this, due
consideration of climate in selection of materials as well as specific design assumes its importance.
The climatic conditions with their variability in different States are given below:
(i)
Andaman & Nicobar: Andaman & Nicobar has hot and moist weather with heavy rainfall (Greater than
1 000 mm/year).
(li)
Andhra Pradesh: Andhra Pradesh has hot and fairly moist weather with moderate rainfall (500-1000 mm/year).
(in)
Bihar and Jharkhand: Climate
is extreme, hot and dry in summer and cold and
dry
in winter. Bihar and Jharkhand
receive fair to moderate rainfall.

Environmental Issues
Construction of road is often coupled with environmental degradation. It is not only important but also
essential at planning stage itself to consider environmental impact of the proposed road works.
In the case o
major works on existing roads, the impact of these works on the surroundings should be studied and attempt
should be made to enhance the environmental quality. The purpose of this section
is to assist the projec
authorities in respect of planning and carrying out the environmental assessment
and management for rural
road projects, for road projects costing Rs.50 crores or more proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) is
essential as per Ministry of Environment and Forest Guidelines. The guidelines shall be applicable to new
projects as well as projects involving significant changes in the existing facilities.
3 4 1
Environmental assessment
: The procedure is for bringing out the potential effect of human
activities on environmental systems It identifies the possible positive and negative impacts to the environment
resulting from a proposed road project. For identification of impacts, it is useful to draw up a list of parameters
relevant to the project under consideration. The probable impact of the selected alternative on the environment
should be identified and measures may be proposed for mitigating the adverse impacts^ The physical and
environmental features of the alternatives for a proposed project should be brought out. The information may

Environment management plan
: A plan for mitigation, protection and/or enhancement
measures based on identified environmental impacts to be developed.
It is intended that the implementation
status of protection measures, will be evaluated for incorporation in design phase of the
project itself.
The
management of environment may cover all possible adverse affects.
Hydrology
: Road projects that cross waterways can have significant impact on both surface water and ground water hydrology.
For example, without provision of adequate drainage, a road can act as a dyke and possibly lead to increased flood water level.
Surface Water Quality
: Water quality can be affected during construction and operation of roadway.
Pollution can also occur
during roadway operation through accidents or spill of transported materials.
Air Quality
: There are two main sources of emission during construction
i.e. mobile and fixed sources.
For rural road project,
the air pollution impact may not be appreciable except that the suspended dust particulate may be more at the time of passing of
vehicular traffic. The aspect
is required to be evaluated and measures to control dust pollution may be implemented.
Aesthetic Considerations
: The align should be selected to have a pleasing blend with the natural terrain.
In the rural areas
where speeds are low,
it is more a question of having an aesthetically pleasing alignment fitted gracefully into the surroundings.
Proper landscaping with plantation shall be taken up to maintain the environment.
Soils
: The area from where soil
is excavated for construction of embankment, becomes pond with stagnated water for long
periods.
Inadequate protection of cut and
fill areas and poor drainage from roads may lead to serious erosion problem, thereby,
damaging the road and degradation of water. The following steps are, therefore, required:
(i)
Describe the type and origin of soil material to be used
in cut and
fill operations and estimate the amount of soil
involved.
(ii) Discuss the amount of erosion expected, impacts of erosion on resource values and erosion control methods during
and after construction.
Noise: The noise assessments may not be required for a rural road project as the number of anticipated vehicles is generally low
and the area is generally wide open.

Socio-economic: Road projects can provide beneficial impacts through increased access, which in turn can lead to proliferation
of related developmental activities and employment generation. The quality of life value, public health and other related aspects
may be evaluated.
The degree of impact of road construction on the different environmental aspects vary depending on
factors such as the types of area, the terrain (plain, rolling or hilly), and the land use pattern of the area.
For
example, road construction in the hills is associated with problems like landslides, soil erosion, etc. which are
of serious environmental consequences. Where a road has to pass through forest land, obtaining necessary
clearance from the Department of Forests and Wildlife
is important.
Thus, depending on the situation, the
aspects requiring detailed study should be identified and the investigations organized accordingly.
3.4.3.
Road construction in hilly areas
: Construction of a road in the hills is a human necessity for
providing the basic communication facility, but this activity invariably disturbs the natural setting and creates
conditions conducive to large-scale landslides in the first few years of construction. Even dense forests are not
immune to this problem.
With the removal of vegetative cover, destructive action of water gets further
pronounced and accelerates the process of soil erosion and formation of deep gullies. Consequently the hill
faces are bared of soil and vegetative cover and enormous quantities of soil and rock move down the rivers, and
in some cases the road itself is washed out.
While the adverse effects of hill road construction on the environmental/ecological system cannot be
eliminated altogether, counter measures must be taken by the road construction agencies to bring down the
adverse effects to the barest minimum possible. This calls for careful attention right from the stage ofconception
of the road to surveys and investigations, alignment selection and project formulation, construction, and
subsequent maintenance. To ensure that best results are achieved and expensive maintenance is avoided, measures
taken should not be considered in isolation but built into the road project itself as an integral part with
all
necessary provisions for the purpose.
3.5.
Erosion Control
There are numerous instances where many embankment slopes made up of different types of soils suffered
a high degree of damage due to erosion from rain and wind. Denudation of vegetation from soil slopes or the
lack of vegetation cover on embankment slopes is often responsible for the formation of rills and ram-cuts,
eventually leading to a surficial slide or even to undermining of the edges of the road pavement structure.
When vegetation is established on slopes, there becomes available an effective dense network of root system,
penetrating to a depth of about 0.5 to 0.75 m into the slope, which serves to anchor down the soil mantle and
render resistance to erosion. There are a number of techniques to prevent erosion of slopes and are discussed
below.
3.5.1.
Simple vegetative turfing
: This
is most economical method of providing vegetation on
embankment slopes which generally support the growth of vegetation. The method consist ofpreparing a slope
area into seed beds by grading it to the extent possible and then broadcasting seeds or planting root slips of the
promising types of locally available plants. One recommended variation of this technique is that instead of
treating the whole of the slope in poor soils, plantation could be encouraged by putting in seedling in isolated
pockets of specially enriched soil.
There are limits to the successful application of this method. The method is apt to fail in the following
situations:
(i)
On very erodible slopes where seeding or sprigging
is liable to be washed before they have had time to take root.
(ii)
When work is done immediately preceeding or during very heavy downpour.
53



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(iii)
In places where no artificial supply of water
is available for promoting growth of vegetation or where adequate supply of
moisture to the slopes by light rain or drizzle
is not available outside of the monsoon season.
Only under these circumstances,
it
is advisable
to go m
for a special technique, such
as, the ones
recommended in the succeeding paras of this Chapter.
3.5.2.
Transplantation of ready made turfs of grass
:
It
is also possible to provide vegetative
turfing by 'sodding' which involves the bodily transplantation of blocks of turfs of grass (with some 5-8 cm of
soil covering the grass roots) from the original site to the side slopes of the embankment to be treated. If found
necessary, pegs or nails could be used to hold down the grass sods in the initial stage.
3.5.3.
Straw with cowdung or wood shavings or sawdust as mulch
: In case of embankments
which are less than 3 m high, where the severity of the erosion problem is not of a high order, the use of straw
mixed with cowdung, or wood shavings or sawdust mixed with cowdung is recommended as a mulch. The
approximate thickness of wood shavings or sawdust cover should be 25 mm. The organic mulch covering the
soil slopes can be held in place and made resistant to being washed downhill or blown away by pegging them
down with bamboos, at suitable intervals, on a grid pattern and also laying bamboos horizontally connecting
the pegs and thus forming the grids.
3.6.
Special Techniques
3.6.1.
Asphalt mulch technique
: The slope proposed to be treated should be demarcated and
fenced by local prickly bushes or by barbed wire. The slopes should be then prepared into vast seedbeds by
rounding off the tops, regarding or reshaping the slope and by finally raking the topsoil to about 5 cm thickness.
If the slopes are entirely raw and infertile, and if the soil happens to be slightly acidic, calcium ammonium
nitrate should be applied at the rate of 50 kg per 500 sq. metres. The root slips of the most promising types of
locally available grasses should then be dibbled, 15 to 25 cm apart, root to root and row to row. The asphaltic
film gradually disintegrates,
its place being gradually taken up by a carpet of green vegetation, penetrating
through the asphaltic film. The carpet of grass that supplants the asphaltic film acts as an immediate cover for
the slope till the more deep-rooted species of shrubs and trees develop and take root.
After planting of grass
roots, etc., these should be watered. An asphalt emulsion (Mulch) is then sprayed by a suitable sprayer. The
optimum rate of application of the emulsion shall be 0.7- 1 .0 kg. per sq.m. By and large, on the basis ofrequirement
of this technique,
it would be preferable to use a medium to slow breaking emulsion.
If required water may be
added to the bituminous emulsion to give a 50:50 composition of binder and water. The thickness of the
emulsion coating should be optimum because thicker applications would tend to retard the growth of plants and
seeds, whereas application thinner than optimum would not be effective in controlling erosion. The advantages
resulting from the application of the asphalt emulsion are:~(i) susceptibility to erosion is cut down,
(n) the
moisture content as well as the nutrients in the soil mantle are conserved and (iii) the soil temperature is raised
by absorbing the light rays, promoting the emergence of tiny saplings.
The method proves particularly successful
if
it
is so timed that advantage
is taken of the increased
moisture content in the soil resulting from the first couple of monsoon showers. However, neither a continuous
heavy downpour nor a long spell of dry weather occurring immediately after the completed treatment is desirable
since in such an eventuality the process will perhaps have to be repeated partially or fully.
3.6.2.
Vegetative turfing using jute/coir netting
: It has been found that if a heavy mesh ofjute/coir
fabric is firmly laid on loose earth and sown upon with suitable grass seeds, it gives maximum protection to the
soil until the grass takes root and furnishes a permanent coverage.
After the soil is thus stabilised, the netting
54



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
decomposes and provides nourishment to the grass growing on a soil medium, which hardly possesses any
nutrient. The netting can have 2.5 to 5 cm square openings between the threads, giving the grass plenty ofroom
to grow and at the same time providing a large number of check dams per unit area of the material. The netting
is just rolled out on the areas to be treated and is properly secured over the ground where a concentrated flow of
water is liable to occur, and where there is danger of under cutting of the soil. The netting is firmly secured on
to the sloping surface by means of special staples at specified intervals. Control of erosion is effected immediately
after the netting is laid. One half of the normal amount of seeding is broadcast prior to the placement of the
netting and the other half is broadcast after the netting is in place.
3.6.3.
Slope in cohesionless sands :Tn a purely granular material,
it is rather difficult to establish
vegetation. Even if it were possible, the sand drains in between the network ofroot-system are most susceptible
of being piped out or washed out, since the distant roots can hardly afford resistance to the movement of
individual grains at the surface.
Once the movement starts,
it can become progressively unconfined and is
most liable to 'flow
1
. The remedial treatment is thereby to provide 0.25 m to 0.3 m thick layer of clayey soil
(but not heavy clays) as a blanket covering to the slope of the embankment, tamp
it well on the slope and
subsequently provide the simple vegetative treatment. If the circumstances are unfavourable for the ordinary
method, one may resort to the use of special techniques such as those described above.
3.6.4.
Slopes in black cotton soils
: Invariably there does not appear to be any need for any special
treatment against erosion on black cotton soil slopes since most black cotton soil slopes are seen to promote
natural growth of grass and other types of vegetation. The mam problem seems to be the formation of shrinkage
cracks.
Therefore, it is recommended that these slopes may be managed with the simple method of providing
vegetative turfing if the natural growth of grass happens to be inadequate. In case the soil does not support
vegetation directly, a blanket soil, 0.3 metres thick of clayey soil
(but not heavy clays) should be provided to
support the vegetative turfing.

CHAPTER 4
ROAD MATERIALS
4.1.
Introduction
The most important pavement materials are soils, mineral aggregates, bituminous binders, and stabilisers
like lime, cement, water etc. Mineral aggregates constitute bulk of total volume of road construction materials
used. All roads have to be founded on soil and are required to make optimum use of the locally available
materials, if it is to be constructed economically. Materials used in the structural layers of the pavement should
be selected based on availability, economy and previous experience. This aspect must be considered at the
design stage so that the materials can be selected which are the most economical and best suited to the prevailing
conditions.
This chapter covers soil and material survey for proper identification of materials, details about soil and
granular materials including marginal materials which can be used for road construction purposes, their
availability in different parts of the country and their important physical characteristics to assess suitability as
road construction material in different pavement layers. In addition, information has also been provided about
bitumen and cement, their characteristics and suitability for use in bituminous and cement bound bases and
surfacing layer.
4.2.
Soil and Material Surveys
After selection of the final centre line of the road, investigations for soil and other materials required for
construction are carried out in respect of the likely sources and the availability and suitability of materials.
Some other investigations, for example, in respect of landslide prone locations may also be conducted at this
stage. In particular, soil and material surveys are required for various reasons as follows.
(i)
To determine the nature and physical characteristics of soil and soil profile for design of embankment and pavement
(ii)
To determine the proper method(s) of handling soils
(iii)
To classify the earthwork involved into various categories such as rock excavation, earthwork in hard soil, etc.
(iv)
To gather information regarding subsoil water level and flooding
(v)
To locate sources for pavement construction materials and
to ascertain their availability and
suitability for use
in the
different pavement courses.
The
soil and material location surveys should
start from study of all available information such as
-geological maps, data published by the various authorities regarding location of construction materials and the
information available with ground water authorities regarding depth of water table.
Soil maps prepared by the
local agricultural department and records of existing highways may also provide useful information. A study
of these data, if available, will be of great help m planning and conducting surveys and investigations. This
information should be studied in conjunction with general information gathered during the preliminary survey.
IRC:SP: 19 for survey, investigation and preparation of highway project may be referred for further details.
After studying the available information, detailed programme of survey can be drawn up. A comprehensive
district-wise report on survey of locally available materials had been prepared by various State PWDs under
Research Scheme R- 1 "Survey and Evaluation of Locally Available Materials" sponsored by Ministry of Road
Transport and Highways, Govt of India. These reports should be referred, while selecting pavement materials.
The field work consists essentially in identifying different types of subgrade soils encountered along the
alignment and the various other locally available materials, like, moorum, gravel, soft aggregate, etc., that can
be usefully incorporated in road construction. In regard to subgrade soils, representative samples should be
56



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
collected wherever there
is a visible change in soil type. In case the same soil type continues, at least two
representative samples from each kilometre length of road alignment should be collected. Since sampling is
considered as important as testing,
it
is not only desirable but absolutely necessary to make sure that the
samples collected are truly representative of the materials to be evaluated. A certain amount of training and
engineering judgement is necessary to be able to carry out the sampling process effectively. The needed quantities
of soil samples to be collected will depend upon the types of tests to be conducted and will vary from -about
2 kg to 20 kg. For visual classification, gradation and simple plasticity tests, a small quantity (2-5 kg) will
generally be enough while for detailed strength tests like the CBR, etc., as much as 20 kg will be required.
For manufactured items like lime, cement, bitumen, information about their sources of supply and the
distance of the nearest rail/road station from the location of works should be gathered during the survey. The
information should also be collected about the availability of water suitable for road construction works. Where
the use ofbrick aggregates is envisaged, a survey should be made to identify the location and average lead from
the work site of existing kilns capable of supplying overburnt bricks/ brickbats.
4.2.1.
Soil investigations for low embankment
: The first operation in the detailed soil survey is to
demarcate the possible borrow areas along or off the road alignments. The extent of borrow areas should
commensurate with the volume of work involved in the embankment. Test pits 0.5 to
1 .0 metre square should
be dug in the borrow areas from where the embankment material is to be obtained. For borrow-pits along the
road land, the test pits should be at intervals of
200 m but the intervals may be varied depending on the
uniformity or variability of the soil. When embankment material
is to be obtained from off-road locations,
adequate number of samples should be taken from each such area. The depth of test pits should not exceed the
likely depth of the borrow-pits by more than 15 cm where the type of material varies in a single pit, the tests
should be conducted on each type of soil separately and the location of soil types should be noted.
The general character of material excavated from the test pits should be recorded and tests conducted on
it in the laboratory for properties as mentioned below:
(i)
Gradation test based on wet sieve analysis test [IS:2720 (Part 4)-] 985]
(ii)
Liquid limit and Plastic limit [IS:2720 (Part 5)-
1 985]
(iii)
Standard Proctor density and optimum moisture content [IS:2720 (Part 7)- 1980
(iv)
Deleterious constituents (only in salt infested areas, where presence of salt
is suspected) [IS:2720 (Part 27)-
1 977]
In case of highly plastic, poorly draining and unstable soils, some additional soil tests (e.g. consolidation
test, shear strength test) may also be performed. The results of the laboratory investigations should be summarised
in a convenient form, for which a format
is suggested in Format 4.1.
Usually the information should be
enclosed in full with the project report. Based on results of the tests, sand content and classification of the soil
should also be determined. The final selection of the borrow areas whether for the body of the embankment or
the subgrade can then be made in accordance with the norms recommended in Section 4.4. Great caution
should be exercised to ensure and mark, as
far as possible, homogeneous
soils only for this purpose.
Heterogeneous or variable soils should be avoided.
In making the selection
it should be ensured that the best
available homogeneous soil is reserved for use in the subgrade (i.e. top 300 mm portion of the embankment).
After completing the analysis of the results, borrow area details should be prepared as shown in Format 4.2.

4.2.2.
Special investigations for high embankment
: The basic objective of investigations in such
cases is to obtain engineering data for soil and rock that are necessary for a quantitative design of embankment
at the chosen sites.
The details of investigations depend upon the requirements of design.
Generally for
checking stability against slip failures, the basic properties to be investigated are shear parameters, unit weight
and moisture conditions. For safety against excessive settlement, consolidation properties are important. For
investigation of such cases, services of specialists will often be needed. Reference may also be made to IRC:75
"Guidelines for the Design of High Embankments", m case height of embankment exceeds 3 m. IRC:SP:58 on
"Guidelines for Use of Fly Ash in Road Embankments" may be referred,
if fly ash
is used
in making
embankments.
4.2.3.
Soil investigations for cut sections
: In the same manner as described for embankment material,
for soil in cut sections along the centre line of the proposed road at an elevation corresponding to the design
subgrade level should be tested for the following general properties:
(i)
Gradation test based on wet sieve analysis test [IS:2720 (Part 4)- 1985]
(ii)
Atterberg limits [IS:2720 (Part 5)- 1985]
(iii)
Standard Proctor density and optimum moisture content [IS: 2720 (Part 7)-
1 980]
(iv)
Field density and moisture content [IS:2720 (Part 28)- 1974]
In the case of rock cuts where necessary, trial pits or boreholes should be carried out at the foundation
level to make realistic estimates of the type of cutting involved. The interval of trial bores may be 30-50 metres'
or as otherwise decided by the Engmeer-in-Charge depending on specific requirements. Information collected
during preliminary survey would normally identify the landslide prone areas along the alignment and every
effort should be made to avoid such areas while fixing the alignment of the road. However, in cases where it is
not feasible, further investigations would be required to study the extent of the problem and plan appropriate
remedial measures.
For this purpose, services of a geologist or soil specialist may often be needed.
4.2.4.
Soil investigations for subgrade
: For new roads, the soil data already collected in earlier
phases of the survey should be studied in detail for ascertaining the variability/homogeneity of the soil profile,
and plan further investigations. Where pavement design relates to strengthening of an existing road, the road
should be divided into more or less similar sections on the basis of actual testing.
For pavement design, apart from the general soil tests referred to earlier, CBR test should be conducted
for soaked condition unless the annual rainfall
is less than 500 mm and subgrade
is of well drained material.
Frequency of CBR tests should normally be such that roughly one set of results (each consisting of three
samples are available for every one half to one-kilometre section of the road). The interval could, however, be
increased or decreased depending on the discretion of the Engineer-in-Charge.
Overall objective should be to
get strength results for all radical changes in soil type or each demarcated section of similar performance. A suggested
format for presenting soil investigation data pertinent to flexible pavement design is given in Format 4.3.
4.2.5.
Survey for marginal materials and aggregates
: The locally available materials that' can be
used in embankment, subgrade and pavement construction should be thoroughly and judiciously explored. In
this class of materials various types of soils are encountered; sands from streams/river beds and other sources;
moorums which may even be available at shallow depths below the ground level or from other quarries; gravels,
soft aggregate, like, laterite, kankar, dhandla, river sand-gravel mixes, etc. While locations of PWD/Zilla Panshad
approved quarries for locally available materials, like the ones listed above, may not be available but local
enquiries from villagers can help a great deal in this regard. Special care has to be exercised in collection of
samples of these locally available materials since these are generally quite variable in their engineering properties.

Experiences show that the locally available moorums and gravels from the same source can give widely different
strength values. This, naturally has significant implication in the design, construction and performance of
roads. The site quality control of materials can be exercised meaningfully only if sampling and testing of these
locally available materials has been carefully done and design values arrived at judiciously based on the laboratory
strength values. Besides the variable quality of materials, another important factor is that of the quantities
available from each source which should be carefully estimated and invariably noted down during field surveys.
The tests to be conducted and format for presenting the test results are shown in Formats 4.4 and 4.5
Format 4.4 is for aggregates while Format 4.5 is for naturally occurring materials like moorum, gravel and soil
gravel/moorum mixtures.
For every quarry source, at least three specimens should be tested for each type of
material met with. Sample for the tests should be representative and collected in accordance with the procedure
set forth in IS:2430-1986. Quarry charts showing the location of quarries and the average lead of materials
should also be prepared.
4.3.
Soil and Marginal Materials
4.3.1.
General
: Subgrade soil is an integral part of the road pavement structure as it provides support
to the pavement as its foundation. The mam function of the subgrade is to give adequate support to the pavement
and for this the subgrade should possess sufficient stability under adverse climatic and loading conditions. The
formation of waves, corrugations, rutting and shoving in black top pavements are generally attributed to poor
subgrade conditions. When soil is used in embankment construction, in addition to stability, incompressibility
is also important as differential settlement may cause failure. Soil is used in its natural form (gravel and sand)
or in a processed form (stabilised layer) for pavement construction. Soil is also used as a binder in water-bound
macadam layers. Soil is, therefore, considered as one of the most basic highway materials. The foundation of
other cross-drainage structures (culverts, bridges and retaining walls) rests on soils and their stability depends
on the soil 'strength. Knowledge of soil properties is necessary to select the embankment material, pavement
structure, drainage system and foundation of structures. When a high embankment rests on soft ground, its
stability can be predicted by studying the properties of soil. Frost action, common in high altitudes, can be
taken care of if the soil properties are well known.
Soil consists mainly of mineral matter formed by the
disintegration of rocks, by the action of water, frost, temperature, pressure or by plant or animal life. Based on
the individual gram size of soil particles, soils have been classified as gravel, sand, silt and clay. The BIS gives
the following limits of particle size:
Gravel
80-4.75 mm
Sand
Coarse
Medium
Fine
4.75 -2.00 mm
2.00 - 0.475 mm
0.475 - 0.075 mm
Silt
0.075
- 0.002 mm
Clay
Less than 0.002 mm
4.3.2.
Types of soils
:
Soils occur in a fairly wide variety in our country, as will be seen from the
soil map of India given in Fig. 4.1. Some of the major soil types found in the country are:
Alluvial soils: These are mostly found in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Generally, these are composed of broadly matching fractions
of sand, silt and clay, and make fair to good subgrade material.
Fine sand:
It is confined mostly to desert areas in the north-western part of the country. This soil lacks binder fraction and is not
well graded.
Coastal soils: The sands/sandy soils forming the coastal alluvium usually make good subgrades.

Black Cotton (BC) soils: Black cotton soils occur in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.
These soils are characterised by pronounced volume changes (swelling upon wetting and shrinkage after drying) and low
strength at high moisture content.
Red gravelly soils: The moorums and red gravelly soils are found in various pockets and are generally less problematic.
The wide range of soil types available as highway construction materials have made it obligatory on the
part of the highway engineer to identify and classify the different soils. The classification of soil as per IS
nomenclature (IS: 1498-1970), the general range of the maximum dry densities of these materials and their
approximate CBR values are given at Table 4. 1

Marginal/low grade materials
: Surveys carried out in the country for different types of low-
grade material encountered in the country reveal that there is a wide variety of marginal/low grade materials,
which can be used for advantage in road construction. Usually marginal materials can be adopted for construction
of sub-base/base courses and for shoulders. The distribution of a wide variety of naturally occurring low-grade
materials/soft aggregates can be broadly categorised as:
(i)
Moorum/Gravel
(li)
Kankar

*Shows the availability of different types of material
The properties and suitability of some of these marginal materials under different climatic condition are
given below:
Pit Gravel/Moorum: These materials are available under moderate overburden of topsoil consisting of natural mixture of
granular and fine soil fraction. These may be sub-angular, round in shape and irregular in size. These are suitable for rural road
construction, particularly for base/sub-base course and as binder material
in water bound macadam (WBM) and can be used in
all climatic conditions.
Laterite: Laterites are generally deep brown in colour.
It is porous and spongy and hence absorbs water and becomes soft. Care
should be taken to use this material
in humid and cold climate.
Kankar: Kankar is generally nodular in shape and derived from lime stone rock. Certain varities of kankar are quite resistant to
crushing. These are suitable in all climatic conditions.
Dhandia: Dhandia
is a calcareous material under over-burden of desert sand varying from
1 .5 m to 2.5 m and are suitable for
all climatic conditions.

PAGE 97 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Soft Stone/Sand Stone: The soft stone namely sand stone, limestone, etc. are found all over the country. These are sedimentary
rocks softer than hard rocks like granite and quartzite. These aggregates are more susceptible to stripping when they come in
contact with water. Therefore, these aggregates should not be used under heavy rainfall areas.
River Gravel: River gravel found in stream and river bed are normally rounded in shape. This material can be used in sub-base
course.
River Shingle: They possess smooth surface and are rounded in shape. When used in base/surface coarse river shingle should
possess at least two broken faces.
Compressed Shale Aggregates: The aggregates produced from stratified shale rock are quite tough when dry but their strength
fall appreciably once they come in contact with water. Care should be taken under humid and cold climate.
Brick Aggregates: These are suitable for all climatic conditions.

Stabilised Soils
Sometimes soil/soil-gravel/aggregates and waste materials such as fly ash, iron and steel slag and other
such materials, available in the near vicinity of the construction sites do not conform to the
1 grading, PI and
strength requirements. Such inferior materials can be improved by adopting soil stabilisation technique. The
methods of stabilisation can be broadly grouped as:
Mechanical stabilisation
Lime stabilisation
Cement stabilisation
Bituminous stabilisation
70



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
4.5.1.
Mechanical
stabilisation
: This work consists of improving the inferior soils/low grade
aggregates like kankar, latente, brick aggregates, moorum, etc. by blending them with locally available suitable
materials. Different methods of proportioning two materials on the basis of the gradation or/and plasticity
index are given in Appendix-4.1.
4.5.2. Lime stabilisation
: When the local soil, moorum cannot be economically and effectively stabilised
by mechanical methods, the chemical stabilisation of these materials are resorted to.
Lime stabilisation
is
normally adopted for silty clays and clayey soils including black cotton soil. The development of strength in
soil lime mixes depends on the type of clay and its quantity in soils. Thus, lime stabilisation is recommended
for soils having PI > 8. It is desirable that the calcium hydroxide content (available lime) in lime for stabilisation
should be more than 70 per cent.
In case of inferior lime the quantity of lime for stabilisation has to be
increased proportionately. Lime with purity less than 50 per cent should not be normally used. Lime shall be
properly stored to avoid prolonged exposure to the atmosphere. The quantity of lime to be added as percentage
by weight of the dry soil shall be specified in the contract. The mix design shall be done to decide the optimum
quantity of lime to be added to obtain required test value. Before stabilisation soil shall be pulverised by using
disc harrow, rotavator till 100 per cent matenal passes through 26.5 mm sieve and 80 per cent through 5.6 mm sieve.
4.5.3. Lime-Fly ash stabilisation
: This method is suitable for areas where good quality of fly ash and
lime are locally available and the local soils respond to these techniques.
Normally, soils having medium
plasticity index (5-20) and clays that do not respond to lime can be improved by this technique. Details of this
technique are given in Chapter 9.
4.5.4.
Cement
stabilisation
: Gravelly, sandy, clayey type of soils can be stabilised using cement,
when comparatively higher and faster development of strength, and durability characteristics are needed
especially for waterlogged and high rainfall areas. The material used for stabilisation by cement shall be gravelly
or sandy type of soil. Marginal materials like kankar, laterite, brick aggregate, crushed rock or slag or any
combination of these can also be stabilised using cement. For use in sub-base and base course, the material
shall have grading as shown in Table 4.6.
It shall have a uniformity coefficient not less than 5 so that
it can
produce a well closed surface finish.
Cement shall comply with the requirement of IS:269-1989, 455-1989, 81 12-1989 or 1489-1991 details
of which are presented later in this chapter. The quantity of cement to be added as per centage by weight of the
dry soil shall be specified in the contract. Also if lime
is used as pre-treatment for highly clayey
soil, the
quantity as per centage by weight of dry soil shall be specified in the contract. The quantities of lime and
cement must be determined on the basis of unconfined compressive strength and durability tests under 12
cycles of wet-dry conditions. Generally cement concrete ranges from 3 to 5 per cent by weight of dry soil.

If the material passing 425 micron sieve is plastic, it shall have a liquid limit not greater than 45 per cent
and plasticity index not greater than 20 per cent as per IS:2720 (Part 5)- 1985. For the treatment of the plastic
soil, the stabilisation shall be as per Section 4.5.3. For further details reference may be made of IRC:50.
4.6.
Road Aggregrates
4.6.1.
General
: Aggregates form the major portion of pavement structure and they are the most
voluminous ingredient used in pavement construction. Aggregates have to bear the stresses due to the wheel
loads on the pavement and on the surface course. They also have to resist wear due to abrasive action of traffic.
Most of the road aggregates are obtained from natural rocks. The conventional road aggregates in India are
obtained by crushing of rocks. There are three mam groups of rocks: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Within these three broad geological classes, there are hundreds of different types of rocks. Many of these rocks
differ little from each other with regard to their road making qualities. The map showing rocks and minerals
found in India is given in Fig. 4.2. The desirable properties of road aggregates are given below:
Strength: The aggregates to be used in road construction should be sufficiently strong to withstand the stresses due to
traffic wheel loads; hence they should possess sufficient strength to resist crushing.
Hardness: The aggregates used in the wearing course are subjected to constant rubbing or abrasion due to moving
traffic. They should be hard enough to resist wear due to abrasive action of traffic.
Toughness: Aggregates in the pavements are also subjected to impact due to moving wheel loads. The resistance to
impact or toughness is hence another desirable property of aggregates.
Durability: The stones used in pavement construction should be durable and should resist disintegration due to action of
weather. The property of stones to withstand the adverse action of weather is called soundness.
Shape of the aggregates: Aggregates which happen to fall in a particular size range may have rounded, cubical, angular,
flaky or elongated shape of particles. It is evident that the flaky or elongated particles will have less strength and durability
when compared with
cubical, angular or rounded particles of same stone. Hence too flaky and too much elongated
particles should be avoided as far as possible.
Adhesion: The aggregates used in bituminous pavements should have less affinity to water.
4.6.2.
Natural aggregates
: The most commonly available rocks in India from which road aggregates
can be obtained are given in Table 4.7.
4.6.3.
Artificial aggregates
: Artificial or manufactured aggregates have been used widely for road
construction in the developed countries.
In some parts of India, brick soling or WBM construction using brick
ballast have been widely used. As the properties of these artificial aggregates are dependent on various factors,
the quality of final products vary too much necessitating elaborate evaluation of their properties before utilisation.
The types of artificial aggregates available in the country are
:
Brick ballast:
It is the hand broken aggregates of well burnt or over burnt bricks free of extraneous materials.
Cinder:
It is well burnt furnace
residue, which has been fused or sintered into lumps of varying sizes.

Aggregate for Base Course
4.7.1.
General
: WBM is one of the commonly used pavement layers. It can be used for construction
of
sub-base or base course. The size of the coarse aggregate depends upon the thickness of the layer. The
strength of the layer depends on the interlocking and lateral confinement of the layer. The grading requirements
of the screening are given in the Table 4.8.

4.8.
New Materials and Stabilisers
4.8.1.
Geotextiles
: Synthetic materials in the form of strong flexible sheets either woven or non-
woven and permeable or water tight membranes have been used for several years to improve soil quality and
performance in different branches of geotechnical engineering, e.g., lining, drainage and protection of slopes
and embankments. Such materials are called geotextile. Natural man made textiles, such as, jute fabrics, coir
mats are also being used extensively m many civil engineering projects and such materials can also be adopted
in rural road construction. The geotextiles are generally classified by the manufacturing process, and are often
separated into two sub-categories, namely non-woven and woven. Other types of geotextiles include (i) Knitted
geotextiles (ii) Directionally structured filament (iii) Composite geotextiles.
In a given application, a geotextile can perform one or several functions to improve the mechanical and/
or hydraulic behaviour of the structure in which it is incorporated. Filtration/Dramage and separation functions,
which are two important functions of geotextiles, are described in the following lines. The separation function
refers to the separation of two dissimilar materials. The primary
geotextile
responsibility
is to prevent
intermixing of the two different soil layers or dissimilar materials; throughout the design life of the structure.
Normally geotextiles provided for separation in road pavement prevent intrusion/pumping of soil particles into
the base/sub-base course. Geotextile are commonly used for this function when pavements are constructed
over soft soils.
Roadway pavements are basically structures for taking the high contact pressure from the
vehicle tyres and reducing that pressure through the depth of the pavement to a level, which can be handled by
the underlying soil. Pressure dissipation occurs down through the various layers ofmaterials withm the pavement.
Over a period of time, especially in presence of water, repeated vehicle load applications cause subgrade soils
to migrate into the aggregate base of the pavement section. Contamination of the aggregate base by the subgrade
results in the reduction of the effective base thickness to a value, which is less than what was the design value.
Reduction of the base thickness results in a decrease in the load carrying capability of the aggregate base and
leads to a reduction in the pavement life.
Geotextile prevent the subgrade materials from migrating into the
aggregate base, while maintaining the desired strength over a much longer period and as a consequence the
quality and the life of the pavement is increased substantially.
Filtration is one of the most widely used geotextile functions. For centuries, Engineers have constructed
filter systems using conventional graded aggregates. A geotextiles provides filtration function which serves the
same role in soil structures as were the various gradation of aggregates conventionally used. The filtration
77



======================================================================
PAGE 106 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
function has two concurrent objectives.
These are to retain the particles of the soil while permitting water to
pass freely through the plane of the geotextile from the soil. These two parallel roles are the key to filtration
design. For the filtration function, a geotextile must be able to convey a certain quantity of water across the
plane of the fabric throughout its design life to prevent the build up of water pressures. Further details regarding
Detailed specifications of geosynthetics, geotextiles etc. and their use in sub-surface drains with installation
specifications are given in MoRT&H Specification and IRC:59.
Natural fibres, like, jute and coir are also used for making Geotextiles. Availability
of natural jute in
India in abundant quantity gives
the natural fiber based fabrics an advantage
in terms of cost.
Jute
is a
lignocellulosic natural fiber and as such is biodegradable. There are various application areas where the presence
of fabrics is either required for a short duration or where the degradation of fabric does not hinder its application
function. In such cases,
it is advisable to go for natural materials rather than synthetic materials, as they are
available locally and cheap. Fibre drains made up ofjute composites are used for consolidation of soft clays.
Jute being 100 per cent biodegradable is the only environmental friendly drain and is acceptable even in the
developed countries. These drains are versatile and can be used as:
(i)
Vertical drains for consolidation of clays
(ii)
Horizontal drains for stabilisation of slopes and
(iii)
Horizontal drains to counter the problems arising due to seepage
When jute geotextiles is laid over the subgrade
it reduces the possibility of failure by performing the
following functions:
(i)
The fabric acts as a separator betw een the subgrade and the granular sub-base and prevents the migration of the particles
from subgrade to the sub-base material
(ii)
The highly permeable nature of geotextiles helps in rapid removal of water from the road section and thus prevents the
pumping action of the pavement
In the same manner, coir is also used for drainage and erosion control. The resistance to biodegradability
of coir is better than jute.
4.8.2.
New stabilisers
: Many type ofnew stabilisers are now available. Some of these are chemical/
enzyme based compounds. Use of such materials can be taken up initially on experimental basis to establish its
efficacy.
4.9.
Materials for Desert Areas
Road construction in sandy areas is confronted with many serious problems notable among them being
the non-availability of hard stone metal. Since stone has to be brought from long distances, the cost of construction
at such places is very high. It has been observed that in desert areas, on account ofnon-cohesive nature of sandy
subgrade, the oversize metal has a tendency to sink in the subgrade resulting in the deformation ofroad surface.
It is, therefore, essential to provide adequate support to prevent deformation.
The detailed survey of soils and road construction materials carried out in sandy areas has shown that a
variety of materials, such as, Dhandla (a calcareous material), Kankar, soil grave! mixes and Bentomte (heavy
clays) are available at many locations. Research work carried out at various laboratories and subsequent laying
of test tracks and its field performance have shown that these materials can be used both in the sub-base and
base course of road pavement in place of hard stone metal.

Material for Bituminous Construction
4.10.1.
General
: Bitumen is a viscous liquid, semi-solid or solid material, colour varying from black
to dark brown, having adhesive properties, consisting essentially of hydrocarbons derived from distillation of
petroleum crude or natural asphalt and soluble in carbon disulphide. Bituminous materials used for paving
purposes can be grouped as illustrated below:

Requirements for good bituminous binder
: The bituminous binder should posses the
following qualities as per IS:73-1992:
Adequate viscosity at the time of mixing and compaction
Not highly temperature susceptible
Should not strip off from aggregate in presence of water
4.10.3.
Tests for bituminous binders
: To ensure that the required properties are available in the
bituminous materials standard tests are performed. These tests can be divided into four categories
:
•
Consistency tests
•
Composition tests
Specific gravity tests
Flash and fire point tests
These tests as required for quality control are described in Chapter 10.
Consistency tests
: By consistency is meant the resistance of a material to flow. Temperature changes
for bitumen ranges from its processing temperature ( 1 77°C) to the road surface temperature during winter. As
a single test cannot be adequate for evaluating all bituminous binder, a number of tests have been developed;
each of which has certain advantages and disadvantages.
The consistency tests of importance are:
Penetration test (IS: 1 203- 1 978)
Viscosity test (IS: 1206-1 978)
Softening point test ((IS: 1205-1978)
Ductility test (IS: 1208- 1978)
Composition tests
: Most bituminous binder specification includes criteria regarding composition. To
ensure these compositions are met, a number of tests have been developed to determine the proportion of
79



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
specific fractions and components of the bituminous binders. The more common tests in this category are:
Loss on heating test
(IS: 1212-1 978)
Solubility test (IS: 1216-1978)
Water content test (IS:
1 2
1
1 - 1 978)
Distillation test
(IS: 105 12-1 983)
Spot test (AASHTO T:
1 02-74)
Specific gravity test
: The specific gravity of refinery penetration grade bitumen varies between
1 .00
and 1.05. Specific gravity data are required to calculate the percentage of voids in an aggregate-binder mix.
Moreover, while the specifications provide the quantities in weight, the material supplied and measured in use
by volume. The test may be performed as per IS: 1202- 1978.
Flash and fire point test
: These are primarily safety tests, but also indicate the volatile substances
present in the binders indirectly. Of the two tests, fire point test is more important as it indicates the maximum
temperature to which bituminous material can be safely heated. The test may be performed as per IS: 1209-
1978.
4.10.4.
Bitumen emulsion
: Bitumen emulsion is a liquid product in which a substantial amount of
bitumen is suspended in a finely divided condition in an aqueous medium and stabilised by means of one or
more suitable materials. In India normally cationic type of emulsion
is used. An emulsion
is a two-phase
system consisting oftwo immiscible liquids; bitumen being dispersed as fine globules in water. A small proportion
of an emulsifier is used to facilitate dispersion and to keep the globules of dispersed binder in suspension. The
function of this emulsifier
is to form a protective coating
around
the
globules
of
binder resisting the
coalescence of the globules. The bitumen content in emulsions
is around 60 per cent and the remaining
is
water. When emulsion is applied on the road, it breaks down resulting in release of water and the mix starts to
set.
The time setting time depends upon the grade of emulsion. The first sign of breakdown of emulsion is
indicated by the change in colour of the film from chocolate brown to black. Three types ofbituminous emulsions
are available, (i) Rapid Setting (RS), (li) Medium Setting (MS), (iii) Slow Setting (SS). If the bitumen emulsion
is intended to break rapidly, the emulsion is said to possess rapid set quality. Emulsions which do not break
spontaneously on contact with stone, but break during mixing or by fine mineral dust are medium set grades.
When special types of emulsifying agents are used to make the emulsion relatively stable, they are called slow
setting. The viscosity values of bitumen emulsions when tested using Sabolt Furol Viscometer are given in
Table 4.12. IS:8887-1995 may be referred for specification on bitumen emulsion for roads.

Polymer modified bitumen/crumb rubber modified bitumen
: Certain additives or blend
of additives called as bitumen modifiers can improve properties of bitumen and bituminous mixes. Bitumen
treated with these modifiers is known as modified bitumen. Polymer modified bitumen (PMB)/crumb rubber
modified bitumen (RMB) should be used only in wearing course depending upon the requirements of extreme-
climatic variations as given in Table 4.13. The detailed specifications for modified bitumen are given in
IRC:SP:53. It must be noted that the performance ofPMB and RMB is dependent on strict control on temperature
80

during construction. The advantages of using modified bitumen are as follows:
Lower susceptibility to daily and seasonal temperature variations
Higher resistance to deformation at high pavement temperature
Better age resistance properties
Higher fatigue life for mixes
Better adhesion between aggregates and binder
Prevention of cracking and reflective cracking.

: The material is similar to WBM except that some
key aggregates and lean dose of bitumen replace the moorum and water. In this treatment, 40 mm hand broken
metal is used. Though hand broken metal is preferred about 30 per cent quantity can be replaced with 40 mm
crusher broken metal. The gradation for 40 mm metal has to conform to 100 per cent passing 50 mm sieve and
fully retained on 25 mm sieve. Also, 12 mm size key aggregates are used. The gradation for 12 mm metal has

Materials for Bituminous Surfacing
4.11.1.
Prime coat over granular base
: This work shall consist of application of single coat of low
viscosity liquid bituminous material to an absorbent granular surface preparatory to any superimposed bituminous
treatment or construction. The choice of bituminous primer shall depend upon the porosity characteristics of
the surface to be primed as classified in IRC: 16. These are:
(i)
Surface of low porosity; such as wet mix macadam and water bound macadam.
(ii)
Surface of medium porosity; such as cement stabilised soil base.
(iii)
Surface of high porosity; such as a gravel base
The different ranges of viscosity requirements for the primers to be used for different type of surfaces to

restricted only for sites at sub-zero temperature or for the emergency applications as directed by the Engineer.
4.11.2.
Tack coat
: Tack coat application consists of a single coat of low viscosity liquid bituminous
material to an existing road surface preparatory to another bituminous construction over it. It is used to create
a bond between an existing surface and a bituminous overlay. The binder used for a tack coat shall be bitumen
emulsion complying with IS:8887- 1 995
. The cut-back being environmentally hazardous,
its use should be
limited to exceptional cases where emulsion cannot be used due to sub-zero temperature.
4.11.3.

: The binder shall be straight run bitumen or bituminous emulsion of a
suitable grade appropriate to the region, traffic, rainfall and other environmental conditions and conforming to
IS:73-1992. The details of the choice and construction method are given in Chapter 8. The physical requirements
of aggregates shall remain the same as given in Table 4.15. The size of stone chipping shall be in accordance
with Table 4.16.

(i)
A
less viscous paving grade bitumen such as 80/100
is normally used for easy and uniform spraying and providing
sufficient time during which viscosity does not build up. This ensures proper coating and embedment of aggregates
sprayed on hot bitumen.

(ii)
In many parts of India, the period of bituminous construction, specially surface dressing work
is confined mainly to dry
summer months. The working period
is thus often limited to six to seven months in a year. However,
it can be extended
for construction
in winter months by controlling viscosity of bitumen according to prevailing atmospheric/pavement
temperatures.
(iii)
Paving grade bitumen 60/70 may be used for roads in coastal region where temperature
variation
is less than 20°C.
(iv)
Paving grade bitumen 80/100 may be used for rural roads in entire north India
and part of peninsula excluding coastal
regions.
More viscous grade ofbitumen is advantageous in reducing stripping ofbitumen film from aggregates in
the presence of water. With rounded river shingles, more viscous grade of bitumen compensates to some extent
for poor mechanical interlock.
4.11.4.
Premix carpet
: The binder shall be bitumen of a suitable grade appropriate to region, traffic,
rainfall and other environmental conditions as directed by the Engineer and satisfying the requirements of
IS:73-1992, 217-1988, 454-1994 or other approved emulsion and cut-back as applicable. The physical
requirements of aggregates shall remain the same as given in Table 4.14. The stone polishing value as measured
by BS: 812 (Part
1 14)-T989
shall not be less than 55. Large scale field trials conducted on premix carpet under
different climatic condtions have given a broad indication for selection of appropriate grade ofpaving bitumen
as follows:
(i)
For traffic intensity of less than 500 CVPD (commercial vehicles per day) and temperature variation through out the year
is less than 25°C, paving bitumen 60/70 may be preferred.
(ii)
In areas where difference between maximum and minimum atmospheric temperatures
is more than 25°C and traffic
intensity is less than 500 CVPD, paving bitumen 80/100 may be used.
(iii)
Paving bitumen 80/1 00 may be used in high altitude and snow-bound regions irrespective of traffic intensity.
(iv)
For premix work in cold weather with atmospheric temperature below 20°C use of cut-back bitumen MC-3 is suggested.
Cut-back bitumen MC-3 may be used in mixes with less quantity of fine aggregate, while cut-back bitumen SC-3 may be
used in mixes with appreciable quantity of fine aggregates.
4.11.5.
Seal coat
: The characteristics ofbinder for seal coat should be the same as specified above for
premix carpet. In case of open graded premix carpet construction, the surfacing layer should always be sealed
with a layer of seal coat. Seal coat may be either liquid seal coat (Type A) or sand seal coat (Type B). Type A
seal coat shall be used for high rainfall areas (over 1000 mm rainfall per annum) and type B seal coat for other
climatic conditions.
4.11.6.

: Suitability ofbitumen and emulsion for different
types of bituminous work is given in tabular form in Tables 4.17 to 4.21.

4.12.
Materials for Semi-Rigid Pavement
4.12.1.
Dry lean concrete
: Dry lean concrete (DLC) is a semi-rigid material used for base course
construction having distinctly superior load dispersion characteristics as compared to conventional granular
bases and sub-bases,
like, WBM.
As such, smaller thickness of this material can be used to replace the
conventional base and sub-base courses in flexible and rigid pavement construction.
Besides superior load
dispersing properties DLC is resistant to softening action of water and can serve as a good working platform on
softer foundations.
It would be particularly useful as a base/sub-base course in areas where good quality
aggregates are not available.
4.12.1.1. Materials for DLC
Cement: Ordinary Portland Cement conforming to IS:269-1989 or IS:81 12-1989 or Portland pozzolana
cement (PPC) covered by IS: 1489 (Part 1)-1991 can be used.
Aggregates: Coarse aggregates shall consist of clean, hard, strong, and durable pieces of crushed stone
or crushed gravel and shall be complying with IS:383- 1970. Brick bats and low grade aggregates can also be
used in DLC, however in selecting the aggregates, strength requirement stipulated in (mix design criteria)
should be kept in view. The maximum size of the coarse aggregate in the mix is limited by the thickness of
DLC layer to be laid, and should not exceed 40 mm for 10 cm layer thickness.
The maximum size of the
aggregate should preferably be 20 mm. Use of higher size aggregates may lead to segregation of the concrete
mix. Restricting the higher size of the aggregate to 25 mm would yield better results. The fine aggregate shall
consist of clean natural sand or crushed stone grit or a combination of the two and shall conform IS:383-1970.
Fine aggregate shall be free from soft particles, clay, shale, loam, cemented particles, mica, organic and other
foreign matter. Continuously graded or gap graded aggregates may be used, depending on the grading of fine
aggregates. The combined grading of coarse and fine aggregate should be within the limits given in Table 4.22.
In case of marginal aggregates, higher per centage of fine aggregates is desirable to act as a cushion for weak
aggregates during rolling.

Water: Water is an essential ingredient used in mixing of concrete. It should be free from harmful oil,
acids, alkalis, salts, sugar, organic materials or other substances that may be deleterious
to concrete or steel.
The pH value of water shall generally be between 6 to 8. Potable (drinking water) is generally satisfactory for
mixing and curing of concrete. Water found suitable for mixing is also suitable for curing, pH shall not be less
than 6. Permissible limits of solids in water are given in Table 4.23.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Fly ash: Fly ash can be used to replace a part of fine aggregate in DLC. Details of fly ash usage in DLC
are given in Chapter 9.
4.12.1.2. Proportioning of dry lean concrete
: The mix proportions of DLC are designed by trial and
error method.
As compaction is to be done by rolling, workability shall be kept low, 0-10 mm slump.
The
cement content in DLC shall not be less than 150 kg per cubic metre of concrete. The average compressive
strength of a group of 5 cubes shall not be less than 10.0 MPa at 28 days. In addition, the minimum compressive
strength ofany individual cube shall not be less than 7.5 MPa at 28 days. While selecting the trial mix proportions,
allowance should be made for the maximum size and shape of the aggregate, as increase in the maximum size
of the aggregate and its surface area requires reduction in water content; similarly change from angular crushed
aggregates to rounded aggregates and increase or decrease in fineness modulus of sand requires a change in
sand content.
The design mix complying with the strength requirements shall be got approved by the engineer and
demonstrated in the trial length construction. The optimum water content (OMC) shall be determined and
demonstrated by rolling during trial length construction. The right amount of water for DLC shall be decided
so as to ensure full compaction under rolling. Too much water will cause DLC to be heaving up before the
wheel and picked up on the wheels of the roller and too little water will lead to inadequate compaction, low in-
situ strength and open textured surface. While laying DLC should have moisture content within OMC +
1 per
cent, keeping in view the effectiveness of compaction and to compensate for water absorption and evaporation
losses.
4.12.2.
Lime fly ash concrete
: Details of usage of lime fly ash concrete are presented in Chapter 9 in
accordance with IRC: 60.
4.13.
Materials for Rigid Pavement
4.13.1.
Cement concrete pavement
: Cement is a material obtained by pulverising clinker formed by
calcining raw materials, primarily consisting of argillaceous and calcareous materials. The argillaceous materials
used are shale or clay.
The calcareous material commonly used
is limestone. These materials supply the
essential components such as lime (CaO), Silica (SiOJ, Alumina (A1,0
3
) and iron oxide (Fe,0
3 ). Cement,
when mixed with water, forms a paste, which hardens and binds the particles of aggregates together, to form a
hard durable mass called concrete. Ordinary cement is called Portland cement because of the resemblance of
set cement to rock found on the English island of Portland. Cement shall be stored in a dry place and subjected
to acceptance tests prior to its immediate use. Cement to be used may preferably be obtained in bulk form.
Cement shall be stored in a covered place to prevent its deterioration or contamination by foreign matter and to
ensure its satisfactory quality and fitness for work.
If a lot or batch of cement is not used for two months, fresh
tests shall be carried out to ascertain its suitability for use. As per IS:456-2000, a part of cement to the extent of
10-25 per cent can be replaced with fly ash provided required compressive strength is achieved. Before using
any cement
it would be advisable to get the cement tested for the following main properties to determine
whether these properties meet the requirements as per IS standards:
Fineness [IS:4031 (Part 1,2 & 15)-1996, 1999, 1991]
Setting time [IS:4031 (Part 5)-l 988]
Soundness [IS:403
1 (Part 3)-
1 988]
Compressive strength [IS:403
1 (Part 6)- 1 988]
The pavement design shall conform to the provisions of IRC:58 and IRC: 15.

4.13.1.1. Types of cement
: In India, the BIS has classified Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) into three
grades. Grade of cement refers to 28 days compressive strength in MPa. The specifications of three different
grades are given below:
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) Grade 33
1. Compressive strength of cement sand mortar (IS:269-1989) not less than
72
+
1 hours
=
16 MPa
168 + 2 hours

2. Fineness (sqcm/gm) not less than
= 2250
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) Grade 43

(IS: 81 12-1989) not less than
72
+

672 + 4 hours
= 43 MPa
2. Fineness (sqcm/gm) not less than
= 2250
Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) Grade-I (Fly ash Based)
This cement may be used in construction of base or sub base course under flexible or rigid pavement.
This type of cement is preferable to use in mass concrete works and under coastal environment for longer life
of the
pavement. The specification for this cement is given below:
1. Compressive strength of cement sand mortar
[IS: 1489 (Part
1 )- 1 99 1 ] not less than
168 +2 hours
= 22 MPa
672 +4 hours
= 33 MPa
2. Fineness (sqcm/gm) not less than
= 3000
3. Fly ash/calcined clay
= 10-25 per cent
Blast Furnace Slag Cement
This type of cement is preferable to use in concrete works under coastal environment. The specifications
for such cement are given below:
1. Compressive strength of cement sand mortar (IS:455-1989) not less than
72
+
1 hours
=
15.7MPa
168 + 2 hours
=
21.6 MPa
2. Fineness (sqcm/gm) not less than
= 2250
3. Slag (Ground granulated slag)
= 25-65 per cent
4.13.1.2
Aggregates for concrete
: The bulk of the material that forms concrete, is stone aggregates.
Thus, the properties of concrete and its costs are controlled very closely by the quality and cost of aggregates.
Aggregates for concrete are classified as fine aggregates and coarse aggregates. Fine aggregates are those
which pass 4.75 mm sieve, and coarse aggregates are those which are retained on 4.75 mm sieve. The Indian
Roads Congress specifies that the maximum size of the aggregates should not exceed l/4
,h of the pavement
thickness. Fine aggregates are generally obtained as natural sand from river beds. They can also be obtained by
crushing stone and gravel. Coarse aggregates can either be (i) uncrushed gravel, or (ii) crushed stone or gravel,
87

IRC:SP:20-2002
or (111) a blend of the two. As per IS:456-2000 other types of aggregate such as slag and overburnt brick, which
may be found suitable with regard to strength and durability of concrete as well as
free from harmful contents
may be used for plain concrete. The aggregate should not contain more than 0.5 per cent of sulphate as SO, and
should not absorb water more than 2 per cent of their own weight.
The aggregates should be hard, strong, dense, durable, clean and free from adherent coating; they should
not have injurious amounts of disintegrated pieces, alkali, vegetable matter and other deleterious substances.
As far as possible, flaky and elongated pieces should be avoided. Aggregates should not contain harmful
quantities of materials such as pyrites, coal, lignite, mica, shale or similar laminated material, clay alkali, soft
fragments, seashells as these can affect the strength or durability of concrete. Generally fly ash and Lithium
Chloride to some extent prevent harmful alkali-aggregate reaction. Aggregates are typically stored in separate
piles according to gradation and the area must be free draining and free from deleterious matter.
In case the
engineer considers that the aggregates are not free from dirt, the same shall be washed and dried for atleast 72
hours before batching.
Cement concrete in pavements is subjected to high flexural stresses and abrasion. The aggregates must
therefore be able to provide the needed strength and quality, to resist these external forces. Strength is measured
by the aggregates crushing test and the aggregates impact test.
Abrasion
is measured by the Los Angeles
Abrasion test [IS:2386 (Part 4)-1963]. The strength requirements of coarse aggregates are as given in Table
4.24. In case of concrete having reinforcement, maximum size of aggregate should also not exceed l/4th of the
minimum clear spacing between reinforcing bars. The maximum size commonly used should preferably be
20-25 mm.

Water
: Water used for mixing and curing of concrete pavement shall conform to the
requirements given in Section 4.12.
4 13.2.
Roller compacted concrete pavement (RCCP)
: Roller compacted concrete is a zero-slump
Portland cement concrete which is compacted using a road roller. There are several differences between roller
compacted concrete (RCC) and conventional Portland cement concrete. The most apparent is the lower water
content or RCC. The lower water to cement ratio results in higher strength than conventional Portland cement
concrete. In addition, it allows the use of roller for compaction, which would otherwise get bog down in wetter
concrete. Other notable differences are that RCC usually has a lower paste content. When used as an alternative
material m pavements, RCC has several advantages like:
Speed of construction
Lower cost
Use of fly ash as an essential ingredient
Expansion joints not required

USeS fRCC Pavements were primarily for heavily loaded pavements such as parking lots, goods
shed, eta This is because RCC can provide a suitable surface tolerance, adequate for moderate traffic speeds
It it is to be used as wearing course, it is best suited for low and medium traffic volume roads. In case smoother
overlay is proposed to be laid as wearing course, RCC can be used for construction of all categories of roads

Materials for Roller Compacted Concrete are given below:
Cement:
Cement conforming to IS:269-1989 or IS :81 12-1989 or
IS:
1 2269-1 987 can be used. Portland pozzolana cement
(PPC) covered by IS: 1 489-1 991 can also be used, however in that case, fly ash or any other pozzolanic material shall not be
used to replace part of cement.
Aggregates: Coarse aggregate for RCC shall be from natural aggregates complying with IS:3S3-
1 970. They shall consist of
clean, hard, strong, dense, non-porous and durable aggregates derived from crushed stone or crushed gravel and shall be devoid
of pieces of disintegrated stone, soft, flaky, elongated and highly angular pieces. The maximum size of coarse aggregate should
be preferably limited to 20 mm in order to avoid a harsh pavement surface and segregation during transport and placement. The
engineer may permit use of aggregate of upto 25 mm size,
if field trials are satisfactory
The fine aggregate shall consist of clean natural sand or crushed stone grit or a combination of the two and shall conform
IS:383-1970. Fine aggregate shall be free from soft particles, clay, shale, loam, cemented particles, mica, organic and other
foreign matter. The combined grading of coarse and fine aggregate shall conform to gradation given
in Table 4.25.

Fly ash: Eventhough roller compacted concrete can be made without using fly ash, use of fly ash in roller compacted concrete
has many advantages. Details of usage of fly ash usage in roller compacted concrete are given in Chapter 9.
Water:
Water used for mixing and curing of roller compacted concrete shall be clean and free from injurious amounts of oils,
salts, acid, etc.
It shall meet the requirements given
in Section 4.
1 2.
4.14.
Materials for Special Pavements
4.14.1.
Concrete block pavement (CBP)/interlocking concrete block pavement (ICBP) :CBP/ICBP
consists of a surface layer of brick-sized concrete blocks paved on a thin, compacted bedding sand layer of
specified grading, which is spread over a properly profiled base course and is bounded by edge restraints. The
joints are sealed with joint filling sand, also of specified grading. The block layer is embedded into the bedding
sand by vibratory compaction.
In CBP rectangular blocks are used which are non-mterlockmg when paved,
while m
ICBP blocks with curved vertical faces are used, which have enhanced interlocking effect when
paved. Paving quality concrete is used for production of precast blocks and edge restraints. Ordinary Portland
Cement/Portland Pozzolana Cement/Portland Slag Cement meeting relevant specifications are used as binder.
Good quality natural coarse and fine aggregates meeting the specification requirements as per IS:383- 1 970
should be used in concrete. Industrial waste products like fly ash, slag, etc. meeting relevant specifications can
also be used as additives. Potable water should be used for making concrete mix. Concrete blocks are normally
produced using properly designed cement concrete mix. However, the blocks so produced should have equivalent
28-days strength as per design requirements.
Concrete blocks are produced using properly designed cement concrete mix and using electro-hydrauhcally
operated Block Making Machines (BMMs), in which heavy metallic moulds are used in combination with
compaction heads. Different moulds are used for different shapes of blocks. The desired density and strength is
achieved by vibratory compaction and hydraulic pressing. Fresh blocks are produced on metallic or wooden
pallets. In the context of rural roads, wherever BMMs are available, the same can be used for production of
89



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
blocks. Where such infrastructure cannot be arranged, manual or semi-automatic hydraulic presses can be
utilised for the same. In such cases the choice of block shapes should be based on simplicity in fabrication of
moulds. Manual or power-driven mixers can be used for preparation of concrete mix. For curing of blocks,
curing tanks with adequate capacity for holding 2 weeks
1 production of blocks are required. When such facility
cannot be arranged, curing by wet gunny bags or hessian cloths can be adopted. Blocks produced in BMMs/
hydraulic presses should be allowed to self-cure under ambient temperature for 24 hours during mild season
and 12 to
1 8 hours during summer. After that they should be transferred to curing tanks or stacked in neat rows
and cured with wet gunny bags/hessian cloths. It is necessary to cure the blocks for 28 days to achieve the full
strength potential of blocks. However, under inevitable circumstances curing for 14 to 28 days may also be
allowed. Proper quality control should be exercised in production of blocks, so that they achieve the expected
strength and durability requirements. The pavement design requirements for CBP/ICBP are given in Chapter 5.
4.14.2.
Stone-sett pavement/brick-on-edge pavement
: Stone-sett pavement consists of hard stones
paved on a bedding sand layer provided over compacted subgrade of base course, bounded by edgestones.
Locally available hard stones are generally used for the purpose. Irregular quarry stones or stones cut to regular
sizes can be used, provided the surface evenness requirement is not a precondition. The types of stones normally
used are granite, basalt, sandstone and limestone. Depending upon the quality of stones used, stone-sett pavement
can be expected to have a life of 20 years or more. Bnck-on-edge pavement consists of a layer of burnt-clay
bricks (placed on edge) paved over a thm bedding sand layer provided over compacted subgrade or base course
in the desired paving pattern, and bounded by edge restraints for which the bricks themselves can be used. High
quality bricks can be produced by preparing clay with high (20 per cent) lime content, moulding them in steel
forms and firing at high temperatures. While normal brick pavements can be expected to serve for 10 years,
pavements constructed with lime-mixed bricks can have a life of upto 20 years.
4.15.
Climatic Suitability of Concrete Materials
4.15.1.
Selection of constituents of concrete
: Cement concrete
is the major component of semi-
rigid and rigid pavement and special pavement construction. Concrete is mainly composed of sand and crushed
rock or other aggregates, held together by a hardened paste of hydraulic cement and water. The ingredients of
concrete are thoroughly mixed in pre-selected proportions, resulting in a plastic mass which can be cast/moulded
into a predetermined shape and dimension to construct semi-rigid and rigid pavement for rural roads. Semi-
rigid and pavement quality concrete and roller compacted concrete pavements are suitable for the regions
where annual rainfall is more than 1000 mm and soil is very clayey/silty (CBR 2-3 per cent). Depending upon
the availability of funds, as the semi-rigid or rigid pavements are about 50 to 70 per cent costlier than flexible
pavements, the choice must be exercised with extreme caution for any extreme condition.
Further, to reduce the cost of these pavements, fly ash shall be used as replacement of portland cement
by 10-25 per cent (by weight)
in
semi-rigid and rigid surface. For use in the wearing course 50 per cent sand
can be replaced by fly ash (by weight) in semi-rigid pavement construction (either for base/sub-base or wearing
course), if fly ash is available in a reasonable reach. The use of fly ash shall be guided by IRC:68 and IRC:SP:58.
The details of such construction are given in Chapter 9. However, it is indicated that use of fly ash in concrete
is more advantageous in
tropical, and and semi-arid
environment. Use of fly ash in concrete gives better
performance than plain conventional concrete
in coastal regions where chances of chlorides and sulphates in
the ground water or soil are more and air temperature
is reasonably high.
Cement
is the binding material for most of semi-rigid and rigid pavements. A wide variety of cements
are available now-a-days, and their suitability
in relation to five different exposure conditions
is given
in
90

Mechanical Stabilisation
Correctly proportioned material (aggregate and soil) can be adequately compacted to form a mechanically
stable pavement layer. This method is called mechanical stabilisation. Thus the basic principles in this method
of stabilisation are: a) Proportioning and b) Compaction. If a granular soil containing negligible fines is mixed
with a certain proportion of binder soil,
it is possible to increase the stability. Similarly the stability of a fine-
grained soil can be considerably improved by mixing a suitable proportion of granular material to get a desired
gradation.
Mechanical stabilisation has been successfully applied for sub-base and base course construction. It has
also been used as a surface course for low cost roads such as village roads when the traffic and rainfall are low.
The desirable properties of soil aggregate mixtures are strength, incompressibihty, less changes in volume and
stability with variations in moisture content, good drainage, less frost susceptibility and ease of compaction. It
is generally believed that the stability of a soil-aggregate mix can be increased by increasing its dry density.
Hence proportioning of mixes is done to attain maximum dry density
.
The following are the recommended values of the liquid limit and plasticity index for the material passing
425 micron sieve, to be used for mechanical stabilisation

Design of mechanically stabilised mixes
The factors to be considered in the design ofmix are gradation, density, index properties and stability. Of
these, the gradation is the most important factor. The particle size distribution that gives maximum density is
generally aimed at. Fuller's formula may be used to obtain the theoretical gradation for maximum density and
is given by:
P= 100 (d/D)

P

CHAPTER
5
PAVEMENT DESIGN
5.1.
Introduction
The road structure may be divided into four major components, viz., land, earthwork, pavement and
cross drainage works. The pavement constitutes nearly one-third to one-half of the total cost of the road.
Therefore, very careful consideration should be there for the choice of the type ofpavement and its design. The
factors which govern the selection of the type of the pavement are:
(a)
Initial (construction) cost
(b)
Availability of good materials locally
(c)
Cost of maintenance or rehabilitation during service
(d)
Technology of construction required and
its availability
The options available are: (a) flexible pavement, (b) cement concrete pavement, (c) composite pavement
with semi-rigid base with suitable bituminous surfacing, (d) semi-rigid base with surfacing of inter connected
concrete paving blocks, and (e) roller compacted concrete. In India most of the roads are with flexible pavement;
however, the recent trend is of concrete pavement, specially for high density traffic corridors and expressways.
In case of rural roads, m view of the stage development strategy and the
initial cost advantage, the
flexible pavement may be the appropriate choice. However, in special cases, in short sections or in some rural
road projects where the ground conditions and material availability may pose restriction for use of flexible
pavement, the other options like roller compacted concrete, block pavements and composite pavements may be
cost effective. Generally the choice of pavement will be further guided by several other factors, such as
(a)
Rainfall and temperature
(b)
Type and strength of soil along the alignment
(c)
Availability of good aggregates
(d)
Availability of industrial wastes (like, fly ash, slag, etc.) in the proximity
Thus, based on the above guiding principles, practically the choice can be exercised by the Engineer
appropriately to economise in the overall cost of the project without compromising the quality in any manner.
The importance of pavement design, even for rural roads, cannot be overemphasized. While it appears
that rural roads will not have traffic intensity or axle loads as compared to higher categories of road, even small
number of commercial vehicles (or tractor-trolley) with heavy axle loads or iron-tyred animal drawn cart may
cause heavy damage
to an underdesigned pavement.
It
is due to
this single most important reason that a
considerable length of rural roads built every year using resources of different rural development programmes
failed prematurely.
Any design using conventional, marginal or waste material must follow standard procedure based on
material property, traffic and design life. There are many associated factors like rainfall, ground water table,
etc. which are also to be taken into account for evolving durable pavement design. In all designs, economy in
the initial cost as well as in life cycle cost are crucial and very important. These aspects assume extra emphasis
in case of rural roads.

5.2.
Design Parameters
5.2.1.
General
: The principal criterion for determining the thickness of a flexible pavement with a
thm bituminous surfacing is the vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade imposed by a standard axle
load of magnitude 8. 1 7 kN (8170 kg). Excessive vertical subgrade strain causes permanent deformation in the
subgrade, which is manifested in the form of rutting on the pavement surface. The maximum rutting that can be
accepted in village roads may be taken as 50 mm before rehabilitation work is needed. Analytical evaluation of
performance of other district roads and village roads on the basis of the vertical subgrade strain criterion has
indicated that the design curves as per IRC:37 are generally valid for the design traffic from 0. 1 million standard
axles (msa) to 2 msa. However, for design of rural roads, the design charts have to be simple and convenient for
the grass-root level agencies. Road Note 29 of TRL, IRC:37 and experience in India suggests that the charts
may be for the traffic in the range upto 450 CVPD. Since subgrade CBR may be as high as 20 per cent, design
curves are also prepared for subgrade CBR up to 20 per cent. The minimum recommended pavement thickness
is 150 mm even when design chart gives lower thickness. For rigid and semi-rigid pavements tensile stress is
taken as the design criteria to prevent fracture of the concrete layer within the design period.
In case of
concrete block pavements, vertical subgrade strain
is the critical criterion to limit rut depth due to traffic
loading.
5.2.2.
Traffic
:
For the purpose of structural design, only the number of commercial vehicles of laden
weight 3 tonnes or more should be considered. To obtain a realistic estimate of design traffic, due consideration
should be' given to the existing traffic and its rate of growth.
In case of new construction, anticipated traffic,
possible changes in the road network and land use of the area served as well as the probable growth of traffic
over design life are to be carefully accounted for. If adequate data is not available, an average value of 6 per
cent may be adopted
for traffic growth rate. The traffic study for the road may be carried out as per the IRC:9.
5.2.3. Design life
: Design life is usually defined as the number of years until the first major reconstruction
is anticipated. For unsurfaced roads, aggregates are displaced on either side of the wheel path and frequent
blading is necessary to maintain a good riding surface. For unsealed/unsurfaced roads aggregates are often lost
due to traffic action as well as
erosion by rains, and the pavements become thinner with time. Material lost
must be replenished periodically to maintain the ndeability
. It is necessary that sufficient thickness is provided
to prevent rutting failure during the design life due to high vertical subgrade pressure. It is considered appropriate
that roads in rural areas should be designed for a design life of 10 years. The thin bituminous surfacing that is
commonly provided on the low volume roads has a life of about 5 years.
5.2.4.
Computation of design traffic
: The design traffic is considered in terms of the future
traffic
to be carried during the design life of the road. Its computation involves estimates of the initial volume of
commercial vehicles per day, traffic growth rate and design life in years.
In case of rural roads the commercial
vehicles will be trucks (small and big), buses and tractor-trolley. The traffic for the design life is computed as:
Where
A =
P
(
] + r
)
n+x
A = Number of commercial vehicles per day for design
P = Number of commercial vehicles per day at last count
r = Annual growth rate of commercial traffic
/; = Number of years between the last count and the year of completion of construction
.V = design
life in years
Since the width of rural roads
will be single lane, design traffic should be based on total number of
commercial vehicles per day in both directions. Bullock carts with iron rims are still in use in different parts of
95



======================================================================
PAGE 124 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
the country
and the total weight including the pay load of a bullock cart may range from
1.0 tonne to
1.5
tonnes. Though the designed pavement as a whole will be safe from shear failure, the iron rims damage the top
layer of the pavement because of high concentration of stress. Thus the wearing course must be made up of
good quality aggregates with aggregate impact value not exceeding 30 per cent to reduce degradation of the
aggregates by crushing.
5.3.
Pavements Compont.-cs
5.3.1.
Subgrade
: In rural roads, the top 30 cm of the cutting or embankment at the formation level
shall be considered as subgrade. The subgrade, whether in cut or
fill, should be well compacted to utilise its
inherent strength and prevent permanent deformation because of additional compaction by traffic. A minimum
of 100 per cent of Standard Proctor compaction should be attained in the top 30 cm of the subgrade. For clayey
soil, the minimum compaction for subgrade should be 95 per cent of Standard Proctor compaction and the
compaction should be done at moisture content 2 per cent in excess of the optimum value. For embankments,
the soil below 30 cm of subgrade shall be compacted to minimum 97 per cent of Standard Proctor compaction
[IS:2720 (Part 7)- 1980]. For pavement design, the subgrade strength should be determined in terms ofCBR at
the most critical moisture conditions likely to occur. The CBR test should be conducted on remoulded samples
prepared at optimum moisture content and dry density corresponding to Standard Proctor compaction [(IS:2720
(Part 7)- 1980] and soaked in water for four days prior to testing. If the annual rainfall is of the order of 500 mm
or less and the water table is too deep, soaking for four days may not be necessary.
One or two CBR tests should be done per kilometre depending on the variation of soil type. If there is no
variation in soil type, mean CBR value should be adopted for the design of pavements. In case of existing roads
requiring strengthening, the soil should be moulded at the existing moisture content and field density, and
soaked for four days prior to testing foi CBR.
Where the CBR of the subgrade is less than 2 per cent a capping layer of 100 mm thickness of material
with a minimum CBR of 10 per cent is to be provided in addition to the sub-base required for CBR of 2 per
cent. If the subgrade CBR is more than 15 per cent, there is no need to provide a sub-base. WBM base can be
laid directly over the subgrade after providing a drainage layer (inverted choke).
5.3.2.
Sub-base
: Sub-base is a layer of selected material placed on the subgrade compacted to 98 per
cent of the IS heavy compaction. Generally it consists of locally available, relatively low strength inexpensive
material. The principal function of the sub-base is to distribute the stresses over a wide area of the subgrade
imposed by traffic and to ensure that no subgrade material intrude into the base course and vise versa. There are
a large number of locally available aggregates and industrial waste materials that can be utilised for sub-bases
of pavements. These are discussed in Chapters 4 and 9.
The sub-base material should have minimum soaked CBR of 15 per cent. Material component of sub-
base passing 425 micron IS sieve when tested in accordance with [IS:2720 (Part 5)-1985] should have liquid
limit and plasticity index not more than 25 and 6 respectively. These requirements should be enforced to
achieve desired quality.
When the subgrade
is silty or ciayey soil and the annual rainfall of the area
is more than 1000 mm, a
drainage layer of 100 mm over the entire formation width should be provided conforming to the gradation
given in Chapter 6. This layer will form a part of the designed thickness of sub-base.
5.3.3.
Base
:
The base course materials should be of good quality so as to withstand high stress
concentrations which develop immediately under the wearing surface. Since
bituminous surfacing consists
96



======================================================================
PAGE 125 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
only of a thin wearing course, the upper surface of the base must be sufficiently smooth and true to profile to
provide a good riding surface. The different types of base course which are commonly used are:
(a)
Water Bound Macadam (WBM)
(b)
Crusher-Run Macadam
(c)
Dry Lean Concrete
(d)
Soft Aggregate Base Course
(e)
Lime-Fly Ash Concrete
Thickness deduced from the design charts are appropriate to pavements with unbound granular bases
which comprise of conventional WBM or any other equivalent granular construction. For cement treated or
stabilised materials, thorough laboratory investigations are necessary and the pavement design can be done
using analytical method. In some situations where good quality aggregates are not available, cement treated
low grade aggregates or soils may also be used. Appropriate agency may be approached for laboratory
investigations and design.
It is recommended that normally no material with CBR value less than 100 per cent should be used in
base courses. Since base course will be affected by water, their strength should be determined in soaked condition.
Where a substantial part of the base material consists of particfes larger than 2Q mm size, the CBR test will not
be applicable and their strength will have to be estimated from experience. WBM of adequate thickness over a
properly designed sub-base will be assumed to satisfy the CBR requirements of 100 per cent. The design of
base courses of different types are given in subsequent Sections.
5.3.4.
Pavement surface
: Pavement can be with a sealed or unsealed surface. The unsealed surface
means a granular surface where percolation of water into the pavement layers is possible, whereas in sealed
surface it is prevented by appropriate surfacing layer. Details of the design or choice of surfacing are given in
Section 5.4.2.
5.4.
Design of Flexible Pavement
5.4.1.
Pavement thickness
:
The thickness ofpavement is designed on the basis ofprojected number
of commercial vehicles for the design life using the current commercial vehicles per day and its growth rate.
Further,
it requires the subgrade strength value in terms of CBR.
It
is expected that rural road will not have
more than 450 CVPD in any case. The design chart given
in Fig.
5.1 may be referred to obtain the
total
pavement crust thickness (granular crust thickness) required over the subgrade for the design life of the pavement.
Based on the strength of granular materials that are used, the total design thickness is divided into
base and
sub-base thicknesses. However, any other higher type ofbituminous layer can be part of the designed thickness,
with the exception of thin bituminous surfacmgs (PMC, MSS, etc.). In case of rural roads, with low volume of
traffic, structural layer of bituminous mix need not be provided, generally except in very special cases where
the traffic volume is so high that the design suggests
it.
For the convenience of engineers the whole range of traffic and CBR that exist for rural roads in various
States of the country have been considered and flexible pavement thickness catalogues are given
in Figs. 5.2,
5.3 and 5.4 for ready reference. A worked out example for design of flexible pavement for rural road is given
in section 5.4.3.
5.4.2.
Surfacing
: A gravel road or WBM layer can serve adequately as a surfacing depending on
traffic volume. However, it is to be clearly understood that granular materials (like, soil-gravel mixture) will be
lost gradually by traffic action and thickness will be reduced. Therefore, for gravel roads extra thickness should
be provided. Further, for similar reasons, only WBM Grade-Ill should be used as a surfacing course for an
unsealed WBM road. Other granular surfacmgs, like, Moorum, Kankar, etc. will have to be bladed as and when
required to provide smooth riding surface.

The bituminous wearing course will generally consist ofpremix carpet with seal coat or two coat surface
dressing laid over WBM base course or other type of bases. Bituminous wearing course must be made up of
good quality aggregates v/ith aggregate impact value not exceeding 30 per cent in order to reduce degradation
of the aggregates by crushing. Use of bituminous emulsion for such work may give good surfacing because of
processing of material at ambient temperature. Maintaining the right mixing temperature of the hot mix is not
easy when the dampness of aggregates stacked at the sites varies. Based on the total motorised traffic and
rainfall, an appropriate surface course can be chosen from Table 5.1

Design of Semi-Rigid Pavement
5.5.1.
General
: Semi-rigid materials have modulus of elasticity less than pavement quality concrete
(rigid pavement material), but more than bituminous materials. The flexural strength of semi-rigid materials is
generally between
1 .0 to
1 .2 MPa. These materials are used as base course under flexible or rigid pavements. In
case of rural roads, 20 mm thick bituminous layer of premix carpet with seal coat or 20 mm thick mix seal
surfacing or surface dressing may be applied over the semi-rigid base as the abrasion resistance of semi-rigid
materials is very less as compared to pavement quality materials. The 28-days compressive strength of semi-
rigid material varies from 5 to 10 MPa. These materials have better capability of load distribution and more

flexural rigidity than WBM. Therefore, these are suitable for heavy rainfall areas or where soil is very weak. In
areas where good quality aggregates are not available, DLC made from pit-run gravel, river gravel and other
low grade aggregate may provide an economical solution. Commonly used semi-rigid materials are dry lean
concrete, lime-fly ash concrete and other cementitious materials. The maximum single layer thickness ofDLC
to be compacted should be 100 mm.

Dry lean concrete base
: Dry lean concrete base is subjected to flexural fatigue under traffic
loading. Design charts of semi-rigid bases for different subgrade CBR and various traffic levels are shown in
Fig. 5.6. A granular sub-base, 100 to 150 mm thickness to full width of formation should be laid below the
cement bound layer to provide a working platform and also to act as a drainage/filter layer. The DLC is likely
to be eroded under traffic and requires bituminous wearing course of premix carpet with seal coat or two coat
surface dressing.

Worked out Example
A pavement is to be constructed in an area where only pit-run gravel is available at a low cost. Design
data is the same as in the worked out example in Section 5.4.3. A mix consisting of cement, sand and aggregates
in the ratio of 1:6:12 has a 28-days flexural strength of 1.1 MPa.
Design traffic (projected) = 54 CVPD
For subgrade CBR = 4
From Fig. 5 .6, thickness of cement treated base = 285 mm
The pavement section will consist of a thm bituminous wearing course and 285 mm cement treated base
over 100 mm of drainage/filter layer.
5.5.3.
Lime-fly ash concrete and other cementitious bases
:
In areas close
to thermal power
plants where fly ash is available in plenty, fly ash stabilised bases can give a low cost pavement. Pozzolanic
materials are known for their durability. They gam in strength with time. Various properties of different types
of fly ash aggregate mixtures are given in Chapter 9. Combinations which give flexural strength higher than
1 .0 MPa may be used. Lime-rice-husk-ash mixtures as described therein may also be used. Marginal aggregates
can also be used in these mixes. These types of base courses require a drainage layer below
it. A bituminous
wearing course is necessary to prevent erosion of the stabilised bases. Compaction shall be done till the density
achieved is at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density as per IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983. Method of construction
of these fly ash bases and their curing shall be as per the requirements specified in Chapter 9. The design chart
given in Fig. 5.6 can be used to design the thickness of lime fly ash concrete. A wearing course of premix carpet
with seal coat or surface dressing shall be provided on such bases.
5.6.
Design of Rigid Pavement
5.6.1.
Cement concrete pavement
:
Design of cement concrete pavement shall be as per IRC:58
and construction including detailing of joints shall be as per IRC: 15. Strict quality control shall be exercised
during construction. Cement concrete pavement may be used in special cases only where drainage problem is
acute and continuous. In cases of deficient design and construction, their design life
is likely to be greatly
affected. The cement concrete pavement may be used in limited length within the village portion. However,
drainage arrangements should be ensured even for concrete pavement.
5.6.2.
Roller compacted concrete pavement (RCCP)
: RCCP is a technique which makes use of
laying zero slump concrete manually and compacting with vibratory or static road roller of 8- 1 0 tonnes capacity.
RCCP may be used in areas where there is drainage problem. These roads must be constructed under
strict supervision and quality control. In cases of deficient design and construction, their design life is likely to
be greatly affected. Construction ofRCCP is a faster technique than the construction of plain cement concrete
using conventional method of compaction,
i.e., screed vibrator/needle vibrator.
The mix design shall be based on flexural strength. Flexural strength achieved usually exceed those for
conventional concrete with similar cement contents.
Flexural strengths of even 4.5 MPa can be achieved.
Initial rate of strength gam of RCC may be slower when compared to the same mix of plain cement concrete.
Consequently, designs based on more than 28 days strengths would be appropriate depending on the available
lead time prior to opening to traffic. While designing the mix in the laboratory, correlation between flexural
and compressive strengths of concrete shall be established on the basis of tests on samples for use at a later date
to verify the in-situ flexural strength of RCC though testing on cores.
Considering the variations in the field.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
the laboratory mix shall be designed for atleast 1.25 times the required 28 days field strength. Laboratory mix
design can be carried out as per IRC:44. Due to low water content of RCC, amount of fines required is more
than normal concrete.
This helps to reduce segregation. The fines are typically supplied by fly ash.
An
additional benefit is gained from the pozzolanic property of fly ash, which contributes to strength of RCC.
Generally the fly ash content in RCC pavements has been upto 25 per cent of total cementitious ingredients,
with typical contents being about 15-20 per cent.
The concrete used in RCC work would be usually having zero slump. Modified Proctor compaction test
can be used for determining the optimum moisture content for compaction or trials may be made with RCC to
have optimum strength. This test would also indicate maximum achievable density of the mixture, against
which field densities can be compared. The right amount of water for the RCC pavement work shall be decided
for ensuring full compaction.
Excess water will cause the concrete to heave in front of the roller wheels,
resulting in uneven compacted surface while too little water will lead to inadequate compaction, low in-situ
strength and an open textured surface. The optimum water content, as determined in laboratory trials, shall be
adjusted during construction at field by trial rolling a small stretch. The variations in water content in the mix
shall be +
1 per cent from the specified value.
The design of RCCP and DLC (which
is almost similar to RCCP except for strength of concrete)
are based on IRC:58. Construction of RCCP shall be as per IRC: 15. The mam difference in construction using
pavement quality concrete (conventional concrete pavement) and RCCP is of compaction and making ofjoints.
In RCCP, the compaction of zero slump concrete is done by road roller of 8-10 tonnes capacity. The methodology
for construction, design, placing, curing are the same as compared to
conventional concrete pavement. The
slump of concrete is always kept as minimum as possible so the RCCP can take the load of moving roller even
during construction. A worked out example of RCCP is given in Appendix-5.1.
5.7.
Design of Special Pavements
5.7.1.
Concrete block pavement/interlocking concrete block pavement (CBP/ICBP)
: The general
features and requirements of CBP/ICBP are given in Chapter 4. The concrete mix for production of blocks
shall be properly designed. M-30 or higher grade concrete shall be used for production of blocks meant for
paving roads carrying traffic. For non-traffic areas like footpaths, 60 mm thick blocks using M-25 or higher
grade concrete may be used. For convenience in design of mix, one or two ready mixes can be used by trial and
error method. For precast edge restraints, M-25 or higher grade concrete shall be used. A typical dimension of
precast edge restraint is 150 x 150 x 300 mm. The top surface area of blocks shall ideally be in the range 200-
500 cm
2
. The breadth-to-length ratio for rectangular blocks may be
1 :2. Rectangular blocks should have length
in the range of 200 to 220 mm and^width in the range of 100 to 110 mm. The colour of the blocks can be natural
cement colour, or special colours can be effected by using organic or inorganic pigments. This technique will
give a distinct and beautiful look to the paved area. The thickness of blocks for use in trafficked areas shall be
80 mm.
The thickness of granular base course for CBP/ICBP can be obtained from Fig. 5.7. Cement treated
marginal aggregates may also be used as a base course, the thickness of which shall be 67 per cent of the
granular base course required. Lime-fly ash bound macadam and lime-fly ash concrete may also be used as
base layer, the thickness of which also shall be 67 per cent of the base course. Minimum thickness of base
course shall be 100 mm. A good drainage layer must be provided over the compacted subgrade for satisfactory
performance of CBP/ICBP.

thickness. Cobblestones available from river beds can also be used for paving. The type of stones normally
used are granite, basalt, sandstone and limestone. For brick pavement, burnt clay bncks or bricks having minimum
28 days compressive strength of 7 MPa can be used. Bricks are laid on edge over bedding sand. The stones/
bricks themselves can be used as edge restraints. Stone sett/bnck-on-edge pavement as surfacing layer shall be
used only for areas having very poor drainage and pedestrian pathways.
5.8.
Drainage and Shoulders
The performance of a pavement can be seriously affected if internal drainage measures (sub-surface
drainage) to prevent accumulation of moisture in the pavement structure are not provided, particularly when
rainfall
is more than 1000 mm per annum. Though elaborate drainage measures are not warranted for low
traffic volume, it is advisable to provide a drainage layer of dust-free coarse to medium sand of 100 mm to 150
mm thickness over the subgrade
if the subgrade
is clayey (and impermeable) particularly in areas having
higher rainfall (more than 1000 mm), as illustrated in Fig. 5.8. The washed coarse to medium sands have
permeability values in the range of 10" 2 to 10~4 centimeter per second respectively. Crushed aggregates, Jhama
bricks or crushed gravels as per typical grading given in Chapter 6 may also be used as a drainage layer.
Particles finer than 0.075 mm should be less than 5 per cent to ensure adequate permeability.

CHAPTER 6
ROAD DRAINAGE
6.1.
Introduction
The main objective of drainage
is to prevent early damage of the pavement due to entry of excess of
water and preventing saturation upto a depth of 1 meter below the top of the subgrade. This can be achieved by
proper design of the pavement which includes effective drainage system. An adequate drainage design includes
the control of rain or surface flow and also the underground seepage or water held by capillary action (soil
suction).
Various types of damages arising due to inadequate drainage are:
Considerable reduction in the bearing capacity of subgrade soil due to excess of moisture, resulting in premature failure
of pavement.
Pavement failures like potholes, rutting, waviness and corrugation
in flexible pavement.
Reduction
in strength of many pavement materials,
like, stabilised
soil and water bound macadam due to increase of
moisture content.
Damages to shoulder and pavement edges from
surface water.
Considerable erosion of the soil from the substrata, slopes of embankment, cut and hillside due to surface water.
Therefore, an adequate drainage is required for maintaining the structural and functional adequacy of the
road. In India, unfortunately not as much attention
is being paid to drainage, as
it deserves, with obvious
dangerous consequences. It has been conclusively established that if drainage of the pavement is improved, the
cost of the maintenance/repair goes down considerably. It is estimated that cost of drainage measures works
out to 3 to 5 per cent of the total cost of the construction. This small investment for drainage provisions at the
initial stage pays rich dividend in the service period. Providing drainage measure at latter stage is both difficult
and expensive, and therefore, proper provisions for adequate drainage should be made at the initial construction
stage itself.
6.2.
Types of Road Drainage
The road drainage woks may be broadly classified as under:
(i)
interception and drainage of surface water (Surface Drainage)
(ii)
Interception and rapid removal of seepage or subsurface water (Sub-surface Drainage)
These guidelines deal with drainage of rural roads running through plain, rolling and hilly terrains. The
aspects covered are influence of alignment and geometric of the road, surface drainage, sub-surface drainage
and internal drainage of pavement structures. For rainfall less than 500 mm per annum, no internal drainage of
pavement is required. It may be noted that some aspects of hill road drainage are also covered for the details of
which relevant IRC specifications/guidelines may be referred. Moreover, detailed design and specifications on
CD works have been presented in Chapter 7.
6.3.
General Criteria for Road Drainage
Alignment of Road
: The alignment of road has vital influence on the problem of drainage. The ideal
alignment should avoid steep and heavy cut/ fill, as these locations are vulnerable to drainage problems.
Embankment Height
: The road subgrade level
in
fill section
is to be fixed so that the difference
between formation level and highest water table/high flood level is not less than 0.6 meter, and between formation
level and ground level not less than
1 .0 meter.

6.4.
System of Drainage
,
In general the road drainage is catered by both surface and sub-surface drainage systems, for which a
survey and field investigation should be carried out.
It may include:
(i)
Preparation of alignment plan, longitudinal section, contour map
(ii)
Hydrological data, such as, rainfall and estimation of runoff
(iii)
Hydrographical survey
(iv)
Geotechnical investigation
6.5.
Surface Drainage System
The fast disposal of runoff on the road surface is achieved by surface drains or roadside drains or catch
water drains.
6.5.1.
Geometric design of road
: Providing camber on one side or both sides, proper slope to the
shoulder and providing requisite longitudinal gradients, etc. disposes water from road surface.
6.5.1.1. Longitudinal gradient
: The longitudinal gradient serves the natural means for drainage of
rainwater collected over the road surface. Internal drainage through granular layers needs, a longitudinal gradient
of 0.3 per cent for its effectiveness.
6.5.1.2.
Pavement cross slope/camber
: If a road is to perform adequately, care must be taken to
remove the surface runoff by suitable cross falls, which will be helpful in minimizing ponding of the water.
Therefore, higher than minimum cross fall/camber should be adopted where possible by the following means:
Cross fall or camber may be made to slope on one side in case of hilly areas to drain the surface water on the carriageway
towards the hillsides where the gutters on both sides are not feasible.
When the road is on a gradient,
it is desirable that the camber should not be less than 50 per cent of the longitudinal gradient
subject to minimum of specified camber. This is essential to ensure the surface water to reach the shoulders quickly.
Recommended camber or cross slope on straight section of roads is given m Table 6.1

Surface drains
: The water from road and adjacent area shall be collected and lead away to
natural out falls. This is achieved by surface drains:
(i)
Drain along the side of the road (gutter)
(ii)
System of suitable drains, such as, shoulder drains
(iii) Deep catch water surface drain on the hillside
6.5.2.1.
Road side drains
: The function of roadside drain is to collect surface water from the roadway
and lead
it to an outlet. Another function of roadside ditches is to dram out the base course of the roadway
structure so as to prevent its saturation and consequent loss in load bearing capacity as illustrated in Fig. 6.1
. In
absence of properly designed roadside ditches, the surface water from the roadway, as well as water collected
from cut slopes accumulates, causing serious damage by erosion to the roadway, as well as formation slopes.

(b)
Function of Side Drains
Fig. 6.1. Cross-Section and Function of Side Drains
The side drains are designed on the principles of open channel flow, and generally provided on both
sides of the road. In case of hilly terrain, side drains on hillside are made when road is built in cut section. They
should be provided below the subgrade of the road.
Roadside drains in hilly terrain are constructed to parabolic (saucer shape), trapezoidal, triangular, V-
shape, kerb and channel or U-shaped cross-sections. The parabolic section is hydraulically the best and most
erosion resistant. However, the trapezoidal section is easier to construct and is generally adopted. U-shaped
drains are generally deep drains and are provided where higher discharge has to be catered and road width is
available. Extra width will be available when kerb and channel drains are provided. Details of various types of
side drains are shown in Figs. 6.2 and 6.3.

The lining of side gutters is a costly proposition, and therefore, judicious selection of the type of lining is
very essential.
It is more cost effective and desirable to provide bigger size gutter (section) than any lining.
Bigger section reduces damages to the pavement and also reduces the maintenance liabilities.
To estimate the runoff at a given location, the Rational formula relating rainfall to runoff is used for
catchment areas not exceeding 50 sq.kg. The formula states that:

The selection of roadside drain
is based on magnitude and duration of flow. The hydrological data
required for design of gutter are drainage area, water shed delineation, direction of flow, location of outfalls,
ditches, other surface drainage facilities, ground surface condition, rainfall and flood frequencies. The roadside
drains are designed on the principle of flow in open channel based on Manning's formula which states that:

Procedure for design of side drain is generally in the following steps:
Find discharge using rational equation
Find area of cross-section using allowable velocity of side drain
Find slope of side drain using Manning's formula
Longitudinal slope should not be less than minimum slope of 0.5 per cent if side drains are lined and
1 .0 per cent if they are
unlined as
specified in IRC: 73- 1980 "Geometric Design Standards for Rural Highways"
IRC:SP:42 "Guidelines on Road Drainage" may be referred for detailed hydraulic design of the drain.
However, the tentative salient design features of roadside drains (gutters) given below may be adopted in
absence of any data.

The rectangular or trapezoidal section causes a sense of danger to the motorist travelling close to it, but
triangular section is most appropriate and widely used.
An unlmed dram can withstand only a limited amount of discharge without erosion problem. The problem
will be severe in silt and sand when the velocity of flow is between 0.3 to
1 .0 m/sec. In stiff clay this velocity
may be
1 .5 m/sec. But in all cases the permissible velocity of flow can be increased significantly by lining the
dram. Also by lining the side slopes (of drain) can be made steep. An unlined cross-section of drain may require
4: 1 to 2: 1 side slope, but a section with brick lining can be rectangular. Generally, in rural roads turfing is done
in the roadside drains to prevent (soil) erosion of unlined drains. However, suitability can be improved by
adopting different types of lining in side drains as given in Table 6.4.

6.5.2.2.
Shoulder drainage
: Drainage from shoulder is ensured by properly maintaining the surface
of the shoulder with specific camber. Shoulder should be shaped regularly before and during the monsoon, in
order to avoid damages to the road pavement. A shoulder normally consists
of granular material. However
stabilised shoulders are preferred in case of clayey soil. Alternatively, following measures may be adopted
when shoulders are of impervious material, like, clay or black cotton soil, such as:
(i)
Laying of continuous drainage layer of 75 mm to 100 mm thick under shoulder at the bottom level of sub-base as shown in
Fig. 6.4.
(ii) Extending the sub-base/base course with drainage material
in the entire formation width upto the edge of formation and
provide a generous cross slope to permit rapid drainage as shown in Fig. 6.5.
( iii) Provision of shoulder drains at 4 to 10 metres centre to centre as shown in Fig. 6.6.
(iv) Shoulder with hard material, like, granular or stabilised soil to affect good drainability.
The cross slope of the shoulder should be
1 per cent steeper than the cross slope of carriageway subject-
to minimum of4 per cent. At times super elevation creates certain problems for the shoulder slopes on horizontal
curve. In such stretches, shoulder on inner side of the curve should have a somewhat steeper slope than the
pavement and shoulders on the outer side of the curve through shoulder drains. In case of earth shoulders with
low permeability, i.e., black cotton soil, the drainage should be improved by providing shoulder drains. Shoulder
drains provided at a spacing of 5 to 10 metre centre to centre as shown in Fig. 6.6 are preferred.
6.5.2.3.
Catch water drains
: These drains are provided on hill slopes to intercept water flowing from
upper reaches and guide such flow towards culverts. Such drains should be provided in suitable hill slopes as
shown in Figs. 6.7 to Figs. 6.9. The catch water drains may be simple gutters at suitable location at top of the
slope and leading to natural watercourses. These drains of trapezoidal shape should be stone lined and cement
pointed with a stone masonry wall to retain the slopes.

DRAINAGE LAYER
IN BANKING
Fig. 6.4. Provision of Drainage Layer
6.6.
Sub Surface Drain
Changes in moisture content of subgrade are caused by fluctuations in ground water table, seepage,
percolation of rainwater and movement of capillary water and even water vapour. Hence, it should be ensured
that variation in moisture content in the subgrade
is kept as minimum as possible. The type of subsurface
drainage depends on the topography, depth and fluctuations in the ground water level and the type of subgrade.
Various measures that can be adopted at a specific situation are described below:
Continuous drainage layer should be laid over the entire formation width below the sub-base/base course
as per gradation specified in Table 6.5. In case of fine sand or silt or clayey subgrade or if annual rainfall is
more than 1000 mm, a continuous layer of drainage material is required for the entire width of the formation as
shown in Fig. 6.4.

the engineer should apply discretion and it should be restricted to maximum of
10 per cent.

Rural roads with existing water bound macadam/gravel surfaces, drainage may be improved by providing
aggregate drains m the shoulder as per Clause 309.3.7 ofMoRT&H Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
It is recommended to lower the water table by providing subsurface dram (longitudinal) for relatively
permeable soil subgrade and transverse drains for relatively less permeable soil subgrade as shown in Fig. 6.10.
The subsurface dram may consist of perforated pipe or open jointed solid pipe in trench with backfill around it
or
it may be simply a free draining material in the trench without any pipe. The perforated pipes may be of
metal, asbestos, cement etc. The top of trench is sealed by providing impervious cap so that only sub-surface
water may enter the drain. In pipe dram, the internal diameter of pipe should not be less than
1 50 mm. Holes in
the perforated pipes may be formed m one half of the circumference only. Size of the holes may be close to D
size of material surrounding the pipe subject to minimum of 3 mm and maximum of 6 mm. D
g
. denotes size of
.the sieve that allows 85 per cent of material to pass through it. The backfill may consist of sand-gravel material
or crusted stone satisfying the grading of Table 6.6 in case no specific design exercise based on filtration and
permeability criteria has been carried out. The
filter material (backfill material) should be free of organic
material, clay balls and other deleterious material. The filter material is to be laid as per standard practice. The
IRC:SP:42 "Guidelines on Road Drainage" may be referred for detail design of the subsurface drains.

When the soil around the trench
is fine grained (fine silt or clay or their mixture) adopt Class
1 grading. When coarse silt
to medium sand or sandy soil exists then Class
II grading is adopted. When gravelly sand
is present then class III grading
should be adopted.
2.
The thickness of backfill material around the pipe should not be less than
1 50 mm. Therefore, considering that the minimum
diameter of the pipe as
1 50 mm, the width of the trench should not be less than 450 mm.
When the subsurface consists of only free draining material, the dram may be constructed without any
pipe. The trench may be filled with material such as gravel, slag or stone aggregates free from organic and
deleterious substances. This dram is known as aggregate dram. Its grading is indicated m Table 6.7.

The sub-surface dram can be provided with geotextile either along the trench or around the pipe or both.
The geotextile acts as both separation and filtration layer. When geotextile is provided, the filtration requirement
in the grading is not important as far as material on both sides of it is concerned.
Intercepting a seepage zone as shown in Fig. 6.1
1 can be done using horizontal drains. Perforated pipes
are inserted in the hill cuts for removal of the moisture from the soil mass of up hill slope.
If some portions of road is required to be constructed in heavy clayey soils or passing through an area
susceptible to ingress of water, subsoil drains as shown in Fig. 6.12. may be provided in the road.
Sub soil drainage system has to be provided in valley curves as shown in Fig. 6. 1 3
. It consists of a trench
cut across the body of the embankment/affected portion. The trench is filled with good drainage material such
as gravel, sand, shingle, metal etc. A perforated pipe may also be provided in addition to the drainage material.
The trapped moisture shall be drained to the trench bottom and discharged into side drain or outside the formation.

CHAPTER 7
CULVERTS AND SMALL BRIDGES
7.1.
Introduction
In order to adopt uniform standards and to assist the field engineers in providing cross drainage works,
type designs and estimates of culverts ofprobable spans and heights for rural roads are given. These designs are
based on relevant IRC codes and guidelines. This Chapter generally deals with culverts, small bridges and
minor bridges for rural roads, having height from foundation to road top up to 8 m and spans up to 10 m.
Information and details of causeways and submersible bridges are also given.
Standard design of spans 12 m
and 15 m are also given so that unavoidable crossing can be dealt with. The required formation width for rural
roads [Other District Road (ODR) and Village Road (VR)] is 7.5 m. In case of roads of short length connecting
only one village and hill roads, the formation width can be reduced to 6 m.
7.2.
Geometric Standards for Culverts
A Culvert is a cross drainage structure having a total length of 6 m or less between the interface of dirt
walls or extreme vent way boundaries. A minor bridge is a bridge having a total length upto 60 m. A small
bridge on rural road could be generally taken as a bridge of total length between 6 m and 30 m. Submersible
bridges and causeways are the structures, which get submerged during high floods in monsoon for some duration
but are available for traffic otherwise.
7.2.1.
Overall width of CD works
: The overall width of culvert should be equal to the formation
width of the road. In rural roads, the roadway width is 7.5 m in plain and rolling terrain. However from cost and
low traffic point of view 6.0 m formation (roadway width) can be adopted for such roads, which connect only
a small habitation and where length of the road is small. After careful consideration of various issues and with
due consideration of traffic and cost, overall width of culverts and small bridges are given in Table 7.1.

The carriageway width of a CD structure is generally the overall width minus the kerbs and railings
which should normally allow passage of two trains of IRC Class A Loading.
In case of roads with low traffic
intensity, and in hilly terrain where overall width is 6 m, it is adequate to provide 0.25 m wide kerb raised from
slab. Clear width of carriageway in these cases will be 5.5 m.
For pipe culverts on rural roads
it would be desirable to provide 3 pipes of 2.5 m length each, to avoid
cutting of pipes. This will mean that clear width on these culverts would be 7.5 m width minus width of guard
stone or parapet wall.
For buried pipe culverts with embankment of more than
1 m above the pipe, length of
pipe should be suitably increased.
7.2.2.
Siting of culverts on gradient :The cross drainage works should generally be sited on the
straight alignment of a road. If a nalla crosses the road other than at right angle, either a skew culvert should be
provided or, if economical, the nalla should be suitably drained.
If the road at the culvert is in gradient, the
same gradient of road may be provided for deck slab of the culvert. If the culvert
is situated at change of
127



======================================================================
PAGE 156 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
gradient (hump), the profile of vertical curve should be given in the wearing coat on the culvert. In such cases,
the levels of the two abutment caps on either side may not be the same. However, the bearing surface of an RCC or
Stone slab culvert on the abutment should be horizontal. Drawings for RCC skew slab are not given in this Manual.
7.2.3.
Kerb and parapet wall
: Parapet walls of culverts generally consist of either Random Rubble
(RR) or Coarse Rubble (CR) stone masonry in cement mortar
1 :5 or RCC railings of 0.8 m high above kerb. It
is observed that these railings get damaged due to impact of vehicles and repair takes time.
Where overall
roadway is 7.5 m or 6.4 m, the combined width of kerb and parapet is 450 mm as per standards. However, for
6 m wide culverts or bridges, 250 mm wide RCC kerb, 300 mm above road level should be provided. If
considered necessary either pipe railing or guard stones of 200 x 200 mm section projecting 300 mm above
kerb and spaced at 1200 mm c/c may be fixed.
In case of small bridges with 7.5 m and 6.4 m overall width,
parapet may be of Plain Cement Concrete (PCC) railing or brick masonry or of guard stones.
At the end of
parapets and returns, 400x400x600 mm RCC blocks are provided at four corners at the end of returns. Numbering
of culverts and direction of flow can be marked on these pillars.
7.3.
Design Loading
Culverts and bridges of 6 m, 6.4 m and 7.5 m overall widths on rural roads are normally designed for two
lanes of IRC Class A loading with impact Where in exceptional cases single lane bridges are provided, they
may be designed for a single lane of IRC Class A loading with impact.
7.4.
Wearing Coat
Concrete wearing coats have been provided extensively in the past.
However, when the road
is with
bituminous surface,
it is desirable to provide
20 mm thick Premix Carpet (PMC) with a 5 mm thick seal coat
as wearing coat on culverts. If the rural road is not black topped, concrete wearing coat can be adopted for CD
works. For submersible structures, like, arch/vented causeways, cement concrete wearing coat of 75 mm thickness
, must be provided.
7.5.
Name Piates and Numbering of Culverts
Two name plates or plastered surfaces should be provided on the roadside faces of
0.6 m high guard
stone. Numbering of culverts should be done as per practice prevalent in the State. Number of culvert, description
oftype and the direction of flow should be inscribed on the left-hand side end faces of returns in both directions.
In case of pipe culverts, 2 guard pillars of 400x400x600 mm size are provided on left-hand side in either
direction for recording the number of culvert. It is desirable to refer the relevant IRC standards for this purpose.
The culverts are designated in the form of a fraction, the numerator denoting the number of kilometer and the
denominator to indicate the kilometer wise serial number of the structure. For example
1 1/3 indicates the 3rd culvert
between 10th and 11th km stone. The methodology for inscribing numbers on parapets, railings and on stone/RCC
posts has been given, in IRC:7 'Recommended Practice for Numbering ofBridges and culverts. The size of letter shall
not be less than 100 mm high and shall conform to IRC:30 'Standard Letters and Numerals ofDifferent Heights for Use
on Highway Sign's.
7.6.
Design of Culverts (Hydraulic Aspects)
The topography of the land across the country varies widely and conditions may be
dissimilar even
within the same State, depending on the annual rainfall and nature of terrain. The hill streams are flashy in
nature, which need tall substructures to span them. The natural streams in plains and rolling terrains are usually
wide and need longer superstructures with relatively shorter substructures. The man made drains both for
irrigation and industrial use could be low cost structures such as pipe culverts. Since the catchment area varies
128



======================================================================
PAGE 157 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
widely,
it is suggested to estimate discharge of a natural stream by direct measurement.
If it is not possible to
measure, some of the empirical formulae (like, Dicken's and Inglis) listed in IRC:SP: 13 may be referred to fix
the waterway.
In the plains of north-eastern States, the CD works may be
expected to carry a very heavy
discharge necessitating deeper foundations and/or adoption of longer span lengths.
7.6.1.
Waterway area
: The waterway of culvert is given by:
A
= Q/ 10.9
Where
Q
= Catchment area in hectares
A
= Waterway in sq. m.
This formula is generally suitable for culverts with catchment upto 100 hectares.
It is, however, advisable
to determine the actual discharge of the stream by a suitable method, where the catchment is more than 100
hectares.
7.6.2.
Linear waterway
:
It is generally found that the linear waterway for catchment area of
1
square km will be between 4 to 6 m.
Statistical data shows that the relationship between linear-waterway and
the catchment area is given by the following empirical formula.
L
= kVq,
w
^ 7
L w
=
Linear waterway in metre.
Q
=
Catchment area in sq. km.
and K varies from 4 to 6
This formula is not suitable for culverts with a catchment area of less than
1
sq. km.
On the basis of formula in Section 7.6.1, for a catchment area of 1.25 sq. km. (125 hectares) the waterway
works out to be 6 m for a depth of flow of 2 m, as follows:
A
=
125/10.9
=
11.46 sq.m.
L
=
11.46/2.0
*
6.0 m
W
Thus for catchment area less than
1 .25 sq. km (125 hectares), a culvert is required and for catchment area
more than
1 .25 sq. km, a minor bridge is to be provided.
If the depth of water is more say 3.0 m, a culvert of
6 m waterway can be provided up to a catchment area of 2 sq. km, i.e., 200 hectares. These figures are meant for
guidance. The States may fix their own criteria based on statistical data.
7.6.3.
Hydraulic data
: Following data needs to be collected for the design of a culvert
(i)
Catchment area of the stream in hectares.
(ii)
Cross-section of the stream at proposed crossing alongwith L-section of road upto 200 m on either side of the culvert.
(iii)
L-section of nalla (for catchment area more than
1 25 hectares) about 200 m upstream and 200 m down-stream to ascertain
if straightening of the stream
is necessary to fix the location of the culvert.
(iv)
High flood level (HFL).
(v)
Road top level (RTL).
In case of long bridges, the road top level is fixed on the basis of HFL after providing prescribed vertical
clearance and calculated afflux.
In case of culverts, the RTL should not be fixed on the basis of HFL and
vertical clearance alone. The gradient of road
200 m on either side should be examined and the road top level
(RTL) should be fixed such that RTL is not less than the minimum requirement on the basis of HFL.
When the mean velocity of flow is more than 2.6 m/sec protection of entry and exit end is desirable.
Otherwise, stone pitching of bed would be adequate. As per IRC:5 the vertical clearance for CD works varies
from 150 mm to 600 mm as indicated in Table 7.2.

IRC:SP:20-2002
7.6.4.
Road top level
: Most of the work of construction of culvert will be generally on new roads.
Some works may, however, be on the existing roads. Culvert should be constructed simultaneously when the
earthwork of road is in progress, whereby the geometries of the road can be properly provided. In many cases
culverts are taken up after providing the road crust.
This has two disadvantages:
(i)
Practically every culvert becomes a hump on the road and geometries of the road are affected.
(ii)
Duplication of work of consolidation of approaches causes extra cost.
The road top level at culvert should be fixed in advance.
7.6.5.
Minimum span and clearance
: From the consideration of maintenance of culverts,
it
is
preferable that the clear waterway of slab culvert is minimum
1 .5 m and diameter of pipe in case of pipe culvert
is 1000 mm (900 mm internal dia). Culverts of small span or diameter get choked due to silt.
It is not possible
to enter the pipe and carry out inspection and repairs in span or diameter less than the ones given above as the
requirements.
Irrigation pipes do not come under the purview of pipe culverts. Minimum height of soffit of
slab should be
1.5 m above lowest bed level from the consideration of inspection and maintenance. Table 7.2
indicates clearance required for different spans.

(IRC:SP:

7.6.6.
Number of culverts per kilometre
: It is observed that about 2-3 culverts are required per km
length of road depending on the topography.
This may also vary from region to region and guidance can be
taken from statistical data of existing roads.
When the ground generally slopes from one side to another, the
embankment intercepts natural flow of rainwater.
In such cases balancing culverts are provided at the rate of
one per 500 m length of road to avoid water logging. The balancing culvert could be a pipe culvert of minimum
900 mm internal diameter.
7.7.
Types of Culvert
Following types of culverts are generally provided:
(a)
RCC Pipe Culvert
(b)
RCC Slab on Masonry or Plain Concrete Abutment
(c)
RCC Box Types Culvert
<d)
Arch Culvert
(e)
Cut Stone Slab Culvert
(f)
Stone Masonry Scupper
(g)
Vented Causeway
(h)
Submersible Bridge
The
first three types of culverts are most popular across the country. The "Brick/stone masonry arch
culvert is less common these days since the skills necessary to undertake the construction are on the decline.
However, this form of construction is quite suitable for CD works on rural roads.
The design of RCC slab
bridges is well established and many ready to use charts are available with State Governments and IRC:SP:13
130



======================================================================
PAGE 159 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
also provides a large number of them. The design ofbox culvert is simple and the form of construction is sound
from both hydraulic and structural considerations. In Maharashtra, an attempt was made for adoption of PCC
block arch culvert with pre-fabncated concrete blocks of uniform size. A few such arch culverts both in single
and multiple spans were built in the S fate and their performance appears to be satisfactory.
The stone slab
culverts could be adopted for a clear span upto 1.8 m at locations where suitable material is locally available.
Stone masonry scuppers are adopted in the hill States of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand
and Uttaranchal. In many States the vented causeways and submersible bridges are used for wide streams with
low seasonal discharge.
Cost per running metre being low, they are considered to be low cost CD works
although the total length could be as much as 100 m including ramps. Some States, particularly the north-
eastern States, use steel or timber bridges which are not covered in this Manual.
7.7.1.
Height of culvert
: The minimum height of the formation level of the road from the bed level
is required to be as per Table 7.3 in case of pipe culvert.
Table 7.3. Minimum Height of Formation
Diameter (NP, pipes), mm
Height of Formation, m
For 1000 (900 mm internal dm)
1.75
For 1200
2.15
Minimum height in slab culvert will be 1.775 m which include height of abutment (1.5 m) thickness of
RCC deck slabs (0.2 m), wearing coat respectively (0.075 m). There is no difference in height in either slab or
pipe culverts.
7.7.2.
Pipe culvert
7.7.2. 1.
Diameter of pipe
: The cost of slab culvert is less if the foundation is within 2 m from the bed
level, otherwise, pipe culvert is chosen. Although use of 450 mm, 600 mm diameter pipes in CD works was
more popular in low to moderate rainfall regions, from inspection and maintenance point of view, a minimum
of 900 mm (internal) diameter is recommended.
However, taking into consideration the smaller length of
barrel and low embankment heights, pipes of lesser dia, viz, 600 mm or 750 mm may also be used in exceptional
situations. RCC pipes of 300 and 450 mm dia, used for purposes, such as. irrigation/agriculture are to be
considered as mere buried conduits and not as culverts. The pipes for culverts of rural roads shall be of NP
?
type, which conform to IS:458-1989 and can be chosen as per Table 7.4.
Table 7.4. Diameter of Pipe
Catchment Area (Hectares)

Upto 10
1 000 single row

Where the height of embankment on account of geometric consideration of the road is more than 5 m but
the catchment area of the stream is less than 40 hectares, it would be economical to provide a pipe culvert with
2 rows or 4 rows of pipes. The mam advantage in pipe culverts is the speed of construction and good quality of
factory produced pipes. A pipe culvert can be'constructed in 15 days. The only time consuming and costly ite.n
is stone masonry headwall.
7,7.2.2.
Headwall
: In order to reduce the quantum of masonry wall and the cost, the headwalls are
raised up to top of the pipe and 0.5 m parapet wall is provided above it. The length of headwall is equal to four
131



======================================================================
PAGE 160 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
times the diameter of pipe for retaining the slope of earthen bank within
1 (Vertical) to 1.5 (Horizontal). By
restricting the height, the length and section ofheadwall is considerably reduced. Longer headwalls are provided
for wider streams as per site requirements. Pipes are generally 2.5 m or 3 m long. It shall be ensured that the
invert of the pipe is placed 150 mm below the average bed level. Suitably designed RCC face wall (150 mm
thick) can also be used for a single row pipe culvert.
Pipe culvert may prove to be economical where foundation of culvert
is likely to be deeper or in
predominantly black cotton soil area; and where foundations are required to be taken to more than 2.5 m below
the bed level. In heavy rainfall area and for stream with high velocity, protection of scourable bed on downstream
side should be ensured. This protection is usually in the form of a launching apron using large size stones.
7.7.23. Design aspects
:
The pipes shall be conform to IS:458-1989 (Specification for concrete pipes)
and shall be laid as per relevant 18:783-1985 (laying of concrete pipes). The structural design of pipe culvert
requires calculations of probable maximum load on the pipe, inherent strength ofpipe and selection ofbedding
for the pipe. The load factor of a pipe depends on different conditions of bedding as well as laying of pipes. It
is desirable to use type A, i.e., concrete cradle bedding for pipes of 1000 mm diameter and above and those with
fills higher than 4 m. The minimum compressive strength of concrete should be 20 MPa. The type B bedding is
adopted for height of fill between. 0.6 m and 4 m.
It consists of a continuous layer of compacted sand or
moorum, with minimum thickness of 75 mm below the pipe. The fill material shall be free from clay lumps
retained on 75 mm sieve and from stone retained on a 26.5 mm sieve. Fig. 7.1 shows different field conditions
in foundation.
It may be ensured that the minimum height of fill above pipe including road crust shall be
1000 mm. The relevant MoRT&H Specifications may be followed for laying and back filling of pipes.
7.7.2.4.
Jointing of pipe
: The pipes shall be joined either by collar joint or the flush joint. The collar
shall be ofRCC 150 mm to 200 mm wide having strength as that of pipes. Caulking space shall be between 13
to 20 mm according to the diameter of the pipe. The collar shall be properly placed over the joint of the pipe to
cover the joint evenly. Caulking material shall be a wet mix of cement and sand in the ratio of 1 :2 rammed with
caulking irons.
In case of flush joint the ends of pipes are specially shaped to form a self-centering joint with jointing
space 13 mm wide. The jointing space shall be filled with cement mortar (cement:sand
1 :2) mixed sufficiently
dry to remain in position when forced with a trowel or rammer. Care shall be taken to fill all voids and excess
mortar shall be removed.
7.7.3.
RCC slab culvert
7.7.3.1.
Catchment area and span requirement
: RCC slab culvert is one of the common types of
culvert. For catchment area more than 60 hectares, RCC slab culvert offer an economical and convenient
proposal. The approximate relationship between the catchment area and the span is given in Table 7.5.

7.7.3.2.
Minimum depth from lowest bed level
: Minimum depth from lowest bed level to soffit is
1.5 m. Normally a small
bridge will not be required for catchment area less than 125 hectares.
Most of the
culverts on roads can be adjusted according to catchment area indicated in Table 7.5.
7.7.3.3.
Detailing
: M25 concrete and High Strength Deformed bars are specified for usage in deck
slab. A nominal 1:1.5:3 concrete mix with 43 grade cement and a water cement ratio restricted to 0.45 can
produce this strength. In case of simply supported slabs,
it is a common practice to crank alternative bars at 1/
7
th clear span. Similar practice can be adopted for solid slab culvert of 4.0 m span and above. But in case of 3.0
m span and below, only one bar in every four bars is to be bent. Alternatively, cranking may be avoided. The
plates showing the type designs indicate the exact number of bars to be cranked.
The shear force at the support of a deck slab is large. In slab with small spans of 3.0 m or less, local bond
stress exceeds permissible limit when alternate bars are bent. Therefore alternate bars are not bent in such small
spans. The standard designs of RCC slab issued by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for spans of
3.0 m to 10 m are meant for a carriageway of 12 m width and designed for Class 70 R loading. These drawings
are not applicable to CD works on rural roads. The design live load adopted for the type design of solid slab on
rural road is two lanes of Class A with impact. Although bearings are required for 12-15 m spans, they may be
avoided with the stipulation that the substructures are appropriately designed by considering horizontal forces.
Plates 7.7 to 7.16 give details ofRCC deck slab for span
1 .5 to 15 m and an overall width of 6 m, 6.4 m and 7.5 m.
7.7.4.
RCC box type culvert
7.7.4.1.
Section of box culvert
: Box section of size less than 2 x 2 m is not practicable to implement.
Box type culverts are suitable for a situation where the catchment area is more than 30 hectares. An isolated
box culvert is economical in such cases where either the depth of foundation is more than 4 metres below bed
level or where the total embankment is very high, as in the case of approaches of a long bridge. Normal sections
ofbox culverts adopted for different catchment areas are given in Table 7.6. Box culverts of smaller sections or
arch culverts are cost effective at most of the locations particularly in strata with low bearing capacity and
where founding strata is deep seated.

The loads that are considered in the design of a box culvert are the live load and dead loads such as self
weight, load due to earth fill (if any) on the top slab, soil reaction on the bottom slab, and those due to lateral
earth pressure on the vertical walls. The hydrostatic pressures due to standing water are also considered in the
design. The moments per unit width of box are calculated by the moment distribution method, or any other
analytical method. Some design offices resort to the usage of design coefficients, which depend on length to
width ratio, and the thickness of the top, bottom and side slabs. Most design offices now use computer aided
analytical methods supported by various structural analysis software. The type designs of box cells given in
Plates 7.18 and 7.19 maybe referred to. Details of lesser cross Section, such as, lxl m,
1 .5 x
1 .5 m, etc. can be
used when ready-to-use charts are available.

7.7.5.
Arch culvert (masonry/precast block)
7.7.5.1.
Pre-cast concrete block arch
: These types of the culverts have been constructed on shallow
streams in the interior region of Maharashtra State.
If the river bed material comprise of sand or clay then the
cost of protection work increases. When the lead distance for transporting hume pipes from a factory is more,
the cost ofpipe culvert escalates. In such a situation, adoption of precast arch construction would be economical.
A semi-circular arch of 1 .4 m span with a rise of 0.7 m was first evolved. The span was further increased to 2.0
m with the rise of 1.0 m. The arches were constructed with precast concrete blocks. The foundation for the
erodible bed was RCC raft with diaphragm walls/pedestal to support the arch. The raft foundation is designed
as a beam on elastic foundation. Multiple arches can be constructed using precast block technology.
The concrete blocks could be 200 mm wide,
1 50 mm thick and circular arc length of 450 mm at crown.
An individual block weighs about 20 kg. The plain concrete blocks made of M15 grade are placed in a row of
semi-circular formwork and joints are staggered to ensure proper connectivity. The crown and the haunches are
filled with plain concrete. The pedestals of400 mm width and
1 50 mm thickness are cast to support the precast
arch rings. The cut-off walls are provided to prevent scouring of the bed material below the raft. A concrete
cushion of about 300 mm is provided above the arch of the crown and haunches to distribute the traffic load
transversely. In case of non-erodible stratum, the height of pedestal can be suitably increased to support the
arches. Open foundations are provided to the pedestals or piers, where suitable. The arches could be raised
over piers and the resulting structure would be a low level submersible bridge. A typical arch form is shown
in Fig. 7.2.
The precast concrete blocks have the following advantages:
(i)
For repetitive type of construction the moulds and formwork for the arch can be prefabricated as per the requirements.
(ii)
The concrete blocks of required quality can be cast near the site.
(iii)
Local mason, skilled workers can be trained to do the job.
7.7.5.2.
Brick masonry arches
: The art of construction of masonry arches is quite ancient and some
of the bridges built during mediaeval period are still in service.
Several shapes of masonry arch bridges are in
vogue, such as, elliptical, parabolic, segmental and semi-circular construction. Out of these, semi-circular and

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
segmental forms are more popular. The brick masonry shall conform to IS:40-1995. The load carrying capacity
of an arch bridge depends on span/rise ratio, span, and thickness of arch ring and depth of earth fill (cushion) at
the crown section. The other factors are known to be the strength of brick masonry and quality of construction.
The normal size of burnt clay bricks is 220x100x70 mm or 200x200x100 mm and
1 :4 cement mortar is used for
erection of the brick masonry. The arch ring can comprise of single, two, three or four layers ofbrick depending
on the requirement. The 100 mm face of brick is obviously to be placed in the radial direction of arch.
The required thickness of earth fill over crown shall be 300 mm or above for all spans. The thickness of
semi-circular brick masonry arch ring and, the depth of fill required in relation to axle load capacity is given in
Table 7.7. The axle load capacity is arrived at using the Pippard's formulae for masonry arches.

The depth of foundation depends on local scour conditions, and therefore, the abutments/abutment piers
are to be protected from bed erosion and scour at both entry and exit end. The earth fill is contained in spandrel
walls, and parapet walls are provided for safety reason. A premix carpet wearing coat or a concrete slab could
be provided for carriageway.
In view of the availability of fly ash in abundance, the usage of fly ash bricks is being encouraged. The
fly ash bricks could also be used in place of burnt clay bricks in arch culvert. Plate 7.17 gives designs for spans
6 m
, 9 m and 12 m of masonry
- either bricks, stone or concrete block.
7.7.53.
RCC arch culvert
: The arches can be cast in-situ also. The above types of arches with 2.0 m
span and
1.0m rise can be constructed on site. The semi-circular prefabricated formwork can be used for the
construction of an arch culvert or causeway. Typical drawings for RCC arch causeways are given in Plates
7.26.1, 7.26.2, 7.26.3. The details of reinforcement for arches and raft foundation are also given therein. The
raft foundation is used in the strata with Safe Bearing Capacity (SBC) less than 10 t/m
2
. For non-erodible hard
strata, the arches can be rested on the pedestal directly. The pedestal will have to be suitably anchored in the
hard strata.

Trautwme suggested that Fs should be taken as 10 to account for unknowns in geological formation of
stones used. The value could be taken as 3 for igneous and metamorphic rocks. Cut stones of 300 mm width

It is to note that the
IRC:6 does not specify impact factors for masonry bridges.
7.7.7.
Stone masonry scupper
: This type ofCD work is more common in the Himalayan regions of
Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal.
In hill roads, it is conventional to cut the roads from
the hill face in one working season and open the road immediately to light traffic. The construction ofpavements
and roadside drains are taken up subsequently.
Stone being the locally available material, stone corbelled
scuppers are provided as semi-permanent CD works, to carry the water from side drains collected from hill
slopes. A typical dry stone masonry scupper of 1 m span is shown in Plate 7.27. The foundations of abutments
shall be kept horizontal.
The length of scupper may be increased or decreased as per requirement at site.
If
good stone is not locally available or withm 10 km distance, the scupper may be replaced by RCC slab or box
culvert with catchwater drains.
Since the ventway is small, a scupper can carry only limited discharge. Therefore,
they are provided at frequent intervals, like, 4 to 6 numbers per km length depending on the requirement.
It is
found that stone corbelled scupper is more stable than stone masonry arch, under seismic conditions. Therefore,
these are
preferable in Himalayan region.
Further, construction of a scupper does not need any extra skill.
However, dry stone masonry scuppers need periodic examination, since the stones are likely to be dislodged in
the event of a high discharge after a cloud burst.
Plate 7.27 gives details of stone masonry scupper.
7.7.8.
Design aspects and specifications
7.7.8.1.
Design considerations
: The type designs of pipe culvert and RCC slab culvert are based on
some of the following considerations. The CR/RR stone or brick masonry for substructure and parapet walls
are found to be economical in comparison to mass concrete sub- structure. The masonry below ground level
should be in cement mortar 1:4 and above ground level in cement mortar
1:5.
If burnt clay bricks with a
crushing strength of 7 MPa are available, they can also be used for culverts.
Fly ash bricks can also be used
instead of burnt clay bricks when the strength is more than 7 MPa. Where bricks of specified strength are not
available, CR/RR stone masonry could be attempted.

7.7.8.2.
Foundation concrete
(i)
Foundation concrete for masonry abutment and return shall be M10, otherwise it shall be M15.
If the foundation level is
below water table, 10 per cent extra cement should be added in concrete.
(ii)
The thickness of PCC footing below abutment should be minimum 200 mm.
In case of pipe culvert,
it is not necessary to
provide concrete bedding below the entire length and width of pipe.
(lii) A moorum cushion consolidated to 200 mm thickness is adequate. However, 200 mm thick cushion below pipe and 300
mm wide Ml 5 concrete bedding is necessary at all thejoints of pipes. The guidelines given in IS:783- 1 985 should be followed;
20 mm size aggregate should be used for foundation concrete and 40 mm size aggregate for abutment and return walls.
7.7.8.3.
Return wall or wing wall
: Length of return and splayed wing wall are generally found to be
better than straight returns. However, straight returns are easy for construction and standardisation. The layout
and construction of wing wall is also difficult.
It is, therefore, proposed to provide straight return walls for
culverts. The length of return walls beyond the faces of abutments should be as given in Table 7.8.

3.75 to 4.5

The Sections of return wall are given in Plates 7.2, 7.3, and 7.5. Normally the length of return should be
1 .5 times the height of abutment above lowest bed level. For the purpose of standardisation common lengths of
returns are proposed. A toe wall may be provided at the end of earth slopes at abutments for protection of
slopes.
If the height of road top from the bed level at abutment is more than 4 m, the length of returns should
be suitably worked out. Foundation level of returns may be stepped up to reduce the cost, if suitable founding
strata are available at shallow depth. But at such change of foundation level, continuity between two parts may
be broken by a vertical joint.
7.7.8.4.
Section of abutment, pier and return
(a) Section of abutment and returns
: Following sections are given in plates:

Plate 7.5
The abutment cap and cap on return wall and dirt wall for culverts will be of plain concrete ofM20 grade with surface reinforcement.
Where bearings are provided the cap will be reinforced. For dirt wall of spans more than 6 m the dirt wall shall be reinforced.
Stepped piers and abutments are chosen for ease of shuttering since tapered sections are likely to pose construction problems in
rural areas. Plates 7.2 and 7.3 give cross sectional details of masonry abutments and returns for spans
1 .5 to
3.0 m and 4.0 to
6.0 m respectively. Quantity of abutment and returns in both masonry and PCC are indicated in Plate 7.24 for guidance.
(b)
Piers
: The sections ofPCC pier and the method of designing a pier are given in the Plates 7.4 and 7.6. The sections of PCC
return walls and wing walls are given in Plate 7.5. Where bearing capacity of soil
is low, the lateral dimensions of the footing
could be increased suitably. Type sections for RCC pier and abutment caps besides dirt walls are given Plate 7.25.
(c)
Miscellaneous
:
Stopper, protection around abutment and treatment for the submersible bridge is given in the Plate 7.20.

IRC:SP:20-2002
7.7.8.5.
Approach slab
: Abutment is designed for surcharge of equivalent height 1.2 m and return
walls for an equivalent height of 0.6 m. Therefore, there is no need to provide approach slab. However, it may
be desirable to provide a pavement for entire formation width for length of 3.6 m behind abutment, between
returns.
7.7.8.6.
Design of masonry section
: The following considerations are taken into account:
(a)
Abutments are designed for a live load surcharge of
1 .2 m, (Clause 714.4 of IRC:78).
(b)
Granular material filling is provided between return walls. (Appendix 6 of IRC:78 should be followed).
7.7.8.7.
Expansion joints/bearing surface
(i)
For span up to 3 m
: Expansion gap may not be provided up to 3 m span. The top of abutment cap and the face of dirt wall
(on slab side) are however coated with a layer of bitumen.
(ii)
For span between 3 to 6 m
: For spans between 3 m to 6 m a pre-moulded bituminous sheet such as Shalitex board of
1
mm thickness may be provided.
In the parapet wall
it
is desirable to provide a vertical joint in the masonry wall at the
location of end of deck slab. Thus the parapet wall shall have three parts, viz.
, the central part over deck portion and two
side parts over return walls.
Corresponding joint is also necessary in the coping over parapet wall.
(iii)
Tar paper (bearing) should be provided on all supports of deck slab upto 10 m spans.
7.7.8.8.
Weep hole and water spout
: Weep holes are provided to prevent building up of hydrostatic
pressure behind abutments and wing walls.
(i)
There may not be any need for weep holes and waterspouts in small span culverts.
However, local practices prevails on
size and spacing of weep holes, which may be followed.
(ii)
If the height of abutment and return over bed level
is more than 2 m, weep holes should be provided 150 mm above low
water level (LWL) or ground level (GL) whichever
is higher.
In case of stone masonry, weep holes of 150 mm dia or
80x150 mm size in
1 :20 slope should be provided at required intervals (Refer: IRC:40).
(iii) For 5 m and 6 m span one waterspout of 100 mm dia should be provided in the centre of slab on either side of the deck.
7.7.8.9.
Grade of concrete
: In the past, M10 and Ml 5 grades of cement concrete were extensively
used in CD works. As per IRC:21, the minimum grade of structural concrete is M20 (design mix). Where the
quantum of concrete work is small as in CD works of rural roads, it is suggested to use nominal mix based on
volumetric proportion of cement, sand and aggregate with a low water cement ratio up to 0.45. The minimum
quantity of cement shall be 310 kg/m
3
. Superplasticizers could be used to improve workability.
7.7.8.10.
Pre-cast construction for culvert
: This type of construction has certain advantages.
Construction time could be reduced considerably, if precast concrete blocks or other RCC units are adopted for
abutments, in place ofCR/RR stone masonry. Due to non-availability of good masons, present trend is to adopt
cast-in-situ PCC M 1 5
. These works are likely to be handled by small inexperienced contractors, and in remote
areas the quality of concrete is likely to be poor.
It would, therefore, be desirable if factories manufacturing pre
cast concrete block of Ml 5 strength are set up to produce blocks of 200x200x400 mm and 200x100x400 mm
sizes. Such units can be easily handled manually.
Pre cast blocks of 0.6 m width for spans upto 2 m weighing about 600 kg can also be easily handled
manually; and can be considered for adoption in suitable cases. Such blocks shall conform to IS:2 1 85 (Part
1 )-
1979 concrete masonry units.
7.7.8.11.
Cost of culvert
: From the data available from various States, the cost of culverts constructed
recently follow the break-up of cost given in Table 7.9. The height of culverts were between 2.4 to 3.2 m and
spans 1.5 to 2.5 m.

(a)
Height (H) from top of foundation to the top of slab
(b)
Overall width (W) and the length of returns
But the cost of items (iv) and (v) consisting 25 per cent of overall cost is governed by:
•
Span of culvert (L)
•
Width of culvert (W)
In case of culvert, the span is not a function of height. Hence, cost of culvert cannot be calculated on the
basis of span.
7.7.8.12.
Minor bridges on rural roads
: For rural roads only such minor bridges are normally taken
up where the height from the low bed level (LBL) to road top is within 8.0 m and where span is within
1 5 m. For
such bridges, the same sections of abutment and returns provided for culverts may be adopted. Type designs
for these spans are available.
If heights of the small bridge from bed level
is more than 8.0 m design of
abutments and piers is called for. Similarly, abutments/piers of 1 2- 1 5 m span bridges are to be designed separately,
if bearings are not provided. If the bearing capacity of soil is poor the footing need to be suitably widened. The
Plates given in this Chapter consider a safe bearing capacity of 30 T/m
2 which could be suitably modified for
lower values of SBC, wherever required.
7.8.
Causeway and Submersible Bridge
A causeway may not be a small bridge (length less than 30 m) but is a low cost cross drainage work of
longer length. These are so built that the period of interruption to traffic during rainy season is short. The outer
width of causeway should be equal to roadway width. A submersible bridge is a bridge, which gets submerged
during monsoon in high floods of short duration, but is available for use of traffic during the rest of the times.
7.8.1.
Criteria for submersible bridge
: All culverts and small bridges (upto 30 m length) may be
of high-level type. However, high-level minor and major bridges, are not considered on rural roads due to their
high cost. They may also not be necessary for traffic requirements. Therefore, causeways or submersible bridges
instead of major bridges could be provided on rural roads after comparing relative costs.
The period of permissible interruptions to the traffic due to submergence of a bridge could be 6 times in
a year the period not exceeding 24 hours if no alternative access road is available. For this,
it is necessary to
correctly ascertain the Ordinary Flood Level (OFL). The OFL when cleared under the bridge provides permissible
interruption to traffic. Such OFL and Reduced Level (RL) is to be arrived at considering the frequency of flood
above that RL so that submergence consequent to higher floods do not exceed permissible frequency of
interruption to traffic. If there is a considerable difference in OFL and HFL then it will be adequate to provide
140



======================================================================
PAGE 169 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
bridge clearing the OFL and submersible for HFL. The soffit level of the bridge should be fixed so as to clear
the OFL with some free board.
From streams with a velocity of flow more than 6 m/sec, causeways and submersible bridges may be
avoided. If the cost of a submersible bridge with its approaches is more than about 70 per cent of the cost of a
high level bridge with approaches at the same site,
it is advisable to adopt a high level bridge. The decision of
construction of a high level bridge should be taken after careful consideration ofbridge site and related parameters.
In case of causeway and submersible bridge, the RCC kerb of 250 mm width should not be continuous. After
1.5 m continuous length of kerb there should be a gap of 300 mm so that flood water is discharged expediously
from the top of riding surface. The size of kerb stone used could be 500x250x300 mm.
7.8.2.
Special aspects of submersible bridges and causeways
: Since submersible bridges and
causeways have been constructed extensively in several States in the past, guidelines and practices may be
available in the
States.
Extract of guidelines adopted in Maharashtra PWD are enclosed for reference,
Appendices-7.1 and 7.2. These may vary from region to region. Therefore, local guidelines and practices with
due modifications may be adopted.
The sections ofpiers given in the Plate 7.06 can be adopted for submersible bridges as well. The approaches
of causeways and submersible bridges should be preferably without banking.
It has also to be ensured that
height of submersible embankment shall not be excessive and hence, correct ascertaining ofOFL, is important.
The road level for a submersible bridge should never be below OFL unless only causeway is intended to be
provided. While fixing the level of submersible bridge, consideration is also required to be given to OFL, vis-
a-vis, terrace level on riverbanks, which occasionally get over topped. Where adequate flood frequency and
gauging records are not available, thorough local inquiries are to be made to fix the OFL.
If the mean velocity of flow is more than 4.0 m/sec deck of submersible bridge must be suitably anchored.
The stopper needs to be provided in cap of all submersible bridges. Part of the approach of a submersible
bridge, which goes in submergence, needs protection. Protection could be done with precast cement concrete
(interlocked) blocks or stone blocks. The required protection at submersible bridge has been shown in Plates
7.20 and 7.21. Provision of return walls on both sides and a pacca drain as shown in the Plates can serve the
purpose. For submersible bridges discontinuous kerbs and removal/collapsible railings may be provided.
Alternatively pipe railings can also be provided.
Plates 7.20, 7.22, 7.23, 7.26. 1
, 7.26.2, 7.26.3 and 7.26.4 give
details of causeways/submersible bridges.
7.8.3.
Inspection and maintenance of small bridge and culvert
: Although there
is no special
publication on maintenance of culverts, nevertheless, the IRC:SP:35 may be followed for inspection and use
may be made of the inspection proformae given in Appendices-4 and 5 of the publication.
It is pertinent that
an inventory of CD works be prepared both for existing as well as new CD works on rural roads.
Since the
waterway is usually small they tend to get clogged due to accumulation of silt and debris.
In addition, the
growth of vegetation should be checked lest the
life of CD works would be curtailed.
Small bridges and
culverts will not last the expected life unless inspected and repaired frequently-normally twice in a year.
Timely and proper maintenance of culverts is very important for their upkeep. The maintenance covers
three aspects:
(i)
Maintenance of Channel
(ii)
Maintenance of Structure
(iii)
Maintenance of Approaches
141



======================================================================
PAGE 170 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
The inlet of channel should preferably be on a straight alignment so that accumulation of debris or
occurrence of eddy currents is minimal. The bed of the stream should be suitably protected to prevent erosion
or scour.
It is expedient to carry out repairs to the substructure to prevent their early deterioration. The headwalls
and wing walls should be inspected for cracks, settlement and unusual backpressures and rectification undertaken
where required. The timely maintenance of wearing coat prevents occurrence of potholes in the earth cushion
or the damage to RCC slab or the structure.
The sinking of approaches is quite common in rural areas. This is primarily due to movement of cattle
from approach roads to the stream and also improper compaction of the earth fill. Occurrence of potholes due
to undermining is also common. All the above things are to be attended to make the movement of traffic safe.
Maintenance of culverts and causeways is elaborated in Appendix-11.4 of Chapter on Maintenance.
7.9.
Quality Control
7.9.1.
General aspects
: Although the work of culvert is simple, it is necessary to have proper quality
control in the work of stone masonry and concrete in deck slab, bar-bending, etc. The specifications for culvert
should be in accordance to "Specifications for Road and Bridge Works" of Ministry of Road Transport and
Highways. The testing of various construction materials and other tests during construction should be carried
out as per the Ministry's specifications. Quality Control aspects for concrete have been covered in Chapter 10
in this Manual.
Formwork and False work: The considerations offormwork and false work aspects in bridges and culverts
should be as per IRC:87 Guidelines for the Design and Erection of Falsework for Road Bridges.
7.9.2.
Stone masonry
(i)
For the work of culvert course rubble (second sort) masonry
is stipulated.
(ii)
Face stones shall be hammer dressed on all beds and joints so as to give them approximately rectangular shape. The bed
joint shall be chisel drafted for at least 80 mm backs from the face and at least 40 mm for the side joints. No portion of the
dressed surface shall show a depth or gap more than
1 0 mm from a straight edge placed on
it.
(iii)
The hearting or interior filling of the wall shall consist of flat-bedded stone carefully laid on their proper beds in mortar.
The use of chips shall be restricted to the filling of interstices between the adjacent stones in hearting and these shall not
exceed
1 5 per cent of the quantity of masonry.
(iv)
Bond stones or headers shall be at
1 .5 m or
1 .8 m apart clear in every course. The headers shall overlap at least
1 50 mm.
(v)
Face stone shall tail into the work for not less than their heights and at least one third of the stones shall tail into the work
for a length not less than twice their height.
(vi)
The face joint shall not be more than 20 mm thick.
(vii) The height of course shall depend on locally available size of stone.
In no case the height of course should be less than
1 50
mm. The heights of courses generally adopted are
1 60 mm,
1 80 mm and 200 mm.
(viii) The size of face stones for these heights of courses are given in Table 7.10.

(ix)
Size C can be adopted for precast concrete blocks of
1 :3:6 (cement:sand:coarse aggregate). Although there is no restriction
for adopting the other courses (A and B),
it is desirable to adopt 200 mm courses and insist on getting large size stones
from quarries.
(x)
Sizes of stones as specified above are not cut by labour and generally random sizes are made. With some efforts
it should
be possible to obtain the size of stones as specified above. On measuring the sizes of stones, the height of course should be
fixed by the Engineer-in-Charge and insisted upon in the construction. The length of header should not be less than 400 mm.
(xi)
The back batter of abutment
is one horizontal to three verticals.
The offset should be
l/3
rd height, of course, if stepped
masonry is provided in place of batter. The front batter below ground level is one horizontal to two verticals, the offset
will therefore be Vi the height of course.
(xii) The laying of stone masonry: On fixing the face stones in position, the stones in the hearting should be placed and fixed in
mortar and all interstices and stone chips laid in mortar should fill in gaps. In this way each stone in hearting shall be fixed
properly in the course. The method of laying hearting between the face stones and pouring mortar and water is not a sound
practice and should not be followed. The vertical pin headers shall be provided in each course for attaining bond between
the two courses. Generally Grade 33 or blended cement should preferably be used for masonry works.
43 Grade cement
causes shrinkage and may be avoided in stone masonry works.
7.9.3.
Concrete
:
According to IRC: 21, Ml 5 is the minimum grade of plain concrete and M25 is the stipulated strength for
RCC. The nominal mix adapted in small works and their corresponding strength for different works using 43
grade cement is given in Table 7.1 1 for guidance.

Note: Mix proportions are by weight
Ml 5 could also be used as foundation concrete below abutments and piers where SBC is low.
The sizes of reinforcement to be used for RCC slabs and the grading of aggregates are specified in the
schedule of rates issued by different States.
It is advisable to use power driven concrete mixer to produce
concrete for all culverts.
Similarly, needle and form vibrators should be used for compaction of concrete.
Bottom cover of concrete must be ensured by providing precast briquettes of concrete.
However, concrete
must be suitably vibrated. Water cement ratio must be limited to 0.45 (maximum). With the use of plasticisers,
the w/c ratio can be brought down to 0.4. Measurement of volume mix concrete in rural areas is generally done
by locally made containers arid there is no uniformity in size.
It is advisable to key 6 steel boxes each with a
volume of halfbag, the size being 300x300x195 mm with 2 handles. This can be easily lifted by a male labour.
With the usage of these boxes quality of concrete improves. Wherever possible, mix design can be prepared by
weigh batching and converted to volume batching by using boxes of appropriate size.
7.9.4.
Reinforcement details
: Lengths of bars, bending profile and numbers are given in the Plates
listed in Section 7.11. Cutting of bars from available stock must be done carefully. Generally the tendency is to
cut bars ofrequired lengths and discard pieces of shorter lengths leading to greater wastage. There is no restriction
m providing staggered overlaps
1 in every 5 bars (4 bars of full length and one overlapped or welded bar). The
calculated quantities of steel are increased by 4 per cent to account for overlaps. However, cranking of
reinforcements may be avoided, for spans less than 4 m. In case of welding, the relevant Clauses in IRC:21 may
143



======================================================================
PAGE 172 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
be adhered to. Steel riders should be provided at cranked bars for maintaining them in correct position and
alignment during concreting.
7.9.5.
Precast works
: As already mentioned, if factories manufacturing concrete blocks of Ml
strength and about 0.6 to
1 m wide precast RCC slab (upto 2 m span) are located near by quality products would
be available and work can be expedited. For spans larger than 2 m, cast m-situ concreting is resorted to.
7.9.6.
Fly ash bricks
: These bricks are now manufactured extensively and the minimum strength
required is 7 MPa. Such bricks can be used for culverts. The brick masonry work would be faster. On account
ofrestriction in making deep pits in ground for brick, fly ash bricks of strengths more than 7 MPa are manufactured
extensively near towns. It would be possible to identify requirements of total quantity of bricks for culverts and
establish factories of fly ash bricks in several districts at suitable places and transport them to the sites of
culverts.
7.9.7.
Setting out of culverts
: Setting out of culverts should be done from four masonry pillars, two
in the direction of road and two along the drain, all placed along two centre lines.
The top of pillars in the
direction of road should be at the proposed top level of deck slab. Two lines, one across the road top level of
deck slab, two lines, one across the road (zero line) and one along the centre line of road should be inscribed on
one of the pillars and all distances along and across be measured from these lines. The pillars should be placed
sufficiently away from the zone of excavation.
7.9.8.
Protection works
: For better performance, protection work at abutment is necessary. Details
are given in Plates 7.20 and 7.21.

Recommendations
(i)
For catchment areas upto 20 hectares pipe culverts will be economical in comparison to slab culverts on
all types of roads.
This criteria will be suitable if the pipe manufacturing factory is situated within a
distance of 300 km from the site of work. Availability of pipes should be assessed before specifying pipe
culverts; otherwise the work of culverts is likely to be delayed.
(ii)
For catchment areas more than 50 hectares, RCC slab culverts offer economical solution. Alternatively
*box culverts, single or multiple cells can be used.
The cost of other CD works are to be worked out
separately.
(iii)
All the culverts and small bridges upto 15 m span must be of high-level type.
Minor bridges could be
either high level or submersible type. Submersible bridges are adopted if the cost of bridge and approach
is less than 70 per cent of the cost of high-level bridge with approaches.
Protection works of approaches
are necessary for causeways and submersible bridges and the details for the same are given in Plates.
Precast units can also be used for arch form of construction.
(iv)
Quality control in the work: Construction of a culvert can be expedited ifprecast concrete blocks are used
instead of masonry for abutments and precast RCC slabs can be adopted for culverts upto 4 m length in
rural areas.
Fly ash bricks or other bricks having strength more than 7 MPa can also be adopted in the
construction of arch culverts and abutments of slab culverts of low heights.
(v)
Power driven mixers and vibrators must be used for concrete works and the water cement ratio be restricted
to 0.45.
It is advisable to use plasticisers and reduce w/c ratio to 0.4 to achieve higher strength of concrete.
(vi)
With a view to expedite preparation of estimates, quantities of abutment return and deck slab are given
separately.
In Plate 7.24 the quantities for an overall width of 7.5 m, 6.4 m and 6.0 m have been given.
(vii)
This Manual contains guidelines for raised causeways, anchorages of submersible bridges and details of
protection work as well. Width of 7.5 m, 6.4 m and 6.0 m have been given.
(viii)
This Manual contains guidelines for raised causeways, anchorages of submersible bridges and details of
protection work as well.

Guidelines for Construction of Causeway
7.1.1.
Introduction
A road network is never complete till all CD works including minor bridges and major bridges on the
same are completed. Due to several constraints on the allocated funds for roads, many a time the CD works and
bridges on the road network are taken up later on. However, till these bridges and CD works are completed to
make the crossings fordable during monsoon and floods, the causeways or such type of lower level passages
have to be constructed at least to make them usable during the post monsoon period. The causeways or paved
dips (hard passages) are no substitute for high-level bridges or submersible bridges with permissible interruptions
to traffic. Such causeways are essentially low cost solutions designed for floods of frequency much higher than
those for submersible bridges. Apart from floods, the causeways are not designed for all such forces, which are
considered for design ofbridges. Therefore some damages during floods do occur on such causeways. However,
if proper precautions are taken in planning and designing of the causeways, some of the damages though
cannot be- avoided altogether, could at least be minimized. Some of guidelines would enable the field officers
in planning, designing and construction of causeways to avert or minimize major avoidable damages.
7.1.2.
Definition
Causeway
: A causeway is a small submersible structure with or without openings, which allows flood
to pass over it. Depending on the type of construction and the road level above the bed of the watercourse, these
structures can be classified under, flush, low level and high-level causeways.
Flush causeway
: It is a paved dip or road dam of a roadway, built to cross a shallow watercourse. The
top level of road dam shall be at the same level as that of the bed of the watercourse.
A low level or a vented causeway
: This
is a structure provided with a few openings comprising of
pipes, short span slabs or small arches etc. with a raised road top level to a moderate height upto 1.20 m.
In
exceptional cases it may be 1.50 m high.
A high level causeway
:
This is a submersible structure provided with larger openings comprising of a
simply supported/continuous RCC slab or multiple arches or boxes and a raised road top level to a reasonable
height upto
1 .50 to 3.00 m. The RCC slab may be supported over a series of short masonry piers.
7.1.3.
Causes leading to damage
: A study of the damages to causeways and their malfunctioning
reveal some of the following characteristics:
(i)
Outflanking of the causeways.
(ii)
Collapse of downstream head wall.
(iii)
Damages to road pavement on the causeways.
The probable causes of the above damages could be
:
(i)
Inadequate or blocked openings;
(ii)
Scour on the downstream side;
(iii)
Inadequate keying of the headwall in the natural banks.
(iv)
Silting on the upstream side and High velocity of steam and inadequate pavement protection.
7.1.4.
Precautions to be taken
: It is generally observed that the Road Top Level (RTL) selected is
abnormally high compared to the vent way provided. This condition causes heading up of water on upstream
145

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
side and results in producing high velocities, which lead to structural failure and also out flanking. The road top
level of the causeway should be kept as low as possible and be restricted to the heights mentioned in paras 7.2.
1
to 7.2.3 of Appendix-7.2.
Area of the Vents
: The water way provided in the causeway should not be less than 30 per cent of the
area of the stream, measured between the stream bed level and the proposed top level of road. However, larger
vent area is desirable in case where the causeway is located on the existing natural crossings. These areas
should be calculated at the defined cross-section of the stream. In scanty rainfall areas, i.e., annual rainfall less
than 750 mm, the vent area can be brought down to 15 per cent.
The upstream and downstream face walls of the causeway should cover the whole bed width of the
watercourse in case of vented and high level causeways. A rising face wall should be provided upto the top
level of the protected bed.
This face wall serves two major purposes, viz
:
(i)
It converges the flow and avoids out-flanking.
(ii) It protects the pavement and makes the shape hydraulically efficient.
Foundations of the headwalls should be taken sufficiently deep to avoid exposure due to scouring. Extra
care should be taken about the depth of foundation of the downstream head wall in erosive strata, like, soil, soft
moorum and sand.
In erosive strata, downstream protection by way of apron, should invariably be provided.
It is observed that in causeways with pipe openings, the general tendency is to provide 600 mm thick
earth cushion above the pipes. Even though this cushioning is essential for the load distribution and safety of
the pipes in general, this provision increases the Road Top Level (RTL) undesirably high and makes the
submersible structure hydraulically inefficient. This cushioning should be reduced to the barest minimum by
providing Cement Concrete Pavement, Stone Set Pavement or Penetration Macadam,
etc. above the pipe
openings.
As the causeways are expected to allow the flood water to pass over them and the traffic requirements
demand immediate use, the road surface on the causeway should be such that it does not get damaged due to
frequent over topping.
Sufficiently stable pavement should, therefore, be provided for the full width of the
causeway.
It should also cover the protected bed portion of the causeway. In case of large submergence, where
submersible approaches are provided, similar suitable precautions should be taken while providing the pavement
including downstream protection.
It is observed in many washed out and a pavement damaged causeways that the filling between the head
walls is done with clayey material. As it is very difficult to ensure proper consolidation around pipes, the use of
clayey material should be avoided in causeway construction.
Filling between the headwalls should be done
with granular material like, sand, hard moorum, pebbles; gravel, small boulders, etc. As the river/steam bed
generally consists of such materials, best use of the same should be made of. If required, such material should
be brought from outside but in no case clayey material is used.
To increase hydraulic efficiency and structural stability, the following may be considered:
(i)
It is preferable that the downstream headwall should have batter on the outside, i.e., on downstream side
(ii)
It is also preferable to provide rounding at the outer corners to both the headwalls
(iii)
It is preferable to provide slight camber to pavement on one side only,
i.e., slopping to downstream side only
(iv) Road top level and top of coping above headwalls should be the same.
In case of streams carrying heavy
silt and floating debris,
it is desirable to provide a catch pit at the
upstream side opening to the vents. In case of streams carrying large floating debris, it is desirable to provide
146



======================================================================
PAGE 175 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
large openings comprising of slabs or arches rather than small openings of pipes. In case streams carrying large
floating material such as small bushes, trees and debris, arresters should be fixed on upstream side.
The work of causeway proper, its approaches, paving and the protective works like apron, paved drains
in approaches, pitching for the approaches, etc. should be so planned and undertaken, that all the works are
completed before onset of monsoon or else the function of the causeway structure gets impaired and the work
may be damaged.
7.1.5.
Design aspects
: For designing causeway by Engineers in the field, a simple step-by-step
procedure is described in Appendix-7.2.
It should be noted that while adopting the option of causeway and
effecting economy, basis principles of sound engineering practice and minimum technical requirements are not
overlooked.
These aspects should be kept in mind and to ensure strict adherence to the guidelines. Specific attention
should be paid to the following:
(i)
Road top levels above bed should be as low as possible as per guidelines for different types of openings.
(ii)
Vent opening below road top level.
Lower limit of 30 per cent of the area below RTL.
And lower limit of
1 5 per cent for scanty rainfall area.
However, higher vent area is desirable.
(iii)
Headwall shape in elevation-trapezoidal, blending smoothly with the natural cross-section of the watercourse with desir-
able grade
1
in 30.
(iv)
Provision of apron for downstream protection in erosive strata.

Appendix-7.2
Guidelines for Design of Causeways
(Issued by Govt, of Maharashtra)
7.2.1.
General principles
: A causeway
is a structure midway between a full-fledged bridge
(permitting full opening to flood waters) and a natural crossing obstructing no water way at all. A full-fledged
bridge provides uninterrupted passage for traffic throughout the year while a natural crossing provides passage
only during the dry season of the year.
A Causeway provides passage to the traffic in a major part of the year except during the flood season. An
engineer has to understand its shortcomings and take appropriate counter measures to make best utility out of
it and effect maximum economy while designing
it.
It is expected that a causeway remains undamaged during maximum flood and remains functional during
the rest of the time.
There is inter-relationship among road top level (RTL), opening provides below RTL
(Vent way) and length of the protected bed (Horizontal length of face wall and rising portion of the face wall on
both banks). For evolving most economical, stable and hydraulically efficient designs, different trials with the
above three parameters (i.e., RTL, Vent way and extent of protected bed) have to be undertaken. For successful
prevention of out-flanking,
it is necessary to carry out proper calculation of the number of vents and length of
rising face walls.
It
is very important to note that in a vented causeway, the rising face wall plays a very
important role in prevention of out flanking. For any natural watercourse, the most efficient hydraulic section
is hyperbolic open channel. Nature invariably adapts the same sections.
In road geometry, it is difficult to use
this section in its true shape. So a modified shape in the form of trapezoid is best adapted amongst all other
practicable shapes. This shape is achieved by rising face walls on the flanks and keeping the central porton of
the face wall at one level. The entire zone between these face walls should be paved and is generally referred as
protected bed.
7.2.2.
Component parts
: Simply raising the road top level of the causeway never ensures facility to
cross at higher floods unless adequate openings are provided. Otherwise it amounts to construction of a road
dam raised above the streambed which fails invariably. If due to cost consideration, it is not possible to provide
full openings for the floodwaters, the only alternative left is to reduce the height of causeway to the barest
minimum. In all flow conditions and the floodwater upto RTL is the most critical condition especially for the
submersible bridges. If the construction
is low, the flow becomes smooth, and the velocity remains under
control, thereby the damages are less. In all the types of causeways, the RTL should, therefore, be kept as low
as practicable.
Following recommendations are made:
Types of Causeway
Preferable Height
(i)
Paved dips or road dam
Same as stream bed level
(ii)
Low level or vented causeway
Maximum height should be
1 .2 m above bed in exceptional case
1 .5 m
(iii)
High level causeway
Maximum height should be 3 m above the bed.
Openings or vent area
: Vent area or openings provided below the RTL plays a great role in operational
efficiency and the hydraulic efficiency of the structure. It is desirable to provide vent area of at least 30 per cent
of the area obstructed at RTL. Higher values of vent area will reduce the expenditure on the raised face walls
and protected bed. In scanty rainfall areas, i.e., annual rainfall less than 750 mm, the vent area could be brought
down to 15 per cent.
148



======================================================================
PAGE 177 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
In case where the causeway
is located at the existing natural crossing, the obstructed area should be
calculated on the suitable defined cross-section of the steam immediately near the crossing by transferring the
road top level on that section.
Openings may be provided by Hume pipes. RCC slabs, Arches or RCC box cells. In erosive strata these
openings should be equally spaced through out the channel portion. The spacing could be designed in central
zone of causeway. In case of rocks and other non-erosive strata, the spacing may be suitably changed and
openings may preferably be provided in the lowest portion.
In case of openings with pipes
it is desirable to keep down stream sill of the pipes 300 mm below the
average bed level and to lay them to the shape of the stream. In order to keep down the RTL and increase the
percentage value of opening, the height of cushion above the pipes should be as low as possible. To enable such
reduction from structural point of view, it is desirable to provide cement concrete ofMl 5 grade or stone paving
on the top of pipes. In low rainfall areas where frequency of floods is less, a cushion with WBM and Penetration
Macadam also serves the purpose. With these specifications the height of cushioning above pipes can be
reduced to 225 mm.
Face walls and protected bed
: Major portion, of the floodwater has to be allowed to pass over the
headwalls of the causeways. The structure should, therefore, be strong enough to avoid damages during the
floods.
In order to keep velocities at the downstream, in desirable limits and avoid outflanking, cross-section
of flow should be adaptable to nature as explained earlier. This is achieved by providing raised face walls to a
certain level and protecting the paving upto that level.
It is desirable to keep the obstruction below 30 per cent to ensure sound behaviour of the hydraulic
structure. Taking the clue from the same, if the headwalls are raised and anchored into the bank upto a certain
level, it will provide additional area over the road top and limit the gross obstruction to flow at 30 per cent. This
would result into a stable structure and will not lead to outflank.
It is desirable to provide length of the level portion equal to the width of the stream at RTL at defined
cross-section plus 2 to 5 m on either side. The length of rising face walls will be governed by the difference
between Protected Bed Level (PBL) and RTL and the gradient for the protected bed.
This gradient should
preferably be
1 in 30 in a flat terrain or shallow stream and may be steeper in hilly terrain and/or deep gorge but
should be limited to
1 in 15.
"For the structural stability and better hydraulic performance", it is desirable that batter should be provided
on the outside faces of the headwalls. At least downstream face wall should have batter on downstream side.
Road level corners of the headwalls should be provided with suitable rounding. The face walls may be constructed
in cement concrete (M15) or random rubble masonry or some suitable material. Care should be taken to keep
the top of coping exactly at the same level as that of the road top.
Foundation of the level face wall and
1 to 2 m portion of the raised face wall should be taken sufficiently
deep to avoid exposure due to scouring.
Extra care should be taken of the downstream face wall in erosive
>
strata.
(a)
When the height of causeway is less than
] .2 m above the bed level, the depth of foundations may be within
1 .5 m in soils
other than purely sandy soils. For sandy soils this may be taken as
1 .8 m.
(b)
When the height is upto 3m, the depth of foundations may be taken upto 2.5 m.
in normal soils.
149



======================================================================
PAGE 178 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(c)
The general depth of foundations in different strata may be as follows:
Hard Rock
300 to 450 mm
Soft Rock
600 to 900 mm
Hard Moorum
1.20 m
Soft Moorum
1.50 m
Expansive Soils, like, Black
1 .50 to 2.50 m with
Cotton Soil
Usual precautions
(d)
Further refinement in the depth of foundation can be done by carrying out elaborate scour calculations.
(e)
Foundations in erosive strata such as soils, sand, silt, etc. should be protected on downstream side with suitable aprons.
Protective apron
: Due to 70 per cent obstruction at road level, a causeway acts, like, a weir and an
increase in velocity of flow causes scouring on the downstream side.
In soils prone to scouring, protection of
the downstream side bed is essential to protect the foundation of the headwall.
Protection may consist of stone apron and toe wall. Protection should be provided for the full width of
the stream at the causeway location.
(a)
For velocities through pipes upto 2.00 m/sec and an afflux upto 450 mm, a 2.5 m long apron with 450 mm thick rubble mat
and toe wall should be provided.
(b)
For velocities through pipes more than 2.00 m/sec and an afflux upto 900 mm, a 4.00 m long apron with 900 mm thick
stone mat upto 2.00 m and then same reduced to 300 mm at the toe end with toe wall, should be provided.
(c)
In no case, the apron length should be less than three times the height of vented causeway above the apron level.
Road crust or paving over causeway
: Since a causeway is expected to allow the flood waters to pass
over
it and is also expected to serve the traffic immediately after the flood recedes, the road surface on the
causeway should be so chosen, that it does not get damaged due to frequent overtopping.
Sufficiently stable pavement should be provided for the full width of the causeway and the protected bed
portion. For approach m cutting, paved side drains should be provided and portion upto
1 .5 m height along the
side slopes should be provided with rubble pitching. Similarly, paving over causeway may comprise of:
(i)
Cement concrete pavement laid over WBM
(ii)
Stone sett pavement on suitable surface
(iii) Rigid pavement with thin carpet
7.2.3.
Design procedure
: Simple approach in designing the causeways by Field Engineers is given
below. As explained earlier, the important components of the vented causeway are vents, rising face walls and
paved road surface, which together ensure stability and prevent outflanking. In that case, the flow condition is
analysed with respect to top of protected bed and if the percentage obstruction to flow at that level is kept below
30 per cent, then normally no outflanking takes place. Thereafter at subsequent floods with higher levels than
PBL, the percentage obstruction will go on reducing and the structure becomes safe in
all conditions.
For
designing, the Field Engineers should find out defined cross-section m the vicinity which represents
soil
conditions truly and all the calculations as mentioned below should be based on the same.
Step by step procedure
:
(i)
Normal hydraulic data, such as, catchment area, annual rainfall, HFL, site plan, L Section, tide level, etc. are collected.
(ii)
Defined cross-section to a natural scale is plotted.
(iii) The cross-section of crossing at proposed location to the natural scale
is plotted.
(iv) The RTL
is decided as low as possible and transferred to the same to the defined cross-section.
(v)
The area below RTL is calculated at the defined cross-section.
150



======================================================================
PAGE 179 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(vi) The vent area is calculated,
i.e., 30 per cent of the area "X" [Refer para 7.
1 .4 "X" of main guidelines (Appendix-7.1) in
case of scanty rainfall] and arrive at the area "A".
(vii) The length of horizontal portion of the face wall and length of rising face wall are decided by trial with following guidelines:
(a)
Length of horizontal portion should be equal to bed width of the channel
plus 4 to
1 0 m additional length
(b)
Suitable gradient of rising face wall
is assumed between
1
:
1 5 to
1 :30.
(c)
For first trial a 300 mm level difference is assumed between RTL and PBL.
(viii) The RTL and PBL are transferred to defined cross-section.
This can be achieved by matching the sill level of the vents
with that of the lowest bed level of the defined cross-section.
(ix) The area of flow available at the vented causeway upto protected bed is calculated.
This consists of the area of vents and
the area between road level and protected bed top level
- "X" + = "AC".
(x)
The area at the defined cross section
is calculated for the corresponding level of protected bed.
Y+X = "AN"
(xi) The percentage obstruction to flood shall be:
(AN -AC) /AN
x
100
If the obstruction is not less than 30 per cent, then steps (vii) to (xi) are repeated by increasing the toplevel of the protected
bed by 200 mm.
(xii) The proposal, which would give percentage obstruction less than 30 per cent
is finalised.

CHAPTER
8
CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIFICATIONS
8.1.
Introduction
The performance of roads is directly linked with quality of construction. Road construction techniques
have been upgraded recently and use ofnew and alternate materials have been advocated for all type of roads.
It is logical to see that the purpose of road construction is to provide a firm, durable and even surface of the
pavement which could stand the stress imparted due to traffic and climatic conditions. The road construction
activity starts from earthwork for embankment and completes with high quality surface finish with bituminous
or concrete construction. Each component of the road has appropriate construction requirements and specification
to be followed. This Chapter deals with details of construction techniques and specifications for various pavement
courses involving use of traditional as well as alternate and locally available materials for all-weather rural
roads.
8.2.
Selection of Materials and Methodology
The typical rural road consists of embankment/subgrade constructed using local soils, sub-base or a
blanket layer of moorum, gravel or similar granular material followed by base course and sealing with thin
bituminous surface course. Rural roads may also be provided with cement concrete pavement and/or special
pavement wherever felt essential. The construction techniques for rural roads could be broadly classified as
follows:
(i)
Conventional methods
(ii)
Mechanised methods
(iii)
Intermediate techniques
The details are discussed in the following Sections:
8.2.1.
Materials and source
: The quality of materials, lead to the borrow areas and climatic
conditions are key factors for cost effective construction. Selection of materials shall be strictly as per guidelines
given in Chapters 3 and 4 on climatic factors and road materials.
8.2.2.
Construction techniques
: Conventional construction methods are typically labour based and
most of the construction operations are done manually. In case of mechanised method of construction, most of
the operations are done with machines like grader, bulldozer, and paver, etc. Vibratory roller may also be used
for compaction where these are available. The selection of construction methodology will be based on various
considerations. No doubt, a modern mechanised method will lead to larger and faster output and will also help
in maintaining the better quality of construction. However, considering the magnitude and scattered nature of
these works in remote areas of the country, modern mechanised methods may not be always cost effective in
case of rural roads. In manual methods, use of local material and manpower is effectively made. These methods
generate the fruitful employment to the local people and also give them satisfaction of participation in their
asset building. On account of availability of cheaper and abundant labour, only labour intensive methods have
so far been largely used for rural road construction in the country.
Hence, complete mechanisation
is not
considered necessary for rural roads.
Almost all road construction activities can be carried out manually
except obligatory items like transportation of materials, paving and rolling.
In case of the hilly and remote areas, labour has to be brought from plains due to paucity of local labour.
The construction of roads in some areas requires extensive blasting and the roads have to be carved through
very steep and vertical rock faces.
Thus exclusive dependence on manual labour for work in hilly areas has

associated safety hazards. Due to severe climatic conditions also in most of the hilly areas, the fair weather
period available for work is also less. Some of the hilly areas have heavy rainfall or snowfall for major portion
of the year. Since the time available for work is limited, mechanisation is a necessity to achieve high productivity
during the available short time in some special cases.
8.2.3.
Machinery and tools
:
In India, road construction activities are accomplished
in various
stages. The tools, appliances and equipment required for different construction activities may also be classified
as manual and mechanised method. Most of the tools and appliances used by manual labour for various phases
of construction are conventional tools and appliances common to all the activities and phases of construction.
Special tools, appliances and equipment are also used for special construction activities like bituminous work
and construction of concrete road, etc. Some machines/equipments, like, dozers, compressors, crushers, loader
and load carriers are also common to most of the construction activities where mechanised methods are adopted.
The list of tools, appliances and equipment required for semi-mechanised method is given in Appendix-8.1.
On major projects, the work of bulky and repetitive nature can be done more economically and efficiently by
well-designed machines.
Practically every operation in construction of roads can be performed by different
types of equipment, but under any given set of conditions only a particular type of machine would be most
effective. Thus selection of machine for any particular phase of construction requires detailed study about
brand, model and specifications of the various equipment available and their suitability for particular phase of
construction.
IRC publication "MOST Handbook on Road Construction Machinery", may be referred for
further details. The surface evenness and compaction are generally checked with camber board/template, straight
edge, depth gauge and density measuring kit. Recently unevenness indicator and nuclear density meters have
also been introduced for exercising quality control. A list of plants, equipment commonly required for different
phases of mechanised construction is given in Appendix-8.2.
8.3.
Embankment and Subgrade
Construction of embankment and preparation of subgrade are part of earthwork. The main activities
associated with construction are, soil survey and identification of borrow areas, construction of embankment
and subgrade. The details are discussed in the following paragraphs.
8.3.1.
Embankment with conventional earth
: The height of road embankment depends on the
highest flood level (HFL) in area generally 0.6 to
1 .0 m height above HFL is to be ensured. The embankment
may be constructed by rolling in relatively thin layers. Each layer should be compacted by suitable roller to a
desired density before the next layer is placed. Compaction should be carried out at optimum moisture content
so as to take advantage of maximum dry density using a specified compacting effort and equipment.
The
thickness of each compacted layer may vary between 150 to 300 mm depending upon various factors such as
soil type, compaction equipment and specifications. Using ordinary 8-10 tonne rollers, compacted thickness
shall not exceed 150 mm. IRC:36, IRC:56, IRC:75 may be referred for construction of embankments.
For identification of suitable borrow area, samples may be collected at different depths from the test pits
dug open in borrow areas from where the embankment material
is to be obtained. The
soil for processing
should be brought to proper moisture content, so that the needed degree of compaction can be imparted with
least effort. Needed amount of water should be quite uniformly dispersed in the entire soil mass. Depending
upon the weather conditions and time gap between sprinkling of water and commencement of rolling, an
allowance of 3 to 4 per cent for evaporation should be made in the quantity of water to be added during summer
when temperature is greater than 35°C, in winter this allowance may be reduced to
1 to 2 per cent. For earthwork
construction, the loose thickness of the soil layer should not normally exceed 200 mm when ordinary 8-10
tonne rollers are used.
184



======================================================================
PAGE 214 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
When the earthwork has reached a stage where the general form of the final shape of the embankment
has been obtained, the spreading of earth should be done
in straight reaches to a crowned shape, and to
appropriately banked profile if the reach
is on a curve.
The moisture content in the laid soil should be the
optimum moisture content subjected to the permitted tolerance. Highly expansive soils such as black cotton
soil should be compacted at the specified moisture content, which is usually on the wet side of the optimum
moisture content. The tolerance limits of variation from the specified moisture content OMC are normally +1
per cent to -2 per cent for sandy/silty soils and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) to +2 per cent for clayey/
black cotton soils. Earth to be used should be good soil, free from slumps, roots and leaves of trees, plants and
rubbish.
The clots should be broken to less than 75 mm size. The equipment for compaction of earthwork
should be ordinarily an 8- 1 0 tonne smooth wheeled power roller. However, if such a power roller is not available,
the use of lighter rollers of 6 to 8 tonne weight may be permitted. In such cases, the thickness of loose soil layer
should be suitably reduced and the number of passes needs to be increased to achieve the desired density.
Densities to be aimed at in the compaction process shall be chosen with due regard to factors such as soil
type, height ofembankment, drainage conditions, position of individual layers and type of available compaction
machinery.
Each compacted layer shall be tested in the field for density and compacted fully before the
operations for the next layer commence. The minimum field density in case of the embankment shall not be
less than 97 per cent Standard Proctor compaction (IS:2720 (Part 7)-1980).
The overall profile should be
improved with each successive layer so that the subgrade level is approached. The profile of the formation is as
per lines and grades.
8.3.2.
Embankment using coal ash (Fly Ash, Pond Ash. and Bottom Ash)
: Coal ash can be used
for construction ofembankment ofrural road projects near thermal power plants. When embankment construction
is undertaken using coal ash, the top soil from all areas to be covered by the embankment foundation should be
stripped to specified depth not exceeding
1 50 mm and stored in stockpiles of height not exceeding 2 m, for use
in covering the coal ash embankment slopes, cut slopes and other disturbed areas where revegetation is desired.
Top
soil should not be unnecessarily trafficked either before stripping or when m stockpiles. The various
construction steps shall be as given in Chapter 9. The following end product specification as given in Table 8.1
has been suggested for construction of coal ash embankments.
Table 8.1.

Embankment shall be constructed evenly over their full width and the contractor shall control and direct
construction plant and other vehicular traffic uniformly across the width. Damage by the construction equipment
or other vehicular traffic shall be made good by the contractor with material having the same characteristics
and strength as it had before it was damaged. Embankments shall not be constructed with steeper side slopes or
to greater width than those shown in the drawings. Whenever embankment construction
is to be taken up
against the face of natural slope or sloping earthworks face including embankments, cuttings and excavations
steeper than
1 :4 (Vertical: Horizontal), such faces shall be benched immediately before placing the subsequent
fill. A less permeable capping layer of selected earth should be constructed on the top of coal ash embankment,
which would form the subgrade for the road pavement. The thickness of this layer should not be less than 500
mm. IRC:SP:58 may be referred for detailed procedure.

8.3.3.
Subgrade with natural earth
: The preparation of subgrade includes all operations before
the pavement structure could be laid over it and compacted. Thus the preparation of subgrade would include
site clearance (if the formation already exists), grading (embankment or cut section) and compaction to desired
density at optimum moisture. The subgrade may be situated on embankment or excavation or at the existing
ground surface. In all the cases, site should be cleared off and the top soil consisting of grass, roots, rubbish and
other organic matter are to be removed. The grading operation is started thereafter so as to bring the vertical
profile of the subgrade to designed grade and camber. Bulldozers, tippers and blade graders are useful equipment
to speed up this work. Highly clayey and black cotton soil shall not be used directly as a subgrade material. In
such case a capping layer of 100 mm thickness shall be provided with material ofCBR higher than 10 per cent
or geo-textile shall be used as a filter material, if found economical.
In case the reach is in cutting and m-situ
soil is to be used for subgrade, the method consists in loosening of the soil to appropriate depth to compact to
a thickness of 300 mm bringing the moisture to required level and compacting it with a suitable roller to 100
per cent
Standard Proctor compaction density. The compaction process should commence at the edges and
progress towards the centre except at super-elevated portions where
it shall commence from lower edge and
progress towards higher edge. When the reach is in fillings,
it is necessary to ensure that at least the top 300
mm of the embankment constituting the subgrade of the pavement should be compacted to 100 per cent of
Standard Proctor compaction density in at least two layers at optimum moisture content. The subgrade should
be finished to the desired profiles; a camber board should be used to check the cross slope.
8.3.4.
Subgrade with stabilised earth
: When the soil does not fulfil
the requirements of normal
subgrade soil, a stabilisation technique can be used to modify and improve the same.
Stabilisation is of four
different types as follows:
(a)
Stabilisation with lime and sand
(b)
Stabilisation with coal ash
(c)
Stabilisation with soft aggregates
(d)
Stabilisation with gravel/moorum
(e)
Stabilisation with cement
The salient features of construction of the above stabilisation techniques are given below:
(a) Stabilisation with lime and sand
: The specification involves mixing of clay with sand so that the
resulting mixture will have a certain controlled plasticity and certain minimum percentage of sand content.
It
is intended mainly for clayey type of soils.
Depending upon the natural moisture of the borrow pit soil, the
borrow areas may be pre-wetted for facilitating excavation.
The clay shall be excavated and clods shall be
broken with wooden mallets or by 4-6 passes of a tractor-towed disc harrows, so that, by and large there are no
clods larger than 10-12 mm. The soil shall be spread in place to the required loose thickness.
The requisite
quantity of lime (2 per cent) and sand transported from local sources
is then added.
To bring the moisture
content to the optimum value, the required quantity of water is added. The wet soil is then mixed thoroughly
and laid on the compacted subgrade to proper profile to a width greater than the pavement width by
1 50 mm on
either side. The loose thickness of the soil layer shall not exceed 200 mm. Depth blocks should be used for the
control of the required layer thickness.
Soil shall be compacted with 8-10 tonne roller to achieve 100 per cent
Standard Proctor compaction density (IRC:49, IRC:51).
(b) Stabilisation with coal ash
:
The clayey subgrade can be stabilised using coal ash, e.g., fly ash,
pond ash and bottom ash as per details given in Chapter 9 and IRC:SP:58 and IRC:88.
186



======================================================================
PAGE 216 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(c) Stabilisation of soil with soft aggregates
: This specification involve use of locally available soft
aggregates such as brick bats, kankar and latente in soil mass for stabilisation. The soft aggregate to be added
to the soil shall be of size less than 30 mm with most of it coarser than 6 mm. The soft aggregates to be added
shall have aggregate impact value not more than 50 per cent. The soil and aggregates should be mixed together
in the ratio 70:30 by volume.
The construction shall be carried out in a manner similar to stabilised soil
technique stated in Section 8.3.4 (part a).
Soil and soft aggregates shall be spread m the above said proportion
and then the resulting material
is mixed, watered and laid to proper camber. On spread soil-aggregate mix,
stone aggregates of 25 mm size should be spread to single layer thickness uniformly at the rate of 0.20 to 0.23
cum/10 sqm. The layer of stabilised soil alongwith the super-imposed layer of grafting stone should be rolled.
The rolling is done in two to three stages.
Relatively light rolling is done on the first day. The same evening
hungry spots are made up with the stabilised soil mix and water should be sprinkled on the surface as may be
necessary.
Rolling shall be resumed the following day (IRC:28, IRC:63).
(d)
Stabilisation with gravel/moorum
: The material to be used shall be graded and shall contain a
fair proportion of all the particle sizes together with sufficient fines to provide proper cohesion. The maximum
aggregate size should generally not exceed one-third the thickness of compacted stabilised layer. The construction
shall be carried out in the same manner as for the stabilised soil construction stated in Section 8.3.4 (part a).
Care shall be taken that the layer is thoroughly compacted and laid to proper profiles.
(e)
Stabilisation with cement
:
The cement for cement stabilisation shall comply with the requirements
of IS:269, 455 or 1489. The mix design shall be done on the basis of 7 days unconfined compressive strength
(UCS) and/or durability test under 12 cycles of wet-dry conditions. The laboratory strength values shall be at
least 1.5 times the minimum field UCS value stipulated in the contract. The construction procedure as regard
spreading and mixing the stabiliser except that cement or combination of lime and cement as the case may be,
shall be used as the stabilising material. The care shall be taken to see that the compaction of cement stabilised
material is completed within two hours of its mixing or such a shorter period as may be found necessary in dry
weather (IRC:50).
8.3.5.
Surface drains
: The fast disposal ofrunoff on the road surface is achieved by surface drainage.
Surface drains shall be excavated to the specified lines, grades, levels and dimensions based on the type of the
drain as mentioned in Chapter 6. The excavated material shall be removed from the area adjoining the drains
and if found suitable, utlised in embankments or subgrade construction. All unsuitable materials shall be disposed
of as directed. The excavated bed and sides of the drains shall be dressed to bring this in close conformity with
the specified dimensions, levels and slopes as mentioned in Chapter 6. If required, the drains shall be lined with
suitable material.
8.4.
Sub-Base (Granular)
Sub-base is an intermediate layer between subgrade and granular base course. The function of this layer
is as a drainage layer for the pavement to avoid excessive wetting and weakening of subgrade. Various materials
and techniques are used for construction of sub-base course. Various types of construction for sub-base, which
are appropriate for rural road, are detailed here.
8.4.1.
Granular sub-base (GSB)
: The grading for coarse graded GSB for construction of sub-base
course shall be as given in Table 8.2 after conducting the wet sieve analysis.

Note:
The material passing 425 micron sieve for all the three grading when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 5) shall be having liquid
limit and plasticity index not more than 25 and 6 respectively.
The material with CBR >15 per cent shall be accepted for
construction of GSB course. (MoRT&H Specifications for Road and Bridge Works).
Immediately prior to the laying of sub-base, subgrade shall be prepared with the help of a motor grader
of adequate capacity. The granular material for sub-base shall be preferably natural. Mixing of ingredients to
make granular sub-base may be undertaken under strict quality control. Manual methods shall be permitted
only where the width of laying is not adequate for mechanical operations or in small sized jobs.
Moisture
content of loose material shall be checked in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 2). After water has been added (at
+ 1 per cent to -2 per cent ofOMC as per IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1 983 ), the material shall be processed by mechanical
or other approved means like disc harrows, rotavators until the layer is uniformly wet. Immediately thereafter,
rolling shall start. The thickness of single compacted layer shall not exceed 100 mm.
Rolling shall commence at the lower edge and proceed towards the upper edge longitudinally for portions
having unidirectional cross fall and super elevation.
It shall commence at the edges and progress towards the
centre for portions having cross fall on both sides. Each pass of the roller shall uniformly overlap not less than
one-third of the track made in the preceding pass. Rolling shall be continued till the density achieved is at least
98 per cent of the IS heavy compaction density for the material as per IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983. The surface of
any layer of material on completion of compaction shall be well closed, free from movement under compaction
equipment and from compaction plane, ridges, cracks or loose material.
8.4.2.
Coarse sand sub-base
: The coarse to medium sand sub-base gives comparatively more
effective drainage to pavement, where the embankment is clayey or black cotton soil.
Sand layer shall be
provided as a part of sub-base over the compacted subgrade layer where annual rainfall is more than 1000 mm.
The sand layer shall normally be in 100 to 150 mm compacted thickness (necessary arrangements shall be
made for local confinement of sand). The coarse to medium sand for construction of a drainage layer shall
conform to grading given in Table 8.3.

The sand conforming to the grading as given in Table 8.3 shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the
prepared subgrade in required quantities from stockpiles along the side of the road or directly from tippers.
Immediately following the spreading of the sand, watering shall be done and rolling shall be started with
vibratory roller of approved type at optimum moisture conditions decided before construction or through
saturation/vibration

8.4.3.
Gravel roads
: The gravel of appropriate quality can be used for construction of surface course
(gravel road) of rural roads. The material to be used shall be graded and shall contain a fair proportion of all the
particle sizes together with sufficient fines to provide proper cohesion as per technical grading limits given in
Section 8.3. The maximum aggregate size should generally not exceed one third the thickness of compacted
layer. The construction shall otherwise be carried out in the same manner as for the mechanically stabilised soil
construction. Care shall be taken that the layer is thoroughly compacted and laid to proper profiles at optimum
moisture content. The compaction shall be at least 98 per cent of the IS heavy compaction density.
8.4.4.
Use of low cost alternate materials
: The use of local and waste materials is always economical
in construction sector. Sometimes locally available construction materials are not suitable in their natural form
and thus needs further treatment. Some of these materials for sub-base and base course construction are:
(a)
Lime stabilised sub-base
(b)
Coal ash
(c)
Slags
(d)
Municipal wastes
(e)
Marble waste
The construction details of sub-base and base courses using these materials are as given below:
(a)
Lime stabilised sub-base
:
The specifications for lime stabilised
soil construction shall apply
essentially to stabilisation of clay including black cotton soils. As mentioned earlier, the borrow areas may be
previously watered for easy excavation.
For lime stabilisation, the soil before addition of stabiliser shall be
pulverised using agricultural equipments like disc harrows and rotavators to the extent that
it passes the
requirements set out in Table 8.4 when tested. In case of black cotton soil, the borrow areas shall be previously
watered and the clods, which are generally in the size of 100-150 mm should be pulverised with agricultural
equipment. The pulverised soil-moorum/black cotton soil shall be spread on the prepared receiving surface,
and slaked lime spread over
it in the required quantity.
The laid material shall be cut and mixed 2-3 times
manually so that a homogenous soil-lime mix is formed. Lime-soil stabilisation shall not be done when the air
temperature is less than 10°C.

Addition of lime: Lime may be mixed with the prepared material either in slurry form or dry state as
approved by the Engineer. The tops of windrowed material may be flattened or slightly trenched to receive the
lime. The distance to which lime may be spread upon the prepared material ahead of the mixing operation shall
be determined by the Engineer. The moisture content at compaction shall neither be less than optimum moisture
content corresponding to IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983, nor more than 2 percent above it. The staking of lime for lime
stabilised sub-base shall be done properly. Manual mixing of lime should be discharged.
It can be undertaken
in special cases, if the equipment is not available. The soil from borrow areas shall be first freed of all vegetation
and the deleterious materials and placed on the prepared subgrade. The soil shall then be pulverised by means
of crowbars, pick axes or other means. Water in requisite quantities may be sprinkled on the soil for pulverisation.
On the pulverised
soil, the blending material
in requisite quantities shall be spread uniformly and mixed
thoroughly by working with spades or other similar implements till the whole mass is uniform. After adjusting
the moisture content within the limits mentioned, the material shall be levelled upto the required thickness so
that it is ready to be rolled.
189



======================================================================
PAGE 219 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Rolling: Immediately after spreading, grading and levelling of the mixed material and compaction shall
be carried out with approved equipment preceded by a few passes of lighter rollers if necessary.
Rolling shall
commence at edges and progress towards the centre, except at super elevated portions where it shall commence
at the lower edge and progress toward higher edge. During rolling, the surface shall be checked for grade and
camber and any irregularities corrected by loosening the material and renovmg/addmg fresh material.
Compaction shall continue until the density achieved is at least 98 per cent of the IS heavy compaction density
for the material determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1 983
. Care shall be taken to see that the
compaction of lime stabilised material is completed within three hours of its mixing. The final surface shall be
well closed, free from movement under compaction planes, ridges, cracks or loose material.
All loose or
segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be made good to the full thickness of the layer and re-compacted.
Curing: The sub-base shall be cured for moist curing with water for a minimum period of 7 days after
which subsequent pavement courses shall be laid to prevent the surface from drying out and becoming friable.
(b) Use of coal ash
: Sub-base course can be constructed using pond ash or bottom ash replacing
conventionally used moorum or granular materials. Lime fly ash bound macadam using lime stabilised filler
(mixture of lime, fly ash and sand or moorum) will inhibit softening m presence of water leading to longer life
and better serviceability of the roads. The details of all such construction using coal ash are given in Chapter 9.
(c) Use of slags
:
Slags from various metallurgical industries can also be used for construction of sub-
base of rural roads. The details are given in Chapter 9.
(d) Use of municipal wastes
:
The granulated processed municipal waste can also be used for construction of sub-base course. The
details are given in Chapter 9.
(e) Use of marble waste
: The marble slurry dust is a waste of marble cutting industry and
it can be
utilized in stabilization of granular soil and sand using lime and other chemical additives. The details are given
in Chapter 9.
8.5.
Base Course (Granular)
The following specifications are recommended for construction of granular base course:
(a)
Water Bound Macadam
(b)
Crusher Run Macadam
(c)
Use of Alternate Materials
8.5.1.
Water bound macadam (WBM)
(a) Grading
:
WBM may be used as sub-base as well as base course and also surface course of rural roads.
In each
case,
it shall be constructed in conformity with line, grades and cross-section shown on the drawings of the
tender document.
The existing surface of the subgrade, sub-base or base to receive WBM course, shall be
prepared to the required grade and camber and cleaned of all dust. Any ruts or soft yielding places that have
appeared due to improper drainage of surface under traffic or season shall be corrected and rolled. The grading
of aggregates shall conform to requirements given in the Tables 8.5 and 8.6. The quantity of binding materials,
where
it
is to be used will depend on the type of screenings.
Generally, the quantity required for 75 mm
compacted thickness of water bound macadam will be 0.06-0.09 cum/10 sqm. The quantity shall be in the
range of 0.08-0.1 cum/10 sqm for 100 mm compacted thickness. Necessary arrangements shall be made for the

lateral confinement of aggregates.
There may be construction of side shoulders in advance to a thickness
corresponding to the compacted layer of the WBM course.
After shoulders are ready, inside edges may be
trimmed vertical and included area cleaned of all spilled material thereby setting the stage for spread of coarse
aggregates.
Table 8.7 gives the quantities of materials (loose) required for 10 sqm for sub-base/base course

The compacted thickness for a layer with grading
1 shall be 100 mm while with grading 2 and 3 shall be
75 mm. Grading 2 and 3 shall be preferably used for construction of Water Bound Macadam for rural roads.
(b) Spreading and rolling of coarse aggregates
: The coarse aggregates shall be spread uniformly and
evenly upon the prepared base in required quantities from stockpiles along the side of the road or directly from
vehicle.
In no case shall these be dumped in heaps directly on the area where neither these are to be laid nor shall
their hauling over a partly completed base be permitted. The aggregates shall be spread to proper profile by
using templates placed across the road about 6 m apart. Where possible approved mechanical devices shall be
used to spread the aggregates uniformly so as to minimise the need for their manipulation by hand. The WBM
course shall normally be constructed m layers of not more than 75 mm compacted thickness.
However, for
aggregates of grading No. 1 the compacted thickness shall be 100 mm. No segregation of large or fine particles
shall be allowed.
The coarse aggregates, as spread shall be of uniform gradation with no pockets of fine
material. Immediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregates rolling shall be started with 3 wheeled
power roller of 8-10 tonne capacity or tandem or vibratory roller of approved type.
The type of roller to be used shall be approved by the Engmeer-in-Charge based on trial run. Except on
superelevated portions where the rolling shall proceed from inner to the outer edge, rolling shall begin from the
edges gradually progressing towards the centre.
First the edges shall be compacted with roller running forward
and backward. The roller shall then move inwards parallel to the centre line of the road, in successive passes
uniformly overlapping preceding tracks by at least one half of the width.
Rolling shall be discontinued when
the aggregates are partially compacted with sufficient void space in them to permit application of screenings.
However, where screenings are not to be applied as in the case of crushed aggregates like brick metal, laterite
and kankar, compaction shall be continued until the aggregates are thoroughly keyed.
During rolling slight
sprinkling of water may be done, if necessary. Rolling shall not be done when the sub-grade is soft or yielding
or when it causes a wave like motion in the sub-grade or sub-base course. The rolled surface shall be checked
transversely and longitudinally with templates and any irregularities corrected by loosening the surface by
adding or removing necessary amount of aggregates and re-rolling until the entire surface conforms to the
desired camber and grade.
In no case shall the use of screenings be permitted to make up depressions.
(c) Application of screenings
:
After coarse aggregates have been rolled, screenings shall be applied
gradually over the surface to fill the interstices. Dry rolling shall be done when the screenings are being spread
so that the jarring effect of roller causes them to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregates. The screenings
shall not be dumped in piles but applied uniformly in successive thin layers either by spreading motion of hand
shovels, mechanical spreaders or directly from trucks. Trucks plying over the base course to spread screenings
shall be equipped with pneumatic tyres and so operated as not to disturb the coarse aggregates. The screenings
shall be applied at a slow rate in three oi more applications as necessary. Rolling or brooming shall accompany
this.
In no case shall the screenings be applied so fast and thick as to form cakes or ridges on the surface
making the filling of voids difficult or preventing the direct bearing of roller on the coarse aggregates.
After
the application of screenings, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, swept and rolled.
Hand
brooms shall be used to sweep the wet screenings into voids and to distribute them evenly.
The sprinkling,
sweeping and rolling operations shall be continued and additional screenings applied where necessary until the
coarse aggregates are well bounded and firmly set. Grout of screenings and water formed ahead of the wheels
of rollers shall be taken out so that the base or sub-grade does not get damaged due to addition of excessive
quantities of water during the construction.
(d)
Application of binding material
: After the application of screenings, binding material (PI«4-6)
that is required to be used shall be applied at a uniform rate in two or more successive thin layers. After each
192



======================================================================
PAGE 222 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
application of binding material, the surface shall be sprinkled with water and the resulting slurry swept in with
brooms so as to
fill the voids properly.
After final compaction, the road shall be allowed to cure overnight.
Next morning, hungry spots shall be filled with screenings or binding material lightly sprinkled with water, if
necessary it may be also rolled. No traffic shall be allowed till the macadam sets.
In the case of WBM base
course to be provided with bituminous surfacing, the latter shall be laid only after the WBM course is completely
dry and primed before allowing any traffic on
it.
8.5.2.
Crusher run macadam (CRM)
: The work shall consist of furnishing, placing and compacting
crushed stone aggregate sub-base and base courses constructed in accordance with the requirements set forth in
this specification and in conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses and cross-sections shown on the plan or
as directed by the Engmeer-m-Charge.
The grading shall conform to the grading and quality requirements
shown in Table 8.8.

The aggregate shall be uniformly deposited on the approved subgrade by means of the hauling vehicle
with or without spreading devices. Aggregates will be distributed over the surface to the depth specified on the
plans or as directed by the Engmeer-in-Charge. After the base course material has been deposited,
it shall be
thoroughly mixed to full depth of layer by alternately blading the entire layer to the centre and back to the edges
of the road.
It shall then be spread and finished to the required cross-section by means of a motor grader. Water
shall be applied prior to and during all blading and processing operations to moisten the material sufficiently to
prevent segregation of the fine and coarse particles.
Water shall be applied in sufficient quantity during
construction to assist in compaction. Compaction shall commence immediately after the spreading operation.
If the thickness of single compacted layer does not exceed
1 00 mm, a smooth wheel roller of 8- 1 0 tonne weight
may be used.
For a compacted single layer upto 200 mm, the compaction shall be done with the help of
vibratory roller of minimum of 8-10 tonne or equivalent capacity. The speed of the roller shall not exceed 5
km/h. Each layer of material shall be compacted to not less than 98 per cent of the IS heavy compaction density
asperIS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983.
8.5.3.
Use of special material
: The details are given in Chapter 9.
8.6.
Shoulder
Shoulder gives adequate side support to the pavement and also drains off surface water from the
carriageway to the road side drain.
8.6.1.
Construction of shoulders
: The construction shall be done
in layers each matching the
thickness of adjoining layer. Only after a layer ofWBM, shoulder shall be laid and compacted. Next corresponding
layers in pavement shall be taken up after the completion of first layer ofWBM and shoulder. This procedure
shall be followed upto the surface course. In the case of bituminous courses, work on shoulder shall start only
193



======================================================================
PAGE 223 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
after the pavement course has been laid and compacted. The compaction requirement of earthen shoulder shall
be 100 per cent of Standard Proctor compaction density
as per IS:2720 (Part 7)- 1980.
During all stages of shoulder construction, the required cross fall shall be maintained to drain off surface
water. Regardless of the method of laying all shoulder construction material shall be placed on the shoulder.
Any spilled material dragged on to the pavement surface
shall be immediately removed without damage to the
pavement.
8.7.
Bituminous Constructions
Rural roads are expected to have very low traffic, and therefore, any all-weather surfacing will provide
the needed connectivity. But, where there is reasonable volume of motorised traffic, thin bituminous surfacing
will be desirable.
This section deals with construction of all different bituminous construction required for
flexible pavement. The basic objective of providing thin bituminous surfacing on rural roads is to seal granular
surface cost effectively and to reduce maintenance efforts.
8.7.1.
Prime coat on granular surfaces
: Prime coat is a spray application of low viscosity liquid
bituminous material on top of the top most granular layer of the base course.
Prime coat performs following
important functions.
Coats and bonds loose mineral particles of granular surface
Water proofs the surface of the base by plugging capillary or interconnected voids
Provides adhesion or bond between the granular base and bituminous layers
The primer shall be a slow setting bitumen emulsion complying with IS:8887-1 995, or medium curing
cut-back as per 18:217-1983. The use of medium curing cut-back shall be restricted to sub zero temperature
conditions only. The procedure for preparation of cut-back for primer is given in Appendix-8.3. The requirement
of viscosity and quantity of liquid bituminous materials to be used for priming shall be as given in Table 8.9.

The primer can be applied using one of the following equipments as decided by Engineer-in-Charge:
Self propelled distributor
Towed bitumen pressure sprayer
Hand sprayer (for small works)
Prior to applying the primer, the surface shall be carefully swept or brushed clean of dust and loose
particles. The desirable range of temperature of cutback as primer for grades, viz., MC-30, MC-70, MC-250
shall be 30 to 55°C, 50 to 80°C and 75 to 100°C respectively. Emulsion as primer can be sprayed at 20-60°C. A
primed surface shall be allowed to cure for atleast 24 hours before application ofnext bituminous layer. Emulsion
for priming always requires dilution with water in
1
: 1 ratio (water: emulsion). A very thin layer of clean sand
may be applied to the surface of the primer to prevent the primer picking up under wheels of paver or trucks
delivering material for construction of bituminous layer.
8.7.2.
Tack coat application
: Tack coat is a very light application of liquid bituminous material on
a bituminous layer when a new layer is to be laid over it.
It is used to create a bond between a new bituminous
layer to be placed on the existing bituminous or a primed granular layer. The following types of liquid bituminous
194



======================================================================
PAGE 224 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
materials can be used for tack coat applications:
Rapid or medium or slow setting type emulsion (IS: 8887-
1 995
)
RC-70 or MC-70 grade cutback bitumen (IS:21 7-1 988)
Hot bitumen
The existing surface shall be made slightly damp in case of tack coat using emulsion and dry if bitumen
or cutback bitumen
is used. Hot bitumen or cut back bitumen may be used in special case, where
it is felt
necessary for climatic reasons. The tack coat may be sprayed by one of the following equipments:
Self propelled pressure distributor
Towed bitumen sprayer
Pressure hand sprayers
Perforated cans for small areas
The surface to be tack coated must be clean, free of loose material and dust. In case emulsion is used for
tack coat, the bituminous layer is placed after complete breaking of emulsion as indicated by change in colour
from brown to black. The recommended quantities of liquid bituminous material for tack coat are as given in
Table 8.10.
Table 8.10. Recommended Quantities of Liquid Bituminous Material for Tack Coat
Types of Surface
Quantity per 10 sqm
Granular (Primed)
Bituminous Surface
3.0 kg
2.5 kg
If, the existing surface is a freshly laid bituminous layer, a tack coat is not mandatory and it may not be
required at all.
8.7.3.
Modified penetration macadam (MPM)
: A thm premix carpet (20-25 mm) laid directly on
granular surface gets deteriorated fast if the traffic is reasonably high. Thicker treatments, like, DBM and BM
are costly and for level of traffic on rural road does not justify the same. Therefore,
it
is essential to have
transition/intermediate layer. One can, therefore, consider the use ofpenetration macadam, modified penetration
macadam, built-up spray grout etc. for such special cases.
Built-up spray grout involves use of mechanically
crushed metal. However, the requirement of crushed metal is reduced m the case of penetration macadam and
modified penetration macadam, as hand broken metal by local unskilled rural labour can be used and is also
cost effective. In such a situation,
it is desirable to replace the top layer of WBM by one layer of MPM. The
specifications ofMPM are given in Appendix-8.4.
8.7.4.
Bituminous macadam
: Construction of bituminous macadam may be required in specific
locations, only for strengthening purpose where traffic is very heavy and laying of bituminous base course is
essential. Bituminous macadam is generally laid in compacted thickness of 50 mm to 100 mm on previously
prepared base, and aggregate for such layer shall conform to grading given in Table 8.11.
The Gradmg-I shall be used for 75-100 mm compacted thickness while Gradmg-II shall be used for 50-
75 mm compacted thickness. The aggregate shall consist of hard crushed rock, crushed gravel, any other
material and of uniform quality conforming to the specifications given in Chapter 4. The bitumen shall be of
paving grade conforming to IS:73-1 992 and grade shall be 80/100 or 60/70 depending upon climatic conditions
(Chapter 4). The 80/100 grade shall be used for cold climate areas or where difference between minimum and
maximum temperature
is more than 20°C, otherwise 60/70 grade bitumen shall be used. The aggregate of
different sizes shall be proportioned and blended to produce a uniform mixture complying with requirements
of grading given in Table 8.1 1. The range of temperature for different construction operations shall be as per
Table 8.12.

The binder content shall be in between 3.1 to 3.5 per cent depending upon the type of aggregate. The
method for preparation of mixture, spreading and rolling shall be as described in Appendix-8.5. The layer of
bituminous macadam shall be covered with wearing coat or subsequent layer within 48 hours. If there is any
delay, surface may be covered by sand seal. The surface finish and other requirements of completed construction
shall comply to quality
control as detailed in Chapter 10.
8.7.5.
Construction of bituminous surfacings
: The following specifications can be used for surface
course of rural roads:
•
Surface dressing
Open graded premix carpet with seal coat
•
Closely graded premix carpet or mix-seal surface
The details of their construction procedures are given in following Sub-Sections.
8.7.5.1.
Surface dressing
: The construction of surface dressing may be undertaken in one coat or two
coats.
It
is an age-old technique of surfacing roads, which
is continually modernised in recent years.
In
practical terms, it involves successive spraying and spreading ofbinder and aggregate respectively. The merits
of this type of construction which mainly seals granular surface are:
Binder ensures water proofing of the base layer as well as fixation of aggregates and prevents further oxidation of old
surface
Aggregates serve to ensure contact between the traffic and pavement and provides skid resistant surface
The construction may be conveniently accomplished
in various manner e.g. manually or through
synchronous spreading. The quality and speed ofwork can be achieved by way of synchronised surface dressing.
The machine
is truck mounted with bituminous sprayer and chip spreader. The spreading of bitumen
is
synchronised with respect to application of chips as per design requirement. The binder shall be a liquid
bituminous material, e.g., paving bitumen conforming to IS:73-1992, modified bitumen (IRC:53) or a rapid
setting bitumen emulsion (IS:8887-1995), as decided by the Engmeer-m-Charge.
The aggregates shall be m conformity with specifications given in the Chapter 4.
196

In case water absorption of aggregates exceeds
1 per cent, chips precoated with
1 per cent bitumen may
be used. The quantities of aggregates and binders per 10 sqm shall be as given in Table 8.13

The aggregate shall conform to grading given in Table 8.14. In case of single coat surface dressing,
grading of second coat will be adopted. The rate of spread of binder and aggregate can be calculated by an
engineering approach to design surface dressing based upon determination of average least dimension (ALD)
of aggregate. The concept of ALD has been developed including four factors of traffic, condition of existing
surface, climate and type of chipping. The factors for these four characteristics are given in Table 8.15.
The sum of these factors shall be used for calculation of design binder content and chipping application
rate. Determination of design binder content and chipping application rate as shown in Figs. 8.1 and 8.2 or by
the procedure given in "Manual for Construction and Supervision of Bituminous Works" of MoRT&H.

The surface shall be cleaned of dust or loose material either by using a mechanical broom or compressed
air or as specified in the contract or as decided by Engineer-m-Charge.
Equipment used for construction of
surface dressing has a major impact on the quality of finished surface and subsequent performance.
Binder
(paving bitumen or modified bitumen) shall be heated to desired temperature and sprayed on dry surface m a
uniform manner with the help of self propelled mechanical sprayer or any other suitable equipment decided by
the Engineer. The equipment and general procedure shall be in accordance to "Manual for Construction and
Supervision of Bituminous Works" ofMoRT&H (2001 ). Immediately after application of binder, stone chipping
in dry and clean state shall be spread uniformly on the surface by means of a self propelled or towed mechanical
grit spreader to cover the surface completely. Spreading of binder and aggregate can also be accomplished by
synchronised equipment in one step. Immediately after application of cover aggregate, entire surface shall be
rolled with 8-10 tonne smooth wheeled steel roller or 8-10 tonne static weight vibratory roller or any other
approved equipment.
Rolling shall continue until all aggregate particles are finally embedded in binder and
present a uniform closed surface. The second coat of surface dressing if required shall be undertaken after the
surface is exposed to traffic for about
1 5-20 days. A trial patch shall be laid to find out the quantity of bitumen
depending upon the condition of existing surface. However, surface shall be duly cleaned before application of
second coat. Some of the special precautions are necessary during construction of surface dressing as
surface
dressing always matures in summer.
It should not be done under the effects of low temperature and water. The
sweeping of loose aggregate particles after rolling help in prevention of loss of aggregate due to traffic movement.
Traffic shall not be permitted to run on any newly surface dressed until following day. In special circumstances,
traffic may be allowed at the speed of 10-15 km/hour until following day. An example for calculation of design
of surface dressing is given in Appendix-8.6.
8.7.5.2.
Open graded premix carpet with seal coat
: The open graded premix carpet construction
involves use of mixed bituminous material laid in compacted thickness of 20 mm followed by a seal coat. The
aggregate quality for premix carpet shall conform to requirements as given in Chapter 4. In case water absorption
exceeds
1 per cent, the polished stone value as measured by the test in BIS:812 Part II shall be less than 55. The
binder shall be paving bitumen conforming to IS:73- 1 992 or emulsion conforming to IS: 8887- 1995 specifications
or modified bitumen conforming to IRC:SP:53. The quantity of materials needed for 10 sqm road surfaces for
20 mm compacted thickness of open graded premix carpet are given in Table 8.17.

identical as specified in Section 8.7.5.2 and details are given in Appendices-8.5 and 8. 7.
8.8.
Semi-Rigid Pavement Construction
Semi rigid pavements are those having wearing course materials of modulus of elasticity less than
pavement quality concrete and greater than bituminous material.
For example, dry lean cement concrete,
cement fly ash bound macadam, lime fly ash concrete, lime fly ash bound macadam, etc. are some of the semi
rigid materials. These are also used for making Cement Treated Base (CTB). Semi rigid materials have wide
range of compressive strength 40- 1 50 km/sqcm. In case ofrural roads, the wearing course shall be thin bituminous
surface over a semi-rigid base.
Before starting the construction of these roads samples of soil, earth filling
from borrows pits, aggregate, etc. shall be collected. Engineering properties of the same shall be determined as
per IRC/Bureau of Indian Standard Codes (IRC:SP:49, IRC: 15, IRC:SP:11, IS:516-1959 and IS: 1 199-1959).
To get uniform quality of pavement works and their proper mix design, there is a need for the selection of
200



======================================================================
PAGE 230 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
suitable standard materials and equipment
:
(i)
the existing loose soil/subgrade upto adequate depth (depending upon levelling) shall be cut or spread to a camber (2 per
cent) and compacted with road roller 8 to 10 tonne capacity, at optimum moisture content. The maximum dry density
(compacted) in this case shall be as per Section 8.3.3.
(it)
Before, spreading any semi-rigid material or WBM over the subgrade the existing subgrade layer shall be kept wet with
water for 48 hours before compacting with static road roller of 8-10 tonne capacity.
(iii)
Over the compacted subgrade, water bound macadam (macadam thickness
1 50 mm, WBM Grade II) shall be laid in two
layers and compacted separately. A layer of Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) 1:4:8 (cement: sand: coarse aggregate) shall be
laid over compacted moist Water Bound Macadam (WBM) uniformly and then compacted to a thickness of
1 00-1 50 mm.
DLC shall be provided either over the compacted subgrade or over the compacted WBM in case of very weak soil (CBR
2 per cent or less) (Black cotton soil or its equivalent) or in snow bound regions and heavy rainfall areas (rainfall more
than 1000 mm).
(iv)
Dry lean cement concrete with or without fly ash is laid over the compacted and properly cambered sub-base. Dry Lean
Concrete shall be cured with water for minimum fourteen days.
Light traffic may be allowed after 28 days of laying of
pavement.
For higher traffic, a bituminous layer or roller compacted concrete layer may be provided.
This will have
adequate abrasion resistance and structurally adequate surface.
(v)
Any ruts or soft yielding places that appear, due to improper drainage condition, traffic or from any other cause, DLC
shall be corrected and rolled, before laying wearing surface.
(vi)
The coarse aggregates shall not be dumped in heaps directly on the subgrade/WBM within the area over which DLC is to
be spread. The DLC shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared subgrade/WBM
in required quantities
before compaction starts.
(vii)
There should not be any variation of level greater than 10 mm when 3 meter long straight edge
is laid parallel to centre
line of dry lean cement concrete.
(viii) DLC of 10-15 cm thickness (compacted) may be laid in one layer. The layer shall be tested for thickness using wooden
blocks.
(ix)
DLC surface shall be covered with 20 mm thick premix carpet with seal coat or closely graded premix carpet or 20 mm
thick mixed seal surface.
8.9.
Concrete Pavements
8.9.1.
Rigid pavement using pavement quality concrete (PQC)
: Rigid pavement can be constructed
as per the designed based on IRC: 5 8, construction procedure as mentioned in IRC: 15 "Construction of Concrete
Roads" and Clause 602 of MoRT&H Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
8.9.2.
Materials requirements
: The constituents of
rigid
pavements are cement, water sand and
coarse aggregate.
These materials shall be in conforming and in accordance with relevant standard methods of
testing prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards and IRC: 15 "Standard Specification & Code of Practice
for Construction of Concrete Roads". The materials and their specifications
for base, sub-base, and subgrade
preparation shall be as per IRC :SP:49 "Guidelines for the Use of Dry Lean Concrete as Sub-base for Rigid
Pavement" and IRC: 19 "Standard Specification & Code of Practice for Water Bound Macadam". JRC:109
"Guidelines for Wet Mix Macadam" and IRC:60 "Tentative Guidelines for the Use of Lime Fly Ash Concrete
as Pavement Base or Sub-base" and other materials as mentioned in Chapter 4 may also be used as base or sub-
base course
for rigid pavement construction.
8.9.3.
Concrete mix design
:
After selecting the material and their availability, the cement concrete
mix shall be designed as per IRC:44 "Tentative Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for Pavements"
or IS: 10262-1982 for minimum flexural strength of 40 kg/sqcm in the field assuming good degree of quality
control in the field. As per MoRT&H "Specifications for Road and Bridge Works", the cement content in the
pavement quality concrete (PQC) shall
not be less than 350 kg/cum and not more than 425 kg/cum. The
approximate mix proportions
(by weight) generally used is 1:1.5:3.0 [cement: sand (fine aggregate)
: coarse
aggregate] with water/cement ratio 0.38. The exact mix proportion shall be taken only after testing the materials
201



======================================================================
PAGE 231 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
in a recognized laboratory, the supplied cement, aggregate and water to be used at site. If fly ash or any other
specified material is to be added as replacement of cement or sand, as per IS:456-2000 "Code of Practice for
Plain and Reinforced Concrete", the mix proportion accordingly may be changed.
Cement concrete cubes and beams (6 No. each)
shall be cast
daily to check 7 and 28 days strength as
per IRC:SP: 1 1
. The maximum size of coarse aggregate may be upto 20 mm. The aggregate normally used has
water absorption not more than 3 per cent and silt content (size less than 75 micron) shall not exceed 3 per cent
in case of natural aggregate. The flexural strength of concrete obtained in the field shall not be less than 40 kg/
sqcm. The workability of the concrete at the time of placing shall preferably be 10 mm slump.
8.9.4.
Equipment
: Tools, equipments and appliances for concrete pavement construction shall be
as per IRC:43 and IRC:SP:49. Edging tool shall be used for making the sharp edges of the joints in the slabs.
Proper care shall be taken while maki u
edges.
Needle and screed vibrator shall be used for compaction of
concrete. Excessive compaction of the concrete is to be avoided.
It has to be checked that no extra water or
bleeding shall occur on the top surface of concrete. Excessive water at the top will make the top surface very
weak and there will be more abrasion as compared to adequately concrete surface. Edges of concrete shall be
atleast
1 meter away from a tree there, if any.
(a) Preparation of subgrade
:
This shall be as per procedure mentioned for bituminous construction.
For details IRC: 15 "Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Construction of Concrete Roads" may be
referred. We may provide a drainage layer/crack absorbing layer using granular material in addition to the base
course layer in case of very weak subgrade (CBR lass tan or equal to 2 per cent). The thickness of subgrade
shall be
1 50-300 mm. The drainage layer shall consist of well drained material placed on the subgrade, or even
on the existing flexible pavement as a crack arresting layer as well as drainage layer. This may be made up of
natural coarse sand, moorum, gravel, open graded crushed stone, GSB or
its equivalent. The thickness of
drainage layer shall be
1 50 mm (compacted). The drainage layer shall be at proper gradient and camber (1 in 80
in the transverse direction).
(b)
Preparation of base course
: Any of the specified material as mentioned below may be used as
base course for construction of concrete pavement. The following three types of specifications are used for
construction:
(i)
Water Bound Macadam (WBM):
It shall be laid as per the procedure given in Section 8.5.1
(ii)
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM):
It shall be laid as per the procedure laid down in IRC
:
1 09.
(iii)
Dry Lean Cement Concrete with or without fly ash:
It shall be laid as per the procedure laid down in IRCSP.49. The
base course consists of dry lean cement concrete minimum grade M
1 0) placed above subgrade or drainage layer. The base
layer may be of 100-1 50 mm thickness, compacted with road roller 8-10 tonne capacity, at 7 to 8 percent water by weight
of concrete, so that the concrete could take the weight of roller and could be compacted with roller conveniently. The mix
proportion of dry lean concrete (DLC) of grade minimum M
1 0, shall be,
1 :4:8
(
1 cement: 4 sand
: 8 coarse aggregate).
It
shall be laid uniformly and then compacted (Compacted Thickness of DLC =
1 00-
1 50 mm) as per IRC:SP:49. The cement
content
in the DLC shall not be
less than 150 kg/cum.
If fly ash
is available within 50 km radius,
it may be used as
replacement of sand by 50 per cent by weight. Any ruts or soft yielding places that appear due to improper drainage
condition traffic or from any other cause on DLC, shall be corrected and rolled until firm, before the Pavement Quality
Concrete (PQC)
is placed thereon for better compaction of PQC.
(c) PQC wearing course
: Wearing course shall be laid as per the procedure as mentioned in IRC: 15.
In brief the procedure is given here as:
(i)
Fixing of formwork (shuttering) shall be over the base course.
It shall be set to true level and securely fixed in position
to prevent any subsequent disturbance duiing compaction.
(ii)
Manufacture and placement of concrete unless otherwise permitted, the constituents shall be weighed in a batching plant.
Where volume batching
is permifffd, every effort should be made to minimise variation in batching. Mixing of concrete
202



======================================================================
PAGE 232 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
shall be done in a power driven mixer of approved type that will ensure a uniform distribution of materials.
(iii)
Concrete shall be placed on the prepared base between formwork in such a manner as to avoid segregation and uneven
compaction. Concrete shall be deposited within 20 minutes and compacted within 60 minutes in summer and 75 minutes
in winter. Concreting shall not be done when the atmospheric temperature is below 5°C and above 40°C
.
(iv)
Concrete shall be compacted fully using vibrating screed and
internal vibrator. Water
in the fresh concrete should not be
in excess
of the stipulated quantity, otherwise concrete
is likely to crack within very short period after drying. After
compacting and finishing with screed, a float and
then a broomer is used to
finally finish the top surface with required
texture to avoid skidding. Any depressions or high spots showing departures from the true surface shall be immediately
rectified. High spots shall be cut down and refinished. Depressions shall be enlarged to about 80-100 mm and refilled
with the same fresh concrete, compacted and finished. All the above operation shall be completed within 75 minutes in
winter or 60 minutes in summer from the time of adding water into the mix.
(v)
If concrete slab shall be laid in two layers, the second layer shall be placed within 30 minutes of compaction of the lower
layer.
(vi)
Over the compacted DLC, a layer of Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) of thickness
1 50-240 mm shall be laid as per the
design with proper shoulder on both sides of the 3.75 m wide lane. The flexural strength of concrete shall not be less than
40 kg per sqcm. Accordingly the minimum compressive strength of concrete may be approx. 350 kg/sqcm. The actual
relation between compressive and flexural strength of concrete shall be established for calculating the actual flexural
strength of concrete. There should not be any variation more than 12 mm when 3 meter long straight edge is laid parallel
to centre line of the dry lean cement concrete
base course and
1 0 mm for PQC.
(vii)
The layers shall be tested for thickness
with wooden block.
(viii) The coarse aggregate shall not be dumped in heaps directly on the subgrade/DLC within the area over which PQC is to
be spread.
(ix)
Adequate compaction of concrete by suitable vibratory (first by needle vibrator specially at edges and then by screed
vibrators) equipments is necessary.
Every
1 per cent void remaining in the concrete means a loss of strength of the order
of 4-5 per cent.
(x)
The strength of concrete shall be ascertained either from cube or beams specimens. For this purpose, during the progress
of work, cube and beam samples shall be cast for testing at 7 and 28 days as per IS:5 16-1959 and IS:
1 199-1 959. Adequate
quality control should be exercised at all stages of construction by suitable trained staff as per guidelines given in IRC:
1
5
"Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Construction of Concrete Roads" and "Handbook of Quality Control
for Construction of Roads and Runways" (IRC:SP:
1
1 ) and also as per Hill Road Manual (IRC:SP:48).
(xi)
Contraction and expansion joints shall be provided as per the Guidelines mentioned
in IRC: 15 or IRC58. All materials
required for the joints, viz. tie bars at longitudinal joints, dowel bars at expansion joints, expansion joint filler boards and
joint sealing compounds shall be checked for specification requirements as per IS:
1 834 and IRC:57.
(xii)
Curing shall commence soon after the finished pavement surface can take the weight of the wet burlap, cotton or jute mats
normally employed for initial curing, without leaving any marks thereon (IRC:SP:
1
1
). The mats shall extend beyond the
pavement edges at least by 0.5 m and be constantly wetted. Initial curing shall be for 24 hours or till the concrete is hard
enough to permit labour operations without damages. Upto 24 hours no water other than mixing water, should be added
to the surface of concrete except just wet burlaps.
Final curing, after removal of the mats, etc. shall be carried out by wet
ponding earth, ponding of water or other means specified. Where water
is scarce or pavement
is on a steep gradient,
impervious membrane curing shall be adopted as per specified standard of MoRT&H. Pavement can be opened to traffic
after 28 days of curing of concrete slabs.
8.9.5.
Special requirements
(i)
The angle between any two joints should be right angle or obtuse and joints (contraction, longitudinal, expansion)
shall
match with the other joints
to avoid sympathetic cracks in the adjoining slabs.
(ii)
The contraction joints shall be provided by cutting the concrete slab with diamond blade cutter of width 6-8 mm and
depth 60 mm after 48-72 hours of casting the slabs. The contraction joints spacing shall be at 4.5 m c/c filled
with hot
bituminous sealing compound (upto one third of the thickness of PQC) to be provided up to say 60 mm in height (width
6
to 8 mm), as per IRC:1 5. The expansion joint shall be provided as per IRC:
1 5 as a butt joint with dowel bars of dia 30
mm at a spacing of 400 mm centre to centre properly fixed in a steel cage. Expansion joints are provided when thickness
ofPQC is more than 150 mm. The width of the expansion joint shall be 20 mm. Premoulded joint filler board of width 20
mm and height
1
1 0-200 mm Over the board hot sealing compound may be filled.
203

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(iii)
If dry fly ash of lime reactivity greater than 40 kg/sqcm is available within reasonable lead (say 50 km), the same may be
used as replacement of cement by
1 0-20 per cent as performance improver in Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) or 50 per
cent of sand can also be replaced by fly ash in Dry Lean Cement Concrete (DLC)
to have better durability, less heat of
hydration and better
finishing provided 28 days strength
of PQC or DLC
is not reduced.
(iv)
Unless special precautions are taken, concreting shall not be done when atmospheric temperature in shade is above 40°C
or below 5°C (IRC:61).
(v)
The tools and equipments should be according to IRC:43.
8.9.6.
Roller compacted concrete pavement
(i)
For construction of roller compacted concrete pavement as a rigid pavement, formwork as per IRC:43
is preferably
required over WBM/semi-rigid pavement to properly confine the concrete for adequate compaction by smooth wheel
roller (preferably vibratory roller).
(ii)
For the construction of roller compacted concrete pavement,
roller compacted concrete (RCC) can be either
laid on
compacted base course of WBM or dry lean concrete or any equivalent base course as per IRC:SP:49.
(iii)
Over the compacted DLC, a layer of roller compacted concrete (RCC) of thickness 22 cm shall be laid when maximum
axle load on the rural roads
is of 10.2 tonne.
The flexural strength of concrete shall not be less than 40 kg per sqcm.
Accordingly the minimum compressive strength of concrete may be approximately 350 kg/sqcm. The concrete shall be
preferably cured for 28 days from casting. The size of slabs is 5 m x 3.75 m with contraction joint at 5 m interval using hot
sealing compound. The joint may be provided with cut up to h/3 to h/4 in depth (width 6
to 8 mm) where h is the thickness
of RCC.
(iv)
All fine and coarse aggregate, cement and water,
if weigh batched (double bucket, swing type weigh batchers are now
easily and economically available in the market which are generally being used for larger projects) gives greater uniformity
in the quality of concrete. Ready mixed concrete, if available, may also be used. Due to non-availability of weigh batcher,
volume batching may also be allowed for the construction of rural roads, but with very good quality control.
(v)
Adequate compaction of zero slump concrete by suitable equipments is necessary. Every
1 per cent void remaining in the
concrete means a loss of strength of the order of 4 to 5 per cent.
(vi)
Surface water can be drained off to side drains by providing proper camber in the base course of 2 percent from centre line
towards the transverse direction.
(vii)
Longitudinal slope is essential to drain water along side drains. A minimum gradient specified in Chapter 2 are provided
m longitudinal direction.
(viii) All form works, finishing operation and curing shall be as per relevant standard specifications (IRC43 and IRC: 15).
(ix)
The K value on WBM
is between 10-14 kg/cucm, which
is also greater than the minimum K-value (taken as 5.54 kg/
cucm).
Therefore RCC may be laid directly over WBM or DLC or both combined in case of heavy loads or extremely
weak subgrade.
8.10.
Construction of Special Pavements
8.10.1.
Concrete block pavement (CBP)/interlocked concrete block pavement (ICBP)
: This type
of construction can be undertaken for road portion passing through
village. The provision of drainage at the
surface, sub-surface and sub-soil levels and preparation of the subgrade for Concrete Block Pavement (CBP)/
Interlocked Concrete Block Pavement (ICBP)
is the same as for normal road construction.
The compacted
subgrade shall provide a stable working platform for subsequent construction and shall be graded and trimmed
as per requirements. A good drainage layer shall be provided over the compacted subgrade. Base course shall
have minimum 100 mm compacted thickness. The surface evenness of the base course shall be within 10 mm
of the design profile. Bedding sand shall not be used as filler to correct base course profile. The base course
shall be extended on both sides of the pavement, at least just beyond the positions of the edge restraints. Edge
restraints shall be installed before preparation of bedding sand, and shall present a straight, vertical face to the
204

IRC:SP:20-2002
blocks After the construction ofbase course and installation of edge restraints, a typical construction sequence
to be adopted in construction of block pavement for maximum productivity is illustrated in Fig. 8 3. Bedding
sand shall be unloaded in small piles and regularly placed over the base course. Bedding sand shall preferably
have moisture content of about 6 per cent, which will facilitate its spreading and compaction.
Bedding sand
shall be screeded m a uniform layer over the base course. The screed can be guided to level by tensioned string
line set above the base course. At the time of screedmg, the thickness of sand must allow for the amount by
which it will be subsequently compacted.

IRC:SP:20-2002
The sand shall be distributed evenly with a small surcharge maintained in front of the screed. Screeding
shall not proceed beyond about
1 m ahead of the planned end of block paving for the day.
Sand shall be
compacted with a manual, fabricated plate compactor and the level shall be readjusted using the screed. The
surface profile of the screeded bedding sand shall match that required for the completed pavement.
The pattern in which blocks are to be paved shall be decided from the three main choices available,
namely herringbone, basketweave and stretcher patterns. A typical plan view of paving patterns is shown in
Fig. 8.4. By and large, these patterns are the same as adopted for brick paving, and shall be familiar to local
workers. For paving in trafficked areas, herringbone pattern shall be adopted for ensuring better performance.
Paving shall commence and progress from one starting line only. Wherever possible, paving shall commence
adjacent to or against edge restraint.

PAGE 236 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Blocks shall be placed at the correct angle to the start line to achieve the final orientation of the laying
pattern.
For curved or unfavourably oriented edge restraint, a string line shall be established to permit fast,
easy laying such that
it is never necessary to force a block between blocks already paved.
Maintenance of
control over alignment, laying pattern and joint width can be assisted by the use of chalked string lines set at
about 5 m intervals. Nominal joint width of 2 to 4 mm shall be maintained by holding the paving unit lightly
against the face of the adjacent block and allowing it to slide into position. Cutting paving units for filling the
paving gaps occurring against edge restraints etc. shall be deferred until sufficient work has progressed to
allow reasonably continuous operation. When space does not permit the use of cut pieces of blocks, the use of
premixed or dry packed concrete is recommended.
After a section has been paved, compaction with vibrating plate compactor is effected by the following
sequence of operations:
Vibrate the blocks with three passes of a standard vibrating plate compactor.
Spread a thin layer of fine sand on top of the paved blocks and sweep
it into the joints, using suitable brooms.
Vibrate the sand into the joints by making three passes of the compactor.
Sweep off the excess sand on top.
A standard vibrating plate compactor has a weight of 0.9 kN, a plate area of 0.3 sqm and is capable of
applying a centrifugal force of 15 kN. Use ofheavy-duty compactor is desirable for heavily trafficked pavements.
A typical heavy-duty plate compactor weighs between 3 to 6 kN, has a plate area of about 0.5 to 0.6 sqm and
is capable of applying a centrifugal force in the range of 20 to 30 kN. In the absence of a heavy compactor, the
number of passes by the light compactor may be suitably increased.
8.10.2. Construction of stone-sett pavement
: Regularly cut stone-sett pavements (typical
size:
150x150x300 mm) are laid in herringbone or stretcher bond pattern with the rows running either across or at
45° to the axis of the road.
Regularly cut stones help in maintaining narrow joint spacing. With good quality
stones joint widths of 10 mm or less can be achieved. For irregularly cut stones, the flat surface of the stones
should be tolerated.
While paving irregularly cut stones, joint widths
upto 20 mm may be tolerated. While
paving irregularly cut stones the flat surface of the stones should be facing the top.
Properly graded coarse
bedding sand should be used. The stones can also be set on a thick layer (50 mm) of hot sand bitumen mix. The
compacted thickness of bedding sand should be 40 mm. The stones are compacted into the bedding sand using
suitable compacting devices. The joint gaps are filled with fine sand, stone dust, or sand-cement mortar. Joints
can also be sealed with hot bitumen.
In case of application of mortar, moist curing for minimum one week has
to be ensured for obtaining maintenance free pavement.
Joint sealing can also be done with limestone dust
mixed with 30 to 40 per cent bitumen.
In case the stone-sett pavement is meant for trafficked areas, suitable
precautions in regard to selection of base course should be taken, so that damage due to water ingress
is
minimised.
The technique
is best suitable for areas with low and slow-moving traffic, where good quality
stones are locally available and craftsmen with knowledge of stone paving are available.
8.10.3.
Construction of brick-on-edge pavement
: Bnck-on-edge pavement is similar to stone-sett
pavement and is constructed over a thin layer of bedding sand. The compressive strength of bricks used for
paving should not be less than 7 MPa. Brick laying is suitable for very low traffic areas, for paving on shoulders
of pavements, local market areas, locations with difficult drainage, etc. For better performance, two layers can
be used.
Both layers should be paved in herringbone pattern with the flat sides of the bricks placed in the
vertical direction (brick on edge). The bricks are embedded by light compaction. The joint gaps are filled with
sand or hot bitumen.

8.11.
Equipment Required for Different Operations (Intermediate Technology)
Rural road construction and maintenance has been labour intensive in our Country.
So much so that
most of the time even a road roller has not been used for compaction on rural road works. It has to be recognised
that providing employment opportunities in rural areas is an important aspect of overall rural development. At
the same time compromising the engineering requirements would not be in the larger interest of the country, if
the objective of rural road development programme is restricted to only providing employment opportunities.
It is, therefore imperative to adopt an intermediate type of technology for rural road works. There has to be a
good combination between the purely manual methods and total mechanisation. The intermediate technologies
for various tasks/operations in rural road development works are outlined in Table 8.2 1
. However, effort should
be to use only the appropriate conventional equipments for each task.

Procedure for Field Preparation of Cut-Back Bitumen
Paving bitumen 80/ 1 00 is heated at
1 00°C to
1 1 0°C in a bitumen boiler. The required quantity of distillate
of specified type is taken in an empty drum. Hot bitumen from the boiler is added to the drum. After closing the
lid of the drum containing distillate and hot bitumen, it is rolled on the ground to and fro till a uniform blend is
obtained. The blend so prepared is transferred to a storage tank. Sufficient quantity of cut-back bitumen has to
be prepared before undertaking the road construction work. It may be ensured that the drum containing distillate
is kept at a safe distance from bitumen boiler equipment. Naptha, kerosene oil, heavy distillate and diesel oil
shall be used for preparation of rapid curing, medium curing, slow curing and primer type cut-back bitumen
respectively.

Appendix-8.5
Mixing, Transportation and Laying of Hot Mixed Bituminous Materials
Hot mixed bituminous materials shall be made with following methods and precautions:
(1)
Premixed bituminous materials which includes bituminous macadam, open graded premix carpet
and closely graded premix carpet shall be prepared in a hot mix plant of adequate capacity capable
of yielding a mix of uniform quality with respect to grading and binder content. The difference in
temperature of bitumen and aggregate shall not exceed 14°C. The temperature of binder shall not
exceed 175°C in any case.
(li) A batch type or continuous type or a spot mixer may be used for preparation of mix as decided by
Engineer-in-Charge.
If a continuous mixing plants
to be used for mixing, contractor must
demonstrated by laboratory analysis that cold feed combined grading is within permissible grading
limits and binder content is in compliance to job mix formula. The maximum permitted variations
in binder content of mix is 0.3 per cent.
(iii) The surface shall be cleaned of all loose and extraneous matter by a mechanical broom or any other
means like high-pressure air jet etc. Laying of bituminous mixture shall not be carried out when air
temperature is below 10°C or the wind blowing exceeding 40 km/hr.
(iv) Excluding the areas, where mechanical paver can not access, bituminous material shall be spread,
levelled and tamped by self propelled paver finisher. The rate of delivery of material to the paver
shall be regulated to enable paver to run continuously without any break in paving process. The
hand paving of premixed material shall be permitted in following circumstances.
Small laying area
Patch work and paving of footpaths
Locations where
it is impractical for a paver to operate
(v)
Compaction shall be completed before the temperature falls below the minimum specified rolling
temperature,
i.e.,
100°C. The
initial and breakdown rolling shall be done with 8-10 tonne dead
weight smooth wheeled rollers followed by intermediate rolling with the same roller or a vibratory
roller. The final rolling shall be done with a light roller smooth wheeled tandem roller. The roller
shall first compact materials adjacent to joints then lower to upper side of layer, over lapping on
successive passes by at least one third of the width of the rear roll.
In case of rolling in super
elevated and uni-directional camber, the rolling shall progress from lower to upper edge after the
edge has been rolled.
(vi) The minimum thickness of material laid in each paver pass shall be maintained in accordance with
minimum value given in the specifications. When laying of wearing course approaches an expansion
joint, machine laying shall be stopped 300 mm before start of the joint. The pavement area upto
joint and beyond it shall be hand paved.
(vii) During the period of construction, arrangements for traffic shall be made in accordance with provisions
of Clause
1 12 of the MoRT&H of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.

Appendix-8.
Mixing, Transportation and Laying of Cold Mixed Bituminous Materials
Cold mixed bituminous materials shall be made with following methods and precautions:
(1)
Premixing of cold mixed bituminous material can be undertaken in concrete mix plants as per
IS: 543 5 (Part-I). The mixing plant may be either batch or drum mix plant. On batch plant, the pug
mill mixing chamber should be vented to allow for steam to escape. The discharge end of the bitumen
emulsion circulating pipe should be kept below the surface of emulsion in storage tank to prevent
foaming. The temperature of emulsion should be above 30°C and will never reach above 100°C.
The manual mixing may be undertaken in case of small works in rare cases.
If a concrete mixer is used, 0.135 cum of aggregate per batch conforming to specifications shall be
used. First coarse aggregate shall be placed into mixer followed by required quality of cationic
bitumen emulsion, then fine aggregate and remaining quantity of emulsion. After material has been
mixed thoroughly,
it will be transported to the laying site in tippers. The cold premixed material
shall be spread within 10 minutes of applying tack coat and levelling and raking shall be completed
within 20 minutes. The mix shall be spread to desired thickness, grade and camber.
(li) The rolling shall start immediately after laying cold mixed material using smooth wheeled tandem
roller of
8-10 tonne as listed in Appendix-8.2. Vibratory rolling of open graded cold mix is not
recommended because fracture of aggregate and bitumen bond may occur. A light blotter of coarse
sand may be applied to permit rolling with a pneumatic tired roller. The blotting prevents pickup
and damage of surface by traffic.
The other precautions under cold mix construction are as under:
•
If rain occurs before the mix is cured, traffic should be kept off.
•
Water content should not be more than designed.
Over mixing should be avoided to prevent pre-mature breaking of emulsion. The reasonable mixing
time is one to two minutes.
Sealing of open graded surface should be done after a reasonable gap.

CHAPTER 9
USE OF WASTE MATERIALS
9.1.
Introduction
Conventionally road pavements are constructed using aggregates and binder. The usual binder adopted
in road works is bitumen. Aggregates form major portion of the total volume of pavement structure and is the
primary mineral material used in road construction. Large volumes of aggregates are consumed by the road
building programme and similar quantities are used in maintenance works. It is estimated that construction of
one cubic metre of Water Bound Macadam (WBM) involves use of about
1 .2 to
1 .4 cubic metre of aggregates,
and laying of bituminous pavements involve even higher quantities. The extraction of aggregates from natural
outcrop of rocks results into loss of forest lands, noise, dust, blasting vibrations, pollution hazards, etc. Such
environmental impacts are causing concern in many parts of the country. Unplanned exploitation of natural
rock mass may sometimes lead to landslides of weak and steep hill slopes.
In addition to aggregates and binder, enormous quantities of soil is also required for construction of road
embankments and approaches of bridges. Loss of precious topsoil in this process renders agricultural lands
infertile. R&D studies and successful field demonstration projects have proved that waste materials like fly ash,
iron and steel industry slags, municipal waste, rice husk ash, marble slurry dust, recycled concrete, etc. can be
used for construction of roads. While using such materials, the construction procedure would be broadly similar
to construction of roads using conventional materials
9.2.
Fly Ash for Road Construction
Due to industrialisation and rapid economic growth, demand for electricity has risen tremendously. To
meet this demand a number of coal based thermal power plants have been set up in the country. At present,
thermal power plants produce about 95 million tonnes of fly ash per annum. When pulverised coal is burnt in
the furnace of the power stations, about 80 per cent of the ash produced is very fine in nature. This part gets
carried along with flue gases and is collected by using either electro-static precipitator or cyclone precipitator.
The ash collected from such precipitators is called fly ash. The remaining ash sinters and falls down at the
bottom of the furnace. This is known as bottom ash. Fly ash may be disposed in dry form (in ash mounds) where
as the bottom ash is disposed through water slurry in a pond. When fly ash and bottom ash are mixed and
disposed in the form of water slurry to ash ponds, it is called pond ash. For the purpose of these guidelines the
term 'fly ash' generally denotes any type of coal ash unless specifically mentioned.
Fly ash is causing environmental pollution, creating health hazards and requires large areas of precious
land for disposal. Due to increasing concern for environmental protection and growing awareness of the
ill
effects of pollution, disposal of ash generated at thermal power plants has become an urgent and challenging
task.
The properties of fly ash depend upon type of coal, pulverisation and combustion techniques, collection
and disposal systems, etc. Ash collected from the same ash pond may exhibit different physical and engineering
properties depending on the point of collection, depth, etc. Obviously ash from two different thermal power
plants can be expected to have different properties. These factors can be easily taken care during characterisation,
design and quality control operations. Fly ash possesses several desirable characteristics such as lightweight,
ease of compaction, faster rate of consolidation, better drainage,
etc. In comparison to
soil, spreading and
compaction of fly ash can be started much earlier after a rainfall. For construction of embankments over weak
subsoil fly ash could be a preferred material. The present manual has been formulated to help executing agencies

to take up rural road works using fly ash. List of thermal power stations is placed in Appendix-9.1 and map
showing location of thermal power plants is given at Fig. 9.1
. Further, it may be noted that the Government of
India in a Gazette Notification dated 14.9.1999, has instructed all the thermal power stations to make ash
available for such purposes, free of cost for a period of ten years from the date of notification.

Design and Construction of Fly Ash Embankments
9.3.1.
Design considerations
: The design of fly ash embankments
is similar to design ot
soil
embankments. Fly ash embankments of height upto 3 m can be constructed adopting a side slope of 1:1.5
(V:H). A flatter slope of 1 :2 may be adopted at places where weak subsoil conditions exist or the embankment is
constructed in flood prone areas. Regardless of the height of the embankment, fly ash embankments should always
be constructed with soil cover. For construction of embankments of height more than 3 m, the design process for
embankments involves the following steps:
•
Site investigations
•
Characterisation of materials
•
Detailed design
In case of high embankment construction, the site investigations are carried out as per IRC:75. The
design of embankment is an iterative process. It involves developing conceptual plans, which satisfy site needs,
design requirements pertaining to slope stability, bearing capacity, settlement and drainage. The conceptual
designs are based on the engineering properties of fly ash and specific site conditions. The design includes
analysis for establishing structural features of the embankment at the selected site. Special emphasis is required
with respect to provision of earth cover for fly ash embankments. The thickness of earth cover on the side slope
would be typically in the range of
1 to 3 m which is governed by the height of the embankment and the side
slope. For embankment upto 3 m height, in general, the earth cover thickness ofabout 1 m (measured horizontally)
would be sufficient. The cover thickness may be increased for high embankments and embankments to be constructed
in flood prone areas. The side cover should be regarded as a part of embankment for design analysis.
The embankment would, therefore, be designed as a composite structure with
fly^ ash in the core and
earth cover on the sides. The software for stability analysis of high embankments available with the Indian
Roads Congress, approved by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H), Government of India, can
be used for design of fly ash embankments.
It is recommended that the factor of safety for embankments constructed using fly ash should not be less
than
1.25 under normal serviceability conditions and should not be less than
1.0 when checked for worst
combination under seismic and saturated conditions.
Intermediate soil layers are often provided in the fly ash, embankment of height more than 3 m, for ease
of construction, to facilitate compaction and to provide adequate confinement. Such layers also minimise
liquefaction potential. The compacted thickness of intermediate soil layer should not exceed 200 mm. One or
more intermediate layers can be provided depending upon the design requirements. The vertical distance between
such layers may vary from
1 .5 to 3 m. The top 0.5 m of embankment should be constructed using selected earth
to form the subgrade for the road pavement. Typical cross-sections of fly ash embankment with and without
intermediate soil layers are shown in Figs. 9.2 and 9.3 respectively.
9.3.2.
Materials for construction
: The physical and engineering properties of the materials to be
used in construction, fly ash and soil should be characterised to assess suitability of material and to obtain
design parameters.

Fly
ash
: The following information on the fly ash should be made available for engineer's
approval before commencement of compaction:
(i)
Particle size analysis of the material as per wet sieve analysis [IS:2720 (Part 4)-
1 985]
(ii)
The maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) as per modified proctor test, and the graph of
density plotted against moisture content [IS:2720 (Part 8 )-
1 983)]
Once the Engineer has approved the above information,
it shall form the basis for compaction. The
density of fly ash is in general considerably lower than density of soils. So, unlike soils, fly ash with low MDD
value should not be rejected for using it as a fill material.
To determine engineering properties of fly ash, tests should be carried out in accordance with the procedures
laid down in IS:2720 (Method of Tests for Soils-relevant parts).
Shear strength parameters,
for evaluation of the stability of proposed slopes and the bearing capacity of foundations
located on the fill.
Compressibility characteristics, for predicting the magnitude and duration of the fill settlement.
Permeability and capillary characteristics to assess seepage and to design drainage systems.

======================================================================
PAGE 255 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
The design analysis of an engineered fill or embankment requires the shear sucngth of fill material to be
determined. This
is accomplished in the laboratory by conducting triaxial shear or direct shear test. Shear
strength is affected by the density and moisture content of the specimen. To determine shear strength parameters
'c and (p\ laboratory shear strength tests should be conducted on samples compacted to densities equivalent to
those expected to be attained in the field. Fly ash gets consolidated at a faster rate and primary consolidation is
completed very quickly. So
it has low compressibility and shows negligible post construction settlements.
Liquefaction generally occurs when fly ash is deposited under loose saturated condition during construction.
There is very little possibility of liquefaction to occur, when fly ash is used in embankment construction, as the
material
is compacted to maximum dry density at optimum moisture content,
i.e., under partially saturated
condition. In regions ofmoderate to high seismic activity, analysis ofembankment stability should consider liquefaction
potential of the ash fill. To avoid the possibility of any liquefaction to occur, the following precautions may be taken:
•
Proper compaction of the fill material as per specifications
Lowering of high water table by providing suitable drains or capillary cutoff layer.
By sandwiching ash between intermediate horizontal soil layers
Typical values for different geotechnical properties of fly ash acceptable for embankment construction
are given m Table 9.1.

The chemical characteristics of fly ash, which need to be evaluated, are pozzolanic property, leachability
and self-hardening characteristics. The pozzolanic property of fly ash would be of importance if stabilisers like
lime are used. Self-hardening property of bituminous coal ashes
is insignificant. Fly ash to be used as
fill
material should not have soluble sulphate (expressed as S0
3 ) content exceeding 1.9 g per litre when tested
according to BS: 1377-1975 Test 10 but using a 2:1 water-soil ratio. Otherwise it shall not be deposited within
500 mm (or other distance prescribed by the engineer) of concrete, cement bound materials and other cementitious
material or metallic surface forming part of permanent works. Generally Indian fly ashes are found to be safer
on this parameter.
The primary environmental concern regarding use of fly ash for embankments would be contamination
of ground and surface water due to heavy metal leaching. But it may be noted that most fly ashes are relatively
inert. Moreover, coal used in Indian thermal power plants have high ash content. As a result, enrichment of
heavy metals is lower compared to fly ash produced by thermal power plants abroad. Studies have shown that
even though constituents in fly ash particle may dissolve initially but retention by weathered fly ash residues
reduces the possibility of their migration into ground water.
226

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
The leaching problem can be minimised by controlling the amount of water, which infiltrates into fly ash
embankment. Normally percolation of water into the fly ash core will be minimum when sides and top are
protected using good earth. Further by providing impervious wearing course to the pavement constructed over
the embankment seepage can be minimised. Side slopes should be properly benched and protected using soil
cover with vegetation or soil cover with stone pitching. Monitoring of fly ash embankments has indicated that
relatively little water tends to percolate through the complete embankment. Even in such a case, the alkaline
nature of the fly ash-water solution restricts heavy metal leaching.
9.3.2.2.
Earth cover
: The fly ash embankments should be covered on the sides and top by soil to
prevent erosion of fly ash. Good earth suitable for embankment construction can be adopted as cover material
for fly ash embankments. Gravel may be used to construct granular cut-off at the bottom. The soil used for
cover should have maximum dry density more than
1 .52 g/cc when height of embankment is upto 3 m and in
areas not subjected to extensive flooding, otherwise the maximum dry density of cover soil should not be less
than 1.60 g/cc when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983
. Subgrade/earthen shoulder material should
have minimum compacted dry density of 1.75 g/cc when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1 983. Plasticity
index of cover soil should be between 5 to 9 per cent when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 5)- 1985. Chemical
analysis or determination of deleterious constituents would be necessary in salt-mfested areas or when presence
of salts is suspected in the borrow material. Expansive soils should not be used for construction of cover, unless
it is properly stabilised using lime.
9.3.3.
Construction of fly ash embankments
9.3.3.1.
Clearing and grubbing
: This work consists of cutting, removing and disposal of trees, bushes,
shrubs, roots, grass, rubbish, etc., from the alignment and within the area of road land which will accommodate
road embankment, drains, and such other areas as specified on the drawings. During clearing and grubbing, the
contractor shall take adequate precautions against soil erosion, water pollution, etc. All trees, stumps,
etc.
falling within fill area should be cut to at least 500 mm below ground level and pits shall be filled with suitable
material and compacted thoroughly so as to make the surface at these points conform to the surrounding area.
9.3.3.2.
Stripping and storing of top soil
: When constructing embankment using fly ash, the top soil
from all areas to be covered by the embankment foundation should be stripped to specified depth not exceeding
150 mm and stored in stock piles of height not exceeding 2 m, for use in covering the fly ash embankment
slopes, cut slopes and other disturbed areas where re-vegetation is desired. Topsoil should not be unnecessarily
trafficked either before stripping or when in stockpiles. Also, these stockpiles shall not be surcharged or otherwise
loaded and multiple handling should be kept to minimum.
9.3.3.3.
Setting out
: After the site has been cleared, the limits of embankment should be set out true to
lines, curves, slopes, grades and sections as shown on the drawings of the project. The limits of the embankment
should be marked by fixing batter pegs on both sides at regular intervals as guides before commencing the
construction. The embankment should be
built
sufficiently wider than the design dimensions so that surplus
material may be trimmed, ensuring that the remaining material is of the desired density and in position specified,
and conforms to the specified slopes. Bench marks and other stakes should be maintained as long as they are
required for the work in the opinion of the engineer.
9.3.3.4.
Compacting the ground supporting embankment
: Where necessary, the original ground
should be levelled, scarified, mixed with water and then compacted by rolling so as to achieve minimum 97 per
cent ofMDD determined as per IS:2720 (Part 7) for the foundation soil. At locations where water table is high
and the soil has potential for rapid and relatively great migration of moisture by capillarity, a granular layer or
227



======================================================================
PAGE 257 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
impervious membrane (geomembrane) shall be laid so that moisture is not able to rise to the subgrade level.
Sand blanket of adequate thickness over full width of embankment can be adopted as an effective capillary cut
off. Medium grained sand can be used for this purpose. This will provide a working platform for the construction
of fly ash fill and function as capillary cut-off. Drainage blanket can be nominally compacted with or without
vibration. Bottom ash can also be used for construction ofdrainage blanket. Its gram size distribution is generally
compatible with the gram size distribution of medium grained sand.
9.3.3.5.
Handling fly ash
: Fly ash being a very fine material gets air borne easily and causes dust
nuisance
if not properly handled. Dust at a construction
site may be a safety hazard.
It may also lead to
environmental pollution, public resentment and damage to internal combustion engine of the construction
equipment besides being a health hazard to workers. To avoid this, fly ash from hoppers or silos must be
conditioned with water at power plant to prevent dusting enroute. Fly ash is typically delivered to the site in
covered dump truck to minimise loss of moisture and dusting. On the other hand, pond ash generally contains
enough moisture to prevent dusting, and may even contain excess moisture to create road spillage during
transport. In such cases, periodic inspections and lifting of ash from relatively dry areas of the pond would be
needed.
Fly ash may require on site temporary stockpiling if the rate at which the ash is supplied to the project
site is more than the contractors demand for an efficient rate ofplacement. Such cases should be avoided to the
extent possible, and in case stockpiling at site is inevitable, adequate precautions should be taken to prevent
dusting by spraying water on stockpiles at regular intervals. Otherwise, the surface of the fly ash stockpile may
be covered with tarpaulins or a thin layer of soil or other granular material not subject to dusting. Traffic
movements may be restricted to those areas which are kept moist, to prevent dispersing ash into air by tyres of
passing vehicles.
9.3.3.6.
Spreading and compaction
: The side soil cover, of required width shall be provided along
with the core and mechanically compacted as the embankment progresses upwards. The addition of side cover
subsequent to the construction of the core
is prohibited. The
fill material should preferably be spread by
mechanical means. Manual spreading may be permitted by the Engineer-in-Charge if the quantum of work is
less. The most efficient
lift thickness
is a function of roller weight and vibratory energy. Smaller vibratory
rollers with dead weights of 10 to 15 kN perform well on loose layer thickness of the order of 100-150 mm.
Medium weight vibratory rollers with dead weights in the range 60-100 kN, provide satisfactory compaction
for loose layer thickness of about 250 mm. When vibratory roller of dead weight 80-100 kN are used, loose
layer thickness upto 400 mm can be adopted if site trials show satisfactory compaction. When compaction is
carried out using only static roller of 80-100 kN weight, loose layer thickness shall not exceed 200 mm. The
cover soil and fly ash should be laid simultaneously before compaction, to ensure confinement of fly ash. Clods
in cover soil shall be broken to have a maximum size of 50 mm.
Moisture content of the fill material shall be checked at the site of placement prior to commencement of
compaction. Moisture content of fly ash laid for compaction shall normally vary from OMC (determined as per
IS:2720-1983 (Part 8) to OMC + 2 per cent. The moisture content limits can be varied by the Engineer-in-
Charge, depending on the weather conditions, provided specified compaction is achieved as revealed through
actual site trials. It may be noted that grain shape and particle size of fly ash make the upper layers difficult to
compact. At moisture contents higher than the appropriate range, fly ash may liquefy and would be difficult to
handle and compact. Moisture content of cover soil shall be maintained at its OMC. Where water is required to
be added to the fill material, it shall be sprinkled from a water tanker fitted with a sprinkler capable of applying
water uniformly without any flooding The water shall be mixed thoroughly by blading, discing or harrowing
228



======================================================================
PAGE 258 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
or by manual means until uniform moisture content is obtained throughout the depth of the layer. If the material
delivered to the construction site is too wet, it shall be dried by aeration and exposure to sun, till the moisture
content is acceptable for compaction.
Fly ash can be compacted using vibratory or static rollers. Regardless of the equipment used, fly ash
must be compacted as early as possible after spreading. The contractor shall demonstrate the efficacy of the
equipment he intends to use by carrying out compaction trials. The use of test strips to develop compaction
method specifications (optimum compaction procedure to satisfy density requirements) for the construction of
the embankment is advisable.
Each layer of fly ash shall be thoroughly compacted to the specified density. When vibratory roller is
adopted for compaction, two passes without vibration followed by 5 to 8 passes with vibration would be
sufficient to compact each layer.
The recommended mass per metre width of roller is 2300-2900 kg/m and
frequency range 1800-2200 rpm. The construction of fly ash core and earth cover on the sides should proceed
simultaneously. Each compacted layer shall be finished parallel to the final cross-section of the embankment.
The end product specifications as given in Table 9.2, are suggested for construction of fly ash embankments.
Table 9.2. Specifications for Compaction
Minimum dry density after compaction as percentage of MDD
IS:2720 (Part 7)-l 980.
97 per cent
Minimum dry density after compaction when used in bridge abutments
for embankment length equal to
1 .5 times the height of the embankment
1 00 per cent
Subsequent layers shall be placed only after the finished layer has been tested for its density requirements.
The contractor shall maintain record of all such tests. When density measurements reveal any soft areas in the
embankment, further compaction shall be carried out as directed by the engineer. In case the specified degree
of compaction is not achieved, the material in the soft areas shall be removed and replaced by approved material,
moisture content brought to permissible limits and recompacted to the required density. Embankment shall be
evenly constructed over full width and the contractor shall control and direct construction plant and other
vehicular traffic uniformly across the width. Damage by the construction plant or other vehicular traffic shall
be rectified by the contractor with material having the same characteristics and strength as before the damage.-
Embankments shall be constructed with side slopes conforming to the drawings. Whenever embankment
construction is to be taken up against the face of natural slope or sloping earthwork faces including embankments,
cuttings, and excavations, which are steeper than
1:4 (VerticakHonzontal), such faces shall be benched
immediately before placing the subsequent
fill. A less permeable capping layer of selected earth should be
constructed on the top of fly ash embankment, which would form the subgrade for the road pavement. The
thickness of this layer would normally be kept equal to 500 mm.
9.3.3.7.
Finishing operations
:
Finishing operations shall include the work of shaping and dressing
the shoulders/verges/roads beds and side slopes to conform to the alignment, levels, cross-sections and dimensions
shown on the drawing or as directed by the engineer subject to the tolerance. Both upper and lower ends of side
slopes shall be rounded off to improve appearance and to merge the embankment with the adjacent terrain. In
case turfing is proposed, topsoil should be provided so that after seeding, a dense cover can develop. The depth
of topsoil should be sufficient to sustain plant growth, the usual thickness being 75 to 100 mm. In order to
provide satisfactory bond, slopes shall be roughened and moistened slightly before the application of topsoil.
Embankments in flood prone areas should be protected by stone pitching.

9.3.4.
Quality control
: Quality of compacted material shall be controlled through periodic checks
on the compaction processor the end product, singly or in combination as directed.
The end product must
conform to the specifications.
9.3.4.1.
Control test on borrow material
: If fly ash from more than one source is being used at the
project site, monitoring must be done to identify the ash type being placed. The tests required to be conducted
on fly ash to be used as borrow material for embankment are indicated below. The frequency of testing indicated
refers to the minimum number of tests to be conducted. The rate of testing must be stepped up as found
necessary, depending on the compaction methods employed at the project.
Standard Proctor Compaction Test: At the rate of 2 tests per every 3000 m
3 of ash, as per IS:2720 (Part 7)-1980.
Moisture Content: One test for every 250 m
3 of ash, as per IS:2720 (Part 2)-l 973.
The samples collected for testing moisture content should be representative of the material being placed.
Because fly ash may air dry relatively rapidly, samples should not be taken from the surface of the
lift, but
should represent the overall moisture content.
9.3.4.2.
Analysis and acceptance of density results
: Field density of compacted ash should be checked
as per IS:2720 (Part 28)- 1974 or IS:2720 (Part 29)- 1972 or by using a nuclear density<gauge. Regardless of the
test procedure used, a sufficient number of tests must be conducted for the results to be representative. The
criteria for acceptance of results shall be same as detailed in Chapter 10.
9.4.
Lime Fly Stabilised Soil
A mixture of fly ash and soil, when stabilised using lime is called as 'Lime Fly Ash Stabilised Soil'. This
material can be used for constructing sub-base or base course of rural roads. The use of stabilised fly ash sub-
base/base course would be particularly attractive in locations where fly ash is easily available and supplies of
aggregates are unavailable or expensive. It is possible to construct lime fly ash stabilised layer without admixing
soil for sub-base layer. This would increase the utilisation of fly ash and also prevent usage of topsoil.
9.4.1.
Materials
9.4.1.1.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Typically, the supply of fly ash for a given construction project
is determined almost solely by the
proximity of the plant to the construction site. Withm a power plant, however, fly ash to be used for stabilisation
should preferably be obtained directly from hopper or silo where it is still relatively fresh and dry.
It would be
preferable to supply fly ash in bags.
In case bagging is not possible, fly ash should be conditioned with water
at power plants to prevent dusting during transportation. The conditioned ash when stockpiled at site should be
sprinkled with water at regular intervals and covered with tarpaulins or stored in a covered place.
If the' fly ash
had been stockpiled for some period before use and had got partially or wholly set,
it should be pulverised so
that minimum 98 per cent of it passes 600 micron sieve and minimum 30 per cent passes 75 micron sieve. Fly
ash may sometimes be obtained from multiple sources and often fly ash from a single source itself exhibits
variable properties. This requires that fly ash samples from all sources should be tested.
Ashes obtained from lagoons or ponds (pond ash) and bottom ash have reduced reactivity. Pond ash or
bottom ash, which do not meet the requirements as per Tables 9.3 and 9.4, can also be used for stabilisation
with lime. However in such cases a suitable percentage (usually varying from 1 5 to 25 per cent) ofclayey soil should
be mixed with pond ash or bottom ash so that, clay particles react with lime to produce cementitious compounds.
9.4.1.2. Lime
:
The lime to be used for lime fly ash soil stabilisation should be quick lime, which has
been pre-slaked at site,
it should be used within 7 days.
Slaked lime supplied in airtight bags should not be
stored for more than 3 months. Only hydrated high calcium and mono hydrated dolomite limes in powdered
form are used in lime fly ash soil stabilisation. Most of the commercially available hydrated limes are suitable
for lime fly ash soil stabilisation.
In addition, some by-product limes can also be used. Each source of lime
should be evaluated before approval. Generally, the lime used should have a purity (available lime content) of
not less than 70 per cent when tested according to IS: 15 14- 1990. High calcium content varieties of lime give
higher strengths even when used in small quantities.
In exceptional circumstances, if lime with minimum 70
per cent purity is not available, the difference may be accounted for by providing proportionately higher quantity
of lime.
Since lime deteriorates with storage the purity must be checked at site before use and the required
quantity of lime be added should be regulated accordingly. Lime when stored should be kept in airtight bags to
prevent its carbonation and deterioration from any other cause. Besides the primary reaction between lime and
fly ash, lime may also react chemically with the fines in the mixture resulting in base exchange, flocculation
and aggregation of particles. The magnitude of this reaction depends on degree of fineness of clay component
and mineralogical characteristics.
9.4.2.
Soil
:
Granular soils, free from high concentrations of organic matter or deleterious salts and
sandy soils with fine silts, are better suited for lime stabilisation. Normally, soils with plasticity index between
4 and 20 are suitable.
This technique may also be applied to soils with plasticity index value more than 20,
provided strength tests on lime fly ash soil mixes, show favourable results. The ideal proportion ofparticles smaller
than 425-micron sieve size would be between 15 and 25 per cent by dry weight of the soil-lime-fly ash mixture.
9.4.3.
Water
: Water used for mixing and curing should be clean and free from injurious
salts,
organic substances and other deleterious matter. Potable water
is generally considered satisfactory.
The
permissible limits for solids in water should be as given in Chapter 4.
9.4.4.
Mix
proportion
: The mix proportions of fly ash and lime should meet the following
requirements:
•
Provide adequate strength and durability
•
Be easily placed and compacted
•
Be economical
231

IRC:SP:20-2002
To increase utilisation of fly ash, adequate attention should be paid to stabilise fly ash using lime alone
and avoiding soil admixture. The mix shall be designed to make optimal use of fly ash. Amount of lime less
than 2 per cent (by weight of lime + fly ash + soil) is not generally amenable to proper mixing and hence not
recommended. Lime fly ash mixes develop strength at a slow rate. After deciding lime and fly ash content for
trial mix, moisture density relationship should be determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 7)- 1983. The
unconfmed compressive strength testing is done on samples compacted at maximum dry density and optimum
moisture content. The mix proportion should be designed to obtain minimum unconfined compressive strength
of 1.5 MPa after 28 days moist curing in a humidity chamber, for samples with a length to diameter ratio of 2:1.
Curing may be carried out in the temperature range 30 to 38°C. The specimens should be compacted at optimum
moisture content to maximum dry density for the soil-fly ash lime mix determined as per Standard Proctor
Compaction IS:2720 (Part 7)-1983. In high rainfall areas, the mix should be designed for a minimum unconfined
compressive strength of 0.75 MPa after 28 days moist curing in a humid chamber and 4 days soaking in water.
The design mix should not only indicate the proportions of fly ash and stabilisers, but also mention
quantity of water in the mix and a specified compacted density that is required to satisfy specified strength.
When fly ash from more than one source is adopted, less reactive fly ash sample should be
selected for design
trial mixes.
If the design is economically unacceptable or if it exceeds double the compressive strength of the
weak mix, considerations must be given to eliminate the source of fly ash requiring highest
stabiliser
content.
9.4.3.
Construction Operations
9.4.3.1.
Preparation of subgrade
: The subgrade over which the lime fly ash soil layer is to be laid
should be shaped to the desired crown and checked for line, grade and cross-section.
All irregularities beyond
the permitted tolerance should be corrected. The road bed shall be prepared by light sprinkling with water to
prevent absorption of moisture from the base course and rolled with 80-100 kN static weight smooth wheeled
roller.
Soft and yielding spots, ruts etc. if present should be rectified and backfilled with suitable material and
rolled until firm.
9.4.3.2.
Weather limitations
: Lime fly ash soil stabilisation should not be done when air temperature
in the shade is less than 10°C.
9.4.3.3.
Mixing and laying
: Lime and fly ash should preferably be mixed by weigh batching. Volume
batching should be adopted only when unavoidable. Thorough mixing of fly ash and other materials is extremely
important to obtain a blend that provides a uniform strength and durability for the pavement.
Since
soil
stabilisation is generally done m-situ, mix-in-place techniques are more economical than central mixing.
In
mix-m-place methods, the spreading and mixing are typically sequenced operations where the lime fly ash mix
is uniformly distributed over the surface and then blended. The mix-in-place method requires distribution of
fly ash and lime evenly over the work area, subsequent addition of moisture and mixing with a travelling
mixing plant. Manual mixing and laying can also be adopted in case Engineer-m-Charge permits the same. Soil
should be free from all vegetation and other deleterious matter and pulverised to conform the requirement as
given in Table 9.5.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Soil shall then be spread uniformly on the prepared roadbed. The thickness ofuncompacted layer required
is about 25-35 per cent more than the specified thickness determined through field trials. Lime and fly ash shall
be spread ahead of mixing, taking care to.prevent dusting. Tractor towed rotavator developed at CRRI or any
other similar equipment can be used for mixing. Mechanical method of mixing is found to be more convenient
for achieving consistency than manual mixing. Mixing should be continued with successive passes until the
required depth and uniformity of mixing has been obtained.
This moisture content (OMC+2 per cent)
is specified to compensate for the loss of moisture during
spreading operations, moisture content of the construction mix.
If it is necessary to adjust the moisture content
of the mix, water is added uniformly and in a controlled using a sprayer. Where manual mixing is adopted, soil
free from organic matter is scarified or brought from the identified borrow areas and pulverised using crow
bars, pickaxes, etc., to meet the specifications given in Table 9.5. Water in requisite quantities may be sprinkled
on soil to aid pulverisation. On the pulverised soil, lime and fly ash shall be spread uniformly and mixed
thoroughly by working with spades or other implements to get a uniform mix.
After adjusting the moisture
content to be within the limits specified, the mixed material shall be spread upto required thickness.
The thickness of individual compacted layer should not be less than 0. 1 m or more than 0.2 m. Thickness
greater than 0.2 m shall be constructed in multiple layers. Before laying the second layer, compacted first layer
shall be roughened to ensure proper bond between the layers. The width of lime fly ash base/sub-base should
extend 0.3 m more than the width of the top layer on it.
9.4.3.4.
Rolling
: Immediately after spreading, grading and levelling of the mixed material, compaction
should be carried out with 80-100 kN static weight smooth wheel rollers or other roller approved by engineer.
Rolling shall begin at edges and progress towards centre in straight road portion. Compaction shall continue
until the density achieved is at least 100 per cent of the maximum dry density of the material, as per Standard
Proctor Compaction IS:2720 (Part 7)-l 980. The suitability of a particular compaction equipment and number
of passes required may be verified on a test strip.
Ideally not more than 60 minutes should elapse between the
start of moist mixing and start of compaction process. Care should be taken to see that compaction is completed
within three hours of mixing or such shorter period as may be necessary during dry weather.
9.4.3.5.
Curing
: Curing period, temperature and moisture maintained during the process of curing are
important factors for the development of strength. Either of the following two curing methods may be adopted.
Bituminous curing
: A rapid curing seal coat such as a cut back or emulsion may be applied at the rate
of 0.7 to 1.4 1/m
2 in case of scarcity of water for moistening. The
sealant or curing material should be applied
within 30 minutes of the completion of finishing operations and after the surface of the stabilised course has
been broomed free of all loose and foreign material and sufficient water has been applied to wet the surface.
Additional layers such as base or wearing course can be constructed soon thereafter.
Moist curing
:
Curing of the compacted layer can also be done by spreading moist straw or sand and
sprinkling water periodically. Curing shall be carried out for a minimum period of 7 days after which subsequent
pavement layers shall be laid to prevent the surface from drying out. No traffic shall be allowed to ply during
the curing period, unless permitted by the engineer. Curing by ponding of water is not permitted to avoid
leaching of lime.
9.4.3.6.
Construction joint
: At the end of day's work, a transverse construction joint for full depth
should be made by chamfering at an angle of 30°.
9.4.4.
Quality control
: For satisfactory performance of lime fly ash
soil stabilised layer,
strict
quality control measures are essential.
It is prudent to conduct periodic testing during construction to confirm
233



======================================================================
PAGE 263 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
that the properties of fly ash being used are within the range of values anticipated during the design. For each
consignment of lime and fly ash, testing should be done to check purity.
In case of lime, available lime
(calcium oxide) content should be determined according to IS: 1 727-1967, which should not be less than 70 per
cent.
Quality control tests and their minimum desirable frequency are as given in Table 9.6.
Strict control
should be exercised during the mix-in-place operations, with frequent checks on mixing efficiency.
This can
be done by trenching through the in-place material and inspecting the colour of the mixture. Unmixed streaks
or layers indicate poor mixing, and the material in that area should be remixed until uniformity of colour is
achieved. The camber, grade and thickness should be checked as outlined in Chapter 10.

Lime Fly Ash Bound Macadam (LFBM)
In conventional Water Bound Macadam (WBM) non-plastic or low-plasticity materials with screenings
are used as
filler for stone metal.
When WBM
is used in the upper layers of the road pavement or thin
bituminous surface dressing or premix carpet is adopted as wearing course, it permits penetration of water into
WBM.
The filler being a material having very
little binding property, WBM gets markedly softened upon
being wetted. As a result, potholes are formed in the pavement under traffic, which are enlarged subsequently.
On the other hand, filler made of a mixture of lime, fly ash and moorum in suitable proportions improves the
performance as it has cementitious properties and does not soften in presence of water. Load bearing capacity
of lime fly ash bound macadam (LFBM) will be superior to that of conventional WBM. WBM constructed
with lime-fly ash-moorum as
filler would have longer life and better serviceability in the areas of heavy
rainfall (annual rains fall greater than 1000 mm).
9.5.1.
Materials
9.5.1.1.
Coarse aggregates
: Coarse aggregates shall be either crushed or broken stone, naturally
occurring aggregates such as kankar or laterite of good quality. Kankar shall be tough, having a blue almost
opalescent fracture.
It shall not contain any clay in the cavities.
Laterite shall be hard, compact, heavy and of
dark colour. The coarse aggregates shall conform to strength requirements as given in Chapter 4. The aggregates
should be free from deleterious organic or chemical substances that may interfere with the chemical reaction.
Coarse aggregates shall conform to one of the grading given in Chapter 4.
9.5.1.2.
Filler
: The filler used shall be a mixture of fly ash, lime and moorum. Instead of moorum,
sand or soil may also be used. Soil/moorum used as filler shall have plasticity index between 4 to 6. The fly ash
should be collected dry from hopper or silos and conform to requirements of the Section 9.4.1.1, Lime to be
234



======================================================================
PAGE 264 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
used should conform to the requirements of the Section 9.4. 1 .2. The typical proportion of dry lime, fly ash and
moorum or sand or soil can be 1:2:9 (by weight).
9.5.1.3.
Screenings
: The grading of screenings shall be within the limits given in Table 4.10, Chapter
4.
9.5.2.
Construction procedure
9.5.2.1.
Preparation of foundation for laying LFBM
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.1 shall apply
when LFBM course is being laid on soil subgrade. When LFBM is to be laid on an existing unsurfaced road,
the surface shall be scarified and reshaped to the required grade and camber as necessary. Weak places shall be
strengthened, corrugations removed and depressions/potholes filled with suitable materials before spreading
the coarse aggregates for LFBM. In case of black topped roads, the existing black top shall be removed, before
laying LFBM. In all cases, the foundation shall be kept well drained during the construction operations.
9.5.2.2.
Weather limitations
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.2 shall apply.
9.5.23.
Provision of lateral confinement to aggregates
: Before starting with LFBM construction,
necessary arrangements shall be made for the lateral confinement of aggregates. One method is to construct
side shoulders in advance to a thickness corresponding to the compacted thickness of the LFBM course. After
shoulders are ready, their inside edges may be trimmed vertical and the included area cleaned of all spilled
material, thereby, setting the stage for spreading of coarse aggregates. In the second method, side supporters
are to be provided during construction operations to confine the LFBM.
9.5.2.4.
Spreading coarse aggregates
: The coarse aggregates shall be spread uniformly and evenly
upon the prepared base in the required quantities from stockpiles or along the side of the road or directly from
the vehicle.
In no case these shall be dumped in heaps directly on the area where LFBM is to be laid. They
shall be spread to proper profile by using templates placed across the road about 6 m apart. No segregation of
large and fine particles shall be allowed. The coarse aggregates, as spread, shall be of specified gradation with
no pockets of fine materials. The coarse aggregate shall not be normally spread in lengths exceeding the three
days average work.
9.5.2.5.
Rolling
: After laying the coarse aggregates, they shall be compacted to full width by rolling
with either smooth wheeled static roller of 80 to 100 kN capacity or an equivalent vibratory roller. The rolling
shall begin from the edge so that edge portion is firmly compacted. The roller shall then progress gradually
from edges to the centre, parallel to the centre line of the road and overlapping uniformly each preceding rear
wheel track by one half width and shall continue until the entire area of the course has been rolled by the rear
wheel. Rolling shall continue until the road metal is thoroughly keyed and creeping of the stone metal ahead of
the roller is no longer visible. Slight sprinkling of water may be done, if required. On superelevated portions of
the road, rolling shall begin from the lower edge and progress gradually towards the upper edge of the pavement.
Rolling shall not be done when subgrade is soft to yielding or when it causes a wavy motion in the base course
or subgrade. If irregularities, which exceed 12 mm (when tested using a 3 m straight edge), develop during
rolling, the surface shall be loosened and aggregates added or removed as required, before rolling again to
achieve a uniform surface conforming to the desired cross-section and grade. The surface shall also be checked
transversely by template for camber, and irregularities, if any, are corrected in the manner described above. In
no case, the use of screenings shall be permitted to make up depressions.
9.5.2.6.
Application of screening material
: After the coarse aggregates have been compacted,
screening material shall be applied gradually over the surface. The screenings shall be applied at a slow and
uniform rate so as to ensure filling of all voids. This shall be accompanied by dry rolling and brooming. After
235



======================================================================
PAGE 265 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
the screenings have been applied, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, swept and rolled.
9.5.2.7.
Application of filler material
: After coarse aggregates have been rolled, filler shall be applied
gradually over the surface to fill the interstices. The filler material has to be prepared by proper blending of the
dry constituent materials, namely lime, fly ash and sand or moorum or soil in suitable proportions just before
use. The required amount of filler material is spread uniformly over the stone metal surface. Enough quantity
of water is then added while rolling so that the slurry penetrates into voids taking care that the water used is not
as profuse as in normal WBM.
9.5.2.8.
Setting and drying
: After final compaction of the layer, the LFBM layer shall be allowed to
cure for 7 days (moist). Hungry spots shall be filled with screenings or binding material, lightly sprinkled with
water if necessary, and rolled. Only light motor vehicles should be allowed during the curing period. In case the
LFBM course
is to be provided with bituminous surfacing, the latter course shall be laid only after LFBM
course is completely dried after curing and before allowing any traffic.
9.5.2.9.
Plying of construction traffic
: In general construction traffic may ply over completed portion
ofLFBM course provided vehicles move over its full width avoiding any rutting or uneven compaction. However,
the Engmeer-in-Charge shall have full authority to stop the passage of traffic when in his opinion this is leading
to excessive damage.
9.5.3.
Quality control
: The surface evenness of completed LFBM course in longitudinal and
transverse directions, measured with a 3 m straight edge shall be within the tolerance indicated below:
9.53.1.
Grading I
Maximum permissible undulations in longitudinal profile-
1 5 mm.
Maximum number of undulations exceeding
1 2 mm permitted in any 300 m stretch-30.
Maximum permissible variation from specified profile under a camber template- 12 mm.

Maximum permissible undulations in longitudinal profile-12 mm.
Maximum number of undulations exceeding
1 0 mm permitted in any 300 m stretch - 30.
Maximum permissible variation from specified profile under a camber template - 8 mm.
The longitudinal profile shall be checked at the middle of each traffic lane along a line parallel to the
centre line of the road. The transverse profile shall be checked with a series of three camber boards at intervals
of 10 m.
Quality control tests on materials shall be carried out according to Table 9.7.

Lime Fly Ash Concrete
Lime
fly ash concrete
is resistant to softening under water action and can serve as a good
working platform on soft foundations. Hence,
a lesser thickness of this material can replace water
bound macadam layer.
It
is particularly suitable for heavy rainfall regions, black cotton
soil areas and
places where good quality aggregates are not easily available. The stiff lime fly ash concrete layers distribute
the load over large areas of subgrade, by slab action, reducing the low vertical stresses transmitted to the
subgrade.
9.6.1.
Materials
9.6.1.1.
Lime
: Lime to be used, storage and handling shall comply with Section 9.4.1.2.
9.6.1.2.
Fly ash
: Fly ash to be used, supply and storage shall conform to section 9.4. 1.1. The moisture
content of conditioned fly ash should be determined and accounted for while preparing the lime fly ash
concrete mix.
9.6.13.
Aggregates
:
The aggregate may be either stone, gravel, slag or brickbats, crushed or
uncrushed, or any combination thereof. Coarse aggregates may be either conforming to IS:383-1970 (natural
stone aggregates) or broken bricks conforming lo IS:3068-1986. The maximum size of aggregate normally
used is 40 mm. Chances of segregation increases, ifmaximum size of aggregate exceeds 20 mm. A wide range
of aggregate gradation is permitted.
Coarse and fine aggregates should be combined in such a way that
it
should meet any one of the gradation limits given in Table 9.8, and aggregates should be selected in such a way
that, the lime fly ash concrete should give a minimum compressive strength of 4.0 MPa at 28 days in the field.
In addition to the fine aggregates, supplementary fly ash may be used as a mineral filler to provide desired fines
content. The portion of the aggregate material passing 425 microns shall have a liquid limit less than 25 and
plasticity index less than 6. Aggregates are typically stored in piles according to gradation and the area must be
free draining and also free from deleterious matter.

Water
: Water used for lime fly ash concrete works should conform Section 9.4. 1 .4.
9.6.2.
Proportioning of lime fly ash concrete
: To act as a semi-rigid pavement layer, lime fly ash
concrete should be designed with zero slump, as compaction in the field is done by rollers. The mix proportions
are designed by trial and error method. As a rough guide, to achieve 28 days compressive strength of 4.0 to 6.0
MPa, the approximate total aggregate/binder (lime+fly ash) ratio would be between 2.5 and 3.5 (by weight)
with about 10-11 per cent of water content by weight of dry material when crushed stone is used as coarse
aggregate.
Generally, the lime fly ash content of a mixture ranges from 10 to 30 per cent, with lime to fly ash

4.0-5.0 MPa, lime of 60 per cent purity, good quality crushed stones (20 mm nominal size) and medium coarse
sand are presented in Table 9.9. While selecting the trial mix, allowance should be made for type of aggregate,
quality of fly ash, maximum size of aggregate,
etc.
For ensuring 28 days field strength of 4.0-6.0 MPa,
laboratory mix should be designed at least 1.25 times the required field strength.

Construction
9.63.1.
Preparation of subgrade
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.1 shall apply.
9.63.2.
Weather limitations
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.2 shall apply.
9.6.33.
Batching and mixing of materials
: Thorough mixing is extremely important so that a blend
that provides uniform strength and durability
is obtained. Mixing
is usually done with batch type concrete
mixers or pug mill mixers. A permanent mixing plant may be set-up at a suitable location or smaller capacity
units can also be brought on site.
Accurately controlled amounts of fly ash and other ingredients are fed into
the mixing chamber where they are mixed until uniform composition is obtained. The batch should be calibrated
by weight and volume batching may be permitted only in exceptional cases.
Proportioning of constituent
materials should be as specified on the basis ofdesignated mix, making due allowance for free moisture absorption
in aggregate and moisture present in lime and fly ash.
It has been found that moist fly ash facilitates easier
mixing to obtain desired compaction.
The mixer should not be overloaded and adequate mixing time (1-2
minutes) should be given to ensure uniform mixing. The volume of the material in the mixer shall not be more
than 60 per cent of the space inside the mixer.
9.63.4.
Transportation and placement of lime fly ash concrete
: The lime fly ash concrete should
be transported and placed on the prepared subgrade so that the compacted layer would have the required
thickness, slope and camber.
In case central mixing is adopted, the mix is hauled to the construction site in
covered trucks to minimise evaporation losses. Spreading should result in a uniform, uncompacted layer, which
will achieve the compacted thickness required as per specifications. The thickness of uncompacted layer required
is about 20-25 per cent more than the specified thickness. The actual thickness of uncompacted layer required
may be determined through field trials. Transportation and placement should be done in such a way, so as to
avoid segregation. Any portion of the batch that becomes segregated during placing, should be thoroughly
mixed with fresh concrete before spreading. The layer of lime fly ash concrete should be laid to specified grade
and camber before commencing rolling operations. Spreading should progress in such a way, so that not more
than 30 minutes elapse between adjacent passes. A construction joint should be formed along the edge of the
previous pass if more than 30 minutes elapse between adjacent passes.
9.63.5.
Compaction
: When sufficient length of lime fly ash concrete has been laid to permit rolling,
compaction should be started. Compaction in the field should be done by means of 80- 1 00 kN smooth wheeled
roller, when crushed stone aggregate are used and 60-80 kN roller when soft aggregates like brick-bats, cinder
238

IRC:SP:20-2002
are used.
Alternatively, vibratory roller of equivalent capacity can also be used. Rolling should start from the
outer edge of the pavement and continue towards the middle except at superelevated portions where
it should
begin at lower edge of the pavement and progress towards the higher. Adequate number of passes should be
given to ensure full compaction. While using heavy vibratory roller, care should be taken not to overstress the
surface. Generally four to eight passes are necessary to achieve the desired compaction. The grade and camber
of surface should be checked during compaction and all irregularities should be corrected by removing or
adding fresh materials.
Ideally, not more than 60 minutes should elapse between the start of moist mixing (on
site or off site) and start of compaction. Compaction should be completed within specified period, which shall
not exceed 4 hours after mixing. When lime fly ash concrete is to be laid in two layers, the second layer should
be laid within 2-3 hours after compaction of the lower layer.
9.63.6.
Joints
: No joint need to be provided except construction joint at the end of day's work and
each successive length taken up for rolling. Construction joints should be formed by chamfering the edge of
already laid concrete at an angle of about 30° and subsequently
laying the fresh concrete thereon.
9.63.7.
Curing
: After laying and compaction of the total thickness of lime fly ash concrete has been
completed, it should be cured for the first 48 hours by covering it with wet gunny bags or Hessian, subsequently
by spreading wet sand or watering frequently in moderate quantities. Curing should not be done by ponding as
that would lead to leaching of lime.
Curing should be carried out for at least 7 days and preferably 14 days
depending on seasonal and other considerations. No traffic should be allowed on the lime fly ash concrete
layer before top courses are placed thereon.
9.63.8.
Rectification of surface irregularities
: The finished surface should be checked for line,
level, camber, grade and surface finish as per Chapter 10 and irregularities should be corrected.
9.6.4.
Quality control

Roller Compacted Fly Ash Concrete Pavement
Roller compacted fly ash concrete (RCFC) is a zero-slump Portland cement concrete which is compacted
using a road roller. Fly ash is an additive for roller compacted concrete, and it is strongly recommended that fly
ash should be used as an ingredient in all works involving RCFC.

======================================================================
PAGE 269 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
9.7.1.
Materials
: The contractor shall indicate to the engineer the source of all materials to be used
in RCFC work with relevant test data. Approval of the Engineer for the same shall be obtained sufficiently in
advance and sufficient quantity of materials should be stockpiled before commencement of the work. Uniformity
of the materials over the duration of the project is critical to the performance of RCFC pavement.
9.7.1.1.
Cement
: Cement conforming to IS:269-1989 or IS:81 12-1989 can be used. Portland pozzolana
cement should not be used for making RCFC when fly ash is used as an ingredient.
9.7.1.2.
Aggregates
:
Coarse and fine aggregate for RCFC shall conform to Chapter 4.
9.7.13.
Fly ash
: Fly ash to be used for RCFC work may be either from anthracitic coal or lignite. Fly
ash to be used for RCFC work shall conform to the requirements given in Tables 9.3 and 9.1 1.

Fly ash should be obtained directly from hopper or silo where it is still relatively fresh and dry. Fly ash
may be obtained in bulk or in bags.
In case bagging is not possible, fly ash must be conditioned with water at
the power plant. The conditioned ash when stockpiled at site should be sprinkled with water at regular intervals
and covered with tarpaulins during its storage. Ash obtained from lagoons or ponds (pond ash) and bottom ash
have reduced reactivity, and should not be used for RCFC work.
9.7.1.4.
Water
: Water used for mixing and curing of roller compacted concrete shall be clean and free
from injurious amounts of oils, salts, acid, etc.
It shall meet the requirements as per IS:456-2000.
Potable
water is generally considered to be acceptable for RCFC work. The permissible limits for solids in water should
be as per Chapter 4.
9.7.2.
Mix design for roller compacted fly ash concrete
: The mix design shall be based on flexural
strength. Flexural strength achieved for roller compacted fly ash concrete (RCFC) usually exceeds those for
conventional concrete with similar cement contents. Flexural strengths up to 4.5 MPa can be achieved.
Initial
rate of strength gam ofRCFC may be slower when compared to the same mix of plain cement concrete without
fly ash.
Consequently, designs based on more than 28 days strengths would be appropriate depending on the
available lead time prior to opening to traffic. While designing the mix in the laboratory, correlation between
flexural and compressive strengths of concrete shall be established on the basis of tests on samples for use at a
later date to verify the in-situ flexural strength ofRCFC through testing on cores. Considering the variations in
the field, the laboratory mix should be designed for
at least 1.25 times the required 28 days field strength as
per IRC:44.
Proportions in an RCFC mix generally comprise 81-84 per cent aggregates, 12-14 per cent cementitious
binder and 4-6 per cent water by weight. The maximum aggregate to cement ratio of the mix should be 15:1.
The minimum cement content in RCFC shall not be less than
1 50 kg/m
3 of concrete. When RCFC is used in the
wearing course, minimum cement content should be 250 kg/m
3 of concrete. Due to low water content of
RCFC, amount of fines required is more than normal concrete. This helps to reduce segregation. The fines are
240



======================================================================
PAGE 270 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
typically supplied by fly ash. An additional benefit is gained from the pozzolanic property of fly ash, which
contributes to strength ofRCFC. Generally, the fly ash content in RCFC pavements has been upto 35 per
of total cementitious ingredients, with typical contents being about 25-30 per cent. When 43 grade cement is
used the percentage of fly ash replacement can be increased, after investigating the strength properties in the
laboratory.
The concrete used in RCFC work would be usually having zero slump.
Modified Proctor compaction
test can be used for determining the optimum moisture content for compaction. This test would also indicate
maximum achievable density of the mixture, against which field densities can be compared. The right amount
of water for the RCFC pavement work shall be decided for ensuring full compaction. Excess water will cause
the concrete to heave in front of the roller wheels resulting in uneven compacted surface while too little water
will lead to inadequate compaction, low in-situ strength and an open textured surface.
The optimum water
content, as determined in laboratory trials shall be adjusted during construction at field by trial rolling a small
stretch. The variations in water content in the mix shall be +
1 per cent from the specified value.
9.7.3.
Construction
: The laying programme ofroller compacted concrete shall match with the laying
of base/sub-base course. In case base course of dry lean fly ash concrete is to be laid as per specifications,
RCFC shall be over laid after 10 days but within 30 days of laying dry lean fly ash concrete sub-base/base.
9.73.1.
Preparation of subgrade/sub-hase
: The subgrade or sub-base over which RCFC is to be laid
shall conform to grades and cross-sections as per drawings and uniformly compacted to the designed strength
as per stipulations in the contract. The checking and rectification of the underlying layer should be done at
least 2 days before laying RCFC. The subgrade shall not be softened by rain water, shall be devoid of surface
trenches and soft spots.
Soft spots if any shall be filled and compacted to maximum dry density. To prevent
absorption of water from RCFC, the underlying layer should either be covered with water proof paper/plastic
sheets or sprinkled with water 2-3 huurs before laying the RCFC layer.
It would be preferable to provide
compacted granular sub-base course of 1 00- 1 50 mm, below RCFC layer rather than laying RCFC directly over
subgrade.
9.73.2.
Batching and mixing
: The batching plant shall be capable of proportioning the materials by
weight. Each type of material shall be weighed. Volume batching may be permitted only when unavoidable,
Due allowances for moisture present in aggregates and fly ash should be made. The accuracy of weighing shall
be within + 2 per cent by weight in case of aggregates and +
1 per cent by weight in case of binder and water.
Production of RCFC may be carried out using mobile continuous mixing plants, which are called pug mills.
Other types of power driven mixers may be permitted subject to demonstration of its satisfactory performance
during field trials. Due to relatively low amount of cement and water, thorough mixing is critical to obtain the
full strength of the material. The mixer should not be over loaded and adequate mixing time (minimum 1.5
minutes) should be allowed to ensure proper mixing.
9.733.
Transportation
: The plant mix concrete, discharged from the mixer, shall be immediately
transported directly to the point where
it is to be laid.
Haulage of RCFC from the production plant can be
carried out using tipping trucks or manually if quantities are less. During its transit, concrete shall be protected
by covering it with tarpaulin on the top surface. Segregation of concrete should be controlled. RCFC should be
placed as soon as possible after mixing. Travel time between the mixing plant and the paver should be limited
to 15 minutes.
In case the distance of laying is more than 10 to 12 km from the plant, concrete would get
compacted in the tipper beds resulting in difficulties in unloading. Provision of form vibrators, locally attached
to the tipper hoppers, would help in unloading concrete under such conditions.

PAGE 271 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
9.7.3.4.
Placing
: Concrete shall be placed uniformly over the sub-base stretch avoiding segregation.
RCFC can be laid using a paver having vibrating screed. Manual laying may also be resorted to subject to the
approval by Engmeer-in-Charge.
9.73.5.
Compaction
:
Compaction shall be carried out immediately after the material
is laid and
levelled over sub-base. Smooth wheeled vibratory rollers ofminimum 80 to 100 kN static weight are considered
to be suitable for compacting zero slump concrete.
Initially 2 or 3 passes are made without vibration, followed
by about 6 to 8 passes of roller in vibrating mode.
Final rolling should be performed with a smooth wheeled
static roller.
During the period when roller is changing direction or when roller is about to stop, vibration
should be switched off.
Roller speeds should be limited to 2.5 kmph.
The minimum dry density of RCFC pavement shall be 97 per cent of that achieved during trial length
construction/laboratory testing. Edge region i.e., upto 0.5 m from the edge cannot be compacted to the same
degree as the general area. At edge regions, compaction shall be done adequately to achieve at least 95 per cent
of the density achieved during field trials.
If necessary, vibrating plate compactor or manually driven rollers
can be used to compact edges. Another solution would be the provision of a suitable wide shoulder extension.
Use of kerb stones results in the best edge compaction.
The need to obtain good compaction and also a high standard of surface finish dictates that a limit needs
to be imposed on the maximum thickness of RCFC pavement layer.
In order to achieve full compaction, the
maximum thickness of compacted layer should not be generally more than
1 50 mm. The engineer may, however,
permit placing of RCFC pavement layers upto 200 mm thickness (compacted) if satisfactory compaction is
achieved as shown through
field trials. The minimum compacted thickness of RCFC pavement should not
be less than 100 mm in a single lift. Thickness ofmore than 150 mm are usually constructed in multiple layers.
In order to provide monolithic bond, the next layer should be placed within minimum working period from the
time the previous layer was mixed.
If this cannot be achieved, then retarding agents (0.5 to
1 per cent by weight
of binder depending on ambient temperature) should be used in the preceding run.
Alternatively second layer
may be treated as partially bonded overlay. However, this would result in higher pavement thickness requirement.
For rectifying unevenness in the green stage, concrete of same cement content with aggregate size of 10 mm
and below shall be spread and compacted.
It is necessary to check the rolled surface for unevenness as per
Chapter
10. Surface irregularities should be checked with 3 m straight edge and shall be corrected with the
fresh concrete and rolled.
9.7.3.6.
Curing
: Due to low moisture content of RCFC, it is especially important that surface be kept
moist after placement and curing commenced as soon as practicable. Wet curing methods like spraying of
water or spreading wet Hessian would be advisable. Water curing moderates the temperature of the pavement
and
it is better for both durability of the surface and increased pavement strength.
The total curing period
should extend for at least seven days.
If high fly ash contents are used, this period needs to be extended to at
least 14 days unless a seal coat or overlay is applied within this period.
It is recommended to avoid use of
curing compounds. Opening to traffic should be after 28 days of curing.
9.7.3.7.
Joints
: Sawn contraction joints can be provided in RCFC.
These joints are to be sawn 24
hours after compacting concrete.
The saw cut should be between one quarter to one third of the pavement
depth to provide a suitable plane of weakness to induce a crack beneath (tolerance + 5 mm). Typical spacing of
joints would be between 6 to 8 m, depending on the thickness of the pavement. Generally the maximum joint
spacing should be at an interval of 40 times the thickness of the pavement. The joints should be sealed with
joint sealing compound.
Instead of providing sawn contraction joints, contraction joint inducer (wooden or
242

plastic
strips of triangular section) can be placed at predetermined intervals above sub-base/base before
concreting.
Expansion joints are not provided in RCFC pavement. Usually if over 90 minutes have passed
between placement of two adjacent lanes, the joint is treated as a construction joint. The existing edge should
be cut back to a fresh vertical face and dampened prior to placement of the adjacent material. A reasonable
paving pattern that results in the shortest total length of construction joints should be adopted.

Dry Lean Fly Ash Concrete for Base Course
Dry lean fly ash concrete (DLFC) is similar to dry lean concrete in composition and properties. The
essential difference is with regard to use of fly ash.
9.8.1.
Materials for DLFC
9.8.1.1.
Cement
: Cement should conform to the requirement given in Chapter 4.
9.8.1.2.
Fly ash
: Fly ash to be used for DLFC work should conform to Section 9.7.1.3. However,
unlike roller compacted concrete, where fly ash is used to replace a part of cement, in case of DLFC fly ash is
used to replace part of fine aggregates. Pond ash and bottom ash which do not satisfy Section 9.7. 1 .3 can also
be used provided laboratory strength tests satisfy the design strength requirements.
9.8.1.3.
Aggregates
: Requirements given in Chapter 4 shall apply.
9.8.1.4.
Water
: Water used for mixing and curing ofDLFC shall conform to the requirements of the
Section 9.7.1.4.
9.8.2.
Proportioning of dry lean fly ash concrete
:
Requirements of Chapter 4 shall apply. In
addition, it may be noted that optimal strength is obtained by replacing about 50 per cent of sand (by weight) in
conventional dry lean concrete mix by equal absolute volume of fly ash. However, exact ratio of using sand
and fly ash should be determined based on their specific gravity as shown in Table 9.13.
The ratio of total

aggregate (including fly ash) to cement will be in the range of 1 2- 1 8
. Considerably lower strength would result
when aggregates such as broken bricks or cinders are used. To facilitate selection of suitable proportions of the
trial mix, particulars for a few DLFC mixes, designed using medium coarse sand, good quality crushed coarse
aggregates of 20 mm maximum size and fly ash are given in the Table 9.13.

9.8.3.
Construction operations
9.83.1.
Preparation of subgrade/sub-base
: Procedure given in Section
9.7.3.1 shall be followed.
9.83.2.
Batching and mixing of materials
: The materials for making dry lean fly ash concrete mix
should be batched by weight using approved weigh-batchmg equipment. The batching plant shall be capable of
proportioning the material by weight, each type of material being weighed separately. The cement from the
bulk stock shall be weighed separately from the aggregates. Volume batching may be permitted only when
unavoidable. Water may be measured by volume, using calibrated containers. Proportioning of the construction
materials should be on the basis of designed mix proportions, making due allowance for moisture present in fly
ash and aggregates. The weighing balances shall be calibrated by weighing the aggregates, cement, water and
fly ash physically either by weighing with large weighing machine or using a weigh bridge. The accuracy of
weighing
scales of the batching plant shall be within + 2 per cent by weight in case of aggregates and fly ash
and +
1 per cent by weight in case of cement and water. Batching and mixing shall be carried out preferably in
a central batching and mixing plant having necessary automatic controls to ensure accurate proportioning and
mixing.
Other types of mixers shall be permitted subject to demonstration of their satisfactory performance
during the trial length construction. The mixer should not be overloaded and adequate mixing time should be
allowed to ensure uniform mixing.
9.83.3.
Transportation and placement
: DLFC after mixing shall be discharged immediately from
the mixer, transported directly to the point where it is to be laid and placed on the sub-base to achieve required
depth, slope and camber of the compacted layer. The thickness of loose layer to be laid may be determined
through field trials.
During transportation, DLFC shall be protected from the weather by covering the top
surface of concrete with tarpaulins. The lead of the batching plant to the paving site shall be such that travel
time required will be less than 15 minutes. DLFC should preferably be laid/placed using a paver. The paving
machine shall have high amplitude tamping bars to give good initial compaction to DLFC. Transportation and
placement should be done in a way to avoid segregation. Any portion of the batch, which becomes segregated
during placing, should be thoroughly mixed with fresh concrete before the process of spreading. The laying of
DLFC may be done either in full width or lane by lane. In case quantum of DLFC work taken up is less, the
engineer may permit transportation/laying of DLFC using manual methods.
9.83.4.
Compaction
: When sufficient length of DLFC pavement has been laid to permit rolling,
compaction should be commenced.
Rolling should start from the outer edges of the pavement and continue
towards the centre except at super elevated portions where
it should begin at the lower edge and continue
towards the higher. Double drum smooth-wheeled vibratory rollers of minimum 80-100 kN static weight are
considered to be suitable for rolling DLFC.
In case any other roller is proposed, the same shall be got approved
244

IRC:SP:20-2002
by the engineer, after demonstrating
its performance.
The number of passes required Jo obtain maximum
compaction depends on the thickness of the layer, weight and type of the roller and comparability of the mix.
Initially, 2 or 3 passes are made without vibration, followed by about 6 to 8 passes of roller in vibrating mode.
Final rolling should be performed with a smooth wheeled static roller.
In case soft aggregates, like, brick
aggregates or cinder are used for making DLFC, a lighter roller of capacity 60-80 kN static weight should be
used. Edge compaction procedure,
lift thickness and weather condition limitations shall be as per Section
9.7.3.5. The final surface shall be inspected immediately after compaction while the mix is still plastic and the
grade and camber of the surface should be checked.
All irregularities, loose, segregated or defective areas
should be corrected by removing or adding fresh material of same quality using concrete with aggregates of
size 10 mm and below.
9.83.5.
Joints
: No joints need be provided except construction joints. At construction joints, unless
vertical forms are used, the edge of the compacted material shall be cut back to a vertical face where the
thickness of the properly compacted material has been obtained.
9.83.6.
Curing
: Curing shall commence a soon as DLFC is compacted.
For first 48 hours curing
should be done by covering it with wet gunny bags or Hessian and for subsequent period of not less than 12
days by spreading wet sand or watering frequently in moderate quantities. No traffic should be allowed on this
layer before top courses have been laid.
9.83.7.
Preventing reflection cracking
: DLFC being a semi-rigid material, may develop transverse
cracks because of thermal effects/drying shrinkage. These cracks are likely to get reflected on to the wearing
surface if a thin bituminous wearing course
is laid. To prevent reflection cracking, when DLFC
is used in
composite construction,
it
is recommended that an intermediate layer of bituminous macadam should be
incorporated before providing the asphaltic wearing course. This intermediate layer would absorb the movements
at cracks in the semi-rigid layer, and prevents their reflection on to the surface. In case of rigid pavement,
where DLFC is used as base course, the cement concrete wearing course can be laid directly thereon without
provision of any intermediate layer, since due to greater rigidity of the concrete layer, cracks from the semi-
rigid base do not get reflected.

Cement Stabilised Fly Ash
This work shall consist of laying and compacting a sub-base/base course of fly ash treated with cement
on prepared subgrade/sub-base, in accordance with requirements of this specifications. This technique can be
adopted for improvement of poor subgrades also.
9.9.1.
Materials
9.9.1.1.
Fly ash
: Fly ash to be used for cement-fly ash stabilisation shall conform to Section 9.4.1.1.
Pond ash or bottom ash which do not meet the requirements of Section 9.4.1.1 can also be used for cement
stabilisation work. However, in all cases the cement stabilised fly ash/bottom ash/pond ash mix should develop
adequate strength as given in Section 9.9.2.
9.9.1.2.
Cement
: Requirements of Section 9.7.1.1 shall apply.
9.9.13.
Water
: Requirements of Section 9.7.1 .4 shall apply.
9.9.2.
Mix proportion
: The objective of the mix design procedures is to provide a pavement material
having the required proportions of fly ash and cement to meet the following requirements:
Provide adequate strength and durability
Be easily placed and compacted
Be economical
Amount of cement, less than 2 per cent,
is not generally amenable to proper mixing and hence not
recommended. After deciding cement and fly ash content for trial mix, moisture density relationship has to be
determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983.
The unconfmed compressive strength test is done on
samples compacted at maximum dry density and optimum moisture content. The mix proportion should be
designed to obtain minimum unconfmed compressive strength of 17.5 kg/cm
2 after 7 days moist curing in a
humidity chamber, for samples with a length to diameter ratio of
2:1.
Curing may be carried out in the
temperature range 30 to 38°C. The design mix should not only indicate the proportions of fly ash and cement,
but also mention quantity of water in the mix and a specified compacted density that
is required to satisfy
specified strength.
9.9.3.
Construction operations
9.93.1.
Preparation of subgrade
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.1. shall apply.
9.93.2.
Weather limitations
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.2 shall apply.
9.933.
Mixing and laying
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.3 shall apply.
9.93.4.
Rolling
: Requirements of Section 9.4.3.4 shall apply except that care shall be taken to complete
the rolling operations within two hours of mixing or such shorter period as may be found necessary in dry
weather.
9.9.3.5.
Curing
: The stabilised layer shall be cured for 7 days. Curing shall be done either by using
wet sand or wet Hessian or soaked jute bags. Subsequent pavement course shall be laid soon after the curing
period to prevent the surface from drying out and becoming friable. No traffic shall be allowed over the finished
cement stabilised layer.
9.93.6.
Construction joint
:
No joints except construction joints shall be provided. At the end of
day's work, a transverse joint for full depth may be made by chamfering at an angle of 30°.

9.9.4.
Quality control
:
For satisfactory performance of cement fly ash soil stabilised road, strict
quality control measures are essential.
It is prudent to conduct periodic testing during construction to confirm
that the properties of fly ash being used are with in the range of values anticipated during the design. For each
consignment of cement and fly ash, testing should be done to check quality. Quality control tests and their
minimum desirable frequency are as given in Table 9.15.
Strict control should be exercised during the mix-in-
place operations, with frequent checks on mixing efficiency.
This can be done by trenching through the in-
place material and inspecting the colour of the mixture. Unmixed streaks or layers indicate poor mixing, and
the material in that area should be remixed until uniformity of colour is achieved.

Other Uses of Fly Ash in Road Pavement
Bottom ash or coarse type of fly ash can be used in place of granular sub-base material provided they
have CBR more than
1 5 per cent. However, such bottom ash/pond ash layer should be adequately confined and
well compacted to achieve minimum 98 per cent of modified proctor density.
Bottom ash or coarse type of
pond ash can be used for construction of drainage layer, provided they possess permeability more than 10
4 cm/
s. Fly ash conforming to Section 9.7.1.3 can be used to replace upto 25-30 per cent of cement while making
paving blocks.
9.11.
Iron and Steel Slags
Steel making is a strategic part for the economy of any developing nation, like, India. As a result, a large
number of steel plants have been set up in the country and they are producing several million tonnes of iron and
steel. However, the generation of iron and steel is always associated with the production of waste materials,
like, blast furnace slag, steel slag, granulated blast furnace slag, etc. Normally, generation of one tonne of steel
results in generation of one tonne of solid waste.
Slag can be used as pavement material in a variety of forms.
It can be used as a base or sub base material
either bound or unbound.
Brief details of different types of slags are given in subsequent sections.
9.11.1.
Blast furnace slag
: Blast furnace slag is the non-metallic by-product derived from producing
iron in a blast furnace. This slag mainly consists of silicates and alummo-silicates of calcium. Different kinds
of blast furnace slags are produced based on mode of cooling. When air cooling
is adopted, slag formed
is
similar to coarse aggregates and is called air-cooled blast furnace slag, which can be used for road construction
after testing its strength and soundness properties.
9.11.2.
Granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS)
: When the molten slag is cooled rapidly by means of
high pressure water jets and excess of water is maintained, crystals are not formed and instead it solidifies as a
glassy mass in form of coarse sand, like, material. This material is known as granulated blast furnace slag since
it takes the form of granules.
It has marked pozzolanic property when ground to fine powder.
Experimental
work has been carried out at CRRI to use GBFS as a hydraulic binder in gravel slag and all slag mixes. The
studies indicated that granulated slag, in association with a catalyst, sets to form a mix having high strength
which can be used in subbase or base layer of a pavement.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
9.113.
Steel slag
: Steel slag
is formed when lime flux reacts with iron ore, scrap metal or other
material in a steel furnace. Steel slag consists of fused mixtures of oxides and silicates, mainly calcium, iron,
unslaked lime and magnesium. It is distinguished from blast furnace slag by low SiO, content and high amounts
of iron and calcium oxides. When steel slag is fresh, it contains significant amount of free lime which suggests
that the material could be lacking in stability in the presence of water owing to the hydration of calcium oxide.
However, research has proved that if the steel slag is left for weathering in stockpiles for sufficient period of
time, free lime would slake and the slag would become usable for road construction works.
R&D work has been carried out in CRRI to explore the feasibility of utilising these steel plant by-
products in place of conventional road building materials and subsequently to develop specifications/guidelines
for using these materials m different road layers. Some of the typical test results conducted on slag materials
are shown in the Table 9.16.
In addition to above, soundness tests on steel slag and blast furnace slags were also carried out and both
of these materials were found suitable. Subsequently, these materials were independently tested as mixes. A
large number of combination were tried to develop suitable mixes of blast furnace slag, steel slag and granulated
slag in combination with fly ash. The results indicated that steel plant wastes have a good potential for use as
road pavement material in subbase and base courses of a road pavement. In order to evaluate and assess the
performance of steel plant wastes as a road pavement material, test tracks of about 2 to 3 km were constructed
at Vishakapatnam and Rourkela. The performance of the test sections were monitored for a period of 3 years
and their performance was found satisfactory.

Use of iron and steel slags in road works
: Air-cooled blast furnace slag and weathered steel
slag can be used in place of stone aggregates to construct WBM layers and for mechanical
stabilisation.
Granulated blast furnace slag, which
is a pozzolanic material, can be stabilised using lime and used for
construction of stabilised layers and lime-GBFS concrete base/sub-base. Addition of a small quantity of gypsum
enhances strength. GBFS can also be used in place of granular sub-base provided it meets CBR requirements.
9.12.
Lime-Rice Husk Ash Concrete
Rice husk is available as a waste material from rice mills where paddy is processed to obtain rice. Rice
cultivation is carried out almost throughout India and rice husk is mostly burnt as a fuel. The ash obtained is
thrown back to paddy fields. This ash is chemically similar to fly ash and possesses good binding characteristics
in conjunction with lime and moisture.
It is a pozzolanic binder. CRRI has carried out extensive laboratory
work to investigate the binder properties of lime-rice husk ash mixes and has recommended its use for lime rice
husk ash concrete (Lime-RHA-concrete). The Lime-RHA-Concrete may be used as a sub-base/base course
248

material in the mix proportions 1:2:9 (Lime:RHA; Sand +Coarse aggregate). If a little percentage (2 to 6 per
cent) of gypsum is added the strength properties are greatly enhanced. The RHA is available freely at site in
rural India and no haulage cost is involved.
9.13.
Recyled Concrete Aggregate
Our country has a network of concrete roads built many decades ago and due to increase in traffic and
axle loads, the pavements have badly cracked. The rehabilitation and maintenance is costly and time consuming.
In certain areas where high quality natural aggregates are scarce, recycled concrete aggregates offer an excellent
and economic opportunity. Studies on the use of recycled aggregate (properly graded and having strength
greater than the concrete in which
it
is to be used)
in cement concrete and in water bound macadam stone
metals show that recycled aggregates with suitable modifications can be used again as a road pavement material
in base/sub-base and wearing coarse of road pavement in place of natural aggregate for low volume roads.
9.14.
Other Waste Materials
Many other waste materials like processed municipal wastes, quarry waste, marble slurry dust, other
metallic slags are available in many parts of the country. Laboratory and field studies conducted on some of
these materials have indicated that such materials can be utilised for construction of lower layers of pavement
and/or embankment. However, before embarking use of such materials, detailed characterisation and design of
mix through a reputed laboratory would be needed.

QUALITY CONTROL IN CONSTRUCTION
10.1.
Introduction
Quality should conform to the customer need or user's requirement in all activities and projects. However,
quality is considered as conformance to specifications particularly in construction sector. The quality control is
an essential requirement for all weather rural road construction by adopting IRC/MoRT&H Specifications and
construction methods for creating durable and longer lasting assets for rural India. The overall quality control
ofrural road works must cover controlling of quality of materials and the work at site with the help of objective
tests performed at a reasonable, pre-determined frequency without affecting progress of works.
It is always
advantageous to have separate quality control unit, independent of construction staff to control and monitor the
work. The guidelines in this regard are contained in IRC:SP: 1
1
, "Handbook of Quality Control for Construction
ofRoads and Runways", Clause 900 "Specifications for Road and Bridge Works" ofMoRT&H Specifications
and IRC:SP:57, "Guidelines for Quality Systems for Road
Construction". This Chapter deals with various
quality control requirements related to needed laboratory equipment, code of practice, test frequency, proforma
far record of data and other details there of.
10.2.
Pre-Requisite
Pre-requisite for quality control shall be as follows:
All materials to be used, all methods to be adopted and all works performed shall be strictly in accordance
with the requirement of specifications. Requirement of quality control tests and required frequency shall be
mentioned in the tender document.
In view of low traffic volume on rural roads and smaller size of projects, the requirement of quality
control with respect to frequency of test may be reduced as compared to requirements indicated in MoRT&H
Specifications. Further, reduction in frequency of testing without compromising quality assurance is likely to
expedite progress of the work. However, the Engmeer-in-Charge may decide a higher test frequency for larger
size projects.
The contractor shall set-up a field laboratory ofminimum needed equipments (camber board, sieve sets,
core cutter with accessories and balance with weights upto 0.1 gm accuracy) and a oven to facilitate analysis of
gradation, moisture and field density at locations approved by the Engmeer-in-Charge and depute needed
personnel in order to carryout all required tests at specified frequency and as per the requirements mentioned in
tender or as directed by the Engmeer-in-Charge. For conducting the other required tests, arrangements may be
made with other organizations/laboratories also to meet the requirements of quality control and quality assurance.
In case of larger size projects, contractor may be requested to set up a better laboratory at site or use facilities
created at any other place nearby. The list of equipments and the quality control facilities shall be got approved
from Engmeer-in-Charge in advance before
start of work. The laboratory shall be manned by a qualified
Materials Engineer/Scientists assisted by experienced Laboratory Assistants/Technicians.
For satisfying himself verification about the quality of the material or work, quality control tests will
also be conducted by the Engineer himself or quality control unit or any other technical agency at a pre-decided
frequency. Additional tests may also be conducted where, in the opinion of Engineer, need for such tests is felt.
10.3.
Organisation Set-Up
The requirement of a quality control organisation will vary for different projects depending on departmental
253



======================================================================
PAGE 283 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
set-up and also size of the project. The minimum suggested organisation chart of quality control set-up at
district level shall be as follows:
District Laboratory
Headed by the Executive Engineer and will deal with preparation of quality control programme, training
of staff etc.
Field Laboratory
Depending upon project,
it will deal with routine tests for borrow material and all materials at construction
site at specified frequency
The staff and equipment may be shifted from project to project depending upon requirements. The
project implementation agency has important role as regards to implementation of quality control standards.
The three agencies may be involved in implementation of quality control programme.

Semi-Rigid and Rigid Pavement
The general guidelines for quality control in construction of these types of pavements are as under:
(i)
IRC:SP:1
1 "Handbook of Quality Control for Construction of Roads and Runways"
shall be referred for the quality
control of semi-rigid, rigid pavement and roller compacted concrete pavements.
(ii)
43 Grade Ordinary Portland Cement as per
IS: S
1 12-1989
is generally used. However, the details about the type of
cement and concrete required under different climatic conditions is given in Chapter 4. If the sulphates in soil is more than
0.5
per cent, the cement shall conform to IS:6909.
(iii)
The potable or drinking water may be used for mixing and curing of concrete. The concrete pavement (semi-rigid and
rigid pavement made with cement and other binding materials) should be water cured for a minimum period of
1 4 days,
and preferably for 28 days after 24 hours of casting. The curing may be done either by ponding water or sprinkling water.
If fly ash/granulated slag is used as binder, the curing period may be extended for two more days, to get better results. The
temperature of slabs during curing may be preferably, 27+2°C. Construction of such pavement involving concrete shall
be carried out when the ambient temperature
is between
5
to 40°C.
When temperature of air
is
less than 5°C, the
constituents of concrete mainly water and aggregates are required to be heated. When the temperature of air is more than
40°C, the constituents may be cooled down accordingly. The water used shall conform to IS:456-2000.
(iv)
The crushed aggregate of maximum size of 25 mm and greater than 4.75 mm and sand (size less than 4.75 mm) may be
used for construction of both semi-rigid and RCC pavements, and
it shall conform to IS:383-1970 "Specification for
Coarse and Fine Aggregates from Natural Sources". The water absorption in the aggregates shall not be more than 2 per
cent (IRC:SP:49).
260



======================================================================
PAGE 290 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(v)
Guidelines
for
cement concrete mix
design for both semi-rigid and rigid pavement/RCCP
shall be as per IRC:44
"Tentative Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for Pavements". The minimum flexural strength of concrete for
RCCP shall be 40 kg/sq.cm in the field assuming good degree of quality control
in the field. The minimum compressive
strength of concrete for DLC shall be 100 kg/sq.cm at 7 days.
The approximate mix proportions by weight shall be as
1:1.4:2.75 (Cement:Sand:Coarse aggregate) with water/cement ratio 0.38 for cement concrete pavement. Slump of 0 to
5 mm may be used for DLC or RCCP and slump of
1 5-20 mm may be kept for pavement quality concrete. The mix design
for DLC shall be such that the maximum aggregatexement ratio shall be 16:1.
(vi)
Tools, equipments and appliances for rigid/semi-rigid pavement construction shall be as per IRC:43 and IRC:SP:49".
Edging tool shall be used for making the sharp edges of the joints in the slabs. Proper care shall be taken while making
edges. Excessive compaction of the concrete shall be avoided. This can be checked by the fact that no extra water or
bleeding shall occur on the top surface of concrete. Excessive water at the top will make the top surface very weak. Edges
of concrete pavement shall also be about
1 meter away from a tree, if any.
(vii)
To provide adequate drainage, the base course and sub-base courses shall be provided with adequate camber (2 per cent).
Longitudinal slope may be considered as
1
in 500. The slope shoulder may be provided as given in
Chapter 2. Shoulder
may be of compacted earth, brick soling or any other suitable material.
(viii) Cement (physical and chemical test), fine aggregate (gradation, deleterious constituents, moisture content test), coarse
aggregate (crushing value/Los Angeles abrasion value, soundness, alkali aggregate reaction test), fly ash (physical and
chemical test) and water (physical and chemical test) shall be tested
once
for each source of supply and occasionally
when called
for.
In case of water when
it will require long and/or improper storage of water,
it will be tested more
frequently.
(ix)
Six number of cement concrete cubes shall be cast daily to check 7 and 28 days strength as per IRC:SP:
1
1
The minimum
compressive strength of any individual cube for DLC shall not be
less than 7.5 MPa. The aggregate shall have water
absorption not more than 2 per cent and silt content (size less than 75 micron ) shall not exceed 3 per cent in case of natural
aggregate. The average
flexural strength of concrete obtained in the field shall not be less than 40 kg/sqem for PQC or
RCC and the flexure strength of any individual beam shall not be less than 35 kg/sqem.
(x)
Adequate quality control should be exercised
at all stages of construction by suitably trained staff as per guidelines given
in IRC:
1 5 "Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Construction of Concrete Roads", IRC:SP:
1
1 " Handbook of
Quality Control for Construction of Roads and Runways", and IRC SP:49, "Guidelines forthe Use of Dry Lean Concrete
as Sub-Base for Rigid Pavement".
(xi)
The difference between the highest and the lowest value of flexural strength at 28 days shall not be more than
1 5 per cent
of the average flexural strength of PQC/RCC.
(xii)
Mould for test beam shall be
1 Ox
1 0x50 cm and for cubes 15x15x15 cm conforming to IS:5 16-1 959.
(xiii) The angle between any two joints of DLC should be right angle or obtuse, and joints shall
be staggered (by 20 cm to 40
cm as per IRC:SP:49) with each other (Contraction, Construction) with the overlaying concrete.
(xiv)
The minimum K-value (modulus of subgrade reaction) of subgrade\sub-base shall be 5.54 kg/cm
3 (minimum CBR
1 0 per
cent)
The K-value ofDLC of
1 0 cm thickness, is generally between
1 0-20 kg/cm
3 which is greater than the minimum K-
value (taken as 5.54 kg/cm
3
). If dry fly ash of lime reactivity greater than 40 kg/sqem is available within reasonable lead,
the same may be used as replacement of cement by 10-25 per cent as performance improver in PQC/RCCP. 50 per cent
of sand can also be replaced by
fly ash
in Dry Lean Cement Concrete (DLC) to have better durability,
less heat of
hydration and better finishing, provided 28 days strength
is not reduced. The type of cement to be used for construction
is given in Chapter 6.
(xv)
The compaction of concrete shall be completed critically within
1 20 minutes if temperature is less than 25°C and not more
than 90 minutes when the temperature is between 25 and 40°C. The concrete temperature shall not exceed 40°C.
(xvi)
The permissible maximum variation in
thickness of layers shall be 10 mm.
(xvii) The other required tests for quality control and their frequency are given in Table
1 0.

Quality control of concrete blocks for CBP/ICBP
: M 30 or higher grade concrete shall be
used in production of blocks required for paving of trafficked road. When M 30 grade concrete is used, the 28
days compressive strength of 1 5 cm cubes shall be 300 kg/cm
2
. M 25 grade concrete may also be used when the
blocks are to be used for paving in non-trafficked areas like footpaths. Relationship between 28 days compressive
strength of 15 cm cubes and blocks produced in Block Making Machine (BMM)/hydraulic press shall be
established, so that the block strength can be related to concrete strength. For quality control of blocks, from
each lot of 200 blocks, 3 blocks shall be selected at random for water absorption and 28 days compressive
strength tests. The block may be first tested for water absorption and the test results recorded as per Format SP-
1
. The same blocks shall then be tested for apparent compressive strength, and the test results recorded as per
Format SP-2. The corrected compressive strength of blocks shall be calculated by applying the appropriate
correction factor to the compressive strength value so obtained as indicated in Table 10.12.
Water absorption of blocks shall be below 8 per cent. Mean compressive strength shall be equal to or
higher than the design strength. Upto 10 per cent variation of individual values from mean value may be
allowed. Blocks rejected for paving in traffic areas can be used for non-traffic areas, if otherwise found suitable.

used as edge restraints, which shall be partially embedded in the base course. Bricks produced with a high
content of lime in the clay will enhance the service
life of brick pavement. Proper surface profile shall be
maintained during construction.
10.93.
Quality control for new materials
: New materials, like, geotextiles and modified binders
can also be used in specific cases. The quality control tests as required for use of these materials shall be as
given in Clause 903.4.1 of MoRT&H Specifications.
10.10.
Alignment, Level and Surface Regularity
All road works carried out shall conform to the lines, grades, cross-sections and dimensions shown on
the drawings or as directed by the Engineer, subject to the permitted tolerances described in the respective
Sections. Tests, viz., ALS-1, ALS-2, ALS-3 and ALS-4 are required to be conducted for control of alignment
level, and surface regularity.
10.10.1.
Horizontal alignments (ALS-1)
: Horizontal alignments shall be reckoned with respect to the
centre line of the roadway as shown on the drawings. The edges of the roadway as constructed shall be corrected
within a tolerance of 20 mm therefrom. The corresponding tolerance for edges of the roadway and lower layers
of pavement shall be 30 mm. For hill roads, the tolerances shall be as specified by the Engineer-in-Charge.
10.10.2.
Surface levels of pavement courses (ALS-2)
: The levels of the subgrade and different
pavement courses as constructed, shall not vary from those calculated with reference to the longitudinal and
cross profile of the road shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer-in-Charge. The tolerances
normally accepted are mentioned in Table 10.13. For checking compliance with the above requirement for
subgrade, sub-base and base courses, measurements of the surface levels shall be taken on a suitable grid.
Maximum two measurement shall be permitted to exceed the tolerance as above, including one measurement
being not in excess of
5 mm above the permitted tolerance. For checking the compliance with the above
requirement for bituminous wearing courses and concrete pavements, measurements of the surface levels shall
be taken on a suitable grid of points spaced at 6.25 m along the length and at 0.5 m from the edges of the
pavement.

Appendix-10.3
Laboratory Testing for Properties of Soil (IS:2720)
Soil
is one of the principal materials of construction for embankments and stabilised soil base and
su-bbase courses. Some important tests on soil as an engineering material are as under
:
1.
Plasticity Index (IS:2720-Part 5)
(i)
Liquid Limit (LL)
The test
is carried out in a standard Casagrande Liquid Limit Device in which a cup containing a grooved specimen
is
made to fall on a rubber Plate. The number of blows to close the groove to a length of about 12.5 mm
is determined for
different moisture content. The moisture content corresponding to 25 blows is determined from a plot between number of
blows and moisture content.
A simpler alternative method to determine the liquid limit is the Uppal's penetrometer. In thjs method, the liquid limit is
the moisture content corresponding to 25 mm penetration of a standard cone in the soil paste which is computed when the
penetration ranges between 20 mm to 28 mm.
(ii)
Plastic Limit (PL)
The moisture content at which a soil water mix when rolled into a thread on a glass plate starts crumbling at
3 mm dia
gives the plastic limit of the soil.
(iii)
Plasticity Index (PI)
The numerical difference between liquid limit and plastic limit
is the plasticity index. Thus,
it
is determined from the
liquid limit and plastic limit values of soil. A rough estimate of this can also be made using Uppal's Syringe. A soil paste
is made by adding water to soil such that water is above the plastic limit of soil. This paste is put into the syringes and
pushed out through the holes in the cap. Depending upon the texture of the thread, the PI can be estimated.
2.
Sieve Analysis (IS:2720-Part 4)
The particle size distribution is by far the simplest way of broadly classifying a soil in terms of its being
granular, medium grained and fine grained. The sieve analysis consists simply in taking weighed quantity of
the sample, soaking
it in water overnight and washing out the finer fraction through 75 micron IS Sieve. The
fraction retained is dried and then passed through a series of sieves. However, for the rural road works, a set of
7 sieves is recommended. To be able to broadly evaluate the particle size distribution of a soil even three sieves
namely 2.36 mm, 425 micron and 75 micron may suffice. While a mechanical shaker is generally used in well
equipped laboratories, manual shaking of sieves is considered sufficient if carried out for a period not less than
three minutes. In case of dry cohesionless soil such as sand, dry sieve analysis may be carried out.
3.
Proctor Compaction (IS:2720-Part 7)
This test is conducted to determine the achievable density in field and the optimum moisture required for
compaction. It is conducted in a proctor mould (IS:2720 Part-7 1980) apparatus. The soil sample is compacted
in three layers giving 25 blows on each side by a standard rammer at five different moisture contents. From the
plot between moisture content and dry density, the optimum moisture content and maximum dry density are
determined. In case of heavy compaction method (IS:2720 Part-8
1983),
soil sample
is compacted in five
layers (depending on the size of the mould) giving 56 blows using a IS heavy rammer.
4.
CBR(IS:2720-Part 16)
It is extensively used for the design of flexible pavements in India. The test is carried out on a sample
compacted at optimum moisture content to maximum dry density and soaked for 4 days. In case of stabilised
specimen, the specimen is cured for 7 days in wet sand and then subjected to the 4 days soaking. The CBR of
the specimen is computed from the load needed for 2.5 mm/5.0 mm penetration of a standard plunger determined
from the graph between penetration and load. If required the zero correction is applied for penetration while
computing the load for 2.5 mm/5.0 mm penetration.

Appendix-10.4
Laboratory Testing for Properties of Road Aggregates (IS:2386)
The performance of pavement depend to a great extent on the correct choice of quality and quantity of
aggregates as they form the major constituent ofroad construction materials. Since the aggregates have to bear
the brunt of traffic, strength or resistance to degradation of aggregates as well as structural stability offered by
mechanical interlock of aggregate particles in a layer form are important factors.
IS:2386- 1 963 (Parts
I to
VIII) gives the methods of tests for aggregates for road construction.
Great care
is necessary in taking out samples of aggregates for testing unless the samples are true
representative, the results of various tests may not reflect accurately their characteristics. For sampling of
coarse aggregates, fine aggregates and filler, use of a flat shovel is preferable when working on a flat surface to
ensure that a representative proportion of fines is picked up. The aggregates should be surface dry.
Suitable
form of sample divider is the riffle box.
In case, a sample divider is not available, the representative sample
may be obtained by quartering. For more details on sampling, IS:2386- 1 963 (Part I) may be referred to.
Some of the important tests on aggregates for road construction are given in the following paragraphs:
(i)
Sieve Analysis
: The test procedure is described in IS:2386-1963 (Part I). The required quantity of
sample of aggregates is sieved manually or mechanically on a standard set of sieves depending
upon the maximum size of aggregates and the percentage retained on each sieve is determined.
The test results are expressed as per cent by weight passing each sieve. Sieve analysis test gives the
particle size distribution in a sample of aggregate.
(ii)
Shape of Aggregates
: Aggregates have three different shapes, viz. cubical, flaky and elongated.
While cubical aggregates are good for development of mechanical interlock between aggregate
particles and consequently for achieving structural stability in a bituminous mix, flaky and elongated
aggregates are considered to be undesirable due to their greater susceptibility to fracture and larger
surface area per unit volume requiring higher quantity of bitumen for coating.
The presence of
some quantity of flaky and elongated particles in an aggregate mass
is inevitable, as these are
bound to be produced in the aggregate crushing operation.
But appropriate standards have been
prepared to limit the quantity of such particles in an aggregate mass depending upon a particular
use of such aggregates. The weight of flaky (or elongated) particles expressed as per cent of total
sample of aggregates and weight of long particles as a per cent of non-flaky material is known as
flakmess and elongation index respectively.
A flaky particle is one whose least dimension (thickness) is less than 0.6 times its mean dimension.
The test is not applicable to aggregates of sizes smaller than 6.3 mm.
An elongated particle is one whose greatest dimension (length) is greater than 1.8 times its mean
dimension. The test procedure is given in IS:2386-1 963 (Part 1). The elongation test is not applicable
to aggregates of sizes smaller than 6.3 mm.
(hi)
Specific Gravity
: Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a given absolute volume of aggregates
to the mass of an equal volume of water at a specified temperature. The test procedure is given in
IS:2386-1963 (Part 3).
The specific gravity value of aggregates is required in computation of
voids in bituminous mix design.
For coarse aggregates, the wire basket method
is used for
determination of specific gravity, while for fine aggregates, the pyknometer method is used.
For
filler materials, specific gravity bottle is used.

: Water absorption is the difference in weight of aggregates between 24 hours
water-saturated surface-dry condition and oven-dry condition expressed as percentage of the latter.
The test procedure is given in IS:2386-1963 (Part 4). Water absorption is high for porous aggregates.
It is necessary to provide extra binder in a bituminous premix at the rate of 0.5 per cent for every
1 per cent water absorption in excess of 2 per cent.
(v)
Aggregates Impact Value
: Number of tests are used to evaluate strength characteristics of
aggregates. A simple test, which is also correlated with other tests, is the Aggregate Impact Test.
The test procedure is given in IS:2386-1963 (Part 4). The aggregate impact value gives a measure
of resistance of aggregates degradation due to impact, which differs from characteristics value of
resistance to crushing under slow compressive load.
In the aggregate impact test, 12.5 to 10 mm
size clean dry aggregates of specified volume are subjected to
15 blows of a
13.5
to
14.0 kg
hammer falling from a height of 380 ± 5 mm.
The weight of the sample of aggregates passing
2.36 mm sieve after the test expressed as percentage of the original weight is the aggregate impact
value. The lower the aggregate impact value, the higher is its strength.
(vi)
Soundness
: This test indicates the susceptibility of aggregates to disintegration under the action
of water containing sodium and magnesium sulphates.
The
test procedure
is described
in
IS:2386-1963 (Part 5). Washed and dried aggregates of specified sizes are immersed in saturated
solution of sodium sulphate/magnesium sulphate for 16 to 18 hours. The sample is then removed
and dried to constant weight.
This forms one cycle.
The test is repeated for 5 cycles.
After
5 cycles, the sample is washed, dried in an oven and re-sieved on those very sieves which were
used before the test. The material retained on each sieve is recorded. The cumulative difference
between the amounts of material retained on each of the sieves before and after the test is the loss
due to disintegration and is expressed as percentage of total
initial weight of the sample.
The
permissible value for loss in sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate after 5 cycles are 12 per
cent and 18 per cent respectively.
If the loss is more, then the aggregates are likely to disintegrate
by water containing such salts.
(vii)
Stripping Value
: Stripping
is the displacement of bitumen film from a coated road aggregate
particle in the presence of water. The details of test procedure are given in IS:6241-1971
.
In this
test, 20 to 12.5 mm size aggregates are coated with 5 per cent bitumen under specified conditions
and immersed in distilled water at 40°C for 24 hours.
The average per cent area of aggregate
surface stripped is assessed visually, while the aggregates are under water. The amount of stripped
area expressed as per cent, is the stripping value.

Appendix-10.5
Testing of Bituminous Materials
IS:73-1992 specify the requirements of penetration grade bituminous binders. All the tests are detailed
in IS:1201, IS:1220,
IS: 105 12 and
IS:9381. IS:8887-1995 has specified requirement of catiomc bitumen
emulsions. A few important tests and their significance are briefly described below:
(A)
Tests on Bitumens
(1)
Specific Gravity
: Details of test are given in IS -.1202-197 8. It is defined as the ratio of the mass of
a given volume of the bitumen to the mass of an equal volume of water at 27°C.
It
is used to
compute the volume ofbitumen and determination of voids in compacted bitumen mixture in Marshall
method of mix design.
It is determined by pyknometer.
(ii) Water Content Test
: This test is specified in IS: 121 1-1978.
Water content is determined using
Dean and Stark method.
It is desired that bitumen should contain minimum water content.
The
maximum limit
is 0.2 per cent as per IS:73-1992. Water Content more than the specified limit
causes frothing during heating.
(in) Flash and Fire Point by Cleveland Open Cup
:
This test is
specified in IS: 1209-1978.
It is
defined as the lowest temperature in °C
at which the vapour from heated bitumen catches
fire
momentarily in the form of flash. The fire point is the lowest temperature in °C at which the vapour
of bitumen ignite on application of flame at least for 5 second. The heating rate is 5°C/minute. This
test is indicative of fire hazard, if a bitumen is heated beyond flash point. The fire point is usually
5-10°C higher than flash point. The minimum limit of flash point is 220°C.
(iv) Softening Point Test (Ring and Ball)
: Details of apparatus and procedure are given in IS: 1205-
1978.
Softening point,
is a temperature measured in °C, at which a bituminous binder attains a
particular degree of softness under specified test conditions. Distilled water is used as bath medium
for bitumens with softening point value below 80°C and glycerol for value beyond 80°C.
The
temperature of bath
is raised at 5 C/mmute from 5°C in case of water and from 35°C in case of
glycerol. The temperature, at which, a standard steel ball (3.5 g) placed over bitumen touches a base
plate 25 mm below the ring is recorded as softening point.
It signifies the temperature at which
bitumen passes from semi-solid state to liquid state and indicate the atmospheric temperature at
which the bitumen is likely to bleed. Hence, softening point of a bitumen should be 5-10°C higher
than the maximum atmospheric temperature.
(v)
Penetration Test
: This test is specified in IS: 1203-1978.
It is conducted to measure consistency
and identify the grade of bitumen.
It is defined as vertical distance traversed by a standard needle in
0. 1mm unit under a known load (lOOg), at a fixed temperature (25°C), for a known time (5 second).
The distance in 0.1mm units
is known as penetration.
Therefore, the greater the penetration of
needle, the softer the bitumen.
For each test three measurements are needed at 10 mm apart on
bitumen surface.
Repeatability
:
if penetration
is less than 50,
1
unit
If penetration
is more than 50, 3 per cent of mean
if penetration
is more than 50, 4 units
If penetration
is more than 50, 8 per cent of the mean

(vi) Ductility Test
: Standard test procedure is described in IS: 1208-1978.
Ductility is measured in cm
and is defined as the distance in cm to which a briquette bitumen specimen will elongate before
breaking when it is pulled apart at 5 cm/min. rate at 27°C. The corss-section at minimum width of
specimen is 10 mm x 10 mm. Sample is to be prepared in standard mould and to be placed at 27°C
for minimum 90 minutes,
ll signified the property by virtue of which a bitumen can exist in a thin
film without breaking.
(vh) Viscosity Test
: Viscosity of bitumen plays a vital role for different operations of bituminous road
construction. The suggested viscosity values are given below
:
Operation
Viscosity, cST
Pumping
600-800
Spraying
50-200
Mixing
150-300
Laboratory mixing
1 50-
1 90
Laboratory compaction
250-3
1
0
Rolling
1000-10,000
From the viscosity temperature relationship, the appropriate temperature for various operation of
bituminous road construction can be determined.
It
is a standard test specified in IS: 1206- 1978.
Viscosity is defined as resistance to flow due to internal friction of bitumen.
In Industrial units, it is
measured by time in second taken by specified volume of bitumen/cutback bitumen/emulsion to
flow from 10 mm/4 mm orifice cup of standard tar viscometer or saybolt-furol viscometer. There
are several cup viscometers available which differs mainly in the size of opening through which
bitumen is drained.
Absolute viscosity = flow time x density
x K. The value of K for 4 mm cup
(STV),
1 0 mm cup (STV), and saybolt-furol viscometer are 0.0132, 0.400 and 0.002 1 8 respectively.
The test results may be expressed as
: kinematic viscosity = flow time x K.
It can measure viscosity
between 320-5600 cSt. Kinematic viscosity is expressed in Stocks, which can be obtained by dividing
absolute viscosity by density.
It is measured by recording time in seconds required for fixed quantity
of material to flow through a glass capillary viscometer at a given temperature. The product of time
flow and calibration factor gives the kinematic viscosity.
(viii)Loss on Heat Test
: This test is specified in IS: 1212-1978.
It
is defined as the per cent loss in
weight (exclusive of water content) of volatiles, when a sample of bitumen (50 g)
is heated at a
standard temperature (163°C) under specified test conditions. Sample is prepared in a penetration
cup (55 mm dia and 35 mm depth) and placed
in an oven for
5 Va hours on
a rotating shelf
(5-6 revolutions per minute).
Penetration test
is also conducted on the sample before and after
heating. This test signified the resistance of a bitumen to hardening during construction. The loss in
weight and per cent retained penetration values are reported.

IRC:SP:20-2002
(ix) Solubility in Trichloroethylene (TCE)
: Details of test are given in IS: 1216-1978.
It is a measure
of the purity ofbitumen ( 1 -2 g) in the solvent and separating the msolubles by filtering over asbestos
mat in gooch crucible. The limit for solubility of bitumen in TCE is minimum 99 per cent.
(x)
Stripping Test
: Stripping (IS: 6241-1971) is the displacement of bitumen film from coated road
aggregates in the presence of water.
In this test 20-12.5 mm size aggregates are coated with 5 per
cent bitumen under specified conditions and immersed in distilled water at 40°C for 24 hours. The
average percentage area of aggregate surface stripped is assessed visually. The amount of stripped
area expressed as per cent, is the stripping value. The permissible maximum limit is 15 per cent.
Stripping value of different types of aggregate is invariable. A higher value indicates possibility of
loss of adhsion between aggregate and bitumen in presence of water. The stripping depends upon
type of aggregate shape, size, grain size, surface texture, mineralogical composition, moisture, acidity
and alkalinity.
(B) Tests on Bitumen Emulsions (IS: 8887)
(i)
Sieve Test on IS 600 Micron Sieve
: This test complements the settlement test.
It is a stability test,
used to find out amount of bitumen in the form of larger globules in a emulsion, which cannot be
determined by settlement test. The larger drops can clog spraying equipment and will not provide
uniform coating. A specified amount of sample is poured through a IS 600 micron sieve.
After
rinsing with distilled water, the sieve and bitumen are dried in oven. The amount of retained bitumen
is determined by weighing and reported as residue on sieving.
(ii)
Binder Content
: The binder content in bitumen emulsion can be determined by a distillation test.
A specified, quantity of emulsions sample (50 g)
is distilled under specified test conditions.
The
binder content is determined by substracting percentage of water content from 100. The residue is
used for further testing to check the quality of bitumen in a emulsion.
(iii) Stability to Mixing with Coarse Aggregates
: This test has a three fold purpose.
It determines the
ability (l) to coat the aggregate (ii) to withstand mixing action while remaining as a film on aggregates
and (iii) to resist washing action ofwater after completion of mixing. The method is used to determine
coagulation value using aggregate (200 g) and emulsion (50 g)
(iv) Viscosity by Standard Saybolt-Furol Viscometer (IS:31 17)
: Viscosity
is defined as a fluid's
resistance to flow.
In the case of emulsion, the Saybolt-furol viscosity test is used as a measure of
consistency.
Results are reported in Saybolt-Furol seconds. The viscosities of RS (Rapid Setting)
and MS (Medium Setting) emulsions are determined in seconds at 50°C and of SS (Slow Setting)
emulsions at 25°C respectively.
(v)
Storage-Stability Test
: This test is used to determine the ability of an emulsion to remain as a
uniform dispersion during storage. A measured quantity of sample
is placed in two cylinders
(stoppered) and allowed to stand for 24 hours. A specified sample is siphoned from the top and
placed in oven for a set time at a specified temperature.
They are removed, allowed to cool and
weighed after the top sample is removed but a small portion of bitumen emulsion remaining in each
cylinder is siphoned off. A specified portion that is left is put through the same procedure as for the
top sample.
The storage stability
is expressed as the numerical difference between the average
percentage of bituminous residue found in two top samples and two bottom samples.

( vi )
Particle Charge
: The particle charge test is conducted to identity catiomc emulsion by its positive
charge.
It is performed by immersing two copper Pates 25x75 mm which are connected to a 12
volt circuit.
At the end of specified period of 2 minutes, an appreciable quantity of bitumen is
deposited on cathode indicating a cationic emulsion.
(vii)
Miscibility with Water
: This test finds, if MS and SS emulsion can be mixed with water.
It is
not applicable for RS emulsions.
After adding and stirring with distilled water, the emulsion
sample is allowed to stand for two hours.
It is then examined for any appreciable coagulation of
the bitumen droplets in an emulsion.
This test is a measure of quality of emulsion.
(vm)
Stability with Cement
: The cement mixing does the same for SS emulsion, as the test does for
RS emulsions.
In the cement mixing test, a sample is mixed with finely-ground Portland cement
and mixture is washed over a IS
1 .4 mm Sieve. The amount of material retained may be recorded
as per cent coagulation.
(ix)
Test on Residue
: Penetration, ductility and solubility in trichlorothylene tests are conducted after
distillation test to check the quality ofbitumen. These tests are conducted as per procedures specified
in IS:1201-1220.

Rate of Spread of Binder in Surface Dressing and Modified Penetration Macadam
Light metal trays of 20 cm x 20 cm size and 3 cm depth are weighed and numbered. These are placed at
intervals along the road in the path of bitumen distributor between the wheel tracks. After the distributor has
passed over, the trays are removed and wrapped in weight sheets of paper so that they can be handled, stocked
and weighed as soon as convenient. The spacing and the number of trays can be varied to suit the particular
conditions at the construction site, but at least five trays should normally be used. The tray test gives a measure
of variation in rate of spread of bitumen along the road and a good approximation to the average rate of spread
of bitumen.
The trays are weighed correct to first place of decimal. The maximum longitudinal distribution error in
rate of spread of bitumen should be within ±10 per cent of the specified rate of spread of bitumen. Similarly
transverse distribution of bitumen can be checked by placing a number of trays to collect bitumen sprayed over
each 5 cm width of spray bar. The variation in transverse distribution should be withm ± 20 per cent from the
mean. The extreme 15 cm width at either side of the sprayed area need not be taken into account.

Appendix-J0.8
Determination of Bitumen Content in Bituminous Mix
The test is intended for determination of bitumen content m the bituminous mix by cold solvent extraction
method. The mineral aggregates recovered from the test can be used for checking their gradation. A representative
bituminous mix sample of about 500 gm by weight is accurately weighed and placed in the bowl of extraction
apparatus and covered with commercial grade of tnchloroethylene. Sufficient time (not more than one hour) is
allowed for dissolving the bitumen in solvent. The filter ring of the extractor is dried, weighed and then fitted
around the edge of the bowl. The cover of the bowl is clamped tightly. A beaker is placed under the dram to
collect the extract. The machine
is revolved slowly and then gradually the speed is increased to a maximum of
3600 rpm. The speed is maintained till the solvent ceases to flow from the drain. The machine is allowed to
stop, 200 ml of solvent is added and the above procedure is repeated. A number of
200 ml solvent additions
(not less than three) are used till the extract is clear and not darker than a light straw colour. The filter ring from
the bowl
is removed, dried first in air and then in oven at
1 15°C to constant weight, and weighed. The fine
materials that might have passed through the
filter paper are collected back from the extract preferably by
centrifuging. The material
is washed and dried to constant weight as before. The percentage of binder in the
bituminous mix sample is calculated as follows:
W,-(W
2 + w
3 + W4)
Percentage of Binder =

Appendix-10.9
Determination of In-Situ Density of Bituminous Course
The metallic tray of the field density unit is kept on a level spot of the bituminous surface and a hole,
10 cm in diameter, is cut up to the full thickness of the layer. All bituminous materials removed from the hole
are carefully collected and weighed. The thickness of the layer is also recorded.
A known weight of dry standard sand passing 600 micron sieve and retained on 300 micron sieve,
is
taken in the sand-pourmg cylinder. The cylinder is kept directly over the hole, and the shutter of the cylinder is
released without any jerk and closed when the hole is filled with the sand. The quantity of the residual sand in
the cylinder as well as the quantity filling the cone of the cylinder are separately weighed.
The m-situ density of the layer is calculated as follows:
In-situ density = (A*D)/(W-(W +WJ) gm /cc
Where,
A
= Weight of bituminous materials removed from the hole cut in the layer, gm
W
=
initial weight of sand taken in the cylinder, gm
W =
weight of sand filling the cone of the cylinder, gm
W, = weight of sand remaining in the cylinder, gm

Prior calibration for depth of hole, is necessary.
Appendix-10.10
Rate of Spread of Aggregates in Surface Dressing
The rate of spread of aggregates by the aggregate spreader or any other suitable means can be checked
by measuring the area covered by each lorry/truck/any other device ofknown capacity. This can also be checked
by removing the spread aggregates from small areas of the road surface and weighing them. A 20 cm square
metal frame is laid on the new surface dressing, and all the aggregates within the enclosed area are collected,
washed in solvent to remove bitumen and then weighed, and the rate of spread of aggregates is calculated. It is
measured along the road at intervals of between 4 m to 8 m. The variation in the rate of spread of aggregates
should be within ± 20 per cent of the mean.

Appendix-10.11
Checking of Surface Regularity Using a Straight Edge
The procedure to be followed for checking the surface regularity with a straight edge is as follows:
(1)
The 3 metre straight edge may be made of steel or seasoned hard wood. When made ofwood, it may
be 75 mm wide and 125 mm deep and its test face should preferably be lined with a metallic plate.
The edge should be perfectly straight and free from warps, rots or defects of any kind.
(ii)
Periodically, the straight edge should be checked for its trueness with a string or a metallic master
straight edge. The straight edge should be rectified or replaced as soon as the same has lost
its
trueness.
(hi) The depressions under the straight edge are to be measured with a graduated wedge. The wedge
should be preferably be metallic but may alternatively be of seasoned upto 25 mm with a least count
of at least 3 mm.
(iv) For recording depressions in the longitudinal profile of the road surface, the straight edge is placed
longitudinally, parallel to the centre line of the road. Measurements along two parallel lines may
normally be sufficient for a single lane road.
(v)
The straight edge has limitations as regards the measurement of undulations at vertical curves.
Additional templates or straight edges may be made for this purpose specially
if the curves are
sharp.
(vi) The straight edge may be placed at the starting point with the wedge inserted between it and the test
surface, where the gap is maximum, and the reading is taken. The wedge may then be slided forward
by about 1.5 m distance and the wedge reading is recorded. This process is continued. The straight
edge need not always be moved forward to record the maximum depression existing at a location.
Locations with depressions in excess of the specified magnitude should be marked on the surface.
A team of three persons consisting of two workmen and a supervisor would be required for one straight
edge and two graduated wedges. The two workmen will operate the straight edge, while the supervisor will
record measurements with the wedges and do the markings on the road.

MAINTENANCE
11.1.
Introduction
Road maintenance is a routine work performed to upkeep pavement, shoulders and other facilities provided
for road users, as nearly as possible in its constructed conditions under normal conditions of traffic and forces
of nature. The maintenance
is essential to get optimum service from the pavement structure during
its life
period. All pavements require maintenance as they are subjected to the traffic and environmental effects.
Maintenance helps in preserving the pavement surface, and prevents untimely rehabilitation. Also, the
maintenance of shoulders, CD works and road furniture is equally important. Unsealed roads get deteriorated
at faster rate as compared to the sealed roads and hence needs greater attention. Also maintaining the cross
profile (for proper surface drainage) and repair of pot holes need special attention. Maintenance requirements
are also dependent on traffic, terrain, soil type etc. However, there are proven maintenance methods, which are
applicable to the different regions in the country.
11.2.
Distresses/Defects in Pavements
Various types of distress/defects of pavements are listed below:
I. Flexible Pavements
(i)
Cracks: Separation of the pavement due to natural causes, traffic action, or reflections from an underlying pavement.
(ii)
Alligator Cracks: Interconnected cracks forming a series of small blocks resembling an alligator's skin or chicken wiremesh
(iii)
Bleeding: The upward movement of bitumen in a bituminous pavement resulting in the formation of a film of bitumen on
the surface.
(iv)
Corrugations: A form of plastic movement typified by ripples across the pavement surface.
(v)
Depression/Settlement: Localised low areas of limited size that may or may not be accompanied by cracking.
(vi)
Disintegration: The breaking up of a pavement surface from its original shape.
(vii) Ravelling: The progressive separation of aggregate particles in a pavement from the surface downward or from the edges
inward.
(viii) Rutting: channelised depressions that may develop in the wheel tracks of the bituminous pavement.
(ix)
Potholes: Bowl shaped holes of varying sizes in the pavement, resulting from localised disintegration.
(x)
Shoving: A form of plastic movement resulting in localised bulging of pavement.
(xi)
Upheaval: The localised upward displacement of a pavement due to swelling of the subgrade or some portion of the
pavement structure.
II. Semi-Rigid and Rigid Pavements
(i)
Blow-up: The localised buckling or shattering of a rigid pavement occurring usually at transverse crack or joint.
(ii)
Pumping: The ejection ofmixture of water, sand, clay and/or silt under passing wheel loads, along transverse or longitudinal
joints and cracks and along pavement edges.
(iii)
Reflection cracks: Cracks in the asphalt overlays that reflect the crack pattern in the rigid pavement structure underneath.
(iv)
Scaling: The peeling away or disintegration of cement concrete pavement.
(v)
Spalling: The excessive joint deformation in concrete pavement leading to over-hang of slabs at joints and subsequent
cracking.
11.3.
Definitions of Maintenance Activities
Some of the terms related to the maintenance activities are defined below
:
(i)
Fog Seal: A light application of slow-setting asphalt emulsion diluted with water.
It is used to renew old asphalt surfaces
and to seal small cracks and surface voids.
317



======================================================================
PAGE 347 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(ii)
Prime Coat: An application of a single coat of liquid bituminous material, like an emulsified asphalt (low-viscosity
cutback in case of locations at sub-zero temperatures).
It
is used only on an untreated base prior to placement of the
asphalt pavement.
(iii)
Seal Coat: A thin asphalt surface treatment used to waterproof and improve the texture of an asphalt wearing surface.
Depending on the purpose, seal coats may or may not be covered with aggregate. The main types of seal coats are fog
seals, aggregate seals, slurry seals, and sand seals.
(iv)
Bituminous Surface Treatments: Applications of bituminous materials to any type of road or pavement surface, with or
without a cover of mineral aggregate, that improve the surface condition and produce an increase in thickness of less than
25 mm.
(v)
Tack Coat: A very light application of bituminous material applied to an existing bituminous or cement concrete surface,
used to ensure a bond between the surface being paved and the overlying course. Bituminous emulsion diluted with water
is the preferred bituminous material.
11.4.
Investory of Road and Inspection
Frequent close inspection of pavement (at least once in 3 months) is necessary to ascertain the needs of
the maintenance of the pavement. Generally, there should be a pre and post-monsoon inspections of the road to
assess the maintenance requirements. An important step towards planning ofmaintenance activities and working
out their relative priorities is to have inventory of different roads in a given area in terms of categories, physical
features, condition, structural capacity, etc. to cover the following:
(i)
Classification/category of road.
(ii)
Location of protection works, streams, CD works, etc.
(iii)
Type of surface.
(iv)
Lane width of the road
Apart from visual inspection the evaluation ofpavement may be made on the basis of deflection, roughness
etc. to decide about rehabilitation for high traffic roads.
11.5.
Types of Maintenance
The maintenance activities are divided into two categories:
(i)
Preventive maintenance
(ii)
Corrective maintenance
Preventive maintenance activities includes repairs to small sized potholes, crack sealing, maintenance of
shoulders, drainage systems, etc. Corrective maintenance includes patch repairs, surface treatments, renewal
and overlays.
11.6.
Classification of Maintenance Activities
As per IRC:82, mamtenanfce operations can be classified as
1) Routine maintenance, such as, pothole
filling, filling the cracks, etc. round the year, 2) Periodic maintenance covering renewals, which are required to
be done at periodic interval every few years, and 3) Rehabilitation and strengthening, which includes major
restoration or upgrading of pavement through reconstruction or application of overlays to correct the
structural deficiencies. Maintenance of rural roads, like, other roads, will generally include activities as given
under:
(a)
Routine Maintenance/Ordinary Repairs
(i)
Routine maintenance and up-keep of road components such as road formation, retaining walls, breast walls, culverts,
bridges, causeways, pavement and other appurtenances.
(ii)
Clearance of landslides/slips caused by rains or other natural causes in hilly terrain.

(iii)
Clearance of snow in high altitude/snow bound areas.
Periodicity of various activities under routine maintenance is given in Appendix- 1 1.1
.
(b)
Periodical Renewals
Periodical activities will include those activities which are not of routine nature and are taken up at certain periodicity,
specified or otherwise, to maintain the health of the road components. One such periodical activity
is the renewal of
wearing course of carriageway based on guidelines on life cycle and specifications of the road. List of tools and plants
frequently required for maintenance is given in Appendix-1 1.2 (A and B).
(c)
Special Repairs
Damages resulting from usage, accident, comprising of repairs and rehabilitation, which can be covered under the scope
of ordinary repairs/routine maintenance, but of a reJatively large magnitude is included as special repairs. Special requirements
of high rainfall and snow bound areas are given in Appendix-1 1.3.
11.7.
Maintenance
For maintenance purpose rural roads are classified into four types:
(i)
Unsealed roads
(ii)
Sealed roads
(iii)
Roads with rigid/RCCP
(iv)
Roads with special pavement
11.7.1.
Unsealed roads
: Following types of roads are considered under this category:
(i)
Earth Roads: These roads are constructed generally by using local material available from borrow areas along the road
alignment. These roads are not all-weather roads and get damaged heavily due to rains and traffic. They are generally
upgraded with the availability of resources.
(ii)
Gravel Roads: Gravel roads are basically earth roads covered or rolled with moorum or gravel which is available nearby.
The performance of these roads is slightly better than the earth roads. The types of defects associated with earth roads also
occur in the gravel roads.
(iii) WBM Roads: The WBM roads have the top layer of broken stone aggregate or good quality overbumt brick ballast
(when stone is not available) of suitable size. The thickness of this layer depends on the volume and type of traffic. The
thickness of the stone layer varies from 75 mm or more.
11.7.1.1.
Assessment of defects and maintenance measures
: The unsealed roads deteriorate fast as
compared to sealed. roads under traffic. Various defects and their measurements are as under
(i)
Loss of Profile, Camber and Cross Fall
(ii)
Corrugations
(iii)
Rut Formation
(iv)
Ditches and Potholes
(v)
Dust
(vi)
Erosion Gully
(i)
Loss of Profile: The camber
is measured using 2 m camber board or template
fitted with a spirit
level. The
measurement should be made on both sides of the centre line. The loose material from the sides can be scrapped
and filled in ruts, deep potholes and the profile can be re-sectioned properly with the help of spade, pick-axes, or
grader, etc. The loose material
is then rolled properly after sprinkling of water over
it.
If required, the top layer
can be provided with admixture of sand and moorum. Such a treatment would provide adequate strength to the top
layer.
It is essential that only non-plastic type of moorum should be used, at least for the top layer.
(ii)
Corrugations: Corrugations are transverse undulations located closely at regular intervals. These are formed
under dry condition due to cyclic pounding action of tyres of the vehicles crossing irregularities. Corrugations are
measured at 200 m interval along the road. The depth of corrugations
is measured with a calibrated wedge.
319



======================================================================
PAGE 349 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
(iii)
Rut Formation: The ruts are the longitudinal depressions that tend to follow the path of rolling vehicular wheels
usually associated with the settlement of pavement under traffic stress and/or the dislodging of material. The depth
of rut is measured using a straight edge and wedge scale. Measurements are made at 200 m interval along the road.
The straight edge
is placed transversely across each wheel track and the rut depth
is measured with calibrated
wedge.
(iv)
Potholes: These are irregularly shaped depressions of various sizes and depth on the road surface and result from
variety of causes, like
:
•
Poor initial compaction
•
Poor quality of material
•
Infiltration of water
•
Degradation of pavement surface
Potholes are counted and recorded for every 100 m length of road. The counts are recorded as the number of
potholes per 100 m length of the road.
(v)
Dust: One of the most common defects of the unpaved road
is dust. Dust comprising of the fine particles of soil
rises up
in the air under moving action of the vehicles. At high speeds the dust particles form a cloud of dust
thereby reducing the visibility of the driver. The dust problem
is maximum in the summer.
It is more prominent
with the earth road as compared to the WBM road.
(vi)
Erosion gully: Erosion gullies are formed on earth/gravel roads on shoulders/slopes by rainwater. Gully formation
is a complex process. The size and shape of the gully depends on the quantum of runoff. In general the gullies are
deep when the rainfall
is high and concentrated.
11.7.1.2.
Maintenance measures
: The following various measures are suggested to rectify defects of
various types of unsealed roads:
(a)
Earth Roads
Dust Control: To check the dust nuisance on the earth roads, the following measures are recommended:
•
Application of calcium chloride
in solution or
in powder form
at the rate of 0.25 to
1.25 kg/sqm depending upon the
climatic conditions.
•
Crude oil/used crude oil heated to 95°C
is applied with sprayers at the rate of 2.5 to 4
lit. per sqm.
•
Waste from sugar mills, pulp and paper mill
is applied uniformly over the road surface. The surface
is scarified to some
extent and the waste material
is thoroughly mixed. The surface
is then compacted at or near OMC.
Patch Repairs, Ruts, Potholes, Corrugations Erosion Gullies: These defects can be rectified by patching
or grading the road surface:
Depression is filled with earth of same quality as that of earth road and water is sprinkled if needed, followed by compaction
with light roller or ram with hand tamper.
(b)
Gravel Roads
:
Gravel for repair work should be at] east as good in quality as that of material
used in the construction. The suggested measures are as below:
Dust Control
: To check the nuisance of dust on the gravel roads, the following measures are
recommended.
Calcium chloride is applied in solution or in powder form at the rate of 0.25 to 1.25 kg/sqm depending
upon the climatic conditions:
Patching: The following steps should be followed:
Gravel
is stacked on the shoulder near the spot.
•
Loose material and water are removed from the patch to be repaired.
•
The sides are cut vertical to reach the sound base.
320



======================================================================
PAGE 350 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-20Q2
Patch should be filled with gravel of 100 mm thickness.
If material is too dry, water is sprinkled to facilitate compaction and the layer is then compacted by a roller or hand tamper.
Procedure is repeated as above to
fill the entire patch.
Finally the patch
is filled with gravel upto 30 mm above the road surface, spread and raked to correct shape.
Finally the layer is compacted by a roller or hand tamper to give surface slightly protruding above the surrounding level.
Loss of Shape, Corrugation, Potholes, Ruts:
These can be rectified the same way as given under,
patch repair for earth roads as above.
Renewal of Gravel Roads: Renewal of the surface is done when the surface is badly damaged due to
potholes, corrugations and ruts and
it is uneconomical to repair the defect individually. Gravel of the same
quality as used in the road construction is obtained from the borrow area.
The surface to be renewed is scarified and the material is collected. Collected material is mixed with
fresh material to the estimated quantity. To this mixed material water is added to achieve the desired water
content. The wet mixed material is then laid on the surface to the required loose thickness and then compacted
with 8 to 10 tonne roller or manually. The required camber and profile is maintained.
Resurfacing: Initial pass is made on each side of the roadway with motor grader scarifying/cutting the
surface to depth of 100 mm.
Material
is placed to required depth.
Material
is spread with a blade to the required cross slope.
Water (if needed) is sprinkled and compacted using a roller.
•
It is ensured that the cross slope of shoulder is the same as that is required.
The road surface is then cleaned.
The repairs to other defects shall be the same as for earth roads.
(c) WBM roads
: A sizeable length of rural roads falls under this category. WBM surface develops
various defects like potholes, ravelling, corrugations,
etc., as the surface undergoes various stresses due to
grinding action of solid iron-wheeled carts and also abrasion and pumping action due to fast moving pneumatic
tyred traffic. Once a portion ofWBM surface is disturbed, loose metal inflicts further damage to the adjoining
WBM surface and thus a chain of damaging effect sets in.
If the filler used for WBM surface is excessive and
plastic in nature as in wet areas and non-plastic as in dry areas, the situation gets further aggravated in adverse
weather conditions. Timely removal of the dislodged metal from the surface and blinding the surface with
appropriate material like sand or moorum can save the road from deterioration. The works to be carried out
under ordinary repairs and routine maintenance ofWBM road can be listed as under:
(a)
Collecting and stacking the picked up metal and periodically blinding the surface with binder
(b)
Filling of potholes
(c)
Re-sectioning of surface by pick and roll method.
(d)
Collecting and stacking the picked up metal and blinding the surface by screening periodically.
Periodical blinding: It is observed that particularly in dry season the metal from the WBM surface gets
dislodged. Due to traffic this loose metal abrades with the WBM layer and further dislodgement of metal takes
place.
In due course of time, the whole stretch of the road gets damaged.
It is, therefore, essential to pick-up
this loose metal and stack it properly by the roadside.
This metal can be further used for filling of potholes.
After picking up of the loose metal the surface should be covered with a thin layer of binder such as sand or
moorum. Timely provision of binder would provide good riding quality to the road surface.
321



======================================================================
PAGE 351 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Filling of Potholes: The following procedure should be followed:
(i)
The loose material in the affected spot is removed up to firm base.
(ii)
The sides of potholes are trimmed vertical and the area is shaped to rectangular as far as possible.
(lii)
The cavity is then filled-up with stone aggregates (similar in size used originally) keeping the filling slightly above the
surrounding area.
(iv)
The filler material (screenings/moorum/sand) is then spread on the filled-up aggregate.
(v)
The aggregate layer is compacted by hand rammer.
(vi)
Water is sprinkled on the hand compacted aggregate layer.
(vii) The layer is again compacted by hand ramming followed by road roller, if available.
Repairs to Ravelling by Pick and Roll Method: When the ravelling of the road surface is quite prominent
and when the funds are not adequate to carry out full-fledged periodical renewal, resurfacing by 'pick and roll
method'' is resorted to. This is a cost-effective solution for maintenance ofWBM surface of rural roads. In case
of minor ravelling, patch repairs may be carried out.
(i)
The stretch, which craves for resurfacing
is, selected which should preferably be of adequate workable length.
In this
length about 20-30 per cent of the quantity of the aggregates required for providing full-fledged renewal of WBM coat, is
collected depending on the extent of ravelling. The required quantity of moorum/screenings is also collected as a filler.
(ii)
The whole surface
is then picked up with a pickaxe to a depth of 40-50 mm as is done during resurfacing.
(iii)
The depressions, ruts and potholes are filled-up with the metal collected earlier and the surface is brought to the desired
grade and camber.
(iv)
The surface
is then rolled in dry condition with the help of 8-10 tonne roller.
(v)
The moorum/screenings are then spread over the compacted surface. The surface
is then adequately watered.
(vi)
The wet rolling of the surface is carried out.
(vii) The balance quantity of moorum
is provided as a binder to the surface.
This type of resurfacing has proved to be very cost effective.
However, this treatment may not be
adequate in heavy BC soil/clayey soils, water logged areas and sugarcane areas.
In such areas periodical
renewal may be the only way of maintaining the WBM road.
Periodical Renewal of WBM: In this process fresh WBM layer is provided over the existing deteriorated
WBM surface.
With the advent of pneumatic tyre vehicles, WBM surface deteriorates fast and the renewal of
existing surface (after every 2-3 years) become necessary. The process of periodical renewal
is the same as
that of construction of new WBM layer.
Untill now, 8-10 tonne
static rollers were being used for WBM
compaction.
If vibratory rollers are used for WBM consolidation, the
life of the renewed surface may be
increased to some extent.
The common defects, their causes and needed maintenance measures applicable to unsealed roads are
given in Table 11.1.

Repairs of Potholes:
If the bituminous surface
is defective, then shallow potholes will develop on
roads. The affected area is cut into a regular shape, preferably a rectangle with vertical sides.
All the loose
material is removed and tack coat of bitumen or bitumen emulsion is thoroughly applied on the exposed surface.
323

======================================================================

IRC:SP:20-2Q02
The premixed material prepared by mixing metal chips and bitumen is then placed layer by layer. The surface
filled-up with premixed material is kept slightly proud of the surrounding area. The surface is then compacted
by hand rammer followed by road roller, if available. The liquid seal coat or bitumen surface dressing is then
applied to seal the surface. When the potholes are deep the affected area is cut into a regular shape preferably
a rectangle with vertical sides, the loose material
is removed from the potholes and the surface is properly
cleaned with wire brush. The potholes are then filled-up by grouting method. The tack coat is applied at the
base as well as on all sides of the potholes. The stone metal of 40 mm size is then spread and compacted, and
then grouted by pouring required quantity of bitumen on
it and then key aggregates are spread over it. Again,
the required quantity of bitumen is applied to grout these layers. The material is compacted with hand rammer.
This method is resorted to fill the potholes layer by layer till the finished surface of the pothole filling stands
raised to the surrounding area. The top layer is then covered with a suitable bituminous mix and rolled by roller
into the proper camber and profile.
Rectification of Deformations
e
Depressions: The surface of the affected area should be scarified properly.
The sides of the depressions are then cut to
vertical.
The tack coat
is applied to the cut area and the depression
is filled-up with premix bituminous material.
The
filling
is then rolled properly with the power roller and the top surface
is sealed by liquid seal coat.
If the depression
is
large such as due to failure of sub-grade/base/sub-base, proper strengthening of the base or sub-base, as the case may be,
is resorted to including providing proper drainage layer, if required.
Hump or heaving: During high temperature, the bitumen from top layer flows to sides because of pressure of wheels
especially in hot weather. This results into formation of humps at the edges and depressions at the centre. Such humps are
to be removed by pick axes. The exposed surface is then properly treated with premix material and the road is brought to
desired level and then rolled properly.
•
Camber correction: The camber correction or cross slope of the pavements should be brought to the required standards
with suitable bituminous levelling course. The thickness of layer depends on the extent of correction. Separate provision
of profile correction
layer should be made
in the estimate. The camber correction must be made so that there
is no
stagnation of water on pavement surface during rainy season as
it may lead to deterioration of the flexible pavement.
Sealing of Cracks: The cracks are opened and cleaned with brush.
Tack coat of hot bitumen is then
applied under pressure to fill-up the cracks. The treated surface is then covered with premix material.
Hair
cracks can be repaired by applying slow setting cationic emulsion evenly at the rate of 5 to 9 kg/sqm. Light
tamping to the coat of bituminous emulsion is recommended.
Repairs of edge damages: Edge damages are observed in the following forms:
•
Cutting of edges
Sinking of edge strips and depressions
•
Cutting of edges takes place when the road is narrow or proper side support is not available to the edge of the road from the
well-compacted shoulders.
If the shoulders are in a bad shape or depressed, the edges are damaged badly under moving
wheels.
These are repaired by cutting the damaged edges or digging the crust under the damaged portion. The crust is
then rebuilt by grouting the metal layer and repairing the edges with premix bituminous mix. The shoulders are built-up
simultaneously with moorum and duly compacted
When edge strips sink heavily the reason could be that the shoulders are built-up in impervious material and they are
preventing draining out of water from the subgrade.
In such an eventuality the damaged portion needs to be opened up
right up to sub-base layer. The layer shall then be removed and replaced with material having good drainage properties.
Cross shoulder drains shall also be built to proper slopes to dram out sub-soil water effectively. The crust is then built-up
layer by layer after proper compaction with a power roller. The shoulders shall also be built-up simultaneously. The top
layer is then provided with BM layer, which
is further, covered with a premix carpet layer.
Ravelling: If ravelling of the road surface is observed, then emulsified bitumen is applied to the surface,
which is then topped with sand or slurry seal.
324

PAGE 354 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Bleeding: When excess quantity of binder is used in the surfacing,
it tends to work to the top and then
spread sideways. The spot or patch where bleeding has occurred becomes soft. The corrective measures are
taken by spreading fine sand or metal chips over the soft spots and ramming it by hand rammer or rolling it with
power roller, if available.
Periodical renewals: Periodical renewal consists of provision of a surfacing layer over the existing
surface of the pavement at regular interval of time so as to preserve the required serviceability ofpavement and
offset the wear and tear caused by the traffic and climate stress. Based on the experience in the country, the
following specifications are suggested for periodical renewals of rural roads:
Single coat or two coat surface dressing as per IRC:
1
7
20 mm thick premix carpet with seal coat as per IRC: 14
Mix seal surfacing as per Clause 508 of MoRT&H Specifications.
The specifications and thickness of renewal course should be such that the road surface is restored close
to its original condition as far as possible. The following broad guidelines are recommended for the type and
periodicity of renewals given in the Table 11.3.

Note:
The Table
is adopted from the Report of the Committee on Norms for Maintenance of Roads
in India, Ministry of Road
Transport and Highways, Govt, of India, October 2000.
Special Repairs: Under special repairs, the repairs, such as, filling of large potholes, side settlements,
pavement rectification, etc. are carried out. The type of treatment to be adopted for special repairs needs to be
carefully designed, so as to avoid recurrence of particular damage. Also if special repairs are carried out as per
the requirements,
it helps in sustaining the life of pavement.
Rebuilding and strengthening of existing pavement: The road pavements are designed for a particular
design life. After this period, the pavement needs to be rebuilt or strengthened. Under rebuilding, a new pavement
is constructed. In case of strengthening of existing pavement, overlays are laid over the existing road pavement
for increasing the strength of the existing pavement. The requirement of overlays for strengthening of the
existing pavement needs to be worked out on the basis of CBR method (IRC:37) of pavement design or
Benklemen Beam Deflection method (IRC:81) based on the surface deflection measured normally on sealed
roads. For these, separate IRC guidelines are available. The design of strengthening of the existing road pavement
should also include the correction to the drainage facilities of the existing pavement,
if any. The design of
strengthening of existing pavement needs to be done by an experienced road engineer.
11.73.
Semi-rigid and rigid/roller compacted concrete pavements (RCCP)
: A rigid pavement
roller compacted concrete pavement normally does not require any major maintenance, except maintenance of
joints and riding surface only, when it is meticulously designed and constructed with precision for the designed
traffic. In semi-rigid pavements and rigid/RCCP, the major defect is of riding quality, which can be maintained
by laying with the same type of concrete over poor riding surface, after applying cement paste so that a monolithic
slab can be formed. Care shall be taken to reduce the stresses at the interface (existing concrete surface shall be
just wet when a coat of cement paste as primer is applied). However, at later stages, cracks may appear due to
325



======================================================================
PAGE 355 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
many reasons.
It
is essential to examine the reasons for appearance of cracks, before any available repair
measure is adopted. The condition of a pavement structure must be known, prior to attempting its repairs or
maintenance.
To know the condition of pavement structure,
it is necessary to carry out
its structural and
functional evaluation to examine the various factors, which contribute to its failure or distress. There may be
different types of distress in cement concrete pavements. These distresses contribute to many types of cracking,
e.g., reflection cracking, corner cracking, longitudinal and transversal cracking, shrinkage cracking, elastic
cracking, map cracking, warping of slabs, scaling and spallmg of joints. In case of RCCP and semi-rigid
materials, there are very less chances of shrinkage cracking as very less quantity of water is required for the
construction of both the pavements. Methodology for the maintenance of semi-rigid pavement is almost similar
to the methodology adopted for RCCP as concrete for both of them are compacted with road roller.
Joints are the weakest part in the cement concrete slabs.
Filler and sealing materials shall be intact at
joints. During summer, sealing materials are squeezed out ofdummy contraction joints due to expansion of the
slabs.
During winter, gap opens out.
Therefore, periodic maintenance of the joints is essential at expansion
and dummy contraction joints as part of the routine maintenance work. The opened up joints are cleaned with
brush and refilled with suitable joint sealer either with hot sealing or cold sealing compound.
The cracks
developed in ngid/RCCP may be classified m two groups:
(t)
Temperature cracks which are initially hairline cracks between the dummy contraction joints of a slab and are formed due
.to warping and shrinkage stresses in the slab, and
(ii)
Structural cracks are formed due to combined wheel-loads and warping stresses.
Many factors are responsible for the deterioration of ngid/RCCP.
The causes for the same must be
examined in details for further perfection of the design and maintenance.
11.73.1.
Causes of deterioration
: Many of the causes producing deterioration may be attributed to the
following:
Material failures due to poor quality of the material used
External and internal forces of disruption in the pavement
Moisture movement
Unsupported corner
Cracking/breaking and sinking of slab corners
•
Environmental factors, sub-soil water table and rain water; and drainage failure
Salt content in natural soil and water
Harmful reactions of cement with aggregates; and salt action
Porosity, and permeability
Erosion of the base course and shoulders
Failure of the joint sealing compound
11.73.2.
Structural and functional evaluation
: Before taking-up any maintenance or rehabilitation
work of semi-rigid, ngid/RCCP pavement,
it is essential to carry out the functional and structural evaluation.
Structural Evaluation: Data is required to be collected on the aspects of residual strength also.
(i)
Sampling of hardened concrete
(ii)
Crack-width and depth estimation
Decision about reconstruction (inlay), rehabilitation, overlay, or restoration of the riding quality through
surface repairs and maintenance ofjoints has to be based on these data on distress.
326



======================================================================
PAGE 356 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
Functional Evaluation:
It takes into account the data produced by the following tests:
Rideability (RCCP riding surface is not equally even as that of conventional concrete pavement. However, as per prevailing
loading conditions in rural roads riding quality obtained with RCCP
is sufficient for the low speed vehicles)
•
Surface roughness (anti-skid braking)
Apparently sound condition and no cracking
Faulting, and rocking chunk formation
Cracking types - small, medium, large, D-type, alligator or map type
•
Alkali-aggregate reaction type
A blow up of the edge-faces at joints of the adjoining slabs
Faulting of slabs
11.733.
Maintenance procedure
: After having the pavement assessment and evaluation done,
maintenance and rehabilitation can be considered, including full-depth patching, joint sealing and sub-surface
drainage. Some suggested remedial measures may be adopted for rehabilitation of distressed semi-rigid, rigid
and RCCP. These can be:
Sealing/repairing of cracks
Repairing of spalled joints
Grout-jacking of slabs
Replacing of distressed slabs with precast concrete slabs
Patch repair: All patches before repairs, shall be prepared preferably full depths, skewed and doweled
(if the thickness of slab is more than 15 cm, dowels are generally provided at the neutral, axis in the interior of
the slab as per IRC: 15) or undercut to achieve load transfer. Mis-aligned-dowel bars create high load-transfer
stresses at the joints from one slab to the adjoining slab.
Rust on the exposed tie (if provided between two
lanes) or dowel bar is removed before repair is undertaken. Loose debris shall be removed with compressed air
or a vacuum cleaner or air pump as per the availability. A seal coat is then applied.
Repair material having
adequate pot life (10 minutes to 30 minutes) and compressive strength 10 to 20 MPa at 24 hours may be used
for filling up the void, such as, Epoxy or Magnesium Phosphate cement mortar or High Performance Concrete.
Scaling: Scaling of the slab surface is sometimes caused by poor construction techniques, such as bleeding
and over-waters in the surface when finishing and compacting.
The chloride and sulphate contents in the
concrete, required for rehabilitation or maintenance shall not be more than the values permitted in IS :45 6-2000
"Code of Practice for Plain and Reinforced Concrete".
Joint Spalling: It is general deterioration ofjoints caused by excessive compressive stresses, which may
be related to joint infiltration or to pavement growth caused by reactive aggregates.
In this case, the aggregate
expands because the reaction products occupy greater volume than the original aggregate structure. The general
type of aggregate problem can lead to serious deterioration ofjoints subject to those that react adversely with
other components of concrete mixtures. Joint spalling can be prevented by the use of high quality concrete, use
of good construction practices, and by keeping joints well sealed.
Spalls range from very small edge spalls to
large spalls reaching several inches back into the slab or down into the joint. Small edge spall may be repaired with
cement sand mortar with additives whereas for large spall, methodology adopted for blow-up repair may be used.
Joint and Crack Resealing: The resealing of in-service joints takes place in a totally different environment
from sealing on newly constructed pavements. Guidelines for joint resealing have been provided by the IRC:57
and IS:1 1433-1980.
Medium cracks of 3-5 mm width should be dry and cleaned with compressed air and then treated with
easily workable bituminous substances such as bituminous emulsion.
Similarly cracks of width ranging from
327



======================================================================
PAGE 357 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
5-25 mm should also be dry and cleaned with compressed air and then treated with hot sealing compound.
Cracks greater than 25 mm width should be dry and cleaned with compressed air and then filled by caulking
with a suitable filler material (wooden piece, sheet, small sized precast concrete blocks, jute etc.), and then
sealed with sealing compound. The step-by-step procedure for repair of cracks is given as:
Brushing: Joint must be thoroughly cleaned by brushing out loose dust, blowing out the cracks or joints with compressed
air.
Removal of tightly packed debris: When joints in an old road are to be resealed, they must first be cleaned of old sealing
compound, broken pieces of concrete etc., with a pick.
Drying of joints: Joints can be dried by a naked flame or hot air drier by fully competent workman.
Primer: The bond between sealing compound and concrete can be improved by the use of primer, a viscous and sticky
material (viscosity about 30 seconds).
It may be 80/100 penetration grade bitumen to 20 per cent kerosene.
•
Sealing compound: Filling the prepared crack/joint with suitable bitumen sealing compound.
Blow-ups:
These are compressive joint failures brought about by excessive expansion related to high
temperatures, high moisture contents, or a combination of the two.
These become likely when normal joint
movement is restricted by infiltration.
Increase in concrete volume brought about by elevated temperatures
and moisture contents create longitudinal thrust that may overcome the compressive strength of the weakest
joint in the section.
Blow-up tendency is more pronounced on pavements with long slabs where individual
joint movements are greatest.
The treatment should consist of either widening the sealing crack upto 30-40
mm to include failed area and re-sealmg or cutting out all unsound material and forming a chase of roughly
rectangular cross-section along side of the joint. Due measures are taken prior to allowing for reforming the
joint seal, placing, compacting and curing a suitable repair material. Such a repair material is often pavement
quality concrete or high performance concrete (which is generally obtained by adding 10 per cent silica fume
as replacement of cement and 1-2 per cent super-plasticizer by weight of cement m conventional concrete)
The maximum size of aggregate shall be 10 mm.
Surfaces should be primed with cement grout immediately
before application of fresh concrete.
For the maintenance, the slabs forming the joints shall be cut on each side of the blown-up joint. The
cuts are made to full depth of the slab thickness and parallel to the joint with a diamond-blade concrete-cutting
machine. The mlay space is thoroughly cleaned, oil applied on the open vertical faces of the slabs to prevent
bonding with the parent slabs and the space is filled-up with M-35 grade cement concrete. The compaction and
finishing should be done as per the normal practice.
Pumping: Closely related to joint faulting is the phenomenon known as pavement pumping. Pumping
is the process of expulsion of water from under a pavement caused by the action of repetitive wheel-loads.
Unfortunately, fine materials from the sub-base or subgrade often go into suspension and are expelled along
with water.
Solutions that are more permanent may be achieved by the restoration of load transfer and by the
provision of positive drainage systems. Corner breaks are the result of excessive pumping or overloading.
Available repair material for patching: Generally, the materials used for crack, spall and patch repair
are polyester and epoxy acrylate, early strength cements (jet set cements and admixtures), magnesia-based
cement - Magnesium Oxy- Chloride (MOC) and Magnesium Poly-Phospahate Cements (MPC), Sulphur-sand
mortars and special concrete. Methodology for repair of concrete is described in IRC:77 "Tentative Guidelines
for Repair of Concrete Pavements Using Synthetic Resins". Based on the techno-economical feasibility study
material for repair may be selected.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Rehabilitation: Five different pavement rehabilitation alternatives are generally considered quite
common.
•
Routine maintenance
•
Concrete slab restoration
•
25 mm thick premix carpet as an overlay over concrete slab
•
40 mm thick bituminous macadam overlay in special case of weak soil
•
Rehabilitation by 150 mm thick roller compacted concrete.
Maintenance shall start from the day one after the completion of the construction of a road. Once a road
is constructed it must be maintained at least to a minimum level of acceptable serviceability. The amount of
maintenance required by a well designed and well-constructed concrete road is small. More attention should,
however, be given to maintenance so that any defects can be treated
at an early stage and the amount of
deterioration reduced. To repair the deterioration especially cracks, there are advantages of using bitumen as it
enables the work to proceed more quickly and economically.
Bitumen provides a seal, which retards the
ingress of water.
11.7.4.
Special pavements
11.7.4.1.
Concrete block/interlocking concrete block pavement (CBP/ICBP)
: CBP/ICBP
failure
can mainly be in the form of excessive/uneven settlements, damage to paving block, opening up of joints due
to lack of support by edge restraint, and washing away of joint filling sand before development of inter-lock/
bond between blocks. To restore the original profile, all damaged edge restraints, if any, should be replaced
with new ones. The block surfacing should be dismantled, the base course profile should, be rectified and the
blocks should be replaced on coarse bedding sand and re-compacted. During this process, the damaged blocks
should be replaced.
In order to ensure that sufficient block of the chosen type and thickness are available for
future maintenance needs, about 5 per cent excess blocks should be produced for safe storage. Care should be
taken to ensure that the reconstructed area has slightly higher level than adjacent paved areas, so that after a few
days' traffic it achieves the same level.
11.7.4.2.
Stone-sett pavement/brick pavement
: Maintenance requirement
for stone
set/brick
pavement is very minimal. Loose edge stones/bricks, if any, have to be fixed. Depression/sinking ofpavement
should be rectified by dismantling/removal of the stones/bricks, reconstructing the subgrade/base to the required
profile, re-paving and compacting the stones/bricks on bedding sand and sealing the joints with appropriate
material.
1 1 .8.
Norms of Maintenance Cost
The maintenance of roads is classified into various sub-heads.
It includes ordinary
repairs, periodical
renewals, special repairs, flood damage repairs, maintenance and repair of major bridges, etc. Ministry of
Road Transport & Highways (MoRT&H), Govt, of India constituted various committees for framing the norms
of maintenance and repairs of different category of roads.
These study groups have suggested norms for
maintenance and repairs for various categories of roads. On similar lines many States in the country have
appointed study groups to suggest norms for maintenance and repairs to different category of roads.
For
general guidance, the MoRT&H has issued norms for maintenance of roads of different types. The norms
recommended for rural roads are given in Table
1
1 .4. However, if the States have their own norms, those can
be applied with the approval of the Engineer-in-Charge.

A scientifically planned approach for maintenance is always effective. Thus, organisational inputs for
maintenance may be in the form of gangs or otherwise as decided by the engineer. The maintenance for rural
roads can be handled using manual, semi-mechanised or fully mechanised methods. Further, the modern concept
of maintenance by contractual arrangement may also be adopted where it is appropriate.

Appendix-11.3
Special Problems of Road Maintenance in Heavy Rainfall/Snowfall Areas
(1)
Major problems for maintenance of roads in heavy rainfall areas in hilly terrain include landslides,
drainage failure, soil erosion and damage to pavements. The maintenance regime required for up
keep of the roads will be similar to the type of activities for normal roads, but with higher intensity
of effort and monitoring.
(ii)
Proper drainage of rainwater and snowmelt and protection of land surface should be the focus of
activities for prevention of landslides. Erosion of soil from both above and below the road formation
must be controlled. Prevention of deforestation of hillside, maintenance of slope stability, through
turfing, plantation, terrace benching, catch water drains, avoidance ofexcessive blasting and protective
measures like toe wall, retaining walls, breast walls, etc. are some of the recommended measures for
prevention of soil erosion and landslides.
(iii) Landslides that occur on rural roads will have to be removed manually using minor hand tools as
major earth moving equipment like dozer; shovel, etc. are not likely to be available for rural road
maintenance. Proper care should, however, be taken to ensure that the workers are not exposed to
the threat of fresh slides. A watchman should be posted to constantly monitor the behaviour of the
hill above and to warn the workers of the possibility of a fresh slip coming down.
(iv) Snowfalls in the high altitude areas can also cause landslides, avalanches, destruction to protective
structures, pavement damages, etc. besides the blockage to traffic and reduction in worker efficiency.
The main effort in clearance of snows should be to open a minimum track to enable the traffic to
move.
(v)
The side drains and the CD structures should also be cleared to enable drainage of snowmelt. The
avalanche prone areas should be identified and camping of commuters and stoppage of the traffic
near such areas should be prevented.

IRC:SP:20-2002
Appendix-11.4
Maintenance of Shoulders, Drainage Structures and Causeways
1. Maintenance of Shoulders
1.1. Properly built-up and well maintained shoulders provide lateral support to the pavement. The slow
moving vehicles, like, bullock carts or hand driven carts tend to ply over the shoulders. The shoulders are also
used for parking of vehicles.
1.2. The shoulders shall be kept free from obstructions, like, logs, shrubs, deep cuts, boulders, etc. The
wild growth on them shall also be removed from time to time. In hill roads located in high rainfall zones, the
overgrowths on both the hillsides and the valley side must be cleared twice a year, at least once before the onset
of winter. The extent of clearance area should be enough to provide six hours of sunshine to the road surface
during fair weather. It must, however, be seen that the roots of the grass are not removed, so that rains hitting
on the exposed surface do cause erosion and induce landslides. The debris of leaves, branches and stems of the
cut trees shall be cleared from the drain, pavement and the shoulder of the road and removed beyond the road
edge on the valley side by at least 2 m. The shoulders should be kept flush with the pavement edge and then
given slightly steeper slopes than the pavement to facilitate effective draining of rainwater flowing across the
pavement. The shoulders shall be maintained by filling moorum or sand and scrapping the heaved-up portion
wherever necessary.
Since the shoulders also form part of the body of the road, they shall be kept free from encroachments.
2. Maintenance of Road Furniture
2.1. Traffic signs are the principal means of conveying information about the road to the road users.
Signs which are erected at proper places and which are in good condition free from any obstruction can be
properly understood and they inspire confidence in the minds of the road users. Damaged, missing or obliterated
signs shall be replaced promptly. The signs shall be inspected and cleaned at least twice a year. At the junctions
of two or more roads proper information boards or information pillars giving information about various
destinations would be of immense help. They shall preferably be located at least 200 m ahead of the junctions
to guide the road users.
2. 2. Guard rails, guard walls, parapets of bridges, guard stone delineators, etc. shall also be maintained
properly. If they are damaged due to moving vehicles, the same shall be repaired or replaced promptly.
2.3. Kilometre/200-metre/boundary stones shall be painted twice in a year. The wild growth along the
kilmetre/200-metre boundary stones, which obstructs the visibility shall be removed. Delineators and header
stones on the curves shall be properly painted and kept in good condition to guide the driver properly at these
locations.
3. Maintenance of Cross Drainage Structures
3.1. Structures are provided for effective drainage of runoff water etc.
It is, therefore, essential that the
cross drainage structures shall be maintained effectively and
it shall be ensured those drainage elements,
waterways remain free of obstructions and retain their intended cross-sections and grades. They must function
properly so that surface water and ground water can drain freely and quickly away from the road or under the
road. Water is the worst enemy of every road element.
It can erode soil, weaken the pavement and subgrade,
and destroy shoulder and slope, even wash out cross drainage structures or bridges.
335



======================================================================
PAGE 365 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
3.2.
The parapet, railing, guard stone etc. of the CD work should be repaired if broken. These should
be properly painted for improving visibility during night.
3.3.
In the following paragraphs maintenance of mainly culverts and causeways is discussed as these
are usually used as cross drainage structures on rural roads.
3 .4.
Inspection
: Inspection of drainage system and structures shall be a routine task. If it is not possible
then the inspections should be carried out at least on four occasions. Firstly before onset ofmonsoon. Secondly,
during monsoon particularly after first flash floods, Thirdly after heavy floods, and Fourthly after monsoon.
3.4.1. Inspection before monsoon
: Following points shall be inspected:
(i)
Waterway is clear and not blocked by debris or silt
(ii)
Settlement cracks in foundations or in superstructure
(iii)
Cracks or damages in pavement
(iv)
Guide stones are properly fixed and pointed
(v,
Warning signs are placed on both sides of cross drainage structures giving clear warning that when water is flowing
above the guide stones, vehicle shall not cross the cross drainage structure
(vi)
Approaches are in sound condition and there is not erosion
(vii)
Debris arrestors if provided is properly fixed.
3.4.2. Inspection after first flash flood
: It is generally observed that during first flash flood or during
next two, three spells, there is substantial load of floating debris along with floodwater. If the vents are not of
sufficient opening, then waterway is blocked by the debris and water starts flowing on approaches or by breaching
the adjoining road sections. It is, therefore, essential to remove this blocked debris from pipe vents or waterway
immediately so that there will be minimum damages in subsequent floods. In view of this, close and repeated
inspections are essential during rainy season.
3.4.3. Inspection after heavy floods
: During heavy floods, causeways are generally over topped. This
results in heavy damages to pavement, approaches as well as scouring on down streamside of structures. In
some cases there is breaching of approaches. All these points shall be closely inspected after every heavy flood,
so that timely protective measures can be taken.
3.4.4. Inspection after monsoon
: Once the monsoon season is over, the structures shall be inspected
closely for any damage, any heavy silting or scouring to pavement damages to guide stones etc. Repairs to
these damages shall be carried out promptly.
4. Maintenance of Culverts
4.1. Defect
: Silting, Sanding and Blockage by debris
If a culvert structure is constructed too low, resulting in deposition of silt or sand. Vegetation or floating
debris gets blocked in vents of culvert. Blockage of waterway leads to ponding and heading up of floodwater,
which results in over flooding the embankment. This damages the embankment or causes breaching in roadway.
Slopes ofbed shall be corrected by Nalla training properly: Debris arrestors shall be provided on upstream side
so that floating debris will not enter the vents and there will be no blockage of vents.
It is also comparatively
easy to clear the debris from arrestors.
4.2. Defect
: Erosion of Streambed on Downstream Side
Due to flowing water or overtopping of water from culvert, the downstream side bed sometimes gets
eroded. Due to heavy scouring, the foundations of headwalls are also exposed and endangered. Due to steep
slope of bed or vents or due to inadequate waterway, the velocity of flowing water increases on downstream
336



======================================================================
PAGE 366 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
side and results in erosion below headwall, wings walls or even approaches.
This may result in collapse of
headwall or wing walls in due course of time. Protection work to the bed with properly designed apron 'at
downstream side shall be provided. Also adequate waterway shall be provided.
4.3. Defect
: Settlement Cracks in Masonry Structure
Settlement of foundations takes place due to weak founding strata. If the settlement is negligible then the
damages can be checked and repaired. But, if the settlement is major in nature, then reconstruction of structure
will be only the remedial measure.
5. Maintenance of Causeways
5.1. Defe*ct
: Cracks in Paved Surface
Settlement of fill below pavement, dislocation of stones in stone sett pavements, scouring of filler material
due to eddy currents. Damaged area shall be opened, refilled and compacted properly and then pavement shall
be re-laid.
In case of stone pavements, dislocated stones shall be re-fixed properly.
If there is scouring below
fill, then it shall be sealed properly so that there will be no damage due to eddy current.
5.2. Defect
:
Blockage of Vents Due to Debris
Floating debris block the vents. Debris arrestors shall be provided on upstream side.
5.3 Defect
: Damages Due to Overtopping of Water
Structure is not properly designed or provision of inadequate waterway or inadequate protection measures.
The geometry of the structure shall be properly designed.
Water way shall be provided in such a way that
it
shall effectively pass at least 20 per cent of high flood discharge.
The Road Top Level shall be properly
protected with pitching on upstream and downstream side as well as at top of formation extending upto high
flood level. If possible RCC Wearing Coats must be provided.
5.4 Defect
: Damages to guide stones, information boards
Due to floodwater, or due to vandalism such damages are experienced. Guide stones, information boards,
and kerbstones shall be a replaced promptly.
If neglected, when the pavement gets submerged during floods,
the edge of pavement can not be seen, more over if guide stones are missing, the depth of water on road top
level can not be judged.
This may result in serious accidents.
6. Maintenance of Drainage Features
For proper upkeep of drainage features, maintenance should take care of the following:
Camber
: A proper camber needs to be maintained for surface water. Whereas
it is found improper or
inadequate, corrective measures need to be taken. In case of unsealed roads, blading, grading and shaping may
be required. For sealed roads, a profile corrective course may be provided on the existing surface.
Shoulder and Side Slope
: The shoulder on both sides should have required outward slope starting
from the edge of pavement. Also, side slope is to be maintained at the end of shoulders, especially on high
embankments.
Longitudinal Drainage
: A lined or unlmed longitudinal dram provided in a rural road, as the case
may be, shall be cleared of any accumulated debris. The blockage of the drains by silting also may be
cleared regularly.

Introduction
Traditionally all categories of roads were funded by the government from its tax revenue in the form of
budgetary provision. Central Road Fund (CRF) had existed from
its
first approval in 1929, but could not
provide required level of resources for road development in the country. The Rakesh Mohan Committee ( 1 996)
had recommended that the major part (about 85 per cent) of the total investment required for road infrastructures
shall have to be provided from the internal resources. The Committee had also recommended setting up of a
Highway Development Fund by levying cess on petrol, diesel, private cars and commercial vehicles. Setting
up, of a Highway Saving Scheme was also recommended. In 1998-99 and 1999-2000 budgets, the Government
imposed cess or levy of Re. 1 .00 on petrol and diesel respectively which is to be utilised for road infrastructure
development through a dedicated fund, which is actually the CRF.
Both rural as well as other roads are required as efficient input to the economic activities and business for
the growth. They can no longer be treated only as the basic need for simple accessibility. Therefore, a quantum
shift is required in its quality and performance for which governmental resource alone is not sufficient. Thus,
the global phenomena of alternative methods of financing road infrastructure has been in the discussion in
India since last 15 years or so.
Rural roads being a State subject is constitutionally the responsibility of the State Governments. However,
from time to time, the Central Government has been providing central assistance for construction of village
roads (rural roads) as they are considered essential for the social and economic growth and alleviation of
poverty in rural areas. There are variety of sources under which rural roads are being funded and some of those
are described in the subsequent Sections of the Chapter.
The rural roads are handled at the level of districts. There are theoretically three mam sources of funding
for construction of rural roads: budgetary allocation, private sector and dedicated funds. There is scope for
external assistance and counter part funding through budget. Dedicated funds through area development schemes
or levies on fuel or agricultural produce are also being made use by some States.
12.2.
Budgetary Allocations
Rural roads funding has been through planned budgetary allocations for roads in all States. The problem
is that, even though the total length of rural roads (village roads and other district roads) is about 90 per cent of
all roads, there is sometimes no clear demarcation of funds allocated or utilised exclusively for rural roads. As
a result, only a small component of available funds may be earmarked for rural roads. Moreover, the budgetary
allocations for the road sector, even in the States, are very much short of the requirements in view of the
continuing financial stringency.
12.3.
Various Government Programmes
Rural roads are constructed both as normal road development activities of the Public Works Department
(PWD) and through a variety of special rural development programmes. Theses special programmes include
central assistance schemes, like, National Rural Employment Programme (NREP), Rural Landless Employment
Guarantee Programme (RLEGP), Integral Rural Development Programme (IRDP), Command Area Development
Programme (CADP), Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY), Famine Relief Programmes, Tribal Area Development
Programmes, and also states' special employment programmes. There are several other schemes floated by
339



======================================================================
PAGE 369 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
States and Centre from time to time to improve the village connectivity. There are Zilla Panshad fund, DPDC
funds as well as funds for roads from other Departments like Tourism, Forest, Industrial Development are also
used for making roads. Currently, some additional funds became available out of the Central schemes such as
Jawahar Gram Samndhi Yojana
(JGSY ; and Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS). There is usually a matching
contribution by the State for such schemes. The main objectives of some of these programmes include generation
of additional employment opportunities m rural areas. The people below the poverty line are the mam target
groups. Quite often, these funds are used for rural roads also, but since the primary aim has been to generate
employment rather than creating durable assets, the potential for creation of durable rural roads under these
schemes has been essentially limited. Further, if they do not receive any maintenance funding, they deteriorate
fast.
Recently, the Central Government has taken a bold initiative of crediting an amount of additional excise
duty of Re. 1.00 per litre on petrol since 2.6.1998 and on diesel since 1.3.1999 to Central Road Fund. Of this
fund, a portion of the levy comprising 50 paise per litre on diesel is meant exclusively for constructing rural
roads. The Honourable Prime Minister has announced that
all habitations with population above 1000 be
connected with all-weather roads by 2003 and those with population above 500 by the year 2007. This programme
is known as Pradhan Mantn Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and
is being managed by the Ministry of Rural
Development and implemented by the States.
12.4.
Community Base Pgoramme
There are schemes for construction and maintenance of roads by the district authority where the village
people build their own roads with the material, machinery and skilled manpower given by road authority and
with
all unskilled manpower, contributed by the village. Andhra Pradesh provides a good example of this,
which
is called Janmabhumi programme. The State and Central Govt, also provide earmarked funds to
each MLA and MP for development of their constituency. A part of these funds is also often used for building
roads.
12.5.
Financial Institutions
In practice, there are very few private sector funding possibilities available for rural roads because of the
usual 'public goods" argument, which is centred on the question of 'who will pay for it ?' National Bank for
Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) does make funds available for rural road construction as part
of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF).
It is a low interest long term loan. Some States have also
approached external aid agencies, such as, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, etc., to fund the development
of rural areas including rural roads. Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Onssa, and some other States
have availed such funding for their rural roads. These multilateral banking institutions have also shown
interest
in providing financial assistance for rural roads as a part of overall agricultural development
package.
12.6.
Market Committee *'ee
Some States levy cess on food grains through their market Committees and proceeds utilised, among
other things, for construction of rural roads and their maintenance. For example, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan,
and Uttar Pradesh have been using this mechanism of taxing agricultural produce marketed through Mandis to
provide additional facilities in terms of new Mandis as well as rural roads. In sugar cane belt, the rural roads are
sometimes constructed and maintained by Sugar Factories. Other States are also considering the proposals for
creation of dedicated funds through collection of cess or levies for providing better rural development and
marketing infrastructure including rural roads.

12.7.
Estimation of Costs
There are tremendous variation of soil conditions, terrain, as well as availability and quality of construction
materials across the States of the country. Therefore, a standard cost estimate cannot be suggested for the rural
roads. Appendix-12.1 provides the general ideas about the range of costing of the materials and road construction
specifications in various parts of the country. This would essentially mean that there will be variation in the
cost of the construction. Thus, only to give an idea of the basic costs of the various materials and construction
specifications, a baseline information on costs has been indicated in the Appendix which may provide guidance
to the States. However, these costs may not be realistic for any one or more States as the actual costs can be
more or even less than what is indicated here.
For the rural roads programme, the States could not provide much rigor in their implementation due to
shortage of funds. Thus, the project preparation and detailed estimates etc. were not considered necessary
earlier for construction of rural roads in most States. However,
it will be advisable to prepare all these project
related information/documentation in the interest of creating durable assets,
i.e., rural roads. Appendix-12.2
provides an example of preparing estimate for a kilometer of rural road. Further, Appendix- 12.3 provides an
example of measurement sheet.

Appendix-12.1
Estimation
of Cost
12.1.1.
General
The Appendix aims to provide a broad idea of the tentative costs for various types of roads, which are
likely to be built as rural roads. In addition to the initial costs of construction, some idea of the maintenance
costs
is also given in accordance with the norms recently revised by the Ministry of Road Transport and
Highways, Govt, of India. The costs considered in this Chapter for various materials and work items do not
generally cover the transportation costs (cost of the lead distance). Also, the basic costs of the materials are
considered without any special taxes, etc. which may be applicable in certain States. The costs do not include
tender premium or contractor's profit as well as organisational and management charges for works. These cost
are not for adoption in any works, but simply to provide relative idea of costs for various materials and components
of the road. The current schedule of rates applicable in the States shall be adopted by the executing agencies
and this Appendix will guide the engineers to see the rationale of the rates adopted by them. The cost ranges
given in this Appendix is based on current schedule of rates prevailing in some of the States.
12.1.2.
Basic costing
Three broad types of subgrade soils may be found which will influence the design, and therefore, the cost
of the pavement.
Poor soils, with CBR of 2-3 or less
Medium soils, with CBR of 5-7
Good soils, with CBR higher than 7
Soil conditions have a great influence on design thickness, particularly of a flexible pavement. However,
they do not significantly influence the thickness of a concrete or semi-rigid pavement. Poor soil, of course, may
be upgraded or improved to reduce design thickness and cost of pavement. The costs given here are only for
guidance and may differ from site to
site. There may be variations in the different parts of the same State
_
depending on geological and geographical conditions.
Rural roads are generally low trafficked road; typical single lane rural road will have traffic intensity 20-
150 commercial vehicles per day as observed traffic with growth rate 6 per cent per annum. The design life is
taken as 10 years in the Manual.
The pavement thickness details will then be arrived at by following the
procedure as detailed in Chapter 5
on Pavement Design.
Out of the granular thickness designed various
alternatives can be generated based on equivalencies and may be adopted (as given
in Chapter 5).
Thus,
choices can be exercised to save cost of the construction.
12.13.
Cost of aggregates
:
The costs of aggregates in different zones including hilly regions are
given below for guidance. These are as per the MoRT&H Report of Committee on Norms for Maintenance of
Roads in India, October 2000 and given in Table 12.1.1.

Cost of work items
: As an example, for the calculation of the rates for work items, the cost of
stone and other items as applicable to zone II is considered. The cost of some of the items required for estimating
cost of various components of alternate pavement specifications are computed as range as given in Table
12.1.4. These ranges are computed based on the schedule of rates prevailing in various states.

Total cost of road
: The total cost of the road shall be combination of various layers ofpavement
as given in the Table
1 2. 1 .5. In the Table, the cost analysis does not include the cost of shoulders and drainage
system. The shoulders are generally constructed with same material as that of subgrade. The top 100 mm thick
layer comprises ofmoorum or sand. The cost of shoulder is considered as Rs.0.5 to Rs.0.7 lakh per km. Similarly
343



======================================================================
PAGE 373 of 383
======================================================================
IRC:SP:20-2002
the cost of surface drainage system in normal case is estimated as Rs.0.1 to Rs.0.15 lakh per km. Hence, with
cost of shoulders and drainage system, the total cost of the road may work out to as m the Table 12.1.6. These
are for guidance only. The exact cost needs to be worked out on the basis of schedule of rates for the area.

Maintenance cost of rural roads may vary significantly depending
upon the type of treatment, rainfall, terrain, intensity and composition of traffic. The maintenance cost of rural
roads for different types of roads is given in Table 12.1 .7. These figures are based on the Report of Committee
for Norms of Maintenance by MoRT&H. The maintenance cost (Ordinary Repairs) ranges from Rs.22,000 to
Rs. 80,000 per year per km.

Life cycle cost
: The life cycle cost includes the cost of construction and maintenance of the
road for a specified period. Thus the construction cost from Table 12.1.6 and cumulative maintenance cost
taken from the Table 12. 1 .7 for the chosen period of life, together gives the life cycle cost. Therefore, it will be
sometimes useful to examine the life cycle cost of an alternative rather than the initial cost of construction
alone.
12.1.12.
Holistic approach
: There are various schemes of State Governments and Central Government
that are pouring in resources for the development of rural areas, particularly for rural roads.
However, these
various schemes are being implemented by different agencies with fragmented approach of planning.
It
is
necessary to adopt an integrated approach to funding of rural roads which would take into account not only the
financing but also issues of planning and governance so as to implement a common development plan.
At present, rural roads is a district level scheme. Each district is expected to carve out sufficient allocation
to the rural roads programme from the district annual plan. The size of district annual plan is dependent on the
area, population and other factors in the district. However, considering the total size of the district annual plan,
rural roads get a meagre share from the annual plan. This results into shortage of funds for rural roads in most
of the districts. Besides, there are a multiplicity of schemes as mentioned in this Chapter that have various
objectives, and the various agencies involved in construction of the rural roads as part of those schemes do not
implement the same overall plan.
The District Development Councils review the priorities and decide the schemes to be undertaken within
the available resources, and roads generally get the last priority. It is recommended that a master plan of rural
roads for a district be prepared with development needs for at least 5-10 years. The key guiding principle will
be to have some kind of "Umbrella Agency" so that monetary thrust is directed into a comprehensive master
plan approach in pre-planned manner instead of the funds being spent in multiple fragmented efforts. The
administrative and financing responsibility of rural road is currently at the district level. The District Councils
need to ensure that all such funds earmarked for rural roads by different agencies under different schemes are
made available in a common pool for the implementation of the same master plan.
