TENTATIVE GUIDELINES FOR STRUCTURAL STRENGTH
EVALUATION OF RIGID AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Pavement evaluation, in
its
most common
connotation,
implies the assessment of residual or available structural strength of
the pavement.
Evaluation is normally required either in connection
with checking the
adequacy of the existing pavements for increased
design loads, or working out suitable
overlay
designs to
restore or
enhance
their
structural
capacity.
Evaluation
is
also
needed
to
check the quality of a new construction.
1.2.
As regards structural evaluation of rigid pavements while
both direct load test and indirect reverse design
methods are in use
in
the
country,
no guidelines
about
the
criteria and methods of
evaluation have so far been laid down.
It is with a view to provid-
ing a standard basis for evaluation of
the
rigid
airfield pavements,
both in respect of test procedures
and
the
evaluation criteria,
that
these guidelines have been prepared.
Suggestions are
also included
for simplifying the test procedures where
it
is
felt
that this could be
done without sacrifice of accuracy.
These guidelines were approved by the Cement Concrete Road
Surfacing Committee (personnel given below) in
their meeting held
at Hyderabad on the 5th January, 1976.

These were then processed by the Specifications and Standards
Committee in
their
meeting
held
at New Delhi on the 16th May,
1977 subject to
certain modifications
which on the
authorisation
of
the
Committee
were
carried
out
by Dr. R.K. Ghosh, R.P. Sikka,
B.R. Govind and Lt. Col. Avtar Singh, assisted
by Y.R.
Phull, M.
Dinakaran and K. Arunachalam.
These were later approved by the
Executive Committee
through
circulation and
the Council in
their
meeting held on the 28th October, 1979.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The
standard
describes
the
procedure
for
structural
evaluation
of
rigid
airfield pavements by two alternative methods,
namely
the
"direct
load
test
method"
and the
"indirect reverse
design method" which are commonly adopted in the country.
2.2.
The
"direct
load
test
method"
provides
actual
load
carrying
capacity of
the
pavement
taking
into account
the inter-
action between various
pavement layers,
extent of
load transfer
at
joints etc., as actually obtained at site. The "reverse design method"
on the other hand,
involves
indirect
computation
of the pavement'
strength
based
on
evaluation of
the individual
design parameters.
Since the
interaction between different parts of the in-service
pave-
ment cannot be taken into account in
the case
of
indirect method,
and as the
inherent
approximations
in
the
method also affect the
evaluated strength value, from
the point
of accuracy of
evaluation
the
direct
load
test
method
has
a
definite edge over the indirect
method and
is as such to be preferred.
2.3.
The actual choice of the method
in individual
cases will,
however, be dictated by
other
considerations
as
well,
for instance
the
availability
of
suitable
load
testing
reaction
frame,
testing
facilities, time available for the
study, the period
for which
airfield
can be closed to traffic etc. For important works, every effort should
be made to arrange direct load tests.
However,
when
facilities
for
this are not available, a
reasonably
approximate assessment
of the
pavement structural strength
can be had from
the indirect method.
Even
if the reverse design
method
has
to be adopted,
it would be
worthwhile conducting a few direct load tests for comparison. These
tests could be done at locations where indirect tests are
proposed to
be carried
out,
so
that the
results could be tied together to
assess
actual interaction of the pavement components obtaining at site.
2.4.
Both
in
the
case
of
direct and indirect methods, after
field data have
been
collected,
the
structural
capacity
of airfield
pavements can be noted either in terms of LCN (Load Classification
2



======================================================================
PAGE 7 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 764979
Number) or LCG (Load
Classification
Group) method.
While the
former is based on corner loading, the latter is
for
internal loading
conditions.
Joints in airfield pavements in the
country are in most
cases not provided with dowel bars.
For these situations, the corner
loading
condition
is
more
appropriate.
As
such the LCN rating
system
is
considered
more
suitable for
conditions existing
in
the
country, and the procedures described in the guidelines are based on
that system.
2.5.
The procedures recommended are intended for
rigid air-
field pavements in sound structural condition.
If the pavement has
any localised defective spots, such
locations should not be
selected
for overall structural evaluation, as this might
result in gross under
rating of the pavement.
Such defective spots should be grouped to-
gether and
separately investigated
to evaluate
the reasons
for the
defects, as remedy
for these may
be in measures
like mud jacking,
improvement of drainage, removal and replacement etc.,
and not in
superimposition of a thick overlay which may provide only temporary
relief.
3.
DIRECT LOAD TEST METHOD
3.1.
General
The direct load test method essentially involves the application
of static loads
through
a
rigid plate on
the existing pavement and
noting the response in the form of deflections/strains.
Based on the
data collected, the
structural
capacity of
the
pavement
is rated
in
terms of LCN through the use of
appropriate
charts.
This method
has the advantage that
it
gives the
actual load
carrying capacity of
the pavement at the time of test, taking the different interactions into
account.
Since the results obtained by this method
are
dependent
on test conditions, such as the time of testing, location of test points
etc,
it is necessary to follow a common procedure
to determine
the
critical load carrying
capacity
of
the
pavement.
t
Guidelines with
regard to these conditions are given below:
(1)
Period
of
testing: The
period
of testing should be such
that
it
is critical for
foundation
strength
(i.e. when the
foundation
saturation
is
at maximum
or
near-maximum)
as
well as for load
transfer especially in the
case of dummy joints (i.e. when the
mean
pavement temperature
is minimum during the year).
Early
winter,
following the rainy season, can be a good working compromise from
these considerations.
If it becomes necessary from other
considera-
tions
to conduct
the
tests at any other period,
appropriate
adjust-
ments,
based
on
actual
tests or engineering judgement, should be
3



======================================================================
PAGE 8 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 76-1979
applied
in
respect
of
foundation
strength
and
degree of load
transfer.
(2)
Locations of test:
In
the case of undowelled
pavements,
50 per cent tests should be carried out at the junction
of
transverse
expansion joint and longitudinal construction joint, and the remain-
ing at free slab corner at the junction of transverse and
longitudinal
expansion
joint.
For
pavements
having
dowelled
transverse ex-
pansion joints, however,
the
junction
of longitudinal expansion or-
construction joint and the transverse dummy joint may be chosen as
the test locations.
(3)
Number
of
test
locations
and selection of test sites: For
airfield evaluation one test
is recommended for every 60 m length in
case
of
runways
and
60-90 m
length
in case
of taxi tracks
and
aprons.
In
general,
a
total
of
15-20
determinations
may
be
required for proper
statistical
evaluation
of the
test
data.
These
recommendations may be
treated as general broad
guidelines only,
and depending on the site conditions
the test
locations
and
frequ-
ency may be left to the discretion of the Engineer-in-Charge.
(4)
Time of testing:
Since tests are conducted on
slab corners
which are the most vulnerable portions of the slab, as far as possible
the tests should be
done at
the
most critical
time of the day when
the load carrying capacity of the corners will be the minimum from
considerations
of pavement
warping, viz. early hours in the morn-
ing.
3.2.
Test Procedure
3.2.1,
General: The
test
is performed on
selected pavement
corner by loading
it through 45 cm
diameter plate
and
measuring
deflections at the top of the loaded slab corner and
the three adjoin-
ing slab corners.
The loading frame for use in the tests should be of
a capacity 50 per cent higher than the equivalent single
wheel
load
corresponding toihe original design LCN value of the pavement.
A
thin
layer
of
fine
sand
or plaster of
paris may be used
below the test plate, where required, to ensure fulT contact with the
pavement.
Also a seating load of 3000 kg may be applied
initially
for about 10 seconds and released before commencement of the test
proper.
Basically two procedures (I and II) are available
for
the
test
within the scope of LCN method viz. load test well beyond cracking
and load test upto imminent cracking.
A
third
alternative, that is
testing
upto
standardised
value
of
working deflection to
directly
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 76-1979
obtain the working load,
is also suggested as a modified and simpler
procedure (III) requiring much
less test loads as
compared
to
the
first two alternatives.
While any of the first two procedures may be
adopted independently for the test,
the
third
procedure
based
on
working load deflection may be adopted in
conjunction
with
either
of the first two procedures.
This procedure will be specially useful
where either the testing
is to be done expeditiously or
where crack-
ing of slabs due to testing is to be avoided.
3.2.2.
Procedure I.
Load test beyond
cracking:
In
this
pro-
cedure, in
addition
to
the
deflection gauges on slab
corners, four
additional
deflection
gauges
are located along the
bisector
of
the
loaded corner angle as shown in Fig.
1.
Load
is
applied
in
equal
increments of 3000 kg and deflection readings taken after
each load
increment.
After
occurrence
of
cracks, the gauges
on
the
main
slab beyond the corner crack will register a lower or no increase
in
deflection with increase in load, while in case of other gauges includ-
ing gauge
1
(Fig.
1) there will be a
sudden
increase.
As
soon
as



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 76-1979
this change in
deflections
is
noticed,
the
test
is
stopped, and the
load corresponding to the point of change taken as the failure
load.
As per the standard LCN procedure, safe working load
is obtained
by
applying
a factor
of
safety
of
1.5 for non-channelised
traffic
areas and
1.8 for channelised traffic areas.
3.2.3.
Procedure
II.
Load
test
upto
imminent
cracking:
In
this procedure,
instead of
deflection gauges four mechanical
strain
gauges (Fig. 2) are used along the bisector of the
loaded
corner
to
Fig.
2
Arrangement of strain gauges for detection of crack
incidence for corner load test in airfields
detect the imminence of cracking, so that the test load may be taken
as close as possible to
the point of failure without
actually
causing
a crack.
As soon as the
reading
on
any
one strain
gauge
starts
increasing rapidly relative to the adjacent gauges, the corresponding
load
is taken as the failure load and the safe working load
obtained
by applying a factor of safety of 1.5/1.8 as in procedure
I.
In case of both the above procedures
I and II,
if the pavement
does not show any sign
of
cracking upto the full
capacity
of
the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 76-1979
loading
frame,
the
safe
working load can be calculated
from
the
maximum applied load.
3.2.4.
Procedure
III.
Load
test
upto
a
standard
working
deflection:
In this procedure, a working deflection value
is
determi-
ned for each specific case by
conducing
failure load
tests
at
3-4
locations only
and
noting
the
failure
deflection.
The
working
deflection
is obtained by applying a factor of safety of 1.5/1.8 to
the
average of the observed failure deflections.
This
procedure
is
based on the fact that the
load
deflection
curves for such
pavement
tests
are
practically
linear
within
the
failure load limit, and hence
it
is possible to apply
factor
of
safety
of 1.5/1.8 to faiiure deflection instead of the failure load.
The
load
corresponding
to
the
safe
working
deflection
is taken as the safe
working load.
Since the value of failure deflection for
a pavement
is affected by factors such as slab thickness, concrete strength,
area
of loading, subgrade
stiffness,
etc.,
it
is not possible
to
stipulate a
single value
of
failure
deflection.
Because
of this,
it
is necessary
that in every case atleast 3-4 tests must be carried out to
determine
the failure deflection
as the basis for further evaluation.
This procedure not only ensures that the
pavement
does
not
get cracked, but also smaller
loads
and less
time
are
needed
for
completion
of
the
test.
Only
four deflection gauges
at
the
four
corner tips are required for the test and no
additional
deflection or
strain
gauges
are
needed.
In
this
deflection-based
procedure,
observations
should
be
taken
at
equal
deflection
increments
of
0.15-0.25 mm to obtain atleast 5-6 readings within the recommended
working deflection range.
Note
:
The possibility of an occasional
erratic
result
cannot
however be
ruled out, due to factors such as subgrade pumping, poor local drai-
nage unusually weak spots in
foundation
or the
slab etc.
In such
cases, when the slab cracks during the test, the working load should
be obtained
as
per
procedure
I
by applying a factor of safety of
1.5/1.8 to the failure load.
3.2.5.
Illustrative load
deflection/strain
curves
for the three
procedures are shown in Fig.
3.
§
3.3.
Adjustment for Load Transfer
3.3.1.
The load carrying capacity of
a slab
evaluated by the
direct load test method includes a
component
due
to load transfer
at the joints.
This component
will
always
be
available
if the test
is carried
out
at
the
minimum
temperature
the
slab
is
likely to

attain.
As such if the load test is conducted
when
the slab
is at its
minimum temperature, no correction for load transfer
need
be
ap-
plied.
However,
if the test is conducted when
the slab temperature
is higher than the minimum attainable in service,
the evaluated load
capacity should be reduced by a suitable
correction
factor
to
take
care of the possible reduction in load transfer when the
slab tempe-
rature falls down to the minimum value.
3.3.2.
According to the current
state
of knowledge,
adjust-
ment for load transfer
is an arbitrary
process
based
on experience.
It will be, therefore, desirable to
conduct
the
load tests during the
coldest part of the year as far as
feasible
so
that the need for load
transfer adjustment
is
obviated.
Where
this
is
not
possible,
the
correction factor to be applied may
be
evaluated
on
the following
lines.
The load transfer actually available during
the
time of test
is first determined. The load transfer which will always be available
even when
the slab is at
its minimum temperature
is then assessed.
The correction factor
is taken to be the difference between the two.
3.3.3.
The load transfer actually available during
time of the
test can
be
evaluated
by
assuming
that
its magnitude
is directly
proportional to the measured
deflection
of
the
respective corners.
If SI, S2, S3 and S4 are
the
recorded
deflections
of
gauges
1,2,3
and 4 respectively (see Fig.
1
for position
of
the
gauges),
the load
transfer will work out

The minimum
lead
transfer
which
will
always
be
available
is assumed as the
average
of
the
lowest
quartile
of the
observed load transfers subject to a maximum
value
of
20 per cent
(see foot note* for procedure).
If the measured
load
transfer
is

transfer y per cent,
the
corrected
load capacity will
be
[ 100-(x

of
the measured load
capacity.

The above
applies
to
cases
where
the
joints are not
provided with load transfer devices.
If the pavement contains load
transfer devices like dowels or continuous
reinforcement,
the com-
ponent ofload transfer will be higher and most of it will be available
*Note
: A frequency distribution

is
prepared for the measured load
transfers.

Some reduction should however
be anticipated, to account for
which
it
is
recommended
that a

Knowing the safe working
load
and

of the test plate, the LCN
rating for pavement of

test location
may be obtained from the standard LCN chart vide Fig. 4.

For assessing the safe LCN rating of
the
pavement as
a whole, the safe working load should be calculated
statistically for
a confidence level of
1
in
15, by subtracting
1.5
times the standard
deviation from the average of
the
working
loads
calculated
with
respect to individual
tests.
This value should then be
examined in
relation
to individual
LCN test values to see whether any test locations have exceptionally
low values, so that the same may be considered
separately
for
ap-
propriate remedial measures.

An illustrative example of calculation of safe LCN
for
an airfield runway
is given
in Appendix-1.

INDIRECT REVERSE DESIGN METHOD
4. 1
.
General
Where direct evaluation by load
tests
is
not
possible due to
any reason, indirect
evaluation
may
be
done
by
reverse
design
method.
This method requires the
same basic information
for evalua-
ting
pavement structural
strength,
as
is
required
in
the
case
of
design for
a new pavement
(with
the
obvious
exception of design
wheel load, and addition of actual pavement slab thickness),
viz:
(i)
Flexural strength of concrete in the pavement
(ii)
Foundation strength in terms of k-value
(iii)
Maximum temperature differential over pavement depth.
It
is, however, necessary to determine
the
actual
strength
of
con-
crete and pavement foundation by
appropriate
tests.
Selection
of
test locations for this purpose should be on the same lines as sugges-
ted in para 3.1.
However,
if effects of fatigue are also
to
be
evaluated, a few
additional test locations may be selected along the outer edges which
are subject to much less traffic intensity.
4.2.
Test Procedure
*
4.2.1. Concrete strength: Either beam or core samples may
be
recovered from the test locations for determination of concrete stren-
gth.
While
it
is preferable
to
have
beam
samples
for
direct
determination
of
flexural
strength,
core
samples
may have
to be
resorted to many a time from considerations of expediency, available
equipment, time available
for
investigation,
or
the
need
to
keep
damage to the pavement from sample recovery to the minimum.
Concrete samples, whether beam or core, should
be
carefully
examined for quality of compaction, and
their
dimensions
accura-
tely measured.
Beam samples may be tested in flexure
using
third
point loading, and concrete flexural strength determined
there from.
For cores,
crushing
strength
results
should
be corrected
for
h/d
ratio
before
determination
of
corresponding
cube
compressive
strength.
The crushing strength of cylinders with h/d ratio between
1 and 2 may be corrected to correspond
to standard h/d
ratio
of 2
by multiplying with the correction factor obtained from the following
equation:
11



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 76-1979
/=0.11 « + 0.78
Where /= correction factor
n—h\d ratio
The diameter "d" of cores recovered should not be
less
than
10 cm
for
concrete
with maximum
aggregate
size
of
10 mm
and not less than 15 cm for concrete with maximum
aggregate
size
of 40 mm.
Cube compressive strength may be
taken
as
1.25
times
the
corrected cylinder crushing strength.
Conversion from
cube
com-
pressive to flexural strength may be done
using the
chart
given

4.2.2.
Foundation strength:
Foundation
strength
in terms
of
its A>value
is
normally
determined
directly by
conducting
plate
bearing tests on the foundation on which the slab rests (which could
be earth subgrade, or a sub-base if provided) after removing sections
of pavement slab.
The
test
could be
conducted
on a 30 cm
dia.
Plate
and
converted
subsequently
to
the
standard
/c-value
for
75 cm diameter plate by the approximate correlation:
&75 =0.5 k 3o
where & 75 and k 30 are
the
^-values for 75 cm and
30 cm
diameter
plates respectively.
It should,
however, be noted that this
correla-
tion
is based on homogenous foundation conditions, and
in the case
of layered
construction
i.e. when
the
test
is conducted on a
sub-
base, the smaller plate will give a greater weightage to
the
stronger
top layer.
In such cases, direct conversion to 75 cm plate value by
the
above
correlation
somewhat
over-estimates
the
foundation
strength and should be regarded as very approximate only.
After conducting the test, the sub-base may be
removed
upto
the subgrade level, noting
its type and thickness,
and a
plate
bear-
ing
test
conducted
to
determine
subgrade
/c-value,
if considered
necessary.
If
direct
determination
of foundation /c-value
is not possible,
an approximate
indirect
assessment can be made by conducting in-
situ CBR test on the subgrade.
From this, an
approximate idea
of
the
subgrade
fc-value
may
be
obtained
using
the CBR
fc-value
correlation given in Table
1.
If any
sub-base
is present over the subgrade,
due
allowance
should
be made
for
increase
in the foundation Zr-value.
For
this
purpose, the charts given in Fig. 6 may be made use
of.

4.2.4.
Slab thickness:
Slab thickness may
be
determined
by
direct
measurement
of height
on core or beam samples
recovered
from the pavement slab for concrete strength determination.
4.3.
Number of Test Locations and Selection of Test Sites
Same considerations will apply
in this case as
for
the
Direct
Load
Test
Method.
Provisions
of
para
3.1 should
therefore
be
followed in this respect.
4.4.
Analysis of Concrete/Foundation Strength Test Data
The distribution of test data should
be studied
carefully
both
for concrete and foundation strength to see
if the
pavement
section
under investigation could be divided into zones of distinctly different
concrete and foundation strengths, in which case "typical"
strength
values
should
be
separately
worked
out
for each zone.
In
case
such sub-division
is not possible, the strength data may be examined
on an overall
basis.
It
is
suggested
that the "typical" strength values
should
be
arrived at from actual
test
data for ensuring a confidence
level
of
1
in
15.
This can be worked
out by reducing the average of all the
strength
test
values by
1.5
times
their
standard
deviation.
The
dasign
strength
values may
thereafter
be
obtained by applying a
factor of safety of -1.1
to the typical values..
4.5.
Determination of Pavement Structural Strength
4.5.1.
Pavement
design
procedure
to be
adopted: The LCN
method for airfield pavement design may
be
used.
Knowing pave-
ment thickness, concrete flexural strength
and
foundation
&-value,
the rated LCN for the pavement can be read directly from the chart,
Fig.
7.
4.5.2.
Allowance for load transfer: As in the case of evalution
by direct load test (see para 3.3),
it
is necessary to
assess
the
mini-
mum
load transfer
that
will
be
available
at any location
in
the
pavement.
The critical locations from this consideration
would
be
the same as those recommended
in para 3.1;
Contribution
to
load
capacity
due
to load transfer may be
assessed
by
conducting
actual
load
tests,
noting
deflections
of
adjacent slabs upto anticipated design
equivalent single wheel
load
for the pavement.
Only a limited number of tests on
typical joints
would be adequate.
(Similar tests can also be conducted
to
assess
the load transfer capacity of typical cracks in
the
pavement).

test will however, have to be
conducted in the coldest
part
of
the
year when
load
transfer
is
at
its
critical minimum; otherwise
a
correction factor will have
to be applied as explained
in para 3.3.
The total assessed load carrying capacity
of the
pavement at
any location shall be obtained by combining the individual slab load
carrying capacity, as calculated in para 4.5.1., with the load transfer
capacity at joints.
4.5.3.

evalua-
tion of an airfield pavement by reverse
design
method
is

Correct ion for Load Transfer
(1) Calculation of Minimum Load Transfer
Since all the values obtained are less than 20 per cent, and none of them is
zero, taking the average of
all these values, the level
to which the higher
values of load transfer will get reduced = 10.0 per cent.

10.0, 6.8,
10.0,
10.0, 8.9, 6.7, 8.7
From these values, x=8.95%, a = 1.32%
Most probable min. available load transfer
=2-1.5 a=8.95-1.5xl.92
= 8.95-1.98=6.97%
(2) Modified Pavement Slab LCN taking into account Load Transfer
From Fig. 4, for tyre pressure of 10 kg/cm2
, equivalent
single
wheel
load
(ESWL) corresponding to LCN 40 (without load transfer) = 13000 kg.

Accounting for load transfer,
Actual load carrying capacity of
the pavement = 1 3,000 x

Corresponding LCN (from Fig. 4) =42.
