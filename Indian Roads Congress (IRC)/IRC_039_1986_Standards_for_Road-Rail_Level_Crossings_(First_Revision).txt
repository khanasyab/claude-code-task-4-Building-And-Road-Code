STANDARDS FOR ROAD-RAIL LEVEL CROSSINGS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Road-rail
level crossings, however, adequately designed
and constructed, are accident prone. However, where it is not possible
from
engineering and economic
considerations
to provide road
over/under bridges, and level crossings have to be provided, the
standards given here under should be followed in the interest of
maximum safety.
1 .2. These standards are intended primarily to be applied to new
construction or where an existing crossing is being reconstructed.
Existing level crossings need not be altered merely to
suit these
standards.
1.3. The
draft of this
standard had been approved by
the
Specifications and Standards Committee at its meeting held at New
Delhi in September 1 96 1 . Thereafter as suggested by the Committee,
it was forwarded to the Roads Wing of the Ministry of Shipping and
Transport
for
finalizations
in
consulation
with
the
Ministry of
Railways. The Railways gave their concurrence to the standard in
September 1970, after effecting slight changes in the original text.
The draft standard was subsequently approved for publication by the
Executive
Committee
and
the
Council
at
their
meetings
held
respectively in November and December 1970. Provisions of this
Standard have been separately circulated by the Railway Board
among the different Zonal Railways.
1.4. On the request of the Indian Roads Congress,
the
first
revision has been made by the Ministry of Transport, Department of
Surface Transport (Roads Wing) after obtaining the comments from
the Ministry ofTransport, Department ofRailways. Besides the minor
editorial changes a fresh clause 21
"Safety Measures to Minimise
Accidents" has been added in the revision.
2. LOCATIONS
As far as possible, road-rail level crossings should not be located
near railway stations and marshalling yards. If this is unavoidable,
they should be located beyond shunting limits.

IRC: 39-1986
3. CLASSIFICATION OF LEVEL CROSSING
3.1.
Level crossings shall be classified as below:
Special
A class
B class
C class
For vehicular traffic
D class for cattle crossings and footpaths
3.2. The
classification of a
rail-road
level
crossing
shall be
settled mutually by the Railway and Road Authorities keeping in view
the class of the road, visibility conditions, the volume of road traffic
and the number oftrains passing over the level crossing.
4. CATEGORIZATION OF ROADS
For the purpose of this standard, the roads shall be categorized as
under:
(i)
Class I Roads
(a)
National Highways;
(b)
State Highways;
(c)
Important roads within municipal towns
; and
(d) Road in and around towns where road and rail traffic is
heavy.
(ii)
Class II Roads
(a) Major and Other District roads;
(b) Unimportant roads within municipal towns;
(c) Roads
within
non-municipal
towns
including
those
within shunting limits of its railway stations; and
(d)
Other surfaced roads.
(iii) Class III Roads
(a)

width
of
the
existing
carriageway,

(ii)
Outside gates
The surface should not be of a lower specification than that

Class II roads,
it will be desirable to have a black-topped
surface for a distance of at least 30 m beyond each gate.
7. MINIMUM WIDTH OF GATES AT RIGHT ANGLES

9.3. On level crossings across Class IV roads, stakes shall
be fixed between the gate posts to prevent passage of road
vehicles.

Standards should be provided at all gradient changes. The level
distances mentioned above are exclusive of the lengths required
for the provision ofvertical curves.
13. ANGLE OF CROSSING BETWEEN THE CENTRE
LINES OF THE RAILWAY TRACK AND
THE ROAD
The angle of crossing between the centre line of the road and that of
the railway track should ordinarily not be lower than 45 degrees* in the
case of Class I, Class II and Class III roads. For Class IV roads, the angle
ofcrossing should be 90 degrees.
14. MINIMUM RADIUS OF THE CENTRE LINE OF THE
ROAD ON CURVED APPROACHES
14.1.
Minimum radius of the curve shall depend upon the design
speed, coefficient of friction between the tyres and road surface and
maximum allowable value of superelevation. The minimum radii for
different design speeds for good surfaced roads may be provided as

In difficult terrain where
it
is not possible to adopt the
above standard, the radius may be reduced with the concurrence ofthe
RoadAuthority.
14.3.
For
other categories of roads, the best possible radius
having regard to safety ofthe road traffic, should be adopted.
15. SIGHT DISTANCES
15.1. The roads in the vicinity of the level crossings shall be
provided with sight distances depending upon the design speed as per

To further improve visibility, gate lodges should be so
sited that a clear and unobstructed view is obtained by the road traffic
of all approaching trains. While doing so, care should be taken to
make allowance for all possible future extensions, e.g., additions to
the railway track(s) or widening ofthe road.

15.3.
On unmanned level crossings, efforts should be made to
keep the sight triangles demarcated in the four corners on the basis of
speeds oftrains and the road vehicles, clear ofany obstruction to sight.
16. MINIMUM STRAIGHT LENGTH OF ROAD
OUTSIDE THE GATES
This shall normally be 30 m, 22.5 and
1 5 m for level crossings of
Class I, Class II and Class III roads respectively. The straight length
may, however, be reduced depending on sight conditions if difficult to
attain. The reduction should, however, not go below the minimum
straight lengths of 1 5 m,
9 m, and 4.5 m for the three classes of roads
respectively.
17. WARNING TO ROAD TRAFFIC OF THE
PROXIMITY OF LEVEL CROSSING
17.1. Unguarded Railway Crossing
The sign should be used on the approaches of level crossings
where there are no gates or other barriers. A pair of signs shall be used
for the purpose
:
(i) an advance warning sign located at 200 metre
away from the crossing, and (ii) a second sign to be erected near the
crossing. The distance of the second sign from the crossing may be
50-100 metre in plain and rolling terrain and 30-60 metre
in hilly
terrain.
17.2. Guarded Railway Crossing
The sign should be used to warn traffic on the approaches of
guarded railway crossings. A pair of signs shall be used for the
purpose
:
(i) an advance warning sign located at 200 metre away
from the crossing, and
(ii) a second sign to be erected near the
crossing. The distance of the second
sign from the crossing may be
50-100 metre in plain and rolling terrain and 30-60 metre in hilly
terrain.
17.3. Gates should be painted white, with a red disc not less
than 60 cm in diameter in the centre. The gate posts also must be
painted white. Where gates or chains are not provided, posts must

ofthe crossing at the prescribed distance as per IRC
: 67.

limit on speed of approaching traffic shall be installed on either
end ofthe crossing at the prescribed distance.
2 1.3.Rumble strips on both sides of the Railway crossing
shall be provided as per following specifications. A common
application of rumple
strips
is the placement of intermittent,
raised bituminous overlays across the roadway. Raised sections
can be 15-25 mm high, 200-300 mm wide, and spaced about one
metre centre to centre. A series of such strips, roughly 15-20 at
