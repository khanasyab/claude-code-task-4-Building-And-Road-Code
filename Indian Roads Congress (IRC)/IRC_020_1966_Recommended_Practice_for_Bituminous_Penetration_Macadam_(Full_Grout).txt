RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR BITUMINOUS
PENETRATION MACADAM
(FULL GROUT)
1.
INTRODUCTION
The Recommended Practice for Bituminous
Penetration Maca-
dam (Full Grout) prepared by the Bituminous Pavements Committee
of the
Indian
Roads
Congress was approved
by
the
Executive
Committee of the Indian Roads
Congress
at
their meeting held on
the 30th
September 1964 and was later approved
for publication as
Recommended Practice by the Council of the Indian Roads Congress
at their meeting held at Jaipur on the 28tfa November
1964.
Some
comments received
later
on
were
considered
by
the Bituminous
Pavements Committee at their meeting held on
the 29th
April 1966
and some minor changes were made.
This Recommended
Practice
is
intended
to indicate what
is
considered to be a good practice
under
average
conditions.
It
is
realised that in certain
localities,
there
will
be
special conditions
which may necessitate modifications of the
clauses
laid down in this
Recommended Practice.
Provisions made
in
this Recommended
Practice
shall apply
unless modified by special provisions to
take
into
account unusual
conditions.

DESCRIPTION
Bituminous penetration macadam shall consist of the
construc-
tion of one or more courses of compacted crushed aggregates bonded
and keyed by alternate
applications
cf
bituminous
materials
and
filling aggregate (key aggregates) and the
applications
of a seal coat,
when specified.
Thickness of
n individual
course
shall not exceed
75 mm.

4.3.
Preparation of Base
The
underlying course on which bituminous
penetration maca-
dam
is to be laid
shall
be
prepared,
shaped and conditioned to a
uniform grade and section as specified.
Any depressions or
potholes
should be properly made up and thorougly compacted
suH'iciently in
advance.
Any priming,
if needed, may be applied
in acordance with
the I.R.C. Tentative
Specification
for
Priming
of Base Course with
Bituminous
Primers.
4.4.
Spreading and Compacting Coarse Aggregate
4.4.1.
The coarse aggregate shall be spread (with suitable edge
protections) and hand packed to a uniform depth
and
true to align-
ment profile and grade.
A testing template cut to the camber of the
finished pavement shall be used to obtain uniformity of the surface.
The spreading shall be carried
no
further
in
advance of the
rolling and penetrating operations
that
can
be
completed
in one
average
day's work.
Segregated aggregate
or aggregate mixed with
earth or other foreign substances shall be removed and replaced with
graded
aggregate.
4.4.2.
Rolling
The aggregate shall
be
dry
rolled
with
a
ten-ton road roller
until compacted and keyed.
The
rolling
shall
begin
at
the sides,
overlapping the shoulder
at
least
30 cm and
shall proceed
to the
centre.
In the
case
of
superelevated
curves,
lapping
should be
approximately
1/3 of the width of the rear wheel
on each trip.
After
the edges have been rolled, the rolling shall progress
from the inside
to the outside of the curve.
After the initial rolling,
the
surface
shall
be
checked with a
crown template and a 3-metre straight
edge.
The
surface shall not
vary more than 12 mm from
the
template
or
straight
edge.
All
surface irregularities exceeding the above limit
shall
be corrected by
removing or adding aggregates as
required.
Each course shall
be
uniformly
compacted,
the rolling shall
stop before the voids are closed to such an extent
as
to prevent free
and uniform penetration of the bitumen and key aggregate.
4 5.
Application of Bituminous Material
After the coarse aggregate
has
been
rolled
and checked, the
bituminous binder shall be applied
at a
temperature
appropriate to
5

the type and grade of
the
binder.
The
rate
of
application
for
different thicknesses is specified in Tabic 6.

Before applying the binder, the aggregate
shall
be surface dry
for
its entire depth.
The bituminous material shall preferably be
applied by a pres-
sure distributor uniformly
over
the
surface
at the
specified rate.
Over small areas, where the use of a
spray bar
is impracticable, the
material shall be applied by the nozzle attachment.
Only when per-
mitted, pouring pots may be used according to
the
directions of the
Engineer-in-charge.
4.6.
Application of Key Aggregate
Immediately after
the
first
penetration
of
bitumen, the key
aggregate shall be spread uniformly over the surface by means
of an
approved mechanical
spreader
or by
appi :ved
manual
methods,
rolled, dragged with drag-broom to accomplish uniform
distribution
and roiled again. Key aggregate
shall be added where
needed, and
rolling and brooming shall
continue
until
the
key aggregates are
locked in the surface.
The surface shall be maintained true to grade
and cross-section.
4.7.
Seal Coat
Seal coat shall be applied
before
opening
the road to traffic.
The binder, heated to the requisite
temperature,
should
be applied
to the cle^n surface.
The chippings shall then be spread and rolled.

4.8.
Finishing
The finished surface shall
be
uniform
and
conform
to the
lines, grades and typical cross-sections
shown
in
the specifications.
The same should be
checked
as
per
methods
laid
down
in the
^'Handbook of
Quality
Control
for Construction
of
Roads
and
Runways" — IRC
Special
Publication:
11-1977.
The
maximum
permissible undulation on
the
longitudinal
profile
is
12 mm and
also the number of
undulations
of
10 mm
or
more
should not
exceed 30 in a
length of 300
metre.
The
maximum
permissible
variation in the cross-profile
is 8 mm.
5.
OPENING TO TRAFFIC
The finished surface
shall
be
opened
to
traffic
preferably
24 hours after rolling
the
bituminous
macadam
but
if, in special
circumstances, the road
is required
to
be
opened to traffic
earlier,
it may be done provided the speed of
vehicles
is restricted to 15 km
per hour.
