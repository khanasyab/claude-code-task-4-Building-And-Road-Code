INTRODUCTION
The
Standard
Specifications and Code
of Practice
for Road
Bridges
Section:
IX-Bearings-Part
I:
Metallic Bearings was
initially
prepared by the Sub-Committee for Bridge Bearings and Expansion Joints
and approved by
the Bridge
Specifications &
Standards Committee,
Executive Committee and the Council.
This was subsequently published
as IRC83-1982
- Part
I in December, 1982. The requirement of revising
the IRC83-1982
- Part I to cope up with the technological developments
which have taken place in this field of engineering has been felt for quite
some
time.
The
first
draft
revision was prepared by
the Technical
Committee on Bearings, Joints & Appurtenance during 1991-93 with Shri
B.J. Dave as the Convenor. This Committee was reconstituted in January,
1994 consisting of the following personnel

IRC:83 (Part I)- 1999
The reconstituted Committee discussed the draft during number
of meetings held between January, 1994 and January, 1997. The draft was
finalised by this Committee after making necessary modifications.
The
draft was considered and approved by
the Bridge
Specifications & Standards Committee at their meeting held at New Delhi
on 27.9.97 and approved by the Executive Committee on 29. 1 1 .97 and then
by the Council in their meeting held on 5.1.98
at Bhopal.
The provisions of this Code shall supersede the following clauses
of IRC:24-1967.
"Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Road
Bridges, Section V: Steel Road Bridges".
Clause Nos. 502.10, 504.7, 504.8, 504.9, 504.10, 504.11, 505.11.2 to

1, S.No. 8th and 9th of Table 2 giving
reference to clause No. 504.7 and 504. 1

.
900. SCOPE
This Code deals with the design, manufacture, testing positioning
and maintenance of Metallic Bearings, on road bridges. The provisions of
this Code are meant to serve as a guide to both the design and construction
engineers, but mere compliance with the provisions
stipulated herein will
not relieve them in any way of their responsibility for the stability and
soundness
of the
structure designed and
erected.
This code covers
longitudinal movement (mainly for monoaxial movement) only, special
bearings like spherical bearings are excluded.
901. DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this Code, the following definitions shall apply:
901.1.
Bearings

from the structure above and transmits the same to the supporting structure.
901.2.

and simultaneously allows rotational movement, Fig. 3.

structure and transmits
forces from the bearing to the supporting structure.
901 .10.

parts of a bearing for arresting relative sliding movement of the top and
bottom parts without restricting rotational movement.

Testing
909.2. 1
.
The manufacturer has to produce test certificate from
original producers of raw materials used in the manufacture of the bearings.
Irrespective of the producers test certificates, the manufacturer will carry
out the detailed tests on raw materials (both physical and chemical) for
different types of raw materials used in the manufacture of the bearings as
per relevant
codes for such raw materials.
For this purpose they
will
identify stock materials with certain batch number and draw samples from
such stock materials and mark the same with same batch numbers. For each
batch, 3 sets of samples will be drawn separately for tests of physical and
chemical properties on samples. The manufacturer will carry out tests on
chemical and physical
properties on one
set of samples and keep
the
remaining 2
sets of samples duly identified with the batch number for
verification
by
the Engineer and/or
his
authorised
representatives
for
conformatory tests with respect to the results obtained by the manufacturer.
Such tests can be carried out on a few samples selected at random by the
discretion of the Engineer and/or his representatives. The following IS
Codes may be
referred
for carrying out such
tests
(both physical and
chemical)

conducted on the integral test piece (per heat) attached to anyone of the
forging.
909.2.4.
All bearings shall be tested to

9 10.2.
Positioning of Bearings
910.2.1.
During installation the bearings shall be pre-set with
respect
to
the bearing
axis
to account
for the movements due
to
the
following
:

the
average
temperature
prevailing
at
the
time of
installation and
the mean

For bridges
in gradient the bearing plates
shall be
placed in a horizontal plane.
9 10.3.
Precautions during Construction
910.3.1.
In
prestressed construction where launching
of
girders is employed, in order to avoid slipping or jumping of rollers due to
vibrations or jolts,
it is suggested that the roller bearings be provided after
launching operations or otherwise adequate measures taken to ensure that
the roller assembly is not disturbed.
It is normal practice to provide rocker
bearings on the launching end and place the beam on the rocker end slightly
in advance of placing on the roller.
910.3.2.
During concreting of girders, the bearings shall be
held in position securely by providing temporary connection between the
top and bottom plates in case of fixed bearings, and between top plate,
saddle plate and base plate in case of a roller-cum-rocker bearing or by any
other suitable arrangement which prevents the relative displacement of the
components. The bearing plate shall be kept level during concreting.
910.3.3.
In pre-stressed pre-cast girders where recesses are left
on the underside of girders to receive the anchor bolts, grout holes extending
to the beam sides or to the deck level shall be provided.
The grout shall
have a mix of 1:1.
911. INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF BEARINGS
911.1.
Suitable easy access to the bearing shall be provided
for inspection and maintenance.
911.2.
Provision
shall
be made
for jacking up of the
superstructure so as to allow for adjustment repair/replacement of rollers of
the bearings.
911.3.
Each
bridge
bearing assembly and
the
adjacent
members in contact shall be inspected at least once a year to ascertain their
actual
condition and
suitable remedial measures taken immediately
if
defects
are
noticed
including replacement
in
the event of irrepairable
damage.
However,
the bearings
shall also be examined carefully
after
unusual occurrences like heavy traffic damage, earthquakes, and batterings
from
debris
in high
floods.
Necessary records of inspection
shall
be
maintained.

Permissible stresses in a bolt of
any other property class will be as
per CI. 8.9.4.3 of IS:800- 1984
which is reproduced below for
convenience:
"The permissible stress in a bolt
(other than a high strength friction
grip bolt) of property class
higher
than 4.6 shall be those given
in
Table 8.
1 multiplied by the ratio of
its yield stress or 0.2 per cent proof
stress or 0.7 times its tensile
strength,
whichever
is the lesser to 235
MPa."
Note
:
Components of bearings should be designed for the worst combination of
loads with no increase in permisible stresses.

Throughout
the
length of the body
of forged
proof-machine rollers in all possible direction at least
covering the surface area upto

Calibration of the machine (UFD) is to be done using
IIW block/standard calibration block for a range of
2.00 mm.
The sensitivity shall be set on a 3.0 mm dia.
Flat
bottom (FB) hole drilled upto a depth of 25 mm on a

dia.
Class
3 forged bar
having reflection of screen height of 75% from the
FB hole.
i)
Forged rollers shall not contain harmful defect
like
shrinkage,
cavities,
porosities,
piping
cracks
etc.
Any type of surface crack
is not
acceptable.
ii)
Flaw
signal more
than 70%
height
at one
location shall be a cause for rejection in case the
flaw is along the central axis zone of the roller
(i.e. 12.0 mm either side of the axis line).

Flaw signals equal or more than 50% height
shall
be
a cause
of rejection
in
case two
consecutive flaw echos
are
within 200 mm
distance at the central axis zone.
iv)
At no point the length of the central axis zone
defect shall exceed 2 probe position.
' v)
The defects so detected, shall not be spaced less
than 200 mm at the roller ends (within
1 00 mm).
vi)
Total number of defects shall not exceed 3 in
one roller.
vii)
Connected
discontinuities
shall
not
be
permitted.
