CODE OF PRACTICE FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OF JOINTED PLAIN CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
1. INTRODUCTION
The Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Construction of Concrete Road was 
first published in July 1965. It was revised in 1970 and the second edition was brought out 
in December, 1981. The third edition was brought out in the year of 2002. The fourth edition 
of the document was published in 2011. Since then the technology for road construction has 
undergone considerable changes and MORT&H Specifications for Road and Bridge Works 
has been revised. Some special requirements like widening of existing four lane concrete 
road to six lane and construction of four lane concrete pavement in place of existing two 
lane bituminous road have arisen. Some problems relating to the construction of transition 
slab between rigid and flexible pavement, corrosion of dowel bars and damage done to the 
slabs by vibratory trails have been observed in concrete pavements constructed in the last 
few years. The use of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) and Metakaolin as 
mineral admixture, Poly-Carboxylate Ether based High Range Water Reducing Admixtures, 
string-less paving system for paving concrete, Magnetic Pulse Induction technique for 
checking alignment of dowel bars have emerged and being practiced for better construction 
of concrete roads.
Therefore a need was felt to update the standard to include the latest development in the area 
of construction of concrete roads. The revised draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising 
of Shri Binod Kumar, Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Raman Kumar, and Shri Rajesh Madaan, members 
of the Rigid Pavement Committee. The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) deliberated on 
the document in a series of meetings and finalised it in its meeting held on 27th May, 2017. 
The revised draft was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee 
(HSS) in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The HSS committee approved the draft with 
some suggestions including the change in the title of the code. The draft revised as per the 
suggestions of HSS and with changed title of “Code of Practice for Construction of Jointed 
Plain Concrete Pavements” was approved by the Council of IRC after taking on board the 
comments of the members in its 212th Mid-Term Council meeting held on 14th & 15th July, 
2017 at Udaipur. 
The Composition of H-3 Committee is as given below:

3. MATERIALS
3.1	
Cement
Any of the following types of cement capable of achieving the design strength may be used. 
The minimum 28 days compressive strength of the cement should not be less than 43 MPa.
	
i)	
Ordinary Portland Cement IS:269 (43 Grade and 53 Grade) including 5% 
performance Improver (Mineral admixture etc. as per IS:269)
	
ii)	
Portland-Pozzolana Cement IS:1489 (Part 1) 
	
iii)	
Portland Slag Cement, IS:455 
	
iv)	
Composite Cement (blended with granulated slag & fly ash), IS:16415
If the soil around concrete pavement has soluble salts, like sulphates in excess of 0.5 per 
cent, the cement used shall be Sulphate Resisting Portland Cement, IS:12330. The limits 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 96
======================================================================
4
IRC:15-2017
of sulphate concentration (as sulphur trioxide) is that limit where either it is more than 
0.2% in subgrade soil or more than 0.3% in ground water. Cement used in both DLC and 
pavement quality concrete in such situations should be sulphate-resistant. If chlorides 
are present, Sulphate Resisting Cement shall not be used, and in such case Portland 
Slag Cement should be used.
Cement to be used may preferably be obtained in bulk. If cement in paper bags is proposed 
to be used, there shall be bag-splitters with the facility to separate pieces of paper bags and 
dispose them off suitably. No paper pieces shall enter the concrete mix. Bulk cement shall 
be stored either in vertical or horizontal silos. The cement shall be subjected to acceptance 
tests prior to its use. 
3.2 	
Admixtures
3.2.1 	
Chemical Admixtures
Admixtures conforming to IS:9103 may be used to improve workability of the concrete 
or extension of setting time, on satisfactory evidence that they will not have any adverse 
effect on the properties of concrete with respect to strength, volume change, durability 
and have no deleterious effect on embedded steel. Satisfactory performance of the 
admixtures should be proved both on the laboratory concrete trial mixes and in trial 
paving works. If air entraining admixture is used for improving the workability of the mix 
and to reduce bleeding, the total quantity of air in air-entrained concrete as a percentage 
of the volume of the concrete shall have 4.5±1.5 per cent entrained air for 31.5 mm 
maximum size of aggregate and 5.0±1.5 per cent for 19 mm maximum size of aggregate. 
In freezing weather, use of air entraining agent is recommended to counter the freezing 
and thawing effect with 5.5±1.5 per cent entrained air for 31.5 mm maximum size of 
aggregate and 6.0±1.5 per cent for 19 mm maximum size of aggregate. The maximum 
quantity of chemical admixture shall be 2 per cent by weight of cementitious materials 
(cement + fly ash/ground granulated blast furnace slag/silica fume).
3.2.2	
Compatibility and optimum dose of the particular admixture (from a specific 
manufacturer) with the specific cement type (from a particular manufacturing plant) to be 
used, shall be established by Marsh Cone Test as per ASTM C939. Concrete mix should be 
designed for a combination of a particular cement and admixture, and admixture supplyer 
and type cannot be substituted without test confirming the required results.
3.2.3	
Mineral Admixtures
Mineral admixtures can improve the workability, long term strength and durability of 
concrete. The following materials may be added as mineral admixtures subject to their 
availability and corresponding policy guidelines regarding their usage by the Central/
State Governments.

IRC:15-2017
3.2.3.1	
Fly ash (as per IS:3812 (Part 1)
Fly ash upto 25 per cent by weight of Cementitious Material (CM) may be mixed at site 
with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) 53/43 Grade. The fly ash shall conform to IS:3812 
(Part I). Fly ash of no other Grade shall be used.
Site mixing of fly ash shall be permitted only after ensuring availability of the equipments 
at site for uniform blending through a specific mechanized facility with automated process 
control like batch mix plants conforming to IS:4925 and IS:4926. Site mixing will not be 
allowed otherwise.
3.2.3.2	
Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag
Factory manufactured ground granulated blast furnace slag (as per IS:10875) upto 
50 per cent by weight of cementitious material may be mixed at site with Ordinary Portland 
Cement of 43/53 Grade. Regular tests shall be conducted on GGBFS at a testing frequency 
of 1 test per 100 MT of slag to ensure the quality. 
3.2.3.3	
Silica fume
Silica fume up to 10 per cent by weight of OPC (as per IS:15388, IRC:SP:114 and IRC:44, if 
specified in design may be used.
3.2.3.4	
Metakaolin
Metakaolin is obtained by calcinations of pure and refined kaolinitic clay at a temperature 
between 650 and 850 °C followed by grinding to a fineness of 700 to 900 m2/kg. Metakaolin 
conforming to IS:16354 may be used upto 20 per cent of the cementitious material.
3.3	
Aggregates
3.3.1	
Aggregates for pavement concrete shall be complying with IS:383. The limits of 
deleterious materials shall not exceed the requirements set out in IS:383.
3.3.2	
The aggregates shall be free from chert, flint, chalcedony or silica in a form that 
can react with the alkalies in the cement. In addition, the total chlorides content expressed as 
chloride ion content shall not exceed 0.06 per cent by weight and the total sulphate content 
expressed as sulphuric anhydride (SO3) shall not exceed 0.25 per cent by weight. In case the 
aggregates are not free from dirt, the same may be washed and drained for at least 72 hours 
before batching.
No aggregate which has water absorption more than 2 per cent shall be used in concrete 
mix. All aggregates shall be tested for soundness in accordance with IS:2386 (Part V). After 
5 cycles of testing, the loss shall not be more than 12 per cent if sodium sulphate solution 
is used or 18 per cent if magnesium sulphate solution is used, irrespective of their water 
absorption.

IRC:15-2017
3.3.3	
Coarse aggregate
Coarse aggregate shall consist of clean, hard, strong, dense, non-porous and durable pieces 
of crushed stone or crushed gravel and shall be devoid of pieces of disintegrated stone, soft, 
flaky, elongated, very angular or splintery pieces. The combined flakiness and elongation 
index shall not be more than 35 per cent. Aggregate Impact Value (AIV) shall not be more 
than 30 per cent. Limestone aggregate may be used conforming to IS:383. The maximum 
size of coarse aggregate shall not exceed 31.5 mm in PQC and 26.5 mm in case of DLC.
Continuously graded aggregates may be used, depending on the combined grading of the 
coarse and fine aggregate. 
Iron slag aggregate, steel slag aggregate up to 30 per cent, Recycled Concrete Aggregate 
(RCA) up to 30 per cent of total coarse aggregate can be used in Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) 
only.
3.3.4	
Fine aggregate
The fine aggregate shall consist of clean natural sand or crushed stone sand or a combination 
of the two and shall conform to IS:383. Fine aggregate shall be free from soft particles, 
clay, shale, loam, cemented particles, mica and organic and other foreign matter. The fine 
aggregate shall not contain substances more than the following: 
	
Clay lumps 	
: 1.0%
	
Coal and lignite	: 1.0%
	
Material passing IS sieve No. 75 micron 	
: 
	
i)	
Natural sand	
	
:	
3% by weight of natural sand
	
ii)	
Crushed Stone sand	
:	
12% by weight of crushed stone 
	
iii)	
Blend of natural sand and crushed stone sand: shall not exceed 8% by total 
weight of fine aggregates (IS:383)
Although IS:383 permits in the case of stone crushed sand, the fines passing 75 microns up 
to 15 per cent, this provision should be used with caution when crushed stone sand is used 
as fine aggregate and when the mix produced in the Laboratory and the field is satisfactory 
in all respects and complies with the requirement of Specification. The grading zone of fine 
aggregates as per IS:383 shall be within the limits as given in Table 1.

The fine aggregates conforming to any one of the above three grading zones may be used. 
From grading Zones I to III, the fine aggregate grading becomes progressively finer and 
therefore the ratio of fine aggregate to coarse aggregate should be progressively reduced. In 
all cases concrete mix should be properly designed as per IRC:44 recommendations. 
In case of grading in all Grading Zones falls outside the limits of any particular grading 
Zone of sieves other than 600 micron IS: Sieve by an amount not exceeding 5 per cent for 
a particular sieve size, (subject to cumulative amount of 10 per cent), it shall be regarded 
as falling within that grading zone. This tolerance shall not be applied to percentage 
passing the 600 micron IS: Sieve or to percentage passing any other sieve size on the 
coarse limit of grading Zone I. 
For crushed stone sands, the permissible limit on 150 micron IS Sieve may be increased to 
20 per cent in Table 1 above. The use of crushed stone sand is permitted in PQC, however, 
percentage of fines passing 75 micron IS Sieve in case of PQC shall not exceed 12 per cent.
3.3.5

Materials for Joint Sealing
3.7.1	
Joint Sealing
The joint sealing compound shall be of hot poured, elastomeric type or cold polysulphide/
polyurethane/silicon type having flexibility, durability and resistance to age hardening. 
Manufacturer’s certificate shall be produced by the contractor for establishing that the 
sealant is not more than six months old and stating that the sealant complies with the relevant 
standard mentioned below. 
The material for cold poured joint sealant shall conform to any one of the following:
Polysulphide		
IS:11433 (Part I), BS:5212 (Part II)
Polyurethene		
BS:5212
Silicon	
	
	
ASTM D5893-04
If the sealant is of hot poured type, it shall conform to IS:1834 or ASTM: D 3406, as applicable. 
Hot poured joint sealing compound should not be heated above 180ºC and also over long 
duration; both are not permitted as it will lose its properties due to overheating. Material once 
heated cannot be reheated again for use. Hence, the quantity of material to be heated should 
be such that it is used fully. The overheated or reheated material will be rejected. Therefore, 
quantity of sealing compound required for one operation of joint sealing work shall only be 
heated.
3.7.2	
Pre-moulded joint filler
Synthetic joint filler board for expansion joints which are proposed for use only at some 
abutting structures, like, bridges and culverts shall be of 20-25 mm thickness within a tolerance 
of ± 1.5 mm and of a firm compressible material and having compressibility of more than 
25 per cent as per IS:1838. It shall be 25 mm less in depth than the thickness of the slab 
within a tolerance of ± 3 mm and provided to the full width between the side forms. It shall be 
in suitable length which shall not be less than one lane width. If two pieces are joined to make 
up full width, the joint shall be taped such that no slurry escapes through the joint. Holes to 
accommodate dowel bars shall be accurately bored or punched out to give a sliding fit on the 
dowel bars. IS:1838 (Part 1) and IS:10566 may be referred for more details.
3.7.3	
Preformed Seals
The pre-formed joint sealing material shall be a vulcanized elastomeric compound using 
polychloroprene (Neoprene) as the base polymer. The joint seal shall conform to requirements 
of ASTM D 2628.

4. PROPORTIONING OF CONCRETE
4.1	
Proportioning of Materials
For the design of PQC IRC:44 shall be referred.
4.1.1	
In case of dry lean concrete, mix design shall be done as per IRC:SP:49 and in 
case of PQC, guidance for mix design, may be taken from IRC:44 for ascertaining the flexural/
compressive strength of cement concrete required to match with the prescribed design 
strength of concrete. As the stresses induced in concrete pavements are mainly flexural, it is 
required that their design is based on the flexural strength of concrete in all major projects. 
The mix shall be so designed in the laboratory as to ensure the minimum flexural strength 
in the field with the desired tolerance level as per IRC:44. To achieve the desired minimum 
strength in the field, the mix in the laboratory shall be designed for somewhat higher strength, 
making due allowance for the type and extent of quality control likely to obtained in the field 
as to ensure the minimum strength is achieved in the field for this purpose. 
4.1.2	
For concrete roads, flexural strength of concrete is the design criteria. For all major 
projects, flexural strength of the mix shall be determined by third point loading of flexural 
beams (150 mm x 150 mm x 700 mm) as per IS:516. Determination of flexural strength by 
correlating with cube strength (compressive strength) shall not be allowed for major projects, 
as the correlation is not well established.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 96
======================================================================
11

IRC:15-2017
Where it is proposed to estimate the flexural strength by correlating with cube compressive 
strength, the correlation should first be established with laboratory tests by testing minimum 
30 specimens of cubes as well as beams prepared from the same mix which is to be used 
in the field.
4.1.3	
Where facilities for testing beams with three point loading are not available, in 
such cases, the mix design may be carried out by using compressive strength values and 
there after flexural strength will be determined as per correlation between flexural strength 
with compressive strength given below. 
	
fcr = 0.7 √(fck)
………………… (1)
Where fcr is the Flexural strength in MPa or N/mm2 and fck is the characteristic compressive 
strength in MPa or N/mm2 as per IS:456. For design of cement concrete mixes, guidance 
may be taken from IRC:44.
4.2	
Cement Content
The minimum cement content for the mix corresponding to achieve flexural strength of 
4.5 MPa in the field at 28 days is given in para 4.2.1.
4.2.1	
Minimum cement content shall be 360 kg/m3 for all type of cements i.e. OPC, 
PPC, PSC and composite cement. In case fly ash (as per IS:3812- Part 1) is blended at site, 
the quantity of fly ash shall be restricted to 25 per cent by weight of CM and the quantity of 
OPC in such a blend shall not be less than 310 kg/m3. In case of GGBFS, minimum cement 
content shall be 250 kg. If this minimum OPC content is not sufficient to produce concrete of 
the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary. The OPC content, however, shall 
not exceed 450 kg/m3 of concrete. 
4.3 	
Approximate Proportions
The approximate proportions by weight necessary to produce concrete satisfying the above 
conditions using aggregates from the sources designated may be furnished in the tender 
documents, for guidance only. It should be expressly understood that this information is only 
for the convenience of the bidder and does not relieve the bidder from the requirement of 
proper mix design for the specified characteristic strength. 
4.4 	
Job Mix
The job mix determined by the laboratory for the particular aggregates approved by the 
Engineer shall govern. These proportions will be corrected and adjusted by the Engineer 
to compensate for moisture content in the aggregates or fluctuations in the grading of 
coarse and fine aggregates at the time of use. Any change in the source of materials or mix 
proportions found necessary during the work shall be assessed by making laboratory trial 
mixes. Contractor must make efforts to get the mix proportion approved at least one and a 
half month in advance of commencing paving operation in trial length.

IRC:15-2017
4.5	
Water Content and Workability 
4.5.1	
The maximum free water-cement or water-cementitious material ratio of the 
concrete mix shall be 0.40. At such a low water cement ratio and on account of long distances 
over which concrete needs to be transported in road projects, use of superplasticizers is 
inevitable for achieving the desired workability. The superplasticizers conforming to IS:9103-
1999 are generally desirable for road works. The quantity of admixtures shall be determined 
by trials.
The requirement of workability depends upon the equipment used for the compaction and 
the method of placement of concrete. The control of workability in the field shall be exercised 
by the slump test as per IS:1199. The slump in the range of 20 to 30 mm for concrete laid 
with slip form paver and 40 to 60 mm for concrete laid with fixed-form paver is reasonable. 
However, it may be modified depending upon the site requirement and got approved by the 
engineer.
The probable time for transporting concrete from mixing plant to paving site should be 
specified. During this time delay slump loss takes place, and concrete mix design should 
account for the slump loss.
4.5.2	
Workability tests shall be carried out on every tipper or dumper at batching and 
mixing plant site and paving site initially when the work commences but subsequently the 
frequency can be reduced to alternate tipper or as per the instructions of the engineer.
5. TOOLS, PLANTS & EQUIPMENT
5.1	
General
All tools, plants & equipments necessary for proper preparation of subgrade, laying of sub-
base and batching, mixing, placing, finishing and curing of concrete shall be at the project 
site in good working condition. These shall have to be inspected by the Engineer before 
the paving operations are permitted to start. Throughout the construction of the project, the 
construction agency shall maintain all necessary tools, equipment and appliances in good 
working condition to ensure proper execution of the work. Arrangements shall also be made 
for requisite number of stand-by units in the event of break-downs during construction. 
5.2

LAYING OF SEPARATION MEMBRANE
6.1	
General
The embankment/subgrade shall be prepared as under: The existing surface shall be cleared 
and grubbed. The two passes of roller shall be given after light spray of water. The initial 
levels will be recorded. The embankment shall be laid as per specifications. 
The Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) shall be laid on two layers of sub-base. Granular sub-
base (GSB) acting as a lower sub-base and Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) acting as upper sub-
base. GSB, the lower sub-base shall be laid over a subgrade of minimum 500 mm compacted 
thicknesses. Subgrade shall be of selected earth complying the following requirements:
	
(i)	
No soft spots are present in the subgrade.
	
(ii)	
The subgrade shall have a minimum CBR of 8 per cent.
	
(iii)	 The camber and super-elevation of subgrade shall be same as that of the 
DLC & PQC.
6.2	
Capillary Cut-off
6.2.1	
As a result of migration of water by capillarity from the high water table, the soil 
immediately below the pavement gets more and more wet and this leads to gradual loss in its 
bearing capacity besides non-uniform support. Several measures, such as, lowering the sub-
soil water table by drainage measures, raising of the embankment or provision of a capillary 
cut-off may be provided for mitigating this deficiency. It should be investigated for arriving at 
the optimum solution. 
6.2.2	
The capillary cut-off may be a layer of coarse or fine sand, graded gravel, 
bituminised material, geo-composite, or an impermeable membrane. 
6.2.3	
Capillary cut-off/blanket layer, of required thickness may be placed over compacted 
subgrade layer. Cut-off with bituminised or other materials may be provided in any of the 
following ways:
 
(i) 
Coarse or fine sand or graded gravel
	
	
The minimum thickness of these materials shall be 150 mm. Whenever, 
sand/gravel is used as cut-off layer, the layer shall not be provided at the 
edges but should be replaced with suitable filter of graded granular material 
with or without non-woven geo-textile material.

Geo-composite/Geo-filter layer
	
	
Geo-composite fabrics may also be used to function as capillary cut-off.
6.2.4	
For more details about mitigating the adverse effects of high water table, reference 
may be made to IRC:34 “Recommendations for Road Construction in Areas affected by 
Water Logging, Flooding and/or Salts Infestation”.
6.3	
The Sub-base
6.3.1	
The Sub-base provided under the concrete slabs comprises Granular Sub base 
(GSB) as lower sub-base and Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) which is provided over GSB as 
upper sub-base. Permeability coefficient of GSB shall be at least 300 m/day. 
6.3.2	
The material to be used for the GSB shall be natural sand, crushed gravel, crushed 
stone, or combination thereof depending upon the grading required. The material shall be 
free from organic or other deleterious constituents and shall conform to the IS:383. 
6.3.3	
Table 4 prescribes six grading for Granular Sub-Base (GSB). GSB layer shall 
comprise of two layers. For lower layer called as filter/separation layer Grading I, II, V or 
VI shall be used. For upper layer called as drainage layer, Grading III or Grading IV shall 
be used. Minimum compacted thickness shall be 100 mm for each layer. Alternatively, geo-
composite layer may also be used. If geo-composite layer is used as separation layer then 
minimum 150 mm thick GSB, Grading III or Grading IV shall be provided as drainage layer 
on top of geo-composite layer. However, the use of geo-composite layer should be resorted 
to only if it is economically viable. 
6.3.4	
Physical Requirements of Aggregates used in GSB
The material shall have a 10 per cent fines value of 50 kN or more (for sample in soaked 
condition) when tested in compliance with IS:2386 (Part IV) 1963. The water absorption 
value of the coarse aggregate shall be determined as per IS:2386 (Part III). If this value is 
greater than 2 per cent, the soundness test shall be carried out on the material delivered to 
site as per IS:383. 
6.3.5	
Strength of Sub-Base
In addition to the requirements of minimum CBR of 8 per cent along with other physical 
requirements like density (98 per cent of the modified Proctor lab MDD) when compacted 
and finished.
6.3.6	
This shall be verified by performing CBR tests in the laboratory as required on 
specimens remoulded at field dry density and moisture content.

Modulus of Subgrade Reaction “k”
Rigid pavement is designed by using the corresponding modulus of subgrade reaction “k” 
value of subgrade/sub-base, as the case may be. “k” value is normally determined from plate

DLC Sub-base, Modified “k” Value 
6.5.1	
Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) conforming to IRC:SP:49 shall be used as upper sub-
base for concrete pavements. The use of granular sub-base or sub-base constructed out of 
semi rigid material may also be used. The equivalent “k” value for different type of upper sub-
bases (like DLC/semi rigid materials/cement treated or stabilized sub-base/granular sub-
base) corresponding to “k” value of the subgrade is required to be known for design of rigid 
pavement.
6.5.2	
Table 6 gives the ‘k’ values of granular and cement treated sub-bases for three 
types of subgrade soils.

*   Maximum k value shall be 300 MPa/m. In calculating other values as per proportion, the value of 
300 MPa/m shall be taken instead of 417 MPa/m. 
6.5.4	
Thickness of DLC sub-base should be minimum 150 mm. The surface finish of the 
sub-base shall be smooth. The average compressive strength of each consecutive group of 
5 cubes shall not be less than 7 MPa at 7 days. For PQC bonded to DLC, the 7-day strength 
of DLC should not be less than 10 MPa. If it is desired to have PQC bonded to DLC, the 
surface of DLC is to be roughened with wire brush within 3-6 hours of laying. 
6.5.5	
Where the embankment consists of clay having liquid limit more than 50 per cent, 
such as, black cotton soil, the subgrade soil should be stabilised with lime and cement or any 
other approved stabilizer (achieving minimum CBR 15 per cent) with a minimum thickness 
of 500 mm. Alternatively, black cotton soil should be replaced with suitable soil of minimum 
CBR of 8 per cent.
6.5.6	
In water-logged areas and where the sub-grade soil is impregnated with deleterious 
salts, such as, sodium sulphate etc. in excess of permissible limits, a capillary cut-off should 
be provided before constructing the sub-base.
6.5.7	
The granular sub-base shall be in a moist condition at the time the DLC is placed 
as per IRC:SP:49. There shall, however, be no pools of water or soft patches formed on the 
sub-base surface.

6.6	
Separation Membrane
A separation membrane shall be used between the PQC and the DLC sub-base unless 
PQC is designed as bonded to DLC sub-base. Separation membrane shall be impermeable 
Polyethylene sheet 150 micron thick as per IS:2508, transparent or white in colour laid flat with 
minimum creases. The minimum width of the separation membrane shall be 3.5 m. Before 
placing the separation membrane, the sub-base shall be swept clean of all the extraneous 
materials using air compressor. Wherever overlap of plastic sheets is necessary, the same 
shall be at least 300 mm. The separation membrane may be nailed to the lower layer with 
concrete nails. 
In summer (when ambient temperature is more than 25oC), before placing separation 
membrane, the existing DLC surface shall be moist with water.
Alternatively, non-woven geo-textile, 4 mm thick, may also be used as separation layer 
between PQC and DLC. 
7. WEATHER LIMITATIONS
7.1	
Concreting in Hot Weather
Placing of concrete in ambient temperatures above 35oC, is associated with defects, like, 
loss of workability through accelerated setting, formation of plastic shrinkage cracks etc., it 
is recommended that unless adequate precautions are taken, no concreting shall be done 
when the ambient temperature is more than 35oC.
7.1.1	
The ambient temperature above 35oC, relative humidity below 25 per cent and/
or wind velocity of more than 15 km/h constitute conditions necessitating precautions to be 
taken for concreting to avoid plastic shrinkage cracking. The associated problem involved in 
concreting in hot weather affect the production, placement and curing of concrete.
7.1.2	
A higher temperature of the fresh concrete results in rapid hydration and leads 
to accelerated setting of concrete. The slump of concrete decreases and hence the water 
demand increases in hot weather. Plastic shrinkage cracks may develop in concrete due to 
evaporation of water from the surface of the concrete. No concreting should be done when 
the concrete temperature is above 30oC. To bring down the temperature of concrete, chilled 
water or ice flakes should be used. In addition to chilled mixing water, cooling of aggregates 
is also desirable. It is advisable to install a chilling plant, so that the temperature of the 
concrete mix can be controlled in hot weather. A ready to use chart to calculate the rate of 
evaporation of water from the concrete for the construction of cement concrete pavement is 
given in Fig. 1. If the rate of evaporation is expected to be above 1 kg/m² per hour near the 
top of the surface, precautions against plastic shrinkage cracking are necessary. The surface 
shall be continuously kept wet by slight fogging/misting and by the use of tents/covers to 
minimize wind speed or providing wet hessian cloth before continuous curing i.e. after 24 
hours of laying.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 96
======================================================================
21

IRC:15-2017
7.1.3	
Plastic shrinkage crack of width 0.2 mm in case of normal weather condition and 
0.3 mm in case of moderate/severe weather condition may be the nucleus for other types 
of damage due to water penetrating through them. Due to increased tensile stresses, these 
cracks may develop into structural cracks with passage of time. Plastic shrinkage cracks 
reduce abrasion resistance of surface and wearing of surface due to traffic will be faster.
7.1.4	
A  good quality concrete, which is strong, impermeable and durable against 
abrasion, chemical attack and adverse effects of weather can only be achieved with suitable 
choice of materials, proper mix proportioning and satisfactory controls at all stages of 
producing, placing and curing of concrete.
7.1.5	
Mixing water has the greatest effect on lowering the temperature of concrete. 
The temperature of water is easier to control than that of another ingredient. The use of cold 
mixing water will reduce the temperature of placing of concrete to some extent. The reduction 
of water temperature can be most economically accomplished by adding ice flakes to it. The 
ice should be manufactured from non-chlorinated water.
7.1.6	
Due to high temperature, the hydration of concrete is faster and rapid stiffening 
of concrete results in increased water demand. Use of rapid hardening cement or 53 grades 
OPC shall be avoided in case of hot weather concreting. The aggregates may be kept shaded 
to protect from direct sun rays. They may also be sprinkled with cold water. 
7.1.7	
To off-set the accelerating setting of concrete in hot weather and to reduce 
increased demand, set retarding and water-reducing admixture should be used. However, 
as some of the admixture can cause undesirable secondary effects such as reduction in 
ultimate strength of concrete or increase of bleeding of concrete, it is recommended that prior 
experience or test data should be available, before their use. The temperature of aggregates, 
water and cement should be maintained at the lowest practical levels, so that the temperature 
of concrete is below 30oC, at the time of placement. 
7.1.8	
The concrete mixer or transit mixer could be painted white on the outer side and 
cover with wet hessian cloth to inhibit absorption of heat from sun and air. The location of 
batching and mixing units should be as close as possible to the site of placement. The sub-
base shall be sprinkled with cold water, just prior to placement of concrete to keep the sub-
base cool but it should be surface dry at the time of placement.
7.1.9	
Weather has profound impact on curing. The process of hydration of cement is 
faster in summer then in winter. Immediately after consolidation and surface finish, concrete 
shall be protected from evaporation of moisture. Fogging or misting of the concrete surface 
before and after final finishing and texturing is very effective way to minimize evaporation 
and reduce plastic shrinkage cracking. It cools and raises the relative humidity of the air just 
above the concrete surface to lessen rapid evaporation. Initial curing shall be done using 
curing compound which will be sprayed on the cement concrete surface when no free water 



======================================================================

is visible on the surface and texturing has been completed. Wet hessian cloth should be 
gently placed after the curing compound has lost its sheen. In place of wet hessian cloth, 
concrete surface may also be covered with plastic sheet from all sides. Wet curing shall 
continue thereafter at least for 14 days in case of OPC and 16 days where blended cement 
or fly ash admixed PQC has been used. There shall be sufficient supply of wet hessian cloth 
for initial curing.

temperature and relative humidity, concrete temperature and wind velocity. (enter the chart on 
the temperature scale and proceed as shown by dotted line, till the rate of evaporation is reached)

7.2	
Concreting in Cold Weather
7.2.1	
When concrete is being placed in cold weather and the air temperature is expected 
to fall below 20oC, the air surrounding the concrete shall be maintained at a temperature of 
15oC for at least 3 days and not less than 4oC for a period of not less than 7 days. Except by 
specific written authorization from the Engineer-in-Charge, concreting shall not be continued 
when a falling air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat drops below 5oC, nor 
shall concreting be resumed until an increasing air temperature in the shade and away from 
artificial heat reaches 5oC. 
7.2.2	
When concrete is likely to be subjected to freezing and thawing the use of air 
entraining agent is mandatory. The air content in the concrete shall be 5.5±1.5 per cent for 
31.5 mm maximum size of aggregate and 6.0±1.5 per cent for 19 mm maximum size of 
aggregate. For 26.5 mm size of aggregates air content in the concrete shall be 5.0±1.5 per cent.
7.2.3	
When specific written authorization is granted to permit concreting at temperatures 
below those specified above, equipment to heat the aggregates and water shall have to 
be provided. In addition accelerating admixture can be used. The use of calcium chloride 
as an accelerator, or an accelerating admixture containing chloride can be permitted, if 
concrete does not have un-coated reinforcing steel. When concrete contains uncoated steel 
reinforcement, chlorides free accelerators e.g. calcium nitrite or calcium formate may be 
used.
7.2.4	
Concrete heating equipment capable of producing concrete that will have 
temperature of at least 15oC at the time of placing it between the forms shall be provided. 
The aggregates shall be heated prior to being loaded into the concrete mixer. The equipment 
used shall mix the mass uniformly and shall preclude the possible occurrence of overheated 
zones which might affect the concrete properties. Water used for mixing shall not be heated 
beyond 66oC. Material containing frost, ice, snow or lumps of hardened mass shall not be 
used. Heating methods which alter or prevent the entrainment of the required amount of air 
in the concrete shall not be adopted.
7.2.5	
During placement of concrete, tarpaulin covers or other such readily removable 
coverings should closely follow the placing of concrete, so that only a few meters of the 
finished slab are exposed to the outside air at any point of time. The coverings may be so 
arranged that heated air, when provided, could be freely circulated on top of the pavement. 
The coverings may be further covered by layers of straw or other insulating materials; no 
sooner the wet concrete is strong enough to take their load. 
7.2.6	
Any concrete damaged by frost action shall be removed and replaced.
7.2.7	
When the fresh concrete is likely to be subjected to freezing temperature in the 
nights, adequate measures are to be taken to protect the concrete from freezing by providing 



======================================================================

24
IRC:15-2017
thick mat of hey, two to three layers of Hessian, etc. The efficacy of this method should be 
checked by constructing trial sections.
7.3	
Frost Affected Areas
For moderate conditions, such as, those prevailing in areas at an altitude of 3,000 m and 
below, the thickness of frost affected depth will be about 450 mm. For protection against 
frost, the balance between the frost depth (450 mm) and total pavement thickness should 
be made up with non-frost susceptible material. In frost affected areas, the sub-base 
may consist of any of the specifications having the compressive strength of the stabilised 
or semi-rigid material cured in wet condition shall be at least 1.7 MPa at 7 days in the 
laboratory.
7.3.1	
For extreme conditions, such as, those prevailing in areas above an altitude of 
3,000 m, the foundation may be designed individually for every location after determining the 
depth of frost.
7.3.2	
The suggested criteria for the selection of non-frost susceptible materials are as 
follows: 
	
(i)	
Graded gravel: Not more than 8 per cent passing 75 micron IS sieve. 
Plasticity index not more than 6. Liquid limit not more than 25. 
	
(ii)	
Poorly graded sands: Generally, 100 per cent passing 4.75 mm sieve Max. 
10 per cent passing 75 micron sieve. 
	
(iii)	 Fine uniform sand: Generally, 100 per cent passing 425 micron IS sieve: 
Max. 18 per cent passing 75 micron IS sieve. 
8. JOINTS
8.1	
General
The location and type of joints shall be as shown in the drawings. Where semi-mechanised 
method of construction is used, the concrete along the face of all joints and around all tie 
bars and dowels shall be compacted with an internal vibrator inserted in the concrete and 
worked along the joint and around all tie bars and dowels to ensure a concrete free from 
honeycombing. It shall be ensured that vibrator should not contact the dowel bar, and the 
vibration operation does not misalign the dowels. In case of mechanised construction, 
working and their vibration/RPM of all the fixed vibrators shall be checked. There shall be 
two additional needle vibrators to compact the concrete near bulk head. Wherever, tie bars 
or dowel bars are inserted in the PQC, proper marking on the projecting surface of DLC will 
help to cut the joint at proper location.
Initial cut or a slot of 2.5 to 5 mm wide and having a depth equal to one-third to one-fourth the 
depth of the PQC slab at transverse and longitudinal joint is made as soon as the concrete 



======================================================================

======================================================================
25

IRC:15-2017
sets. Normally, in summer when ambient temperature is more than 30oC initial cutting may be 
carried after 4-8 hours of laying and in winter when ambient temperature is less than 30oC, 
initial cut may be done at 8-12 hours of laying. In any case initial cut of all the transverse 
and longitudinal joints shall be completed within 24 hours to avoid the random cracking. 
Subsequent widening of joint groove will be done after 14-16 days of casting concrete 
pavements. No sealing of joints shall be undertaken before 21 days of construction. All joints 
shall be sealed using sealants and joints shall be sealed when grooves are dry and clean 
and free from foreign object or loose material. Alternatively, compression seals or solid seals 
can also be used to seal the joints after initial cut without widening with the permission of 
Engineer. 
Joint cutting equipment which can be used to cut joint at the early age of concrete is called 
as early-entry saw. This is light weight equipment and has a plate on both sides of saw to 
keep concrete pressed at the location of saw cutting to basically control raveling. With use of 
early-entry joint cutting equipment, joints can be cut even earlier than that mentioned above 
using early-entry saw with the permission of the Engineer. Early-entry saw cutting are dry-
cuts so their blades are designed for use without water for cooling. The depth of cut shall be 
minimum 10 per cent subject to 30 mm minimum.
8.2	
Types of Joints
There are four types of joints (IRC:57). These are: 
	
(i)	
Expansion joint: Expansion joint provides the space into which pavement 
can expand thus relieving compressive stresses due to expansion and 
inhibiting any tendency towards buckling of concrete slabs.
	
(ii)	
Contraction joint: Contraction joint relieves tensile stresses in the concrete 
and prevents formation of irregular cracks due to restraint in free contraction 
of concrete. Contraction joints also relieve stresses due to warping.
	
(iii)	 Longitudinal joint: Longitudinal joint relieves stresses due to warping. 
These are commonly used for dividing the pavement into lanes when width 
of the slab becomes more than 4.5 m.
	
(iv)	 Construction Joint: Construction joints are provided whenever day’s 
construction operations start and stops/ends. These are full depth joints 
Construction should be so planned that days construction activity may end at 
the location of regular contraction joint. It may also be provided where paving 
stops for more than half an hour due to stoppage of work.
Figs. 2 to 5 show the location of contraction and longitudinal joints. All joints shall be carefully 
installed in accordance with the location and details given in the plans. The details of different 
types of joints, sealing groove, their plan, cross section etc., are shown in Figs. 6 to 10. For 
details IRC:57 may be referred.

Transverse Joints
8.3.1	
General
Transverse joints can be expansion, contraction or construction joints and shall be placed 
across the traffic direction as indicated on the drawing. These shall make a right angle with 
the centre line of the pavement. Contraction, construction and expansion joints shall be 
continuous from edge to edge of the pavement through all lanes constructed at the same 
or different times. These shall extend over the entire width of the pavement. The maximum 
transverse joint spacing shall be 4.5 m. 
Transverse joints shall be straight within the following tolerances along the intended line 
of joints which is the straight-line transverse to the longitudinal axis of the carriageway at 
the position proposed by the Engineer, except at road junctions or roundabouts where the 
position shall be as described in the drawings: 
	
(i)	
Deviations of the filler board in the case of expansion joints from the intended 
line of the joint shall not be greater than ± 10 mm. 
	
(ii)	
The best fit straight line through the joint grooves as constructed shall not be 
more than 25 mm from the intended line of the joint. 
	
(iii)	 Deviations of the joint groove from the best fit straight line of the joint shall 
not be greater than 10 mm. 
	
(iv)	 Transverse joints on each side of the longitudinal joint shall be in line with 
each other and of the same type and width. Transverse joints shall have a 
sealing groove which shall be sealed as per Clause 8.6 and 8.7.
	
(v)	
The transverse joints at curves shall be radial in the direction of the radius.
8.3.2	
Transverse Expansion Joints
They shall be of the dimensions and spacing as shown on the drawing. These shall be 
provided only where PQC abuts a bridge, under passes and culvert.

8.3.2.1	
There is no need to provide expansion joints at regular intervals but they are 
essential where cement concrete pavement is designed to abut with structures like bridges. 
It may sometime be necessary to provide more number of expansion joints in succession 
in such locations to release the pressure. Expansion joints against culverts, underpasses 
etc. having RCC box structure should normally be avoided by taking the PQC over the 
deck of such structures. To deal with the lack of compaction in the vicinity of structures and 
subsequent settlement, RCC approach slabs must be provided on both sides abutting with 
DLC layer. Wherever, PQC is taken over the deck of structures, underpasses etc., saw cut 
transverse construction joints must be provided just above the deck and approach slabs on 
both sides to avoid full depth transverse cracks in PQC.
8.3.2.2	
Dowel bars as per dimensions, location and spacing shown on the drawing are 
required at expansion joints to transfer wheel loads to the adjacent slab. For slabs of thickness 
less than 200 mm dowel bars may not be provided (IS:6509). The pre-moulded synthetic 
expansion joint filler board, a compressible material shall be used to fill the gap between 
adjacent slabs at expansion joint. The height of the filler board shall be such that its top is 
25 mm below the surface of the pavement. The accurate placing of dowels at the end of the 
day may be achieved by means of sufficiently strong bulkheads made of steel sections with 
holes drilled along the centre line to accommodate the dowel bars in a mild steel section 
and clamping arrangement not allowing displacement of bars while placing and compacting 
concrete. The bulkhead shall be oiled or greased before placing in position to avoid bonding with 
concrete. The top and bottom edges of the bulkheads and mild steel section shall be shaped to 
correspond to camber of the pavements at the joint. If considered convenient, two-piece split 
bulkheads may also be used. When dowel bars are provided, bulkheads shall be designed 
such that they can hold the projecting ends of the dowel bars to maintain their alignment 
and keep all bars parallel to each other. A box section normally is adopted for such designs. 
8.3.2.3	
The bulkheads shall be securely fixed in place at right angles to the centre line and 
surface of the pavement with sufficient stakes to hold them in the specified position. This may 
involve drilling of holes in sub-base to anchor the bulkhead with stakes. 
8.3.2.4	
Sealing grooves can be formed by placing wooden or PVC strips of 20-25 mm 
x 25 mm sections above the filler board. This can be pulled out when concrete sufficiently 
hardens. For easy removal of the wooden strip without damaging the edges, the sides of the 
strips may be shaped (tapered) suitably. 
8.3.2.5	
Under no circumstances shall any concrete be left above the expansion joint filler 
or across the joint at any point. Any concrete spanning the ends of the joint next to the forms 
shall be carefully cut away after the forms are removed.
8.3.3	
Contraction Joints
These shall be placed as shown on the drawing and shall be of the weakened plane of 
“dummy” groove type. The groove is formed preferably by a joint cutting saw. This groove 



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 96
======================================================================
34
IRC:15-2017
is subsequently widened and sealed with sealant as shown in Figs. 6 to 10. Alternatively, 
in case of semi-mechanised construction and minor works, the slot may be formed in a 
manner approved by the Engineer-in-Charge, such as, by pushing into the concrete a flat 
bar or plastic strip or the web of a “T” bar using a suitable vibratory device, removing the 
bar subsequently, and keeping the slot open. It shall be ensured that no spalling of concrete 
occurs while removing the bar. Such manually formed grooves are found to affect the riding 
quality of the pavement.
8.3.4	
Construction Joints
These shall be formed whenever placing of concrete is suspended for more than 30 minutes. 
Excepting in the case of emergency, construction shall always be suspended at the regular 
site of expansion or contraction joint. If the construction joint is located at the site of an 
expansion joint, regular expansion joint shall be provided; if at the site of a contraction joint 
or otherwise, the construction joint shall be of butt type with dowels. In case of emergency 
the joints should be placed only in the middle third of the specified contraction joint interval 
or slab length. 
At all construction joints, bulkhead shall be used to retain the concrete and care shall be taken 
in striking off and finishing the concrete surface to the top face of the bulkhead. When work 
is resumed, the surface of concrete laid subsequently, shall conform to the grade and cross-
section of previously laid pavement, and a straight edge 3 m in length shall be used parallel 
to the centre line of pavement, to check any deviation in the surface of the two sections. Any 
deviation from the general surface in excess of 3 mm shall be corrected.
8.3.5	
General Requirements of Transverse Joints
8.3.6	
Dowel Bars
Dowel bars shall be in accordance with details/dimensions as indicated in the drawing and 
free from oil, dirt, loose rust or scale. These shall be coated with appropriate anti-corrosive 
coating as per IS:13620. Coated bars should be protected from scratching during handling, 
and should be manually recoated by epoxy or anti-corrosive paint wherever scratches are 
observed. For uniformity in thickness of coating, the coating done in factory environment is 
preferable. Coating shall be done within 4 hours of cleaning of bars from all rust. Cleaning is 
done by sand/shot blasting. They shall be straight, free of irregularities and burring restricting 
free movement in the concrete. The sliding ends shall be sawn or cropped cleanly with no 
protrusions outside the normal diameter of the bar. The dowel bar shall be supported on 
cradles/dowel chairs in pre-fabricated joint assemblies positioned prior to the construction 
of the slabs or mechanically inserted by a Dowel Bar Inserter (DBI) with vibration into the 
plastic concrete by a method which ensures correct placement of the bars besides full re-
compaction of the concrete around the dowel bars. 
8.3.7	
Design of dowel bars has been given in IRC:58. The minimum length of dowel bar 
shall be 500 mm keeping in view the requirement of load transfer and placement errors. The 
diameter and spacing of dowels shall be designed as per IRC:58.



======================================================================


IRC:15-2017
8.3.8	
The dowel bars shall be aligned parallel to the finished surface of the slab and to 
the centre line of the carriageway and to each other within tolerances as given hereunder: 
	
(a)	
Horizontal or vertical rotational alignment ≤ 10 mm
	
(b)	
Longitudinal shift ≤ 50 mm
	
(c)	
Depth of dowel bar : mid-depth ± 25 mm
8.3.9	
Dowel bars shall be covered by a thin plastic sheath for at least 60 per cent of 
the length from one end for dowel bars in contraction joints or half the length plus 50 mm for 
expansion joints. The sheath shall be tough, durable, smooth, slide fit, and of an average 
thickness not greater than 0.5 mm and shall have closed end. The sheathed bar shall comply 
with the following pull out test.
8.3.10	
Four bars shall be taken at random from stock or without any special preparation 
shall be covered by sheaths as required. The ends of the dowel bars which have been 
sheathed shall be cast centrally into concrete specimens 150 x 150 x 600 mm, made of the 
same mix proportions to be used in the pavement, but with a maximum nominal aggregate 
size of 31.5 mm and cured in accordance with IS:516. At 7 days a tensile load shall be 
applied to achieve a movement of the bar of at least 0.25 mm. The average bond stress to 
achieve this movement shall not be greater than 0.14 MPa.
8.3.11	
For expansion joints, a closely fitting cap 100 mm long with closed end consisting 
of G1 pipe or stiff plastic of 2 mm thickness shall be placed over the sheathed end of each 
dowel bar. An expansion space at least equal in length to the thickness of the joint filler 
board shall be formed between the end of the cap and the end of the dowel bar by using 
compressible sponge. To block the entry of cement slurry between dowel and cap it may be 
taped all round. 
8.4	
Longitudinal Joints
8.4.1	
General
These joints are known as warping joints and can be formed by two different methods: (i) 
These can be of construction butt type formed by placing the concrete against the face of 
the slab cast earlier. The face of the slab cast earlier, shall be painted with bitumen before 
placing of fresh concrete. (ii) When a pavement of width of more than one lane is laid, the 
longitudinal joint may be cut by a joint cutting machine. In case of four lane divided road, 
when a two-lane carriageway (7.25/7.5 m wide) with tied shoulder (2.5 m wide) is laid using 
full width paver, then, two longitudinal saw cut joints shall be provided- one between the 
inner and outer lane and the other between outer lane and tied concrete shoulder (Fig. 3). 
In place of two longitudinal joints, one longitudinal joint may also be provided in the centre 
of carriageway dividing the carriageway into two equal parts of 4.875/5.0 m width as per the 
design recommended by the designer (Fig. 4).
8.4.2	
Tie bars
The bars shall be free from oil, dirt, loose rust and scale.



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 96
======================================================================
36
IRC:15-2017
8.4.3	
Tie bars are used across the longitudinal joints of concrete pavements to ensure 
firm contact between slab faces or to prevent abutting slabs from separating. Tie bars are not 
required for structural reasons, but their only function is to prevent separation of the slabs, 
especially at fills or curves. Tie bars are not designed to act as load transfer devices. Tie bars 
are designed to with stand tensile stresses only and provided at mid-depth.
8.4.4	
Tie bars projecting across the longitudinal joint shall be protected from corrosion 
for 75 mm on each side of the joint by a protective coating of bituminous paint. The coating 
shall be dry when the tie bars are used. 
8.4.5	
Tie bars shall be laid automatically in a fully mechanised construction using slip 
form paver. For semi mechanised construction tie bars shall be made up into rigid assemblies 
with adequate supports and fixings to remain firmly in position during the construction of the 
slab. Alternatively, tie bars at longitudinal joints may be mechanically or manually inserted 
into the plastic concrete from top by vibration using tie bar inserter. This method ensures 
correct placement of the bars and re-compaction of the concrete around the tie bars. When 
the pavement is constructed in single lane width, tie rods are also inserted mechanically or 
manually from sides. During side insertion in fixed form paving these may be bent so that 
half length remains along the form. After removal of forms, bars shall be straightened using 
hollow GI pipe so that they extend into the concrete placed on the other half of the concrete 
slab.
8.4.6	
Tie bars shall be positioned to remain within the middle third of the slab depth but 
well below the proposed sawing depth as indicated in the Fig. 7 (b), normally parallel to the 
surface and perpendicular to the line of the joint, with the centre of each bar on the intended 
line of the joints within a tolerance of 50 mm, and with a minimum cover of 30 mm below the 
joint groove. Typical tie bar details for use in double-lane rigid pavement with a lane width of 
3.5 m are given in Table 8.
8.5	
Arrangement of Different Types of Joints
8.5.1	
For more details about arrangement of the different types of joints, IRC:57 may be 
referred. The joint spacing at curve portion may be reduced by 20-30 per cent. In general, 
slab configuration is considered as 3.5 m x 4.5 m. The length of the slab shall be either more 
or equal to its width.
8.5.2	
Anchor Beam and Terminal Slab Adjoining Bridge Structures 
Cement concrete slab will expand during hot season and this will result in the building up 
of horizontal thrust on adjoining bridge structure. To contain this thrust RCC anchor beams 
are to be provided in the terminal slab. The grade of concrete for anchor beam shall be the 
same as for terminal slab. The terminal slab also needs to be provided with reinforcement 
to strengthen it. A typical arrangement of anchor beam and the terminal slab are shown in 
Fig.11. In case of culverts, etc. where the PQC slabs are provided above the superstructure, 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 96
======================================================================
37

IRC:15-2017
there is no need to construct anchor beam, approach slab and terminal slab. In case the PQC 
slab abuts with culvert structure, the construction of approach slab and terminal slab with 
anchor beam will be necessary.

8.6	
Preparation of Joint Grooves for Sealing
8.6.1	
Joint grooves are not constructed to provide the maximum width specified in the 
drawings when initial saw cut is made upto one-fourth to one-third of the slab depth. They 
shall be widened subsequently by sawing before sealing. Depth and width gauges shall be 
used to control the dimensions of the groove during widening process.
8.6.2	
If spalling occurs or the angle of the former is greater than 10 degrees, the joint 
sealing groove shall be sawn wider and perpendicular to the surface to encompass the 
defects up to a maximum width including any chamfer, of 12 mm for transverse joints and 
10 mm for longitudinal joints. If the spalling cannot be so eliminated then the arises shall be 
repaired by an approved thin bonded arises repair using cementitious materials, like, epoxy 
or polymer concrete.
8.6.3	
All grooves shall be cleaned of any dirt or loose material by air blowing with 
filtered, oil-free compressed air. If need arises, cleaning by pressurized water jets may be 
done depending upon the requirement of the sealant, the sides of the grooves may have to 
be sand blasted to increase the bondage between sealant and concrete. 
8.6.4	
The groove shall be cleaned and dried at the time of priming and sealing.
8.6.5	
Before sealing, the temporary seal inserted before subsequent widening for 
blocking the ingress of dirt, soil etc. shall be removed. A highly compressible heat resistant 
paper-backed debonding strip as per drawing/IRC: 57 shall be inserted in the groove to serve 
the purpose of breaking the bond between sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug 
the joint groove so that the sealant may not leak into the crack below. The width of debonding 
strip shall be slightly more than the joint groove width so that it is held tightly in the groove. 
In the case of hot sealant, heat resistant tapes may be inserted to block the leakage through 
bottom of the joint.
8.7	
Sealing with sealants
8.7.1	
When sealants are applied an appropriate primer shall also be used in accordance 
with the recommendation of the manufacturer. The sealant shall be applied within the minimum 
and maximum drying times of the primer. Priming and sealing with applied sealants shall not 
be carried out when the temperature of the pavement is below 7oC.
8.7.2	
If hot applied sealant is used, it shall be heated and applied (after using raker) 
from melter and pourer as shown in Figs. 12, 13 and 14. Hot sealants shall be rubberized 
bitumen type. The sealant shall be applied with extruder having flexible hose and nozzle. 
The sealant shall not be heated to a temperature higher than the safe heating temperature, 
as specified by the manufacturer. The dispenser shall be cleaned out at the end of each day 
in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and reheated material shall not be 
used.

8.7.3	
Cold applied sealants like, polysulphide/silicone/polyurethane or other similar 
material may be used as per IRC:57. These shall be mixed and applied within the time limit 
specified by the manufacturer. If primer is recommended it shall be applied neatly with an 
appropriate brush after cleaning the grooves/cut portion with compressed air. The Movement 
Accommodation Factor (MAF) shall be ± 10 per cent for bituminous sealant ± 25 per cent 
for poly sulphide sealant and for silicon sealant it shall be in the range of - 50 per cent to + 
100 per cent. Silicon sealant can be compressed to its 50 per cent size whereas it can be 
stretched to 100 per cent without any change in the volume of sealant.
8.7.4	
Movement Accommodation Factor (MAF) is defined as:
	
= (-) (Compressed Width – Original Width) X 100

8.7.5	
The groove configuration is different for poly-sulphide, silicone and polyurethane. 
Silicone, hardens by absorbing moisture from the air and hence it should be placed in a 
thinner layer vis-à-vis primer based poly-sulphide. Accordingly, the depth/width ratio of 
grooves should be modified. Besides the curing time of silicone is more than that of poly-
sulphide.
8.7.6	
The sealants applied during contraction phase of the slabs would result in bulging 
of the sealant over and above the slab. The right temperature and time for applying the 
sealant shall be as per manufacturer instructions. 
8.7.7	
Sealant shall be filled, slightly to a lower level than the slab top with a tolerance of 
3 ± 1 mm.
8.7.8	
During sealing operation, it shall be ensured that no air bubbles are introduced in 
the sealant either as vapours or voids by the sealing process.
8.7.9	
Preformed/premoulded neoprene seals shall not be used for sealing the joints 
as these can be very easily removed/stolen from the joint. Where there are no chances of 
theft like internal roads in premises, these seals can be permitted. Figs. 12 to 14 show the 
appliances used for joint sealing as per IRC:57 and IRC:43.

9. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF MATERIALS
9.1	
 General
A systems approach may be adopted for construction of the pavement. The Method 
Statement for carrying out the work, detailing all the activities including indication of time-
cycle for equipment, personnel, etc. These shall be got approved from the Engineer before 
the commencement of the work. The above shall include the type, capacity and make of 
the batching and mixing plant besides the hauling arrangement so that paving can progress 
without any stoppage. During planning stage, it should be noted that constructing multi-lane 
pavement is better than constructing single lane at a time from the point of view of riding 
quality. Therefore, the capacity of plants should be planned accordingly. 
9.2	
Storage and Handling of Cement
9.2.1	
The requirement of cement being of a very high, cement is normally stored in large 
capacity horizontal/vertical silos. Cement is carted in bulk to feed the storage silos. In the case 
of small projects involving manual or semi-mechanised paving cement in bags may be used.
9.2.2	
Supply of cement should be co-ordinated such that its long period of storage is 
avoided. Its procurement and consumption should be planned so that it is not stored right 
through the rainy season. Cement having lumps which have been caused due to improper 
storage or by pressure due to over-loading of bags shall not be considered for use unless 
these lumps can be easily powdered with pressure between fingers. Before such cement is 
used, representative sample containing the lumps in fair proportion also shall be taken and 
tested to fulfil the minimum requirements. Any cement stored more than 3 months, or more 
than 6 weeks during monsoon, shall be tested for its acceptance and also for revalidation of 
mix design.
9.2.3	
Owing to the slightly deliquescent nature of rapid hardening cement and 53 grade 
cement, special care should be taken in its storage and in any case, it should not be stored 
for longer than three months. 
9.3	
Storage and Handling of Aggregates
9.3.1	
The location and preparation of sites, minimum size of stack and the methods 
adopted for dumping and stacking to prevent segregation of coarse and fine material shall be 
subjected to the approval of the Engineer. Aggregates stock piles may be made on ground 
if it is denuded of vegetation, levelled, compacted with good quality soil sub-base material 
and well drained. Aggregates near the bottom of the heap may get mixed with soil and shall 
not be used without washing. Aggregates from different sources and/or of different grading 
shall not be stacked together. Each size of coarse aggregate shall be stacked separately 
and separate wooden or steel partition shall be provided to avoid intermixing. The storing of 
aggregates upon the carriageway or shoulders shall not be permitted. 



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 96
======================================================================
43

IRC:15-2017
9.3.2	
If aggregates are stored in conical stacks, segregation will be increased by the 
rolling of the coarser particles down the sides of the stacks. To avoid this, stacks should be 
built up in approximately horizontal layers. Dry fine aggregate get blown away easily; it may 
be helpful to moisten the aggregates stacked in heaps on the ground. 
9.3.3	
Sufficient quantity of aggregates should be available in stock so that there is 
adequate supply of requisite aggregates is available. Stock piling aggregates for use beyond 
2-3 months should be done cautiously as it is likely to be contaminated with dust and foreign 
matter. 
9.3.4	
The aggregates shall be handled form the stacks and fed into the mixer in such 
a manner as to secure the stipulated grading of the material. Aggregates that have become 
mixed with earth or other foreign material shall not be used. They shall be washed clean 
before use. The aggregates contaminated with fine dust, etc. are normally screened with a 
mobile screening plant before use. 
9.4	
Batching of Materials
9.4.1	
All batching of materials shall be by weight. After determining the proportion of 
ingredients for the field mix, the fine aggregate and each separated size of coarse aggregate 
shall be proportioned by weight in a calibrated and approved weigh-batching plant and placed 
into the hopper of the mixer along with the necessary quantity of cement.
10. CONSTRUCTION
10.1	
Fully Mechanised Construction
10.1.1	
General
The batching plant shall include minimum four bins, weighing hoppers, and scales for the 
fine aggregate and for each size of coarse aggregate. More bins may be required to handle 
mineral admixtures like fly ash, GGBFS and also different types of sand like fine, coarse and 
crushed etc. If cement is used in bulk, a separate scale for cement shall be included. The 
weighing hoppers shall be properly sealed and vented to preclude dust during operation. 
Approved safety devices shall be provided and maintained for the protection of all personnel 
engaged in plant operation, inspection and testing. The batch plant shall be equipped with 
a suitable non-resettable batch counter which will correctly indicate the number of batches 
proportioned. The batch mixing plant and concrete production shall be confirming to the 
requirements of IS:4929 and IRC:SP:96.
10.1.2	
Bins and hoppers
Bins with minimum four numbers of adequate separate compartments shall be provided in 
the batching plant.

IRC:15-2017
10.1.3	
Automatic weighing devices
Batching plant shall be equipped to proportion aggregates and bulk cement by means of 
automatic weighing devices using load cells.
The batching plant shall have facility for adding at least two admixtures in the mixing pan.
The discharging mechanism shall have appropriate chutes, down pipes, etc. so that the 
discharged mix will not get segregated.
10.1.4	
Control Cabin
An air-conditioned centralised control cabin shall be provided for automatic operation of the 
equipment.
10.1.5	
Batching by weight only is recommended.
10.1.6	
The location of the batching plant is an important issue to be looked into while 
planning the project. As there is a limitation on using the concrete mix after adding the water 
within a stipulated time, the mix shall not normally be carried beyond 15 km of lead on a 
maintained road not requiring more than 40 minutes of travel time. Therefore, the location 
of the batching plant in a road project has to be decided carefully. The travel time from plant 
to construction site should be considered while designing the concrete mix for loss of slump 
during travel. 
10.1.7	
Mixing 
10.1.7.1	
General
The mixing of concrete shall be done in a plant equipped with appropriate mixture which will 
ensure a uniform distribution of materials throughout the mass so that the mix is uniform in 
colour and homogeneous. All concrete shall be mixed in quantities for immediate use.
10.1.7.2	
Mixers
Generally mixers shall be pan type, reversible type with single or twin shaft or any other mixer 
capable of efficiently mixing the aggregates, cement, water and admixtures into a thoroughly 
mixed and uniform concrete within the specific mixing period, and discharging the mixture, 
without segregation. In twin shaft mixer, mixing time is normally very low (about 6 m3 may be 
mixed in 20-30 seconds). Hydrometers for the measurement of the density of the admixtures 
shall be available at site. Each stationary mixer shall be equipped with an approved timing 
device which will automatically lock the discharge lever when the drum has been charged 
and release it at the end of the mixing period. The device shall be equipped with a bell or 
other suitable warning device adjusted to give a clearly audible signal each time the lock is

released. In case of failure of the timing device, the mixer may be used for the balance of the 
day while it is being repaired, provided that each batch is mixed for 60 seconds. The mixer 
shall be equipped with a suitable non-resettable batch counter which shall correctly indicate 
the number of batches mixed.
The mixers shall be cleaned at suitable intervals or whenever mixing is suspended for about 
an hour or more. The pickup and throw-over blades in the drum or drums shall be repaired 
or replaced when they are worn down by 20 mm or more. The Contractor shall (1) have at 
the job site a copy of the manufacturer’s design, showing dimensions and arrangements of 
blades in reference to original height and depth, or (2) provide permanent marks on blade to 
show points of 20 mm wear from new conditions. Drilled holes of 5 mm diameter near each 
end and at midpoint of each blade are recommended. Batching plant shall be calibrated for 
the each ingredient up to its maximum quantity being used in the mix at site in the beginning 
and thereafter at suitable interval not exceeding one month.
10.1.7.3	
The mixer shall be equipped with an approved water measuring device capable of 
accurate measurement of water required per batch. The mixer shall preferably be equipped 
with a mechanically operated pump for filling the mixer tank.
10.1.7.4	
The mixer shall normally be equipped with a timing device which will automatically 
lock the discharge lever during the full time of mixing and release it at the end of the mixing 
period. The device shall also be equipped with a bell, adjusted to ring each time the lock 
is released. If the timing device gets broken or out of order, the mixer will be permitted to 
be used while the same is being repaired, provided an approved time-piece equipped with 
minute and second hands is provided. 
10.1.7.5	
Spilling of the materials at either end of the mixer shall be corrected by reducing 
the size of the batch and in no case, shall the volume of the mixed material per batch exceed 
the manufacturer’s guaranteed capacity of the mixer. The type, size and number of mixers 
shall be so chosen as to provide the required output without overloading.
10.1.7.6	
The mixing speed of the drum shall not be less than 15 revolutions per minute nor 
the peripheral speed of the drum greater than 60 m per minute.
10.1.7.7	
The sequence of loading shall be coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, cement, 
fly ash/GGBFS or any other such mineral admixture if used. After dry mixing, water will be 
released from venture-meter. The superplasticizer mixed with the recommended percentage 
of water shall be added in the last. The quantities are to be programmed in the computer 
accordingly.
10.1.7.8	
The skip shall be so maintained and operated that each batch will be completely 
discharged into the mixing drum at the loading of the mixer.

IRC:15-2017
10.1.8	
Time of Mixing
The mixing of each batch will continue for 60 seconds after all the materials are discharged 
into the mixer or as recommended by the manufacturer of the plant and to the satisfaction of 
the Engineer. 
10.1.9	
Retempering
The retempering of concrete, i.e., remixing of concrete stiffened due to delay in placement 
with or without additional cement, aggregate or water shall not be permitted. 
10.1.10	
Hauling of Concrete
Freshly mixed concrete from the central batching and mixing plant shall be transported to the 
paver site by means of trucks/tippers of sufficient capacity in adequate numbers to ensure 
a constant supply of concrete. Tarpaulin covers shall be used for protection of concrete 
against the weather. The tipper trucks shall be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete 
in a homogeneous state and discharging the same without segregation and loss of cement 
slurry. The feeding to the paver, when used, is to be regulated in such a way that the paving 
is done in an uninterrupted manner with a uniform speed throughout the day’s work. 
10.1.11	
Placing of Concrete
The total time taken from the addition of the water to the mix, until the completion of the 
surface finishing and texturing shall not exceed 120 minutes when concrete temperature 
is less than 25 oC and 90 minutes when the concrete temperature is more than 25 oC. If 
possible, Trucks/Tippers delivering concrete shall not run directly on plastic sheet nor shall 
they run on completed slabs until after 28 days of placing of concrete. 
The concrete shall be deposited without segregation in front of slip form paver across the 
whole width and to a height which at all times is in excess of the required surcharge. The 
deposited concrete shall be struck off to the necessary average and differential surcharge by 
means of the strike off plate/metering gate and a screw auger device/plough extending across 
the whole width of the slab. The equipment for striking off the concrete shall be capable of 
being rapidly adjusted for changes of the average and differential surcharge necessitated by 
change in slab thickness or cross fall.
10.1.12	
Equipment
The concrete shall be placed with an approved fixed form or slip form paver with independent 
units designed to (i) spread, (ii) consolidate from the mould, screed and float-finish, (iii) 
texture and spray curing compound on the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass 
of the machine in such a manner that a minimum of hand finishing will be necessary and 
so as to provide a dense and homogeneous pavement in conformity with the design and 
specifications. The paver shall be equipped with electronic sensors to pave the slab to the 
required thickness, camber, grade and alignment in the case of slip form pavers.

10.1.12.1	 Paver shall have a dowel bar inserter to place the dowel bars at the time of laying of 
concrete. Dowel bar inserter should be capable of holding the dowels properly while inserting 
them. Insertion mechanism shall ensure proper consolidation of concrete around the inserted 
bars. If paver with dowel bar inserter is not available then dowels may be placed on baskets/

It is very important to check the position and alignment of placed dowels to control any 
joint failure in future. The alignment of dowel bars should be assessed using Magnetic 
Pulse Induction (MPI) device as per ASTM E3013/E3013M – 15. The MPI device can check 
efficiently and accurately the dowel alignment within few hours of concrete placement. The 
engineer should check the MPI report of each joint in the beginning to locate the joints of 
possible failure and correct them at the earliest. Later on if the engineer is satisfied with the 
MPI report, the checking frequency may be reduced to 25 per cent of joints. 
10.1.12.2	 Use of Guidewires
Where slip form paving is proposed, a guidewire shall be provided along both sides of the slab. 
Each guidewire shall be at a constant height above and parallel to the required edges of the 
slab as described in the contract/drawing within a vertical tolerance of ± 2 mm. Additionally, 
one of the wires shall be kept at a constant horizontal distance from the required edge of the 
pavement as indicated in the contract/drawing within a lateral tolerance of ± 10 mm.



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 96
======================================================================
48
IRC:15-2017
10.1.12.3	 The guidewires shall be supported on stakes not more than 6 m apart by connectors 
capable of fine horizontal and vertical adjustment. The stake to stake distance in case of 
paving at curve shall suitably be decreased. The guidewires shall be tensioned on the stakes 
so that a 500 gm weight shall produce a deflection of not more than 20 mm when suspended 
at the midpoint between any pair of stakes. The ends of the guidewires shall be anchored to 
fixing point or winch and not on the stakes.
10.1.12.4	 The stakes shall be positioned and the connectors maintained at their correct 
height and alignment 12 hours before concreting takes place and until 12 hours after finishing 
of the concrete. The guidewires shall be checked and tensioned on the connectors at any 
section at least 2 hours before concreting that section.
10.1.12.5	 The Engineer shall inspect and approve the line and level, the stakes and 
connectors which are ready for use in the length of road to be constructed at least 12 hours 
before the day of construction of slab. Any deficiencies noted by the Engineer shall be 
rectified. Engineer shall also check the level before the commencement of work. Work shall 
not proceed until the Engineer has given his approval. It shall be ensured that the stakes and 
guidewires are not affected by the construction equipment when concreting is in progress. 
Arrangements should be readily available to correct it in case the string line is inadvertently 
disturbed.
10.1.12.6	 Use of 3D Pave System (String less Paving)
Instead of using guidewires, the concrete should preferably be paved with slip form pavers 
fitted with latest 3D Pave system based on Total Station. This system ensures very high level 
of accuracy in elevation, slope, automatic steering of the paver, and better riding quality.
10.1.13	
Construction by Slip Form Paver
10.1.13.1	 The slip form paving train (Fig. 16) shall consist of self-propelled paver machine 
(2/3/4 Tracks) which spreads, compacts and finishes the concrete in a continuous operation. 
The slip form paving machine shall compact the concrete by internal vibration and shape it 
between the side forms with either a conforming plate or by vibrating and oscillating finishing 
beams. 
10.1.13.2	 The level of the conforming plate and finishing beams shall be controlled 
automatically from the guidewires installed as per Clause 10.1.12.2 by sensors attached 
at the four corners of the slip form paving machine. The alignment of the paver shall be 
controlled automatically from the guidewires by at least one set of sensors attached to the 
paver. The alignment and level of ancillary machines for finishing, texturing and curing of the 
concrete shall be automatically controlled relative to the guidewires or to the surface and 
edge of an adjoining hardened slab.

10.1.13.3	 Slip form paving machines shall have vibrators of variable frequency and power, 
with a maximum energy output of not less than 2.5 KW per metre width of slab per 300 mm 
depth of slab for a laying speed up to 1.5 m per minute. The machines shall be of sufficient 
mass to provide adequate reaction during spreading and paving operations on the traction 
units to maintain forward movements during the placing of concrete in all situations. 
The vibratory trails are resulted when vibrators vibrate at a very high frequency. To avoid 
vibratory trails, the frequency of vibrators should be adjustable in the range of 8000 to 
10000 HZ at a paving speed of 0.8 to 1.0 m/minute. 
The paver should have a vibrator sensing system to provide a real time readout of vibration 
frequency for all of the vibrators and to give an alarming signal to the operator in case of high 
or low frequencies or total loss of vibration. The variable vibration setting shall be provided 
in the machine. Hand held device may also be used for checking the vibration periodically.
Fig. 16. A View of Slip Form Paving Train
10.1.13.4	 If the edges of the slip formed slab slump to the extent that the surface of the top 
edge of the slab does not comply with the requirements then special measures approved by 
the Engineer shall be taken to support the edges to the required levels and work shall be 
stopped until such time as the Contractor can demonstrate his ability to slip form the edges 
to the required levels. The slumped edge shall have to be corrected by adding fresh concrete 
after roughening the surface. 
10.1.13.5	 The pace of construction of slabs shall desirably not be less than 0.5 to 1 m 
per minute. The capacity of the batching plant should be sufficiently more than this requirement 
so that the paver remains in motion without stoppage for want of mix. This factor is essential 
for achieving better riding quality.

10.1.14	
Surface Texture
10.1.14.1	 Tining
After final floating and finishing of the slab and before application of the liquid curing 
membrane preferably two coats, the surface of concrete slabs shall be textured either in the 
transverse direction (i.e., at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the road) or in longitudinal 
direction (i.e., parallel to the centerline of the roadway). The texturing shall be done by tining 
the finished concrete surface by using rectangular steel tines. A beam or a bridge mounted 
with steel tines shall be equipped and operated with automatic sensing and control devices 
from main paver or auxiliary unit. The tining unit shall have facility for adjustment of the 
download pressure on the tines as necessary to produce the desired finish. The tining rakes 
shall be cleaned often to remove snots of slurry. The tines will be inspected daily and all the 
damaged and bent tines shall be replaced before commencing texturing. Tined grooves shall 
be 3 mm wide and 3 to 4 mm deep. Before commencing texturing, the bleeding water, if any, 
shall be removed or allowed to disappear and texturing shall be done on a firm surface. The 
measurement of texture depth shall be done with depth measuring gauge/device. 
(a)	
Transverse Tining:
When the texturing is specified in transverse direction, a beam of at least 3 m length mounted 
with tines shall be moved in transverse direction to produce the texture. The grooves produced 
shall be at random spacing of grooves but uniform in width and depth. The spacing shall 
conform to a pattern shown below:

The above pattern shall be repeated. Texturing shall be done at the right time such that the 
grooves after forming shall not close and they shall not get roughened. Swerving of groove 
patterns will not be permitted. The completed textured surface shall be uniform in appearance. 
(b)	
Longitudinal Tining
Longitudinal tining shall be done, if specified in the Contract. The texturing bridge shall be 
wide enough to cover the entire width of the carriageway but within 75 mm from the pavement 
edge. The centre to centre spacing between the tines shall be 18 to 21 mm. The width of tine 
texture shall be 3 mm and depth shall be 3 to 4 mm.
10.1.14.2	 Brush Texturing
Alternatively, the brush texturing may be applied. The brushed surface texture shall be 
applied evenly across the slab in one direction by the use of a wire brush not less than 
450 mm wide but wider brushes normally of 3 m length are preferred. The brush shall be 
made of 32 gauge tape wires grouped together in tufts placed at 10 mm centres. The tufts 
shall contain an average of 14 wires and initially be 100 mm long. The brush shall have 
two rows of tufts. The rows shall be 20 mm apart and the tufts in one row shall be opposite

IRC:15-2017
the centre of the gap between tufts in the other row. The brush shall be replaced when the 
shortest tuft wears down to 90 mm long.
The texture depth shall be determined by the Sand Patch Test. This test shall be performed at 
least once for each day’s paving and wherever the Engineer considers it necessary at times 
after construction as under:
Five individual measurements of the texture depth shall be taken at least 2 m apart anywhere 
along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart along the pavement. 
No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edges of a concrete slab 
constructed in one pass. After the application of the brushed texture, the surface of the slab 
shall have a uniform appearance.
Texture depths shall not be less than the minimum required when measurements are taken 
as given in Table 9 nor greater than a maximum average of 1.25 mm.

Where the texture depth requirements are found to be deficient, the Contractor shall make 
good the texture across the full lane width over length, by retexturing the hardened concrete 
surface in an approved manner.
The edges of the concrete slabs shall be rounded after texturing using an arising tool having 
a radius of 3 mm diligently without applying pressure to the surface to leave the pavement 
edges smooth and true to line. 
10.1.14.3	 Measurement of texture depth-sand patch method
The following apparatus shall be used:
	
(1)	
A cylindrical container of 25 ml internal capacity.
	
(2)	
A flat wooden disc 64 mm diameter with a hard rubber disc. 1.5 mm thick, 
struck to one face, the reverse face being provided with a handle. 
	
(3)	
Dry natural sand with a rounded particle shape passing a 300 micron 
IS sieve and retained on a 150 micron IS sieve. 
The surface to be measured shall be dried, any extraneous mortar and loose material 
removed and the surface swept clean using a wire brush both at right angles and parallel 
to the carriageway. The cylindrical container shall be filled with the sand, tapping the base 



======================================================================

52
IRC:15-2017
3 times on the surface to ensure compaction, and striking off the sand level with the top of the 
cylinder. The sand shall be poured into a heap on the surface to be treated. The sand shall be 
spread over the pavement surface, working the disc with its face kept flat in a circular motion 
so that the sand is spread into a circular patch with the surface depressions filled with sand 
to the level of peaks.
The diameter of the patch shall be measured to the nearest 5 mm. The texture depth of 
concrete surface shall be calculated from 31000/(DxD) mm where D is the diameter of the 
patch in mm.
10.2	
Semi-Mechanised Construction Technique
10.2.1	
General
Use of very sophisticated paving machines and high capacity concrete batch mixer may not 
be possible in every road projects and also in remote hilly terrains or near bridge structures. 
The concrete roads can be constructed using semi-mechanised but the resulting quality 
and surface may not be the same as achieved with mechanised constructions and shall be 
allowed in case of exceptional circumstances.
10.2.2	
Forms
In large sized projects, it is common to use slip form paving technique where no side forms 
are necessary to retain the mould of green concrete slab. The fixed-forms made of steel 
channels or fabricated steel sections are generally made use of. Fixed forms shall be at least 
100-150 m length.
10.2.3	
Steel Forms
The steel forms shall be mild steel channel sections of depth equal to the thickness of the 
pavement or a few millimetres less than the thickness of the pavement to match with the plus 
level tolerances specified for sub-base. In the latter case, the forms shall be levelled by using 
metal wedges or shims. The thickness of flange and web of steel forms shall not be less than 
6 mm and shall be capable of resisting all loads applied in the paving process. The length of 
form shall not be less than 3.5 m except in the case of installations along curves.
If the channel depth required is other than the standard rolled sections available, it shall be 
fabricated. The channel section or steel forms shall have fixing arrangement to keep them in 
position and enable to resist horizontal pressure of concrete.
10.2.4	
The sections shall have a length of at least 3 m except on curves of less than 
45 m radius, where shorter lengths may be used. When set to grade and staked in place, 
the maximum deviation of the top surface of any section from a straight line shall not exceed 
2 mm in the vertical plane and 5 mm in the horizontal plane. The method of connection 
between sections shall be such that the joint formed shall be free from difference in level, 
play or movement in any direction. The use of bent, twisted or worn-out forms will not be 



======================================================================


IRC:15-2017
permitted. At least three stake pickets for each 3 m of form and the bracing and support must 
be ample to prevent springing of the forms under the pressure of concrete or the weight or 
thrust of machinery operating on the forms. 
10.2.5	
The supply of forms shall be sufficient to permit their remaining in place for minimum 
12 hours after the concrete has been placed. Any unevenness in the form work particularly 
the top will affect riding quality. After removing the form, the edge shall be protected from 
damage till concrete attains enough strength.
10.2.6	
Setting of Forms
The forms shall be jointed neatly and shall be set with exactness to be required grade and 
alignment. Both before and after the forms are placed and set, the sub-base under the forms 
shall be thoroughly tamped in an approved manner. Sufficient rigidity shall be obtained to 
support the forms in such a position that during the entire operation of compacting and 
finishing of concrete they shall not at any time deviate more than 2 mm from a straight edge 
3 m in length. Forms which show a variation from the required rigidity or alignment and levels 
shown in the drawing, shall be reset or removed, as directed. The length and number of 
stakes shall be such as to maintain the forms at the correct line and grade. All forms shall be 
cleaned and oiled each time before they are used. Forms shall be set ahead of the actual 
placing of concrete for the entire day’s work. 
10.2.7	
Placement of Steel
In placing reinforcing steel, the portion of concrete below 50-60 mm shall be struck off to 
the entire width of the slabs and of sufficient length to permit sheet or mat of reinforcement 
to be laid full length without further manipulations of the reinforcement. Displacement of the 
reinforcement during concreting operations shall be prevented.
10.2.8	
Tools, Plants and Equipment
The requirements of concrete quality in road construction being large which again is to be 
supplied continuously, the mixes are normally to be produced from mixers. The plants and 
equipment considered essential even in semi-mechanized construction are:
	
(i)	
A couple of tilting type drums mixers of at least 0.2 cum capacity. The number 
of mixers to be employed in a project shall be decided on the basis of days 
work.
	
(ii)	
Vibrating screeds for tamping and compacting pavement surface. These 
are moved on the leveled fixed forms or side forms to achieve the required 
smoothness, grade and surface regularity.
	
(iii)	 A couple of needle vibrators. Alternatively, fixed pavers fitted with vibrators 
and finisher can also be used.
	
(iv)	 Concrete-saw-this is required for forming contraction joints in a continuously 
constructed lane.



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 96
======================================================================
54
IRC:15-2017
	
(v)	
Hand held sprayer for applying liquid curing compound at least 10-20 kg 
capacity container/tank. 
	
(vi)	 Texturing broom
	
(vii)	 Straight edges of 3 m length.
	
(viii)	 Appropriate tools for sealing joints.
	
(ix)	 Stop-end and start-end made of steel or wooden sections or bulk heads. 
These gadgets are required for commencing and stopping paving activity.
10.2.9	
Hauling of Mix
Transporting of concrete mix from mixer to paving site with steel pans is not permitted. Only 
wheel-barrows or trolleys are to be used for carrying mix to the paving site. The workability of 
the mix can be controlled better with the use of wheel-barrows.
10.2.10	
Placing of Concrete
Where semi-mechanised construction technique is adopted, concrete shall be deposited 
between the forms directly from head loads or wheel barrows. Where a certain amount of 
redistribution is necessary, it shall be done with shovels and not with rakes. The concrete shall 
be compacted with needle vibrators and vibrating screeds in semi-mechanised construction 
where a paver finisher is not available. Use of vibrator near side forms is essential to eliminate 
honey combing. To effect adequate compaction, the concrete shall be placed with appropriate 
surcharge over the final slab thickness. The amount of surcharge will depend on the mode 
of placement of concrete and shall be determined by trial. In general, the required surcharge 
is about 20 per cent of the required slab thickness. Any portion of the batch of concrete that 
becomes segregated while depositing it on sub-base shall be thoroughly mixed with the main 
body of the batch during the process of spreading. In case of unavoidable interruption, a full 
depth transverse joint shall be made at the point of stoppage of work provided the section on 
which the work has been suspended is about 2 to 3 m long.
10.2.11	
Compaction
Where semi-mechanized technique is adopted, compaction of the pavement shall be 
accomplished by a vibrating screed supplemented by plate/internal vibrators. For slabs of 
thickness more than 125 mm, vibrating screeds may be supplemented by needle vibrators. 
The vibrating screed shall rest on side forms. It shall be lowered vertically on to the concrete 
surface, evenly spread to the appropriate level above the base to provide the required 
surcharge for compaction; allowed to remain in position for a few seconds until compaction 
is complete, then lifted vertically and lowered to the adjacent strip of un-compacted concrete. 
The amplitude of vibration of the screed shall not be less than 1.5 mm and the speed of travel 
not more than 0.6 m per minute. The screed shall again be taken slowly over the surface, 
sliding with its axis slightly tilted away from the direction of sliding and the operation repeated 
until the required dense and closed surface is obtained. Compaction of concrete slabs up 
to 125 mm thickness may be done by means of vibrating screed alone. Even in the case of 



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 96
======================================================================
55

IRC:15-2017
slabs of lower thickness, internal vibrators may be used with advantage of compacting the 
slab corners and edges. The working of the vibrators shall be regularly checked and stand 
by shall always be maintained for emergency use. Segregated particles of coarse aggregate 
which collect in front of the screed shall be discarded. Under no circumstances shall such 
segregated particles be carried forward and pushed on to the base in front of the mass. 
Compaction by screeding shall be carried on till the mortar in the mix just works up to the 
surface. Care shall be exercised and the operation of tamping so controlled as to prevent an 
excess of mortar and water from being worked on the top. Repeated operation other than 
to secure the necessary compaction and to eliminate voids shall be avoided. Immediately 
after the screening has been completed and before the concrete has hardened, i.e. while 
the concrete is still in the plastic stage, the surface shall be inspected for irregularities with a 
profile checking template and any needed correction made by adding or removing concrete 
followed by further compaction and finishing.
10.2.12	
Floating
As soon as practicable after the concrete has been compacted, its surface shall be smoothened 
by means of a longitudinal float, operated from a foot-bridge. The longitudinal float shall be 
worked with a sawing motion, while held in a floating position parallel to the carriageway 
centre line and passed gradually from one side of the pavement to the other. Movements 
ahead along the centre line of the carriageway shall be in successive advances of not more 
than one half the length of the float. This process may also be carried out in slip form or fixed 
form paving method.
10.2.13	
Forms shall not be removed from freshly placed concrete until it has set, or at 
least 12 hours, whichever is later. They shall be carefully removed in such a manner that no 
damage is done to the edges of the pavement. After the forms have been removed, the slab 
edges shall be cleaned and any limited honey-combed areas pointed up with 1:4 cement and 
sand mortar, after which the sides of the slab shall be covered with wet hessian for curing. 
Slabs with excessive honey-combing as a result of inadequate compaction shall be removed 
up to the nearest transverse joints.
10.2.14	
Straight Edging
After the longitudinal floating has been completed, the excess water has disappeared, and 
while the concrete is still plastic and before it begins to set, the slab surface shall be tested 
for trueness with a 3 m straight edge and graduated wedge gauge. The straight edge shall 
be held in successive positions parallel to the road centre line in contact with the surface and 
the whole area gone over from one side of the slab to the other. Advance along the road shall 
be in successive stages of not more than one-half length of the straight edge. Any area of 
depression found shall be scooped to a depth of 40-50 mm, compacted, and refinished. High 
areas shall be cut down and refinished. The straight edging and refloating shall continue until 
the entire surface is found to be free from observable departures from the straight edge and 
the slab has the required grade and camber.



======================================================================

IRC:15-2017
10.2.15	
The straight edge shall be placed on the surface in successive positions, parallel 
to the carriageway centre line. Irregularities shall be measured with the help of the wedge 
gauge moved transversely at various points until it touches both the straight edge and the 
concrete surface.
10.2.16	
At any point tested, the concrete shall not show a departure greater than 
3 mm from the true surface. If at any place the departure exceeds this value, not more than 
3 passes of the vibrating screed shall be allowed and the surface tested again in the specified 
manner. If the irregularity still exceeds the limit aforesaid, the concrete shall be removed to 
a depth of 50 mm or upto the top surface of the reinforcement, if any. The area of concrete 
to be removed shall be demarcated by the length of the straight edge in the position of 
measurement across the full width of the slab. The concrete so removed shall not be re-used 
in the carriageway. Fresh concrete shall be placed, compacted and finished in the manner 
already described in these specifications and shall again be subject to test for accuracy of 
finish.
10.2.17	
Although, the concrete may be removed immediately following measurement of 
the irregularity and while it is still wet, this shall not mean any waiver from complying with 
the requirements of this clause, if for any reason the concrete is to be removed which has 
already hardened.
10.2.18	
After straight edging of the surface, it shall be finished by belting and brooming.
10.2.19	
Texturing
Just before the concrete becomes non-plastic, the surface shall be textured by tining with 
appropriate machine. 
10.2.20	
Edging
After tining have been completed, but before the concrete has taken its initial set, the edges 
of the slab shall be carefully finished with an edging or arising tool of 3 mm radius and 
conforming to the requirements laid down in IRC:43 so as to leave the pavement edges 
smooth and true to line.
10.3	
Construction by Semi Mechanized Fixed Form Paving Train
In this case, laying of PQC is similar to semi-mechanised construction technique, however, 
the paving train moves on the rails fixed on both sides of the road and compaction/finishing is 
simultaneously carried with the equipments fitted with paving train which moves on the rails. 
The method of texturing, curing, joint cutting is also similar to semi mechanised construction. 
The fixed form paving train therefore, shall consist of separate powered machines which 
spread, compact and finish the concrete in a continuous operation. A fixed form paver 
essentially should have following features:



======================================================================

•	
It should have power arrangement for its forward movement.
	
•	
It moves either on side steel forms firmly fixed to the sub-base or on rails 
fixed on both sides of the forms.
	
•	
It should have augurs for spreading, needle vibrators for compacting and 
roller for finishing the concrete surface. The roller may also have vibration 
during rolling the concrete surface.
A typical fixed form paver fitted with vibrators and a roller for finishing is shown in Fig. 17.
Fig. 17 Fixed Form Paver with Vibrators and Roller
10.3.1	
Side Forms, Rails and Guidewires
All side forms or rails shall be of mild steel of suitable depth so that desired depth of PQC is 
obtained. The forms can be placed on a series of steel packing plates or shims to take care of 
irregularity of sub-base. They shall be sufficiently robust with a minimum thickness of 6 mm 
and rigid to support the weight and pressure exerted by the paving equipment. 
10.3.2	
Side forms for use with wheeled paving machines shall incorporate metal rails 
firmly fixed at a constant height below the top of the forms. The forms and rails shall be firmly 
secured in position by not less than 3 stakes/pins per 3 m length so as to prevent movement 
in any direction. Forms and rails shall be straight within a tolerance of 3 mm in 3 m and when 
in place shall not settle in excess of 1.5 mm in 3 m while paving is being done. Forms shall 
be cleaned and oiled immediately before each use. Fig. 18 shows the plan and elevation of 
side forms laterally supported by bracings.

======================================================================
58
IRC:15-2017
Fig. 18 Plan and Elevation of Side forms Laterally Supported by Bracings
10.3.3	
The forms shall be bedded on a continuous bed of lean cement mortar or concrete 
and set to the line and levels shown on the drawings within tolerances 5 mm and 2 mm 
respectively. The bedding shall not extend under the slab and there shall be no vertical 
step between adjacent forms of more than 2 mm. The forms shall be got inspected from 
the Engineer for his approval 12 hours before the construction of the slab and just prior to 
concreting. The form shall be removed when concrete has hardened to the extent to bear the 
weight of cutting machines and crew.
10.3.4	
At all times, sufficient forms/rail shall be used and set to the required alignment for 
at least 150 m length of pavement immediately in advance of the paving operations, or the 
anticipated length of pavement to be laid within the next 24 hrs whichever is more.
10.3.5	
The concrete shall be discharged without segregation into a hopper of the spreader 
which is equipped with means for controlling its rate of deposition on to the sub-base. The 
spreader shall be operated to strike off concrete upto a level requiring a small amount of 
cutting down by the distributor of the spreader. The distributor of spreader shall strike off 
the concrete to the surcharge adequate to ensure that the vibratory compactor thoroughly 
compacts the layer. If necessary, poker vibrators shall be used adjacent to the side forms and 
edges of the previously constructed slab. 
10.3.6	
The vibratory compactor shall be set to strike off the surface slightly high so that 
it is cut down to the required level by the oscillating beam. The machine shall be capable 
of being rapidly adjusted for changes in average and differential surcharge necessitated by 
changes in slab thickness or cross fall. The final finisher shall be able to finish the surface 
to the required level and smoothness as specified, care being taken to avoid bringing up of 
excessive mortar to the surface by over-working.

10.4	
Longitudinal Joint with Shoulder
This is one of the critical areas which is generally not given proper attention. The joint widens 
after the concrete slabs have shrunk and this wide joint allows water to seep to the lower 
layers. Whether the shoulder is rigid or flexible type, the joint should be treated with sealant 
after widening. In case of tied shoulder, the earth near the edge of the shoulder should be 
well compacted so as to minimize the entry of water. It is desirable to provide well compacted 
granular material in a width of 500 mm on edges of tied shoulder.
10.5	
Laying of Concrete over Existing Pavement
When concrete pavement is laid over an existing bituminous pavement which is known 
white-topping, it shall be ensured that the existing road extends over the required width and 
has a minimum thickness of 150 mm and shall be laid as per IRC:SP:76. Where the general 
unevenness/rutting of the surface varies within 25 mm, it can be provided with an overlay 
of Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) with the help of a paver operating with electronic 
sensor to achieve the desired level, grade and alignment. The details are given in IRC:SP:16/ 
IRC:SP:76. The thickness of DBM shall be decided on basis of undulations present on the 
existing road. Alternatively, the existing bituminous pavement can be milled to recycle the 
existing asphalt mix and paved as a sub-base after treating the material with fresh bitumen 
and aggregates as per standard practice.
10.6	
Widening of Existing PQC
Whenever the widening of existing PQC is undertaken by the addition of lanes, the thickness 
of PQC, DLC, and GSB layers should be kept same as that of existing layers in order to drain 
off the water across the pavement surface as well as through GSB drainage layer. 
Tie bars as per the design recommendations for widening PQC shall be installed all along 
the longitudinal joint between existing and widened PQC. Using hydraulic or electrical drilling 
machine with tungsten carbide bit, holes of diameter 2 mm more than the designed diameter 
of tie bars are drilled at mid depth of the existing PQC on its vertical face. The depth of 
the hole shall be half the length of the tie bar. The holes shall be cleaned properly with 
compressed air to remove all dust or dirt from inside the hole. Resin based epoxy shall be 
injected into the full depth of the hole. Afterwards, the tie bar is inserted into the hole till end 
with a revolving motion and held for some time to develop a grip on setting of the epoxy. The 
extra oozed out epoxy from the hole shall be wiped off the surface.
While laying PQC, the levels of the edge of existing PQC shall be followed for matching the 
longitudinal joint between the existing and freshly laid PQC.
All the transverse contraction, construction and expansion joints of the widened PQC with 
dowel bars provided as per the design shall be aligned exactly in line with the joints of 
existing PQC.
The illustrative photographs for PQC widening are given in Appendix A.

10.7.2	
In the curve portion of radius less than 45 m, the spacing between contraction 
joints shall be closer than the normal spacing. The slabs at the critical sections like curve 
portion, underpasses, steep gradient and the slabs having manhole cover with-in itself, slab 
having length/breadth ratio more than 1.5 shall be reinforced with 12 mm dia bars at spacing 
of 150 mm c/c at a depth of 50-75 mm from the top surface.
10.8	
Curing of Concrete
10.8.1	
Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed, the entire surface 
of the newly laid concrete shall be covered against rapid drying, and cured.
Curing can be done by one of the following two methods:
	
(i)	
By application of curing compound followed by spreading of wet hessian and 
moistening it regularly. In case of arid areas where water is extremely scarce, 
two applications of curing compound with moist curing by wet hessian may 
be allowed. Curing compound shall be resin based aluminized reflective 
type.
	
(ii)	
The curing can be done by manual methods using wet hessian which is kept 
moist during curing period in exception for small part of the works. Curing 
shall be done for a minimum period of 14 days. In case of blended cement 
curing shall be done for 16 days.
	
(iii)	 The water used for curing shall also be free from all injurious chemicals, like, 
chlorides and sulphate and shall meet the requirements of IS:456.
10.8.2	
Curing by Application of Curing Compound
Immediately after the surface texturing, the surface and sides of the slab shall be cured 
by the application of approved resin based aluminized reflective curing compound or white 
pigmented curing compound which hardens into an impervious film or membrane with the 
help of a mechanical sprayer.
10.8.2.1	
Curing compounds shall contain sufficient flake aluminum in finely divided 
dispersion to produce a complete coverage of the sprayed surface with a metallic finish. 
The compound shall become stable and impervious to evaporation of water from the surface 
of the concrete within 60 minutes of application. The curing compounds shall have a water 
retention efficiency index not less than 90 per cent in accordance with BS Specification 
No.7542 or as per ASTM C-309-81 Type 2B. 
10.8.2.2	
The curing compound shall not react chemically with the concrete and the film 
or membrane shall not crack, peel or disintegrate within three weeks after application. 
Immediately prior to use, the curing compound shall be thoroughly agitated in its containers. 
The rate of spread shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions checked during 
the construction of the trial length and subsequently whenever required by the Engineer. The 
mechanical sprayer shall incorporate an efficient mechanical device for continuous agitation 



======================================================================

IRC:15-2017
and mixing of the compound during spraying. Arrangements should be made to spray the 
curing compound on the sides of the slab. In addition to spraying of the curing compound, 
the fresh concrete surface shall be protected for at least 3 hours by covering the finished 
concrete pavement with tents supported on mobile truss during adverse weather conditions. 
After two or three hours, the pavement shall be covered including sides by moist hessian 
(minimum of two layers) and the same shall then be kept damp for a minimum period of 
14 days after which time the hessian may be removed. During the curing period, the hessian 
shall be kept continuously moist. All damaged/torn hessian shall be removed and replaced by 
new hessian on a regular basis. To check the rate of spreading of curing compound, a blank 
paper 1 m x 1 m can also be placed on PQC while curing compound is being sprayed, and 
hence the quantity of curing compound may be checked in the field.
10.8.3	
Curing by Manual Methods
After completion of the finishing operations, the surface of the pavement shall be entirely 
covered with wet hessian cloth (minimum of two layers), burlap or jute mats. The coverings 
used shall be of such length (or width) that when laid will extend at least 500 mm beyond 
the edges of the slab, shall be so placed that the entire surface and placed as soon as the 
concrete has set sufficiently to prevent marring of the surface. Prior to their being placed, the 
coverings shall be thoroughly wetted with water and placed with the wettest side down. They 
shall be sufficiently heavy so as to cause them to remain in intimate contact with the surface 
covered. They shall be maintained fully wetted and in position for 24 hours after the concrete 
has been placed, or until the concrete is sufficiently hard to be walked upon without suffering 
any damage. To maintain the coverings wet, water shall be gently spayed so as to avoid 
damage to the fresh concrete. If it becomes necessary to remove the coverings for cutting 
the joints, the concrete slab shall not be kept exposed for a period of more than half an hour. 
The rate of evaporation of water from the PQC shall not be more than 1 kg/sq m/hour to avoid 
plastic or shrinkage cracking.
10.8.3.1	
Worn coverings or coverings with holes shall not be permitted. If the covering is 
furnished in strips, the strip shall be laid to overlap at least 150 mm. 
10.8.3.2	
Covering shall be placed from suitable wooden bridges (IRC:43). Walking on 
freshly laid concrete to facilitate placing coverings or any other use which could be otherwise 
done without using the freshly laid concrete at least upto 28 days will not be permitted to 
maintain the texture depth provided. 
10.9	
Concreting during Monsoon Months
Concreting when it is raining is not recommended. However, under unavoidable situation, 
when concrete is being placed during monsoon months or during the period when it may be 
expected to rain, sufficient supply of tarpaulins or other waterproof cloth shall be provided 
along the line of the work in addition to the portable tents. Any time when it rains, all freshly 
laid concrete which has not been covered for curing purposes shall be adequately protected 



======================================================================

IRC:15-2017
by means of tarpaulins or other waterproof cloth. Any concrete damage by rain shall be 
removed and replaced. Any damage caused to the surface or texture shall be corrected as 
decided by the Engineer. All other precautions recommended before for concreting in hot or 
cold weather shall be adhered to as far as applicable.
10.10	
Work on Gradients
The progress on gradient of all operations of placing, compacting and finishing of concrete 
should proceed from the lower to the higher gradient. The concrete mix shall be stiffer than 
that used on level reaches. In case of very steep gradient, or where filled-up areas/very weak 
subgrade is there, reinforcement in single layer or in two layers in the PQC may be provided. 
Slump of concrete mix in such situations shall be about 20 mm or adjusted from field trials. 
On horizontal curves the separation layer in the form of polythene sheet/geotextile should be 
avoided to prevent the sliding outward of the slabs due to centrifugal force. On such curves, 
DLC should be roughened and cement slurry of proportion 1:1 cement:sand motor should 
be applied over it before placing PQC to create a bond between DLC and PQC. The joints 
in DLC should be co-terminus with those proposed in the PQC. The joints in DLC should be 
sealed with bituminous sealant. 
10.11	
Protection of Concrete
Suitable barricades and sign boards shall be erected and maintained and watchmen employed 
to exclude traffic from the newly constructed pavement for the period wherein prescribed, 
and these barriers shall be so arranged as not in any way to interfere with or impede traffic 
on any lane intended to be kept open and necessary signs and lights shall be maintained 
clearly indicating any lanes open to the traffic. Where, as shown on the plans or indicated in 
the special provision, it is necessary to provide for traffic across the pavement suitable and 
substantial crossings to bridge over the concrete shall have to be provided. Such crossings, 
as constructed, shall be adequate for the traffic and approved by the Engineer. 
10.12	
Any part of the pavement damaged by traffic or other causes occurring prior to its 
final acceptance shall be repaired or replaced in a manner satisfactory to the Engineer. The 
pavement shall be protected against all traffic usage including that of construction vehicles. 
Construction traffic may be allowed after 21 days of paving with written permission of the 
Engineer. However, it is preferable to open after 28 days of curing.
11 TRIAL LENGTH
11.1	
The trial length shall be constructed at least one month in advance of the proposed 
start of concrete paving work. Prior to the construction of the trial length, a detailed method 
statement shall be submitted giving description of the proposed materials, plant, equipments, 
like, paving train, batching plant, tippers, texturing and curing machines etc., proposed in 
the construction and got approved by the Engineer before their procurement. No trials of

IRC:15-2017
new materials, plant equipment or construction methods, or any development of them shall 
be permitted either during the construction of trial length or in any subsequent paving work, 
unless they form part of approved trials. These trial lengths shall be constructed away from 
the carriageway but with at least a sub-base layer stipulated below it. 
11.2	
The trial length of slab shall be at least 60 m for mechanized construction and at 
least 30 m long for semi-mechanized construction.
11.3	
The trial length shall be constructed in two parts over a period comprising at 
least part of two separate working days, with a minimum of 30 m constructed each day 
for mechanized construction and a minimum of 15 m on each day for semi-mechanized 
construction. The trial length shall be constructed at a similar rate to that which is proposed 
for the main work. Minimum of 30 beams for flexural strength 30 cubes if desired by the 
Engineer for the purpose of co-relation shall be cast. At the age of 28 days, 30 cores with 
diameter 150 mm shall be saw cut from the slab. The cores shall be saw cut in both ends to 
provide a specimen height of 300 mm ± 5 mm and shall be tested for compressive strength at 
the age of 28 days. The test results of beam, cube and core shall conform to Clauses 12.8.1, 
12.8.2 and 12.21.
Consolidation of concrete around the dowel should also be checked by taking few random 
cores above the dowel bars. If lack of proper compaction is detected by the honey-combing 
in the cores then the paver setting should be checked and problem be resolved to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer. 
11.4	
Transverse joints and longitudinal joints of each type (i.e contraction, construction, 
expansion) that are proposed for dowel-jointed unreinforced concrete slabs in the main work 
shall be constructed and assessed in the trial length. 
11.5	
Acceptance Criteria of Trial Length and Normal Construction
The trial length shall comply with the Specification in all respects, with the following additions 
and exceptions including strength criteria as per Clauses 12.8.1, 12.8.2 and 12.21. A detailed 
report shall be prepared and got approved by the Engineer. 
11.5.1	
Surface levels and regularity
	
(i)	
In checking for compliance, the levels shall be taken at intervals at the 
locations specified in Clause 12.14 along any line or lines parallel to the 
longitudinal centre line of the trial length.
	
(ii)	
The maximum number of permitted irregularities of pavement surface shall 
comply with the specified requirements. Shorter trial length shall be assessed 
pro-rata based on values for a 300 m length as per IRC:SP:16.

11.5.2	
Alignment of Dowels
(i)	
Alignment of dowel bars shall be inspected at all of the transverse joints in a trial 
length construction by using Magnetic Pulse Induction (MPI) device as per ASTM E3013/
E3013M – 15. The acceptance criteria for dowel placement shall be the following:
•
Horizontal or vertical rotational alignment : ≤ 10 mm over 500 mm
•
Longitudinal side shift
: ≤ 50 mm over 500 mm
•
Depth
: Mid-depth ± 25 mm
Alignment of dowel bars may also be inspected in any two consecutive transverse joints in a 
trial length construction by removing the fresh concrete in a width of 0.5 m on either side of 
the joint. The joint pit shall be refilled with freshly prepared concrete, after inspection.
If the position or alignment of the dowel bars at one of these joints does not comply with 
the requirements and if that joint remains the only one that does not comply after the next 
3 consecutive joints of the same type have been inspected, then the method of placing dowels 
shall be deemed to be satisfactory. In order to check sufficient joints for dowel bar alignment 
without extending the trial length unduly, joints may be constructed at more frequent joint 
intervals than the normal spacing required in trial slabs.
(ii)	
If there are deficiencies in the first expansion joint that is constructed as a trial, 
the next expansion joint shall be a trial joint. Should this also be deficient, further trial of 
expansion joints shall be made as part of the trial length which shall not form part of the 
permanent works.
11.5.3	
Density
Density shall be assessed from at least 3 cores drilled from each part of the trial length. Voids 
in the cores shall not be more than 3 per cent.
11.5.4	
Position of Tie Bars
Compliance for the position and alignment of tie bars shall be checked by using Magnetic 
Pulse Induction (MPI) device as per ASTM E3013/E3013M – 15.
11.5.5	
Position of Dowel Bars 
11.5.5.1	
Compliance for the position and alignment of dowel bars at transverse joints in 
normal construction work shall be checked randomly at 25 per cent of the joints by using 
Magnetic Pulse Induction (MPI) device as per ASTM E3013/E3013M – 15. 
11.5.5.2	
Rejection Criteria
The alignment of dowel bars should be checked using Magnetic Pulse Induction (MPI) device 
as per ASTM E3013/E3013M – 15. The engineer shall check the MPI report of the joints to 
locate the joints of possible failure due to locking of joint in advance and correct them at 



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 96
======================================================================
66
IRC:15-2017
the earliest. If more than half of the dowel bars at a joint do not meet any of the acceptance 
criteria mentioned in Clause 11.5.2, then the joint shall be treated as a locked joint and 
rejected. Such locked joints shall be reconstructed using Full Depth Repair (FDR) method as 
per IRC:SP:83. The joint having any bar misaligned by more than 38 mm shall be rejected.
11.5.5.3	
However, if MPI device is not available then the position and alignment of dowel 
bars and any filler board shall be measured after carefully exposing them in one meter width 
in the plastic concrete across the whole width of the slab. When the joint is an expansion 
joint, the top of the filler board shall first be exposed sufficiently in the plastic concrete to 
permit measurement of any lateral or vertical displacement of the board. During the course of 
normal working, these measurements shall be carried out in the pavement section at the end 
of day’s work by extending slab length by 2 m. After sawing the transverse joint groove, the 
extended 2 m slab shall be removed carefully soon after concrete has set in order to expose 
dowels over half the length. These dowels can be tested for tolerance. 
11.5.5.4	
If the position and alignment of the bars in a single joint in the slab is unsatisfactory 
then the next two joints shall be inspected. If only one joint of the three is defective, the 
rate of checking shall be one joint per day until the Engineer is satisfied that compliance is 
being achieved. In the event of non-compliance in two or more successive joints, fresh trial 
lengths shall be constructed adopting any necessary alteration to concrete mix, paving plant 
or methods until the dowel bars position and alignment are satisfactory.
11.6	
Approval
11.6.1	
Approval of the materials, plant, equipment and construction methods shall be 
given after the trial length complies with these Specifications. Normal working shall not be 
taken up until the trial length has been approved.
11.6.2	
When approval has been given, the materials, plant, equipment and construction 
methods shall not thereafter be changed, except for normal adjustments and maintenance of 
plant, without the approval of the Engineer. Any changes in materials, plant, and equipment 
and construction methods shall require the laying of a further trial length to demonstrate that 
the changes will not adversely affect the permanent works. 
11.6.3	
Trial lengths which do not comply with the requirements, with the exception of 
areas which are deficient only in surface texture and which can be remedied shall be removed 
immediately upon notification of deficiencies by the Engineer and a further trial length shall 
be constructed. 
11.6.4	
Construction of trial sections is considered obligatory on the part of the Contractor 
and the entire cost of construction, dismantling and transportation of debris is to be borne by 
the Contractor.

Repair of Pavement with Exposed Dowels
When the Engineer instructs for the exposure of dowels, such area shall be repaired as 
under: After the dowel bars have been examined, the remainder of the concrete shall be 
removed over a width of 500 mm on each side of the line of the joint and reinstated. If final 
set of concrete has started then with in half hour of exposure, the dowels shall be inserted 
on both sides of the 1 m wide concrete slab by drilling holes and grouting with epoxy mortar. 
Plastic sheaths shall be provided on dowels on one of the joints so that it is made active. The 
joint grooves shall then be widened and sealed. Alternatively, 20 mm holes shall be drilled 
on both faces of the cut to a depth of 250 mm @ 350 mm c/c. The holes shall be air cleaned. 
16 mm dia deformed tie bars shall be inserted with epoxy resins. The dowel bars assembly 
will be reset after rectification if any and the cut shall be concreted. A regular construction 
joint will be cut and sealed as per IRC:57.
11.8	
Final Surface Test
The final surface test shall be made after the curing period and after the removal of the material 
used for curing. The surface shall be of correct alignment, grade and camber specified. 
The surface level, as measured by surface levels taken on a grid points at 5 or 6.25 m 
longitudinally and 3.5 m transversely or any specified grid, shall not have a tolerance greater 
than + 5 mm or – 6 mm. The maximum allowable difference between the road surface and 
the underside of a 3 m straight edge placed parallel with or at right angles to the centre line 
of the road shall be 3 mm for pavement constructed with mechanized method and 6 mm for 
semi-mechanised construction or fixed form construction. Any spots higher than the correct 
surface as prescribed above, shall be ground down with an approved scabbler/grinding tool 
to the required level and textured by by cutting grooves on the surface.
12 QUALITY CONTROL
12.1	
Sampling and Testing
Samples from fresh concrete shall be taken as per IS:1199 and cube and beam specimens 
shall be made, cured and tested at 28 days as per IS:516.
12.2	
The minimum frequency of sampling of concrete shall be one sample per 
150 m3 (or part thereof) of concrete. Each sample shall comprise of 3 test specimens of 
beams. These shall be tested for 28 days strength. Engineer may also get cube specimens 
cast at the rate of 3 such specimens per sample, as in case of beam for each 150 m3 (or 
part thereof) of concrete for his reference, record and possible use for co-relation purposes. 
However, test pertaining to beams shall govern. For each day’s work, number of specimens 
shall not be less than six beams, taken out of 2 different batches of concrete. Additional six 
cubes may also be got cast for reference, record and co-relation, if desired by the Engineer.

IRC:15-2017
12.3	
The test results of the sample shall be the average of the strength of three 
specimens, comprising the sample. The individual variations of any specimen (beam/cube/
core) shall not be more than ± 15 per cent of the average (of the three specimen comprising 
the sample).
12.4	
Flexural strength shall be used for quality control and for acceptance purposes. 
The flexural strength should be determined by modulus of rupture under third point loading 
as per IS:516. The preferred size of beam shall be 150 mm x 150 mm x 700 mm for the 
maximum size of aggregate of 31.5 mm. 
12.5	
It may, however, be ensured that the materials and mix proportions remain 
substantially unaltered during the daily concrete production. The water content shall be the 
minimum required to provide the agreed workability for full compaction of the concrete to the 
required density as determined by the trial mixes and the maximum free water cement or 
water cementitious material ratio shall be 0.40. 
12.6	
The ratio between the 7 and 28 day strength (R) shall be established for the mix 
to be used in the slab. This will be done at the time of initial design of mix. For this purpose, 
at least 6 specimen of beams shall be cast from each batch of concrete produced in the 
laboratory. Minimum 6 batches ensuring minimum 36 specimens of beams shall thus be cast 
cured and tested in the presence of Engineer. Out of the 6 specimens drawn from each batch, 
one specimen from each batch shall be cured and tested for 7 days strength and balance 
5 specimen of each batch shall be cured and tested for 28 days strength. This will provide at 
least 30 specimens required to determine actual standard deviation of 28 days strength. The 
specimen of cubes may also be got cast as per procedure above if so desired for reference, 
record and co-relation. The value of ‘R’ shall be arrived by dividing the average strength of 
the 7 day specimens by the average strength of the 28 day specimens. The ratio ‘R’ shall be 
expressed upto three places of decimal. In case of urgency, accelerated curing methods may 
be adopted after approval of the Engineer-in-Charge.
12.7	
If during the construction of the trial length or during some normal working, the 
average value of any four consecutive 7 day test results falls below the required 7 day 
strength as derived from the value of ‘R’ then the cement content of the concrete shall, 
without any extra payment, be increased by 5 per cent by weight. Whenever the cement 
content is increased, the concrete mix shall be adjusted to maintain the required workability. 
Cement shall be increased by 5 per cent in case of manual construction or construction in 
marshy/waterlogged areas.
12.8	
 Acceptance Criteria of Strength
12.8.1	
Flexural Strength
The concrete will be said to comply with the specified flexural strength, when the following 
conditions are met with.



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 96
======================================================================

IRC:15-2017
	
i)	
The mean strength determined from any group of 4 consecutive samples 
(each sample containing 3 beam specimen i.e. 4 x 3 = 12 beam specimens) 
at 28 days should exceed the specified characteristic flexural strength by at 
least 0.3 MPa.
	
ii)	
The strength of any sample is not less than the specified characteristic 
flexural strength minus 0.1 MPa.
12.8.2	
Compressive Strength*
When both the following conditions are met, the concrete complies with the specified 
compressive strength;
	
i)	
The mean strength determined from any group of 4 consecutive samples 
(4 x 3 = 12 cubes specimens) at 28 days should exceed the specified 
characteristic compressive strength by 3 MPa.
	
ii)	
The strength of any sample is not less than the specified characteristic 
compressive strength minus 1 MPa.
*   Applicable for smaller projects, where design is based on compressive strength. In case of 
requirement, Falling Weight Deflectometer may be used for evaluation of load transfer capacity or 
for other parameters.
12.9	
Desirable Properties of Pavement Concrete
For road work, the concrete should have sufficient workability to permit thorough compaction, 
and adequate compressive and flexural strength. It should also be dense, resistant to weather, 
capable of resisting the abrasive and impact action of traffic, finished with an even surface to 
give a good riding quality and provided with a surface, such as, to maintain a high resistance 
to skidding throughout its life. The mix shall be compatible with the method of construction, 
equipments used and its design.
12.10	
Workability
The workability of the mix should be just sufficient to enable the concrete to be compacted fully 
by whatever method is employed. It should not be higher than necessary for this purpose, as 
this will lead to segregation, surface laitance, and difficulty in maintaining the concrete to its 
true profile on gradients and cross-falls, and a reduction in strength due to excessive water 
content. For fully mechanized construction the slump shall be 20 to 30 mm and 40 to 60 mm 
for semi mechanized and fixed form construction. On rising gradient slump should be around 
20 mm.
12.11	
Degree of Compaction
12.11.1	
Particular attention should be paid in constructing concrete roads to the methods 
of compacting concrete. It is of the utmost importance from strength consideration that 
maximum compaction should be achieved without segregation and bleeding a. When high

IRC:15-2017
efficiency vibrating or other machines are used to compact the concrete from the top surface 
only, very little trouble would normally be experienced with concrete layers upto 350 mm thick, 
provided the concrete has adequate and uniform workability. With commercially available 
screed vibrators of low amplitudes, this thickness is of the order of 125 mm. Inadequate 
vibration or the compacting effort induces excess voids. The presence of 5 per cent air voids 
in the concrete will reduce the strength from that of fully compacted concrete by about 30 per 
cent and the presence of 10 per cent voids will reduce the strength by 60 per cent. These 
voids are different from those produced by admixtures/air entraining agents. The Engineer-
in-Charge should, therefore, ensure that the concrete gets properly compacted throughout 
the depth. Careful observation of the side surface of concrete after the removal of form work 
will help in identifying the honey-combed area to some extent. In case of doubt, breaking of a 
trial slab or drilling cores may be resorted to for confirming the efficacy of the vibrating effort.
12.11.2	
The sides of the PQC which are honey combed/hungry surfaces shall be finished 
with 1:4 cement and mortar at w/c ratio 0.4. 
12.11.3	
Voids in Concrete 
The voids in the concrete shall not be more than 3 per cent by volume of compacted concrete 
in any case. 
12.11.4	
The concrete represented by a core shall be considered acceptable if the average 
equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 per cent of the characteristic 
compressive strength of the grade of concrete specified for the corresponding age as 
mentioned in IS:456. However, the individual core shall not have strength less than 
75 per cent of the characteristic strength of concrete. Age factors shall not to be applied on 
cores while determining the strength.
12.12	
Durability
Where soils are impregnated with deleterious salts in injurious amount, protection of concrete 
from direct contact with such soils may be achieved by providing a suitable capillary cut-off. 
Where sulphate attack is probable, depending on the degree of severity, sulphate resistant-
cements or Portland blast furnace slag cements or Portland pozzolana cements or cements 
with pozzolonic admixtures, such as, burnt clay pozzlana or fly ash may be used. In all cases, 
concrete shall be well compacted, strong and dense. Pozzolanic admixtures like fly ash (upto 
25 per cent) and GGBFS (up to 50 per cent) of cementitious material, Portland pozzolana 
cement or Portland slag cement may also be found useful in areas where alkali-reactive 
aggregates cannot be precluded from use in concrete road construction. 
12.13	
Resistance to Abrasion
The resistance of concrete to abrasion is normally very high when good quality hard aggregates 
are used. The use of rounded aggregates, which wear away at the same rate as the cement 
matrix in the top course, may in time tend to polish and produce a slippery surface. Besides, 



======================================================================

71

IRC:15-2017
when the road is to be used by steel tyred or tracked vehicles, such as, iron-tyred bullock 
carts, tanks, etc., the use of certain types of aggregates, use of silica fume as per IRC:114, 
and steel fibres as per IRC:SP:46 may reduce rapid abrasion. It has been established that 
with good quality concrete of compressive strength of the order of 40 MPa (corresponding 
flexural strength of the order of 4.5 MPa or greater as per IRC:44, good resistance to abrasion 
can be secured. Results would not be satisfactory when comparatively brittle materials, such 
as, flint are used.
12.14	
Riding Quality
12.14.1	
Producing regular surface of concrete for requisite riding quality is very closely 
connected with careful spreading, accurate setting and bedding of the side forms, and 
standard of workmanship in constructing joints and in finishing as well. The cement concrete 
mix should be of uniform consistency and such that when screeded it holds up to cross-falls 
and gradients without deformation, and yet is sufficiently workable at the edges of the slabs. 
12.14.2	
The uniform spreading of the concrete with requisite surcharge that will ensure 
maximum density after compaction will minimize surface irregularities. 
12.14.3	
The surface should be checked regularly with a straight edge 3.0 m long after 6 to 
12 hours of laying. Use of moving straight edge for checking surface regularity is recommended.
12.14.4	
Great care should be taken in constructing joints so that the edges of concrete on 
the two sides of a joint are at the same level.
12.14.5	
It is only by careful attention to the type of surface finish from the commencement 
of construction that good riding quality can be obtained.
12.14.6	
All works performed shall conform to the lines, grades, cross sections and 
dimensions shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer, subject to the permitted 
tolerances described herein-after.
12.15	
Horizontal Alignment
The horizontal alignment shall be checked with respect to the centre line of the carriageway 
as shown in the drawings. The edges of the carriageway as constructed shall be corrected 
within a tolerance of ± 10 mm there from.
12.16	
Surface Levels
The levels of the subgrade and different pavement courses as constructed shall not vary 
from those calculated with reference to the longitudinal and cross profile of the road shown 
on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer beyond the tolerances mentioned in Table 10.

Surface Texture
It is not possible at present to define the surface texture of a concrete road in terms of its 
durability and resistance to skidding. It is, however, known that the concrete should not be 
worked to such a degree during compaction that laitance roll appears on the surface, and 
that with well-proportioned concrete; a satisfactory surface can be produced by standard 
methods of compaction. To remove the laitance roll, either a hollow light weight tube or long 
jute sheet (having high water absorption) fitted with TCM (Texturing and Curing Machine) is 
used. In case of tines, texture depth shall be measured with depth measuring gauge/device. 
12.19	
Effect of Chemical Admixtures on the Properties 
12.19.1	
An admixture is a material added in very small quantities to a concrete mix to 
improve some of its desirable properties. The types of admixtures considered here are air-
entraining agents, accelerators, retarders, plasticizers and superplasticizers. 
12.19.2	
Air Entraining Agent
The use of admixtures to entrain air in concrete is permitted. The air is entrained in the form 
of numberless discrete and microscopic bubbles evenly distributed through the mass. Such 
concrete is better resistant to the frost, less liable to segregation and bleeding and more 
workable than concrete with no air-entrainment. The strength can be restored to the original 
value by small adjustments in the mix proportions. Because of increased workability due to 
incorporation of air-entraining agent, the water-cement ratio can be lowered so that the loss 
of strength due to air-entraining is compensated. Whilst air-entrainment is not necessary in 
most parts of India to increase the frost resistance of concrete in road slabs, as elsewhere. 
It may have advantages, by virtue of the greater cohesion and workability it develops, in 
facilitating the production of a good riding surface and in reducing flow on gradients and 
cross-falls.

======================================================================
74
IRC:15-2017
12.19.3	
Accelerators
These are used to accelerate the setting and hardening of cement concrete for (i) effecting 
economy in curing and formwork by speeding up the progress of the concrete works, (ii) 
concreting in cold weather, the rate of hardening being slow at very low temperatures and (iii) 
emergency repairs by producing a flash set, sometimes even in minutes. The most common 
accelerator that has been successfully used is calcium chloride, which increases the rate 
of heat evolution; this is very beneficial in cold weather (sub-zero temperatures). However, 
when used in hot weather, the initial stiffening can be too rapid. The quantity of calcium 
chloride to be used should ordinarily not exceed 2 per cent by weight of cement used. It is 
important to see that calcium chloride should be thoroughly dissolved in the mixing water, 
and that the solution is evenly distributed throughout the batch. The use of calcium chloride is 
not permitted when reinforcement is provided, due to the possibility of corrosion. When CaCl2 
is used, tie and dowel bars shall be coated with appropriate anticorrosive coatings. 
12.19.4	
Retarder
Retarders have an opposite effect to that of accelerators, retarders are used to delay the 
setting and hardening of concrete. They are used mainly for (i) concreting in hot weather, 
where the setting time may get reduced (due to high temperature) to the extent that it may 
not be possible to complete compaction and finishing operations before the concrete begins 
to set, (ii) ready mixed concrete which is to be transported, where the time for transportation 
to the site, laying, compaction and finishing has to be extended, before the concrete begins 
to set. Some retarders tend to reduce the rate of development of strength and also reduce 
the ultimate strength. Experiments have shown that sugar, when used upto a maximum of 
0.05 per cent by weight of cement, can be very effective in retarding the setting time of 
concrete. It may, however, be noted that quantities of sugar in excess of 0.05 per cent by 
weight of cement may prove to be harmful.
12.19.5	
Superlasticizers/Poly Carboxylate Ether (PCE) High Range Water Reducing 
Admixture (HRWRA)
These are used as water-reducing agents, so that for a given workability, the water-cement 
ratio can be reduced to achieve a higher strength as compared to mix without the additive. 
The components of water-reducing admixtures are surface-active agents, which alter the 
physico-chemical forces at the interface between two phases. The agents are adsorbed 
on the surface of the cement particles, which gives them a negative charge, which cause 
mutual repulsion, leading to their dispersal. Even air bubbles are repelled and cannot attach 
themselves to the cement particles. The negative charge causes a sheath of oriented water 
molecules around each particle which separates them. The water, free from the flocculated 
system, is thus available to lubricate the mix, thereby increasing its workability. The decrease 
in mixing water varies between 20 and 25 per cent in case of superlicizers and up to 
40 per cent in case of PCE based HRWRA, and depends on the cement content, aggregate 
type, presence of pozzolana or admixture etc. Trial mixes should be made to ensure desired 
workability at paving site. The water/cement ratio shall however, not be less than 0.25. The 
Admixture used shall conform to Table 12.

Joints and Testing of Applied Sealants
12.20.1	
Arrangement of Joints 
(a)	
Staggered Joints
It has been observed that where transverse joints have been staggered on either side of 
longitudinal joint, sympathetic cracking has often occurred in line with the joint in the adjacent 
slab; therefore it is desirable that joints be constructed in line across the full width of the 
pavement.
(b)	
Skew Joints
The use of skew joints increases the risk of cracking at the acute angled corner and may also 
tend to make the slab move sideways. Thus transverse joints should as far as possible, be 
at right angle to the edges to the pavements.
(c)	
Acute-angled Corner
The acute–angled corners should be avoided in the layout of the road and airfield slabs 
as the stresses due to loading become exceedingly high. Under the conditions of corners 
warping upward so that they are completely unsupported, the stresses at the corners of 
various angles calculated theoretically and expressed in terms of stress at a right-angled 
corner, are approximately be 100 per cent, 145 per cent and 210 per cent for 90o, 70o and 
50o respectively.
12.20.2	
If acute angled corners are unavoidable, as sometimes is the case at intersections, 
the corners should be strengthened either by increasing the slab thickness at this point, or by 
heavy reinforcement or by both.
12.20.3	
The shape and dimensions of the slabs, in transitioning from one width to another 
or where changes in direction are necessary, should be such as easily negotiated by traffic, 
pleasing to the eyes and also permit the satisfactory compaction and finishing of the top 
surface.

PAGE 84 of 96

76
IRC:15-2017
12.20.4	
Spacing of Joints 
The spacing of transverse joints depends on several factors, the more important of which 
are the coefficient of thermal expansion of the concrete, the temperature during placing, the 
frictional restraint of the DLC sub-base to the movement of the slab, the thickness of the slab 
and the amount of reinforcement. For unreinforced concrete pavement, the spacing of joints 
shall be such as to obviate the formation of uncontrolled cracks which would open and give 
rise to spalling. For reinforced concrete slab, the spacing of joints should be related to the 
weight of reinforcement so that opening of hair cracks is effectively controlled.
12.20.5	
Sealant
The sealant should not be more than six months old and a certificate to this effect stating that 
the sealant complies with the relevant standards should be obtained before approval for use.

12.20.5.2	 Field Adhesion Test for Silicon Sealant
As a check for adhesion, a simple hand pull test may be performed on the job site after the 
sealant is fully cured (usually within 14 to 21 days). The hand pull procedure is as follows:
	
i)	
Make a knife cut perpendicular to the joint from one side of the joint to the other.

iv)

and pull at a 90° angle. Hold a ruler along side the sealant.
	
v)	
If the 25 mm mark on the sealant can be pulled to the 140 mm mark on 
the ruler, i.e. 450 per cent elongation, without any failure of the sealant, the 
sealant should perform in a joint designed for +100/-50 per cent movement.
12.20.5.3	 Tests on Poly-Sulphide Sealant 
For poly-sulphide sealant testing and specification IS:11433 may be referred. In brief, testing

Quality Control Chart
A quality control chart indicating the strength values of individual specimens shall be 
maintained for continuous quality assurance. Where the requirements are not met with, or 
where the quality of the concrete or its compaction is suspect, the actual strength of the 
concrete in the slab shall be ascertained by carrying out tests on cores cut at the rate of 
2 cores for every 150 cu m. of concrete. The average of the results of crushing strength 
tests on these cores shall not be less than 0.8 x 0.85 times the corresponding characteristic 
compressive strength of cubes, where the height to diameter ratio of the cores is two. Where 
height to diameter ratio is not two, necessary corrections shall be made in calculating the 
crushing strength of cubes in the following manner.
12.21.1	
The crushing strengths of cylinders with height to diameter ratios between 1 and 
2 may be corrected to correspond to a standard cylinder of height to diameter ratio of 2 by 
multiplying with the correction factor obtained from the following equation:
	
f = 0.11 n + 0.78
	
where	
f = correction factor and
	
	
	
n = height to diameter ratio

IRC:15-2017
12.21.2	
The corrected test results shall be analyzed for conformity with the specification 
requirements for cube samples. Where the core tests are satisfactory, they shall have 
precedence for assessing concrete quality over the results of moulded specimens. The 
diameter of cores shall not be less than 150 mm. 
12.21.3	
If, however, the tests on cores also confirm that the concrete is not satisfying the 
strength requirements, then the concrete corresponding to the area from which the cores 
were cut should be replaced, i.e., at least over an area extending between two transverse 
joints where the defects could be isolated or over larger area, if necessary, as assessed by 
additional cores and their test results.
If approved by Engineer, FWD tests may be performed for assessment of the pavement. 
12.21.4	
The standard deviation shall be calculated from the test results obtained after any 
change in the source of quality of materials and the mix shall be adjusted as necessary to 
comply with the requirements.
12.21.5	
Beams shall be made each day in pairs at intervals, each pair being from a different 
batch of concrete. At the start of the work, and until such time as the Engineer may order a 
reduction in the number of beams required, at least six pairs of beams and cubes shall be 
made each day, one of each pair for testing at 28 days for determination of the minimum 
permissible flexural strength and the other for testing at 7 days for the Engineer to assess 
the quality of the mix. When the first thirty number of 28 days results are available, and for 
so long as the Engineer is satisfied with the quality of the mix, he may reduce the number of 
beams and cubes required.
12.21.6	
During the course of construction, when the source of any material is to be 
changed, or if there is any variation in the quality of the materials furnished, additional tests and 
necessary adjustments in the mix shall be made as required to obtain the specified strength.
12.21.7	
The flexural strengths obtained on beams tested before 28 days shall be used in 
conjunction with a correlation between them and the 28 days flexural strengths to detect any 
deterioration in the quality of the concrete being produced. Any such deterioration shall be 
remedied without awaiting the 28 days strengths but the earlier strengths shall not constitute 
sole evidence of non-compliance of the concrete from which they were taken.
12.21.8	
Should the concrete fail to pass the specification for strength as described above, 
the Contractor may, at his own expense, elect to cut cores from the suspect concrete as per 
direction of the Engineer. From the relation between cube strength and flexural strength, the 
core strength shall be converted to flexural strength.
12.21.9	
Any concrete that fails to meet the strength requirement shall be removed and 
replaced at Contractor’s expense.

IRC:15-2017
12.22	
In-situ density
The density of the compacted concrete shall be such that the total air voids are not more 
than 3 per cent. The air voids shall be derived from the difference between the theoretical 
maximum dry density of the concrete calculated from the specific gravities of the constituents 
of the concrete mix and the average value of three direct density measurements made on 
cores at least of 150 mm diameter. Three cores shall be taken from trial lengths and in first 
two km length of the pavement, while the slab is being constructed. 
12.23	
All cores taken for density measurement in the trial section shall also be checked 
for thickness. The same cores shall be made use for determining in-situ strength. In case of 
doubt, additional cores may be ordered by the Engineer and taken at locations decided by 
him to check the density and strength of concrete slab. 
12.24	
In calculating the density, allowance shall be made for any steel in cores.
12.25	
Cores removed from the main carriageway shall be reinstated with compacted 
concrete mix (of same design mix) used for pavement works. Before filling the fine mix, 
the sides shall be hacked and cleaned with water. Thereafter, cement-sand slurry shall be 
applied to the sides just prior to filling the concrete mix. 
12.26	
Pavement Thickness
All precautions and care shall be to taken to construct pavement having uniform thickness as 
called for on the plan. 
12.27	
Thickness of the cement concrete pavement shall be calculated on the basis of 
level data of the cement concrete pavement and the underlying sub-base taken on a grid of 
5 m x 3.5 m or 6.25 m x 3.5 m, the former measurement being in longitudinal direction or any 
other grid recommended by the Engineer.
12.28	
A day’s work is considered as a ‘lot’ for calculating the average thickness of the 
slab. In calculating the average thickness, individual measurements which are in excess of 
the specified thickness shall be considered as the specified thickness. No extra payment for 
the same shall be made.
12.29	
Individual areas deficient by more than 20 mm shall be verified by the Engineer by 
ordering core cutting and if in his opinion the deficient areas warrant removal, they shall be 
removed and replaced with concrete of the thickness shown on the plans.
12.30	
When the average thickness for the lot is deficient by the extent shown in 
Table 13, the Contract until price will be adjusted as per this Table 13 and payment can be 
made for reduced thickness.

In the stretch where deficiency of average thickness is more than 20 mm, cores 
shall be cut to ascertain the deficiency as directed by the Engineer, section whose thickness 
is deficient by 20 mm or more is identified with the help of cores. Such slabs shall be removed 
and reconstructed at the cost of the Contractor. During such rectification work, care shall be 
taken to replace full slab and to the full depth.
12.32	
Acceptance criteria for cracked concrete slabs
Concrete slabs may develop cracks of minor to serious nature unless appropriate precautions 
are taken to prevent their occurrence either during the construction phase or post-construction 
period. Cracks can appear generally due to the following reasons:
	
(a)	
Drying shrinkage 
	
(b)	
Plastic shrinkage of concrete surface due to rapid loss of moisture
	
(c)	
High wind velocity associated with low humidity
	
(d)	
High ambient temperature
	
(e)	
Delayed sawing of joints
	
(f)	
Rough and uneven surface of the base on which concrete slabs are 
constructed
	
(g)	
Combination of the above factors.
12.33	
The slabs with full depth cracks are totally unacceptable as it amounts to structural 
failure. Besides, other cracks which are deep and are likely to progress in depth with time 
are also to be considered as serious in nature. Fine crazy cracks however, are not serious. 
Acceptance criteria for cracked concrete slabs shall be as follows:
	
(i)	
Plastic shrinkage cracks with cumulative length of 3000 mm in a slab can 
be accepted after repair as per IRC:SP:83. Beyond cumulative length of 
3000 mm shall be rejected.
	
(ii)	
Slabs with cracks running transversely or longitudinally penetrating to full 
depth and length of the slab are to be rejected.
	
(iii)	 Slabs with any type of cracks which are penetrating to more than half the 
depth shall be rejected.
