CHAPTER - 1 
INTRODUCTION
Geosynthetic is defined as a planar product manufactured from a polymeric material which are 
used with soil, rock, or other geotechnical-related material as an integral part of a road project, to 
improve its performance. Synthetic materials in the form of strong flexible sheets either woven or 
nonwoven, permeable or water tight, 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional have been used for several 
years to improve soil quality and performance in different pavement related facets of geotechnical 
engineering, e.g. base and sub base stabilization, reinforcement, drainage, protection of slopes 
and embankments. Specific products such as, geotextiles, geogrids, geocell, geomembranes, 
geocomposite etc., have been progressively developed for various applications. A common 
generic name ‘Geosynthetics’ is being used to refer the different materials mentioned above.
Several detrimental factors affect the service life of roads and pavements including environmental 
factors, subgrade conditions, traffic loading, utility cuts, and ageing. Pavement distresses such 
as surface cracks, joints, and subgrade failures cause the rapid reflection/propagation of cracks 
up through the pavement layers and increase the maintenance cost. Therefore, the preferred 
strategy for long term road and pavement performance is to build in safeguards during initial 
construction. These performance safeguards include stabilizing the subgrade against moisture 
intrusion and associated weakening, strengthening the road base and sub-base by allowing the 
efficient drainage of infiltrated water, and enhancing the stress absorption and moisture proofing 
capabilities.
1.1	
Scope
This publication contains information on Geosynthetics made from polymeric materials and their 
use in road pavements and other associated works. This document provides detailed design 
methodology, specifications, construction guidelines, standard test methods, handling and 
storage of all the geosynthetics for road pavement applications. The applications addressed in 
the document include:
•	
Stabilization and reinforcing of pavement layers
•	
Separation and filtration
•	
Subsurface and surface drainage
•	
Erosion control of road embankments

The document however excludes other possible applications of geosynthetics such as reinforced 
soil walls & slopes, containment of landslides and geosynthetics made from natural fibres.
These guidelines may require revision from time-to-time based on future developments and 
experience in the field. Towards this end, it is suggested to all the organizations using the 
guidelines to keep a detailed record of the year of construction, subgrade CBR, soil characteristics 
including resilient modulus, pavement composition and specifications, reinforcement details, 
traffic, pavement performance, type and thickness of overlay performance, climatic condition, 
periodical measurements (both before and after strengthening) etc. and provide feedback to the 
Indian Roads Congress for further revision.
Chapters in this publication are organized in a way that followed sequence gives a better 
understanding of the objective of the publication.
Chapter-1 “Introduction” provides details of different geosynthetic materials, their composition, 
functions and applications in road pavement works.
Chapter-2 “Properties and Test methods” addresses all the required tests to be performed to 
evaluate the Geosynthetic function and applications. It gives detailed testing procedures and the 
properties required as per the available ISO, IRC, BIS, ASTM and BS.
Chapter-3 “Design methodology” explains the mechanism, design methodology using different 
geosynthetic materials and analysis for different applications.
Chapter-4 “Geosynthetic Selection Criteria” provides guidance and helps design engineers 
and specification writers with the selection of geosynthetics based on the required function, 
application, site conditions, and other economical technical feasibilities.
Chapter-5 “Construction guidelines” brings out the installation aspects and methodologies to be 
practiced while executing and installing geosynthetics.
Chapter-6 “Handling, storage and Installation” gives information on safe handling and 
transportation of geosynthetics without any damage before installation.
This document also includes the solved numerical example in Annexure IV for easy understanding 
of the design methodologies explained in Chapter-3.
1.2 
Raw Materials and Classification of Geosynthetics
1.2.1	
Raw materials
Polymers are the major raw materials for manufacturing geosynthetics. The polymers used are 
polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene, polyamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride. Some types 
of geosynthetics are made from carbon fibre, glass fibre and natural fibres also.
1.2.2	
Classification of geosynthetics
Geosynthetics can be classified in many ways based on manufacturing process, materials used 
or function. General classification of geosynthetics for the applications in pavements is given

IRC:SP:59-2019

in Fig. 1.1. The classification is based on the spatial aspects of the geosynthetic material. For 
example, one dimensional material will have only one spatial character as length compared 
to other dimensions (ropes, straps and cables). Two dimensional materials will have only two 
spatial characteristics either length or width or height (Geogrids, Geotextiles, Geocomposites and 
Geomembranes), whereas three dimensional materials will possess the spatial characteristics 
in all three dimensions i.e. length, width and height (geocell, geomats, geonets, geospacers and 
three dimensional geogrids).
Fig. 1.1 Classification of Geosynthetics
1.2.3	
Types of geosynthetics for pavement applications
1.2.3.1	
Geotextile: Geotextiles can be defined as any permeable synthetic textile used with 
foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material as an integral 
part of an infrastructure project, structure, or system. The geotextiles are generally classified by 
the manufacturing process and are often separated into two sub-categories, namely, woven 
and non-woven. Another type of geotextile includes (i) Knitted geotextiles and (ii) Composite 
geotextiles (Fig. 1.2).
Woven geotextiles are manufactured by weaving weft threads through warp threads. Strength of 
geotextile in machine direction is usually larger than cross machine direction.
Non-woven geotextiles are produced from randomly distributed continuous filaments or staple 
fibres, which are bonded together chemically, thermally or mechanically.
Knitted geotextiles consists of a single strand systematically intertwined with itself and is 
manufactured with a knitting machine, instead of a weaving loom.
Composite geotextiles (Multi-layered geotextiles) are manufactured by combining layers of 
different types of geotextiles. The components can be combined by needling, stitching, chemical 
bonding or heat bonding. (IRC HRB Special Report No. 12, ‘State-of-the-Art: Application of 
Geotextiles in Highway Engineering’).

1.2.3.2	
Geogrid: Geogrids are polymers formed into a very open, grid like configuration, 
i.e., they have apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. 
Geogrids are mainly made from polymeric materials, typically polypropylene (PP), high 
density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyester (PET). Geogrids can be classified according to (a) 
manufacturing process(woven, knitted, bonded, welded, extruded), (b) directional behaviour 
(uniaxial, biaxial, etc.), (c) bonding between ribs and (d) Polymer (polypropylene, polyester, 
PVC etc). Biaxial geogrids have significant strength in both the machine and cross machine 
directions.
Fig. 1.3 Geogrids
1.2.3.3	
Geomembranes: Geomembrane is a very low permeability/impervious synthetic 
membrane liner or barrier used to control fluid migration across the plane. These are made from 
relatively thin continuous polymeric sheets, but they can also be made from the impregnation of 
geotextiles with bitumen, polymer sprays or as multilayered bitumen geocomposites. Continuous 
polymer sheet geomembranes are by far the most common.

1.2.3.4	
Geonets: Geosynthetic material consisting of integrally connected parallel sets of ribs 
overlying similar sets at various angles formed by a continuous extrusion into a net like configuration 
for in plane drainage of liquids. Geonets are often laminated with geotextiles on one or both 
surfaces and are referred to as drainage composites. There are three categories of geonets.
•	
Bi-planar geonets: These are the original and most common types and consist of two 
sets of intersecting ribs at different angles and spacing’s. The ribs themselves are of 
different sizes and shapes for different styles.
•	
Tri-planar geonets: These have parallel central ribs with smaller sets of ribs above 
and beneath mainly for geometric stability.
•	
Other geonets: These newer geonet structures have either box shaped channels or 
protruding columns from an underlying support network.
Fig. 1.5 Geonet
1.2.3.5	
Geospacer: Geospacer is a three-dimensional geosynthetic extruded from polymeric 
materials such as HDPE. It provides separation and a void between layers to provide in-
plane drainage. Typical geospacers are formed in continuous sheets which can be used as an 
impermeable layer or perforated to allow water migration. The material is UV stabilised with

carbon black. Geospacer are often laminated with geotextiles on one or both sides and are 
referred to as drainage geocomposites increasingly being used to replace traditional gravel 
drainage layers.
Fig. 1.6 Geospacers
1.2.3.6	
Geocell: Geocells (also known as Cellular Confinement Systems) are three-
dimensional honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when in-filled 
with compacted soil or aggregate. Extruded from polymeric materials such as HDPE, into strips 
welded together ultrasonically in series or in continuous process capable to create the cells 
without any subsequent welding, the geocell structures, the strips are expanded to form the stiff 
(and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. The material is UV 
stabilised with carbon black.

1.3 
Functions of Geosynthetics
In a given application, a geosynthetic can perform one or several functions to improve the 
mechanical and/or hydraulic behaviour of the structure in which it is incorporated. The basic 
functions performed by a geosynthetic are as follows:
	
1.	
Separation/Filtration
	
2.	
Reinforcement
	
3.	
Drainage
	
4.	
Moisture Barrier
	
5.	
Erosion Control
Each of these functions can be defined in terms of the role they fulfil in the installation. Definitions 
and description of each of these functions are explained below.
Properties, testing methods and the selection guidelines for each geosynthetic material for 
various functions listed above are given in Chapters 2 and 4 respectively.
1.4	
Separation/Filtration
The separation function refers prevention of intermixing of the two layers of dissimilar materials 
throughout the design life of the material. Normally, geotextiles provide for separation between 
layers in pavement. It prevents intrusion/pumping of soil particles into the base/sub-base course. 
Simultaneously, it performs the function of filtration by dissipating the pore water pressure and 
allowing the passage of fluids into or across the plane of the geotextiles while preventing the 
uncontrolled passage of soil particles.
1.5 
Reinforcement
Reinforcement function of geosynthetics is defined as use of the stress-strain behaviour of a 
geosynthetic material to improve the mechanical properties of soil or other construction materials. 
Different types of geogrids and woven geotextiles have high tensile strength can be used as 
reinforcing materials in pavements. The combined use of soil (good in compression and poor in 
tension) and geotextiles/geogrids (good in tension and poor in compression) suggests a number 
of situations in which they have made existing design work better or developed entirely new

11
applications. In base reinforcement applications, geogrids are placed within or at the bottom 
of unbound layers of a flexible pavement system and improve the load-carrying capacity of the 
pavement under repeated traffic.
Asphalt reinforcement reduces the reflective cracking and improves moisture retention by 
impregnating with bitumen in tack coat. In general paving fabric, paving grids and Asphalt 
Interlayer Composite (AIC) or composite paving grids are used for asphalt reinforcement in 
pavements.
With moisture barrier function of paving fabric, it will not allow moisture to reach granular layers 
and which also prevents propagation of crack and also acts as (Stress Absorbing Membrane 
Interlayer) SAMI layer.
Paving grids are with square apertures and laid with minimum cover of bituminous layers. Paving 
Grid strengths are decided, considering the stresses to be absorbed. 
Considering above two generic products, for combined benefit of moisture barrier and stress 
absorbing functions, composites are needed. A Grid combined with a Paving Fabric it is called 
a Composite (Geocomposite). Composites provide the membrane and also high strength 
reinforcement. Asphalt Interlayer composite is made from Nonwoven Geotextile knitted with 
Fibre Glass yarn, will provide dual functions. Composites are stiffer materials with less or minimal 
elongation and require slower installation speeds.

Drainage
Drainage is collecting and transporting of precipitation, ground water, and/or other fluids in 
the plane of a geosynthetic material. A suitable permeable geosynthetic material provides 
a filtration function which serves the same role in soil structures as the various gradation of 
granular material.
1.7	
Moisture Barrier
The barrier function refers to the prevention or limits the migration of fluid across the plane of 
the geosynthetic material. This geosynthetic function has wide application in asphalt pavement 
overlays and encapsulation of swelling soils. A nonwoven geotextile provides a barrier function 
when saturated with an impermeable material like, bitumen. In this application, the geotextile is 
saturated with a bitumen-based material (tack coat) and the new overlay is placed directly onto

the geotextile. The geotextile-tack coat combination prevents the movement of water from the 
surface of the overlay into the pavement layers and vice-versa. 
1.8	
Erosion Control
Use of a geosynthetic material is to prevent or limit soil or other particle movements at the 
surface of a slope due to water run-off and/or wind forces. 
In addition to the primary function, Geosynthetics usually perform one or more secondary 
functions. The primary and secondary functions of geosynthetic make up the total contribution 
material in better way to a particular application. It is important to consider both the primary and 
secondary functions in the design computations and specifications.

Note:	 The given matrix of primary functions is indicative only; each product can have multiple functions 
as per site conditions.
Use and selection of geosynthetics in pavements has to be analysed based on site conditions, 
applicability and project specific requirements with judgement of Engineer in Charge. However, 
before actually begin with design, a designer must give due consideration to “Engineering” and 
“Economic” factors involved in design.

Applicability and Benefits of Geosynthetics in Roadways
1.9.1	
Areas of Application of Geosynthetics in Roads and Pavements
The four main applications for geosynthetics in roads are subgrade separation, stabilization, 
base or subbase reinforcement, and overlay stabilization. Subgrade stabilization and base or 
subbase reinforcement involve improving the road structure as it is constructed by inserting an 
appropriate geosynthetic material.

Conventional construction material like aggregates is becoming progressively scarce on account 
of environmental concerns as well as legal restrictions on quarrying while the construction 
activity has expanded phenomenally. This has shifted focus from large scale use of conventional 
aggregates to use of local, recycled and engineered marginal aggregates in construction. 
Geosynthetics can enhance the properties of such recycled and engineered marginal aggregates 
in construction.
Geosynthetics are also helpful in rehabilitating the distressed road surfaces. The application of 
a layer of bituminous concrete called an overlay is often the solution for damaged pavement. 
Geosynthetics can be used as inter-layers by placing them below or within the overlay. Some 
geosynthetics relieve stress and others are able to reinforce the overlay. The products may also 
provide a moisture barrier. The following are the applications of geosynthetics in roadways and 
pavements in brief:

layers i.e. surface course to increase the service life of the pavement 
by preventing fatigue and reflective cracks.

1.9.2	
Temporary roads, diversions and working platforms in roadway and pavement systems
Geosynthetics are used in temporary roads to reduce rutting of the gravel surface and/or to 
decrease the amount of gravel required to support the anticipated traffic. Furthermore, the 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
14
geosynthetic helps to maintain the aggregate thickness over the life of the temporary road. 
Where the soils are normally too weak to support the initial construction work, geosynthetics 
in combination with gravel provide a working platform to allow construction equipments access 
to sites. This is one of the most important uses of geosynthetics. Even if the finished roadway 
can be supported by the subgrade, it may be virtually impossible to begin construction of the 
embankment or roadway. Such sites require stabilization by dewatering, de-mucking, excavation 
and replacement with selected granular materials, utilization of stabilization aggregate, chemical 
stabilization, etc. Geosynthetics can often be a cost effective alternate to these expensive 
foundation treatment procedures.
1.9.3	
Permanent paved and unpaved roads
For permanent road construction, a temporary working platform can be constructed to provide 
an improved roadbed using geogrid reinforcements with an aggregate layer to provide a form 
of mechanical stabilization. This mechanically stabilized aggregate layer enables contractors 
to meet minimum compaction specifications for the first two or three aggregate lifts. This is 
especially true on very soft, wet subgrade, where the use of ordinary compaction equipment 
is very difficult or even impossible. Long term, a geogrid or, in some cases, a geocomposite 
acts to maintain the roadway design section and the base course material integrity. Thus, the 
geosynthetic will ultimately increase the life of the roadway.
Another geogrid application in roadways is to place the geogrid or geocomposite at the 
bottom or within the base course to provide reinforcement through lateral confinement of the 
aggregate layer. Lateral confinement arises from the development of interface shear stresses 
between the aggregate and the reinforcement and occurs during placement, compaction, and 
traffic loading. A small residual restraint remains after each load application, thus increasing 
the lateral confinement of the aggregate with increasing load applications. Base reinforcement 
thus improves the long-term structural support for the base materials and reduces permanent 
deformation in the roadway section and has been found under certain conditions to provide 
significant improvement in pavement performance.

CHAPTER - 2 
PROPERTIES AND TEST METHODS FOR DIFFERENT GEOSYNTHETIC MATERIALS
Geosynthetic Materials shall be Tested and Certified in the following manner:
•	
The manufacturer shall have ISO or CE certification for manufacturing process and 
quality control.
•	
The manufacturer shall provide manufacturer’s test certificate for every lot supplied 
from the factory.
•	
The supplier shall provide third party test reports from an independent laboratory with 
valid accreditation for all the test values in Manufacturer’s test certificate.
Geosynthetics shall be tested in accordance with tests prescribed by relevant BIS, ISO, ASTM, 
EN or BS shall be conducted.
2.1 
Typical and Minimum Average Roll Values of the Geosynthetics
2.1.1	
The term ‘Typical Value’ and Minimum Average Roll Value; both relate to the variability 
inherent in geosynthetic material properties. This variability stems from the manufacturing 
process and is similar to that which occurs with all construction materials, including concrete 
and steel. Geosynthetics manufacturers continuously perform Quality Control (QC) testing to 
monitor the physical properties of their products. Using the result of this testing, manufacturer 
can represent physical properties statistically in normal distribution curves as shown in Fig. 2.1.
2.1.2	
The “typical” value refers to the average or mean value and is valid for any geosynthetic 
material. As shown in Fig. 2.1 (a) 50 per cent of the test results can be expected to exceed this 
value and 50 per cent can be expected to fall below this value. The ‘minimum average roll value” 
(MARV) is 97.7 per cent as per clause no. 3.1 IS 16362 as shown in Fig. 2.1 (b). The MARV is 
derived statistically as the average value minus two standard deviations.

Fig. 2.1 Statistical Distribution of the Geosynthetic Material Properties
2.1.3	
Specification sheet of a geosynthetic material should list the physical properties 
required to serve its intended function. The civil engineering community has adopted standards 
for verifying the physical properties of geosynthetic material in accordance with the MARV. A 
specification based on the MARV means that 97.7 per cent of the product is required to meet or 
exceed the specified values. In contrast, if a manufacturer certifies to higher “typical” values only 
lesser percentage of the product would meet the specified values.

16
2.1.4	
Designers must rely on a statistical basis for assuring that the geosynthetic materials 
delivered to the job meet the specifications. On any given project, the minimum average roll 
value must meet or exceed the designer’s specified value for the product to be acceptable.
2.2	
Geotextile
This section gives an insight into various properties of geotextiles and test methods in use or 
currently favoured for testing of geotextiles as per existing worldwide standards. This section 
has been subdivided into following three major categories:
•	
Physical properties
•	
Mechanical properties
•	
Hydraulic properties
2.2.1	
Physical properties: The properties, discussed in the subsection, refer to fabric in its 
manufactured or as received condition. Physical properties are considered to be index properties 
of geotextiles.
2.2.1.1	
Specific gravity: Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of material’s unit volume weight 
(without any voids) to that of distilled, de-aired water at 27°C. The specific gravity of fibres from 
which geotextiles are made is actually the specific gravity of the polymer raw material (ISO 
1183, ASTM D792 or ASTM D1505). Some typical values of specific gravity of commonly used 
polymeric materials made into geotextiles are as follows:
Polypropylene
:
0.91
Polyester
:
1.22 to 1.38
Nylon
:
1.05 to 1.14
Polyethylene
:
0.90 to 0.96
Polyvinyl chloride
:
1.69
2.2.1.2	
Mass per unit area (weight): Mass per unit area governs the fabric cost and normally 
mechanical properties are directly related to it. Test wise, the mass (weight) should be measured 
to the nearest 0.01 per cent of the total specimen mass. Length and width should be measured 
under zero tension induced in geotextile. Methods for this test are based on ISO 9864, IS 14716 
and ASTM D5261. The geotextiles mass per unit area is given in grams per square meter. The 
range of typical values for most geotextiles is from 100 to 1000 gm/m2.
2.2.1.3	
Thickness: Thickness is measured as the distance between the upper and the lower 
surface of the fabric, measured at a specified pressure. ISO 9863-1, IS 13162 (Part 3) and 
ASTM D5199 stipulates that thickness is to be measured to an accuracy of at least 0.01 mm 
under a pressure of 2 kPa. According to ISO the thickness should be measured after 30 seconds 
of application of full force, where, as per ASTM the duration is 5 seconds only. The thickness of 
the commonly used geotextiles ranges from 0.25 to 7.5 mm. 
2.2.2	
Mechanical properties: The mechanical properties to be discussed here indicate the 
geotextiles resistance to tensile stresses mobilized under applied loads and/or installation conditions. 
The index tests such as wide width tensile strength, grab strength, puncture strength and sewn seam 
strength are used for determining the mechanical properties of the geotextiles.



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
17
2.2.2.1	
Tensile strength: ISO 10319 or IS 13325 or ASTM D4595 gives test method for the 
determination of the tensile properties of geotextile and related products, using a wide-width 
strip. This test is applicable to most of the geotextile families including woven, non-woven, geo 
composites, knitted fabrics and felts. The reason wide-width specimens are necessary that 
geotextiles when tensioned tend to have a severe necking effect under increasing stress and 
they rope up, giving artificially high values. Thus, the tendency for design-related tests is to use 
wide-width specimens.
Grab strength test will also be applicable for the determination of tensile properties of geotextiles. 
ISO 13934 or IS 16342 or ASTM D4632 shall be used to evaluate the grab strength of geotextiles. 
Narrow Strip Test as per ASTM D751 is another tensile test method.
2.2.2.2	
Puncture strength: This test is conducted to make an assessment of geotextile 
resistance to objects, such as, rocks or pieces of wood under quasi-static conditions and reported 
as N or kN. Such a test described under ISO 12236, IS:13162 (Part 4) and ASTM D6241, IS 
16078 shall be used to evaluate the CBR puncture strength of geotextiles.
2.2.2.3	
Sewn seam strength: Seam strength is typically evaluated in the laboratory using ISO 
10321 “Geosynthetics- Tensile test for joints/seams by wide-width strip method” or IS 15060 
or ASTM D4884, “Test Method for Seam Strength of Sewn or Thermally Bonded Seams of 
Geotextiles”. This method tests 200 mm wide specimen and the results have been shown to 
correlate accurately to anticipated field seam strength. 
2.2.3	
Hydraulic properties
Filter system flow capacity or flow rate, q is the quantity of water, which will pass through the 
system in a given period of time. Flow capacity is usually expressed in cm3/sec or cm3/sec/
m2. Properties of both the soil and geotextile influence the hydraulic characteristics of the soil/
geotextile system. Two important properties are soil permeability and geotextile permittivity. 
Other properties are listed in Table 2.1.

2.2.3.1	
Apparent opening size (AOS): The Apparent Opening Size (AOS) or the Equivalent 
Opening Size (EOS) is a measure of the largest effective opening in a geotextile. It can be 
measured using the procedure described below:
Standard Test Methods for Determining Apparent Opening Size of a Geotextile are ISO 12956 
(using the wet sieving principle), IS:14294 and ASTM D4751 (using the dry sieving principle). 
This test method covers the determination the Apparent Opening Size (AOS) of a geotextile by 
sieving glass beads through a geotextile.

Determination of clogging potential of geotextile: IS:16389 “Geosynthetics - Method 
of Test for Biological Clogging of Geotextile or Soil/Geotextile Filters” shall be used to determine 
clogging potential of geotextiles. There are two test methods available to evaluate flow capacity 
of a soil/geotextile system: first one by ASTM D5101, the “Gradient Ratio” and the other by 
“Hydraulic Conductivity Ratio (HCR) Test”. In this test, the soil is compacted and is placed under 
a confining pressure to simulate field conditions. The HCR testing of soil/geotextile systems can 
be conducted using ASTM D5567 method.
2.3	
Geogrid
The primary function of geogrid is improving the geotechnical material property by reinforcing 
and stabilizing. Based on the function and applications of geogrid, its properties are classified 
generally into three categories like, physical, mechanical and endurance properties.
2.3.1	
Physical properties: Many of the physical properties of geogrids-including the type of 
structure, rib dimensions, junction type, aperture size and thickness can be measured directly 
and are relatively straightforward.
2.3.2	
Mechanical properties: As reinforcing is the main function of geogrid, the tensile 
strength of single rib or at junction of geogrid is considered as mechanical properties of geogrid. 
The tensile strength is the maximum resistance to tensile stresses mobilized under applied loads 
and/or installation conditions. Nodal strength test and wide width strength tests are general tests 
to be conducted to determine the tensile strength of geogrids.



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
19
2.3.2.1	
Single rib and junction (nodal strength): The initial tendency when assessing a 
geogrid’s tensile strength is to pull a single rib in tension until failure and then to note its 
behaviour. A single rib tension strength test merely uses a constant rate-of-extension testing 
machine to pull a single rib to failure, as described in ASTM D6637. For unidirectional geogrids, 
this would most likely be a longitudinal rib. For bidirectional geogrids, both longitudinal and 
transverse ribs require evaluation. By knowing the repeat pattern of the ribs, equivalent wide-
width strength can be calculated. Alternatively, a number of ribs can be tested simultaneously 
to obtain a more statistically accurate value for the wide-width strength. Geogrid for use as 
reinforcement of base and sub-base layers of flexible pavements shall be tested according to 
the references mentioned in Table 2.3.

2.3.2.2	
Wide-width tensile strength: Clearly the wide-width tensile strength of a geogrid, in its 
machine direction for unidirectional geogrids and in both machine and cross-machine directions 
for bidirectional geogrids, is of prime importance. ISO 10319 or IS 13325 or ASTM D6637 wide-
width strength testing of geogrids can be referred to determine the tensile strength of geogrids.
2.3.3	
Endurance properties: As geogrids are used in critical reinforcement applications, some 
of which require long service lifetime; it is generally necessary to evaluate selected endurance 
properties. Installation damage, creep and accelerated test methods will be addressed in this section.
2.3.3.1	
Installation damage: As with all geosynthetic, the placement of geogrids in the field 
requires a considerable degree of planning and care. As happens all too often with careless field 
construction crews and heavy machinery, installation damage of the geogrid can occur. Other 
uncertainties in this same area are coarse soil impingement, falling objects and other accidents 
that may occur before the geogrid is covered. There is a formalized procedure available to 
assess installation damage as per ISO 10722. ASTM D5818-06 may be referred for exposure 
and retrieval of sample to evaluate installation damage of geosynthetics.
Generally, the higher strength-loss values come about where large, poorly graded, quarried 
aggregate is used and heavy construction equipment performs the placement and compaction. 
If it is necessary to use such materials and methods; it is prudent to first place a cushioning layer 
of sand above and sometimes below the geogrid.
2.3.3.2	
Tensile creep behaviour: Sustained-load deformation or tensioned creep is one of 
the major endurance properties of geogrid. Since geogrids are manufactured from polymers 
consisting of long-molecules arranged in crystalline regions with interspersed amorphous 
regions, the creep response reflects upon the per cent crystallinity.

Creep is predominantly a function of stress level, time, temperature and a number of environmental 
factors. The tensile creep test has been adopted from ISO 13431, ASTM D6992 and ASTM 
D5262. Consideration of creep reduction factor for reinforcement application of geosynthetics in 
reinforced soil systems reference may be made to IRC:SP:102, MoRTH Section 3100.
2.3.4	
Degradation issues: For all types of geogrids being used in permanent reinforcement 
applications, it is generally necessary to evaluate selected degradation considerations. This 
section briefly discusses some of these issues.
2.3.4.1	
Temperature effects: Given the temperature ranges of typical environments, 
temperature extremes (hot or cold) should have no serious adverse effects on geogrids. The one 
caution is that high temperature can exhibit strains arising from tension creep, creep rupture, 
and/or stress relaxation.
2.3.4.2	
Oxidation effects: EN ISO 13438 test method can be used for determining the 
resistance to oxidation (ISO 13438).This method for screening the resistance to oxidation, in 
particular applicable to polypropylene and polyethylene based products.
2.4	
Geomembrane
2.4.1	
Physical properties: Physical properties have to do with the geomembranes in an as-
manufactured and/or as-received state. They are important for quality control, quality assurance 
and proper identification.
2.4.1.1	
Thickness: Depending on the type of geomembranes, there are three types of 
thickness to be considered: (1) Thickness of smooth sheet, (2) The core thickness of textured 
sheet, and (3) Thickness (or height) of the asperities of textured sheet.
Smooth Sheet: The determination of the thickness of a smooth geomembranes is performed by 
a straightforward measurement. The test uses an enlarged-area micrometer under a specified 
pressure, resulting in the desired value. ISO 09863 and ASTM D5199 is the test methods 
generally used for measuring geomembranes thickness. 
Textured Sheet: The roughened surface of a textured geomembranes results in a significant 
increase in its interface friction with adjacent materials versus the same geomembranes 
with a smooth surface. The thickness of such textured sheets is measured as the minimum 
core thickness between the roughened peaks or asperities. To measure the core thickness, 
a tapered-point micrometer for measuring machine screw threads is recommended. 
The tapered point dimensions as per ASTM D5994 are a 60° angle with the extreme tip at 
0.08 mm diameter. The normal load on tapered point is 0.56N.
Asperity Height: For textured geomembranes, the height of the asperity is of interest inso far as 
it relates to mobilizing the desired amount of interface shear strength with the opposing surface. 
Less involved, but still useful as a quality control and quality assurance method, is to merely 
measure the height of the asperities per ASTM D7466.
2.4.1.2	
Melt (flow) index: The melt-flow index or melt index (MI) test should be used by 
geomembranes manufacturers as a method of controlling polymer uniformity and process ability. 
The test method often used for geomembranes polymers is ASTM D1238.

Mass per unit area (weight): This test is straightforward to perform and usually follows 
ISO 9864 or ASTM D3776 procedures.
2.4.2	
Mechanical properties
2.4.2.1	
Tensile behaviour: The test procedures generally used are covered in ISO 527-3, 
ASTM D6693 or as well as ASTM D6392, D882, D751, and D413.
2.4.2.2	
Tear resistance: The measurement of tear resistance of a geomembrane can be done 
using ASTM D1004. ASTM D1004 uses a template to form a test specimen shaped such as to 
have a 90˚ angle where tear can begin to propagate.
2.4.2.3	
Puncture resistance: To measure puncture resistance ASTM D4833 is often used 
since it is the test method used by manufacturers for quality control purposes.
2.4.3	
Endurance properties
2.4.3.1	
Oxidation: There are two related test methods that are used to track the amount and/
or depletion of antioxidants. They are called Oxidative Induction Time (OIT) tests.
Standard OIT (ISO 11357 or ASTM D3895): The oxidation is conducted at 35 kPa and 200°C. 
This test appears to misrepresent antioxidant packages containing thiosynergists and/or hindered 
amines due to the relatively high test temperature.
High Pressure OIT (ASTM D5885): The oxidation is conducted at 3500 kPa and 150°C. This 
test can be used for all types of antioxidant packages and is the preferred test.
A summary of properties of geomembranes and testing procedure is listed in Table 2.4 below:

Geonet/Geospacer
The primary function of a geonet/geospacer is to convey liquid within the plane of its structure. 
The inplane flow rate or Transmissivity is an important design parameter. However, other features, 
which may influence this value over the service lifetime of the geonet, are also of importance. 
Thus a number of physical, mechanical, endurance, and environmental properties will also be 
presented in this section.
2.5.1	
Physical properties
2.5.1.1	
Density: The density or specific gravity of the polymer is an important property and it 
can be evaluated either by ASTM D1505 or D792.
2.5.1.2	
Thickness: Thickness can be determined using ISO 9863/IS 13162 Part-3, ASTM 
D5199.
2.5.1.3	
Mass per unit area: This can be determined using ISO 9864/ASTM D3776. Other 
physical properties such as rib dimensions, planar angles made by the intersecting ribs, cross-
planar angles made at the juncture locations, aperture size and shape can be measured directly.
2.5.2	
Mechanical properties
2.5.2.1	
Tensile strength and elongation: ISO 10319 or IS 13325 or ASTM D4595 gives index 
test method for the determination of the tensile properties of geonet/geospacer, using a wide-
width strip.
2.5.2.2	
Compressive strength and deformation: ASTM D6364, “Standard method for 
determining the short-term compressive strength of geosynthetic” is used to evaluate the short-
term compressive strength parameters of geonet.
2.5.2.3	
Shear strength: The appropriate interface shear test method is ISO 12957-1 or ASTM 
D5321, and it is obviously a product-specific and site-specific test that must be performed for 
each set of conditions that arise.
2.5.3	
Hydraulic properties
The in-plane hydraulic test to determine planar flow rate, or transmissivity, of geonets should be 
performed using ISO 12958 and ASTM D4716. Both test methods use a planar transmissivity 
device and not the radial transmissivity device this is necessary because the flow regime in a 
geonet is surely turbulent (consisting of irregular flow paths and eddies).

======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
23
2.5.4	
Endurance properties: The major endurance properties of concern when using 
geonets have to do with the long-term sustained deformation of the material and its ability to 
continue to transmit the required in-plane flow rate.
Type of polyethylene resin: Depending upon the type of polyethylene resin, primarily 
characterized by its density, the geonet will have different mechanical and endurance properties. 
The high density resins (e.g., greater than 0.950 mg/l), will result in relatively high modulus, high 
strength and high creep resistance. Conversely, lower density resins (e.g., less than 0.945 mg/l) 
will be more flexible and can deform under high compressive stresses more easily.
Intrusion of adjacent materials into the geonet’s apertures: All geospacers or geonets will 
necessarily be covered on their upper and lower surfaces with geotextiles, geomembranes, 
concrete wall surface, or some other material. If the geonet’s surfaces are not covered, the 
adjacent soil will invade its apertures, rendering flow impossible. For this reason all flow tests 
should be conducted with soft foam rubber platens on both sides to simulate soil intrusion, 
unless the designer can demonstrate that hard platens on one or both sides are representative 
of the conditions that the drainage core will encounter during operations. Intrusion refers to 
the deformation of the flexible covering materials, primarily geotextiles, occupying some of the 
geonet’s void space.

knitted or bonded together). They can be used for permanent erosion control problems. The 
roots of grass and small plants act as reinforcement for vegetation. These are two-dimensional

(folded and knitted or bonded together), with apertures to allow vegetation growth for erosion 
control application.

CHAPTER - 3 
DESIGN METHODOLOGIES
General
The performance of reinforced road structures relies heavily on the condition of surrounding 
materials and on the traffic loads and therefore each design requires specific analysis and 
calculations. 
Proposed design methods for different functions of geosynthetics such as reinforcement, 
separation, drainage, filtration in pavement section are either based on empirical and analytical 
considerations or analytical models modified by experimental data. To date, a general analytical 
design solution has not been found that addresses all of the many variables that impact 
performance. All empirical design methods are limited by the conditions associated with the 
experiments of the study. Several methods are based on obtaining a performance level (Traffic 
Benefit Ratio [TBR] or Base Course Reduction [BCR]) from a laboratory model test. The lab 
test results must be extrapolated to field conditions for application to design. For a given set of 
conditions, many of the methods produce reliable results. This chapter provides the currently 
available and generally used design methodologies for several functions described in these 
guidelines. 
Material properties, specifications and minimum thickness requirements of each pavement layer 
will remain same as specified in other relevant codes, guidelines for pavement construction 
(IRC:37 and other relevant codes). The surface and subsurface drainage of the pavement shall 
comply with provisions of IRC:SP:42.
3.1 
Design for Reinforcement of Unbound Pavement Layers
Pavement reinforcement involves reinforcing different layers of the pavement. Geosynthetics 
are incorporated into base and subbase section for following reasons:
1.	
To provide subgrade restraint for construction of the road over weak subgrade 
conditions. 
2.	
To reinforce the base and/or sub base
3.1.1	
Basic mechanism
Basic mechanism of reinforcement can be identified as (a) lateral restraint, (b) improved bearing 
capacity, and (c) tensioned membrane effect.
Lateral restraint (Fig. 3.1(a)) refers to the confinement of the aggregate material during loading, 
which restricts lateral flow of the material from beneath the load. Since most aggregates used 
in pavement systems are stress-dependent materials, improved lateral confinement results in 
an increase in the modulus of the base course material. The effect of increasing the modulus 
of the base course is an improved vertical stress distribution applied to the subgrade and a 
corresponding reduction in the vertical strain on the top of the subgrade. Improved bearing 
capacity is achieved by shifting the failure envelope of the pavement system from the relatively 
weak subgrade to the relatively strong base course material (Fig. 3.1(b)). The third fundamental 
reinforcement mechanism has been termed the “tensioned membrane effect.” The tensioned

membrane effect (Fig. 3.1(c)) is based upon the concept of an improved vertical stress distribution 
resulting from tensile stress in a deformed membrane.

3.1.2	
Design of geogrid reinforced flexible pavements
Geogrid reinforced flexible pavement section can be designed based on two design approaches 
i.e. MEPDG (Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide) method following MIF (Modulus 
Improvement Factor) and Modified AASHTO method following LCR (Layer Coefficient Ratio).
The approach to flexible pavement design according to modified AASHTO method is similar for 
reinforced and unreinforced pavements and can be divided into two steps: 
	
1.	
Determination of structural number for a given traffic load, project conditions and 
arriving unreinforced section thickness for individual pavement layers.
	
2.	
Determination of reduced thickness by incorporating the effect of geosynthetic 
in the form of improvement factor in the obtained SN. 
3.1.2.1	
AASHTO design method 
The basic design equation for flexible pavements according to AASHTO 1993 design guide has 
the following form:

The AASHTO method utilizes the term Structural Number (SN) to quantify the structural strength 
of a pavement required for a given combination of soil support, total traffic, reliability, and 
serviceability level. The required SN is converted to actual thickness of surfacing, base and 
sub base, by means of appropriate layer coefficients representing the relative strength of the 
construction materials. The design equation used is as follows:
	
SN = a1D1 + a2D2m2 + a3D3m3+...

Modified AASHTO method with geogrids for base/sub base stabilization
The structural contribution of a geogrid on a flexible pavement system can be quantified by 
an empirical term defined as layer coefficient ratio (LCR). Hence the equation 2 is modified as 
below.
	
 SN = a1 x D1 + LCR2 x a2 x D2 x m2 + LCR3 x a3 D3 m3 + ...
(3)
Where: LCR is the Layer Coefficient Ratio, with a value higher than one 
Layer coefficient ratio represents the improvement/enhancement provided by a specific geogrid 
to the layer coefficient of the layer in which the geogrid is placed (most commonly a base course 
and subbase course or both).
This value is back-calculated, based upon the number of load cycles on a reinforced section 
to the number of load cycles on an unreinforced section, with the same geometry to reach 
the defined failure state. Appropriate empirical value of LCR may be used. Such values are 
normally provided by the manufacturer based on their field and laboratory testing for various 
materials. These factors may differ from product to product. Agency-Specific evaluation 
to select appropriate empirical ratio is recommended. Such evaluation shall be tailored 
to local materials, practice, costs. Furthermore, agency specific evaluation should provide 
the designers with guidance on value of reliability for reinforced pavement. A general 
procedure for the determination of LCR by extensive laboratory and filed testing is provided 
in Annexure II.
According to FHWA NHI-07-092, based on the AASHTO, 1993 design guide, the overall structural 
contribution of geosynthetic reinforcement is considered in the design through either of the 
following factors that are derived from empirical product specific data: 
−	
Traffic Benefit Ratio (TBR) - the ratio of the number of load applications necessary to 
reach a specific failure state in a geosynthetic-reinforced pavement to the number of 
load applications required to reach the same failure state in an unreinforced section 
(i.e., the same pavement section but without reinforcement).

−	
Base Course Reduction Factor (BCR) - the per cent reduction in the thickness of 
base or subbase material in a reinforced pavement compared to an unreinforced one, 
given that the traffic capacity for a defined failure state remains the same.
3.1.2.3	
Design procedure for geogrid reinforced flexible pavement
IRC:37 provides design procedure for unreinforced section. As many of the parameters used 
are still empirical, the equation requires modification to include the benefit of reinforcement 
in the pavement layers. Hence to take the advantage of empirical and mechanistic empirical 
methodologies, reinforced pavement design shall be done in the following procedure. Design for 
geogrid reinforced pavement design procedure shall be done in two parts:
a)	
Determine the conventional unreinforced pavement section as per IRC:37 for given 
sub grade CBR, design traffic.
b)	
Determine the improved layer parameters by inclusion of geogrid in different layers. 
Using these improved parameters, reinforced section shall be designed with same 
methodology as per IRC:37 and calculation of fatigue and rutting resistance of geogrid 
reinforced pavement section.
The detailed design procedure for geogrid reinforced pavement section.
1.	
Determine the sub grade CBR and design traffic load for which the flexible pavement 
is to be designed. Unreinforced section thickness shall be determined according to 
the IRC:37 for specified sub grade CBR and Design Traffic.
2.	
Resilient moduli MR_GB and MR_GSB are evaluated for the base and sub-base.
3.	
The tensile horizontal and vertical strains are evaluated for the conventional section 
at Points A and B for the given subgrade CBR and traffic/pavement life.
4.	
Structural layer coefficients a2, a3 for granular base and subbase layer of unreinforced 
section shall be determined from its resilient modulus using following equations from 
AASHTO 1993.
	
a2 = 0.249 (log10 MR_GB) – 0.977
(4)
	
a3 = 0.227 (log10 MR_GSB) – 0.839
(5)
	
Where MR_GB and MR_GSB are resilient modulus of base and subbase layers
5.	
Benefit of inclusion of geogrid reinforcement in the pavement layers will be represented 
in improvement of resilient modulus of respective layer. Consider the layer within 
which the geogrid is placed, base, or sub-base, or both. Accordingly the corresponding 
structural layer coefficient(s) is/are modified by multiplying by the corresponding linear 
coefficient ratios.
	
LCR2a2 = 0.249 (log10 M1
R_GB) – 0.977
(6)
	
LCR3a3 = 0.227 (log10 M1
R_GSB) – 0.839
(7)
	
Where M1
R_GB and M1
R_GSB are modified resilient modulus of base and subbase layers.
6.	
From equation (6) and/or (7), M1
R_GB and/or M1
R_GSB are evaluated.
7.	
M1
R_GB and/or M1
R_GSB are then used to determine the reduced thicknesses of the 
pavement components.
8.	
Further, these values are imposed in the IRC recommended IITPAVE software and 
evaluated for the strain values as shown in below Fig. 3.2.

Fig. 3.2 Critical Points for Evaluation of Horizontal and Vertical strains
9.	
By using critical tensile strain and compressive strain induced at the bottom of the 
bituminous course and top of the sub grade respectively, the allowable traffic should 
be determined for fatigue and rutting failures using equations from IRC:37.
10.	
If obtained strain values are less than the permissible strain values the section is safe 
for pavement life in rutting and fatigue and may be adopted for the construction.
In this way the advantages of both, Mechanist Empirical method from IRC:37 (for unreinforced 
road design) and modified AASHTO 1993 method (for reinforced road design) are taken into 
consideration in designing geogrid reinforced section. This design procedure for geogrid 
reinforced flexible pavements can be adopted for any subgrade CBR values and any traffic 
values.
Value of LCR depends on stiffness of geogrid, CBR of subgrade, and depth of placement of 
reinforcement. Table 3.1 below gives recommended range of LCR values that may be adopted 
in design. In the absence of LCR value for a particular geogrid reinforced pavement system, LCR 
equal to 1.2 may be taken as a default value for design. If the manufacturer/designer intends 
to use higher LCR values in the design, then such values shall be based on proper testing/
evaluations. Annexure I provide procedure for determination of layer coefficients from Falling 
Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and CBR values. Such higher values obtained through testing 
shall be verified and certified by an independent third-party agency/institution.

product, subgrade and granular layer properties. However actual certified values shall be used in 
the design subject to the maximum value in the table.

* It may be noted for CBR <3, geogrids of higher strengths and stiffness higher LCR may be 
considered.
	
Default minimum values are applicable for the stabilized layer using geogrid i.e. base, subbase 
and subgrade layers of the pavement section. For properties of geogrid and test methods, Section 
4.6.2 and Table 2.3 shall be referred to.
Haas et al. (1988) after performing laboratory experiments concluded the importance of 
variables such as geogrid placement position, base course thickness, and subgrade strength. 
The optimum geogrid location for lower thicknesses (< 150 mm) shall be at the bottom of the 
layer and for the higher thicknesses (> 150 mm) it shall be at 1/3rd to half of thickness from top. 
For very soft subgrades (CBR≤3%), optimum performance occurs with two layers of geogrids 
when geosynthetic shall be used in separate layers of base and sub base.
Drainage coefficients: The drainage characteristics of the pavement are accounted for the use of 
modified layer coefficients. AASHTO 1993 (Pg. No. II- 22) presents the definitions of suggested 
drainage levels. The drainage characteristic of the bituminous layer (Layer 1) is not considered 
in design. For accounting the mi values in the design of pavement, ASSHTO 1993 (Table 2.4, 
Pg. No. II-25) presents the recommended mi values as a function of the drainage quality and 
the percentage of time during the year the pavement structure would normally be exposed to 
moisture levels approaching saturation.
3.1.3	
Design of geosynthetic (geocell/geogrid) reinforced flexible pavement using Modulus 
improvement factor (MIF)
Geocell/Geogrid reinforced/stabilised flexible pavement design is based on Mechanistic 
Empirical approach as given in IRC:37. This design procedure can be adopted for any subgrade 
CBR values and any traffic values.
Step wise design procedure for geocell/geogrid reinforced flexible pavement is as follows:
1.	
Determine the soaked subgrade CBR as per IS 2720-Part 16 design traffic load from 
traffic survey.
2.	
Selection of conventional pavement as per IRC:37 for specific subgrade CBR and 
design traffic.
3.	
Since geocell/geogrid can be used in base/subbase layer and so the elastic modulus 
of corresponding layer shall increase due to confinement action of Geocell and 
confinement, tension membrane action and bearing capacity improvement action of 
geogrid. This increased modulus of confined base/subbase layers may be computed 
by applying a Modulus Improvement Factor (MIF) to the unconfined modulus of base 
material.
E reinforced base/subbase layer = MIF × E unreinforced base/subbase layer
4.	
Based on this increased modulus of base layer the strain at the bottom of the asphalt 
layer shall be again calculated. By trial and error method thickness of surface layer 
shall be reduced in a manner that the tensile strain at the bottom of surface layer is 
less or equal to that of conventional section.
5.	
For this reinforced section with reduced surface layer thickness, determine the 
compressive strain at the top of subgrade.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:59-2019

6.	
Based on tensile strain and compressive strain calculate the fatigue and rutting 
resistance (NF and NR respectively) from equations given in IRC:37. The fatigue and 
rutting resistance must be greater or equal to design traffic load.
This MIF has a very crucial role in design and must be evaluated from field and laboratory 
testing. MIF depends on geosynthetic material type and their properties and stiffness and shear 
strength of different fill soil. Precise MIF can be taken from manufacturer based on their field and 
laboratory testing for specific size and material. However, it is recommended to ensure correct 
MIF for proper optimized design and MIF must be verified by appropriate testing for some trial 
patch before full fledge execution of the work. Only third party validated MIF values must be 
used for the design. The indicative range of MIF values for geogrid to be used in the design shall 
be 1.2 to 2, and for geocell these ranges shall be as per Table 3.2.

These values may differ from product to product, subgrade and granular layer properties. Higher 
MIF values may also be considered subjected to actual certified values as per test results subject 
to the maximum value in the Table 3.2.
Design of geosynthetic reinforced flexible pavement can be followed by either LCR approach 
or MIF approach, based on the availability of coefficient values which represents the benefit of 
geosynthetic in pavement layers.
3.1.4	
Material properties
Regardless of the design procedure, it is essential that the material properties are adopted only 
after conducting relevant tests on the materials. Grade of bitumen and recommended modulus 
values, poison ratios, minimum thickness requirements, reliability specified in IRC:37 shall also 
be applicable for geosynthetic reinforced pavement design.
3.2 
Designing for Separation
Separation is the major function of geotextile. In the pavement applications, the best use of 
geotextile as separators illustrates when it is placed between a reasonably firm soil subgrade 
(beneath) and a stone base course, or aggregate, or ballast above the geotextile. Subgrade 
shall be “reasonably firm” because it is assumed that the subgrade deformation is not sufficiently 
large to mobilize uniformly high-tensile stress in the geotextile. Thus, for a separation function 
to occur, the geotextile has to be placed on the soil subgrade and then have aggregate Base/
Subbase course spread over the geotextile and compacted on top of it (as shown in Fig. 3.3).

Fig. 3.3 Separation Function of Geotextile
For separation design, the base and subbase course thickness required to adequately carry the 
design traffic loads for the design life of the pavement and these thickness not reduced due to the 
use of a geosynthetic. Recall that geotextile separators help prevent pavement failures due to the 
intrusion of finer subgrade soil fractions into the granular base layer(s). Geotextiles separation 
layers may also be used between dense and open graded base layers. Mostly any geotextile 
will work in this application as long as it is strong enough to survive construction. As indicated 
earlier, filtration is a secondary function in this application. Therefore, the geotextile should have 
small enough openings to prevent contamination of the base and subbase pavement layers from 
the subgrade materials and be sufficiently permeable (i.e., more permeable than the subgrade) 
to prevent the development of pore water pressure in the subgrade. AASHTO M288, Table 4 
explains the degree of survivability of geotextile for different subgrade conditions.
3.3 
Design for Filtration
The geotextile must prevent in-situ soil from being washed into the system without clogging over 
time. FHWANHI-070-092 Section 2.3 presents the basic principles, geotextile filter design and 
selection.
3.4 
Design for Drainage Applications
Water in pavement systems is one of the principal causes of pavement distress. It is well known 
that improved roadway drainage extends the life of a roadway system. Modern roadways 
incorporating good drainage are predicted to have a design life of up to two to three times 
over that of undrained pavement sections. This section provides design guidance for a new 
alternative drainage method, which incorporates a Geo Composite drainage layer tied directly 
and continuously into an edge drain system. This Geo Composite drainage layer can be used 
to directly replace drainable aggregate layers in modern rigid or flexible pavement systems. The 
layer can also be used to significantly enhance the drainage of dense graded aggregate layers.

3.4.1	
Design requirements
In order to perform in this application, the geocomposite must have the stiffness required to 
withstand compaction and support traffic without experiencing significant damage due to 
compaction and deformation under cyclic traffic loading. At the same time, the geocomposite must 
have the flow capacity required to rapidly drain the pavement section and prevent saturation of 
the base. As discussed in the previous section, in order to provide optimum drainage, the outflow 
capacity of the drainage layer must be sufficient to drain the pavement section within a few 
hours of a moisture event. The geocomposite must have a high crush resistance to withstand 
construction loading and compaction stresses. A factor of safety of 5 between the anticipated 
load and geocomposite crush resistance as determined by quick load tests is recommended by 
the FHWA to resist creep in geocomposite drains (Christopher et al., 2001). Considering the high 
cost of pavement replacement, it is prudent to consider only high modulus, high compressive 
resistance materials such as geonet drainage composites.
The design of a geocomposite drainage system is carried out as follows:
Identify/set all the design conditions, including (but not limited to):
•	
Types of soil involved (stones, gravel, clay etc.) and their grading curves. 
•	
Environment (aggressive for landfill bottom, medium for landfill capping, ordinary for 
roof gardens etc.). 
•	
Chemical and physical properties of the materials in contact with the geocomposite 
(pH, chemical and biological content, hardness, stiffness etc.) and of the liquid to be 
drained (pH, chemical and biological content, density, viscosity, turbidity etc.). 
•	
Set the boundary conditions (that is the type of materials in contact with the two faces 
of the geocomposite). 
•	
Calculate the maximum applied pressure, the hydraulic gradient and the design input 
flow rate for the geocomposite.
•	
Select one or more geocomposites and for each of them calculate the available flow 
rate for the design conditions of materials in contact with the two faces, maximum 
applied pressure, and hydraulic gradient. 
•	
Compare the available flow rate with the design input flow rate and consider only the 
geocomposites for which the former is larger than the latter. 
•	
Make the final selection of the geocomposite.
•	
Provide design specifications and details, in particular the method for fixing the 
geocomposites on the supporting surface and the connections/overlaps between 
geocomposite rolls and between the geocomposites and other elements of the 
drainage system (manholes, perforated pipes etc.).
3.4.2	
Calculation of input flow rate
The calculation of the input flow rate is project specific.
The generalized equation for input flow rate in the geocomposite is:
	
Q D = FSQ • [(QF / L) + QS]



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
37
Where:
	
QF = Total rainfall flow on the catchment zone (m3/s or l/s)
	
A = Horizontal area of the catchment zone (m2)
	
L = Running length of the geocomposite drain (m)
	
QS = Input flow rate due to additional surficial flow (m³/s/m or l/s/m)
	
FSQ = Factor of Safety on input flow rate 
	
QD = Input flow rate in the geocomposite (m³/s/m or l/s/m)
3.4.3	
Calculation of available flow rate
The flow velocity inside a geocomposite is proportional to the hydraulic gradient (i) which is 
defined as: 
	
i = δh / L 
Where: δh = Hydraulic head loss along the distance L for the fluid flow in the geosynthetic (m)
L = Distance between two points along the average direction of flow in the geosynthetic (m)
Since the design of the drainage system ensures that the available flow rate of the geocomposite 
is always larger than the design input flow rate, pressure flow will never occur and the flow will 
always occur at atmospheric pressure.
The available flow rate of a geocomposite will depend on the types of material in contact with its 
two faces.
It is evident that a very rigid material (concrete slabs in case of rigid pavements etc.) will compress 
and deform the geocomposite evenly, imparting a homogeneous decrease in its thickness, but 
without pushing the geotextile into the channels of the draining core; rigid materials produce 
negligible geotextile intrusion into the core. Conversely, a soft material (like a soil, gravel, ballast) 
in contact with the geocomposite will deform the geotextile, forcing the textile to intrude into 
the draining core with a resulting reduction in the cross-sectional area of the draining core 
and commensurate decrease of the draining capacity. Therefore, the available flow rate of a 
geocomposite with a given structure will be a function of:
•	
Thickness of the geocomposite (H)
•	
Distance (L) between the support points of the geotextile filter
•	
Pressure (P) on the filter
•	
Strength, modulus and tensile creep of the geotextile filter 
•	
Deformability of the material in contact with the geocomposite
•	
Roughness of the geotextile filter
For all applications, the available flow rate of the geocomposite shall be obtained by applying 
a set of reduction factors which take into account all the phenomena that may decrease the 
flow rate over the entire design life compared to the short term flow rate measured in the tests 
according to EN ISO 12958 or ASTM D4716 - 08(2013) standard:

Once the design input flow QD has been calculated, the available input flow Qa shall be calculated 
for one or more geocomposite. 
The final Factor of Safety of Geocomposite FSG afforded by the design with each geocomposite 
is given by:
FSG = Qa / QD
The final selection of the geocomposite shall be done among the geocomposite for which: 
FSG ≥ 1.00 taking into consideration also costs and availability
Once the core is designed to carry the required flow, geotextiles on either side of the core shall 
be designed for separation and filtration as per the requirements. Geotextile separation design 
as per section 3.2 and filter design shall be same as explained in section 3.3. This method of 
drainage is applicable to all types of road construction (whether rigid or flexible) and should be 
preferred wherever economically feasible based on the site conditions.

Geosynthetic Capillary Barrier Drain
Water can travel up to 10 m vertically in silty soils because of capillary action. Two forces affect 
water movement through soils, gravity and capillary action. A capillary barrier forms and restricts 
water flow when two porous materials with differing hydraulic conductivities are in contact.

Fig. 3.4 GCBD Between Base Course and Subgrade Illustrating  
how Water Laterally Drains in Transport Layer
Utilizing a GCBD for pavement drainage explicitly accounts for unsaturated flow, and will result 
in greater drainage efficiency compared to conventional drainage system. With a GCBD, the 
base and subgrade will contain less water than a pavement without a GCBD at any point of time. 
This is important because the strength of both the base course and subgrade degrades with 
increased moisture content and ultimately reduces pavement structural durability. Thus, a GCBD 
will result in increased longevity of the pavement. Expected benefits of the GCBD include:
•	
Reduced equilibrium water content in base 
•	
Prevent positive pressures in base
•	
Prevent wetting of underlying subgrade due to infiltration 
•	
Prevent capillary rise of water from subgrade into base 
•	
Provide complementary separation and stabilization 
Design of geocomposite barrier drain is similar to the design of drainage composite that is 
outlined in the above section 3.4. IRC:34 and IRC:SP:42 shall be referred for detailed design 
procedure and specifications/properties of geocomposite for capillary barrier drain.
3.6 
Design for Asphalt Reinforcement
Reinforcement in asphalt layers such as fabrics, grids or composites can enhance cracking 
and rutting resistance of the asphalt layers significantly if properly applied. This has lead to 
increased use of reinforcement in asphalt layers over the past years throughout the world. Asphalt 
reinforcement prevents reflective cracking, by acting as a barrier against crack propagation.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
40
Fig. 3.5 Reinforcement Action
The crack starts to propagate (due to thermal and traffic loading or uneven soil movements) from 
its original position upward until it reaches the stabilized layer; If the interlayer is stiff enough 
(stiffer than the surrounding materials), the crack will turn laterally and move along the interface 
until its energy is exhausted. Based on this mechanism, a stabilized interlayer may contribute to 
the structural capacity of the pavement.
3.7 
Subgrade Stabilization
The purpose of subgrade modification is to enhance the strength of the subgrade, create a 
working platform for construction equipment. This increased strength is then taken into account 
in the pavement design process. Soil properties such as strength, compressibility, hydraulic 
conductivity, workability, swelling potential, and volume change tendencies may be altered by 
various soil modification or stabilization methods.
The methods of subgrade modification or stabilization include physical processes such as soil 
densification, blending with granular material, use of reinforcements (geosynthetic inclusions), 
undercutting and replacement etc. 
Chemical processes such as mixing with cement, fly ash, lime, lime by products, and blends of 
any one of these materials. Details of cement stabilization are covered in IRC:SP:89 “Guidelines 
for Soil and Granular Material Stabilization Using Cement Lime and Fly Ash”.
For improving the subgrade, several ground improvement methods may also be adopted based 
on available subgrade CBR and the required CBR to be achieved and as per the site feasibilities 
and project requirement. Suitable type of ground improvement shall be chosen accordingly. 
For details regarding several ground improvement methods reference may be made to the 
documents mentioned therein IRC:75, IRC:113, IRC-HRB: SR-13, SR-14.
State of art reports IRC-HRB: SR-13, SR-14 deal with different ground improvements SR-14 
deals with various ground improvement methods including vertical drains (PVDs), lime columns, 
stone columns, geosynthetics and dynamic consolidation.

The purpose of this section is to assist pavement design engineers in the selection and design 
of a Subgrade Enhancement Geosynthetic (SEG).
SEG is a geosynthetic placed between the pavement structure and the subgrade (the subgrade 
is usually untreated). The placement of SEG below the pavement will provide subgrade 
enhancement by bridging soft areas. 
Different types of geosynthetics that are used in subgrade stabilization are geotextiles, geogrids 
and geocell. Geocell, geotextile, geogrid and geosynthetic composites achieve mechanical 
stabilization through slightly different mechanisms.
Subgrade Enhancement Geogrid (SEGG): A geogrid’s primary stabilization mechanism is lateral 
restraint of the subbase or base materials through a process of interlocking the aggregate and the 
apertures of the geogrid. The level of lateral restraint that is achieved is a function of the type of 
geogrid and the quality and gradation of the base or subbase material placed on the geogrid. To 
maximize performance of the geogrid, a well-graded granular base or subbase material should 
be selected that is sized appropriately for the aperture size of the geogrid. When aggregate is 
placed over geogrid, it quickly becomes confined within the apertures and is restrained from 
punching into the soft subgrade and shoving laterally. This results in a “stiffened” aggregate 
platform over the geogrid. Very little deformation of the geogrid is needed to achieve the lateral 
restraint and reinforcement. For longer life, a separator geotextile should be used. Requirement 
of geogrids for stabilization applications shall be as per Table 4.5.
Subgrade Enhancement Geocell (SEGC): Geocell serves as load spreader when loads are 
imposed upon the system. This 3D mattress reduces vertical differential settlement into soft 
subgrades, improves shear strength, and enhances load-bearing capacity, while reducing the 
amount of aggregate material required extending the service life of roads. As a composite system, 
cellular confinement strengthens the aggregate in fill, thereby simultaneously enabling the use 
of poorly graded inferior material (e.g. local native soils, quarry waste or recycled materials) 
for infill as well as reducing the structural support layer thickness. Requirement of geocells for 
stabilization applications shall be as per Table 4.6.
Subgrade Enhancement Geotextile (SEGT): A geotextile’s primary stabilization mechanism is 
filtration and separation of a soft subgrade and the subbase or base materials. The sheet-like 
structure provides a physical barrier between these materials to prevent the aggregate and 
subgrade from mixing. It can also reduce excess pore water pressure through a mechanism 
of filtration and drainage. Secondary mechanisms of a geotextile are lateral restraint and 
reinforcement. Lateral restraint is achieved through friction between the surface of the geotextile 
and the subbase or base materials. Reinforcement mechanism requires deformation of the 
subgrade and stretching of the geotextile to engage the tensile strength and create a “tensioned 
membrane”. Stabilization function of geotextile is applicable to pavement structures constructed 
over soils with a CBR between 1 and 3 (IS 16362). Requirement of geotextiles for stabilization 
applications shall be as per Table 1, IS:16362.
3.8 
Performance Evaluation of Reinforced Flexible Pavements
Performance of reinforced flexible pavements can be evaluated by applying loads on the 
pavements that simulate the traffic loading by measuring the elastic deflection under such loads,

and analysing these data duly considering the factors influencing the performance such as 
subgrade strength, thickness and quality of each of the pavement layers, drainage conditions, 
pavement surface temperature etc.
Among the equipment’s available for structural evaluation of pavements, the Falling Weight 
Deflectometer (FWD) is extensively used world-wide because it simulates, to a large extent, the 
actual loading conditions of the pavement. IRC:115 explains the structural evaluation of flexible 
road pavements using deflection data from Falling Weight Deflectometer.
CHAPTER - 4 
PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS & SELECTION CRITERIA OF  
GEOSYNTHETICS BASED ON FUNCTION
4.1	
General
4.1.1	
This section of the document covers the criteria for selection of a particular type of 
geosynthetic material and its property requirement based on its function and application in road 
works for different project conditions. Specific design and site conditions often require individual 
geosynthetic properties and construction recommendations to be taken care to ensure that the 
chosen geosynthetics are consistent with project needs.
4.2 
Construction Survivability
This section talks about the necessity of provision of geosynthetic and selection of geosynthetic 
material according to the site condition and application of intended. AASHTO 1990 (After Taskforce 
25) provides different cover thicknesses adopted for different site soil CBR and different ground 
contact pressures. 
4.3 
Ultraviolet Stability
4.3.1	
Ultraviolet light degradation is a process where a particular property of a geosynthetic 
is damaged or reduced through its exposure to U-V Rays (sunlight). Typical reductions can be 
seen in the physical properties of geosynthetic material after exposure for a certain period of 
time to sunlight. The rate of deterioration varies with the product, the exposure environment and 
the time of exposure. Atmospheric exposure of geosynthetic material following lay down shall 
be a maximum of 14 days to minimize the damage potential. Table 4.1 gives specifications for 
ultraviolet light degradation.

4.4 
Certificate
4.4.1	
The supplier of any geosynthetic material should provide a certificate to the engineer 
stating the name of the manufacturer, product name, style number, roll number, chemical 
composition of the filaments or yarns and other pertinent information regarding property values 
of individual roll to fully describe the specific geosynthetic material.
4.4.2	
The manufacturer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a quality control 
program to assure compliance with the requirements of the specifications. Documentation 
describing the quality control program shall be made available upon request. The manufacturer’s 
certificate shall state that the furnished geosynthetic material meets MARV requirements of 
the specifications as evaluated under the Manufacturer’s quality control program and are in 
conformance as per ASTM D4759 or equivalent standards/procedures. The certificate shall be 
attested by a person having legal authority to bind the manufacturer.
4.4.3	
Any misrepresentation or mislabelling of materials shall become a sufficient reason to 
reject the geosynthetic products.
4.5	
Separation/Filtration Requirements
In roads and pavements works geotextile is the most preferred geosynthetic material which 
satisfies the function of separation/filtration which prevents intermixing of subgrade soil and 
aggregate cover material (Base/Subbase) with sufficient filtration. Table 4.2 and 4.3 explains the 
geotextile property requirements for separation function.

Base/Subbase Reinforcement Requirements
Geosynthetics have been found to be a cost-effective alternative to improve poor sub-soils in 
adverse locations, in almost all geotechnical engineering projects such as airport and highway 
pavements. For pavement application geotextile, geogrids and geocells will perform this function 
primarily. 
4.6.1	
Geotextile requirements: In some installations, the geotextile can also provide the 
function of reinforcement along with separation and filtration. The geotextile shall meet the 
strength property requirements as specified in Table 4.4a and 4.4b.

Recommendations are for 150 to 300 mm (6 to 12 in.) initial lift thickness. 
For initial lift thicknesses: 
300 to 450 mm (12 to 18 in.): reduce survivability requirement one level;
450 to 600 mm (18 to 24 in.): reduce survivability requirement two level;
>600 mm (24 in.): reduce survivability requirement three level; 
For special construction techniques such as prerutting, increase the geotextile survivability requirement 
one level. Placement of excessive initial cover material thickness may cause bearing failure of the soft 
subgrade. 
4.6.2	
Geogrid requirements: Reinforcement is the primary function of geogrids. It 
performs better than geotextiles in base layer reinforcement mainly because of grid interlock 
with aggregate particles. Poor friction properties of geotextiles do not allow good interlock with 
aggregate particles. The geogrid for use in both base and sub base, shall meet the requirements 
of Table 4.5.

4.6.3	
Geocell requirement: Geocell is a honey comb shaped cellular structure made of 
polymers such as high density polyethylene, polypropylene or alloy material to suit the harsh 
environmental conditions, especially increased temperate in case of flexible pavements where the 
asphalt layers are subjected to very elevated temperatures during installation. Geocell property 
requirements would remain same as given in Table 4.10, except for the cell wall thickness. 
Minimum 1.5 mm cell wall thickness is recommended considering the load bearing application 
of geocell in base and subbase reinforcement.
4.7 
Subsurface Drainage Requirements
4.7.1	
Geotextile property requirements: Geotextiles will become integral part of any structure, 
wherever they are being used. So, it is necessary that the geotextile should possess sufficient 
strength to withstand the construction and other stresses which a fabric is likely to bear during its 
life span. Table 4.6 provides the geotextile property requirements for subsurface drainage. The 
specifications are applicable for placing a geotextile against the soil to allow long term passage 
of water into a subsurface drain system retaining the in-situ soil. For drainage purpose, woven 
slit film geotextiles (i.e. geotextiles made from yarns of a flat, tape like character) should not be 
allowed.

Geocomposite property requirement: Geocomposite shall be able to meet the 
drainage and protection requirements in structurally demanding water draining application. It 
should be able to effectively eliminate hydrostatic pressure against below grade structures and 
aid in dewatering saturated soil by collecting and conveying groundwater to a drain pipe for 
discharge. Geosynthetic drainage composite (drainage composite/Geonet/Geospacer between 
one or two Geotextile layers) shall also satisfy the requirements of subsurface drainage as per 
the site requirement.
Geotextile used in drainage composite shall meet the requirements as specified in Table 4.7. 
The properties of the Geocomposite shall meet the requirements as indicated in Table 4.8.

Erosion Control Requirements
Geotextile, geocell, geogrids and geosynthetic mats are different geosynthetics which will 
perform erosion control function effectively in different applications in roads and pavement works. 
Engineer can select any product based on the project requirement and experience.
4.8.1	
Geotextile requirement: This specification is applicable to the use of a geo-textile 
between energy absorbing armor systems and the in-situ soil to prevent soil loss resulting in 
excessive scour and to prevent hydraulic uplift pressures causing instability of the permanent 
erosion control system. The primary function of the geotextile in erosion control application is 
filtration. Geotextile filtration properties are a function of site hydraulic conditions, in-situ soil 
gradation, density and plasticity. The geotextile requirements for the above applications are 
given in Table 4.9.

4.8.2	
Geocell requirement: For the steep slope vegetation may be difficult to establish and 
it also may not be possible to mitigate potential erosive forces that are likely to overcome the 
strength of the root system. In that cases geocells are effective solution by preventing soil slippage 
and thereby encourage vegetation. Geocell forms a 3 dimensional honey comb structure with 
geocell height of 75 mm to 150 mm when it expanded. Geocells placed on the slope are secured 
to adjoining cell at suitable intervals by using a clip arrangement and these expanded cells 
should be secured to the slope using steel staples typically 300 mm long and 9.5 mm diameter. 
Geocell requirements for erosion control are given in Table 4.10.

time/creep rupture model.
4.8.3	
Geogrid requirement: With the provision of polymer geogrid mesh for root 
reinforcement, extremely high density of grass growth can be achieved. Geogrid reinforcement 
slope protection has been shown to provide erosion protection equivalent to 250 mm thick 
revetment and is treated as an attractive cost-effective alternative solution. Geogrid requirements 
for erosion control shall be in accordance with IRC:56 (Clause No. 5.8).
4.8.4	
Geomat requirement: Vegetation growth for slope protection is very unpredictable 
and unreliable as it may be extremely difficult to achieve 100 per cent vegetation coverage. 
Reinforced vegetation (or reinforced grass) is a better alternative for enhancing slope stability 
and erosion control. The synthetic materials can be of two dimensional polymeric meshes or

three dimensional mats. Three dimensional geosynthetic materials with multi filaments, layers 
of geogrids folded and knitted or bonded together, with specific thickness are effective in this 
application which also known as Rolled Erosion Control Products (RECPs). These geomats 
(3-D mats) are made exclusively from UV stabilized synthetic fibres and filaments processed 
into permanent, high strength, three dimensional matrices. A tension element, i.e., a reinforcing 
element like geogrid or steel wire mesh shall be included along with the three dimensional 
polymeric mats to provide strength against erosive forces, if specified in the contract in case of 
severe environmental conditions.
Table 4.11 and 4.12 provides the property requirements of geosynthetic mats for erosion control 
applications.

Selection criteria for erosion control
4.8.5.1	
The primary function of geotextile used for permanent erosion control is to protect 
the soil beneath it from erosion due to water flowing over the protected soil. The need for a 



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
50
permanent erosion control geotextile depends on the type and magnitude of water flow over 
the soil being considered for protection, the soil type in terms of its erodability, and the type and 
amount of vegetative cover present.
4.8.5.2	
Geocells can be used where heavy runoff or channel scouring is anticipated. Geocells 
filled with concrete can be used to protect bridge aprons, guide bunds and pier areas, abutting 
waterfront as revetment as an alternative to conventional stone/boulder pitching. Geocells can 
be adopted, for the steep slopes where vegetation growth may be difficult and mitigation of 
potential erosive forces to overcome the strength of root system is not possible.
4.8.5.3	
Under erratic weather conditions, successful vegetation growth and its maintenance 
depends on unseasonal rainfall and hence longer life of reinforcing material would be required for 
ensuring vegetation growth apart from contribution of the mesh towards reduction in velocity of surface 
runoff. Use of polymer geogrid mesh provides a permanent protection as it is not biodegradable. 
Because of its longer life and almost unfailing success rate for vegetation growth rate per year, 
polymer geogrid mesh is very favourable over other reinforcing concepts by using natural fibres.
4.8.5.4	
Vegetation along with reinforcement is a better method for enhancing slope stability 
and erosion control where unreliable vegetation growth with 100 per cent coverage is extremely 
difficult. Geosynthetic mats with specific thickness are required to hold the seed mix and polymer 
mat to last for long time. Steel wire mesh is also included in these mats sometimes optionally 
when high strength against erosive forces is required such as in steeper slopes and heavy 
rainfall areas.
4.9 
Asphalt Reinforcement Requirement
Geosynthetics such as geotextiles, geogrids and geocomposites provide the widest range of 
products used for asphalt reinforcement as they are able to withstand high stiffness demand, 
installation damage and loadings.
4.9.1	
Paving fabric requirements: The paving fabric shall be specifically designed for asphalt 
pavement applications and be non-woven, heat bonded on one side. The fabric shall satisfy the 
requirements given in Table 4.13. These specifications are applicable to the use of paving fabric, 
saturated with bitumen, between two bituminous pavement layers. The function of the paving fabric 
is to act as a water barrier and stress relieving membrane within the pavement structure.

Glass fibre geo-grid requirements: Glass fibre geogrid are a flexible reinforcement 
made of high modulus glass fibre yarns which are connected to each other by a special knitting 
process so that an open mesh structure results. These grids are coated with a special PVC 
material/modified polymer that is compatible with bitumen and should be self-adhesive and these 
are generally are supplied with a pressure sensitive adhesive backing. These glass fibre geogrid 
acts as stress relieving interlayer for the purpose of reinforcing asphalt overlay. Table  4.14 
provides the typical specifications of glass fibre geogrid which shall be manufactured from a 
glass fibre roving, resistant to chemical attack (from flux oils, paraffin’s or any other solvents 
used in bituminous binders), mildew and rot.

Composite paving grids: This composites combine the positive effects of paving grid 
such as high strength, high modulus, low creep which affects longevity and performance and 
positive effects of a nonwoven paving fabric. The stabilizing effect of the high strength, low 
strain component in combination with the sealing, stress relieving and uniform adhesive bonding 
properties of the nonwoven paving fabric fleece leads to a dramatic reduction of reflective 
cracking. Specifications for composite paving grid shall meet the requirements given in Tables 
4.15 and 4.16.

Selection criteria for asphalt reinforcement: Three main types of asphalt reinforcements 
with variations thereof are covered in this section, namely, paving fabrics, paving grids (glass fibre 
and polymeric) and composites. Their benefit in the use of joint and localized (spot) pavement 
repairs; full width (curb-to-curb) coverage to provide a moisture barrier for the pavement structure 
and retard reflective cracking in asphalt overlays. Selection of specific asphalt reinforcement is 
particular conditions are based on several design considerations given in Annexure III.
4.10 
Capillary Cut-off
A capillary cut-off could be provided to arrest the capillary rise of water in embankment. Drainage 
composite can be considered as suitable alternatives for capillary cut-off over conventional sand/
granular material.
The drainage composite for capillary cut-off (plastic spacer encased between impermeable layer 
of low density polyethylene geomembrane and non-woven geotextile) of adequate thickness 
over the full width of embankment is recommended as a capillary cut off. By using this drainage 
composite, use of sand blanket can be avoided as generally provided in any other method of 
capillary cut off mentioned as per clause 4.1 to 4.6 of IRC:34. The specifications mentioned as in 
clause 7.2.2.1, IRC:34 are suitable for capillary cut off applications as an alternative for drainage 
and other conventional measures of capillary cut off.
4.10.1	
Geocomposite requirements: Geocomposite capillary break is comprised of a tri-
planar geonet core/Geospacer consisting of thick supporting ribs with diagonally placed top 
and bottom ribs and with thermally bonded nonwoven geotextiles on both sides for Geonet and 
one side for Geospacer. This product is capable of quickly remove surface water infiltrating or 
ground water seeping into the soil base. The product provides a void-maintaining system under 
high normal loads to work as a capillary break; it also works as a separation and sub-base 
reinforcement layer and will have properties conforming to the values and test methods listed in 
IRC:34 (Section 7.2.2.1).

CHAPTER - 5 
CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR USE OF GEOSYNTHETICS IN ROAD WORKS
5.1	
General
The material properties are only one factor in a successful installation using geosynthetics. 
Proper construction and installation techniques are essential in order to ensure that the intended 
function of geosynthetics is fulfilled. Though, the installation techniques appear fairly simple, 
most geosynthetic problems in roadways occur as a result of improper construction techniques. 
If the geosynthetic is ripped or punctured or tore during construction activities, it will not perform 
as desired. If the geosynthetic is placed with lot of wrinkles or folds, it will not be in tension and, 
therefore, cannot provide a reinforcing effect. The following step-by-step procedure should be 
followed in different construction activities with geosynthetics.
The geosynthetics shall not be placed when weather conditions, in the opinion of the engineer, 
are not suitable to allow placement or installation. This will normally be at times of wet conditions, 
heavy rainfall, extreme cold or frost conditions, or extreme heat.
These are general guidelines for the construction and installation; however, manufacturer 
specific installation guidelines and quality control shall be followed subject to the concurrence of 
Engineer-in-charge and project specific requirements.
5.2 
Construction Guidelines for Subsurface Drainage
5.2.1	
Trench excavation shall be done in accordance with details of the project plans. In all 
instances, excavation shall be done in such a way so as to prevent large voids from occurring 
in the sides and bottom of the trench. The graded surfaces shall be smooth and free of debris, 
depression or obstructions.
5.2.2	
The geosynthetic material shall be placed loosely with no wrinkles or folds, and 
with no void spaces between the geosynthetic and the ground surface. Successive sheets of 
geosynthetics shall be overlapped a minimum of 300 mm with the upstream sheet overlapping 
the downstream sheet.
5.2.3	
In trenches equal to or greater than 300 mm in width, after placing the design filter 
material, the geosynthetic shall be folded over the top of the backfill material in a manner to 
produce a minimum overlap of 300 mm. In trenches less than 300 mm but greater than 100 mm 
wide, the overlap shall be equal to the width of the trench. Where the trench is less than 100 mm, 
the geosynthetic overlap shall be sewn or otherwise bonded. All seems shall be subject to the 
approval of the Engineer. In case the geosynthetic gets damaged during installation or drainage 
aggregate placement, a geosynthetic patch shall be placed over the damaged area with minimum 
300 mm overlap all around or the specified seam overlap, whichever is greater.
5.2.4	
Placement of design filter material (as per MoRTH 702.2.3) should proceed immediately 
after placement of the geosynthetic material. The geosynthetic should be covered with a minimum 
of 300 mm of loosely placed aggregate prior to compaction. If a perforated collector pipe is to be 
installed in the trench, a bedding layer of drainage aggregate should be placed below the pipe, 
with the remainder of the aggregate placed to the minimum required construction depth.
5.2.5	
The aggregate should be compacted to a minimum of 90 per cent of standard proctor 
density. Figs. 5.1 to 5.3 illustrate various geosynthetic drainage application details.

5.3 
Construction Guidelines for Separation/Filtration/Subgrade/Base/Subbase 
Reinforcement Function
These construction guidelines are related to placing a geosynthetic material between base or 
subbase and subgrade for any of the following applications:
•	
Base or Subbase Separation
•	
Base or Subbase Stabilization
•	
Base or Subbase Capillary Barrier
•	
Base or Subbase Reinforcement
5.3.1	
The site should be cleared, grubbed and excavated to design grade, stripping all 
topsoil, or any other unsuitable materials. If moderate site conditions exist, i.e., CBR greater than 
1, lightweight profiling operations should be considered to locate unsuitable materials. Isolated 
pockets where additional excavation is required should be backfilled.
5.3.2	
During stripping operations, care should be taken not to excessively disturb the 
subgrade. This may require the use of lightweight dozers or graders for low strength, saturated, 
non-cohesive and low-cohesive soils. In this case, all vegetation should be cut at the ground 
surface. Sawdust or sand can be placed over stumps or roots that extend above the ground 
surface to cushion the geosynthetic. The subgrade preparation must correspond to the 
survivability properties of the geosynthetic.
5.3.3	
Once the subgrade along a particular segment of the road alignment has been 
prepared, the geosynthetic should be rolled in line with the placement of the aggregate. Field 



======================================================================

operations can be expedited if the geosynthetic is pre-sewn to design widths in the factory or on 
firm ground so it can be unrolled on site in one continuous sheet. The geosynthetic should not 
be dragged across the subgrade. The entire roll should be placed and rolled out as smoothly 
as possible. Wrinkles and folds in the fabric should be removed by stretching and stacking as 
required.
5.3.4	
Adjacent rolls of geosynthetic should be overlapped. For curves, the geosynthetic 
should be folded or cut and overlapped in the direction of construction. For separation, drainage 
and capillary barrier applications, geosynthetics shall be sewn or joined as required. Folds in the 
geosynthetic should be stapled or pinned approximately 0.6 m centre-to-centre as shown in Fig. 
5.4 (a) and (b).

5.3.5	
Before covering, the condition of the geosynthetic should be checked for damage (i.e., 
holes, nips, tears, etc.) by an Engineer experienced in the use of these materials. If excessive 
defects are observed, the section of the geosynthetic material containing the defect should be 
repaired by placing a new layer of geosynthetic over the damaged area in case of geotextiles 
and geomembrane for separation, drainage and capillary barrier applications. The minimum 
required overlap for adjacent rolls should extend beyond the defect in all directions. Alternatively, 
the entire defective section can be replaced. In case of geogrids and geocells for reinforcement 
and stabilization function, if the material is damaged, placing a new layer over damaged portion 
won’t provide membrane effect and intended function may not fulfil. In those cases replacing 
with a new material for entire design role length of geosynthetic material in transverse direction 
is advisable. 
5.3.6	
The first lift of aggregate should be spread and graded to 300 mm, or to design 
thickness if less than 300 mm prior to compaction. At no time should traffic be allowed on a soft 
roadway with less than 200 mm of aggregate over the geosynthetic.
5.3.7	
Any ruts that form during construction should be filled to maintain adequate cover 
over the geosynthetic. In no case should ruts be bladed down, as this would decrease the 
amount of aggregate cover over the geosynthetic.
5.3.8	
All remaining base aggregates should be placed in lifts not exceeding 250 mm in 
loose thickness and compacted to the specified density. Different operation sequences for 
construction are shown in Fig. 5.5.

5.4 
Geosynthetic Overlaps
5.4.1	
When geosynthetic material is used the overlaps can be used to provide continuity 
between adjacent geosynthetic rolls through frictional resistance between the overlaps. Also, 
a sufficient overlap is required to prevent soil from squeezing into the aggregate at the joint. 
The amount and type of overlap depends primarily on the soil conditions, type of geosynthetics 
their function and application. If the subgrade does not rut under construction activities, only 
a minimum overlap is required to provide some pull-out resistance. As the potential for rutting 
and squeezing of soil increases, the required overlap increases. Since rutting potential can be 
related to CBR, it can be used as a guideline for the minimum overlap required.

overlap requirements are given in Fig. 5.6. For underwater applications, 5 mm dia and 450 mm 
long steel pins should be placed at a maximum of 1.0 m centre-to-centre.

5.4.3	
Since manufactured rolls of geocomposite drainage materials must cover large areas, 
field constructed connections along their sides and ends are necessary. This guide addresses 
such connections. Even further, the ends of the geocomposite must eventually terminate by 
attachment to pipes, sumps or swales. These are also made in the field by construction personnel. 
The following situations are presented in this section illustrating various connections.
Connection of Overlapping Geocomposite on their ends and sides: Fig. 5.7 shows an overlapped 
geocomposite with the up-gradient end overlapping the down gradient end. For the sides of the 
rolls which is placed, upper or lower, is not important. The recommended lengths of overlap (“L”) 
are 300-450 mm for ends and 100-150 mm for sides. One other consideration has to do with the

roll ends being factory supplied or cut in the field. The manufacturers of geocomposite usually 
leave an excess of 300 mm of un-bonded geotextile for complete coverage purposes. Field cut 
geocomposite have no such excess geotextile.

Geocomposite to Horizontal Pipe Connection: Geocomposite drainage core should wrap 
around the entire pipe with no intervening geotextile in the flow transfer area (Fig. 5.8a) The 
geocomposites upper geotextile must be stripped off the drainage core, greatly trimmed, and 
then bonded to the reverse side of the geocomposite with its geotextile intact after wrapping 
around the pipe. The overlap distance “L” should be approximately three times the encapsulated 
drainage pipe diameter. Also note that plastic electrical ties are necessary to hold the geonet 
together particularly for thick bi-planar and all tri-planar geonet composites. Generally, two ties 
are necessary to minimize the air space around the encapsulated pipe. This same detail can 
also be followed if the drainage pipe is located in a trench at a lower elevation than the exiting 
geocomposite drain; see Fig. 5.8b.

Seams
5.5.1	
When seams are required for separation applications using geotextile, there should be 
minimum of 90 per cent of the material’s tensile strength requirements of survivability (Table 5.1). 
All factory or field seams should be sewn with thread as strong and durable as the material in the

fabric.
5.5.2	
When field-sewing geotextiles, a number of details must be addressed. They are:
Thread type:	
The choices are polyester, polypropylene and polyamides. Consideration 
should be given to using the same thread type as geotextile fibre.
Thread tension:	
This is usually adjusted in the field so as to be sufficiently tight without 
cutting the geotextiles.
Stitch density:	
Two, three or four stitches per 25 mm are customary.
Stitch type: 	
The choices are prayer, J-type, or butterfly. Fig. 5.9 shows typical seams for 
geotextiles. The strongest being the butterfly type.
Number of rows:	 One, two or three are customary; generally two are recommended.

5.6 
Construction Guidelines for Erosion Control
5.6.1	
The geosynthetic shall be placed in intimate contact with the soils under slight tension, 
without wrinkles or folds and anchored on a smooth graded surface approved by the Engineer. 
The geosynthetic shall be placed in such a manner that placement of the overlying materials will 
not excessively stretch so as to tear the geosynthetic. Using geotextiles, geomats, biodegradable 
mats anchoring of the terminal ends shall be accomplished through the use of key trenches or 
aprons at the crest and toe of slope.
The following anchoring recommendations are provided as a guide and needs to be adjusted 
based on specific site conditions and manufacturer’s instructions.
Anchoring the edges of the erosion control mat in a trench approximately 150-200 mm deep by 
150 mm wide prevents water flowing under the mat and provides maximum erosion protection. 
When installing mat down a slope, it is recommended, the upstream edge is anchored in a trench 
to provide better protection from stream flow. Mat should have good contact with the soil surface 
and be secured with an appropriate number of pins for degree of slope. As a general rule, mat 
should be secured with pins at 0.5-1 m intervals along the length of the mat and staggering 
pins 400-600 mm across the mat. Pins should be driven flush with the soil surface and be long 
enough to ensure sufficient ground penetration to resist pullout. If the degree of slope is greater 
than 1V:3H it is recommended the anchor trench be installed at least 1 m from the crest of the 
slope.

The geosynthetic shall be placed with the machine direction parallel to the direction of 
water flow which is normally parallel to the slope for erosion control runoff and wave action and 
parallel to the stream or channel in the case of stream bank and channel protection. Adjacent 
geosynthetic sheets shall be joined by either sewing or overlapping or joining. Overlap at roll 
ends and at adjacent sheets shall be minimum of 300 mm, except when placed under water. In 
such instances, the overlap shall be minimum of 1 m.

63
5.6.3	
In cases where wave action or multi-directional flow is anticipated, all seams 
perpendicular to the direction of flow shall be sewn.
5.6.4	
Care shall be taken during installation so as to avoid damage occurring to the 
geosynthetics as a result of the installation process. Should the geosynthetic be damaged 
during installation, a geosynthetic patch shall be placed over the damaged area extending 
1 m beyond the perimeter of the damage.
5.6.5	
The armour system placement shall begin at the toe and proceed up the slope. 
Placement shall take place so as to avoid stretching and subsequent tearing of the geosynthetic. 
Riprap and heavy stone filling shall not be dropped from a height of more than 300 mm. Stone 
with a mass of more than 100 kg shall not be allowed to roll down the slope.
5.6.6	
Slope protection and smaller sizes of stone filling shall not be dropped from a height 
exceeding 1 m, or a field trial should be undertaken to verify that the placement procedures will 
not damage the geosynthetic. In underwater applications, the geosynthetic and backfill material 
shall be placed the same day. All void spaces in the armour stone shall be backfilled with small 
stone to ensure full coverage.
5.6.7	
Following placement of the armour stone, grading of the slope shall not be permitted 
if the grading results in movement of the stone directly above the geosynthetic.
5.6.8	
Field monitoring shall be performed to verify that the armour system placement 
does not damage the geosynthetic. Any geotextile damaged during backfill placement shall be 
replaced as directed by the Engineer-in-charge.
5.7 
Construction Guidelines for Use of Asphalt Reinforcement
5.7.1	
General preparation work prior to paving: The existing pavement must show no 
significant signs of pumping, movement or structural instability. All patches, pothole repairs 
and crack sealing should be done prior to paving. Bituminous reinforcement adheres best to a 
smooth, flat bituminous surface.
5.7.2	
Therefore a bituminous levelling layer may be necessary:
•	
On a coarsely milled or very rough surface 
•	
On a very uneven (rutted) surface
A levelling layer is not normally necessary:
•	
For an overlay on an old surface that is smooth and flat 
•	
On a finely milled surface 
5.7.3	
The surface must be clean and dry before placing the asphalt reinforcement 
•	
Clean for good adhesion
•	
Dry (of moisture) also for adhesion
•	
Dry bitumen (tack or fresh bituminous) to avoid pick-up on construction vehicle tyres 
that may in turn lift the asphalt reinforcement.

Fig. 5.11 Glass Fibre Grid placed on Levelling Layer Prior Paving
5.7.4	
Repair of defects prior to paving: The degree and extent of surfacing defects and 
failures necessitate certain methods of repair to render the road surface serviceable again. 
Bituminous Reinforcement is an alternative to the reworking of pavement layers and usually 
applied before a road surface is resealed or overlaid with bituminous.
5.7.4.1	
Pothole patching: All loose materials of the damaged surfacing and base layers must 
be removed to the full depth and backfilled with approved bituminous mixtures as described in 
various handbooks or as specified. The shape of the repair area should be square or rectangular 
and the surfacing cut 75 to 100 mm wider than the cleaned - out area.
5.7.4.2	
Seal cracks: The repair of seal cracks shall follow the provisions of MoRTH section 
3000.
5.7.5	
Certain types of bituminous reinforcement do not require cracks to be sealed 
beforehand.
5.7.5.1	
Levelling course: When required to remove unacceptable irregularities, bumps or 
slacks, a screed of densely graded bituminous should be placed. It is also possible to remove 
high spots and ridges by planning, in which case it is recommended that the milled surface be 
left rough.
5.7.5.2	
Rut filling: Rut depths of up to 15 mm, or as specified, can be filled with coarse 
slurry. It is recommended that rapid setting slurry be used. Rut depths up to 25 mm can be filled

with hot, densely graded bituminous. Ruts deeper than 25 mm should be removed by surface 
patching methods.
5.7.6	
This work shall consist of lying of geotextile (paving fabric) between two bituminous 
layers as part of pavement strengthening to provide a water resistant membrane and crack 
retarding layer. Fig. 5.9 shows layer arrangement for using paving fabric. It is recommended that 
paving fabric should be used over the entire pavement area affected by cracking and not in the 
form of strips over the pavement cracks.
5.7.7	
On existing cement concrete pavements, a layer of DBM/Bituminous Concrete should 
be provided before laying the paving fabric.
5.7.8	
The tack coat used to impregnate the fabric and bond the fabric to the pavement shall 
be as per the provisions of Section 503 of MoRTH.
5.7.9	
Minimum air and pavement temperature shall be at least 10°C or more for placement 
of tack coat. Neither tack coat nor paving fabric shall be placed when weather conditions, in the 
opinion of the Engineer, are not suitable.
5.7.10	
The pavement surface shall be thoroughly cleaned of all dirt, water and oil to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer. Cracks wider than 3 mm shall be cleaned and filled with suitable 
bituminous material by a method approved by the Engineer. Crack filling material shall be allowed 
to cure prior to application of tack coat. Potholes and other pavement distress shall be repaired. 
Repairs shall be performed as directed by the Engineer. A profile correction course shall be laid, 
wherever required, before placing the paving fabric.
5.7.11	
The tack coat shall be sprayed preferably by means of a calibrated distributor spray 
bar. Hand spraying and brush application may be used in locations of fabric overlap. Every effort 
shall be made to keep hand spraying to a minimum. The tack coat shall be applied uniformly to 
the prepared dry pavement surface at the rate governed by the following equation:
	
Qd = 0.36 + Qs + Qc
Where,
Qd = Design tack coat quantity
Qs = Saturation content of the geotextile being used (kg/m2) to be provided by the manufacturer
Qc = Correction based on tack coat demand of the existing pavement surface (kg/m2)
Table 5.2 gives typical values of tack coat demand of existing bituminous pavement surfaces. 
Within street intersections, on steep grades or in other zones where vehicle speed changes, the 
normal application rate shall be reduced by about 20 per cent or as directed by the Engineer.

5.7.12	
The temperature of the tack coat shall be sufficiently high (140°C) to permit a 
uniform spray pattern. To avoid damage to the fabric, distributor tank temperature shall not 
exceed 160°C.
5.7.13	
The target width of tack coat application shall be equal to the paving fabric width 
application plus 150 mm. The tack coat shall be applied only as far in advance of paving fabric 
installation as is appropriate to ensure a tacky surface at the time of paving fabric placement. 
Traffic shall not be allowed on the tack coat. Any spillage or excess tack coat should either be 
removed or sand be sprayed over it.
5.7.14	
Paving fabric shall be placed on a dry surface. In case it rains after installing the 
paving fabric, but before placing the overlay over it, all excess water should be removed and the 
fabric should be allowed to dry up sufficiently before placing the overlay.
5.7.15	
The paving fabric shall be placed with heat set side facing up, onto the tack coat 
using mechanical or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation 
with a minimum amount of wrinkling or folding. The paving fabric shall be placed prior to 
the tack coat cooling and losing tackiness. Paving fabric shall not be installed in areas 
where the overlay bituminous layer tapers to a thickness of less than 40 mm. Excess 
paving fabric, which extends beyond the edge of existing pavement or areas of tack coat 
applications shall be trimmed and removed. Wrinkles or folds in excess of 25 mm shall be 
slit and laid flat. Brooming and/or pneumatic rolling will be required to maximize paving 
fabric contact with the pavement surface. All areas with paving fabrics placed will be paved 
the same day. No traffic except necessary construction equipment will be allowed to drive 
on the paving fabric. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to satisfy 
saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure of the 
joint but not exceed 150 mm. Overlaps of adjacent rolls shall be staggered by a minimum 
of one meter.
5.7.16	
After laying the paving fabric, some loose bituminous concrete should be sprinkled on 
it in the wheel path of the paver and the tipper to ensure that the fabric is not picked up between 
the wheels.
5.7.17	
Turning of the paver and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum 
to avoid movement and damage to the paving fabric. Abrupt starts and stops shall also be 
avoided. Damaged fabric shall be removed and replaced with the same type of fabric.
5.7.18	
Bituminous overlay construction shall closely follow fabric placement. All areas in 
which paving fabric has been placed will be paved the same day. Excess bitumen, which bleeds 
through the paving fabric, shall be removed by spreading hot mix or sand on the paving fabric. 
The hot mix should be placed between a temperature range of 130°C to 145°C so as to given 
enough heat to the bitumen in the tack coat to rise up into the fabric.
5.7.19	
The introduction of paving fabrics have been reported to reduce the required design 
overlay thickness. However, these guidelines do not recommend any reduction in design overlay 
thickness; rather its introduction is to enhance the performance of the pavement.
In general, installation of geotextiles as pavement fabric shall follow IS 16343.

CHAPTER - 6 
HANDLING AND STORAGE OF GEOSYNTHETICS
6.1	
General
6.1.1	
Geosynthetics are durable products, which provide cost-effective solutions to a variety 
of civil engineering design/construction related problems. As with any construction material, 
geosynthetics must be handled and stored properly to ensure that the specified physical properties 
are retained to serve project needs. The damages caused on this account can significantly 
reduce the geosynthetic ability to perform its intended function in some applications.
The objective of geosynthetic handling and storage is to safely transport and store the geosynthetic 
rolls or panels at the project site without damaging the geosynthetic or unduly exposing it to 
sunlight (ultraviolet light), moisture or other contamination. The following are some of the general 
recommendations to be followed while working with geosynthetic materials at site. Handling and 
storage of geosynthetics can be as per product manufacturer’s suggestions and instructions.
6.2	
Site Unloading
6.2.1	
A fork-lift or front-end loader fitted with a long, tapered pole is recommended for 
unloading of geosynthetic rolls. The pole, shown in Fig. 6.1, is often referred to as a ‘carpet 
pole’ or ‘stinger’. The carpet pole is inserted into the geosynthetic roll core and the roll is lifted 
off the truck bed. The pole should be long enough to extend at least two third of the way into the 
geosynthetic roll core to avoid the possibility of breaking or damaging the roll core.
 
Fig. 6.1 Hydro Crane Shifting the Geosynthetic Roll to the Location
6.2.2	
Geosynthetic rolls may also be lifted from flatbed trailers using nylon straps or rope 
and a crane, backhoe, or bulldozer. Not more than three geosynthetic rolls should be lifted at a 
time. Exceeding this number may cause damage to the roll core and hamper while geosynthetic 
deployment. Chains and cables should not be used to lift geosynthetic rolls. The equipment 
recommended to unload geosynthetic rolls may not be always available at construction sites. In 
such cases, unloading and handling is invariably done by other locally available methods or with 
labours. If unloaded with care, the geosynthetic will remain suitable for easy laying. A roll puller, 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
68
nylon strap, or rope can be used to unload geosynthetic rolls from an enclosed trailer if a carpet 
pole is not available. Roll pullers are devices, which are inserted into the roll core and attached 
via a chain or strap to a loader, bulldozer, or other vehicle as shown in Fig. 6.2. As the vehicle 
pulls, the roll puller expands against the inside of the roll core and drags the roll to the edge 
of the truck bed and down to the ground surface. Nylon straps or ropes may also be wrapped 
around the geosynthetic roll using a slip knot. Again the roll is dragged to the edge of the truck 
and down to the ground surface. A tarpaulin, sheet of plastic or fabric should be placed on the 
ground where the geosynthetic rolls are to be unloaded.

Fig. 6.3a & b Geocell Panels and Geogrid Rolls Readied for Placement
6.3	
Site Handling
Rolls of geosynthetic should always be lifted off the ground surface prior to moving. Dragging the 
geosynthetic and operating equipment on the geosynthetic, which results in physical damage, 
should be avoided at all times. Geocell panels are packed in a collapsed form [Fig. 6.4].

6.4	
Site Storage
6.4.1	
The geosynthetic rolls should be adequately protected from ultraviolet light exposure 
during storage at site. A protective wrapping should be kept on rolls until the geosynthetics are 
installed. If stored outside, the geosynthetic should be elevated from the ground surface and 
adequately covered to protect them from the following; site construction damage, precipitation, 
ultraviolet radiation including sun light, chemicals that are strong acid/bases, flames including 
welding sparks, temperature in excess of 71°C and any other environmental condition that may 
damage the geosynthetic. Fig. 6.5 illustrates the mode of covering of geotextile before use at 
site.
Fig. 6.5 Covering of Geosynthetic Rolls before Use at Site
To the extent possible, geocells shall be stored with the packaging intact. This is essential for the 
following reasons:
a)	
Easy identification of the material type, batch no. and other details;
b)	
Protection against any damage during storage;
c)	
Protection against damage during onward handling

6.4.2	
Steps to be taken if geosynthetic roll or protective wrapping is damaged
6.4.2.1	
In most cases, damage to a roll of geosynthetics is limited to the protective wrapping. 
If the wrapping is damaged, proper storage of the geosynthetic is particularly critical. The rolls 
must be elevated off the ground surface and securely covered with a tarpaulin or opaque plastic 
sheet. If the outer layer of the geosynthetic itself is damaged, it is necessary during installations 
to remove the outermost wraps of the roll and discard the damaged material. The remaining 
undamaged material is suitable for use. Removing the outermost wrap of geosynthetic is called for 
when a roll is exposed to sunlight for a period beyond that permitted by the project specifications. 
The remaining unexposed material is suitable for construction.
6.4.2.2	
Exposing geosynthetic rolls to moisture or water prior to installation can lead to serious 
handling problems. Non-woven geosynthetics in particular can absorb water up to three times 
their weight. In addition, the cores on which the geosynthetic rolls are wound are manufactured 
from laminated paper. When wet, the strength of these cores is seriously diminished to the point 
where the core will not support the weight of the geosynthetic. Consequently, it can be extremely 
difficult to install wet rolls of geosynthetic. In addition, it is nearly impossible to unroll wet, frozen 
geosynthetic without first allowing it to thaw.
6.4.3	
Steps to be taken if geosynthetic rolls become wet
If geosynthetic rolls become wet, it is permissible to remove the waterproof cover to allow for a 
few days of exposure to wind in order to dry the geosynthetic material. It is essential that the rolls 
be elevated during the process. It is also permissible to remove the protective wrapping from one 
end of the roll and elevate the opposite end of the roll. Then the majority of excess water will flow 
out of the geosynthetic. In most cases, these procedures will not allow the geosynthetic material 
to dry completely. Once unrolled during installation, the geosynthetic will dry very quickly in the 
sun and wind. However, it should be noted that non-woven geosynthetics used in conjunction 
with asphalt overlays of existing pavements must be completely dry prior to installation.

6.4.4	
Protection from sunlight (ultraviolet light) degradation
6.4.4.1	
Geosynthetic materials slowly degrade in the presence of ultraviolet light. Though some 
geosynthetics contain ultraviolet stabilizing chemicals to keep this degradation to a minimum, 
it is advisable to limit geosynthetic exposure to sunlight until just before installation. Acceptable 
limits of exposure to ultraviolet light depend upon site environmental conditions (temperature, 
latitude, time of year, wind, etc.) and the assumptions used by the Engineer during design.
6.4.4.2	
The geosynthetic material should always be installed within the period required by 
the project specifications. If no time requirements are specified, it is generally recommended 
that geosynthetic exposure to ultraviolet light be limited to a period of approximately two weeks. 
Excessive cold temperatures normally found at construction sites, even in the coldest climates, 
do not pose a threat to geosynthetics.

Annexure I
Determination of Layer coefficients
Layer coefficients are empirical relationships between Structural Number (SN) and layer 
thicknesses which expresses the relative ability of a material to function as a structural component 
of the pavement. They are typically determined empirically based on the performance of the 
material. Clear information on determining of the layer coefficients are provided in 2.3.5 of Part 
II, AASHTO 1993. Determination of layer coefficients from FWD and CBR values shall be as 
follows:
Determination of layer coefficient from FWD data (Layer coefficients for NHDOT pavement 
materials, Vincent - C. Janoo - 1994)
Rohde (1994) developed a method for determining the SN of a pavement structure using the 
FWD measurements. The SN equation used is the one modified by TRL in 1975 and used in 
the World Bank Highway Design and Maintenance Pavement Performance Model (HDM-111 
model). The modified Structural Number (SNC) is defined as 
           ∑  
 
   
        
Where, SNSG is that portion of the structural number contributed by the subgrade. The following 
relationship for SNSG in terms of CBR has been used:
SNSG = 3.51 log10 CBR – 0.85 (log10 CBR)2 – 1.43
Where CBR = in-situ California Bearing Ratio of the subgrade (%)
Based on Irwin’s (1983), “ two thirds rule” of stress distribution under pavement structure, Rohde 
assumed that the deflection (D1.5h) measured at a distance on the surface equal to 1.5 times the 
structural section thickness (h) is due to the subgrade only. He then developed the Structural 
Index of the Pavement (SIP). SIP is associated with the deflection above the subgrade only:
SIP=D0-D1.5h
The hypothesis is that SIP should be strongly correlated with stiffness of the pavement structure 
and thus to SN. Based on the regression analysis, Rohde developed a relationship between SN 
and SIP:
SN = k1 SIPk2 hk3
The following values, 0.1165, -0.3248 and 0.8241 were used for K1, K2 and K3 (Reclaimed 
Stabilized Base layers (RSB) at 2%, 3% and 4%) for all the base courses with the exception of 
the asphalt layer. For the asphalt layer, 0.4728, -0.4810 and 0.7581 were used as recommended 
by Rohde, respectively. For a two-layer system, the layer coefficient was calculated using
           
         



======================================================================
PAGE 81 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
73
He developed another index called Structural Index of Subgrade (SIS):
SIS=D1.5h-Ds
Where Ds is the deflection measured at a distance of 762 mm from the center plate. The subgrade 
modulus is
Esg = 10k4 SISk5 hk6
The following recommended values of 23138, -1.236 and -1.903 (Rohde 1994) were used for k4, 
k5 and k6. The CBR% of the subgrade was back calculated from
Esg = [1500 × CBR0.73] / 6.9, (kPa)
The subgrade moduli obtained from the modified Boussinesq equation were also used in place 
of Esg and layer coefficient can be back calculated.
Determination of layer coefficients using CBR results
Field CBR data were obtained from the Clegg hammer and in-situ CBR testing. Dynamic Cone 
Penetrometer (DCP) data also can be converted to CBR. The DCP data are converted to 
penetration per blow rate. The Corps of Engineers use the following relationship to convert the 
DCP rate to CBR:
       
   
        
where DCP = millimetres/blow
The World Bank Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM-111) pavement performance model, 
provided a correlation between CBR and ai as given below
ai = (29.14 × CBR – 0.1977 CBR2 + 0.00045 CBR3) 10-4

Annexure II
Development of the Layer Coefficient Ratio &  
Modulus Improvement Factor
1 
Layer Coefficient Ratio
General
Layer Coefficient Ratio (LCR) represents impact provided by a specific geogrid to the layer coefficient 
of the layer in which the geogrid is placed. The LCR approach applies and limits the geosynthetic 
benefit derived from trials to the specific layer improved by inclusion of reinforcement (granular 
layers). Using the LCR approach, a designer may quantify the benefits of geogrid reinforcement 
either through increased pavement life or reduced layer thickness or a combination of both.
Typical LCR determination procedure through full scale traffic tests and laboratory tests on 
geogrid reinforced and unreinforced flexible pavements are as follows:
1.1 
Full Scale Traffic Tests
1.1.1	
Test section layout and design
The full scale traffic tests shall be performed outdoors and subject to local environmental 
conditions just as any other road or pavement with the following features:
•	
Full scale highway construction equipment and practices
•	
Extended exposure to weather over multiple seasons
•	
Incorporation of local subgrade soils, aggregate and paving material
•	
A driven traffic vehicle capable of applying 80 kN standard axle loads to eliminate the 
steering axle effect; “super-single” tires
•	
Channelized traffic with minimal wander
•	
Laser profiling of the rutting pattern
The test tracks are usually laid out as an oval as shown in Fig. II-1, to provide a one-directional 
wheel loading pattern during continuous traffic. Straight sections used for testing should be 
sufficiently long to accommodate multiple, full lane width test sections. A typical test cross section 
accommodating two wheel paths is shown in Fig. II-2.

Fig. II-2 Typical Cross Section of Test Area
Test sections shall be constructed in groups having different target subgrade CBR values 
indicating different subgrade strength. All test sections shall be designed to reach at least 25 
mm of permanent centreline deflection before reaching target traffic load in terms of Equivalent 
Single Axle Loads (ESALs). All sections shall be subjected to identical compactive effort on all 
the surface, base and subbase layers. Fig. II-3 illustrates construction of a typical set of test 
sections.
Fig. II-3 Construction of Typical Test Sections
In order to maintain realistic conditions, pavement sections shall be prepared with standard local 
pavement materials (BC, DBM, WMM, GSB, and subgrade soils). High quality control standards 
and a rigorous quality assurance regimen must be applied to the construction process. Measured 
as-constructed section properties for several tests shall be taken note. 
1.1.2	
Traffic
A commercial truck may be modified for use as the loading vehicle for test sections. Modifications 
include adding carefully distributed weight to the vehicle such that each axle applied a load of 
80-kN. In addition, all tires with tyre pressure of 0.56 MPa should be used during testing. The 
tires shall be aligned from front to rear such that each travelled in the same path when the 
vehicle is driving straight. 



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:59-2019
76
These modifications ensure that each passage of the loading vehicle applies two identical loads 
to the test sections thereby negating the complicating effects of a steering/load axle combination 
often associated with full scale testing. A loading vehicle used for traffic is shown in Fig. II-4. The 
truck shall be made to run along the test sections for a predetermined number of passes before 
stopping for surface rut depth measurements.
Wheel path centreline and transverse profile rut data shall be collected at the centre point of 
each test section using a stiff beam placed on the measurement posts which is shown in Fig. 
II-4. A laser distance measuring device, accurate to one mm, shall be placed at predetermined 
points along the measurement beam to gather these measurements as illustrated in Figs. 
II-4 and II-5. A full transverse surface profile shall be collected on each test section before 
allowing traffic and at various intervals during traffic. Centreline deflection data are collected 
more frequently to assess ongoing deformation.
FWD (Falling Weight Deflectometer) technique can be used to evaluate the layer moduli of 
pavement test sections. This FWD deflection data from unreinforced and reinforced pavement 
sections shall be used to analyse the pavement for critical strains which are indicators of pavement 
performance in terms of rutting and fatigue cracking. Difference in modulus values obtained from 
FWD test data may be used to determine improvement by using geogrid in pavement layers.
Fig. II-4 Loading Vehicle and Beam for Surface Rut Measurements during Traffic

Traffic is applied to the test sections until each of the individual test paved sections reaches 25 
mm of permanent centreline deflection before reaching target traffic load in terms of Equivalent 
Single Axle Loads (ESALs).

77
Test sections that fail early are repaired to maintain traffic ability of the vehicle and limit carryover 
damage to adjacent test sections. This repair is accomplished by adding extra base course 
aggregate in the rutted areas and smoothing the area out with a light weight skid steer loader.
Standard axle passages for each test section to reach predetermined levels of permanent 
deformation are determined, followed by application of a normalization procedure to the data, 
which is required to eliminate the section to section variability in full scale, realistic test sections. 
All values are interpolated using a best fit line of data near the 25 mm threshold.
1.2 
Laboratory Tests
Large scale experimental program in lab can be conducted to evaluate and understand 
the structural contribution of geogrid to flexible pavement systems under simulated traffic 
conditions. Geogrid shall be placed in one half of the box section, while the other half may 
be left unreinforced to be used as control section for comparison. Geogrid shall be placed in 
flat prepared bed as per the requirements and then folded at 90° at the box sides. Geogrid 
is folded to metal box sides to model the anchorage effect in a typical wide road base. Load 
in the form of sinusoidal cycles shall be applied through circular loading plate having 300 
mm diameter. Loading may range from 0 to 40kN with an equivalent applied pressure of 
560kPa. Vertical settlements (ruts) have to be recorded as a function of number of cycles 
together with the permanent deformation in the road section. Test sections may be constructed 
and loaded in either a test-box facility or a facility allowing for the construction of a test-track. 
Minimum dimensions for the geometry of a test-box are given in Fig. II-6.

Settlements and elastic rebounds of the asphalt layers shall also be measured during the tests, 
under the loading plate for every 100 cycles but not limited to, interval may be chosen based on 
the requirements. Distribution of the permanent deformation on the aggregate during the tests 
determined by measuring the displacements of the asphalt surface in several locations, and

of tests should be done with several subgrade shear strengths with different CBR values for 
different densities. Rut geometry for reinforced and unreinforced sections shall be analyzed to 
determine differences in depth and shape of the deformed sections.

pavement system with and without reinforcement.

Modulus Improvement Factor for Geogrid and Geocell
Modulus of the system with or without geosynthetic material is essentially the slope of the stress 
versus strain curve. The Modulus Improvement Factor (MIF) is the ratio of improvement of the 
modulus of a system where geosynthetic materials are incorporated, as compared to the system 
without geosynthetic materials. This factor is evaluated by conducting plate load tests on soil 
subgrade and evaluating the respective moduli without and with geosynthetic materials and 
comparing the two moduli to estimate the MIF.
Determination of MIF for Geocell
Two sections, viz. unreinforced section and geosynthetic reinforced section are considered for 
analysis. Schematics of both sections are shown in Fig. II-7 below. Strain gauges are placed 
in position to monitor deformations. Earth pressure cells are placed in position below the 
geosynthetic materials to monitor pressures. This is highlighted in the section view in Fig. II-7.

For future enhancement of the design procedure, Research has started focus on Mechanistic-
Empirical (ME) design procedures—specifically, how to incorporate the AASHTO Mechanical-
Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) procedures (AASHTO 2008). Discrete element 
modelling of geogrid and aggregate, mechanistic response modelling with finite element method 
analyses, full scale testing, and laboratory testing are being employed to develop/refine an M-E 
design procedure.
MIF for geogrid can also be determined in the similar procedure.

Worked-out Examples Illustrating the Design Methods
Example 1: Design the Pavement for Construction of a New Flexible Pavement with the 
following Data:
Input data:
Design traffic: 50 msa
Subgrade CBR = 6%
Solution:
i.	
Design resilient modulus of the compacted subgrade
	
MR (MPa) 	
= 10 × CBR	 	
; for CBR 5
	
	
	
	
= 17.6 × (CBR)0.64	
; for CBR > 5
	
Where MR = Resilient modulus of subgrade soil
	
MR subgrade	
=17.6 × 60.64= 55.4 MPa
ii.	
Thickness of unreinforced granular layers: For design traffic of 50 msa and obtained 
CBR of 6 per cent, the thickness values are taken as below with reference to design plates 
(Assume Plate 4) from IRC:37.
	
Thickness of granular base (D2) = 250 mm,
	
Thickness of granular sub-base (D3) = 260 mm
MR_G=0.2×h0.45×MR_subgrade
	
Where h= thickness of granular base and sub-base layers, mm
	
Therefore, resilient modulus of granular layer = 0.2 × (510)0.45 × 55.4= 183.20 MPa.
Thickness of proposed bituminous layer with VG 40 bitumen with bottom DBM layer having air 
void of 3 per cent (0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent additional bitumen over OBC) over WMM and 
GSB mm at reliability of 90 per cent.
(A) 
Design calculations of bitumen pavement with geogrid reinforced granular 
base and subbase layers using LCR of geogrid
 
Reducing thickness of pavement section
In this case the effect of reinforcement is shown as the reduction in the pavement section 
thickness.
	
i.	
Design Traffic = 50 msa
	
ii.	
Subgrade CBR = 6 per cent

MR_GSB = 0.2×h0.45×MR_subgrade
	
	
Where h= thickness of granular sub-base layer, mm
	
	
MR of unreinforced subbase layer = 0.2 × (260)0.45 × 55.4 = 136 MPa = 19724.624 Psi
	
	
Granular Base thickness = 250 mm
MR_GB = 0.2×h0.45 × MR_GSB
	
	
Where h = thickness of granular base layer, mm
	
	
MR of unreinforced base layer = 0.2 × (250)0.45 × 136 = 327MPa = 47426.118Psi
	
	
Resilient modulus of Bituminous Mixes = 3000 MPa=435102 Psi 
	
v.	
Structural layer coefficient of each layer:
	
	
Layer coefficient for bituminous layer (a1) = 0.171 x (LN (MR))-1.784
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
 = 0.171 x (LN (435102))-1.784=0.436
	
a)	
Structural Layer coefficient for base layer shall be taken from the equations 
given in AASTHO 1993.
	
	
Structural layer coefficient for base layer 
	
	
a2 = 0.249 × (log10 MR_BC) – 0.977 = 0.249 × (log10 47426.118) – 0.977 = 
0.188
	
b)	
Structural layer coefficient for subbase layer
	
	
a3 = 0.227 (log10MR_SB) – 0.839 = 0.227 × (log1019724.624) – 0.839 
= 0.136
	
	
Therefore,
	
	
Layer coefficient for base layer (a2)	
	
= 0.188
	
	
Layer coefficient for sub base layer (a3)		
= 0.136

laboratory tests/filed tests; or it can be provided by the manufacturer.

Granular sub-base thickness = 180 mm
MR_GSB = 0.2×h0.45 × MR_subgrade
	
	
	
Where h= thickness of granular sub-base layer, mm
	
	
	
MR of reinforced subbase layer = 0.2 × (180)0.45 × 55.40 = 115 MPa = 
16678.91Psi
	
	
	
Granular Base thickness = 160 mm
MR_GB = 0.2 × h0.45 × MR_GSB
	
	
	
Where h = thickness of granular base layer, mm
	
	
	
MR of reinforced base layer = 0.2 × (160)0.45 × 115 = 225 MPa 
= 32632.65 Psi
	
	
	
Layer coefficient for bituminous layer (a1) = 0.436

c)	
Structural Layer coefficient for base layer shall be taken from b equations 
given in AASTHO 1993.
	
	
Structural layer coefficient for base layer 
	
	
a2 = 0.249 × (log10MR_GB) – 0.977 = 0.249 × (log10 32632.65) – 0.977 
= 0.147
	
d)	
Structural layer coefficient for subbase layer
	
	
a3 = 0.227 (log10MR_GSB) – 0.839 = 0.227 × (log10 16678.91) – 0.839 
= 0.120
	
	
Therefore,
	
	
Modified Layer coefficient for base layer (a2) = 0.147
	
	
Modified Layer coefficient for sub base layer (a3) = 0.120
	
	
Modified layer coefficient for base layer (a2’) = LCRbase × a2
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
= 1.4*0.147= 0.2058
	
	
Modified layer coefficient for sub-base layer (a3’) = LCRSubbase × a3
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
= 1.61*0.120= 0.1932
With the improved layer coefficients, improved elastic modulus of respective layers shall be back 
calculated using below equations.

This reinforced pavement section shall be designed as per IRC:37 i.e. section shall be checked 
for fatigue and rutting failure criterion by inputting this improved elastic modulus into IITPAVE. 
Fig. IV-4, shows the input parameters in IITPAVE, in which improved E values are used. Fig. IV-5 
represents the vertical and tensile strains induced in the pavement layers. Obtained vertical 
strain at subgrade level is 360.4×10-6 which is less than the permissible vertical strain 372×10-
6 obtained as per Eq 6.5 in IRC:37 and obtained tensile strain at bottom of bitumen layer is 
146.7×10-6 is less than permissible 155×10-6 tensile strain obtained as per Eq 6.2 of IRC:37. 
Hence the reduced section with geogrid reinforcement in base and subbase layers is acceptable 
for design traffic 50 msa.

Example 2: Design Example for Flexible Pavement using Geocell
Consider a pavement to be constructed on marine clay with a CBR of 2%. The design life of the 
structure, reflected as million standard axles (msa), as 100 msa.
Solution:
As a matter of good practice and as per IRC:37 Clause 5.1, it would be prudent to provide a 
500 mm thick layer of select earth over the dressed clay surface. With the soft marine clay 
below, the CBR of the earth fill may not be considered greater than 3%, which is also the lowest 
CBR considered by IRC:37. On the basis of the Plate shown in Fig. IV-6, the section of the 
conventional pavement for 100 msa traffic is as per Fig. IV-7.

In Fig. IV-7, it may be noted that nonwoven geotextile is provided at the interface between the 
marine clay and the select earth fill as a separation layer.

               (

                     (  
  
)
      
 
	
	
	
εv = 319.0 × 10-6 micro-strain units.



======================================================================

               (

)
    
 (
 
    )
     
 
	
	
	
εt = 129.94 × 10-6 micro-strain units.
Hence for the recommended conventional pavement section, permissible vertical subgrade 
strain and horizontal tensile strain are 319.0×10-6 and 129.94×10-6 respectively.
These values will form the basis of checking the reduced thicknesses of pavement components 
with the introduction of geocells within the appropriate pavement layer. For the reduced section 
with geocells, the strains should be equal to or less than those for the conventional section at the 
corresponding locations. These criteria must be satisfied for the various options using geocells 
as discussed below.
The Geocell Options
The geocell panels are placed within either Granular Base layer or Granular Sub-base layer. 
Modulus of the portion of the layer within which the geocells are placed is increased by a Modulus 
Improvement Factor. With the geocell layer in place, thickness of the costliest layer may be first 
selected for reduction.
Computations are repeated with IITPAVE with the appropriate moduli values. Varying the 
thicknesses by trial and error, two sections were arrived at as shown in the Fig. IV-8. These 
were compared separately with the conventional section.
Option-1: Geocell placed within  
GSB and overall thickness of GSB reduced to  
200 mm and DBM reduced to 140 mm
Option-2: Geocell placed within  
Granular Base and overall thickness of Granular Base 
reduced to 200 mm and GSB reduced to 250 mm
Fig. IV-8 Design Sections using Geocells
Note:
1.	
In all cases, Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC) thickness has been retained as 50 mm.
2.	
If DBM is maintained at 50 mm, the strains exceed those for Conventional Section.

Vertical strain at the interface with the subgrade is 309.1 x 10-6 micro-strain units. The 
corresponding strain for the Conventional Section is 100.7 x 10-6 micro-strain units. Hence the 
thinner section with geocells is acceptable. Furthermore, considering the rutting model the as 
per IRC:37, the number of standard axles over the pavement with the new moduli with geocells 
works out to 115 msa with 90% reliability.
In the similar way, geocell placed in granular base shall be computed.
