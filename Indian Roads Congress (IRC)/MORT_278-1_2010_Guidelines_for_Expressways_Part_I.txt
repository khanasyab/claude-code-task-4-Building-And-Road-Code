FOREWORD
Government of India has taken a mission to develop a National Expressway Network
dedicated to provide road infrastructure comparable to the world standards, recognizing
the importance of providing high-speed facilities connecting ports, major cities, industrial/
agricultural centers and major markets to the significant economic growth. Construction
of fully access controlled expressways for 1000 km under National Highways Development
Program (NHDP) Phase VI are about to be launched.
Accountability for providing safe, reliable and user comfortable road network utimately
rests with the Government. It is, therefore, essential that the Guidelines for Expressways
laid down for development of expressways should cover sound engineering practices,
safety features and amenities for the users.
Ministry took up the preparation of the Guidelines for Expressways through technical
cooperation from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and constituted a
Technical Committee comprising of the following officers for its finilization:
1
Sh. Nirmal Jit Singh, Director General (Road Development) and
Chairman
Special Secretary, MORTH

The Guidelines for Expressways, as prepared, highlights appropriate planning and design
principles for promoting safety conscious planning and design and will go a long way in
guiding the highway engineers and planners to make our expressways safer, comfortable
and of international standards.
Guidelines have been structured in four (4) volumes :
Volume - I
:
Planning
Volume - II
:
Design
Volume - III
:
Operations and Management
Volume - IV
:
Maintenance
The intended users of this guideline will be the transportation professionals/engineers
who participate in or are responsible for any phase in the project preparation of the
Expressway Project. This includes all public or private “practitioners” (e.g. managers,
supervisors, engineers, planners, or technicians) who are involved with any issue or
decision (e.g. managers, supervisors, engineers, planners, or technicians) who are involved
with any issue or decision (e.g. legislation, policy, program, funding, operation &
management and maintenance scenario) that may directly or indirectly infuence the
performance of an Expressway facility.
In planning design process, the Highway Engineer strives to develop, within the limits of
given constraints, the dimensional layout or geometric configuration that will lead to high
level of safety, efficiency and ease in driving. Therefore, the intent of this document is to
provide guidance to the designer with the critical aspects of project preparation for an
expressway. This guideline is dynamic in nature and the users, based on their experience,
give appropriate feedback so as to enable the Guidelines to be revised/improved from
time to time.

VOLUME – I : PLANNING
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
The Document Volume-I: Planning, is complementary to other guideline volumes. The objective
of this document is to assist the expressway professionals/engineers with the basic
requirements in project preparation for the identified sections of “National Expressway Network”.
IRC:SP:19-2001 “Manual for Survey, Investigations and Preparation of Road Project” may
be treated as a base document along with its limitations for use under the present context.
This Volume-I: Planning document intends to provide comprehensive information on project
preparation under commercial format (PPP – BOT, BOOT, DBFO etc.)
The contents of this document are necessarily a compilation on illustrative requirements
which are generally not covered comprehensively by the available documents/practices.
This document has been structured into 4 (four) chapters as follows:
Chapter – 1
:
Survey, Investigation and Preparation of the Project
Chapter – 2
:
Route Planning
Chapter – 3
:
Economic and Financial Viability Analysis
Chapter – 4
:
Expressway Capacity
Chapter – 1
:
Survey, Investigations and Preparation of the Project
This chapter provides broad stages in project preparation involving basic data assembly,
socio-economic profile, environmental impact study and resettlement & rehabilitation action
plan and soil material investigations.
Stages in project preparation inter-alia include knowledge of legislative policies and various
requirements, such as, PPPAC for implementation under Public Private Partnership (PPP).
For details the user may refer to www.pppindia.com and www.infrastructure.gov.in.
Demographics, current transportation scenario along with regional development have
been broadly discussed in socio-economic section.
The requirements on basic data assembly inter-alia provide (a) information on use of
satellite imageries for alignment identification; (b) Global Positioning System (GPS); and
(c) Geographic Information System (GIS).

Environmental impact study and resettlement & rehabilitation action plan is based on
current practices and are subject to modification conforming to future developments.
Soil material investigation section covers broadly the aspect on collection of data on
material availability, geotechnical & sub-soil exploration and the hydraulic & hydrological
studies.
Chapter – 2 :
Route Planning
This chapter documents “expressway alignment selection process” considering
engineering, economic, social, ecology and aesthetics aspects.
Evaluation of alternative alignments has been based on (i) social-economic and
environmental criteria; and (ii) engineering (operational) aspects including costs. Individual
ranking matrices has been developed for evaluation. A simultaneous use, appreciation
and considerations of the ranking developed in the above matrices will help in deciding
selection of final alignment. This may not be “least cost one”.
Chapter – 3 :
Economic and Financial Viability Analysis
For implementation under BOT – DBFO format, financial analysis is of prime consideration.
Toll rates play a significant role.  The toll rates and link wise estimation of traffic as available
from “National Expressway Network” study will form the basis. However, for individual
project segments, it would be prudent to consider toll elasticity analysis, diversion-ratio
curve analysis and possible business development at road side facilities for possible
“traffic - toll rate” estimation.  The aspect of business development at road side has been
included in Volume-III: Operations and Management.
The current practice on financial analysis has been explained along with considerations
for sensitivity analysis. Apart from financial analysis, it is desirable to undertake economic
analysis of the Expressway projects as these will contribute to overall growth of the influence
area and the economy of the region as well as the country.
Chapter – 4 :
Expressway Capacity
On this aspect “Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) – 2000” is the document considered to
be authentic. However, highway capacity analysis is a complex procedure involving
generation of diverse data requirements for individual project segments.



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 528
======================================================================
XXI
Realizing the necessity of capacity analysis for situation in India, the MORTH have taken
up a research study to develop “HCM-India”.  The capacity analysis is primarily required
for (a) expressway segment between interchanges and; (b) at entry and exit ramps
junctions.  In absence of the conclusions from the above mentioned research study, as an
interim measure, the following have been presented for planning purposes.
For capacity analysis of expressway segments between interchanges, a user friendly
method has been illustrated considering the default values given in HCM-2000 and
subjective adoption of the necessary parameters. With the foregoing preamble, a Table
has been generated for use by the designer and deals with 2x2 lane and 2x3 lane
configuration using the cross-sectional elements and geometric criterion presented in
Volume-II: Design.
For capacity analysis at the junction of entry and exit ramps, the HCM procedure appears
to be too complex and require a lot of subjective data adoption. The simplified procedure
as developed and practiced in Japan has been adopted and included in this chapter.

CHAPTER – 1
SURVEY, INVESTIGATIONS AND PREPARATION OF THE PROJECT
1.1
INTRODUCTION
The Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways have decided to
construct fully access controlled expressways for 1000 km under National Highway
Development Project (NHDP-VI) through PPP (Public Private Participation) route on BOT
(Toll) mode following a DBFO (Design Build Finance and Operate) pattern with a maximum
Viability Gap Funding (VGF) of 40 percent.
In November 2009, the Final Project Report on MORTH study on “Formulation of Master
Plan for Indian National Expressway Network” has been submitted. The study is aimed at
phased development by the year 2012, 2017 and 2022.
The above two actions reflect the Government’s commitment for building Expressway
Network to strengthen the overall transportation system in the country.
These Expressway projects are conceived as green field projects and are planned to be
implemented through Public Private Partnership (PPP) using Built Operate and Transfer
(BOT) or Design Build Finance and Operate (DBFO) or any other mode with primarily
private financing. Implementation of Expressway network is likely to be divided into several
packages involving different concessionaires.
Preparation of expressway projects involves a chain of activities, such as, field surveys
and Investigations, selection of alignment, carrying out various designs, preparation of
drawings and estimates, etc.
The extent and quality of investigations have a strong influence on selection of the most
cost-effective design, assessment of projects cost including building, maintenance and
operations cost and execution of the job itself. As such, accuracy and completeness of
surveys deserve special attention in project preparation.
Systematic presentation of project details is the primary requirement. The project document
is the very basis of technical, administrative and financial assessment of a project. It is



======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
also crucial for accurate execution of work in the field. The project preparation document
should, therefore, be comprehensive enough for appreciation as well as easy
understanding of the details.
1.2
STAGES IN PROJECT PREPARATION
1.2.1
Context of IRC:SP:19-2001 for BOT/DBFOT Projects
The IRC:SP:19-2001, Manual for Survey, Investigations and Preparation of Road Projects,
gives detail guidance on project preparation, generally for projects funded by the national
government or international funding agencies. For PPP (Public Private Partnership)
projects under DBFO format, the requirements for project preparation including bidding
process are different which are not sufficiently covered in IRC:SP:19-2001.  This Guideline
Volume-I : Planning
i)
highlights special features in project preparation
ii)
provides additional aids to IRC:SP:19
For Greenfield Expressway
With the above preamble and to make this document self sufficient, IRC:SP:19-2001 is
briefly explained below alongwith the additional requirements for DBFO/DBFOT project
preparation. The conventional stages in project preparation are:
1)
Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)
2)
Feasibility Study (FS)
3)
Preliminary Project Report (PPR)
4)
Detailed Project Report (DPR)
The Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) will be based on the MORTH study which has identified
expressway network for implementation considering traffic and axle load prediction, LA
plan, R&R analysis, EIA, cost analysis and economic evaluation. Pre-feasibility Study for
implementation under BOT, BOOT, PPP, etc., section specific data need to be compiled
for further appreciation which shall be necessarily exhaustive.  This may include information
on the present status of the alignment, development potential, potential environmental
impact, traffic data, and preliminary cost assessment.  The analysis may also involve



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 528
======================================================================
Chapter - 1 : Survey, Investigations and Preparation of the Project
 I - 3
traffic studies, assessment of resource generation potential, funding pattern and probable
risks. The location of toll plaza, interchanges and wayside amenities may also need to be
examined.
The Feasibility Study (FS) is intended to establish whether the proposal is acceptable
in terms of engineering soundness and expected benefits from the project for the
investments involved. The prime objective of the Feasibility Study (FS) is to develop and
evaluate alternative possible alignments. Alternative alignments are done by studying the
satellite imageries and digital terrain model.  The process is essentially a desk study
supplemented by limited field visits and secondary data. On broad terms, the alternatives
are ranked on commercial considerations.
The Preliminary Project Report (PPR) involves a closer look on the identified alignments
in FS.  Using Digital Terrain Model (DTM), the vertical profile for each alignment shall be
developed.  Using the process of iteration and assigning numerical weightages/values,
an evaluation matrix shall be developed.  From this matrix, the “Optimum solution” shall be
derived.  On the optimum solution, the location of interchanges, cross drainage facilities,
underpasses and facility centres (wayside amenities, rest/service areas, traffic control
centres, toll plaza etc.) shall be identified and referenced in terms of latitude and longitude
of the probable places.
The Detailed Project Report covers detailed alignment surveys, soil and material
investigations, geological studies, drainage studies, detailed designs, environment
management plan based on environment impact assessment studies, rehabilitation and
resettlement action plan base on socio impact analysis, detailed drawings, estimates
and implementation schedules and other implementation related documents.
For projects under PPP, the requirements at various stages are different and may include
specific informations involving various degrees of accuracy in survey and investigations.
Currently, it has become a trend to go for bidding after completion of the FS and PPR
stage and DPR is left to the selected bidder.
The sequence of survey operations and project preparation may thus, have to be structured
to meet the specific needs of the project, its funding option and the requirements of the
authority responsible for implementation.

1.2.2
Legislative policies
While developing the alignment between two identified terminal locations, defined under
network planning, a designer has to deal with Social, Economic and Environmental issues
in parallel with Engineering and Technical studies.
The designer agency has to face project related approvals, agreements and permissions.
The various Acts which need to be satisfied are as follows:
i)
The Environmental Protection Act 1986 and the Environmental Impact
Assessment notification 1994. Various steps and requirements have been
prescribed for obtaining environmental clearances.
ii)
The Water and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, resulting
in establishment of Central and State Pollution Control Boards
iii)
The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 which pertains to diversion of forest area
for non-forestry use. It describes various steps for examination of such cases.
iv)
The Wild Life Protection Act,1972 to protect flora and fauna. A number of
national parks and sanctuaries were established in the last 25 years.
v)
The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It empowered the state government transport
authorities to enforce standards of vehicular pollution, its prevention and control.
vi)
The Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1938.
According to this Act, the area within a radius of 100 m and 300 m from the
protected property area is designated as protected area and controlled
area respectively.
vii) State level legislations and other Acts. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980
has been amended in 1998 in respect of road side plantation as protected
forest. Under this amendment, NHAI or any other competent authority shall
have to get clearance from departments for cutting trees.
The Applicable Acts and Rules relevant to the Expressway project are summarized in
Table 1.01.

1.2.3
Considerations for Public Private Partnership (PPP)
1.2.3.1
Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme
Viability Gap Funding (VGF) is to provide finance in the form of grant-in-aid for public-
private-partnership projects in infrastructure. VGF is meant to be available to PPP projects
with estimated internal rate of return of at least 12 percent.  Generally, PPP projects have
a debt-equity ratio of 70:30.
Currently, the maximum VGF for project is pegged at 40 percent of total project cost, of
which the Central Government pay 20 percent and another 20 percent comes from the
states/local administration bodies. The idea is to encourage private investments in areas
where the remunerative return is low in the absence of VGF element. In fact, VGF reduces
the capital cost for the concessionaire to make the project commercially viable.
An Empowered Committee has been formed for the purpose and there is a Guideline for
forwarding proposal for financial support to PPP in infrastructure project under VGF
scheme.  Project preparation requires to be submitted in the structured format devised by
the empowered Committee. The designer may consult www.pppinindia.com/p&f/
guidelines for the guidelines and format.
1.2.3.2
PPPAC - Requirements
The Central Government has notified a system for appraisal/approval of projects to be
under taken through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and the Guidelines were notified
by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs vide O.M. No. 1/5/2605-HP
dated 12th January 2006.
Pursuant to the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its
meeting of 27th October, 2005, a Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee
(PPPAC) has been set up comprising of the following:
a)
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (Chairperson)
b)
Secretary, Planning Commission
c)
Secretary, Department of Expenditure
d)
Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs and
e)
Secretary of the Department sponsoring a project

The Committee may Co-opt experts as necessary. Therefore, for all the PPP projects
(BOT, BOOT, BOLT, DBFO & DBFOT etc.) there is need to prepare the proposal as
required by PPPAC and presented in their structured format for approval.
The designer may consult www.infrastructure.gov.in for the guidelines and the format.
1.3
SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE
1.3.1
General
Given the terminal locations and the possible alignment options, it becomes necessary to
study the socio-economic profile of the project influence area. The green field expressways
will pass through mostly agricultural, barren or forest areas. Socio-economic studies,
comprising demographic aspects, macro-economic indicators and main economic
sectors provide an overview of the socio-economic setup of the project influence area as
well as a broad assessment of the perspective economic growth.
For a DBFO concessionaire, the objective of this study could be to look for development
in the adjoining lands for commercial gain, thus to offset the project cost and less reliance
on toll revenue (rates). This may also serve as device to control the ribbon development.
1.3.2
Demographics
Compiling regional (State level) and local (project influence area) economic and
demographic data is an important first step in assessing the possible alignment. Data
on population by geographic area provide a key indicator of the market served by the
expressway together with the existing/proposed transport network in the region and
thus the potential demand. Additional demographic data, such as income, vehicle
ownership, and children and elderly population can further help identify personal
transport needs.
Source of obtaining demographic data is the “Census of India” which is generally not
updated and consultation with local agencies may help in updating.  It may be prudent to
use the satellite imagery or aerial photogrammetry to estimate population and economic
data.  Photographic details can be analyzed to determine the location of housing units
and thereby to estimate the population of an area. Photographic/mosaics can also be
used for broad land use pattern, extent of urbanization, concentrations of businesses as
well as major industries.

======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
1.3.3
Current transport conditions
An inventory of the location, extent and quality of the present day transport network is a
key step for assessment of the possible future development options by the concessionaries.
Key characteristics of roads and highways include functional class (NH,SH,MDR,ODR,VR
etc.) and other route designation (Panchayat, forest etc), truck and/or bus routes, limited
access (seasonal), number of lanes, shoulder widths, design speed, capacity and
pavement type and condition. The location of intermodal terminals including rail, airports,
ports and places of importance alongwith the characteristics of roads accessing these
terminals (especially suitability for truck traffic) are also the key data element. A combination
of interviews with local professionals, site visits, field data collection and other appropriate
means can be adopted alongwith use of satellite imagery and aerial photogrametry.
1.3.4
Other important considerations
Additional data such as Economic data on number of establishments and total employment
in an area can indicate major destinations of goods movement and business travel.
Economic data by type of industry is important for assessing needs of transport services.
The major indicators of importance (not necessarily exhaustive) are as follows:
•
Urbanization
The share of urban population in terms of percentage of the state populations
and Average Density (population/sq.m) and the pattern of urban development
are good indicators.
•
State Income: Net State Domestic Product (NSDP)
The rate of change of NSDP at constant prices is the main economic
indicator for measuring real growth in economy which can be related to
growth in transport demand. Time series data on sectoral growth (primary,
secondary and tertiary) and sectoral composition provides overall status of
developmental economy.  The time series data on NSDP may be collected
from the State.
•
Economic Perspective – State Level
The likely traffic movements are indicated by the overall State
economy and especially in the project hinterland and influence area.



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 528
======================================================================
Chapter - 1 : Survey, Investigations and Preparation of the Project
 I - 9
This can be decided/assessed/appreciated by analyzing time series
data on NSDP at constant prices and income originating from the
main economic sectors.
•
Future – Five Year Plans and Perspective Growth Rate
The “Five Year Plans” sets targets for Gross State Domestic Product
(GSDP) annual growth rate.  These are assumed to be achieved by the
accelerated economic development in the State through infrastructure
development, with more private participation in all possible areas,
ensuring higher order growth in industrial, agricultural and creating large-
scale employment.
On study of long term (preferably for last 10 years) growth rate, expected/
planned strengthening measures, the perspective growth rates for short
term and long term (Stable) can be assessed.
•
Economic Perspective – Project Area Economies
In order to prepare the perspective for project area economies, the relative
importance of project influence area in the respective State economy used
to be studied.  For this purpose, various socio-economic indicators broadly
related to demography and state of economy are considered.  The main
indicators, subject to availability of data at district level, are as follows:
-
Population density (persons per sq.km)
-
Level of urbanisation (percentage of urban population)
-
Literacy rate in percentage
-
Work participation rate
-
Percentage area irrigated
-
Number of personal vehicles per 1000 of population
-
Road length in km per 1000 of population
As indicated above, the choice of indicators has been based on the data availability at
district level. On the basis of the above indicators, the performance of the districts is
compared with that of the State average.

different periods shall be prepared.
1.4
BASIC DATA ASSEMBLY
1.4.1
Introduction
This covers primarily desk studies of various documents to collect information on
strategic importance. The objective is to select the most feasible route, or routes, for
more detailed investigation. The green field expressway network with broad
identification of terminal locations in the “National Expressway Network Study”, would
require geographically locating the cardinal points. Fixing the alignment would require
the following steps:
a)
Preparing the alignment options on Survey of India (SOI) Topographic
Sheets (Topo Sheets) (generally 1:50,000) with the objective to identify
the corridor on which satellite imagery data shall be obtained.
Alternatively, NRSC can provide reference maps for the different
satellite missions from which data is acquired. An Integrated Digital
Referencing Scheme (IDRS) software package which can be run on
any PC with Windows environment is also available. By utilising this
package, the user’s area of interest (place, polygon, mapsheet, etc.)
can be converted into path/row number of the required satellite mission.
A print out of the plot showing the nominal coverage can also be
obtained. IDRS package is available at NRSC web site as free
download. It is available under utilities option in the website. (http://
www.nrsa.gov.in/products/area_coverage.html)
b)
Large scale satellite imagery with road and rail network overlaid there on,
provides updated ground information on natural and manmade features.
The preliminary selection of various alternatives can be made on the satellite
imageries. These alignments (based on latitude-longitude values) shall be
transferred on topographic sheets (Survey of India) for physical identification
as well as ground contour and land use information.
c)
For each of these alternatives, using Digital Terrain Model (DTM), the vertical
profiles can be developed and optimum solutions can be evolved
comparing/appreciating merits and demerits of each alignment.



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 528
======================================================================
Chapter - 1 : Survey, Investigations and Preparation of the Project
 I - 11
d)
On the selected alignment, the locations of interchanges and facilities
(wayside amenities, automatic traffic control centres etc.) shall be marked
and a preliminary land acquisition plan, demarcating the Right of Way, shall
be prepared.
This selected alignment will form the basis of further studies relating to the planning, design,
development, construction and operation of the Expressway.
With the above preamble, the following informations have been collated as designer’s aid.
1.4.2
Methods for reconnaissance survey
The quality of the study is dependent on the available data, the thoroughness and care
exercised in its collection and the professional utilization of this information to the fullest
extent.
Base mapping is a prime necessity. This can be either topographic or photographic aerial
mosaic or satellite imageries. Moreover, the requirement to some extent is also dependent
on the nature of the terrain concerned.
In a flat or gently rolling terrain, the contour intervals may be of less importance, whereas
the information on existing culture, land use, afforestation etc. may be dominant features
for considerations.
In rolling and hilly terrain, the road location may mainly be governed by the topography due to
limitations imposed by hills, valleys, steep slopes, rivers, swamps and lakes. Information
regarding topography and physical features should, therefore, be obtained in the early stages
of planning and design.
The possible sources of data, not necessarily exhaustive and updated to the extent
available, are as follows:
1.4.3
Survey of India (SOI) maps
i)
Topographical Maps on Scale 1:25,000; 1:50,000 and 1:250,000
Map coverage on 1:50,000 and 1:250,000 scale is available for whole of
India. Certain restricted areas require permission/approval of appropriate
authority for usage and study of the maps of those areas. Map coverage on
1:25,000 scale is for about 30 percent of the Indian Territory.



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 528
======================================================================
 I - 12
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
ii)
State Maps on Scale 1:1,000,000
Most of the states are covered and preparation of maps for a few states is
in progress. These state maps are useful as an index map or to get an
overview on impact of the project.
iii)
Plastic Relief Maps on Scale 1:15,000,000
These maps are uniquely applicable to expressway location planning
because they provide a three dimensional map of the area delineating
ridges, valleys, peaks etc with cultural, broad land uses and contour
information. These are useful for presentation aids to demonstrate the
general terrain of the location area.
Although the maps mentioned above may have been prepared long ago and
are not updated, still these are very much useful and a reliable source of
information on elevations and overall perceptions of the topography specially
on major waterways natural or manmade and important water bodies.
iv)
Forest Survey of India, Vegetation Maps on scale 1:25,000,000
The incidence of vegetation e.g. orchards, reserve forest, cluster of trees or
social forestry are the ‘hazards’ in selection of alignment. Ministry of
Environment and Forests have set guidelines on these aspects. A reference
to these maps may prove beneficial in decision making.
v)
National Bureau of Soil Surveys and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP), Nagpur
The NBSS & LUP, Nagpur  publishes soil maps as well as information on
land use. The information on soil includes classification in terms of geological
formation. The land use includes information on built-up areas, agriculture,
plantation, wasteland, rivers/streams/lakes, grassland, meadows and areas
prone to land slides etc.
vi)
Geological Survey of India and State Geology and Mining Departments
Information on geology, geomorphology, construction material, drainage and
changes in river courses, ground water are quite vital for the feasibility of



======================================================================

 I - 13
the alignment. Above mentioned Departments produce maps of geology
and allied themes periodically. These maps are generally available on scale
1:250,000 or smaller.
1.4.4
Aerial photography
i)
Status of Existing Aerial Photography (AP) in India
Aerial Photography on scale 1:50,000 is available for whole of India. The
negatives of this photography can be enlarged reasonably around five times.
The enlargement can be done even up to ten times depending on the quality
of AP. Photo enlargements on scale 1:10,000 and/or 1:5,000 can also be
obtained. These photo enlargements are quite adequate for the study of:
a) Geology, geomorphology and groundwater prospecting,
b) Environmental factors e.g. vegetation, soil conditions, land use etc.
Some information like power lines, telephone lines, hidden pipelines etc.
have to be supplemented by field visits. Since procurement of photographs
presents some difficulty due to the security reasons, adequate prior actions
need to be taken.
Existing aerial photographs have a wealth of information which can also be
of help in locating quarry-site, approach roads, etc and the expressway
planner can derive immense use of these aerial photographs. The ground
can be seen in three dimensions using a stereoscope.
ii)
Aerial Photography is being used intensively in India for long. There are
agencies who can provide the conventional (formats 23 cm x 23 cm) aerial
photography on commercial basis and after due clearance from the Ministry
of Defence. The clearance can take 3 to 4 months and even more and
takes considerable perseverance and follow up. The coverage on various
scales is given below:
1:10,000   23 cm x 23 cm format   cover 2.3 km x 2.3 km
1:5,000    23 cm x 23 cm format    cover 1.2 km x 1.2 km

Photogrammetry support
Photogrammetry as technology is useful in many ways. Large scale maps on scales of
1:2,000 to 1:25,000 can be very precisely produced through photogrammetric process.
The contouring can also be produced; the contour interval depends on the height of camera.
Since very minute and precise measurements are made on geometric optical model,
accurate measurements amounting to sub-meter accuracy can be performed. In other
words, profile (with height values) and sections across expressway centre line can be
extracted from optical model.
1.4.6
Satellite remote sensing and allied activities
Photographic products of imagery are available from National Remote Sensing Centre
(NRSC), Hyderabad on scales of 1:12,500; 1:25,000 and 1:50,000. Digital products are also
available in floppy, cartridge and tapes. The launch of IRS-P6 (Resourcesat -1) in October
2003 and IRS-P5 (Cartosat-1) in May, 2005 provided an excellent opportunity to obtain high
resolution multi spectral data for large scale mapping and terrain modelling application.
The cartridge tape can be digitally processed in the computer and the image on the monitor
can be interpreted with the possibility of enhancement of the quality of image through
manipulation of image processing software.
A major advantage of satellite imagery is its repeatability. On a regular basis Orbiting
satellites even monitor a natural phenomenon. We also get the latest information on the
physical features. Survey of India map even in a restricted area can, therefore, be updated
in planimetry with the help of the imagery. The latest information about the extent of
development and change in land use is very useful in the alignment study.
Interpretation of natural resources themes, namely geology, geomorphology, land use, soil
status (water logging, erosion), ground water, drainage, vegetation and forests is quite easily
done on the satellite imagery. Indeed, land information from satellite imagery is the most useful.
1.4.7
Small Format Aerial Photography (SFAP)
As mentioned earlier, conventional aerial photography (format 23 cm x 23 cm) has been
practiced in India for the last fifty years or more. There are three agencies in India who
carry out the aerial photography, namely, National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA),

Hyderabad, Air Survey Company, Kolkata and Indian Air Force. The traditional format is
quite alright if the project area is large and mapping is the main objective.
In Small Format Aerial Photography (SFAP), the simple method of taking aerial
photography has been designed. Instead of large format (format 23 cm x 23 cm), an
ordinary/commercial camera of 35 mm or 70 mm format is used. The film is also ordinary
film which is available in the market. This can be colour or black and white.
The camera is placed on a single engine small aircraft at low cruising speed. In some
cases, a simple modification is done in the aircraft by putting a hole and camera is fitted
with a suitable mount. Of course any aerial photography requires clearance from the Ministry
of Defence. The major advantages of SFAP are:
i)
Very large scale true colour photo enlargements can be done. Scale upto
1:1,000 to 1:2,000 scales are possible from 1:10,000 scale SFAP.
Acquisition plans alongside of expressway can be prepared on 1:4,000
scale.
ii)
Monitoring of urban areas, villages and environment along the corridor is
possible at comparatively lower cost than ground surveys.
1.4.8
Geographic Information System (GIS)
GIS is the current methodology to handle vast amount of complex spatial data in an optimum
manner. Naturally, use of computer hardware and software are the basic requirements.
Preparation of data-base which is an input to GIS takes most of the efforts.
Gradual emphasis has started emerging, for use of GIS in highways discipline. GIS is
being strongly recommended. Besides, physical (land information) GIS is capable of
storing data about traffic, accidents, road inventory, environmental parameters, drainage
structures and a host of other information and ‘attributes’ of the data needed by an
expressway planner. This is done through different layers stored in the computer.
A properly organised GIS will eventually become the workhorse for the planner/designer of the
expressway. Recently, NHAI has developed a GIS based Road Information System (RIS).
1.4.9
Global Positioning System (GPS)
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 528
======================================================================
 I - 16
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
from a constellation of 24 satellites and their ground stations. These are orbiting around
the earth at a distance of 20,000 kilometers. A minimum of four satellites are needed to
give a ‘reselected fix’ (X,Y and Z) on the ground, at any time of the day or night. The
observations are made on an instrument called geo-receiver.
GPS works in five logical steps:
i)
The basis of GPS is, “triangulation” from satellites.
ii)
To “triangulate,” a GPS receiver measures distance using the travel time of
radio signals.
iii)
To measure travel time, GPS needs very accurate timing which it achieves
with some tricks.
iv)
Along with distance, you need to know exactly where the satellites are in
space. High orbits and careful monitoring are crucial.
v)
Finally it requires correction for any delays which the signal experiences as
it travels through the atmosphere.
When GPS is used in a single instrument mode, (shown in Fig. 1.01(a)), the accuracy is
nearly a few meters or so. This accuracy is not adequate for the expressway (fixing of
centre line). For precise work with required accuracy (few centimeters), two instruments
of geo-receivers are used as ground stations. One instrument is fixed on a point whose
coordinates are known which means it monitors variations in the GPS signal and
communicates those variations to the other receiver, while the other is taken to the site,
this can then correct its calculations for better accuracy. This mode is known as Differential
GPS (DGPS) (shown in Fig. 1.01(b)).
Another technique called “Carrier-phase GPS”, takes advantage of the GPS signal’s
carrier signal to improve accuracy. The carrier frequency is much higher than the GPS
signal which means it can be used for more precise timing measurements.
The GPS technology does not need the pre-requisite of the intervisibility of two ground
points. This technology gives the highest productivity in field surveys and allied tasks. It is
eminently suitable for fixing the centre line of the alignment. The determination of level/
elevation is still a weak point of this technology.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY AND RESETTLEMENT AND
REHABILITATION ACTION PLAN
1.5.1
General
An expressway facility provides numerous socio-economic benefits including all weather
reliability, reduced transportation costs, increased efficiency to emerging/existing markets,
growth centres, access to employment centres, employment to local workers on the project
itself, better access to health care and other social services and strengthening of regional
economies in particular and national economies in general.
However, such large scale highway projects as i.e. expressways are likely to be associated
with several adverse impacts during construction, maintenance and operation stages.
The most significant construction related impacts are those related to clearing, grading or
road bed construction; loss of vegetative cover; foreclosure of land uses; property severance
at community and individual levels; changes in natural drainage patterns; changes in ground
water elevation, land slides, erosion, stream, ponds and lake sedimentation, degradation
of cultural sites, and interference with movements of wild life, live stock and local residents.
Many of these impacts can arise not only at construction sites but also at quarries,
borrowpits and material storage areas serving the project. In addition, these adverse
environmental and socio-cultural impacts can occur during planning, construction and
maintenance stages as a result of property/land severance; air and ground pollution from
construction plants; and vehicle movements dust, noise from construction equipment and
blasting; use of pesticides; fuel and oil spills; trash and garbage etc.

vi)
Disruption of communication network
vii)
Impairment of fisheries, wild life, local forests and aquatic ecology due to habitat
loss and encroachments
viii)

xii)
Migration tendency from rural to urban areas leading to unplanned growth
xiii)
The poor expressway drainage may lead to flooding problems, degradation of water
resources and formation of new gullies
xiv)
Air quality in the influence zone of expressway will get deteriorated due to vehicular
exhaust and smoke
xv)
Impairment of scenic beauty, openness and aesthetics during construction and
operation of facility
The direct impacts from expressway use may include creation of physical barriers to
existing physical and social linkages, increased demand for motor fuels; increased
air pollution, noise and road side litter, injury and death to animals and people during
accidents, health risk and environmental damage from accidents involving hazardous
materials in transit, and water pollution from spills or accumulated contaminants on
road surfaces.
Many of these direct impacts on natural systems, historical and cultural resources and
right-of-way land uses (i.e. property severance) can be avoided if their causes and effects
are understood at planning stage and remedial measures/mitigating measures
incorporated at design stage and their implementation monitored during construction and
post-construction stages.
On the other hand, an aesthetically planned, designed, developed and maintained
expressway is not only pleasing to the eye but it also adds to travelling comfort, enhances
environmental quality and provides better safety in traffic operations. Therefore, while
planning expressway facility, various activities such as choice of location for interchanges,
toll plazas, access and exit points, wayside amenities, facilities etc; selection of pleasing
alignment which merges with surrounding topography and natural environment; grassing
and planting on road-side; provision of services and utilities, etc should be given due
consideration and incorporated in design.
It is also important to examine the distribution of impacts. Equity among social classes
may also be important.  Besides Expressway funding (by concessionaires), additional
funding for regional development shall also be looked into.
As a safeguard against the adverse impacts on the environment, it has been considered
essential to carry out Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) including Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Possible Mitigation
Measures and Environmental Management Plan (EMP), be prepared at different stages
matching with significant impacts identified during IEE.
The basic aim of these guidelines is for study, examination, evaluation of environmental
issues and preparation of Environmental Management Plan arising out of human activities
on account of planning, design and implementation of an expressway project. An
expressway project which generally provides numerous direct and indirect benefits should
also be environmentally sound so as to ensure sustainable development of the region.
Therefore, for undertaking any development activity, whether new project including roads and
highways or expansion or modernization, it has been made mandatory to seek environmental
clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF), Government of India as per
their Notification dated 27.1.1994 and amended on 4.5.1994 for projects listed under Schedule
I of the said notification. As per this notification, no highway project shall be undertaken in any
part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by the Central Government,
MOEF, India.
The procedure for seeking environmental clearance from MOEF is covered under Schedule
II of this notification accompanied by a Detailed Project Report which in turn shall interalia
include an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report and Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) prepared in accordance with Environmental Guidelines for Rail/
Road/Highway Projects by MOEF, Department of Environment, Forests and Wildlife,
Government of India, New Delhi, 1989 and modified from time to time.
These guidelines on environmental system and aesthetics will go a long way in planning,
design and implementation of expressway projects on sustainable basis under Indian
conditions and have been provided under the following heads:

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
Information should be collected on existing environmental conditions for IEE along the
selected alignment to determine the need for further environmental assessments, design
and management studies.
Positive and negative impacts of new expressway shall be identified. Cost-effective
measures shall be proposed to enhance the positive impacts and to avoid or mitigate the
effect of negative impacts.
Where felt necessary, public consultation on positive and negative impacts with the affected
groups or involved NGO’s may be carried out. Specially mitigation measures for negative
impacts and assuring measures for positive impacts shall be explained.
1.5.3
Environmental design
From the environmental analysis, all elements with potential for adverse impacts should
be identified, for which steps can then be taken to avoid/mitigate through judicious
design changes, for example, shifting the road alignment to save trees on one side of
the road. Adverse impacts, such as, soil erosion, flooding, loss of vegetation cover,
etc. should be identified and appropriate mitigating measures, like, ground cover
planting, installation of proper drainage system, etc. incorporated in design to reduce
the impact. Cost effective proposals may also be included in the design proposal to
suitably enhance the environmental quality along the expressway alignment in a
sustainable manner.
1.5.4
Environmental management action plan
An implementation schedule and supervision programme may be prepared for timely
execution of environmental mitigation and design works and all efforts may be made to
follow the same. The programme for monitoring environmental impacts during construction
and operation should be developed.
For such large projects, the requirement for institutional strengthening and training facility
for personnel to be deployed on environmental works should be specified.
Any further studies of environmental issues, which are required to be undertaken during
project implementation, should be recommended.
1.5.5
Resettlement and rehabilitation action plan (RAP)
Whenever the project will entail acquisition of land, structures and other assets and
cause displacement or loss of assets within the public right-of-way, the project should



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 528
======================================================================
Chapter - 1 : Survey, Investigations and Preparation of the Project
 I - 25
undertake a socio-economic base-line study and prepare a resettlement and
Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP).
The RAP has three main objectives
i)
To assess and bring out the impacts of land acquisition and assets for the
project civil works on the people who own properties in the area to be
acquired or live on the land to be acquired and/or derive their income from
the land or own enterprises operating on the land to be acquired.
ii)
To present the entitlement policy for compensation and assistance to
persons  affected by the project,
iii)
To prepare an action plan for delivery of compensation and assistance
outlined in the policy to the persons duly identified as entitled to such
assistance.
The present policy of the Government is that the persons adversely affected by the
project should receive benefits from it or at the least, they should not be worse off than
before because of the project. Since acquisition of land and other assets may be
unavoidable and an integral part of project design and implementation, undertaking a
social impact assessment and preparing RAP shall also be included as a part of
project design from the start and undertaken in close co-ordination with environmental
analysis and environmental action plan. Also, as far as possible involuntary settlement
may be avoided or at least minimized wherever possible, by exploring other alternative
project designs.
In cases where displacement, loss of assets or other negative impacts on people are
unavoidable, the project should assist the affected persons with means to improve their
former living standards, income-earning capacities, production levels or at least maintain
the previous standards of living.
Since no civil work can be undertaken on any stretch of road before land acquisition and
payment of compensation as per RAP, it is essential that planning and implementation of
civil works may be co-ordinated with RAP.
Preparation of RAP requires a thorough understanding of the local people, and the
social, economic and cultural factors influencing their lives. It is essential that detailed
base-line studies are conducted with a participatory approach through consultation
with potentially affected persons and other stake holders in the area, the local NGOs,
municipal authorities, etc. and a mutually satisfactory solution is achieved.

SOIL AND MATERIAL INVESTIGATIONS
1.6.1
Study of available information
The soil and materials location surveys should include study of all available information
such as geological maps, data published by the various authorities regarding location of
construction materials and the information available with ground water authorities
regarding depth of water table. Soil maps prepared by the local agricultural department. A
study of these data, if available, will be of great help in the planning and conduct of further
surveys and investigations.
After studying the available information, detailed programme of survey can be drawn up.
Points needing attention during detailed soil survey are highlighted further on.
1.6.2
Soil investigations for embankments
The first operation in the detailed soil survey is to demarcate the possible borrow areas.
The extent of borrow areas should be commensurate with the volume of work involved in
the embankment.
The general character of material excavated from test pits should be recorded alongwith
on site visual identification and tests conducted on it in the laboratory. Where the type of
material varies in a single pit, the tests should be conducted on each type of soil separately
and the horizon of occurrence noted. Similar tests should be carried out on material from
cuts for ascertaining the suitability of its use in the embankment.
1.6.3
Soil and material investigation
The activities shall include:
i)
Identification of potential sources (including use of fly-ash/slag), quarry sites
and borrow areas.
ii)
Estimate quality and quantities of various construction materials available
for collection of samples and conducting relevant laboratory tests.
iii)
Evaluation of test results and asses the suitability thereof for incorporation
in the various works and making recommendation on the use of the materials
from different sources based on techno-economic considerations.
iv)
Preparation of mass haul diagram and lead charts for quarry and borrow
areas indicating the location of selected borrow areas, quarries and the
respective estimated quantities.

b)
Sample Collection
Each quarry/material source will be visited by the Materials cum
Geotechnical Engineer, and the available material examined in detail.  The
location of the source, the approachability, ownership, any environmental
and social restrictions, volumes of material available for extraction, any
special installation/equipment required for extraction, visual assessment
about suitability, and other relevant information will be recorded.
Samples (30-40 kg) will be collected from each source adopting standard
sampling procedures.  These will be packed in suitable bags, labelled and
sent to laboratory for testing.
c)
Laboratory Testing of Borrow Soils and Granular Materials
The samples of materials for use in embankments, sub-grade and granular

2.1
ROUTING OF EXPRESSWAY
The selection for alignment or routing is a multi-stage process carried out interactively
with traffic and environmental assessments moulded with the aesthetic considerations
and social-development requirements.
On different facet, the selection of alignment is largely a compromise among the competing
sets of considerations:
Physical engineering features, safety, aesthetics, environmental and ecological aspects,
and the life cycle cost (i.e. construction, maintenance and operating costs). The objective
is to select the alignment which provides an optimum balance between the overall costs
and the identified needs of the population to be served by the expressway corridor.
The above requirements as well as guiding factors are mostly subjective, case specific
involving topography, regional settings and social environment. Very few recommendations/
guidelines are defined in code of practices in different countries covering all aspects of
selection of alignment. Hence attempt has been made to compile the various excerpts
available from books, publications, journals, periodicals and various project reports.
The various factors which influence alignment selection as identified in IRC:SP:19-2001
and TRRL Supplementary Report 279 are given in Fig. 2.01. This primarily demonstrates
the interlinkages on the diverse aspects in the route planning process. These have been
further illustrated in the subsequent sections.
The selection of alignment requires collection of available maps and information on the
possible connecting routes. Hence the approach for this varies depending on the
availability of the related maps, land records and related documents.
2.2
CONSIDERATIONS IN EXPRESSWAY ALIGNMENT SELECTION
The major identifiable study activities (and the usual sequence) leading to the selection of
the most feasible alternatives can be grouped into two broad requirements.
A)
Basic data assembly or collection of information
B)
Review of data and evaluation of alternatives, which include

ii) Developing alternative solutions, refinement of alignment to minimize
potential adverse impacts:

- Testing alternatives
- Refining alternatives
iii) Evaluation and selection of preferred alternatives;
iv) Warrants against common mistakes.
2.3
SELECTION OF ALTERNATIVE ALIGNMENTS
The most critical aspect is to develop alternative alignments. The two basic processes are:
i)
Identification of controls - physical, economical, social, environmental,
religious places, historical monuments, swamps, social forestry etc;
ii)
Engineering aspects - that is technical solutions to overcome the hazards
along the alignment with economic consideration in view.
It is essential to become familiar with the project area before beginning the
selection of alignment and therefore collection and collation of sufficient
information is prerequisite. This should be followed by review of the data
and reconnaissance of project area.
i)
Identification of Controls
The controls imposed on a route location may take many forms, important of which are
physical, economic, social, political and environmental controls. Most of these become
evident at the data assembly stages.
Physical controls are most influential because predominantly these affect basic corridor
selection, particularly from technical and operational aspects of the road users. Economic
controls generally take the form of development influence on a particular route vis-à-vis
the alternative. The most important single control is disruption to people and housing.
Land use - Economic and Development Potential
The achievement of a proper balance between the creation of new opportunities for
development and preservation of existing community values poses a unique challenge in



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 528
======================================================================
I - 36
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
selection of alignment. During this phase, possibilities of land use development for
commercial gain should be given emphasis for prospective BOT schemes.
The prime objective will be focused towards promoting development. The alternative goal
is sometimes prominent in selection of an alignment; that is, an area is either already
sufficiently developed or there are plans for future development. Under such circumstances,
the aspect of access control and the need for providing service road facilities become
important considerations.
Development of Alternative Alignments
Selection of alternative alignment is started on updated base map after the control points
have been identified and sufficient knowledge is developed on the region. Basic guidelines
which merit considerations are stated below.
ii)
Engineering Aspects
The alignment selection should be done keeping in mind that the expressways are conceived
to provide a high speed and high quality of service to the users of traffic. The followings
should form the basis for development of alternative alignments.
i)
Safety is a primary consideration.  Accordingly, the design parameters like
speed, curvature, gradient etc. shall be selected to match with the
topography. The driver shall be ensured of safe and comfortable driving.
Consideration is given to the high percentage of trucks in selection of
geometric elements.
ii)
The alignment should be free flowing in nature and based on the driver’s
expectation which is normally guided by his immediate past experience on
observations of roadway, terrain, environmental and traffic conditions. Any
design which fails to meet these expectations such as abrupt changes in some
geometric features might surprise the driver and precipitate to severe accidents.
iii)
The alignment shall maintain a good balance and shall fit into the surrounding
natural and social conditions such as topography, natural features and land
utilization plans. A balance should be maintained on technical and economic
suitability.
iv)
Aesthetic considerations and environmental factors play an important role
which should be clearly defined and the impacts are studied before

finalization of the alignment. The factors to be examined are: presence of
historic, heritage or religious places, environmentally sensitive streams,
agricultural land, impacts and mitigating approaches, ground water impacts,
wet lands, noise etc.
Broadly the alignment can be defined as a combination of horizontal and vertical geometric
elements. The general rules for their use are stated below:
Horizontal Alignment
Horizontal Alignment is a combination of curves and straight lines. The followings are the
general principles:
-
The alignment shall be continuous out fitted to topography;
-
The largest possible curve radius or straight lines are to be used on high
embankment and on cut sections;
-
Clothoid curves shall be inserted between the straight and curve elements
-
Compounding of circular curves are to be avoided and a clothoid be inserted;
-
Broken back alignment shall be avoided;
-
Maintain a relationship with vertical alignment for satisfaction of aesthetics
and avoiding visual distortion
Application of Straight Lines
Straight lines shall preferably be avoided from safety and aesthetic considerations.
However, under the following circumstances, straight lines may be adopted
-
Flat land and wide valley located between mountains;
-
An area which has straight lines element of road network, in an urban area
or suburbs;
-
Long and large bridges or long viaduct sections;
-
Tunnel sections.
Within the limitations, straight lines are adopted with length restrictions. The
recommendations of various standards are:
-
Road Element Guidance for rural areas in Germany recommends a maximum
length of twenty (20) times (in metre)  the design speed (in km/hour);
-
Japan recommends the maximum straight lengths same as Germany and
for minimum lengths as given below:



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 528
======================================================================
I - 38
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
-
IRC recommends a maximum length of three (3) km.
Japan practice may be useful since the same provides better considerations.
Combination of horizontal and vertical profile
This Guideline in Volume-II: Design has dealt with this aspect in more depth. However, the
following narrations are expected to be handy in decision making process. The proper
combination of horizontal alignment and profile is obtained by engineering study and
consideration of the following general controls:
i)
Curvature and grades should be in proper balance. Tangent alignment or
flat curvature at the expense of steep or long grades and excessive curvature
with flat grades are both poor design. A logical design that offers the most
in safety, capacity, ease and uniformity of operation, and pleasing
appearance within the practical limits of terrain and area traversed is a
compromise between the two extremes.
ii)
Vertical curvature superimposed on horizontal curvature, or vice versa
generally results in a more pleasing facility, but it should be analyzed for
effect on traffic. Successive changes in vertical profile not in combination
with horizontal curvature may result in a series of humps visible to the driver
for some distance, an undesirable condition as previously discussed. The
use of horizontal and vertical alignments in combination, however, may also
result in certain undesirable arrangements, as discussed later in this section.
iii)
Sharp horizontal curvature should not be introduced at or near the top of a
pronounced crest vertical curve. This condition is undesirable in that the
driver cannot perceive the horizontal change in alignment, especially at night
when the headlight beams go straight ahead into space. The difficulty of

this arrangement is avoided if the horizontal curvature leads the vertical
curvature, i.e, the horizontal curve is made longer than the vertical curve.
Suitable design can also be made by using design values well above the
minima for the design speed.
iv)
On divided expressways with varying width of median, the use of separate
profiles and horizontal alignments should be considered to drive design
and operational advantage of one-way roadways.
v)
In residential areas, the alignment should be designed to minimize nuisance
factors to the neighbourhood. Minor horizontal adjustments can sometime
be made to increase the buffer zone between the expressway and clusters
of residences.
vi)
The alignment should be designed to enhance attractive scenic views of
the natural and manmade environment, such as rivers, rock formations,
parks, outstanding buildings, and golf courses. The expressway should head
into rather than away from those views that are outstanding, it should fall
toward those features of interest at a low elevation, and it should rise toward
those features best seen from below or in silhouette against the sky.
2.3.1
Evaluation of alternative alignments
The objective of this phase of the alignment study is to compile all the information on the
alternative routes in a manner which can be documented with text and maps. This inter-alia
includes the selection and recommendation of alternatives, the satisfaction of set goals,
preliminary geometric/safety analysis, and documentation with reasons for elimination of
less feasible alternatives. The evaluation of the alternatives may be based on:
i)
Social, Economic and Environmental criteria;
ii)
Engineering considerations.
The criteria of both the above two sets are interdependent and should be considered
together.
Social, Economic and Environmental Criteria
Of the inputs affecting alignment evaluation, none are more subjective than the social,



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 528
======================================================================
I - 40
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
economic and environmental criteria. It is very difficult to quantify these factors in a generally
acceptable manner. However, to make the evaluation more objective (ie. less subjective),
the approach for evaluation may be based on:
1)
Transportation related criteria;
2)
Economic criteria;
3)
Social criteria;
4)
Regional planning criteria; and
5)
Aesthetic design criteria.
The five classifications can be analysed by assigning relative percentage weights, totalling
one hundred percent, with respect to stated project goals or objectives, if a consensus
can be reached. Each of the five major classifications is then subdivided into several
subordinate classifications for more thorough evaluation. The twenty-five factors for social,
economic and environmental effects Table 2.01 identified by the FHWA are subordinate
classifications established for individual evaluation. Each of the twenty-five sub-
classifications can be assigned a relative weight within the major criteria divisions. The
example presents a hypothetical set of route alternatives applied to the rating system.
Each of the alternative alignments can be evaluated with respect to these criteria and the
location receiving the highest “grade” would be most beneficial (under the assumed weightings),
and hence the recommended alignment. Each of the twenty-five sub-classifications is rated
on a percentage basis (with 100 per cent being the ideal condition) for each alternative, and
this is multiplied by the weighting factor for the element to produce a score for each alternative
in each classification. Thus further rankings within each criterion are possible. The influences
on the criteria classifications are discussed in the following paragraphs.
1)
Transportation Related Criteria- Annual road-user costs are the basis for
comparing alternatives with respect to fast, safe and efficient transportation.
Lower road user costs are indicative of more efficient traffic service. This is a
function of alignment geometrics and length of the alignment.
Ratings for engineering, right-of-way, and construction costs are inversely related
to the respective amounts. The lower cost alternatives receive higher ratings.
Maintenance and operating costs are primarily a function of length but potential
erosion and stability problems must be considered. This includes factors such



======================================================================

======================================================================
I - 41
Chapter - 2 : Route Planning
as the terrain and topography, deep cuts and high fills, waterway diversions
and crossings, and the like. The highest ratings in this classification are achieved
by the shorter alternatives with minimal disturbance to the existing terrain. The
rating is influenced by the relation of its total to the prevailing conditions.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
With respect to serving national security, the ratings are higher for alignments
which generate highest design standards and those which provide superior
service to the traffic movement.
Alternatives which better interconnect with the existing highway network,
and disrupt it least, rate higher. Higher ratings are also given to alignments
which provide better continuity and lesser interruption of existing public
service and utility networks.
Alternatives that disrupt the operation and use of the existing facilities the
least during and after construction, rate highest in this classification evaluation.
2)
Economic Criteria- The sub-classification of the economic criteria are
economic activity, employment, and property values. In the example shown
each is assigned an equal point value because of the close interrelationships
among the three. Alternative locations which open new areas for development
enhance all three criteria and are rated high. Locations which provide superior
connections to the existing system also encourage economic growth, and
are rated accordingly. Alternatives that tend to isolate or conflict with economic
activity receive the lowest ratings in this criteria class.
3)
Social Criteria- The two most influential sub-classifications under social
criteria are displacement of families and businesses, and replacement
housing. The locations which, for the most part, do not impact upon existing
development naturally displace fewer families and businesses, require less
attention to replacement provisions, and should thus receive high ratings.
Alternatives which best preserve local residential and neighborhood
character rate highest in this category. These alternatives likely are less
disruptive to existing educations districts and religious institutions also.
Alternatives which preserve and incorporate natural and historic landmarks
receive the highest rankings in this sub-classification.
4)
Regional Planning Criteria- Regional planning criteria which include open
spaces, parks and recreation, conduct and financing of government, and
multiple use of space are best satisfied with the regional planning
departments. Alternatives with known adjoining area support have built-in
advantages over less preferred routes.



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 528
======================================================================
I - 43
Chapter - 2 : Route Planning
The inclusion of joint development projects which promote multiple use of
space and enhance the economic gain definitely result in higher regional
planning ratings. Conversely, locations which neglect or adversely impose
upon local parks, recreation, open spaces, and local government financial
tax bases fare poorly in the rating of regional criteria.
5)
Aesthetic Design Criteria- The factors influencing ratings for aesthetics
are the view of the road, the view from the road, geometric form, and the fit
to the terrain. Locations which best satisfy these factors are rated the highest.
The objective of superior aesthetic design is of major concern.
The most important thing in aesthetic consideration is that the visual
information that the driver receives while driving should not make the driver
misunderstand and get confused. The following points should be given
attention in expressway routing.
-
Preserve natural beauties and avoid crossing places which should be
protected. Routing should be selected to be in harmony with the natural
landscape and the regional culture.
-
In mountainous and hilly areas, routing should have an alignment to
harmonize with the landform of the nature. The change of the view creates
enjoyable driving. A vast panoramic view opens out after a mountain
path or sudden appearance of a grand view of a mountain after a curve
gives a great change of atmosphere.
-
In open country areas, making the expressway embankment as low as
possible with gentle inclination of the slopes of the embankment produces
harmonious blending of the expressway with the topography.
-
When there is a famous building or a historic relic, routing should
incorporate them as landmarks. When they appear and disappear while
driving along the vicinity, it gives enjoyable change of view to the driver.
Noise and air pollution associated with a highway location are directly related to traffic
volume on the facility and the capacity of the facility to carry the traffic in a smooth and
efficient manner. Wider rights-of-way, depressed sections, and roadside landscaping
contribute to noise abatement. Construction of new expressway facilities improves the
traffic flow conditions which reduce the amount of contaminants in the air.



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 528
======================================================================
I - 44
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
Moreover, vehicle emission control standards had become more effective in the early
2000’s. This would also help in reducing air pollution.
Water pollution associated with a new highway facility is usually the result of the application
of various chemicals to control dust, weeds, ice, or snow. These applications usually do
not constitute a pollution threat. The alignment locations which exhibit the fewest pollution
generating characteristics receive the highest ratings in the sub-classification.
Ecology, wildlife, and sedimentation in water bodies due to soil erosion influence the
evaluation of alternatives with respect to conservation. Locations requiring extensive
clearing of natural flora, deep cuts, high fills and severe side hill construction are rated
lower due to the increased probability of erosion and sedimentation. Valley locations
parallel to water bodies are also likely to create this condition. The alternatives which
preserve and protect the natural environment with minimal disruption are rated high.
Analysis by Weighting
It may be noted, the approach suggested is seen as a significant tool for policy analysis.
The factors themselves and the weightages indicated for these factors are neither ‘’etched
in concrete’’ nor should they be. Thus: ‘’This list of effects is not meant to be exclusive, nor
does it mean that each effect considered must be given equal weight in making a
determination upon a particular highway location or design’’. In other words, the rating
values are by nature examples.  They are also subjective in nature.
Any listing or weighting system will be subjective. Furthermore, extreme difficulties can be
expected in developing a consensus, particularly within a multidisciplinary group. These
difficulties can be lessened, or at-least a perspective on the points of differences can be
obtained, by solving the problem by assigning a series of weights. This could be done
(1) systematically, (2) by an iterative process, and/or (3) in response to specific requests.
The net result would be to demonstrate how sensitive (or insensitive), the route location is
to individual social, economic, and aesthetic criteria.

Engineering Considerations
The various alternatives developed are to be evaluated from the operations considerations
and the problems and cost of construction. The entire alignment may be subdivided into
sections for evaluations which may thus be combined for assessment of the entire route.
Operations Consideration
As mentioned earlier, the straight lines would be the most preferred choice but it is likely
to encounter obstacles that would intervene. It may not be economically attractive to pass

through these obstacles. Moreover, long straight alignments are boring and may make
the drivers less alert.
A curvilinear alignment would be the most suited one. The broad aspects of assessments

CHAPTER – 3
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY ANALYSIS
A
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
3.1
INTRODUCTION
The approach methodology presented in this chapter is based on current practices followed
by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for Economic and Financial Analysis of the
projects undertaken in National Highway Development Projects (NHDP). At the beginning
in late 70’s and early 80’s, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank
framed guidelines for project appraisal on investment decisions. These guidelines provided
mostly for carrying out Economic Analysis. Subsequently with the change in funding
mechanism, during mid 90’s, the project appraisal and economic analysis were modified.
Finally when the Government of India (GoI) decided to levy fees for use of highways by the
road users, the guidelines for Financial Analysis were framed to assess commercial
viability with or without Government grant.
For implementation of Toll based Express Highway network, the Financial analysis shall be
carried out for decision making on project packages. The level of financial viability will indicate
the attractiveness of the package to the private sector. This will also help the Authority to
frame strategy as to the most appropriate financing structure for the package (project).
In financial analysis, the toll rates play a significant role and shall be considered.
3.1.1
Contextual appraisal
Before any analysis can be conducted respecting either general financial viability of the
project or prospects for private sector participation, a determination must be made as to
the rationale behind seeking private partners. If it is for purposes of full cost recovery, the
options and analyses cover a wider variety of choices; if it is solely for purposes of recovery
of recurrent costs (operations and maintenance only), the choices would be again different.
For full cost recovery which is the case for implementation of expressway network, the
analysis must be particularly rigorous, and the traffic forecasts detailed and set in the
context of various scenarios, with sensitivity analyses conducted.
3.1.2
Link to overall economy
Separate financial and economic appraisals need to be performed for each project; the



======================================================================

======================================================================
I - 52
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
former provides a measure of the commercial (financial) viability of the toll road, while the
latter measures the overall value of the project to the broader economies of the region
and the country as a whole. Both have similar features and draw upon the same basic
data. Both estimate the net benefits of an investment project.
Financial and Economic analyses are complementary.
While both types of analysis are conducted in monetary terms, the major difference lies in
the definition of costs and benefits. In financial analysis, all expenditures incurred under
the project, and all revenues resulting from use of the project are taken into account. This
form of analysis is necessary to:
i)
assess the degree to which a project will generate revenues sufficient to
meet its financial obligations;
ii)
assess the incentives for producers; and
iii)
ensure that traffic and other forecasts on which the analysis is based are
consistent with financial charges or otherwise available resources.
In the financial analysis, the unit of analysis is the project which may differ from the overall
program of highway construction. The project is the segment or segments of Expressway
network to be subject to tolling, combined with a program of construction for all or part of
that segment or segments. The de facto presumption will be that the stretch of highway to
be tolled is identical to the stretch to be constructed or upgraded.
3.1.3
Quality of work required
A financial evaluation is based on traffic forecasts, cost estimates and revenue
assumptions. As such it is not infallible. The objective is to determine whether a private
sector investor will find the project financially attractive, with subsequent responsibility for
verification of data and assumptions is left to the private investor and the financing
consortium to carry out due diligence. However, the evaluation does need to be as realistic
is possible so as not to mislead the private sector. This will be the case where the authority
has to maintain high standards of quality control and base all work, wherever possible, on
the best available empirical data.
3.1.4
Importance of traffic forecasts
For purposes of private sector participation, traffic forecasts become a key element in the
financial analysis as this is the cornerstone for revenues based on tolls. Traffic counts therefore
need to be conducted over a timeframe which is consistent with reality and consideration of



======================================================================

======================================================================

Chapter - 3 : Economic And Financial Viability Analysis
both peak hours of travel as well as seasonal variations. In this regard, if tolls are to be
introduced, a further assessment on future traffic in terms of likelihood and extent of toll
diversion also must be taken into account as this would significantly affect revenue projections.
Traffic forecasting for a green field expressway network with the presence of widened
4/6 lane National Highway Network is a complex process.
The traffic forecast on new expressway network (green field) need to be considered on
the basis of the benefits provided by the expressway. The traditional approach is to focus
on the benefits for the users, in terms of changes in travel time, safety, comfort, and operating
costs. These aspects are prone to vary on various segments of the expressway network
(10,000 km). A prudent approach would be (as followed in other countries also) to integrate
with the development of regional economy. These aspects are broadly identified as
•
User benefits (for trucks and non business vehicles only) in terms of travel
time, safety and vehicle operating costs
•
Business expansion impacts
•
Business attraction impacts
•
Tourism impacts
Based on Japan’s experience, the following aspects may be considered by the user of
this Guideline as cautionary measures.
-
The considerations which are too risky for toll road business
-
The concession period shall not be too long (i.e. more than 30 years)
-
The most important is users acceptance of toll rate
-
Adopting complex processes involving “difficult-to-find” database needing
more time and cost.
To appreciate and apprise the users of this document, special attention is drawn (for avoidance
of doubt, and by way of illustrations – based primarily of Japan’s experience) to the followings.
Toll Elasticity Analysis: With a lower toll rate, the toll road may have larger number of
users. However, this does not necessarily mean larger revenue. Toll elasticity means that
when the toll is lowered by one percent, by how much percent the traffic volume increases.
If the value is larger than one, then the toll revenue will be larger with the lower toll rate.
It is also important to understand the link between financial and economic viability in toll
roads. Because a distinctive feature of toll roads is that the realization of the economic



======================================================================

======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
benefits for the toll road is irrelevant to the economic viability. The level of toll rates that
meet debt service and financial returns may cause traffic diversion to an alternative route,
which may be highly inefficient outcome in terms of traffic allocation in the corridor.
In the case of a toll road project, an accurate estimate of the amount that the potential users
are ready to pay – the willingness to pay – is in theory a prerequisite of setting toll level. In
developing countries, the quick changes occurring in income distribution and overall wealth
make willingness to pay difficult to estimate over the periods of the economic appraisal.
Users’ willingness to pay tolls is largely a function of their income, the value they assign to
time savings and other toll road benefits, and the cost and quality of competitive
alternatives. Assessing willingness to pay is in fact trying to figure out the elasticity of
transport demand.
“Diversion-Ratio” Curve Analysis: The diversion ratio curve will be made by assessing
how toll charging will affect traffic demand. The diversion ratio curve is derived from the relation
between the toll amount charges, divided by the time saving resulting from using a toll road
instead of an existing toll-free road and the percentage of vehicles that will divert from the free
road to the toll road. These diversion ratio curves are calculated for each type of vehicle.
The time value for each type of vehicle can be obtained by calculation but should eventually
be based on experience. Time values and diversion ration curves will have to be revised
regularly in accordance with the actual traffic volume on toll roads as the years pass.
With the above considerations, the traffic forecast (including, generated, induced and
diverted traffic) may be made. Prior to arriving at a conclusion, the sensitivity of the forecast
traffic need to be tested for the assumptions built in the process.
3.2
APPRAISAL METHODOLOGY
3.2.1
Assumptions
The Expressway segments are part of the overall network of expressways and prima-
facie financially viable projects and meet the current regulations set by the Central
Government or the Authority established for the purpose. This preliminary viability,
presumed to consider the appropriate traffic forecast for the project duration.
3.2.2
Overview of the financial analysis process
The financial analysis includes the following steps to establish and understand a reasonable
likelihood of being financially viable:

Step 2
-
Assess the veracity of the traffic forecasts;
Step 3
-
Set up the financial model for use in analysis of the project or
prepare;
Step 4

Determine the annual toll revenues and all other relevant
revenues;
Step 5
-
Determine the project capital costs and other associated cost;
Step 6
-
Determine the project operating and maintenance costs base
assumptions for analysis
Step 7
-
Calculate key financial ratios;
Step 8
-
Perform risk and sensitivity analysis;
Step 9
-
Conclude on financial viability of the project.
Each of these steps, except the project scope and traffic forecast aspects which have
already been described in the preceding paragraphs are discussed hereunder.
Step 3: Set up the Financial Model
The new Model Concession Agreement (MCA) for Public Private Partnership (PPP) in
National Highways has been published by the Planning Commission in September 2006.
A similar MCA for Expressway network projects need to be developed and shall be
considered in Financial Analysis. The aspects which are generally considered are
(i) grant; (ii) concession fee; (iii) user fee; (iv) discounts (for frequent users and local non-
commercial users); and (v) concession period.
Step 4: Annual Toll Revenues and all other Relevant Revenues
Estimating the likely toll revenue to be earned by the toll road over a period of twenty five
years is an extremely important task. Sufficient data collection and analysis must be carried
out to ensure that reliance can be placed on the forecasts. The revenue estimation process
consists of the following steps:
Step 1
:
Define the toll influence area;
Step 2
:
Carry out traffic counts at a number of points within the toll influence
area, on significant adjoining roads;
Step 3
:
Conduct link specific Origin/Destination surveys of traffic in the toll
influence area;
Step 4
:
Estimate traffic growth over the concession period for each class
of vehicle;
Step 5
:
Estimate the time savings associated with the new facility;

Step 6
:
Develop a driver route choice model within the toll influence area,
for each class of vehicle;
Step 7
:
Estimate the tolls to be charged on the road over the concession
period  including provision for reductions and exemptions for some
classes of local traffic;
Step 8
:
Using the driver route choice model calibrated with the toll rates
and time savings, and the projected traffic in the toll influence area,
calculate gross and net revenues from the road.
a)
Revenue Estimation Process
i)
Definition of the Toll Influence Area
The toll influence area consists of those roads where the level of traffic
will be affected by the opening of the new expressway. Some traffic will
be attracted onto the new alignment because of the time savings
available, and some traffic will divert off the road to avoid tolls. A
necessary first step in determining the likely level of traffic on the new
alignment at different toll levels is to determine the existing level of traffic
on all roads, which is likely to divert to the expressway. Designers/planner
need to use their judgment as to what roads to consider, so that the
analysis includes all significant roads but avoids unnecessary complexity.
The roads included may change as the analysis progresses, based on
what is learnt about traffic behaviour.
ii) Estimate Traffic Growth and Assess Traffic Level
This aspect will primarily be based upon the traffic data for the entire project
life. Further processing or fine-tuning required during project preparation
stage shall be developed. The development of expressways not considered
in the planned network will have significant change in methodology.
iii) Estimate Time Savings
Where it may be possible for travelers to avoid the toll road by taking
alternative routes, it is necessary to calculate average travel times for each
class of vehicle on each alternative route with the differences in travel times
representing time savings associated with using the expressway.



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 528
======================================================================
I - 57
Chapter - 3 : Economic And Financial Viability Analysis
iv) Develop Driver Route Choice Model
Drivers make route choices based on the relative costs of alternative
routes. Costs include direct and indirect vehicle operating costs, tolls,
and the value of time. It is usually accepted that there is also an additional
value attributable to traveling on a new expressway.
A well-developed model of route choice will utilize econometric techniques
and data obtained from both revealed preference and stated preference
studies i.e. willingness to pay. The output of the model is expressed as a
probability that a vehicle of a particular class will use the toll road.
v) Tolling Options and Strategy
Maximum toll rates are set by legislation, and actual toll rates vary with
local conditions. Set toll rates based on best estimate that are likely to
be charged from the users of the road. Legislated toll rates (if mandatory)
may have to be used for each vehicle class, escalated over time using a
suitable escalation factor.
vi) Compute Toll Revenue
Based on tollable traffic and toll rates, the toll revenue can be assessed
with due credit to discounts applicable to specific traffic types. This may
involve a process of disaggregation/reduction in total tollable traffic.
vii) Revenue Streams
Net project revenues consist of, for each year of the project, gross revenue
less the costs of toll collection, other operation, management and
maintenance.
Step 5 : Project Capital Cost and Other Cost
For purposes of financial analysis all relevant project costs must be included in the equation.
That includes construction cost, if applicable any land acquisition, resettlement and relocation
costs, costs related to the shifting of utilities, as well as environmental mitigation costs and
costs for processing environmental approvals, costs for supervision and administration.
Financing charges, such as interest during construction, carrying charges for debt, etc, are



======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
automatically calculated by the financial model. It should be noted that in India, the aspects of
land acquisition, relocation and resettlement of affected individuals as well as shifting of utilities
is the responsibility of the government and hence excluded from overall project costs for the
purpose of financial model for BOT projects.  Nonetheless, this needs to be verified for each
project. Finally operations and maintenance costs of the roadway itself must be included in the
financial analysis, either as costs or as deductible from the toll revenues as cash inflow.
Step 6 : Project Operating and Maintenance Cost
Base Assumptions for Analysis
In practice, different approaches of estimating O&M cost are used. One approach is to
estimate the O&M costs as a percentage of the capital cost of the road. Another approach
is to use the knowledge and experience gained from constructed projects and development
in other countries. Overall, as in Japan, the O&M costs of expressways are twice as expensive
as those of the major National Highways – attributable to higher level of service provided.
The financial analysis should include as separate items routine maintenance, which would
be performed regularly throughout the year, and periodic maintenance, which consists of
larger works that would be performed perhaps every five years. It is important that the
maintenance costs reflect the expected cost profile over the entire life of the project or the
concession period as the case may be.
It may be noted that it is usual for a concessionaire to be required to transfer the road
back to the Government at the end of the concession period in a specified condition.
Provision should be made within maintenance cost for the cost of bringing the road to the
specified condition at the end of the concession period.
Step 7 : Key Financial Ratios
The financial model (spread sheet) automatically calculates project equity and IRR, and
the minimum and average debt service coverage ratio. These results, together with details
of the loan repayment schedule, are used to generate a measure of project financial viability.
Where the results appear unreasonable, the assumptions in the model should be checked
to ensure nothing has been entered incorrectly in the model.
Step 8 : Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
The financial analysis is based on forecasts of traffic growth and construction cost and
timing. These variables are included in the financial model at their most probable values.
Actual values may differ significantly from forecast values, depending on future events.



======================================================================

======================================================================
I - 59
Chapter - 3 : Economic And Financial Viability Analysis
A prudent investor will consider the effects of likely changes in key variables on the financial
viability of the project through sensitivity and risk analysis.
Sensitivity analysis shows to what extent the viability of a project is influenced by variations
in major parameters such as project cost, traffic forecasts and revenue assessments.
Risk analysis considers the probability that changes to major quantifiable variables will
actually occur.
In practice it is very difficult to be precise about the probability of future events. It is better to
present the results of the sensitivity and risk analysis separately. Where there is a clear risk
to financial viability, it will be necessary to consider whether there is any strategy that can be
used to ensure that the risk to the project does not eventuate. It may be possible to shelter
the project from the risk even if it is not possible to prevent the future event from happening.
i)
Sensitivity Analysis
The viability of projects is evaluated principally by reference to the project
internal rate of return (IRR). The sensitivity analysis is conducted by changing
key variables in the financial model one at a time, and noting the effect on IRR
of the change in that variable. Important variables that may be tested include:
-
Changes to construction cost. The amount of variation modeled should
be based on experience of similar projects. It might be thought necessary
to model variations of ± 20 percent. Higher percentage variations are
more likely to occur where there are significant unknowns related to the
construction, for example in bridge foundations.
-
Changes to construction timing. Adverse changes may result from such
factors as unfavourable weather conditions, delays in the land acquisition
process or labour disputes. Again, experience should be the guide as
to the likely range of variation in construction timing for similar projects.
-
Changes in base year traffic. Most highway projects are sensitive to
variation in traffic volumes, and there has been a history internationally of
over-optimistic traffic forecasts for toll roads, particularly where the
willingness to pay tolls has been over-estimated. It is preferable to consider
the specific characteristics of the road when deciding on the amount of
variation to model, rather than applying a standard percentage. For example,



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 528
======================================================================
I - 60
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
the traffic projections may indicate that significant truck traffic will feed into
the road from a new port facility, but there is a risk that the new port will not
be completed in originally stipulated time. In such a case, the sensitivity
modeled would be that of zero truck traffic emanating from the port.
-
Changes in traffic growth rates. Over time small variations in growth rates
can have large impacts on financial viability. One scenario that should be
modelled is what would happen if growth in traffic was equal to the historical
and expected growth rates in GDP for the state and for India. It is also
useful to check that the traffic volumes projected to occur say twenty years
from construction of the project are still within the capacity of the road.
-
Changes in O&M costs. Maintenance cost is partly a function of traffic
volumes and the weight of traffic using the road. Overloaded trucks can
cause accelerated wear on the road surface, necessitating sooner and
more frequent major maintenance works.
Sensitivity analysis should not be restricted to the above list, but should also include other
variables that the circumstances of the project and the professional experience indicate
may have significant impact on financial viability. The financial model generally computes
sensitivities for 20% variations in construction cost, O&M Cost, and Revenue. Other
sensitivities can be calculated by re-running the model with varied assumptions.
ii)
Defining Finance Related Risks
Risk analysis should be performed after the sensitivity analysis. Risk should
be evaluated qualitatively unless there is a robust methodology available to
meaningfully quantify certain identified risks. In the absence of this
methodology, risks may be classified into three categories:
-
Highly likely to occur;
-
Probable, neither highly likely nor highly unlikely to occur;
-
Highly unlikley to occur.
To be useful, sensitivity and risk analysis should not only identify the risk likely to occur on
project financial viability, but it should also provide some guide as to how to mitigate that
risk, and so ensure financial viability. For example, if the construction cost of a major
bridge is highly uncertain, it might be possible to separate the bridge from the project, or
to provide appropriate guarantees. Note that normally risk should be borne by the party



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 528
======================================================================
I - 61
Chapter - 3 : Economic And Financial Viability Analysis
best able to manage that risk; and in the case of construction risk, it would normally be the
constructor who bears that risk. However, where the risk is so that it threatens financial
viability of an otherwise attractive project, it may be appropriate to have some carefully
defined strategy of risk transfer and mitigation measure.
The results of the analysis can be presented in table format, as given in Table 3.01, using
illustrative data.
Step 9 : Financial Analysis Conclusions
The financial model generates an indication of the suitability of the project for different
financial structures. Therefore, one should interpret the results of the model in the light of
detailed knowledge of the characteristics of the project. Review the conclusions of the
model and satisfy that these are reasonable. Where a project is not suitable for BOT
without Government support, the exercise should vary the amount of support, up to the
current maximum of 40 percent of total project cost, to determine the minimum level of
support required to allow a BOT structure.
The analysis should provide detailed comments on the reasons for lack of financial viability,
and the reasons for significant sensitivities/risks to financial viability. Where appropriate,
remedies should be identified and suggested. For example, where a high cost bridge is

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.3
INTRODUCTION
Expressway network development under Public Private Partnership (PPP) as toll road
project necessarily relies more on Financial Analysis (commercial format) than Economic
Analysis. However, an economic analysis is carried out to appreciate the contribution of
the expressway network in improvement of transport network from regional as well as
national angle. Therefore, economic analysis needs to be considered for linkages with
National and Sectoral policies, including connectivity, regional development and
importance to the national economy.
3.3.1
Overall context appraisal
Any investment in transportation network brings about a variety of impacts, some of which
can be quantified and then valued in monetary terms, and others which cannot. Most cost
attributable to development/improvement of a transport network can be assessed to a
high degree of accuracy. However, the same cannot be said regarding benefits. Although
both quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits need to be identified, it is with those that
can be quantified and valued that the economic analysis in carried out. This approach is
also referred to as cost benefit analysis. The costs and benefits are quantified in monetary
values over a specified time period and the key indicators are computed in terms of
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV).
Economic analysis is undertaken at constant prices, that is, without allowing for the effects
of general inflation on costs or benefits, but incorporating projected relative price changes
for key items.
3.3.2
Traffic demand analysis and forecasting
Contrary to other NHDP projects, this Expressway network development process identifies
and quantifies the traffic generation over a given period of time under separate study. For
Economic analysis, traffic data is generally required in terms of Passenger Car Units
(PCU) whereas for Financial analysis, number and types of vehicles are required.

METHODOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Toll roads are essentially in commercial format and more on business approach including
profit making fund arrangement etc.
3.4.1
Inputs for economic appraisal
An expressway project should, ideally, be taken on consideration of analysis – regional/
national development is the key.  When there are wide discrepancies between prices
(tariffs, tolls, fees) and costs. However, the financial and economic analyses may not lead
to the same investment decision.
3.4.2
Identification, quantification and valuation of key economic costs and
benefits
There are basic steps for analyzing the economic viability of road projects.  These are:
•
Calculate the financial cost of each input separately and determine which
are valid as economic costs;
•
Identify other economic costs which may be excluded from the financial
costs;
•
Convert financial costs to economic costs using standard procedures,
•
Identify the economic benefits
•
Identify those benefits which can be quantified;
•
Assign values to the benefits wherever applicable; and
•
Compare the benefits with the costs to determine a rate of return on
investments
In highway economic analysis, the sum total of all costs associated with the construction,
operation and maintenance of the project is included. Economic costs are based on
financial costs but also include a number of costs which may not normally be included in
the financial analysis. The following is a brief list of costs which would be considered part
of the economic cost analysis:
•
civil works and supervision
•
land acquisition
•
resettlement and productive compensation costs
•
environmental costs including mitigation

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
•
road safety costs (usually part of the overall cost of construction)
•
road maintenance and traffic management costs
•
other costs as identified within the project scope
3.4.3
Determining economic costs
Economic costs are derived by using a standard conversion factor (SCF), usually equivalent
to the elimination of taxes, duties and subsidies from the financial costs. In most cases
the value would be between 80% and 90% of the financial cost (generally fixed by the
Planning Commission of India). The other method is of shadow pricing and it requires a
good database as well excellent judgment neither of which may be always available.
Therefore, determining the shadow price of an individual project is not practicable.
3.4.4
Determining economic benefits
Measuring the economic benefits of transport projects usually involves more complex
conceptual and practical problems than does measuring their economic costs. It involves
not only a comparison with the situation without the project, but also a comparison with the
next best alternative to make certain that the project is the best alternative. In terms of
roads there are a number of design options which may be taken into consideration –
each of which may have a different cost.
The quantification and valuation of economic benefits attributed to highway projects are
usually more difficult to Identify than its costs. This is due to a number of factors such as:
•
benefits form highway projects are varied in nature, some are considered
to be direct and can be relatively easily quantified while others, more indirect,
are more difficult to quantify. The indirect benefits such as improved
agricultural productivity, reduced transport costs, improved household
income, improved access to places of employment, education and health
care, are more difficult to quantify and value.
•
even some direct benefits are difficult to quantify such as time savings.
However, as is the case with VOC (Vehicle Operating Cost) calculations
there is now a reasonably large body of work which deals with time savings
and the related issues therein.
The most commonly used and widely accepted benefit deriving from road projects is
Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) savings. Others mostly subjective would include:



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 528
======================================================================
I - 65
Chapter - 3 : Economic And Financial Viability Analysis
•
time savings, for passengers who are traveling for business/economic
purposes;
•
savings due to reduced accidents, specifically fatalities;
•
maintenance cost savings;
•
increased agricultural productivity and value of goods sold;
•
increased GDP resulting from increased industrial productivity;
•
increased benefits resulting from tourist expenditures; and
•
other benefits as identified within the project scope
Although most of the above-noted costs can be identified, quantified and valued, the same
is not true of the benefits. Not all of these benefits exist for each project, and their relative
importance can differ markedly from project to project. However there are now tools and
techniques which have been developed to assist in the quantification and valuation of a
number of key benefits. In NHDP projects for purposes of determining VOC savings, the
use of HDM – 4 is a prerequisite. The next most important benefit is that of time saving,
followed by accident cost savings. Both time savings and accident cost savings, however,
are still considered to be in a preliminary stage of development although there is data
available in both cases, for India. Time savings, in particular, are included as a standard,
critical benefit in NHAI-sponsored projects. Finally, maintenance cost savings due to the
new or rehabilitated road are also included in the analysis.
3.4.5
Economic viability: procedures for evaluation
The economic analysis of highway projects is based on comparing benefits and costs in
the situation without the project with that which would occur with the project in place. The
without-project and with-project situations both have to be projected. Certain effects of a
project do not impose a cost or confer a benefit within the confines of the project itself and
therefore are excluded in the analysis of financial benefits and costs. However external
effects on consumers or other producers, such as environmental costs and benefits, are
included in an economic analysis.
Project outputs need to be separated into two categories. Some project outputs will
substitute for other outputs without the project. The rest of project outputs will add to total
supply. Project outputs that substitute for without-project supplies are valued at the cost
savings of not acquiring those alternative supplies. Project outputs that add to total supply
are valued through the willingness to pay of the users. The willingness to pay should take



======================================================================
PAGE 100 of 528
======================================================================
I - 66
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
into account any reduction in price brought about by the extra project supplies. Where a
project output consists of an intermediate good, its value can also be assessed through
the net economic value of extra productive activities generated as a result of the project.
The basic criteria for a projects analysis are: the expected economic net present value
(ENPV); the expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR); and the benefit cost (B/C)
ratio. For the project (or subproject) to be acceptable, the EIRR should equal to or exceed
the Economic Opportunity Cost of Capital (EOCC). Government of India – Planning
Commission fixes this rate around 12 percent in constant economic prices, depending
on the extent of unquantified net benefits associated with the project.
3.4.6
Environmental impact in economic analysis
The methodology of integrating the costs and benefits of environmental impacts into
economic analysis is still evolving. Therefore this type of evaluation should focus only on
projects where environmental impacts, both costs and benefits, are large, can be easily
identified and where these can be quantified and valued. There are basically three major
impacts that can occur. The first relates to human health and includes costs related to
death or illness; the second relates to human welfare and includes damage to property,
traffic congestion, changes in soil productivity or land use. The last relates to
environmental resources and includes impacts on coastal waters, freshwater eco-
systems, biodiversity, etc.
There are two distinct approaches to valuation: objective valuation based on technical
relationships between the environment and the damage quotient; and subjective valuation
assessments of possible damage expressed or revealed in market behaviour. Willingness
to pay is one of the valuation techniques for assessing benefits to environmental change.
3.4.7
Identification of non-quantifiable benefits or secondary benefits
Road projects may have a host of secondary benefits which are not fully reflected in the
economic cost-benefit analysis. The first relates to the contribution of projects to objectives
other than increases in national income and efficiency and are sometimes referred to as
intangible benefits. Projects may, for example, contribute to more effective national
integration, regional development, to greater self-sufficiency of the population, to a more
equitable distribution of income. In an economic analysis, the non-quantifiable benefits
need to be identified to allow for a broader overview of project benefits by the decision
makes.

The stepwise procedure indicating the key activities and their requirements is given
herewith together with Table 3.02 indicating the format for economic appraisal.
Step 1:
Project Definition
• Identify the project and define the scope of work clearly

• For road tolling, conduct tolling preference surveys (willingness to
pay surveys) to determine level of acceptance at specified toll
rates, and toll diversion surveys to determine the level of traffic
which would not materialize if tolls were applied.
Step 4:
Selection of Key Project Assumptions

roads;
• Estimate level of diverted traffic (as percent of normal traffic);
• Estimate level of generated traffic (as a percent of normal traffic);
• Conduct toll diversion analysis;
• Determine elasticity of demand;

• land acquisition costs from engineering and revenue department
estimates
• relocation and resettlement from social assessment
• environmental mitigation from environmental assessment

EXPRESSWAY CAPACITY
4.1
INTRODUCTION
How much traffic can a facility carry? This is one of the fundamental questions, designers
and traffic engineers have been facing since highways have been constructed. The term
‘‘capacity’’ has been used to quantify the traffic-carrying ability of transportation facilities.
The value of capacity is used when designing or rehabilitating highway facilities, to obtain
design elements such as the required number of lanes. It is also used in evaluating whether
an existing facility can handle the traffic demand expected in the future.
The definition and value for highway capacity have evolved over time. The Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM 2000) is the publication most often used to estimate capacity. The current
version of the HCM defines the capacity of a facility as ‘‘the maximum hourly rate at which
persons or vehicles reasonably can be expected to traverse a point or a uniform section
of a lane or roadway during a given time period, under prevailing roadway, traffic and
control conditions’’ (HCM 2000). Specific values for capacity are given for various types
of facilities. For example, for freeway facilities capacity values are given as 2,250
passenger cars per hour per lane (pc/hr/ln) for freeways with free-flow speeds of 88 km
per hour (kmph), and 2,400 pc/hr/ln when the free-flow speed is 120 kmph (ideal geometric
and traffic conditions).
The main objective of this chapter is to provide an understanding of highway capacity and
the factors that affect it, and to provide guidance on obtaining and using field values of
capacity. The next part of this chapter discusses the method of assessing Expressway
capacity on free flow segment between interchanges.  Next, it discusses capacity analysis
for an interchange since this forms the major hindrance so far as the expressway capacity
is concerned.
4.2
CAPACITY ANALYSIS
4.2.1
Indian scenario
Determination of Highway Capacity is a complex process including road and traffic
characteristics, the most important of which are (i) traffic homogeneity (ii) traffic control
devices and signals, iii) access control and side friction (traffic), (iv) Overloaded – leading

to slow moving commercial vehicles. MORTH under Research Programme entrusted IIT
Roorkee for development  of “Technically Appropriate Values of Design Services Volumes
and for Capacity Analysis of Multilane Highways for Traffic Flow in Indian Conditions”.
Subsequently, IIT Roorkee in May 2008 presented a paper on “Estimation of Capacity
and Design Service Volume for 4/6-Lane Highway” using Highway Capacity  Manual 2000
(HCM-2000).  While appreciating the paper, IIT Roorkee was requested to have on site
validation of the assumptions and the process is ongoing.
4.2.2
Expressway capacity terminology
Expressway capacity: The maximum sustained 15-min flow rate, expressed in passenger
cars per hour per lane, that can be accommodated by a uniform expressway segment
under prevailing traffic and roadway conditions in one direction of flow.
Traffic characteristics: Any characteristics of the traffic stream that may affect capacity,
free-flow speed, or operations, including the percentage composition of the traffic stream
by vehicle type and the familiarity of drivers with the expressway.
Roadway characteristics: The geometric characteristics of the expressway segment under
study, including the number and width of lanes, left shoulder lateral clearance, clearance
from the median edge, interchange spacing, horizontal and vertical alignment, and lane
configurations.
Free-flow speed (FFS): the mean speed of passenger cars that can be accommodated
under low to moderate flow rates on a uniform expressway segment under prevailing
roadway and traffic conditions.
Base conditions: An assumed set of roadway and traffic conditions used as a starting
point for computations of capacity and level of service (LOS)
Capacity analysis is based on expressway segments with uniform traffic and roadway
conditions. If any of the prevailing conditions change significantly, the capacity of the
segment and its operating conditions change as well. Therefore, each uniform segment
should be analyzed separately.
4.2.3
Flow characteristics
Traffic flow within basic expressway segments can vary highly depending on the conditions
constricting flow at upstream and downstream bottleneck locations. Bottlenecks can be



======================================================================
PAGE 109 of 528
======================================================================
I - 75
Chapter - 4 : Expressway Capacity
created by ramp merge and weaving segments, lane drops, maintenance and construction
activities, accidents, and objects in the roadway.
Traffic flow within a basic expressway segment can be categorized into three flow types:
under-saturated, queue discharge, and oversaturated. Each flow type is defined within
general speed-flow density ranges, and each represents different conditions on the
expressway.
Under-saturated
-
Traffic flow that is unaffected by upstream or downstream conditions.
Queue discharge
-
Traffic flow passed through a bottleneck and is accelerating back to the
FFS of the expressway.
Over-saturated
-
Traffic flow is influenced by the effects of downstream bottleneck.
4.2.4
Factors Affecting Free Flow Speed (FFS)
The FFS of an expressway depends on traffic and roadway conditions. These conditions
are described below.
-
Lane width
-
Lateral clearance
-
Number of lanes
-
Interchange density
-
Geometric design
Lane Width and Lateral Clearance
When lane widths are less than 3.6 m, drivers are forced to travel closer to one another
laterally than they would normally desire. Drivers tend to compensate for this by reducing
their travel speed.
The effect of restricted lateral clearance is similar. When objects are located too close to
the edge of the median and roadside lanes, drivers in these lanes will shy away from
them, positioning themselves further from the lane edge. This has the same effect as
narrow lanes, which force drivers closer together laterally. Drivers compensate by reducing



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 528
======================================================================
I - 76
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
their speed. The closeness of objects has been found to have a greater effect on drivers
in the leftmost travel lane than on those in the median lane. Drivers in the median lane
appear to be unaffected by lateral clearance when minimum clearance is 0.6 m, whereas
drivers in the left lane are affected when lateral clearance is less than 1.8 m
Number of Lanes
The number of lanes on an expressway segment influences FFS. As the number of lanes
increases, so does the opportunity for drivers to position themselves to avoid slower
moving traffic. In typical expressway driving, traffic tends to be distributed across lanes
according to speed. Traffic in the median lane typically moves faster than in the lane
adjacent to the left shoulder. Thus, a four-lane expressway (two lanes in each direction)
provides less opportunity for drivers to move around slower traffic than does an expressway
with 6, 8, or 10 lanes. Decreased manoeuvrability tends to reduce the average speed of
vehicles.
Interchange Density
Expressway segments with closely spaced interchanges, such as those in heavily
developed urban areas, operate at lower FFS than suburban or rural expressways where
interchanges are less frequent. The merging and weaving associated with interchanges
affect the speed of traffic. Speeds generally decrease with increasing frequency of
interchanges. The ideal average interchange spacing over a reasonably long section of
expressway is 3 (three) km or greater. The minimum average interchange spacing
considered possible over a substantial length of expressway is 4 (four) km.
Geometric Design
The design speed of the primary physical elements of an expressway can affect travel
speed. In particular, the horizontal and vertical alignments may contribute to the FFS of a
given expressway segment. If an expressway has significant horizontal or vertical curves,
the analyst is encouraged to determine FFS from field observations and field density.

The Peak Hour Factor is used to account for variations in flow within the peak hour. The

also states that congested facilities have larger values (0.95 is “typical”) than non-
congested (unsaturated) ones. Clearly, these factors can have a large impact on capacity.

= 1.5 for rural expressways in level terrain
= 2.5 for rural expressways in rolling terrain
= 4.5 for rural expressways in mountainous terrain
Adjustment Factor for Driver Population (fP)
For Urban Expressways, the driver population factor is set to 1.0 to indicate that drivers
are familiar with roadway and traffic conditions (by virtue of the fact that most of the traffic
is composed of commuters).On Rural Expressways, the factor is set to 0.975.
4.2.6
Level of service of the expressway
Once an appropriate design speed has been selected, the other basic defining elements
of the highway (i.e., the number of lanes and the basic configuration of junctions with other
highway facilities) can be determined through application of the concept of acceptable
peakhour level of service. Level of service is a grading system for amount of congestion,
using the letter A to represent the least amount of congestion and F to refer to the greatest
amount (forced flow conditions). For a comprehensive treatment of this topic, refer to the
Highway Capacity Manual’. Table 4.05 presents a brief description of the operating
characteristics associated with each level of service. For Expressways, Level B is
desirable and Level C is acceptable.

INTERCHANGE CAPACITY ANALYSIS
HCM-2000 in Chapter 24 and 25 explains the methodologies applicable for analyzing
capacity of an interchange. Broadly an interchange capacity analysis is controlled by the
operations facilities/capacities at ramp terminals. HCM-2000 presents ideas and concepts
relating to most of the interchange types. In absence of extensive database required for
the analysis, designer has to depend on subjective default values – either adopting from
the tabulated values in HCM-2000 or allocate from experience.
In Japan, the process has been simplified and based on their research and experience,
regression equations as well as charts have been developed to evaluate adequacy of the
ramp terminals. These ramp terminals may be on or off from the expressway.
4.3.1
Design capacity of rampway
Design traffic capacity of one-lane ramp shall be as under
1,200 pcu/h
-
design speed ≤ 50 km/h
1,500 pcu/h
-
design speed > 50 km/h
However, adjustment factor for heavy vehicles may be considered as per Table 4.08.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-I: PLANNING
Basically, the traffic capacity of connecting point (merging & diverging) is less than that of
ramp, so the traffic capacity of ramp is determined by the capacity of connecting point.
Therefore, if the design traffic volume is more than one-lane ramp capacity, consideration
to increase the traffic capacity of connecting point should be given first.
4.3.2
Ramp junction capacity
The traffic capacity of ramp junction is affected by design traffic volume on through lane,
traffic capacity of through lane and number of lane. The method followed Highway Capacity
Manual – methodology and validated for Japan Traffic Condition. In the process, the approach
was simplified.
The capacity of ramp (Vr : traffic capacity of connecting point) can be calculated by following
formula:
i)
1-lane on - ramp to 2-lane carriageway (2 x 2 configuration)
Vr  = 1.13 Vd-154-0.39Vf
Vr  = 2 Vd-0.39Vf
(Smaller value shall be adopted as Vr)
ii)
1-lane off - ramp from 2-lane carriageway (2 x 2 configuration)
Vr  = 1.92 Vd-317-0.66Vf
iii)
1-lane on - ramp to 3-lane carriageway (2 x 3 configuration) .....…(Fig. 4.01)
Vr  = Vd +120-0.244Vf
Vr  = 3 Vd -Vf
(Smaller value shall be adopted as Vr)
iv)
1-lane off - ramp from 3-lane carriageway (2 x 3 configuration) ……(Fig. 4.02)
Vr  = 2.11 Vd -203-0.488Vf

VOLUME – II: DESIGN
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The objective of the document Volume-II: Design is to assist the design engineer in project
preparation for the identified sections of “Expressway Design”.  These design standards
deal with geometric design of inter-city expressways located in open country outside the
built-up area.   The alignment may, however, pass through isolated small stretches of built-
up area as long as the basic character of the expressway as a whole does not change.
The standard is not directly applicable to the design of urban expressways.
IRC documents have limitations for use under the present context. This Volume is intended
to assist expressway planners/designers with the basic information on project preparation.
The contents of this document are necessarily illustrative. This document does not intend
to replace text books or other published commercially available documents.
 This document has been structured into 14 (fourteen) chapters as follows:
 Chapter – 1 : Geometric Design
Chapter – 2 : Interchange Design
Chapter – 3 : Embankment and Cutting
Chapter – 4 : Pavement Design
Chapter – 5 : Design of Structures
Chapter – 6 : Tunnels
Chapter – 7 : Drainage and Erosion Protection
Chapter – 8 : Safety Barriers
Chapter – 9 : Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
Chapter – 10 : Toll Plaza Design
Chapter – 11 : Service Areas
Chapter – 12 : Pick-up Bus Stops

Chapter – 13 : Lighting
Chapter – 14 : Noise Barriers
Chapter – 1: Geometric Design
This section describes primarily the salient aspects considered in alignment design with
specific importance for the high density, high speed access controlled expressways.  The
considerations involve Terrain Classification, Design speeds, Cross Sectional elements,
Safety barriers, Sight distance, Horizontal and Vertical alignment, Climbing lane,
Coordination of Horizontal and Vertical alignment, Lateral and Vertical clearances at
underpasses, safety barriers, signages and associated features.
•
Decision sight distance for avoidance manoeuvres has been considered.
The critical locations where it is desirable to provide Decision Sight Distance
are (i) Interchange and intersection locations and (ii) Wherever changes in
cross-sections occur such as toll plazas and lane drops areas demanding
concentration due to competing sources of information.
•
Radius beyond which no super elevation is required has been adopted
based on normal crossfall and friction value of 0.035.
•
Length of Horizontal Curve
The horizontal curve length at the centerline of the carriageway should not
be less than two times the transition curve where intersecting angle is not
less than 7 degree.
•
The Clothoid type transition curves have been considered for smooth
manoeuvring of a vehicle at high speed.
Chapter – 2: Interchange Design
The considerations involve Location planning, Spacing, Types and forms, Capacity,
Geometric design, Lane balance, Weaving sections, Exit and entrance terminals, Speed
changes lanes and Traffic dispersal Schemes.
For closed tolling system, trumpet type interchanges integrated with toll plazas are desirable
and have been deliberated.
As a general guide the following may be useful for preliminary design consideration of
interchanges spacing.

-
Between Cities – a spacing of 20 - 30 km would be desirable
-
City outskirt areas – a spacing of 15 - 25 km would be desirable
-
Urban areas – In areas of concentrated urban development where the
habitation and development is considerable: a spacing of   5 - 10 km would
be desirable
Chapter – 3: Embankment and Cutting
Structural design of embankement and cutting shall be as per relevant IRC documents.
Expressways are to be built in embankment or cutting or on long elevated structures.
Desirably, a minimum height of 3.5 m shall be considered to accommodate animals,
pedestrians, agricultural vehicles etc requiring a minimum vertical clearance of 3.0 m.
The Finished Road Levels (FRL) shall be finalized with this minimum value as datum.
Chapter – 4: Pavement Design
Structural design of pavements shall be as per relevant IRC documents. The three main
characteristics expected of an expressway pavement surface from the-user’s point of
view are i) Good riding quality (low roughness value); ii) Skid-resistance i.e. good “pavement
– tyre” friction during wet weather situation; and  iii) Absence or limitation of rutting on
wheel tracks.  These have been deliberated in the chapter.
Chapter – 5: Design of Structures
Structural design of structures shall be as per relevant IRC documents. An expressway
alignment would meet various hazards in the form of cross roads, railways, the rivers/
waterways, canals, and topographical features such as dips, gorges, valleys, lakes and
water bodies and other physical barriers.
Chapter – 6:  Tunnels
The classifications of tunnels have been adopted from NEXCO practices in Japan and
are based on traffic volume and length of tunnel. The standards for installation of the
emergency facilities according to this classification have also been adopted from the
same source. Tunnel emergency facilities are designed for mitigating damage in the event
of fire or accident which may occur in the tunnel.
Tunnel Cross Sections are designed based on safety considerations and cost
considerations. An efficient and effective water proofing and drainage system is required

in all road tunnels for removal of water from rainfall, seepage, tunnel washing operations,
vehicle drippings/spillage or fire-fighting operations. Ventilation in tunnels is to provide
fresh air so as to reduce the effect of contaminants so that they are within permissible
limits  during operation of expressway facility
Chapter – 7:  Drainage and Erosion Protection
Structural design of drainage and erosion protection shall be as per relevant IRC
documents. The considerations involve Road side drains, Median drains, Culverts and
cross drainage, Subsurface drainage, Subgrade drainage, Edge drain collector, Erosion
control measures, Existing drain and Rainwater harvesting and conservation.
Chapter – 8:  Safety Barriers
Barrier Acceptance Standards are generally in accordance with NCHRP Report 350.
 For the expressway, the barriers shall be provided for the entire length. However, a
crashworthy end treatment is considered essential near the Toll plaza and at Gore areas.
In addition this may also be required to protect bridge piers, utility poles and foundation of
overhead sign boards.
Chapter – 9:  Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
To provide adequate level of safety to high speed users of expressways long distance
visibility; large lettering and symbols; and short legends for quick comprehension are the
basic necessity.
Interchange exit numbering provides valuable information for the users of Expressway.
Interchange exit shall be guided in a consistent manner by traffic signs such as  advance
Guide sign, Exit direction sign and Gore sign.
The other considerations involve Rest area and general service, Toll plaza, Route Markers,
Distance marker, Regulatory signs, Cautionary Warning signs, Design, Pavement marking,
and Colour and material.
Chapter – 10:  Toll Plaza Design
This chapter deals with Toll System based on “Closed system with ticketing payment
mode”. The considerations involve Toll plaza elements such as lane width at toll booth, toll
plaza lane length and Utility Bridge/Tunnel, number of toll lanes, ETC systems, Management
and Operation facilities and Audit systems.

Chapter – 11:  Service Areas
For the expressway, the service areas shall be planned to be provided at intervals of 30
minutes to one hour drive, which corresponds to around 50 – 100 km spacing. The facility
previsions have been adopted from  “AASHTO – Guide for Development of Service Areas
on Major Arterials and Freeways – third edition” and NEXCO practices in Japan.
From security considerations, it is of prime consideration that service areas will be provided
near interchanges and at intermediate locations where the distance between successive
interchanges is more than 100 km.
Consideration for Physically challenged persons is mandatory for the facilities provided
on expressways.
Chapter – 12:  Pick-up Bus Stops
The expressway bus stops shall be located in the service area adjacent to local bus routes.
For a closed toll system of expressway, the basic philosophy of design is to provide layout
convenient for both local and expressway bus services and do not involve passing through
toll plaza.
Chapter – 13: Lighting
The primary purpose of warrants is to assist designers in evaluating locations or lighting
needs and selecting locations for installing. AASHTO - Warrants for expressway lighting
categories as (i) Continuous Expressway Lighting; (ii) Interchange Lighting – Complete
and Partial; (iii) Bridge Structures and Underpasses; and (iv) Special situations.
Lighting Standards has been adopted from CIE 180:2007 Road Transport Lighting for
Developing Countries.  Tunnel Lighting has been adopted from CIE 88:2004 Guide for
the Lighting of Road Tunnels and Underpasses.
Guidance facilities during night time comprise of interior/exterior illuminated signs, blinker
lights and delineators.
Glare reduction devices are required for reducing the headlight glare of opposing traffic
at night which may distract the drivers from driving tasks.
Chapter – 14: Noise Barriers
Noise Barrier shall be provided to protect sensitive land uses from expressway noise.
The considerations involve Placement, reduction effect, Design and Types of barriers.

GEOMETRIC DESIGN
1.1
DEFINITION AND SCOPE
This Guideline is mainly for Expressways planned as green field projects. For this purpose,
the Expressway is defined as an arterial highway for motorized traffic, with divided
carriageways for high speed travel, with full control of access and usually provided with
grade separators at location of intersections. Generally, only fast vehicles are allowed
access on expressways. Parking/standing, loading/unloading of goods and passengers
and pedestrians/animals are not permitted on these expressways. They are inter-city
highways located in open country outside the built up area.  The alignment may, however,
pass through isolated small stretches of built up area as long as the character of the
expressway as a whole does not change. This Guideline is not directly applicable to the
design of urban expressways.
1.2
TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION
Terrain is classified by the general slope of the country across the highway alignment for
which the criteria given in Table 1.01 shall be followed. While classifying the terrain, short
isolated stretches of varying terrain shall not be taken into consideration.
In this context for better appreciation during design process, a discussion on the definitions
as provided by other international agencies would be of help.
AASHTO 2004 and the HCM-94, HCM-2000 (USA) have classified the terrain in more
general terms but under the same nomenclature.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
AASHTO and Malaysian Geometric Design Standards defines the classification as follows:
Level Terrain: It is that condition where expressway sight distances, as governed by
both horizontal and vertical restrictions, are generally long or could be made so without
major expense of construction difficulty.
Rolling Terrain: It is that condition where the natural slopes consistently rise above and
fall below the road grade, and where occasional steep slopes offer some restriction to
normal horizontal and vertical roadway alignment.
Mountainous Terrain: It is that condition where longitudinal and transverse changes in
the elevation of the ground with respect to the road are abrupt and where benching and
side hill excavation are frequently needed to obtain acceptable horizontal and vertical
alignment.
The HCM definitions of the terrain related to vehicle operations and speeds, are as follows:
Level Terrain: It is any combination of grades and horizontal or vertical alignment that
permits heavy vehicles to maintain the same speed as passenger cars; this generally
includes short-grades of no more than 1 to 2 per cent.
Rolling Terrain: It is any combination of grades and horizontal or vertical alignment that
causes heavy vehicles to reduce their speeds substantially below those of passenger
cars, but does not cause vehicles to operate at crawl speeds for any significant length of
time.
“Crawl speed” is the maximum sustained speed which trucks can maintain on an extended
upgrade of a given per cent.
Mountainous Terrain:  It is any combination of grades and horizontal or vertical alignment
that causes heavy vehicles to operate at crawl speeds for significant distances or at
frequent intervals.
In the Road User Cost Study in India carried out by the Central Road Research Institute
(CRRI) for the purpose of speed studies, terrain was divided into the same three classes
i.e. plain, rolling and mountainous and classified based on rise/fall per km and the alignment

DESIGN SPEEDS
Design Speed is defined as the speed which determines the inter-relationship of every
element comprising the design of external and conditions of the road, which affects
the driving of a vehicle. When the weather is good and the traffic density is low, the
maximum speed can be maintained with safety and comfort, by an average driver.
The assumed design speed should be a logical one with respect to the topography,
the adjacent land use, and the operations for expressway. Every effort should be made
to use as high a design speed as practicable to attain a desired degree of safe mobility
and efficiency under the given constraints of environmental quality, economics and
social impacts.
Once selected, all the pertinent features (both longitudinal and cross sectional) of the
expressway should be related to the design speed for consistency and balanced
design. Ruling design values mentioned above should be used where feasible, but in
view of the numerous constraints encountered, minimum values should be recognised
and adopted.
Some features, such as curvature, superelevation and sight distance are directly related
and vary appreciably with design speeds.
Other features, such as widths of pavements and shoulders and clearances to walls and
railings and barriers, are not directly related to design speed but they affect vehicle speed
curvature as given in Table 1.02:
Table 1.02 Terrain – Rise/Fall and Curvature

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Short stretches (say less than 1 km) of varying terrain in the project stretch shall not be taken
into consideration while deciding the terrain classification for a given section of Expressway.
In general, the ruling design speed shall be adopted for geometric design of the highway.
Only in exceptional circumstances, minimum design speed may be adopted where site
conditions are extremely restrictive and adequate land width is not available. Abrupt
changes in design speed shall be avoided.
Ruling design speed shall be the guiding criteria for correlating the various geometric
design features. Minimum design speed may be adopted in sections where site conditions
including costs do not permit a design based on the Ruling design speed.
The design speed shall be uniform along the expressway. For those sections of expressway
where variations in terrain may make changes in speed unavoidable, the design speed
shall be changed in a gradual manner, by introducing sections of increasing/decreasing
design speed as the case may be.

1.4.2
Lane width
The recommendation of lane width for cross-sectional elements is an extremely complex
process. Several countries like USA, UK, France, Germany, Japan etc have carried out
lot of research and has estimated the effects in terms of safety and comfort of drivers.
There is no internationally consistent model of the simultaneous effects of lane width,
shoulder width and type on elevating comfort of drivers as well as the safety level.
But it has been widely accepted that wide lanes and shoulders (paved and earthen) provide
drivers increased opportunity for safe recovery when their vehicles run-off the road.
Therefore, it has remained largely subjective.
Wide carriageway lane widths provide sufficient sense of safety and lateral space to
maintain high speed driving for which the expressways are constructed.
The width of a lane for an expressway in plain and rolling terrains shall be 3.75 m, and in
mountainous terrain 3.50 m.
Where the lane width changes e.g. from 3.50 m to 3.75 m or vice versa, the transition shall
be effected through a taper of 1 in 60 or flatter.
1.4.3
Edge strip width
Technically edge strip is part of carriageway but functionally it may not be considered as
part of carriageway. They are widely adopted in Europe and Japan, but not common in
USA. Edge strips should provide lateral support to the carriageway proper and will also
accommodate the edge markings.
The width of edge strip [Fig. 1.03, 1.04 and 1.05A and 1.05B] shall be as given in Table 1.06.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Edge strip shall be provided on both sides of each carriageway so as to enhance the
delineation effect to drivers and to constitute a part of lateral clearance for the safety of
vehicles.  Edge strip shall also accommodate the edge markings.
Edge strip shall have the same pavement crust and camber as that of the carriageway.
Location of safety barrier on outer side, is shown in Fig. 1.03.
1.4.4
Shoulder width
A shoulder is the portion of the roadway contiguous with the carriageway. Well-designed
and properly maintained shoulders are necessary and the important advantages derived
are:
i)
Space is provided for stopping of vehicle and make the through traffic lane
free from obstruction because of mechanical difficulty, a flat tyre, or other
emergency;
ii)
Space is provided for the occasional driver who is required to stop, to decide
road ramps, service areas, or for other reasons;
iii)
Space is provided to escape potential accidents or reduce their severity;
iv)
The sense of openness created by shoulders of adequate width contributes
much to driving ease and freedom from strain;
v)
Sight distance is improved in cut sections, thereby improving safety;
vi)
Expressway capacity level is maintained and uniform speed is encouraged;
vii) Lateral clearance is provided for signs and guardrails;
viii) Surface run-off can be discharged further from the carriageway, and
seepage adjacent to the carriageway can be minimized. This reduces
pavement edge fretting;
ix)
Structural support is given to the pavement;
x)
Space is provided for maintenance, operation and security.
Desirably, a vehicle stopping on the shoulder should clear the pavement edge by at least
0.3 m, preferably by 0.6 m. This preference has led to the adoption of 3.0 m as the normal
shoulder width that should be provided along the expressway for plain and rolling terrain.
For mountainous terrain paved shoulder width may be reduced to 2.5 m as given in the
Table 1.07.

Paved shoulder is not necessary on the median side.   However, in the
case of split level carriageways (carriageways at different levels), median
side paved shoulder shall be of 1.75 m width. (Fig.1.04)
ii)
The width of verge on the outer side (i.e., towards the embankment slope)
shall be minimum 1.5 m. This verge shall provide lateral support to the paved
shoulder and provide space to accommodate safety barrier, signs, open
drain, etc. (Fig. 1.06).
1.4.5
Median width
Median
Where traffic lanes in opposite directions are separated laterally, the road cross-section
between opposing traffic lanes is referred to as the median.
The median width is expressed as the dimension between the through traffic lanes including
the paved/hard shoulder.  The principal functions of a median are:
•
To separate the opposing traffic
•
To provide a recovery area for out-of-control vehicles
The earthen shoulder provides lateral support to the paved shoulder and provides space
for foundation of safety barriers, road signs and other road appurtenances and utility poles.
This also provides additional space for errant vehicle to manoeuvre and return back to
driving lane. This earthen shoulder needs to be protected against erosion with adequate
non-eroding cross slopes and turfing or other measures as applicable and decided by
the designer.
The width of paved shoulders on left (outer) side for different terrains shall be as given in
Table 1.07.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
•
To provide a stopping area in case of emergencies,
•
To minimize head light glare, stoppage for right turn and U-turn vehicles
Median should be as wide as feasible. In any case, the median width should be in balance
with the other cross sectional elements and the character of the area.
AASHTO Road side design guide 1996 and updated 2006 have the following
recommendation in respect of median barriers on high-speed, fully access controlled
roadways :
•
For median width up to 10 m – Barrier is recommended
•
For median width between 10 and 15 m – Barrier is optional
•
For median width of more than 15 m – Barrier is not normally considered
For the situations requiring restricted median width, barrier need to be considered.
The minimum width of median is dependent upon the maximum lateral deflection
that a barrier system experiences during impact which can vary from 0-3 m.
Minimum deflection is experienced by rigid concrete barriers and maximum by
flexible cable type barriers.
Wide medians offer scope for future widening of the carriageway on the median side
without disturbing paved shoulder or side slope protection.
Median Width
A physical hurdle may be ensured by providing shrubs to prevent vehicles from attempting
to cross over.
As far as possible, the median shall be of uniform width in a particular section of the
expressway. Wherever changes occur in median width, transition shall be effected through
a taper of 1 in 60.
Median opening with detachable barrier shall be provided for traffic management
for maintenance works and removal of vehicles involved in accidents. Such barriers
shall be located before and after tunnels, interchanges, and rest areas. It is
desirable to provide median opening with detachable barriers at every 2 to 5 km
spacing.
Length of Median Opening shall be not less than 20 m (for emergency and for
repair/ maintenance works).  Detachable guard barrier shall be provided at every
opening.

Desirable – 8.0 m
(to accommodate structure/pier on median)
•
For future widening
Minimum – 12.0 m
Desirable – 15.5 m
(to also accommodate structure/pier)
Depressed medians are the recommended configuration on expressways, the
recommended crossfall shall be 1 in 8 but can be 1 in 6 on narrow median and can be
1 in 4 to meet the highest amount of overlay (Pavement Thickness).
Raised medians with mountable kerbs may have to be provided in curves where super
elevation is to be provided.  Appropriate railings/crash barriers shall be provided.
Paving of narrow medians helps maintenance and may also be adopted in difficult climatic
conditions which do not permit grassing/turfing.  Wider medians should be turfed and
lightly planted, using species which might not cause interference with water-balance in
the pavement-subgrade system.
Flush medians when used on expressways, a median barrier may be required.
The median should be slightly crowned or depressed for drainage. In warmer
climates, the crowned type is frequently used because it eliminates the need for
collecting drainage water in the median. However, the slightly depressed type is
generally preferred with a cross slope of about 4 percent or with a minor steepening
of the roadway cross slope.
Typical median treatment is shown in Fig. 1.06A.

considerations are:

Median Opening
Median openings on expressways are provided for emergency use.  These openings,
also known as Emergency Crossing Points (ECP’s), are generally meant for repair/
maintenance works, traffic control and other emergency services such as fire, accidents
etc.  Normally these should be closed by a removable safety fence where normal
traffic is not allowed to use these facilities.
Median openings shall be provided for emergency and for repair/maintenance works with
detachable crash barriers at every 2.5 km spacing.

Crossfall/camber
The crossfall on the expressway section shall be as given in Table 1.08. Each
carriageway shall have unidirectional crossfall. The rate of cross slope on curves as
well as on tangent alignment is an important aspect in cross-section design. A
reasonably steep lateral slope is desirable to minimize water ponding on non-kerbed
pavements with flat longitudinal profile grades as a result of pavement imperfections
or unequal settlement.

General
The height of the embankment shall be based on the final carriageway levels. The following
principles shall be followed:
i)
The vertical clearance requirement of the cross roads and in addition,
considering that the top of the subgrade of the cross road pavements is at
least 1.0 m above the high flood level/high water table/pond level.
ii)

way, shall be provided on rural Expressways. Embankment slope shall not be steeper than
1V: 2H. Slopes of 1V:4H or flatter are desirable for embankments of moderate height
(Fig. 1.07). For high embankments, steeper slopes protected by safety barriers may be
needed (Fig. 1.03).  For embankment heights more than 6.0 m slope stability of the
embankment will dictate the side slopes.  The stability analysis shall follow IRC:75 - Guidelines
for the Design of High Embankments.
1.4.7.4
Cut slope
Generally the slope is decided by the stability and erosion prevention consideration
and the soil/rock formation through which the road passes.

Visibility shall be greater than the Safe Stopping Distance throughout the expressway.
As per IRC: 73 for all sight distance calculations, the height of the driver’s eye is assumed
to be 1.2 m above the road surface. For stopping sight distance calculations, the height of
object is assumed to be 0.15 m above the road surface.
Calculation of Stopping Sight Distance
Sight distance is the length of roadway ahead visible to the driver. The minimum sight
distance available on a roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle travelling
at or near the design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path.
Stopping sight distance is the sum of two distances; the distance traversed by the vehicle
from the instant the driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes
are applied and the distance required to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application
begins. These are referred to as brake reaction distance and braking distance,
respectively.
The stopping sight distance is computed by the use of the standard equation:

braking distance. Substituting t=2.5s, g=9.8 m/s2, into the above equation, stopping sight

In which G is the grade expressed as a decimal and the other terms are as previously
stated. The safe stopping distances on upgrades are shorter; those on downgrades are
longer. However, G is usually very small compared to f and thus, the effect of G is negligible.
Also, sufficient margin is included in reaction time. Consequently, it is not necessary to
take the effect of grade into consideration in calculation of stopping sight distance.
1.6.2
Decision sight distance
Decision sight distance is defined as the distance required for a driver to detect an unexpected
or otherwise difficult to perceive information source or hazard, recognize the hazard or its
threat potential, select an appropriate speed and path, initiate and complete the required
manoeuvre safely and efficiently. The values of decision sight distances are greater than the
stopping sight distances.  It gives the driver sufficient distance to complete his manoeuvre at
the same or reduced speed without having to stop. The values of decision sight distance are
given in Table 1.10.  These can be used at critical locations indicated below:
The critical locations where it is desirable to provide Decision Sight Distance are:
a)
Interchange and intersection locations
b)
Wherever changes in cross-sections occur such as toll plazas and lane drops
c)
Areas demanding concentration due to competing sources of information,
such as roadway elements, traffic and traffic control devices.
If it is not possible to provide these distances because of difficult horizontal or vertical
alignment, consideration shall be given to relocating those points. If it is not possible to
relocate, adequate advance warning/traffic control devices, shall be ensured.
The criteria for measuring the Decision Sight Distance as above are:
i)
the driver’s eye height at 1.2 m above the road surface; and
ii)
the object’s height of 0.15 m above the road surface.
The Decision Sight Distance shall be checked at the centre of concerned lane.

HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
1.7.1
General
The following general principles shall be kept in view while designing the horizontal alignment:
i)
Alignment should be fluent and blend well with the surrounding topography.
ii)
The curves should be designed to have largest practical radius but in no
case less than ruling value corresponding to ruling design speed.
iii)
Sudden change of alignment, for example, sharp curve  at the end of long
tangent section shall be avoided, since these can be extremely hazardous.
iv)
Long tangent sections exceeding 3 km in length shall be avoided as far as
possible.  A curvilinear alignment with long curves is better from the point of
safety and aesthetics.
v)
The curves shall be sufficiently long, and have suitable transitions to provide
pleasing appearance.
vi)
Reverse curves may be needed in difficult terrain.  Sufficient length between
two curves shall be provided for introduction of requisite transition curves,
and required superelevation.
vii) The curves in the same direction separated by short tangents known as
broken back curves should be avoided as far as possible in the interest of
aesthetics and safety. Wherever possible, such portion may be designed
with longer single curve.
viii) Sharp curves shall not be provided in high embankment section.  If this is
not possible, proper delineation/safety barriers must be provided.
ix)
To avoid distortion in appearance, the horizontal alignment should be
coordinated carefully with the vertical alignment.
1.7.2
Horizontal curves
In general horizontal curves shall consist of a circular portion flanked by spiral transitions
at both ends.

The desirable radius of horizontal curve is calculated assuming the friction developed as
50 percent of the values given in Table 1.11.  For other superelevation values (e) may be
worked out.
Japanese experience testifies that there is not much difference in cost of construction using
desirable radius and the absolute minimum radius curves.   However, in most cases an
alignment can be drawn with curves larger than the desirable radius as mentioned above.
1.7.2.2
Radii beyond which no superelevation is required
Table 1.13 shows the radii of the horizontal curves beyond which super elevation will not
be required (assuming f=0.035). In such cases, the normal cambered section shall be
continued on the curved portion without providing any superelevation.
           Table 1.13 Radii Beyond which Superelevation is not Required
e= super elevation ratio in metre per metre

equation.  A typical value for e=7%  is given in Table 1.12.

1.7.2.3
Length of horizontal curve
The curve length at the centreline of carriageway should not be less than two times the
transition curve length in case the intersecting angle is more than 7 degrees.  When the
intersecting angle is less than 7 degrees, the length of curve should not be less than the
desirable value given in Table 1.14.   However, in unavoidable cases, the value may be
reduced to the minimum value regardless of the intersection angle.
where Δ is the total deviation angle between straight alignments.
When a vehicle runs on a short curve section of the road, the driver and passengers
undergo a horizontal impact and are exposed to danger particularly while on an expressway
because of need for frequent steering. Where the radius of curve is relatively large,
theoretically a relatively short curve is enough for centrifugal acceleration. However, in
such a case, if the intersection angle is small, a driver feels that the curve length is shorter
and the radius of curve is smaller than actual values, causing the driver to reduce speed.
If the driver tries to run his vehicle without decreasing speed, the vehicle will run along a
larger radius and may enter other lanes and cause collision.
To be on safe side, the minimum curve length shall be the length that a vehicle runs for
6 seconds, because it requires at least 3 seconds for the driver to steer one direction,
so the minimum length of curve shall be the length that a vehicle runs for two times of
3 seconds.
1.7.2.4
Setback distance at horizontal curves
Requisite stopping sight distance shall be available across the inside of horizontal curves.
Lack of visibility in the lateral direction may arise due to obstructions like walls, cut

slopes, buildings, wooded areas, tall farm crops etc. Distance from the road centre line
within which the obstructions shall be cleared to ensure the needed visibility, i.e. the set
back distance, can be calculated vide procedure described below. But in certain cases
due to variations in alignment, road cross section, and the type and location of
obstruction, it may become necessary to resort to field measurements to determine the
limits of clearance.
The set-back distance is calculated from the following equation:
m=R-(R-n) Cos è                                                                               (Fig 1.09)
è
m = the minimum set back distance to sight obstruction in metres (measured from the
centre line of the road);
R = radius at centre line of the road in m
n = distance between the centre line of the road and the centre line of the inside lane in
m; and S=sight distance in m
In the above equation, sight distance is measured along the middle of inner lane.
Where there are sight obstructions (such as walls, cut slopes, buildings, or a guardrail
under certain conditions) on the inside of curves, a design to provide adequate
sight distance may require adjustment in the normal expressway cross section or
change in alignment if the obstruction cannot be removed. Using design speed and
a selected sight distance as a control, the designer should check the actual condition
and make the necessary adjustments in the manner most fitting to provide adequate
sight distance.
For general use in design of a horizontal curve, the sight line is a chord of curve, and the
applicable stopping sight distance is measured along the centre line of the inside lane
around the curve.

Attaining superelevation
The normal cambered section is changed into superelevated section in two stages. First
stage is the removal of adverse camber in outer half of the pavement. In the second stage,
superelevation is gradually built up over the full width of the carriageway so that required
superelevation is available at the beginning of the circular curve. Fig. 1.10 Illustrates the
method diagrammatically. The small cross-sections at the bottom of each diagram indicate
the pavement cross slope condition at different points.
The superelevation shall be attained gradually over the full length of the transition curve so
that the design superelevation is available at the starting point of the circular portion. In
developing the required super elevation, it shall be ensured that the super elevation run-
off rate (i.e. the rate of change of super elevation) is not steeper than 1 in 200 for roads in
plain and rolling terrains and 1 in 150 for roads in mountainous-terrain.
For expressways with divided carriageways the points of rotation are generally considered
at the junction of carriageway edge and the median.
The median is held in a horizontal plane and the two carriageways are rotated separately
around the median edges to superelevate the roadway. Expressways warrant a greater
attention to appearance. Accordingly the values for length of runoff should be considered
as minimum, and the adoption of yet longer values is desirable.
When cross-drainage structures fall on a horizontal curve, their deck should be
superelevated in the same manner as described above.
1.7.4
Transition curves
Generally, the Euler spiral, which is also known as the clothoid, is used in the design of
spriral transition curves. The radius varies from infinity at the tangent end of the spiral to
the radius of the circular arc at the end that meets the circular arc.  By definition, the
radius of curvature at any point on an Euler spiral varies inversely with the distance
measured along the spiral. When a driver keeps constant speed and turns the steering
wheel with constant angular velocity, its tire track draws spiral, which is called clothoid.
Clothoid curves give smooth manoeuvring of a vehicle which is especially important for
a high speed driving.

PAGE 199 of 528
======================================================================

Geometric Design
The principal advantages of transition curves in horizontal alignment are as follows:
-
A properly designed transition curve provides a natural, easy-to-follow path for
drivers, such that the lateral force increases and decreases gradually as a
vehicle enters and leaves a circular curve. Transition curves minimize
encroachment on adjoining traffic lanes and tend to promote uniformity in speed.
A spiral transition curve simulates the natural turning path of the vehicles.
-
The transition curve length provides a suitable location for the superelevation
runoff. The transition from the normal pavement cross slope on the tangent to
Length of transition shall be the greater of the three values derived from the following criteria:
a)
Rate of change of centrifugal acceleration

V= speed in km/h
R= radius of circular curve in metres
V
C

= 75

 (subject to a maximum of 0.6 and minimum of 0.4)
b)

The rate of change of super elevation or run off shall not be steeper than 1 in
200 (0.5 percent) for roads in plain and rolling terrain and 1 in 150 for roads
in mountainous terrain.
c)
Three seconds time for manipulating the steering. The minimum lengths of
transition curves for this criteria is as in Table 1.15

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
the fully superelevated section on the curve can be accomplished along the
length of the transition curve in a manner that closely fits the speed-radius
relationship for vehicles traversing the transition. Where superelevation runoff
is introduced without a transition curve, usually partly on the curve and partly
on the tangent, the driver approaching the curve may have to steer opposite
to the direction of the approaching curve when on the superelevated tangent
portion in order to keep the vehicle within its lane.
-
A spiral transition curve also facilitates the transition in width where the
travelled way is widened on a circular curve. Use of spiral transitions provides
flexibility in accomplishing the widening of sharp curves.
-
The appearance of the expressway is enhanced by the application of spiral
transition curves. The use of spiral transitions avoids noticeable breaks in the
alignment as perceived by drivers at the beginning and end of circular curves.

to that specified in Table 1.16.

VERTICAL ALIGNMENT

General
The design should follow the vertical alignment as indicated below unless modification is
required to meet the specific provisions or additional features/facilities to be provided as

the vertical alignment:
The vertical alignment shall provide for a smooth longitudinal profile consistent with the
terrain. Grade changes shall not be too frequent as to cause kinks and visual discontinuities
in the profile. Desirably there shall be no change in grade within a distance of 150 m.
A short valley curve within an otherwise continuous profile is undesirable since this tends
to distort the perspective view and can be hazardous.
Broken-back grade lines, i.e. two vertical curves in the same direction separated by a short
tangent, shall be avoided due to poor appearance and shall be replaced by a single long curve.
Decks of small cross drainage structure (i.e. culverts or minor bridges) shall follow the
same profile as the flanking road section, without any break in the grade line.
The vertical alignment shall be coordinated with the horizontal alignment as discussed in
Section 1.10.
i)
Gradients up to the value corresponding to ruling gradient shall be adopted
as far as possible. Value corresponding to limiting gradient shall be adopted
only in very difficult situations and for short lengths.
ii)
Long sweeping vertical curves shall be provided at all grade changes. These
shall be designed as square parabolas.
iii)
The vertical profile of the two carriageways shall be designed in such a
manner that difference in road level between the two carriageways at the
locations of median openings would not be more than 0.25 m.
iv)
The aspect of efficient drainage shall also be kept into consideration while
designing vertical profile and cross-sections of the highway as stipulated in
IRC: SP: 42 and IRC: SP: 50.
1.8.2
Gradients
i)
The maximum gradients shall be as indicated in Table 1.17:

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The absolute maximum gradient may be 1 percent steeper than the value shown above and
may be provided in mountainous terrain or in urban area with crucial right of way control.
ii)
Minimum gradient for drainage
On embankments, near level grades are not objectionable when the pavement has sufficient
camber to drain the storm water laterally.  However, in cut-sections, minimum gradient for
drainage considerations is 0.5 percent (1 in 200) if the side drains are lined and
1.0 percent (1 in 100) if these are unlined.
1.8.3
Vertical curves
Summit curves and Valley curves shall be designed as square parabolas. The length of the
vertical curve is controlled by sight distance requirements, but curves with greater length are
aesthetically better and shall be provided where possible. The minimum grade change
requiring vertical curve and the minimum length of vertical curve shall be as in Table 1.18.

CLIMBING LANE
Climbing lanes are normally not required for Expressways having a divided carriageway
with two or more lanes on each carriageway.  However, considering the presence of large
number of truck traffic as prevalent in India, for free and safe movement of traffic on sections
having up-gradient, the desirability of providing climbing lanes may be examined depending
on the volume of traffic including the percentage of truck traffic, designs surveys volume
and cost of the project.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The requirement of climbing lane needs to be examined if
•
the length of the section exceeds 2 km/1 km/500 m for upgradients of
3 percent, 4 percent, and 5 percent or more respectively
•
the service volume  in the section on gradient, exceeds that for the next
poor level of service from that used for the design of the Expressway, and in
any case, not exceeding level of service D
The width of the climbing lane shall be 3.5 m. The climbing lane is to be provided on the
left side of the carriageway, i.e., on the shoulder side. The full width of the climbing lane
shall be provided from the cross-section where the gradient becomes 3 percent or more
and preceded by a tapered length 150 m. The full width of climbing lane shall be maintained
upto a length of 400 m ahead of the cross-section where the gradient becomes 2 percent
or less, followed by a tapered length of 150 m.

COORDINATION OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
The overall appearance of an expressway can be enhanced considerably by judicious
combination of the horizontal and vertical alignments.  Plan and profile of the road shall
not be designed independently but in unison, so as to produce an appropriate three-
dimensional effect.  Proper co-ordination in this respect will ensure safety, improve utility
of the expressway and contribute to overall aesthetics.
The degree of curvature shall be in proper balance with the gradients. Straight alignment
or flat horizontal curves at the expense of steep or long grades, or excessive curvature in
a road with flat grades, do not constitute balanced design and shall be avoided.
Vertical curvature superimposed upon horizontal curvature gives a pleasing effect.  As
such the vertical and horizontal curves shall coincide as far as possible and their length
shall be more or less equal. If this is difficult for any reason, the horizontal curve shall be
somewhat longer than the vertical curve.  Short vertical curve superimposed on long
horizontal curve and vice versa gives distorted appearance and shall be avoided.
Sharp horizontal curves shall be avoided at or near the apex of pronounced summit / sag
vertical curves from safety considerations.

alignment coordination. Fig. 1.10A shown the Illustrating Good Alignment Coordination.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL ALIGNMENT
1.11.1
Design approach
The essential form of expressways expresses their function, which is to move people and
goods safely and rapidly from one place to another. Expressways should have a pleasing
appearance, and they should fit gracefully into their surroundings and become acceptable
components of the landscape as viewed from outside the expressways. The coordination
or proper fitting together of the horizontal and vertical alignments and the cross-section is
an important technique for achieving an aesthetically pleasing expressways design.
The design of a road may consist of individual elements, the combination of the
horizontal alignment (plan) and the vertical alignment (profile) that results in a spatial
or three-dimensional creation. The resulting driving space can be described in its
sequence with the concept of road characteristics. It includes all of the structural
elements and determines the driving behaviour of the driver. Road characteristics
should not be greatly changed much over short roadway sections. A consistent
sequence of images of the driving space should be balanced in relation to the design
parameters among themselves (relation design). Different roadway sections should
be connected by gradual transitions.
The goal of the following recommendations is to produce the best alignment that provides
optimum safety and the traffic quality. Well-balanced road sections, in which each single
design element contributes to a good road characteristic, should be created. Well-
balanced sections eliminate unsafe feelings and driver discomfort. With the use of these
recommendations, the designer will be able to recognize and evaluate preliminary road
designs that result from superimposing selected horizontal and vertical design elements.
In this way, the designer can create three-dimensional design elements that achieve
perceptible, sound road characteristics.
Thus, in the design of expressway alignments, horizontal and vertical design elements
are necessarily superimposed. Combining the cross-section of the road, which includes
shoulders, pavement width, and pavement lane and edge markings, with horizontal and
vertical design elements results in a three-dimensional design element. The design of
any road is made up of a series or a sequence of three-dimensional design elements.
Typical three-dimensional design elements are shown in Fig. 1.11.

1.11.2
Horizontal design elements
Tangents: Long tangent sections of expressways are monotonous and fatiguing. They
can lead the driver into traveling at excessive speeds and increase the danger from
headlight glare at night. Therefore, long tangents with constant grades must be avoided,
and the maximum length should be limited to numerical value, in meters, of approximately
20 times the design speed, in kilometers per hour. (Source: Vic Roads Australia)
The unfavorable impression caused by long tangents in mountainous topography can be
reduced by the use of a sag vertical curve with a long length and large radius.
Short tangent segments between two horizontal curves in the same direction should be
avoided (Fig. 1.12a). If such designs cannot be eliminated, it is important that a minimum
length be used between the two curves. The minimum length of the tangent segment should
correspond to a numerical value, in meters, of approximately 6 times the design speed, in
kilometers per hour, to maintain consistency of the optical guidance.
Curves: Short circular curves between tangents appear as optical brakes from the
perspective view of the driver. Such an optical break can be avoided (Fig. 1.12b and
1.12c ) by connecting the two tangents with a long horizontal curve.
1.11.3
Vertical design elements
Tangents: The tangent in profile is a segment with constant grade. With respect to the
three-dimensional alignment, this part of the alignment is not critical.
A short tangent used between two succeeding sag vertical curves can give the impression
of a crest vertical curve (Fig. 1.12d) and should be avoided. A better solution, using a long
sag vertical curve, is shown in Fig. 1.12e. The same is true for a short tangent between
two succeeding crest vertical curves. Such a design may give the impression of a sag
vertical curve (Fig. 1.12f) and should be avoided. A better solution, using a long crest
vertical curve, is shown in Fig. 1.12g. In addition, the greater the distance a driver can see
ahead on the road, the longer a sag vertical curve should be to eliminate visual breaks.
Sag Vertical Curves: The sag vertical curve is the three-dimensional design element
with the best visual qualities and optical guidance. However, there is one exception: the
use of a short sag vertical curve between long sections with constant grades should be
avoided. In this case, it does not matter whether the horizontal alignment is on a tangent



======================================================================
PAGE 212 of 528
======================================================================
II - 52
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
section or on a curve (Fig. 1.13a and Fig. 1.13b respectively). In both cases, a visual
break in the perspective view occurs. The length of sag vertical curves on embankments
usually can be increased considerably notwithstanding the situation that it will result in
expensive earthwork.
Crest Vertical Curves: The crest vertical curve represents the most critical design
element when considering good visual qualities. The influence of a crest vertical curve
is especially critical with short lengths that cause insufficient sight distances (Fig.
1.13c). Crest vertical curves with minimum stopping sight distances should be avoided
on the mainline roadway if possible. The main consideration in using longer lengths is
earthwork costs. With the availability of user-friendly earthwork programs and the
perspective plot capabilities with the programs, it is now easy to design and test
many alternative profiles.
Consequences: On main rodway sections, visual breaks that are the result of short
horizontal and vertical curves or their combination should be avoided. Instead, strive to
use longer design elements. Short curves lead to inconsistencies at the roaway’s edge.
These statements are better understood by comparing Fig.1.12a and Fig.1.12b (poor
soluction) with Fig.1.12c (good solution and Figs. 1.12d and 1.12e (poor solution) with
Figs. 1.12f and 1.12g (good solution). In addition, Fig. 1.13b and 1.13c also show designs
that should be avoided.
The following should also be avoided :
•
Diving: The partial disapperance of the road from the driver’s view with
reappearance in the extension of the just-passed roadway section (Fig.
1.13d).
•
Jumpint: Similar to diving but with displaced reappearance (Fig. 1.13e).
•
Fluttering: Multiple diving or a rapidly rolling profile (Fig. 1.13f).
•
Broken-back vertical curve: A short tangent section between two sag vertical
curves(Fig. 1.12d).
Most of these designs may lead to critical driving manoeuvres because of visual
misconceptions, since portions of the alignments become hidden from the driver’s view,
which may, in turn, mislead the driver about the course of the roadway and opposing traffic.
These visual misconceptins are especially dangerous in the case of passing manoeuvres.

1.12.3
Cattle crossings
Facitlitiesf for crossing of cattle through underpasses shall be provided at locations required

Lateral clearance for an expressway is the distance between edge of the carriageway
and the face of nearest support which may be a solid abutment, pier or column.
Desirably, the full roadway width at the approaches shall be carried through the underpass.
However, the minimum lateral clearance shall be 10.5 m for vehicular underpasses and 4
m for pedestrian/cattle underpasses.
Where the expressway will be in underpass requiring continuation of safety barriers, the
safety barriers must be located at distance of 0.60 m from the face of the nearest support
and 0.25 m from the edge of paved shoulder.

under passes, the vertical clearance shall be minimum 3.0 m, which may be increased to
4.5 m in case of such animals as elephant/camel expected to cross.
Traffic composition shall be kept in view in planning and design of underpasses, over

Interchange Design
CHAPTER - 2
INTERCHANGE DESIGN
2.1
INTRODUCTION
Fundamentally, an interchange simply provides an opportunity for traffic to transfer from one
road to another. Design of an interchange is required to provide safe and efficient movement
of vehicles. This allows for the greatest capacity and level-of-service that can be achieved
by providing uninterrupted travel for expressway users. Naturally, the type of interchange
proposed must be adequately designed to accommodate the anticipated traffic in order for
the entire expressway section or segment to achieve the desired results.
2.1.1
Justification for interchanges
There shall be no at-grade intersection of any road with the project expressway.  The
intersection of the Project Expressway with another expressway or other highway (NH)
shall be through interchanges.
All traffic without exception, needing access to the project highway shall join the project highway
through an acceleration lane.  Similarly, all traffic exiting the project highway shall be through an
exit ramp from where it would distribute to the local road network for various destinations.
Each situation is required to be analysed in respect of the traffic, terrain, hazards etc. Therefore,
provision of an interchange shall be analysed with regard to the following major factors:
i)
Elimination of congestion: Traffic operation analysis at the intersection may
indicate the need for an interchange to provide for the traffic demands. Insufficient
capacity at an intersection of two high volume expressways or of one road and
the expressway results in delay and increased operating expenses.
ii)
Elimination of hazard: Some intersections have a high accident rate even
though lightly travelled. The provision of an interchange at such locations
can be justified to prevent/minimise potential for fatal accidents.
iii)
Topography: There are some sites where existing topography creates a
condition where the only rationale is to provide a grade separation. These
sites may be such that dictate provision of an interchange.



======================================================================
PAGE 220 of 528
======================================================================
II - 60
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
iv)
Traffic volumes: This is most tangible of all factors for justification of an
interchange. Although it is difficult for the designers to decide specific volumes
warranting the provision of an interchange, it is an important guide when combined
with the traffic distribution patterns and the likely effect of traffic behaviour.
2.2
LOCATION PLANNING
The locations of individual interchanges are determined primarily to reduce detour
considering regional network and nearness to places of importance. Location of
interchange is guided by
i)
At crossing or nearest points of other Expressways, National Highways,
State Highways and important arterial roads.
ii)
At crossing or nearest points of major roads to important ports, airports,
material transport facilities, commercial and industrial areas, and places of
tourist interest.
The exact location should consider the gradient of intersecting roads which shall desirably
be flat not exceeding 2 percent. Special measures shall be considered for mountainous
topography steeper than 3 percent, since combination of 6 percent super elevation and
gradient steeper than 3 percent would lead to difficult manoeuvre.
2.3
INTERCHANGE SPACING
2.3.1
General
Generally interchange spacing is based upon demand for access from the important cross
roads, adequate distance to provide for signing and weaving, and adequate distance to
permit sufficient lengths of speed change lanes for the respective adjacent interchanges
to operate safely and efficiently at the desirable level of service. As a general guide the
following may be provided for preliminary design consideration of interchanges spacing.
a)
Between cities - a spacing of 20 – 30 km would be desirable
b)
City outskirt areas - a spacing of 15 – 25 km would be desirable
c)
Urban areas – In areas of concentrated urban development where the
habitation and development is considerable : a spacing of   5 – 10 km
would be desirable
The desirable minimum spacing shall be 4 km and absolute minimum as 3 km from
deceleration, weaving and acceleration considerations. Special consideration for lane



======================================================================
PAGE 221 of 528
======================================================================
II - 61
Interchange Design
balance and provision of additional lanes should be studied for closely spaced interchanges.
For spacing less than 3 km, both the interchanges shall be considered as a combined one.
2.3.2
Route continuity
Route continuity is another consideration which refers to the provision of a directional
path along and throughout the length of a designated route. The designation pertains to a
route number or a name of a major expressway. Route continuity is an extension of the
principle of operational uniformity coupled with the application of proper lane balance and
the principle of maintaining basic number of lanes.
The principle of route continuity simplifies the driving task in that it reduces lane changes,
simplifies signing, delineates the through route, and reduces the driver’s search for
directional signing.
Desirably, the through driver, especially the unfamiliar driver, should be provided with a
continuous through route on which changing lanes is not necessary.
In the process of maintaining route continuity, particularly through cities and bypasses,
interchange configurations need not always favour the higher volume of traffic but rather
the through route. In this situation, higher volume of traffics can be designed on flat curves
with reasonably direct connections and auxiliary lanes, which is operationally equivalent
to through movement.
2.4
TYPES AND FORMS OF INTERCHANGES
2.4.1
Types of interchanges
There are two broad categories of Interchanges, based on traffic exchange:
i)
Service Interchanges: This refers to an interchange of the Expressway
with a road less in importance than Expressway.
For this category, it is considered that Expressway shall be toll roads, and
the other intersecting road shall be a “non-tolled” road or a road with open
system of tolling with the toll plaza on the other road minimum 2 km away.
This requires the consideration of tolling system which considers a barrier
system as well as toll booths on the interchange ramps. This requires
consideration for appropriate deceleration and acceleration lengths and
operating speed limitations in the interchange areas.



======================================================================
PAGE 222 of 528
======================================================================
II - 62
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
ii)
System Interchanges: This refers to an interchange between two
Expressways
For this category, since both the intersecting routes are toll roads under
closed system, the aspects of toll booths on ramps are not required. The
system need to cater for high speed operation. The toll aspect needs to be
considered on integrated basis between the two involved concessionaires.
The modalities need to be suitably addressed.
2.4.2
Forms of interchanges
In selection of basic forms, the following aspects need consideration:
i)
The nature of terrain and availability of land;
ii)
The geometrics of the intersecting roadways and the prioritized turning and
through traffic movement on the cross-road;
iii)
Coordinated traffic handling, to ensure safety during travelling as well;
iv)
Economic factors such as initial cost, operation and maintenance costs,
and vehicle operating costs;
v)
Environmental considerations including mitigation measures against adverse
impact both permanent and temporary during construction;
vi)
The effect/impact of noise level during and after the construction of interchange;
Each interchange site should be studied and alternate designs made to determine the most
fitting arrangement of structures and ramps. Fig. 2.01 presents typical forms of Interchanges.
For toll expressways in India, the form of interchange will be such that all traffic will pass
through a single point for collection of toll at one place.  Advantages of integrated toll plaza
are: (i) less numbers of toll lanes, (ii) higher level of security, (iii) efficient operation and
maintenance, and (iv) quick response to incident management.
2.4.2.1
Service interchanges
Generally, trumpet and T-interchange are the preferred configuration.  The advantages are
(a) suitable for three way junction with no weaving, (b) limited requirement of ROW area,
(c) single point toll booth ,and (d) provides a relatively high speed (compared to loops)
semi-directional turning movement.
Diamond and Cloverleaf Interchanges require a number of toll plazas on ingress/egress
ramps.  Whereas Trumpet or T-interchange require single toll plaza. Fig. 2.02 presents
typical Diamond and Trumpet interchanges.

System interchanges
As mentioned earlier, system interchanges to handle high volume of traffic.  The connecting
ramps can be directional, semi-directional and large radius loops as well. The aspect of
toll sharing between adjacent concessionaires shall be integrated. For system
interchanges also, the basic forms may comprise of three legs or four legs.
For Three Leg Interchanges, the T type configuration would require larger loops and semi
directional ramps of larger radius based on traffic volumes. This may also require catering
for frontage road consideration.
For Four Leg Interchanges, the forms may be Diamond, clover leafs directional and semi
directional interchanges and composite interchanges requiring combinations of straight,
curved or with loops and weaving. These configurations generally require multi level
structures.   Fig. 2.03 presents services and system interchanges.

2.4.2.3
Typical interchanges
Fig 2.01(A) shows a trumpet interchange at the junction of an expressway and a major
local road in a rural area. This pattern also explains the relatively sharp radius on the loop.
The design favours the heavier traffic movement that is provided by the semi-direct
connection, and loop handles the lighter volume.
The Y configuration interchange (shown in Fig 2.01(B)) may be provided when all three intersection
legs have a through character or the intersection angle with the third intersection leg is small.
Fig 2.01(C) shows a directional, T-interchange crossing between two expressways. The
turning roadways are liberally designed to permit high-speed operation. All movements
are directional, three structures are needed, and weaving is avoided. This plan is suitable
for the intersection of a through expressway with the terminal of another major expressway.
Some or all of the interchanging movements will need at least two-lane roadways. All
entrances and exits are designed as branch connections or major forks.
Fig 2.01(D) shows a semi directional T-interchange between two expressways in a rural area.
The directional design with large radii permits high-speed operation for all movements. The
frontage roads provide desirable one-way operations with connections from the interchange
roadways being as long as practical. The separation distance between major forks and the
ramp terminals that follow should be sufficient to provide for smooth traffic operations.
Fig. 2.01(E) presents a minor T-interchange with at grade intersection (rotary/signal).
A Diamond Interchange (shown in Fig 2.01(F and G)) is formed when a one-way diagonal
ramp is provided in each quadrant. The ramps are aligned with free-flow terminals on the
major expressway, and the left turns at grade are confined to the crossroad.
Fig. 2.01(H) is similar to Fig. 2.01(G) with staggered ramp provisions - suitable for land
constraint situtation.
A Simple Split diamond is one in which each pair of ramps connected to a separate
crossroad about a block apart. As shown in Fig 2.01(I), conflicts are minimized by handling
the same traffic at four rather than two crossroad intersections, reducing the left-turn
movements at each intersection from two to one. A disadvantage with this arrangement is
that traffic leaving the expressway cannot return to the expressway at the same interchange.
Fig. 2.01(J) is a partial/half diamond type - used at minor intersections.
Cloverleafs (shown in Fig 2.01(K and M)) are four-leg interchanges that employ loop ramps
to accommodate left-turning movements. Interchanges with loops in all four quadrants are
referred to as “full cloverleafs” and all others are referred to as “partial cloverleafs.” A full
cloverleaf may not be warranted at major-minor crossings where, with the provision of only
two loops, freedom of movement for traffic on the major road can be maintained by confining

Interchange Design
the direct at-grade left turns to the minor road. The principal disadvantages of the cloverleaf
are the additional travel distance for left-turning traffic, the weaving manoeuvre generated,
the very short weaving on the main line, the double exit on the main line, and problems
associated with signing for the second exit. Because cloverleafs are considerably more
expensive than diamond interchanges, they are less common in urban areas and are better
adapted to suburban or rural areas where space is available. This type forms symmetrical
and beautiful geometry and requires only one grade separation structure.
Collector-distributor roads are to be provided along the expressway in expectation of
heavy weaving volumes. Because of the high unit cost of right-of-way, this design was
more economical with the collector-distributor roads and loop ramps with smaller radii. A
design with ramps of larger radii would have been used if the collector-distributor roads
had not been provided. The grades are relatively flat, with three percent being maximum.
(Fig 2.01(L)).
Elevated Roundabout (as shown in Fig 2.01(N)) provides a relatively simple solution with
four or more approaches where speed and volumes are not high. Generally on a split level
structure, the main expressway is taken at ground level and the roundabout with weaving
movements is taken at high upper level. It requires large land area. The weaving sections
limit the speed and capacity. The directional signing is difficult unless the diameter of the
circle is large enough to provide adequate length in the weaving sections. The weaving
type does not contain at-grade intersections, where all ramps are not independently
provided and two or more carriageway (through traffic lane or ramps) are partially
overlapped and weaved.
Fully Directional Interchanges (as shown in Fig 2.01(O)) are generally preferred where
two high-volume expressways intersect. Since traffic movements between the two
expressways are free-flow with this interchange configuration, there are no at-grade
intersections, only direct ramp connections from one expressway to the other.
2.5
CAPACITY CONSIDERATIONS
The design of interchanges must be coordinated with the design of the expressway. The
design process consists of the following:
•
preliminary design to set the locations of the ramps
•
calculation of ramp and intersection capacity
•
check of the design geometrics to ensure adequate sight distances
•
preliminary design inspection to make sure all concepts are feasible

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Capacity analysis of an interchange is a complex phenomenon and depends on the
geometric configuration of the ramp i.e. direct, semi direct or loop and the gradient available
for operation.
A thumb rule and for a preliminary design, as considered by various authorities, consider
loop ramps for 800 – 1200 vehicles per hour (vph) semi direct ramps for 1200-1500 vph
and direct ramps for more than 1500 vph.
The reduction/avoidance of the effects of ingress and egress traffic on the through lanes
at the interchange is a prime requirement. These facilities require capacity analysis for
vehicle manoeuvres, which include merging, diverging, weaving and angular crossings.
The capacity analysis for these complex movements are dependent on the horizontal and
vertical alignment, composition of classified traffic, weaving and turning volume. “Highway
Capacity Manual - 2000 (HCM-2000) of Transportation Research Board, National
Research Council, Washington DC is most widely accepted document. Till the formulation
of Indian Highway Capacity Manual, HCM-2000 of USA may be used for such analysis
with considerations for Indian situation.  More details on capacity analysis have been
given in “Volume-I : Planning”.
2.6
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
2.6.1
Ramp types
Ramps are provided at interchanges for desired turning movements. Based on movement
requirements, the connecting ramps may be classified as Direct, Semi-direct and Loop ramps.
Loop ramp is for right turns accomplished by a left exit and turn to the left through about
2700. A loop ramp may have single turning movement (left or right or double turning
movements (left and right) at either or both ends.
Semi-directional ramp for right turns accomplished through a partial duration from the
intended path. With semi-directional connection, the driver makes a left turn first, heading
away from the intended direction, gradually changing, and then completing the movement
by following directly abound and entering the other road.

2.6.2
Design speed
Desirably, ramp design speed should approximate the low-volume running speed on the
intersecting expressways. As mentioned in AASHTO – 2004, this design speed is not
always practical and lower design speeds may be selected. Policy for Geometric Design
of Rural Road by AUSTROAD (earlier NAASRA) recommends the Design Speed for
interchange elements as given in Table 2.01.  For expressways in India, these speeds
can be adopted.
Table: 2.01 Recommended Design Speeds for Interchange Ramps
Ramp design speeds above 50 kmph for loops require longer length and large areas,
which are expensive and require additional travel distance. For these reasons, ramp speed
may have to be limited for Service Interchanges to keep the requirement of interchange
area to a reasonable limit.  Speed shall be reduced from around 120 kmph to stopping
requirement at Toll Plaza, if provided on ramp.
For System Interchanges direct, semi direct or loops (with larger radius) may be considered.
2.6.3
Width and cross-section
The ramp cross-section showing carriageway width and shoulder (both paved and earthen)
is given in Fig. 2.05 for single lane and two way two lane ramps on tangent alignment.
The width of paved and earthen shoulders considered here are for interchange ramp
design only.  Applicable extra wide carriageway shall be provided, as needed from ramp
radius consideration.

The extra width of carriageway to be provided at horizontal curves on single and
two-lane roads is given in Table 2.02. In bracket (Bold) values indicates the rounded
values. For multi-lane roads, the pavement widening may be calculated by adding
half the widening for two-lane roads to each lane.  As an illustration on a curve of
30 m radius for a six lane expressway, the extra width shall be 3.0 m for each
carriageway

NOTE: * Single lane- with provision for passing a stalled vehicle.
On simple (unspiraled) curves, widening should be applied on the inside edge of the
travelled way only. On curves designed with spirals, widening may be applied on the inside
edge or divided equally on either side of the centreline.
Curve widening should transition gradually over a length sufficient to make the whole of
the travelled way fully usable.
Preferably, widening should transition over the superelevation runoff length, but shorter
lengths are sometimes used.

GEOMETRIC DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
For interchange ramps, due to low volume (compared to main expressway lane),
different parameter values on sight distance (both stopping and decision making
consideration), maximum super elevation, side friction coefficients and longitudinal
gradients shall be adopted.

2.7.2
Super elevation and side friction factor
Most of the ramps have curvilinear alignment which may comprise tangent,
transition, compound and simple curved. Considering the likely high percentage
of trucks in traffic mix and the alignment curvature it is recommended to limit the
super elevation and side friction values. Table 2.03B presents the minimum radius
values for various combinations of speed, super elevation and side friction.
Computed from e + f = V2/127R
The length of vertical curves shall be checked against decision sight distance (Refer to
Chapter-1: Geometric Design Section).
2.7.1
Sight distance
Stopping and decision making sight distances depend on the manoeuvring time
required. Stopping involves brake reaction time, braking distance depending on
driver’s deceleration rate while decision sight distance is a combination of speed/
path/direction change and driver’s unexpected incidents. The Table 2.03A provides
the recommended values.

LANE BALANCE
To ensure efficient operation and to realise the capacity potential where merging, diverging
and weaving take place, an additional lane may be required in addition to capacity analysis.
The following basic principles should be considered.
2.8.1
Exit from expressway
Beyond Exit i.e. point of divergence from expressway, the number of through traffic lanes
on expressway may be
a)
Same number, or

2.9
WEAVING SECTIONS
The high traffic demand near urban / outskirt areas may require construction of a number
of interchanges.  This may necessitate the establishment of a minimum spacing distance
considering, deceleration, weaving and acceleration. The deceleration and acceleration
lengths may be considered as given in this section. Weaving length may be considered
on the following principles:
a)
Weaving sections not on the principal carriageway should have a minimum
length of 0.2 times Q (in metres). Q being the total weaving traffic in PCU/hour.
The number of lanes necessary (i.e. provision of auxiliary lane) on this hypothesis
is calculated by multiplying the smaller weaving flow by a factor of 3.
b)
If, in exceptional situations, a weaving section cannot be avoided on the
expressway, the length Q metres shall be a minimum of 600 m (based on
Japanese standard).
c)
The interchange should be so designed that, within its limit, the total weaving
traffic is less than 2,000 PCU/hour.
2.10
EXIT AND ENTRANCE TERMINALS
Interchange ramps are made of three distinct components - two terminal ends and
a connecting roadway. The connecting roadway is often referred to as the ramp
proper, or simply the ramp. Based on operational aspects, taper and parallel or a
combination design of ramp terminals are common practice in almost all countries.
(Fig. 2.04).
The taper design works on the principle of direct egress and ingress from/to Expressway
at flat angle. The taper type design reduces the amount of driver steering control and,
especially on exit ramps, fits well the direct path preferred by most drivers. However,
taper design used on entrance ramps requires the drivers to time share between the
tasks of accelerating, searching for an acceptable gap, and steering along the lane.
In India parallel type is preferable, especially for entrances. The parallel type designs
require a reverse-curve manoeuvre and provide the driver with full view from side or rear
view mirror to adjust with the following traffic.

2.11
ACCELERATION/DECELERATION LANES
Each entry and exit ramp shall have acceleration/deceleration lane for the project expressway.
The length of the acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be decided on the basis of speed
differentials of the project highway traffic and the speed permitted on the ramps.
Drivers exiting an interchange are required to reduce speed to meet with toll payment
where such a scheme exists.  Drivers entering an expressway from a ramp accelerate
until the adjacent through lane speed is reached.
Provision should be made for acceleration and deceleration to be accomplished on
additional lanes to minimize interference with through traffic and to reduce accident
potential.  Such an auxiliary lane is called speed change lane.
For safety, expressway exits should be located on tangent sections, wherever possible to
provide maximum sight distance and optimum traffic manoeuvrability operation .The
following recommendations should be considered from safety aspect.
Typical requirements of Acceleration length and Deceleration length and speed change
length adjustment factors are presented in Tables 2.04, 2.05 & 2.06 A, B and C respectively.

TRAFFIC DISPERSAL SCHEMES
2.12.1
Introduction
On Access Controlled Expressways, the services of collection and distribution of traffic is
provided through specially designed interchanges at selected locations along the route
and at the terminal ends. The high volume of ingress and egress traffic at the interchanges
as well as at the terminals would require considerations of local road network, its present
capacity, physical condition of road, possibilities of improvements etc. This total complex
system may be addressed under Traffic Dispersal Schemes. In real terms, the benefit of
high level investments on expressway can be appreciated only through an effective and
efficient traffic dispersal scheme. After enjoying a high level of service, the users should
not be pressed into nerve-raking delays due to over congested roads and signals at the
dispersal point.
2.12.2
General considerations
Generally provision of an access or interchange shall be made on economic
considerations. An expressway without intermediate access would be efficient for through

traffic, but it could not be considered efficient in an overall sense. Sometimes, physical
barriers or adverse topographical conditions dictate location of an access.
Normally at traffic collection/dispersal locations, connections are made to the surface
street system either directly to or in close proximity to a major surface artery which is of
carrying the traffic to the distributor road network system and also of feeding the expressway
with ingress traffic.
The regional town planning/highway department shall be involved in improvement of the
road network system to provide ingress traffic to expressway as well as to disperse the
egress traffic from the expressway.
This is a complex planning process involving various States and concerned authorities. A

Embankment and Cutting
CHAPTER – 3
EMBANKMENT AND CUTTING
3.1
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
The expressway alignment is intended to provide for high level of safety and efficiency in
movement with large volumes of traffic at high speeds. These facilities are designed to
be access controlled, requiring provision of grade separated structures to allow/maintain
cross road traffic services.
All these involve the expressway to be built in embankment, or cutting or on long elevated
structures.
Desirably, a minimum height of 3.5 m shall be considered to accommodate animals,
pedestrians, agricultural vehicles etc requiring a minimum vertical clearance of 2.5 m.
The Finished Road Levels (FRL) shall be finalised with this minimum value as datum.
The height of embankment shall be based on the final road levels.  The following principles
shall be followed for fixing the road level:
i)
The top of the sub-grade is at least 1.0 m above the high flood level/high
water Table/pond level.   However, in exceptional circumstances where it is
found difficult to fulfil this criterion, a minimum difference of 0.6 m between
the top of sub-grade and HFL/high water Table/pond level shall be ensured.
ii)
To fulfil the minimum free board requirement and provide smooth vertical
profile for portions forming approaches to structures.
Structural Features and Design of Embankment
Embankment shall be designed to ensure that stability of the roadway and shall incorporate
only those materials, which are suitable for embankment construction.
Embankment instability may result from a variety of causes, and the modes of failure can
be numerous.  Failure can occur in almost every conceivable manner, slowly or suddenly,
and with or without any apparent provocation. Failures within the body of the embankment
may arise due to adoption of incorrect design. When a high embankment is made up of
sandy soil, one of the possible measures against erosion is to have a blanket cover of
cohesive soil over the sandy core.



======================================================================

======================================================================
II - 86
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Embankment Slope
Flat, rounded side-slopes, fitting with the topography and consistent with available
right-of-way, shall be provided on rural Expressways.  Embankment slopes shall not
be steeper than 1V:2H.  Slopes of 1V:4H or flatter are desirable for embankments of
moderate height.  For high embankments, steeper slopes protected by safety barriers
may be needed.
For embankment heights more than 6.0 m, slope stability of embankment will dictate the
side slopes. High embankment (height 6 m or above) in all soils shall be designed from
stability considerations.  For design of high embankments IRC:75 and MORTH –
Guidelines for Deign of High Embankment may  be referred.  This has been further
elaborated later on.
Most slips occur in cohesive materials because of weakening of soil with increase in
moisture content. Reduction in moisture in such cases can result in substantial
improvement in stress-resisting properties of the soil. Efficient surface, sub-surface and
interceptor drains fulfil the function of supporting the slope against failure by preventing
the entry of surface water which would have caused softening of the soil.
The side slopes shall be protected against erosion by providing turfing/vegetative cover,
stone/CC block pitching, geo-synthetics, gabion walls or any other measures depending
on the height of the embankment, type of soil involved and susceptibility of soil to erosion
as per IRC:56.  Pitching works on slopes shall be as per MORTH Specifications.
Retaining Structures
The embankment shall be retained by the retaining structures conforming to site conditions.
The type of earth retaining structures shall be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with
adjoining structures.   This has been further elaborated later on.

SALIENT STRUCTURAL FEATURES ON EMBANKMENT DESIGN
The embankment height governs the types of material to be used. The nature of foundation
materials has a significant influence on the design of embankment.
For design of embankment involving internal and global stability, various methods are
available in documents published by Indian Roads Congress (IRC) and the Bureau of
Indian Standards (BIS).
A brief list (not necessarily exhaustive) is presented below.

======================================================================
PAGE 248 of 528
======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The basic requirement involves
a)
Stability Analysis, and
b)
Settlement Analysis
3.3.1
Stability analysis
The calculation of slope stability is well described in the guidelines for the design of high
embankments (IRC:75-1979). Different cases of calculation using total stresses and
effective stresses are presented. However, manual computations are laborious and also
not desirable to carryout for a bigger project, because it is important to test quickly a wide
range of parameters. There are softwares available for such calculations capable of
simulating the flow of water through soil and embankment and so constitute a help to
improve stability by designing any appropriate measure for drainage.
Any software available for slope stability may be used.
3.3.2
Settlement analysis
Settlements are of two types: embankment settlement and ground settlement.
The embankment settlement is more or less controlled during the construction and should
be reduced by strict application of specifications about compaction rate. According to the
specifications of MORTH, expansive clay may be used in embankment and the minimum
required relative compaction is only 90 percent. These materials should therefore be
avoided as much as possible because of risk of delayed settlement especially because
of the cycle of wet/dry conditions.
3.3.3
Fill slopes
i)
From safety consideration slopes steeper than 1V:3H are not generally used.
With road side barrier, slopes steeper than 1V:3H may be permitted with
the following considerations:
•
For clayey sand to sandy clay fill materials a slope of 1V:3-4H may be
used for height more than 5.0 m and 1V:2-3H for heights below 5.0 m.
•
For sandy and gravely fill materials, a slope of  1V:2H may be used.
ii)
In case of scarcity of fill materials or where land availability is a problem, use
of retaining structures including reinforced earth construction may be made.

The Reinforced Earth Structure shall be designed in conformity with MORTH – Specifications
for Road and Bridge Works : Fourth Revision, Section 703 and in accordance with
i)
BS:8006-1995 “Strengthen/Reinforced Soils and Other fills”
ii)

Concrete Masonry Association (NCMA) Washington, DC, meeting the
ultimate and serviceability limit state requirements.
The reinforcing elements may be hot dip galvanised steel strips, or Geosynthetic Material
(i.e. geogrid reinforcement or geotextiles reinforcement) or any other proprietary material
conforming to MORTH Specifications.
3.3.4
Cut slopes
Generally the slope is decided by the stability and erosion prevention consideration and
the soil / rock formation through which the road passes.
i)
On impervious Soils
A slope of 1V:2H for heights up to 5.0 m and 1V:2.5H for heights above
5.0 m may be used.
ii)
In Rocky Areas
The recommended values are for normal slope conditions where minimising
or preventing rock falls are major concern and massive land sliding is not a
problem. The generally  adopted values are given in Table 3.01.

3.3.5
Ground improvement
3.3.5.1
Requirements and investigations
Where the embankment is to be supported on a weak stratum, it may be necessary to
adopt remedial/ground improvement measures to provide the safe bearing capacity. This
would require detailed geotechnical investigations to evaluate the soil profile, ground water
levels and soil properties.
The appropriate measures for ground improvement will depend on these investigations.
Further analysis is required if there is evidence of any of the following
a)
Difficult soils, such as expansive or collapsing soil and sensitive or
dispersive clay
b)
Potential for liquefaction
c)
Potential for slope instability
d)
Potential for excess seepage, high uplift pressures or erosion and piping
3.3.5.2
Methods of ground improvement
Many methods for ground modification and improvement are available, including
dewatering, compaction, preloading with and without vertical drains, admixture stabilization,
grouting of several types, deep mixing, deep densification, and soil reinforcement.
Methods (not exhaustive) generally adopted for ground treatment are as follows:
a)
Soil Replacement
Soil replacement involves excavating the soil that needs to be improved and replacing it.
The excavated soil can sometimes be recompacted to a satisfactory state or it may be
treated with admixtures and then be replaced in a controlled manner. It can also be replaced
with a different soil with more suitable properties for the proposed application
b)
Roller Compacted Concrete
Roller compacted concrete (RCC) is a material that has useful applications for ground
improvement. Roller compacted concrete is essentially no-slump concrete composed of
a blend of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, cement and water. It is placed and spread



======================================================================

======================================================================

Embankment and Cutting
using conventional earth moving equipment, compacted with vibratory rollers and allowed
to cure. During curing, the Roller compacted concrete hydrates and hardens into weak
concrete.
c)
Vibrocompaction and Vibrorod
Vibrocompaction methods use vibrating probes (typically having a diameter of about 0.4 m)
to densify the soil. The probe is usually jetted into the ground to the desired depth of improvement
and vibrated during withdrawal, causing densification. The soil densifies as the probe is
repeatedly inserted and withdrawn in about 1 m increments. The cavity that forms at the surface
is backfilled with sand or gravel to form a column of densified soil. Vibrocompaction methods
are most effective for sands and gravels with fines less than about 20 percent.
d)
Stone Columns (Vibro-replacement)
Stone columns are installed using a process similar to Vibrocompaction, except that a gravel
backfill is used, and they are usually installed in slightly cohesive soils or silty sands rather than
clean sands. In the dry process, a cylindrical cavity is formed by the vibrator, that is filled from the
bottom up with gravel or crushed rock. Compaction is by vibration and displacement during
repeated 0.5 m withdrawals and insertions of the vibrator. Stone columns are usually about 1 m
in diameter, depending on the soil conditions, equipment and construction procedures. They are
usually installed in square or triangular grid patterns, but may also be used in clusters and rows to
support footings and walls. Center-to-center column spacings of 1.5 to 3.5 m are typical.
e)
Gravel Drains
Gravel drains are a type of stone column proposed for use in liquefiable soils to mitigate
liquefaction risk by dissipation of excess pore water pressures generated during
earthquakes. These are for use in two ways: (1) as the sole treatment method for liquefiable
zones and (2) as a perimeter treatment around improved zones to intercept pore pressure
plumes from adjacent untreated ground. Gravel drains are constructed in the same manner
as stone columns, but are installed in cohesionless deposits. As the gravel is densified
during vibro-replacement, there is mixing of the sand with the gravel in the drain. The
degree of mixing has a strong influence on the final permeability of the gravel drain.
f)
Compaction Grouting
Compaction grouting consists of injecting a very-low slump mortar into loose soils and



======================================================================
PAGE 252 of 528
======================================================================
II - 92
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
cavities. The grout forms a bulb which expands against the surrounding soil, causing
densification and displacement to occur. The grout acts as a radial hydraulic jack to
compress the surrounding soil. The grout is usually a mix of sandy soil with enough fines
to bind the mix together, cement, and water. A typical compaction grout mix consists of
about 3 parts sand to 1 part cement, although cement is not always used. The grout forms
a bulb up to about 1 m in diameter that is relatively strong and incompressible after it
hardens. The process causes an overall decrease in the void ratio of the formation.
Compaction grouting is most effective for loose granular soils, collapsible soils, and loose,
grained soils.
g)
Prefabricated Vertical (PV) Drains, With or Without Surcharge Fills
Prefabricated vertical (PV) drains, also known as wick drains, are typically installed in
soft, cohesive soil deposits to increase the rate of consolidation settlement and
corresponding strength gain. The rate of consolidation settlement is proportional to the
square of the length of the drainage path to the drain. Installing vertical drains shortens the
drainage path which causes an increase in the rate of settlement. Geocomposites are
widely used as drains because they are relatively inexpensive, economical to install and
have a high flow capacity. Geocomposite drains consist of a plastic waffle core which
conveys the water and a geotextile filter to protect the core from clogging. In selecting a
drain, it is important to choose one with enough capacity. Drains are typically spaced in a
triangular or rectangular configuration. A sand blanket is usually placed on the surface of
the consolidating layer to facilitate drainage. Surcharge preloading can be used in
conjunction with vertical drains to increase the magnitude of settlement prior to construction.
3.3.6
Use of fly ash for embankment construction
i)
Fly ash shall be used for construction of embankment in accordance with
guidelines of MORTH. The embankment shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with IRC:SP-58. The thickness of soil cover shall be not less
than 1 m for embankments upto 3 m height. For high embankments, the
thickness of soil cover shall be increased as per design.
ii)
The side slopes of the embankment shall be protected against erosion.
iii)
The stability analysis of the embankment shall be carried out as per IRC:75.

CHAPTER – 4
PAVEMENT DESIGN
4.1
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Expressways are intended to serve high volume traffic and cater for highest safety and
comfort in driving. These basic requirements demand minimum maintenance limiting traffic
disruption to lowest. This would require
a)
Adequately designed pavement from structural strength considerations, and
b)
Safety and comfort of users
While the structural aspects are generally well covered in IRC design standards coupled
with MORTH policy, the safety and comfort aspects are related more to surface
characteristics. This chapter deals with these aspects i.e. Traffic Safety and Driving Comfort.
Imported elements are:
i)
Enhanced safety requirements, compatible with high traffic speeds and
volumes;
ii)
Adequate driving comfort for long distance high speed travel;
iii)
Provision of the needed safety and comfort levels on a sustained basis
without any dislocation, disturbance or inconvenience to the traffic.
Traffic Safety depends on a number of factors including pavement surface characteristics,
the vehicles and the drivers.  Safe vehicle pavement interaction at high speeds, apart
from adequacy of geometric design for the traffic speeds and volumes, needs special
attention to the aspect of skid resistance and hydro-planing. These properties of the
pavement are related to its surface texture and surface drainage characteristics.
Driving Comfort considerations call for increasingly more even surface with increase in
speed. More stringent norms need to be adopted as compared to other highways. The
choice of construction and quality control techniques, compatible with the assurance of
the needed level of surface evenness, becomes particularly significant in this context.



======================================================================
PAGE 256 of 528
======================================================================
II - 96
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The three main characteristics expected of an expressway pavement surface from the-
users’ point of view are:
i)
Good riding quality (low roughness value);
ii)
Skid-resistance i.e. good pavement - tyre friction including under wet weather
situation;
iii)
Absence or limitation of rutting on wheel tracks.
The new expressway pavement may be designed as flexible pavement in accordance
with IRC:37 or rigid pavement in accordance with IRC:58.
4.2
RIDING QUALITY
Roughness of road is a major determinant of safety, cost of vehicle operation, comfort
and speed of travel. Its accurate measurements are of vital importance to a highway
engineer. The important uses of roughness measurements are:
i)
To assess maintenance needs;
ii)
To assess quality of construction.
The riding quality of a pavement is determined to a large extent by its functional and
structural adequacy, the cumulative axle load repetitions, specification adopted for the
surface initially, and the maintenance inputs. Hence pavement performance can be
assessed through monitoring roughness.
Roughness of a road surface is expressed in mm/km or m/km. The former is known as BI
(Bump Integrator) value and the latter one is known as IRI (International Roughness Index)
value. In India it is common to use BI value.
4.2.1
Measurement of riding quality
Type C i.e. APL Inertial profilometres is recommended for measurement of roughness or
a suitable method may be adopted from World Bank Technical Paper No. 46 – Guidelines
for Conducting and Calibrating Road Roughness Measurement.
For assessment of surface roughness, two main approaches are available as mentioned below:
a)
Response-type equipment recording relative movement between a single-
wheel trailer and its standardized chassis, when towed at or corrected to a
standard speed.   The TRL Fifth wheel Bump Integrator is one such equipment.
Calibrated vehicle mounted bump integrator is convenient for long stretch survey.

b)
Profile characterization and characterizing equipment. This can range
from rod and level measurements at close intervals, to high-speed laser-
based profilometers. The first significant automated equipment to be
developed was the CHLOE Profilometer developed for the AASHTO Road
Test for monitoring of slope variance. Slope variance was subsequently
correlated with unevenness index as assessed by the Bump Integrator, for
more expeditious assessment.
c)
APL Inertial Profilometre – The LCPC Longitudinal Profile Analyzer (APL)
is designed for continuous high speed evaluation of 100 to 300 km of the
expressway per day. The APL consists of a special towed trailer that has
one bicycle type wheel, a chassis with ballast, and a special low frequency
inertial pendulum that serves as a pseudo-horizontal reference. The trailer
is designed to be sensitive to only the profile of the traveled wheel track
over the frequency band of 0.5 to 20 Hz and towed at any constant speed
between 50 and 100 kmph.
Proper calibration of the riding quality monitoring equipment is a precondition for any
roughness measurement.
An overview of the riding quality monitoring equipment is given in Fig. 4.01.

SKID RESISTANCE
For improved traffic safety, attention is required to be paid to skid resistance of the
pavement surface.
The potential for an accident from skidding depends mainly on:
i)
Speed of the vehicles;
ii)
Cornering path i.e. minimum/near minimum curvature;
iii)
Magnitude of acceleration or deceleration;
iv)
Condition of vehicle tyres;
v)
Pavement Surface characteristics
Speed is the most significant parameter on wet pavements not only because the frictional
demand increase in proportion with the square of the speed but also because the skid

resistance at the tyre-pavement interface decreases with increasing speed. When the
depth of water on a pavement is excessive, skidding and/or hydro-planing effect can
occur even when the wet friction required by a particular manoeuvre does not exceed the
pavement skid number. In order to reduce the potential for hydro-planing at sites where
climatic or geometric conditions are likely to produce excessive water depths on the
pavement, it is necessary to understand the role of pavement surface properties in skid
resistance.
The pavement surface properties that influence skid resistance can be divided into two
categories, micro texture and macro texture.
Pavement micro texture consists of the microscopic texture on the surface of the individual
pieces of aggregate, and to a lesser extent on the surface of the pavement binder (asphalt
or portland cement).  Micro-texture is what makes a piece of aggregate feel smooth or
rough to the touch.
Pavement macro-texture consists of the large scale roughness or harshness associated
with voids on the pavement surface between pieces of aggregate.
In simpler terms, micro-texture is determined by the aggregate sizes and the manner
in which the individual pieces of aggregate are assembled to form a pavement
surface. Micro-texture has wavelengths from 0.5 mm to 50 mm and vertical amplitudes
ranging from 0.1 mm to 20 mm. Micro-texture plays a major role in wet weather
friction characteristics of pavement surfaces, especially at high vehicle speeds.
Therefore, pavements that are constructed to accommodate vehicles traveling at
speeds of 80 kmph or greater require good macro-texture to help prevent
hydroplaning. In addition to providing wet weather friction, macro-texture is the
pavement surface characteristic with the strongest impact (reduction) on tyre-
pavement noise and splash and spray.
It is important to understand that hydroplaning is different from skidding on wet pavement.
When hydroplaning occurs, the entire tyre footprint is separated (i.e. complete loss of
contact) from the pavement by a thin layer of water and the pavement surface texture no
longer plays a role in the friction process. When a rolling tyre encounters a film of water on
the roadway, the water is channeled through the tyre tread pattern and through the surface
texture of the pavement. Hydroplaning occurs when the drainage capacity of the tyre tread
pattern and pavement surface is exceeded and the water begins to build up in front of the
tyre, creating a wedge of water that lifts the tyre off the pavement surface.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Research has not clearly defined the depth of water at which hydro-planing occurs
because this phenomenon depends on a range of vehicle speeds, tyre tread patterns,
tyre pressure, and pavement surface textures. However, there is considerable
agreement on the water depth required to produce wheel “spin down” with sufficient
loss of tyre friction to present a major driving hazard. This approximate depth is in the
range of 1.5 to 5.0 mm.
It is quite a difficult task to prevent water from exceeding this depth specially on wide
pavements during high intensity rainfalls.  Speed management in such situations would
be a preferable solution.
4.3.1
Measurement of pavement skid resistance
A number of methods are available for measurement of skid resistance of the pavement
surface.   An overview is given in Fig. 4.02.
The skid resistance is determined using portable skid resistance tester after 6 (Six) hours
of polishing designed to produce a state similar to that which the aggregate would be
subjected to under actual traffic when equilibrium conditions are reached. This is termed
as Polished Stone Value (PSV). The aggregate durability is measured by Aggregate
Abrasion Value (AAV).
4.3.2
Practice in various countries
Various standards have been set for Polished Stone Value (PSV) requirements of stone
aggregates and minimum requirement of skid resistance by different organisations.
USA specifies the PSV depending on the traffic volume as given in Table 4.01:

Belgium has recommended minimum PSV as 50 for aggregate larger than 8 mm in
wearing course.
France suggests that aggregate with PSV between 45 and 55 is considered ‘good’ and
higher than 55 “very good”. Use of PSV 55 is recommended when alignment and traffic
conditions are not favourable.
Spain recommends that for bituminous pavement, the minimum PSV is from 40 to 45
depending on traffic volume and it can be from 50 to 55 in special cases.
Skid resistance guidelines adopted in some countries in Europe and Japan are presented
in Table 4.04.
In the UK, selecting the minimum PSV and maximum of the road aggregate AAV are
done iteratively. The design engineer selects a road stone with the required PSV in order
to maintain the desired skid resistance under the given traffic condition using value given
in Table 4.02 and Table 4.03.

Anti skid measures
Source: “Surface Characteristics” – TCR XVIII World Road Congress.
A very innovative and promising introduction is permeable wearing course over an
impervious surfacing. The permeable wearing course substantially reduces spray and
hydro-planing during heavy rains. However, this technique has still to overcome problems
of durability and is in restricted use for critical expressway sections though research
development continues in several countries to widen the scope of application.
For concrete pavements, choice of aggregate and construction techniques are utilized to
improve the skid resistance for a new surface. Belgium, with its good background of concrete
pavement construction, uses the following techniques for heavily trafficked highways:
i)
Chemical aggregate exposure using a setting retarder (where the aggregate
is non-polishing);
ii)
Chipping of fresh concrete (where the aggregate used in the main pavement
course is of polishing type);

iii)
Deep transverse grooving (less used since 1980 because of the resultant
high level of rolling noise).
In Japan, “steel line grooving technique” (following FHWA specification) has been used with
groove spacing 30 mm and target groove depth 3 mm. Additionally the concrete mix is so
designed that the mortar on the surface wears faster than the aggregate, thus exposing
aggregates and enhancing macro-texture. This essentially involves keeping down the cement
content of the mix which, however, can be in conflict with strength development objective. For
Sanyo Expressway project in Japan, the cement content of concrete mix was kept at 280 kg/
m3 and the design was based on the strength development not at 28 days but at 91 days.
Skid resistances of expressways are to be checked after construction and periodically
during service. Different highway research organizations have produced appropriate
equipments. The equipment developed by TRL, known as SCRIM (Sideway-force
Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine) is very well-known and has been in use in
several countries. The skidding resistance norms, based on SCRIM measurements and
as prescribed for UK motorways, are given in Table 4.05.

RUT DEPTH
The effect of chanelised heavy vehicles movement is to form corrugations or more
frequently, to create longitudinal ruts (deformations) along the wheel tracks.  The formation
of ruts leads to accumulation of water increasing the danger of skidding and hydro-planing.
Moreover, ruts make driving dangerous, specially when vehicles change lanes.
In some developed countries, limitation of the absolute or relative depth of ruts in the
transverse profiles is the design criterion, or it is used as a standard of judgment to decide
whether a road needs repair.
Generally, repair is recommended based on formation of rut (depth) measured using
1.2 m long straight edge. The practice in various countries is given below.

MORTH Report of the Committee on Norms for Maintenance of roads in India, 2001,
recommends a maximum 20 mm rut depth upto 1 percent on wheel path is recommended
as good.
It has been reported that ruts present a serious risk of rainwater accumulation and enhance
hydro-planing even when the depth is less than 10 mm. In general, it is also felt that the
ruts of 5 - 6 mm depth affect high speed traffic.  For rut depths more than 10 mm, the
effects are fairly troublesome for fast traffic.
Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) PWD Malaysia developed the following criteria Table 4.06
to assess current functional condition of expressways in terms of rutting, texture depth
and roughness.

DESIGN OF STRUCTURES
5.1
INTRODUCTION
An expressway alignment would meet various obstacles in the form of cross roads,
railways, rivers/waterways, canals, topographical features such as dips, gorges, valleys,
lakes and water bodies and other physical barriers. These obstacles are generally grouped

OVERPASS VERSUS UNDERPASS: Considerations
5.2.1
General design considerations
The green field expressway alignments are being planned generally as elevated
carriageways around 3.5 m above the adjoining ground levels. This considerations of



======================================================================
PAGE 274 of 528
======================================================================
II - 114
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
elevated platform is based on the premises of likely number of puncture to be provided for
which the vertical profile can not be configured.
For Group-1 through 4, the expressway needs to be carried on structures desirably
fulfilling the functional requirements of expressway users.
Group-5, Railway Crossings: Generally the railways are carried at higher elevation
compared to adjacent land. At such crossings i.e. where both expressways and railways
are at higher level, the high level structures may warrant considerations. Underpass for
the expressway (being a new facility) may be considered. The construction shall not stop
the railway services and the expressway shall be provided with safety facilities. Alternatively,
the expressway alignment may be shifted to a location where the railway levels are near
ground. This would require several alignment planning exercises.
Group-6: Interchanges are formed by the entry and exit ramps between the expressway
and cross road. At such locations, the expressway alignment dominates and the interchange
ramp geometrics works as connectors/facility providers. In cases, where the topography
of cross roads is considerably at higher level compared to expressway, then underpass
facility for the expressway may need to be examined.
With the above considerations, the planning exercise for underpass vis-à-vis overpass
shall be carried out. Based on literature survey, the followings are presented as guidelines
for the designer.
At any site, the issues governing whether a road should be carried over or under usually fall
into one of three groups: (1) the influence of topography predominates and, therefore, the
design should be closely fitted to it; (2) the topography does not favour any one arrangement;
and (3) the alignment and gradeline controls of one highway predominate and, therefore,
the design should accommodate that highway’s alignment instead of the site topography.
As a rule, a design that best fits the existing topography is the most pleasing and economical
to construct and maintain, and this factor becomes the first consideration in design. Where
topography does not govern, as is common in the case of flat topography, it may be appropriate
to study secondary factors, and the following general guidelines should be examined:
•
For the most part, designers are governed by the need for economy, which
is obtained by designs that fit existing topography, not only along the
intersecting highways but also for the whole of the area to be used for ramps



======================================================================
PAGE 275 of 528
======================================================================
II - 115
Design of Structures
and slopes. Thus, it is appropriate to consider alternatives in the interchange
area as a whole to decide whether the major road should go over or under
the crossroad.
•
An undercrossing highway has a general advantage in that an approaching
interchange may be easily seen by drivers. As a driver approaches, the
structure appears ahead, making the presence of the upper-level crossroad
obvious, and providing advance warning of the likely presence of interchange
ramps.
•
Through traffic is given aesthetic preference by a layout in which the more
important road is the overpass. A wide overlook can be provided from the
structure and its approaches, giving drivers a minimum feeling of restriction.
•
Where turning traffic is significant, the ramp profiles are best fitted when the
major road is at the lower level.
•
In rolling topography or in rugged terrain, major-road overcrossings may be
attainable only by a forced alignment and rolling gradeline. Where, otherwise
there is no pronounced advantage to the selection of either underpass or
an overpass, the design that provides the better sight distance on the
Expressway should be preferred.
•
Where topography control is secondary, the cost of bridges and approaches
may determine whether the major roadway underpasses or overpasses
the minor facility. A cost analysis that takes into account the bridge type,
span length, roadway cross section, angle of skew, soil conditions, and
cost of approaches will determine which of the two should be placed on
structure.
•
An underpass may be more advantageous where the major road can be
built close to the existing ground, with continuous gradient and with no
pronounced grade changes.
•
Where a new highway crosses an expressway carrying a large volume of
traffic, an overcrossing by the new highway causes fewer disturbances to
the existing route and a detour is usually not needed.



======================================================================

======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
•
In some instances, the lower volume facility should be carried over if there
is a pronounced economic advantage.
5.2.2
Additional design considerations for underpass
For each underpass, the type of structure used should be determined by the dimensional,
load, foundation, and general site needs for that particular location. Only the dimensional
details are reviewed herein.
Although it is an expensive element, an underpass is only one component of the total
facility and should, therefore, be consistent with the design standards of the rest of the
facility to the extent practical. It is desirable that the entire highway cross section, including
the median, carriageway, shoulders, and clear roadside areas, be carried through the
structure without change. However, several possible limitations may require some reduction
in the basic carriageway cross section: structural design limitations; vertical clearance
limitations; controls on grades and vertical clearance; limitations due to skewed crossings,
appearance, or aesthetic dimension relations; and cost factors.
5.3
TYPES OF STRUCTURES
The structures are identified by three general types: i) Deck type; ii) Through type and iii)
Partial through type. The deck type is the most commonly used. However, through and
partially through types are appropriate at rail road and interchange locations.
For the overpass highway, the deck-type structure is most suitable. Although the supports
may present both lateral and vertical clearance problems on the lower highway, they are
out of sight for motorists on the Expressway. The deck-type bridge at the upper level has
unlimited vertical clearance; lateral clearance is controlled only by location of the protective
barrier. The parapet system should provide a freedom of view from the passing vehicles
insofar as practical; however, capability to redirect errant vehicles should have precedence
over preserving the motorist’s view. The parapet and railing should have an appearance
of strength and the ability to safely redirect the design vehicle(s) under the design impact
conditions. Consideration should also be given to containing and redirecting larger vehicles
crossing the structure. In special cases where spans are long and the difference in elevation
between the two highways is to be limited, all practical designs should be compared for
suitability, including economic and aesthetic considerations.

Design of Structures
For the underpass highway, the most desirable structure from the standpoint of vehicular
operation is one that will span the entire highway cross section and provide a lateral
clearance of structural supports from the edge of roadway that is consistent with good
roadside design. The lateral clearance between the edge of roadway and the structural
supports should be as wide and flat as practical to provide usable recovery space for
errant vehicles and to prevent distraction in the motorist’s peripheral field of vision. On
divided highways, center supports should be used only where the median is wide enough
to provide sufficient lateral clearance or narrow enough to need protective barriers. The
usual lateral clearance of an underpass at piers or abutments may allow sufficient room to
construct additional lanes under the structure in the future, but at a sacrifice of recovery
space. In anticipation of future widening, the piers or abutment design should provide
footings with sufficient cover after widening.
On elevated facilities with viaduct construction, cross streets are relatively undisturbed;
however, on all other types of roadways, considerable savings can be achieved by
terminating some of the less important cross streets. Special consideration is needed
relative to the spacing and treatment of cross streets on these roadways. Major cross
streets should continue across the main line without interruption or deviation. Grade
separations should be of sufficient number and capacity to accommodate not only the
normal cross traffic but also the traffic diverted from the other cross roads terminated by
the expressway and the traffic generated by access connections to and from the
expressway.
5.3.1
Location of bridge
The location of a bridge structure is governed by the expressway alignment, which could
be one of several aspects under consideration. The bridge location should be selected to
suit the particular obstacle being crossed. Stream crossings should be located with regard
to initial capital cost of bridge works and the minimization of total cost including river
training works and the maintenance measures necessary to reduce erosion. Highway
and railroad crossings should provide for possible future upgradation works such as road
widening.
5.3.2
Structural integrity
The design procedure for structures are extensive and of varying requirement. These have been
dealt with in various literatures, text books. IRC practices and BIS code of practices. Individual

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
design of a structure, commands specialized knowledge and expertise.  Therefore, detailed
design procedures have not been dealt with in this document. However, some considerations
which may required to be ckecked at planning design stage are indicated here.
Design and details for new bridges should address structural integrity by considering
relevant codal requirements.
The following elements of design for Bridges and other Grade Separator Structures shall
be considered:
i)
Loading and hydraulic considerations;
ii)
Cross-section (Bridge type and Geometry);
iii)
Parapets and safety barriers;
iv)
Transition of protection system from road to bridge;
v)
Overpasses;
vi)
Underpasses;
vii) Other crossings;
viii) Clubbing of grade separation facilities;
ix)
Aesthetics;
x)
Durability and maintenance.
5.3.3
Loading and hydraulic considerations
The loading conditions for the bridges and other grade separator structures as well as the
hydraulic regulation for those structures crossing waterways are of prime concern. For
interchange structures, the traffic entry, exit and gore areas need considerations.
The load carrying capacity is one of the relevant elements of an expressway system
considering high percentage of transport of freight vehicles.
Indian loading conditions meet all the possible present day loading.  These are specified
in IRC:6 and shall be used for expressways in India. For impact of safety barriers, it may
require considerations from specialized literatures.
Hydraulic Regulation
The IRC codes for the design of cross-drainage structures, including type designs, have
seen periodic refinements. However, the concept of flood return period (varied accordingly



======================================================================
PAGE 279 of 528
======================================================================
II - 119
Design of Structures
to the importance of the project) has not been explicitly or consistently incorporated in the
IRC guidelines and this will be an important requirement in cross-drainage structures
design for expressways, considering the need for performance reliability at a
predetermined level of assurance. A flood return period of i) 25 years for culverts; ii) 50
years for ventages upto 30 m and iii) 100 years for wider openings (i.e. > 30 m).
5.3.4
Bridge type
The following types of structures are commonly used:
i)
Simply supported structures with various types of superstructure elements;
ii)
Cantilever construction with suspended span;
iii)
Continuous structures with simple supports over piers or having fixity with
piers;
iv)
Other long span structures requiring suspension, cable stayed, extradoses
cable system etc. which require special expertise for both design and
construction.
Simply supported structures, the most common type of structure, are the easiest to
construct and require relatively simple techniques for construction and installations; As
there are gaps between the ends of superstructure, considerable number of expansion
joints are to be installed which impair the riding quality. Expansion joints shall be kept as
minimum and designed with rider comfort considerations.
Superstructures with cantilever arms should preferably have simply supported suspended
spans.  These spans should be between 10 and 12 m to increase rider comfort.
Continuous structures are preferred over normal ground i.e. mainly for land crossings
involving other roads or railways i.e. for viaducts. Continuous structures can be constructed
on waterways where foundation can be rested on rock or very hard stratum involving very
low differential settlements.
5.3.5
Cross-section (basic geometry)
a)
Expressway Carried on Structure
The expressway is being conceived primarily of 2 x 3 lane carriageway
configuration. The users (drivers) shall not feel a difference in driving comfort.



======================================================================
PAGE 280 of 528
======================================================================
II - 120
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
All the features of expressway, prior to or after the bridge shall be carried
over the bridge.
On expressway bridges, by regulation pedestrians are not permitted. Hence
provision of walkways/footways is not made. In case directional split structure
is required, a special treatment may be necessary from drivers comfort
and the provisions made similar (or close to) expressway.
b)
Other Roads over Expressways
The cross-section shall consider the cross road geometric features including
the additional safety features such as pedestrian facilities, railings and more
importantly barrier screens of sufficient height (desirably around 2 m) to
prevent falling objects on expressway. The details have been dealt with in
Chapter-8:Safety Barrier in this Guideline.
c)
Other Roads under Expressway
The cross-road under passing expressway shall have similar features of the
cross-road in addition to safety arrangements for the abutments and piers of
the expressway. Pedestrian facilities shall be provided with guard railing to
segregate from vehicles. Vertical clearance for vehicles is of prime importance.
The cross sectional features have been included elsewhere in this guideline.
5.3.6
Transverse width of bridge
Roads with all expressway features are the safest and give the driver a sense of freedom.
Bridge railing, and parapets located close to the vehicular carriageway are potential
hazards and cause drivers to shy away from them. For long bridges which are generally
costly, some trade off may be necessary.
In arriving at a decision as to the width of the roadway over or under a grade separation,
in determining the dimensions, location, and design of the structure as a whole, and in
detailing features adjacent to the road, the designer should aim at providing a facility on
which driver reaction and vehicle placement will essentially be the same as that of the
approaching expressway.

5.3.7
Safety barriers on structures
Safety barriers consisting of longitudinal barriers (i.e. guide rail) and/or energy
attenuation devices are used where errant vehicles leaving the traveled roadway
would be subjected to a hazard that may cause excessive bodily harm or death to
the vehicle occupants.   Barriers must contain and redirect vehicles to the
carriageway.
Types
The safety barriers are broadly classed into three groups, according to the rigidity of their
horizontal elements: flexible, semi-rigid and rigid barrier.
Flexible barriers, in which the horizontal elements consist of cables under tension, are quite
safe in the case of collisions by light vehicles, but are not capable of withstanding the impact
of a heavy vehicle; the use of this type of barrier is generally not favoured in expressways.
Semi-rigid barriers, with horizontal elements made up of simple steel sections, are less
prone to buckle than flexible type, but they offer otherwise limited guarantees of resistance
in the case of impact by heavy vehicles; they shall thus be used only in the cases specified
(See Chapter-8:Safety Barriers).
Rigid barriers, which include both those with horizontal elements of steel sections reinforced
by very sturdy spacers, and those of suitably shaped reinforced concrete, should generally
be used on expressway structures.
More details are presented in Safety Barrier Chapter-8 of this Guideline.
5.4
CLUBBING OF GRADE SEPARATION FACILITIES
An expressway, specially adjacent to habitations necessarily has several cross-roads
within short distance intervals.
The local cross roads interrupted by the expressway require either an overpass or
underpass facility. As such, this is a specific planning exercise and general
recommendations on either location or spacing are not available. Provision of an
overbridge and underpass is expensive.  The cost generally compels merger of several
cross-roads to a single crossing facility.  It may be mentioned that the expressway is of
elevated viaduct construction, the cross roads are relatively undisturbed.



======================================================================
PAGE 282 of 528
======================================================================
II - 122
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
5.4.1
Considerations for merger of cross roads
The merging of cross roads may be based on the following considerations (not necessarily
meant to be exhaustive).
i)
When the cross roads are to be carried over the expressway, considerable
savings can be effected by terminating some of the less important cross
roads and to club their crossing facility to a single location.  The additional
travel or detour may preferably be limited to 1.0 km;
ii)
Determination of the number and location of cross roads to be grade
separated requires a thorough analysis of traffic on the road network. Grade
separation should be of sufficient number and capacity to handle adequately
not only the normal cross traffic but also lack of the traffic generated by
access connecting to and from the expressway and the traffic diverted to
cross road from other streets terminated due to cost effectiveness;
iii)
Arterial and other major channels of cross traffic should continue across the
expressway without interruption or significant deviation;
iv)
In so far the expressway operation is concerned there is no minimum
spacing or limit to the number of grade separated structures of cross roads
as this is generally governed by the local street system, planned or existing.
In addition to the importance of the cross roads, other factors that may affect
the number and spacing of the grade separation structure are the location
of schools, recreational areas, other public facilities, school bus routes and
fire fighting equipment routes;
v)
The provision for pedestrians require special attention and it may be
appropriate to add separate pedestrian crossings particularly where there
are large number of pedestrians, such as proximity of schools, places of
religious worship and factories.  For the most cases, pedestrians are
accommodated on the same structure which serve the vehicular traffic;
vi)
Whenever the expressway is on elevated structure, the clubbing of cross
traffic facilities may require additional spans to accommodate future
development.

Design of Structures
5.5
AESTHETICS
The bridge structures carrying elevated expressway and highways pose some aesthetic
problems and the engineers skill is required to make them aesthetically pleasant and
functionally efficient.
Aesthetic expression is an important factor which goes into determining the built form.
Architectural aesthetics is the quality or sense of beauty achieved by the interplay of space,
form, structure, light and shadow, proportions and materials.  The external appearance of
a built form is dependant on various parameters.  In the case of expressway bridging
structure, this encompasses the configuration, pattern and landscaping.
Some Aspects for Consideration of Aesthetics
While considering built form aesthetics, the following aspects are significant:
i)
Through traffic is generally given aesthetic preference by a layout in which
the more important highway is on the overpass.  Drivers have minimum
sense of restriction when they have wide angle view from the structure and
its approaches;
ii)
Where drivers take practically no notice of a structure over which they are
crossing, their behaviour is the same or nearly the same as at other points
on the highway.  On the other hand, it is virtually impossible not to notice a
structure overpassing the roadway being used. For this reason, every effort
should be made to design the structure so that it fits with the surrounding in
a pleasing and functional manner without drawing unnecessary or distracting
attention;
iii)
Interchange design is simple in flat terrain, but it may be necessary to introduce
grades that may not favour vehicle operation.  Interchanges in flat terrain
generally are not as pleasing in appearance as those fitted to rolling terrain.
When it is possible to regrade the whole of the interchange area and to
landscape it properly, most of the deficiency in appearance can be overcome;
iv)
Interchanges provide areas suitable for landscape development.  For some
conditions, the necessary two-level development is a disadvantage in regard
to appearance and may block the view.  On the other hand, due regard to



======================================================================
PAGE 284 of 528
======================================================================
II - 124
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
the architectural features in the structural design and to the flattening and
rounding of slopes for erosion control and landscape treatment can provide
a development that will almost always prove aesthetically pleasing.  Attention
to such aspects may require the use of above minimum layouts rather than
the use of the simplest or least costly type of structure or the development of
ramps with a minimum of grades/gradients;
v)
Where a city road underpasses a major roadway, the underside of the
structure is a design feature that deserves special treatment for aesthetics.
Because of numerous pedestrians and slower moving traffic, the underside
of a structure as viewed from the cross road is especially noticeable to the
local citizens.  It should be as open as feasible to allow the maximum amount
of light and air below.  An open-type structural design is also needed to
improve the sight distance, especially if there are intersections adjacent to
the structure.
5.6
DURABILITY AND MAINTENANCE
Durability of the structure is one of the major aspects for a bridge intended to carry an
expressway through it. Minimum cement content as specified in various IS, IRC, ASTM
and BS reference codes may be taken care of. Suitable method of concrete mix design
should be adhered to so as to promote minimum voids and high yield of the mix, keeping
addition of water to a minimum to ensure smooth workability.
Maintenance
This aspect requires extensive deliberation and is addressed in a separate Volume. The
current practices need to be studied and integrated with improvement measures.
Adequate maintenance planning and organisation are the requirements for the expressway
structures. Planned maintenance which is defined as the work organised with forethought,
control and records comprises two essential elements:
i)
Planned preventive maintenance;
ii)
Planned corrective maintenance.
Both of these must be organised in a proper way and should be mutually balanced and
capable of simultaneous execution.



======================================================================
PAGE 285 of 528
======================================================================
II - 125
Design of Structures
The main objectives of maintenance planning are:
i)
To preserve the investment;
ii)
To provide adequate level of safety to users;
iii)
To provide adequate level of driving comfort to users;
iv)
To ensure economy in expenditure and resources.
5.7
INSPECTION FACILITIES FOR MAINTENANCE
For preventive maintenance, visual inspection of the bridging structure is an important
component. Visual inspection is effective when it is carried from close quarters often
referred as hand shaking distance. For long span structure, moving inspection platforms
suspended from the underside of the bridge are employed.  However, most of the bridges
for the expressway will be related with grade separator for the cross traffic where these
suspended moving platforms are not suitable as these are likely to foul with the vertical
clearances available. Moreover, as the length for these grade separating structures will
generally be less than 50 m, the conventional system with access ladder and stairs may
be both economical and practical.

EXPRESSWAY – IN TUNNELS
Expressways may require sections to be constructed in tunnels either to carry the alignment
under or through a natural obstacle or to minimize the impact on the community.
The general conditions under which tunnel construction may be warranted are:
•
Long, narrow mountainous terrain where a cut section may be expensive
or leads to environmental consequences.
•
Narrow right-of-way, where all  the surface area must be retained for road
purpose
•
Railroad yard, airport and runways, or similar facilities
•
Parks or other land uses, existing or planned
•
Right-of-way acquisition costs exceed cost of tunnel construction and operation

Tunnels
Escape and Guidance Facilities
•
Guide board: in an emergency, these direct road users in the tunnel the
distance/direction to an exit or evacuation route, the current position, and
other information.
•
Escape Passage: there are evacuation tunnels and evacuation exits for the
road users in the tunnel to a safe place.  The former is built for escape,
separately from the main tunnel, while the latter connects the main tunnel to
an evacuation tunnel which runs in parallel with it, or two main tunnels. The
evacuation tunnel may have a vertical clearance of 4.5 m. The exit for
evacuation shall be shutter type of light weight and inflammable materials.
Adequate signage for direction of movement and easy opening mechanism
shall be provided.  Separate escape tunnel may be considered only for long
tunnel.  Providing escape tunnel below the tunnel operating surface may be
considered only for the tunnel constructed by the shield tunneling method.
Evacuation tunnel shall be used only by the evacuating persons and emergency
vehicles.  A typical example of ‘adit’ in Japan is shown below:

TUNNEL CROSS SECTIONS
There can be two types of tunnel cross sections based on construction practices:
i)
Tunnels constructed by mining method;

Tunnels constructed by cut-and-cover method.
Road tunnel cross sections contain “in breadth” a certain number of elements which
need considerations during an optimization study of the geometric characteristics of
the profile.
Two unidirectional tunnels (tubes) are spaced at minimum three times the dimension of
the tunnel at carriageway level as shown in Fig. 6.03.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
From safety considerations, paved shoulder width of 3.0 m on left and 0.75 m on right, as
provided on expressway sections other than tunnel shall desirably be carried through the
tunnel.  However, on cost considerations, for long tunnels (more than 500 m) the 3.0 m
wide paved shoulder on left side may be reduced to 1.0 m with provisions for layby of 2.0
m width at 750 m interval.  The escape footway shall continue adjacent to the layby. The
layby is intended for maintenance vehicles as well as damaged vehicles.   Fig. 6.03 and
6.04 present typical cross-sections.
Users consider tunnel as a hazard and therefore, deserves all considerations.
The following considerations would be useful.
•
A smoothly aligned tunnel approach has no major impact on the transverse
positions of vehicles.
•
However, a sudden narrowing of the tunnel wall has a significant impact upon
the transverse position of vehicles, resulting in a shift from the tunnel wall.
•
Inside tunnels, after a period of adoption to the adjacent tunnel walls, the
mean transverse position of light vehicles does not significantly differ from
the mean transverse position on the open road.  However, inside a tunnel,
transverse positions show a relatively small spread compared with the open
road.
•
Heavy vehicles drive closer to the left side lane compared to light vehicles.
•
Inside tunnel overtaking shall be prohibited.
•
The maximum permissible gradient shall be 3 percent considering emission
effect and safety considerations on down grade.
The above considerations lead to the following important aspects:
a)
Tunnel Approach shall have the following characteristics
-
Smoothly aligned tunnel walls without any sudden narrowing to avoid a
shift from the tunnel wall
-
A good day/night visibility of the edge lines and inside the tunnel will
eliminate hazard feeling of users. The tunnel wall lining shall be of white
colour with high luminous reflectance.

Inside Tunnel
-
The same cross section (carriageway and paved shoulder) of the
expressway before and after the tunnel location shall desirably be
continued as stated earlier.
Dimensions of Road Tunnels
The internal cross sectional dimensions of road tunnel shall consider the followings:
-
the number and width of traffic lanes
-
the lateral and vertical clearances for vehicles
-
the space to be provided for ventilation ducts, escape footway, emergency
layby lighting and drainage, and fire and other services
The above aspects also require consideration on method of construction i.e. by mining or
cut-and-cover method.
Lateral Clearance
The most currently used forms of lateral clearances are footways (low or high), raised
edges and emergency stopping layby at the same level as the carriageways.
Raised Walkways
Raised walkways are at a higher level relative to the carriageway (around 1.00 m) and
therefore remain very useful for the maintenance as inspection gallery as well as escape
footway.  Near the escape door, steps shall be provided along the tunnel for user
convenience.
Raised Edges and Safety Fences
The function of raised edges and safety fances is basically protection of the tunnel walls
and vehicles from damage.  They are not intended to be used by the pedestrians.  Their
width is normally about 0.75 m.

Traffic Regulations
Overhead Traffic Signage
It is necessary to provide traffic lights above each lane at the entry portal end as well as
inside, to be able to inform the traffic of lane blockage due to serious accident or
maintenance operations/activities.
It is useful to complement the signage system with a yellow light, above each lane, to
announce an abnormal situation, which should not necessarily lead to a reduction of the
number of lanes (breakdown or damaged car parked along the wall) but to warn of possible
hazards ahead.
Markings
To provide markings consisting of a discontinuous line separating the traffic lanes and
a continuous line separating the lateral traffic lane from the paved shoulder and
emergency laybye.  These lane markings shall be of such material as to provide good
day/night visibility.
Over and above, the space for the service ducts, lighting, ventilation and other utility services
such as communication facilities, emergency fire fighting arrangement are to be provided
in considering the size of the tunnel.
Emergency utility power and waterline shall be provided encased in fireproof arrangement.
For Rectangular sections (for cut and cover method), a special configuration for urban
area with limitations to go deeper, the size may be decided enveloping all the requirements
mentioned above.
Based on the above, tunnel cross-sections are given in Fig. 6.04 and Fig. 6.05.

TUNNEL WATERPROOFING AND DRAINAGE
An efficient and effective water proofing and drainage system is required in all road tunnels
for removal of water from rainfall, seepage, tunnel washing operations, vehicle drippings/
spillage or fire-fighting operations. To economize on cost, the drainage of tunnels is

Tunnels
generally achieved by gravity flow system. The roadway is generally drained by draining
water on one side and provision of series of catch-basins to pick-up any run-off water. In
addition, subsurface trench drains are provided under the roadway to remove any
hydrostatic pressures that could damage the pavement.  Good water proofing of tunnels
is essential from operational consideration as also for structural protection from
surrounding weathering effects. To accomplish this, various interior and exterior water
proofing techniques are used to resist hydrostatic and earth pressures.   This can be
provided through appropriate lining.
6.6.1
Lining
Tunnel secondary lining and interior lighting improves visibility inside the tunnel.  This
beautifies tunnel interior and gives comfortable vision to the drivers, improves visibility for
safe driving, and lighting inside the tunnel.

Typical arrangements of tunnel drainage for expressway are presented in Fig. 6.04 and
Fig. 6.05.
To prevent water leaks in road tunnels and cracks in lining, waterproofing comprising a
waterproof sheet of at least 0.8 mm thick with synthetic textile buffer, is provided between
shotcrete and lining. Cast-in-place unreinforced concrete is used as the material for lining
though reinforced concrete is employed and places under high earth pressure or close to
the portals. Typical arrangements are shown below:
6.7
TUNNEL VENTILATION
The objective of ventilation in tunnels is to provide fresh air so as to reduce the effect of
contaminants so that they are within permissible limits both during construction and
operation of expressway facility. The ventilation during construction of facility termed as
“temporary ventilation” is required to reduce air pollution due to explosives, smoke, fumes,
dust and spillage caused by operating equipment and vehicles. This pollution adversely
affects the health, working conditions and efficiency of crew and other supervisory staff.
The ventilation during operation of highway/expressway facility termed as permanent
ventilation is required to reduce the effect of contaminants such as Carbon Monoxide
(CO), Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Lead Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and other
obnoxious gases and substances caused by vehicle emissions together with soots and
spillage during operation. These contaminants while present beyond allowable limits
adversely affect health (headache, faintness and unconsciousness), visual performance
of motorists, efficiency and safety of users.

Vehicle emissions, exhaust emissions and emission rates
Usually, CO (which adversely affects the human body) and soot (which reduces visibility)
are the prime considerations for tunnel ventilation.  NOx, which is less harmful and have
lower concentration in exhaust than CO, will also be removed with ventilation of CO.
Sometimes the soot concentration triggers for ventilation.
The majority of the soot is discharged from commercial vehicles.  The design concentration
of soot is expressed by means of the visibility index  (the larger the number, the cleaner
the air).  It is also noted that its values are fixed corresponding to combinations of design
speeds and traffic volumes.
Commercial and passenger vehicles discharge CO equally and the design concentration
does not depend on design speed or traffic volume.  Table 6.02 presents typical values
for Design Concentration Soot and CO, which triggers for ventilation provisions.

Tunnel ventilation systems
The objective of ventilation is to dilute or remove the harmful substances in exhaust gas from
vehicles, in order to prevent the harmful substances from producing biologically adverse
effects on users and maintenance personnel and to maintain good visibility in the tunnel.
There are two ventilation systems: the natural ventilation system that depends only on
traffic ventilation power, and the mechanical ventilation system using machines.  The
mechanical ventilation system is divided into four basic systems according to the direction
of ventilation wind relative to the axial direction of the tunnel: the longitudinal flow system,
the transverse flow system, the semi-transverse flow system, and combinations of these.

System
Longitudinal System: using the space in the roadway as a duct for ventilation, the system
ventilates through traffic ventilation power and mechanical air supply power.
Transverse System: exclusive ducts for the supply and discharge of air are provided
separate from roadway space.  Ventilation is carried out by sending fresh air across the
roadway space from the air supply duct to the exhaust duct.
Natural Ventilation: naturally ventilated tunnels rely primarily on meteorological conditions
and the piston effect of the moving traffic to maintain satisfactory environmental conditions
within the tunnel. The prime meteorological condition affecting the tunnel is the pressure
differential between the two tunnel portals created by differences in elevation, ambient
temperatures, or wind. Unfortunately, none of these factors can be relied on for consistent
results. A sudden change in wind direction or velocity can rapidly negate all of these natural
effects including, to some extent, the piston effect. The total of all pressures must be of
sufficient magnitude to overcome the tunnel resistance, which is influenced by tunnel
longitudinal coefficient of friction, hydraulic diameter, and air density. None of the natural
effects defined above can be considered when addressing emergency ventilation.
Air flow through a naturally ventilated tunnel can be portal to portal (Fig. 6.06A(i)) or portal
to shaft (Fig. 6.06A(ii)). The portal-to-portal flow-type system functions with unidirectional
traffic, which produces a consistent, positive air flow.

(Mechanical Ventilation)

======================================================================
II - 145
Tunnels
The naturally ventilated tunnel with an intermediate shaft (Fig. 6.06A (ii)) is best suited for
bidirectional traffic. However, the air flow through such a shafted tunnel is also at the mercy
of the elements. The added benefit of the “stack effect” of the shaft depends on air
temperature differentials, rock temperatures, wind direction and velocity, and shaft height.
Because of the numerous uncertainties outlined above, the reliance on natural ventilation
for tunnels more than 240 m (PIARC-1999) long should be thoroughly evaluated, specifically
the effect of adverse meteorological and operating conditions.
Longitudinal Ventilation. A longitudinal ventilation system is a system where the air is introduced
to or removed from the tunnel roadway at a limited number of points, thus creating a longitudinal
air flow within the roadway (Fig. 6.06B (i)). The injection-type longitudinal system developed for
(Fig. 6.06B (ii)) railroad tunnels; has also found application in highway tunnels. Air is injected
into the tunnel roadway at one end of the tunnel, where it mixes with the air brought in by the
piston effect of the incoming traffic. This system is most effective in a tunnel with unidirectional
traffic. The air velocity within the roadway is uniform throughout the tunnel, and the concentration
of contaminants increases from ambient at the entering portal to maximum at the exiting portal.
Adverse external atmospheric conditions can reduce the effectiveness of this system. The
concentration of contaminants increases as the air flow decreases or the tunnel length increases.
Fig. 6.06B Longitudinal Ventilation System
(Mechnical Ventilation)
The longitudinal system with a shaft (Fig. 6.06B(i)) is similar to the naturally ventilated
system with a shaft except that it provides a positive stack effect (fan induced). With
bidirectional traffic, peak contaminant concentration occurs near the shaft location. This
system is generally not used for unidirectional tunnels, because the contaminant levels
become unbalanced and excessive amounts of air will therefore be required for ventilation.
An alternative longitudinal system uses two shafts located near the center of the tunnel,
one for exhausting and one for supplying, Fig. 6.06B(ii). This configuration will provide a
reduction of contaminant concentration in the second half, because a portion of the tunnel



======================================================================
PAGE 306 of 528
======================================================================
II - 146
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
air flow is exchanged with ambient air at the shaft. Adverse wind conditions can cause a
reduction of air flow, a rise in contaminant concentration in the second half of the tunnel,
and “short circuiting” of the fan air flows.
Semi-transverse Ventilation using Axial-flow Fans
As a general rule, semi-transverse ventilation systems using Axial-flow-fans, introduce
sufficient fresh air into the tunnel to dilute the emitted pollutant loads. Thus diluted, the
tunnel air exits through both portals. A controlled flow of fresh air is introduced continuously
into a separate air duct from which the requisite partial volumes are forced into the roadway
tunnel via so-called secondary ducts. (Fig. 6.07A)
To ensure that the direction of flow can be controlled in the case of a fire, reversible axial-flow fan
systems are employed. Under normal conditions, these units operate as supply fans. If necessary,
during fire, these axial fans can be switched to exhaust mode, extracting air via the ducts.
Compared with longitudinal ventilation using jet fans, such systems offer the advantage of
producing lower longitudinal airflow velocities since the air can exit through both portals. In the
semi transverse system, the air supply to the tunnel is not affected by adverse meteorological
conditions or opposing traffic. With this advantage, the semi transverse ventilation system can
be used for long tunnels and its successful use has been reported for tunnels upto 2 km in length.
Fully Transverse Ventilation using Centrifugal Fans
With fully transverse ventilation, fresh air is supplied to each point of the roadway in exactly
the extracted quantity. Fresh air is introduced into distribution ducts extending along each
tube’s length and blown into the tunnel through air-supply openings (Fig. 6.07B).

======================================================================
PAGE 307 of 528
======================================================================
II - 147
Tunnels
The exhaust air carrying pollutant loads is continuously extracted over the length of the
tunnel via exhaust vents. The individual exhaust air flows are combined in plenums running
parallel to the tunnel, then discharged via exhaust stacks.
In one variant of the fully transverse ventilation method, referred to as “reduced transverse
ventilation”, the rated exhaust air flows are less than the supply-air volume. The excess of
air leaves the tunnel via the portals.
Forced Ventilation
In recent years, a clear trend towards longitudinal ventilation has emerged for medium
tunnel lengths of around 3 km.
The success of this ventilation method is partly attributable to the lower capital outlay,
operating overhead and maintenance cost involved.
Jet fans arranged individually or in groups (Fig. 6.08) at specified distances along the
tunnel’s to impart energy pulses to the air column, thus including airflow movement. With
this design, care must be taken in determining fan spacing along the tunnel axis to ensure
good intermixing of the jet discharge and the remaining tunnel airflow, as well as an optimum
flow distribution across the tunnel.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The length of jet fan ventilated tunnels is limited by the maximum longitudinal air velocity,
since the speed of the airflow must not exceed accepted safety and comfort levels. For
the sake of completeness, the longitudinal air management method based on Saccardo
nozzles should likewise be mentioned here.
Saccardo nozzles (Fig. 6.09A) are fed by axial-flow fans mounted at the tunnel portal. The
nozzle injects the fan intake into the roadway tube at a 15 to 20-degree angle to the tunnel
axis and air speeds between 25 and 30 m/sec via a circular gap in the upper portal area.
Another interesting recent development in longitudinal road ventilation is the use of exhaust
air fans mounted in caverns and operating via central ducting (Fig. 6.09B). In this system,
fresh air is drawn in from both portals by large axial-flow fans arranged in caverns near the
middle of the tunnel. Exhaust air is extracted and discharged via an outlet shaft. A benefit
of this system lies in the fact that on exhaust, air exits from the portals and that the length
of the ventilation air-way is virtually reduced by half, with the advantageous reduction on

Irrespective of the foregoing, the other ventilation techniques, viz.
-
reduced semi-transverse ventilation
-
semi-transverse ventilation
-
fully transverse ventilation
each have their own specific advantages over all-longitudinal ventilation in terms of fire safety, ride
comfort and environmental compatibility and will therefore be adopted or specified on a case-by-
case basis. Needless to say, combinations between longitudinal and semi-transverse ventilation
may be found effective both under normal operating conditions and in the event of a fire.
Summary Selection Criteria for Ventilation Systems
The choice of a tunnel ventilation system is essentially determined by the following factors:
-
fresh-air demand as a function of CO, NOx and opacity-inducting emissions,
taking into account legal requirements and the anticipated trend in emission
levels and control thresholds over the next few years;
-
reliability of the system;
-
safety in case of fire;
-
energy consumption;
-
investment cost;
-
maintenance;
-
service friendliness
For short (around 240 m) tunnels, either natural or traffic-induced ventilation may prove adequate.
Longer tunnels will require one of the three basic types of mechanical ventilation. Longitudinal
tunnel CO and improved visibility levels. It is often combined with additional jet fans inside
the tunnel which are activated in the case of a fire to keep escape routes clear of smoke.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
ventilation is the simplest form. Fresh air enters one portal and exhaust air flows out at the other
portal. Booster fans may be installed at points along the tunnel length to increase the air flow.
Practical limitations to this system include the maximum air speed that can be tolerated by
maintenance workers and the increase in fire hazards. Transverse ventilation is the most common
mechanical system for long tunnels. Two separate air ducts with fan systems are required, one
forcing fresh air into the tunnel and one drawing exhaust air out. Both ducts are connected to the
traffic space at regular intervals to minimize the longitudinal flow of contaminated air.  Semi-transverse
ventilation requires a single fresh air duct connected to the traffic space at regular intervals. Exhaust
air is forced out at the portals or drawn from the traffic space at intermediate shafts.
Ventilation requirements for long tunnels should be thoroughly evaluated at an early point in the
design phase. The energy requirement for mechanical ventilation varies in direct proportion to
the fourth power of tunnel length and in inverse proportion to the square of the duct area.

FIRE RESISTANCE OF TUNNEL STRUCTURE AND APPURTENANCES
6.8.1
Tunnel structures
The objectives for fire resistance of tunnel structures are:
•
To make evacuation or protection of tunnel users possible.
•
To make rescue and firefighting operations possible and ensure their safety.
•
To limit damage to tunnel structure and equipment, and to surrounding buildings.
It is generally acceptable that repairs are necessary after a large fire, but not that whole
tunnel is lost.
In the tunnel with two lanes constructed by the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM),
unreinforced concrete lining with a thickness of 300 mm was normally installed inside the
tunnel. In the tunnel constructed by the conventional tunneling method, unreinforced concrete
lining with a thickness of more than 450 mm was used as the main structure of the tunnel. For
these tunnels, no special fire resistant protection has been provided, because a local collapse
of concrete lining caused by a fire will generally have much smaller consequences on safety
and property of the rock tunnels and it will be repaired more easily and in a short time.

PORTALS
Functionally, the portal is regarded as a sort of retaining wall to protect at entrance and
exit. Its purpose is to reduce the luminance of facing walls. These days, importance is
attached to harmony with the surrounding environment, and portals are designed and
constructed to convey drivers about the presence of a tunnel.
The commonly-employed method of building portals avoids making cuts near the entrance
as much as possible, to limit/protect loose soil/rocks.  In some cases, entrance have to be
built in unfavorable positions which are threatened by the possibility of landslide or slope
failure, are under uneven earth pressure, or poor ground bearing capacity.  Dealing with
these construction problems is another important task.
Moreover, on aesthetic considerations, a tunnel portal becomes a locational feature also.  The
users may refer the portal shape to locate the tunnel.  Table 6.03 presents Typical Tunnel Portals
used in Japan combining functional as well as visual aesthetics for different ground conditions.

CHAPTER – 7
DRAINAGE AND EROSION PROTECTION
7.1
INTRODUCTION
Water is always present in soil and granular pavement materials in some form, but the forms
that concern the pavement design are free water, capillary water, bound moisture, and water
vapour.
Free water in the base, subbase and subgrade is of particular concern because it can
decrease the pavement strength in the following ways:
i)
Reducing the apparent cohesion by lowering the capillary forces;
ii)
Reducing the friction by reducing the effective mass of the materials below
the water table;
iii)
For quickly applied loads, possibly reducing the strength by the development
of increased and/or oscillating pore pressures.
Since water is the prime factor causing failure of pavements, attempts should be made to
keep the water away from the road-bed. This can be achieved by undertaking the following
measures:
i)
The surface run-off over the pavement surface and the shoulders should be
drained away as quickly as possible, preventing ingress of the water into
the pavement layers;
ii)
Precipitation over the open land adjoining the highway should be led away
from the highway through natural drainage channels or artificial drains.
Suitable cross-drainage structure should be provided to lead the natural
drainage channel across the highway embankment;
iii) Consideration should be given to deal with the precipitation and
surface flow on the embankment and cut slopes to minimise/eliminate
erosion;
iv)
Seepage and sub-surface water is detrimental to the stability of cut slopes
and bearing power of subgrades. Similarly, it can be of great importance in
preventing frost action. An effective system of sub-surface drainage is a
guarantee against such failures;

v)
Alignment of the road can have a vital bearing on the problem of drainage.
So in case of new road, surface drainage should be one of the criteria in
fixing proper alignment;
vi)
Landslide-prone zones deserve special investigations for improving uphill
drainage;
vii) Poor embankment soils can be made to perform satisfactorily with adequate
drainage provision;
viii) Water-logged and flood-prone areas require special consideration for
improving the overall drainage pattern of the area.  An alternative alignment
may also be explored to avoid complex and expensive drainage
arrangements through such areas.
Highway drainage design should incorporate safety, appearance, control of pollutant, and
economy in maintenance.  The interrelationship between the drainage channel and the
side slopes is important for safety aspects of vehicles leaving the roadway.
Drainage Channels include:
i)
Road side channels in cut sections to remove water from the roadway;
ii)
Toe-of-slope channels to convey the water from any cut section and from
adjacent slopes to natural water courses;
iii)
Intercepting channels placed uphill at the back of the top of cut slopes to
intercept surface waters;
iv)
Chutes to carry collected water down steep cut or fill slopes.
In rural and urban situation, the shape and size may be changed to meet the specific
requirements.
Road Side Channels
For an efficient road channel from hydraulics consideration, the open channel ditches with
steep slopes are generally used.
Considering the safety of errant vehicles sides slope of 1V:4H or flatter and a 3.0 m shoulder
with rounded edge are generally considered.  Side slope of 1V:5H to 1V:6H are
recommended to reduce snow drifts.  The depth and hydraulic gradient of channel should



======================================================================

======================================================================

Drainage and Erosion Protection
be sufficient to remove the water without saturation of subgrade.  The channel grade does
not have to follow the road profile.  Not only can the depth and breadth of the channel be
varied to meet different amounts of runoff, slopes of channel, types of lining, and distances
between discharge points, but also the lateral distance between the channel and the edge
of the carriageway can also be varied.
The cross-sections are presented in Fig. 7.01 and Fig. 7.02.
7.2
ROAD SIDE AND MEDIAN DRAINS
7.2.1
Road side drains - rural expressways
Roadside drainage channels should be economical to construct and require a minimum
of maintenance, in addition to adequately performing their primary function as conveyance
facilities.
These channels, depending on topography and terrain will discharge into either natural
streams or open area. The practice suggests on:
a)
Preservation of natural valleys, ravines, stream channels, flood plains and
wetlands to the extent possible;
b)
Minimizing the provision of storm sewers where other alternatives such as
open channels are feasible.
7.2.2
Kerbs and channels (for wayside amenities and other areas)
Expressways in general do not require the provision of kerb and channel except for
drainage at valley curve locations, provision of raised medians on emergency median
openings, at gore area locations, on exit ramps, on median terminal areas at the
commencement of toll plaza, on raised footway at the periphery of toll plaza etc.
In such situations, on road safety considerations, mountable type barriers are desirable.
The typical details are presented in Figs. 7.03A, 7.03B and 7.03C.
Kerbs with or without channels along entrance roadways and around parking lots in rest
areas provide excellent traffic delineation. The raised walkway and footpath provides
visual and aesthetic benefits.
Many sources are available that recommend the types of kerb requirement on parking area lot
dimensions, types of drainage system etc. Site specific appropriate details may be developed.

Drainage and Erosion Protection
7.2.3
Chutes and flumes
In high embankment and approaches to bridge, if water is allowed to leave the carriageway
at undefined spots, it may do serious damage to the embankment and eventually
undermines the pavement.
In each location, rain water is collected through longitudinal kerb channel and brought
down through chute.  The chute may be lined with cement concrete on stable supports and
may be located at 10 to 15 m interval depending upon rainfall, width, cross slope and
longitudinal gradient of carriageway.
Some provision for energy dissipation or scour protection may be necessary at the outlet
end. On long slopes, closed (pipe) flumes are generally desirable to open sections because
the high velocity flow may overtop the open channel, erode the adjacent earth slope beyond
the protection measures and destroy the entire structure.
The inlet of all chutes and flumes, open or closed, must be designed to guide the
approaching flow from bypassing the flume or overtopping the structure occurred on steep
longitudinal gradient.  The other design requirements shall satisfy IRC:SP:42-1994 and
IRC:SP:50-1999.
Typical cross-sections for chute are shown in Figs. 7.03D and 7.03E.
7.2.4
Median drainage
A depressed median is generally preferred on expressway for more efficient drainage
and snow removal.  Median slopes should preferably be 1:6 but slopes of 1:4 may be
adequate.
Inlet spacing can be determined by the design discharge, longitudinal slope, capacity of
the median channel and the flow velocity in the median channel.
Typical median drainage out fall through cross-drainage works and detail of median
drainage arrangement with catch pit are shown in Figs. 7.04A and  7.04B.
7.3
DESIGN OF DRAINAGE
The design of drainage system such as surface and sub-surface drainge for pavement, median,
shoulder, high embankment shall be carried out in accordance with IRC:SP:42 and IRC:SP:50.
Surface runoff from the project highway, embankment slopes and the service roads shall be

discharged through longitudinal drains, which shall be designed for adequate cross-section,
bed slopes, invert levels and the outfalls.  If necessary, the walls of the drains shall be designed
to retain the adjoining earth.  Where drains are required to be the covered, the cover of the
drain shall be designed for carrying the maximum expected wheel load.  The covered drains
shall be provided with iron gratings, strong enough to withstand expected loading.
Basic steps in the design of roadway drainage and storm sewer are as follows:
i)
The rainfall for the desired return period is adopted for design;
ii)
The maximum allowable encroachment of gutter flow onto the traffic lanes
for the design runoff is selected;
iii)
The locations and spacing of sewer inlets are established;
iv)
The storm sewer is designed to accommodate the design runoff;
v)
The flow path followed by the major [50 (special case 100 year)] flood is
examined to ensure that no significant damage or hazard will occur;
vi)
The outfall is designed to minimize erosion problems;
vii) The effect of the drainage system on the receiving channel is evaluated and
erosion control measures introduced where necessary.
7.3.1
Hydraulics of storm sewers
The most common type of flow in storm sewer systems is open channel flow, i.e. flow
exposed to atmospheric pressure.
In steady uniform flow in drains of all shapes flowing either full or partially full, the mean
velocity of flow is calculated from the Manning’s formula as :
where
n
= Mannings roughness coefficient
S
= The slope of lined open channel (m/m)
R = The hydraulic radius (m)
A
= Cross-sectional area of flow (sqm)
P
= Wetted perimeter (m)
R = A/P

Drainage and Erosion Protection
The discharge flow i.e. capacity (Q) is calculated using Equation 2.01.
Q = A V
Where
Q = Discharge in m3/s
For shallow triangular channels where the flow width may exceed 40 times the maximum
depth, the Manning’s formula gives inaccurate result. The following modified formula may
be adopted for better assessment.
where
Q = Discharge in (m3/s)
So
 = Slope (m/m)
Sx = Crossfall
n = Mannings roughness coefficient
d = Maximum flow depth (m)
The values of n are given in Table 7.01 and the solution of the Equation 2.02 can be
obtained by the nomogram given in Fig. 7.05A.
7.3.2
Runoff
The rate of runoff largely governs the cost of the drainage works. Various methods are
available for estimating run-off for storm drain design, ranging from simple empirical
formulae to hydrograph techniques and complex computer models. Highway drain systems
draining areas up to 50 Ha are generally based on the Rational Method.
7.3.3
The rational method
This method states that the peak flow Q equals a fraction C of the rate of supply of water
to the water shed area A
      Q = 0.0028 A.C.i
Eq…. 2.03
where
Q = Peak flow (m3/s),
C = Run-off coefficient
i = Rainfall intensity (mm/h) and
A = Drainage area (Ha)

Watershed area
The area of the watershed may be determined from project plans, municipal drainage
maps (for urban arterials), contour maps and maps of the watershed.
7.3.5
Runoff coefficient
The runoff coefficient may range from 0.05 or less for open sand to 0.95 for steep paved
surfaces.  Values of C may be taken from Table 7.02.  The table considers topography,
vegetation, soil, landuse and storm frequency to some extent, but does not consider surface
detention or storage. The choice of C must be based on experience. Normally, the runoff
coefficient should be based on existing conditions.
If the area to be drained comprises several types of surfaces, a composite runoff coefficient
may be calculated as:
where
A
= Total areas of watershed
C1, C2, …Cn = Corresponding runoff coefficient
C
= Overall runoff coefficient
7.3.6
Time of concentration
In storm sewer systems, the time of concentration “Tc” consists of the time taken for storm
water to reach the inlet, termed the inlet time “Ti”, plus the time of flow in the sewer to the
point in question. Inlet time varies accordingly to the slope, permeability and ground cover
of the surfaces, the length of the flow path, and rainfall intensity. Typical inlet times that may
be used in the design are given in Table 7.03.
7.3.7
Rainfall frequency and intensity
The rainfall intensity “i” to be used in the Rational formula depends on the selected design
storm frequency, the time of concentrations of the watershed and the intensity - frequency
relationship of rainfall at the location of the project.
The design storm frequency should be selected on the basis of road classification and other
factors. Rainfall intensities corresponding to a given storm frequency.  Tc should be obtained
from intensity, duration frequency curves that may be available with meteorological stations.

7.4
CULVERTS AND CROSS DRAINAGE STRUCTURES
The function of a culvert is to convey surface water across or from the highway right-of-
way. In addition to this hydraulic function, it must also carry construction and highway traffic
and earth loads; therefore, culvert design involves both hydraulic and structural design.
The hydraulic and structural designs must be such that risks to traffic, of property damage
and of failure from floods are consistent with good engineering practice and economics.
Structures measuring more than 6.0 m along the roadway centreline are conventionally
classified as bridges in IRC: 5.
7.4.1
Culvert location, plan and type
Location
Culvert locations are fixed considering the alignment of both the stream and the highway.
The horizontal and vertical alignment are important in maintaining a sediment-free culvert.
The following factors contribute to deposition in culverts:
i)
At moderate flow rates, the culvert cross section is larger than that of the
stream, thus the flow depth and sediment transport capacity is reduced;
ii)
Point bars form on the inside of stream bends and culvert inlets placed at
bends in the stream will be subjected to deposition in the same manner.
This effect is most pronounced in multiple-barrel culverts with the barrel on
the inside of the curve often becoming almost totally plugged with sediment
deposits;
iii)
Abrupt changes to a flatter grade in the culvert or in the channel adjacent to
the culvert will induce deposition. Gravel and cobble deposits are common
downstream from the break in grade because of the reduced transport
capacity in the flatter section.
Plan
Location plan deals basically with the route that the flow takes in crossing the right-of-way.
Regardless of the degree of skew/meandering of the natural channel within the right-of-
way, a crossing is generally accomplished by using a straight culvert either normal to or
skewed with the roadway centreline preferably placed in the natural channel.

Where location in the natural channel would require a long culvert, channelisation of some
stream may be required with adequate inlet and outlet design.
Culvert Type
Selection of Culvert type includes the choice of material, shape and cross section and the
number of culvert barrels combined with fill height, terrain, foundation condition, fish
passage, shape of the existing channel, roadway profile, allowable head-water, stream
stage discharge and frequency discharge relationships, cost and service life.
Several commonly used culvert shapes are:
i)
Circular;
ii)
Pipes of arch and elliptical shape;
iii)
Rectangular or square box;
iv)
Arches.
7.4.2
Cross drainage structures
Cross-drainage structures are designed to carry water underneath the roadway and vary
in size from 900 mm concrete or corrugated metal pipes to multi-barreled concrete box
culverts or structural plate pipes.  Typically, their inlets and outlets consist of concrete
head walls and wing walls for the larger structures and bevelled end sections.
Traversable Designs
A roadside designed with optimal safety features could be defined as the one that is
almost flat, completely traversable from the edge of the carriageway to the right of way
line, and would include sufficient area for all desirable clear zone distance requirements.
If a slope is generally traversable, the preferred treatment for any cross drainage structure
is to extend (or shorten) it to intercept the roadway embankment and to match the inlet
or outlet slope to the embankment slope.   For cross drainage structure, a small pipe
culvert is defined as a single round pipe or multiple round pipes of 900 mm diameter.
Extending or shortening culverts to locate the inlets/outlets a fixed distance from the
traveled way is not recommended if such treatment introduces discontinuities in an
otherwise traversable slope.

Drainage and Erosion Protection
Extension of Structures
For intermediate sized pipes and culverts whose inlets and outlets cannot readily be made
traversable, an option often exercised by the highway designer is to extend the structure
so that the obstacle is located at or just beyond the appropriate clear zone. While this
practice reduces the likelihood of the pipe end being hit, it does not completely eliminate
its possibility. The clear zone distance should not be viewed as a discrete, exact distance,
but as the center of a zone which should then be analysed on a site specific basis.
If the extended culvert headwall remains the only significant man-made fixed object immediately
at the edge of the clear zone along the section of roadway under design, and the roadside is
generally traversable to the right of way line elsewhere, simply extending the culvert to the
edge of the clear zone may not be the best alternative, particularly on freeways and other high
speed, access controlled facilities. On the other hand, if the roadway has numerous fixed
objects, both natural and man-made, at the edge of the clear zone, extending individual structures
to the same minimum distance from traffic may be appropriate. However, redesigning the
inlet/outlet so that it is no longer an obstacle is usually the preferred safety treatment.
Shielding
For major drainage structures which are costly to extend and whose end sections cannot
be made traversable, shielding with an appropriate traffic barrier is the most effective
safety treatment. Although the traffic barrier is longer and closer to the roadway than the
structure opening and is likely to be hit more often than an unshielded culvert located
further from the traveled way, a properly designed, installed and maintained barrier system
may provide an increased level of safety for the errant motorist.
7.4.3
Catch water drain
Catch water drains, are also known as interceptor drains located on the high side of
cuttings clear of the top of batters to intercept the flow of surface water and upper soil
seepage water.  These are generally located at level of 2.0 m from the edge of the cutting
to minimise possible under cutting of the top of the batter.
These are lined, if necessary, depending upon hydraulic design (velocity) and soil type.
The discharge from the drain will be led to the nearest natural channel.
7.4.4
Rainwater harvesting and conservation
To dispose of the rainwater from the road surface and the embankment slope, toe drains
are provided unless the topography is such that the runoff can flow to natural outfalls.



======================================================================
PAGE 338 of 528
======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
These toe drains, once provided, have their outfall in the waterway or natural basin. To
conserve these runoffs as an alternative proposed to be conserved.  The details have
been explained in Appendix-7.
7.5
SUB-SURFACE DRAINAGE
Sub-surface drainage systems will only remove water from soils in which gravity is the
primary energy gradient. Sub-surface drains may not remove all of this moisture. Darcy’s
law is applicable for the design of sub-drainage systems, but it should be emphasized
that only “free” water (the quantity sometimes referred to as the specific yield) can be
removed by a sub-surface drainage system.
7.5.1
Horizontal drains
Groundwater problems frequently involve water trapped on an impermeable layer above
the actual water table. These problems often can be solved with horizontal drains
(Fig. 7.05B). Horizontal drains are either perforated or slotted pipes wrapped with
geotextile placed in holes which have been bored into the aquifer or water bearing
formation. Usually, these are installed in cut slopes and under fills to guard against slide
and slip-outs by relieving hydrostatic pressure, though they may be used to prevent
saturation of the roadbed material. A collection system to remove the intercepted water
shall be provided.
A trench loosely backfilled with graded stones in which the space between the stones
serve as a passageway for sub-surface water. Drains of this general type are known as
“French Drains”. While “French Drains” provide a degree of crude sub-surface drainage
with naturally occurring materials, they have recently given way to the more effective pipe
under drains surrounded by geomembranes/geotextile.
7.6
PIPE UNDER DRAINS
Longitudinal pipe under drains are often used in regions of high groundwater to intercept sub-
surface water before it can reach and enter the structural materials supporting the pavement.
In sloping terrain, when slope stability is not a problem, a trench may be excavated along the
uphill side of the roadbed near the toe of the cut slope. In areas where the ground is nearly
level, longitudinal pipe under drains may be necessary along both sides of the roadbed near
the toe of cut slopes. Longitudinal pipe under drains are also placed along the toe of fills to
intercept high groundwater.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
In hilly or mountainous terrain, a transverse interceptor pipe under drain may be necessary
to prevent groundwater seepage from flowing down the grade out of cut sections and into
the fills which can cause subsidence and slip outs. Shallow transverse drains are also
constructed in conjunction with treated and untreated permeable base layers for rapid
removal of surface water infiltration.
The locations and depths of pipe under drain trenches depend largely on hydrostatic
pressures and soil permeabilities. Whenever practicable, under drain pipe should be
placed at a depth so as to be in the impervious zone below the aquifer.
Outlets for longitudinal pipe under drains shall preferably be placed at intervals of not more than
300 m.
7.7
SUBGRADE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
Natural elements constantly work to create cracks and open joints in almost all pavements.
While every effort should be made to minimize the amount of water that enters pavements,
the roadbed structural layers should be designed to accommodate occasional wetting
and still prevent water damage.
Water infiltrating through the pavement surface is the most common cause of damage to
highway pavements. Even on regularly maintained roads surfaces, infiltration of water is
at considerable rates and the rapid removal of water from the pavement section is essential.
The inclusion of a positive sub-grade drainage system is the best insurance against water-
caused distress in both flexible and rigid pavements.
The function of a subgrade drainage system is to rapidly remove water entrapped under
the pavement. The basic components of such a drainage system are:
i)
A permeable base drainage layer;
ii)
A collector and outlet system.
Typical cross-sections for sub-grade drainage system are given in Fig. 7.05C.
7.8
EDGE DRAIN COLLECTOR SYSTEMS
An adequate collector and outlet system must be used with a permeable drainage layer
under the pavement. These collector drains are typically longitudinal drains located at or
near the edge of pavement, hence they are commonly called edge drains. Some of the
various types of pavement edge drains are given in Fig. 7.05D.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The basic function of an edge drain system is the rapid removal of water entrapped beneath
the pavement. Although longitudinal pipe under drains may be, on occasion, located close
enough to the edge of pavement so that they intercept surface water infiltration, their primary
function is to prevent groundwater from reaching the roadbed.
Typically, the dimensions of an edge drain system are less than those required for a longitudinal
under drains. Since the required size of conduit and the width and depth of edge drain trench
are smaller, the cost per linear meter of edge drain is less than that for pipe under drains.
7.9
EROSION CONTROL MEASURES
Erosion controls in one form or another is required for virtually every highway construction
project. They may range from simple grass cover to elaborate channel protection measures.

======================================================================

Drainage and Erosion Protection
Function
In general, erosion controls perform one or more of the following functions:
i)
Reducing the impact of raindrops on exposed soil;
ii)
Binding the soil particles together;
iii)
Preventing uncontrolled flow down slope;
iv)
Preventing the velocity of sheet and channel flows;
v)
Protecting of soils from high flow velocities;
vi)
Protecting soil against the impact of ice flows, debris or waves.
Measures
The various categories of erosion control measures used in highway construction are
given below:
i)
Vegetative Cover;
ii)
Non-vegetative Cover - temporary;
iii)
Non-Vegetative Cover - permanent;
iv)
Slope Modification;
v)
Temporary Runoff Controls;
vi)
Retaining Walls;
vii) Control of Wind Erosion;
viii) Permanent Drainage Erosion Controls.
Only some of these are recommended for expressways as described below:
7.9.1
Vegetative cover
Vegetative methods of controlling erosion are vital to highway construction, since they are
effective in the long term, relatively inexpensive, and visually pleasing. Their main
drawbacks are that vegetation grown from seed is totally ineffective in its initial stages of
development unless supplemented by application of a mulch and vegetative cover is unable
to withstand high flow velocities.
7.9.2
Permanent non-vegetative cover
For growth of turfs, grass or vegetative cover over silty sand or fly ash type of fill materials
require a thick layer of (around 300 mm) good earth (with substantial clay content). In



======================================================================
PAGE 344 of 528
======================================================================
II - 184
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
places where “good earth” is not easily available, rubble stone, dry stone masonry, bricks,
soft-stone, slabs, blocks, lateritic stone blocks, grouted stone masonry and concrete blocks
are used. These are termed as non-vegetative covers and are permanent (requiring less
maintenance) in nature.
7.9.3
Slope modification
Slope erosion can be reduced to some extent by flattening the gradient or by reducing the
effective slope length by breaking it up into segments with benches or serrations.
This reduces the amount of runoff travelling down slope, reduces the flow velocity, increases
infiltration and intercepts some of the sediment before it reaches the toe of slope.
7.9.4
Temporary runoff control
As most sheet and small trench with erosion is caused by flowing water, it is essential that
overland flow be controlled at all stages of the project, especially before the soil cover is
applied. This may be achieved by intercepting sheet flow and safely conveying it to a
satisfactory outlet, or in some cases by storing it.
7.9.5
Temporary check dams
A check dam is a small barrier constructed in a ditch or other channel to reduce the hydraulic
gradient and flow-velocity, thereby minimizing erosion of the channel and preventing
degradation and gulling.
Temporary check dams are used to reduce channel flow velocity until grass lining has
become fully established.
It suffers from a major disadvantage that they are vulnerable to washouts caused by end
cutting, under cutting and hydrostatic pressure, and if they fail, may cause more
sedimentation down stream than it would have occurred without them.
7.10
EXISTING DRAINS, CANALS AND MINOR WATERWAYS
The expressway will pass over the existing drains, canals and waterways.  These are to be
provided with adequate crossing facility depending on their requirements.  Draining provisions
for these must be maintained and the consequences of prolonged heavy rainfall must be
allowed for.



======================================================================
PAGE 345 of 528
======================================================================
II - 185
Drainage and Erosion Protection
Particular attention should be given to the drainage channels carrying factory waste and
effluent.  Special attention is required for chloride contaminated effluents which are likely
to affect the RCC structures.
While crossing irrigation canals, sufficient care shall be taken so that the spillage from
expressway does not contaminate the flow in the canal.
When the existing channels and the expressway runs parallel, adequate precautions in
the form of bank protection and channel alignment should be taken so that there is no
stagnation or water build up against the expressway slope endangering pavement drainage.
The drainage channels at the toe of the expressway may have to be adequately protected
or reshaped for discharge into these channels.  Where discharge from road drainage is
not permitted, separate cross drainage structures are to be provided on both the sides of
such channels.

Rain Water Harvesting and Conservation Manual, Government of India,
Consultancy Services Organisation, Central Public Works Department,
Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi – 110011, and
(ii) IRC:SP:50 Guidelines on Urban Drainage.
Rain water harvesting and Conservation, is the activity of direct collection of rain water.
The conservation of rain water so collected can be stored for use or can be re-charged
into the aquifer. The main goal is to minimize flow of rain water through drains to the outfall
without making any use of the same. It is well known that the groundwater level is depleting
and getting lower and lower in the last decades.
The Artificial recharge technique should normally address the following issues:
i)
Enhance the sustainable yield in areas where over development has
depleted the aquifer.
ii)
Enhance the rainfall runoff, since this is going to sewer or storm Water drain.
iii)
Conservation and storage of excess surface water for future requirements,
since these requirements often change within a season or a period.
iv)
Surface water is inadequate to meet our demand and we have to depend
on ground water.
These issues can be addressed by adopting the following forms.
(A)
Recharge Pit
i)
Recharge pits are constructed recharging the shallow aquifer.
ii)
These are constructed generally 1 to 2 m wide and 2 to 3 m deep.
iii)
After excavation, the pits are refilled with pebbles and boulders.
iv)
Water to be recharged should be silt free as far as possible.
v)
Cleaning of the pit should preferably be done once a year.
vi)
It is suitable for small buildings having roof top area upto 100 sqm.
vii) Recharge pit may be of any shape i.e. circular, square or rectangular.

viii) The run off of 1st rain should not be allowed to percolate to the rain water
harvesting structure and it be allowed to go to the drain by making suitable
bypass arrangement in water carrying pipe systems.
ix)
If the pit is of trapezoidal shape, the side slopes should be steep enough to
avoid silt deposition.
(B)
Recharge Trench
i)
It is constructed when permeable strata of adequate thickness are available
at shallow depth.
ii)
It is a trench of shallow depth filled with pebbles and boulders.
iii)
These are constructed across the land slope.
iv)
The trench may be 0.5 to 1 m wide, 1 to 1.5 m deep and 10 to 20 m long
depending upon the availability of land and roof top area.
v)
It is suitable for the buildings having roof area of 200 to 300 sqm.
vi)
Cleaning of trench should be done periodically.
(C)
Gravity Head Recharge Well
i)
Bore wells/tube wells can be used as recharge structure.
ii)
This technique is suitable where
a) Land availability is limited
b) When aquifer is deep and over land by impermeable strata (clay)
iii)
The roof top Rain Water is channelised to the well and recharges under
gravity flow condition.
iv)
Recharge water should be silt free as far as possible.
v)
The well can also be used for pumping.
vi)
Most suitable for the areas where Ground Water levels are deep.
vii) The number of recharging structures can be determined in limited area
around the buildings depending upon roof top area and aquifer
characteristics.
viii) The run off of 1st rain should not be allowed to percolate to the rain water
harvesting structure and it be allowed it to go to the drain by making suitable
bypass arrangement in water carrying pipe systems.

Recharge Shaft
i)
A recharge shaft is dug manually or drilled by the reverse/direct rotary
method.
ii)
Diameter or recharge shaft varies from 0.5 to 3 m depending upon the
availability of water to be recharged.
iii)
It is constructed where the shallow aquifer is located below clayey surface.
iv)
Recharge shaft is back filled with boulders, gravels and coarse sand.
v)
It should end in more permeable strata (sand).
vi)
Depth of recharge shaft varies from 10 – 15 m below ground level.
vii) Recharge shaft should be constructed 10 to 15 m away from buildings for
the safety of building
viii) It should be cleaned annually preferably by scrapping the top layer of sand
and refilling it accordingly.
Any of the above system can be integrated with the roadside surface drainage. A typical
arrangement is shown in Fig. 7-A-1 Rainwater Harvesting Arrangement.

SAFETY BARRIERS
8.1
INTRODUCTION
The ideal roadway would be entirely free of any roadside obstructions or other hazardous
conditions. This is rarely practical because of natural, economic, and environmental factors.
The consistent application of geometric design standard for expressway provides motorist
with a high degree of safety. For safety reasons, technological development and adequate
regulations requires to develop new safety barriers for the expressways. This technology
of such barriers absorbs the impacts and redirects the vehicles back into carriageway.
8.2
BARRIER ACCEPTANCE STANDARDS
Mechanistic design of barrier system involving vehicle barrier impact mechanism is a
complex process. Therefore, the barrier effectiveness is evaluated from the “crash tests”
performed on representative vehicles.
To be effective a barrier must be capable of restraining a vehicle from:
i)
a) Penetrating, vaulting over or wedging under the installation;
b) Unless otherwise designed the barrier must also remain intact so that
detached elements and debris will not create hazards for vehicle
occupants or other traffic;
c) The system must be designed and installed so that spearing does not occur;
ii)
The vehicle/barrier collision should result in smooth redirection of the vehicle
at an angle so that the vehicle will not create hazard to trailing or oncoming
vehicles;
iii)
The collision must not result in excessive damage to the vehicle occupants.
“NCHRP Report 350: Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluation
of Highway Features” is accepted as standards almost universally. An abridged content
of NCHRP Report 350 is presented below:
The procedures are directed at the safety performance of roadside safety features; other
service requirements such as economics and aesthetics are not considered here.
In accordance with NCHRP Report 350, Indicative Test Levels are:

Selection criteria
Highway safety features, including longitudinal barriers, anchor assemblies, bridge
terminal assemblies and impact attenuators, installed on the Expressway must demonstrate
satisfactory crash worthy performance.
A given feature, placed on expressway, must be tested to one of six different test levels
(TL) mentioned earlier.
Once geometric and traffic control deficiencies are addressed and these do not fully
rectify the issue, then the installation of barriers should be considered. Although objective
warrants for the use of these performance barriers do not presently exist, subjective factors
most often be considered for new construction or for upgrading safety. Based on literature
survey, suggestive criteria are  stated below:
Barrier Type
Placement
TL-3
On mainline expressway as identified in warrant.
TL – 4
and
TL – 5
On stretches with significant percentage of trucks;
Where third party injury risk is high;
Likely places affecting other railway, important highway and
important utility lines and places;
Adjacent to water bodies of importance.
TL – 2
For all other places such as interchange ramps, connection to local
roads, protection of bridge piers on median and roadside etc.

Safety Barriers
8.2.2
Barrier warrants
A warrant is an empirical expression, which combines the degree of need in terms of
accident severity of a single accident with the frequency of errant vehicle accidents and
average cost. Warrants are the criteria by which the need for a safety treatment or
improvement can be determined.
Barrier warrants are based on the premise that a traffic barrier should be installed to
reduce the severity of potential accidents.
Embankments
Embankment height and side slope are the basic factors considered in determining barrier
need as shown in Fig. 8.01. These criteria are based on studies of relative severity of
encroachments on embankments versus impact with roadside barriers. Embankments
with slope and height combinations on or below the curve do not warrant shielding unless
they contain obstacles within the clear zone that presents a serious hazard to errant
motorists.
Roadside Obstacles
Roadside obstacles may be non-traversable hazards on fixed object and may be either
man made or natural. Barrier warrants for roadside obstacles are a function of the obstacle
itself and the likelihood that it will be hit.  However, a barrier should be installed only if it is
clear that the result of a vehicle striking the barrier will be less severe than the accident
resulting from hitting the un-shielding object. Non-traversable and fixed object hazards,
which normally warrant shielding are listed in Table 8.01.
Median Barriers
A median barrier should be installed only if striking the barrier is less severe than the
consequence that would result if no barrier existed. Fig. 8.02 suggests warrants for median
barriers on high speed, controlled access roadways which have relatively flat, traversable
medians.  Barriers are typically considered for combination of average daily traffic (ADT)

relatively subjective and does not specifically address the cost-effectiveness issue.

Types of safety barriers
Based on the type of protection, barriers can be classified as:
i)
Longitudinal barriers
a)
Verge side/Edge barriers
b)
Median barriers
ii)
Crash cushions
a)
For temporary installations in construction zones
b)
Precast barriers
8.2.4
Verge/edge barrier selection
The barrier performance-level requirements must be considered when selecting an
appropriate roadside barrier. Traditionally, most barriers have been developed and tested
for passenger cars and offer marginal protection when struck by heavier vehicles at high
speeds and at other than flat angles of impact. Therefore, if passenger vehicles are the
primary concern, the steel plate beam system will normally be selected. However, locations
with high traffic volumes, high speeds, high-crash experience, and/or a significant volume
of heavy trucks and buses may warrant a higher performance level barrier (e.g., the concrete
barrier). This is especially important if barrier penetration by a vehicle is likely to have
serious consequences.
The dynamic deflection must also be considered in barrier selection. Fig. 8.03
presents typical barriers with important dimensions and the dynamic deflection
values. NCHRP-350 test requirements and their probable usages have also been
described.
Another consideration in selecting the barrier type depends on maintenance of the
system. Although the steel plate beam guardrail can often sustain second hits, it will
need to be repaired with some frequency. In areas of restricted geometry, high
speeds, high traffic volumes, and/or where railing repair creates hazardous
conditions for both the repair crew and for motorists using the roadway, a rigid barrier
should be considered.

1)
Performance
Capability
Barrier must be structurally able to contain and redirect design vehicle.
2)
Deflection
Expected deflection of barrier should not exceed available room to deflect.
3)
Site Conditions
Slope approaching on the barrier, and distance from traveled way, may preclude
use of some barrier types.
4)
Compatibility
Barrier must be compatible with planned terminal treatment and capable of
transition to other carrier systems (such as bridge railing).
5)
Cost
Standard barrier systems are relatively consistent in cost, but high -performance
railings can cost significantly more.
6)
Maintenance
(a) Routine
(b) Collision
(c) Materials Storage
(d) Simplicity
Few systems require a significant amount of routine maintenance.
Generally, flexible or semi -rigid systems require significantly more maintenance
after a collision than rigid or high performance railings.
The fewer the number of different systems used, the fewer inventory
items/storage space required.
Simpler designs, in addition to costing less, are
more likely to be reconstructed
properly by field personnel.
7)
Aesthetics
Occasionally, barrier aesthetics is an important consideration in selection.
8)
Field Experience
The performance and maintenance requirements of existing systems should be
monitored to identify problems that could be lessened or eliminated by using a
different barrier type.

Safety Barriers
8.2.4.1
Cost considerations for use of concrete barrier on roadside
New Jersey Safety Side Barrier (AASHTO designation - SGM 11a & b) of height 810
mm above the adjacent pavement or F-shape (AASHTO designation - SGM 10a & b) of
height 1070 mm above the adjacent pavement are acceptable as roadside concrete
barrier. The sloped front (traffic side) face and vertical back makes it more vulnerable to
over turn. Therefore, the roadside version usually contains more reinforcing steel and/or
a more elaborating footing design unless earth support is available on the backside of
the barrier.
Moreover, the presence of continuous concrete barrier on the shoulder side will be a
hindrance for drainage of the runoff from the carriageway. This would require providing
drainage on the shoulder side using kerb and channel coupled with drainage slots/
openings as outlets on the crash barrier at 10 to 15 m intervals. This is required to be
followed by provision of chute drains over the embankment for safe passage of the runoff
from the carriageway.
Typical arrangement is shown in Fig. 8.04.
The provision of continuous concrete barrier may produce tunnel effect on the road users.
However, where it is necessary to provide Noise Barriers, the concrete crash barrier shall
provide a good foundation for the purpose.
Compared to metal beam barriers, the concrete barriers require less maintenance and
less attendance. The concrete barriers can also sustain more amounts of minor to medium
collisions, without maintenance, compared to metal beam barriers which require immediate
attention and replacement of the damaged elements. The initial costs of concrete barriers
are more than metal beam barriers. A rough cost estimate for comparative purposes is
indicated below:
•
Roadside concrete crash barrier with chutes
Rs 18,000 per meter
•
Roadside concrete crash barrier without chutes Rs. 15,000 per meter
•
Roadside Metal beam barrier (W – shape)
Rs   3,000 per meter
•
Median side concrete crash barrier
Rs   5,500 per meter
8.2.5
Median barrier selection
For expressway median (4.5 m), the centrally placed double faced concrete barriers or
double faced steel plate – W-beam type are the two alternatives. A 4.5 m wide median

Safety Barriers
sufficiently meets the dynamic deflection requirement to arrest and redirect the errant
vehicle. Compared to concrete barriers, the metal beam barriers are maintenance prone
requiring periodic attention. Such maintenance is also a safety hazard.
In spite of initial higher cost, on maintenance consideration, concrete barrier on median is
preferred in Indian context.
On wide medians, where the barriers used to be placed wide apart, the cost aspect may
require trade off for the selection of median barrier systems. These involve a subjective
evaluation of the many trade-offs between systems:
Median Width. The median width will significantly affect the probability of impact (i.e., the
number of hits) and the likely angles of impact. The former will influence maintenance
costs; the latter influences safety. The greater the offset to the barrier, the higher the likely
angle of impact. Therefore, considering both maintenance and safety, this favours the use
of the concrete barrier on narrow median widths and the steel plate double faced guardrail
system for wider medians. The concrete barrier may be used on wider median widths on
high-volume roadways where crossover crashes would be catastrophic.
Heavy Vehicle Traffic. The concrete barrier is more likely to restrain and redirect heavy
vehicles (trucks and buses) than the steel plate double faced guardrail system. Therefore,
where there is a high volume of heavy vehicles, this may favour the concrete barrier even
on medians wider than 8 m. If there has been an adverse history of heavy-vehicle cross
over crashes, the 1070 mm concrete barrier should be considered.
Costs. The initial cost of the concrete barrier will exceed, perhaps by a wide margin, the
initial cost of the steel plate double faced guardrail system median barrier. The concrete
barrier may also require a closed drainage system in the median, further increasing initial
costs. However, the maintenance costs per impact on the concrete barrier will probably
be far less, which favours the concrete barrier in narrow medians and/or on high-volume
highways.
Maintenance Operations. Two factors are important. First, maintenance response time
will influence safety. The longer a damaged section of median barrier is present, the greater
the likelihood of a second impact on a substandard barrier. This observation favours the
use of the concrete barrier which normally sustains far less damage when impacted.
Second, the maintenance operations for repairing damaged barrier can interrupt traffic
operations. It is particularly undesirable to close a traffic lane to repair a barrier. The



======================================================================
PAGE 370 of 528
======================================================================
II - 210
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
consideration of maintenance operations generally favours the use of the concrete barrier
in narrow medians and/or on high-volume highways.
Appurtenances. A roadway with a median barrier may also warrant other appurtenances
in the median (e.g., highway lighting, signs, and glare screens). Since such appurtenances
are warranted, this favours the use of the concrete barrier.
Table 8.04 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the median barriers and
provides their typical usage.
The barriers discussed above may also be used in locations other than median. This
would typically occur where a barrier is needed to separate lanes of traffic moving in the
same direction, or beginning to diverge.
Table 8.04 Median Barrier Selection
Note: Same as Table 8.02
8.3
VERGE SIDE/EDGE BARRIER: PLACEMENT AND END TREATMENTS
A verge side/edge barrier is a longitudinal barrier used to shield roadside obstacles or
non-traversable terrain features.  It may occasionally be used to protect pedestrians,
bystanders from vehicular traffic.
8.3.1
Placement considerations
The Verge side/Edge barriers shall be placed on the earthen shoulder with a minimum
clearance of 250 mm from the paved shoulder edge.
This placement/provision of longitudinal barrier shall be continuous with exceptions/
adjustment near structures or any other hazards which may be unsafe for the vehicular traffic.
8.3.2
End treatments
A crashworthy end treatment is considered essential. To be crashworthy, the end treatment
should not spear, vault, or roll a vehicle for head-on or angled impacts. For impacts within
the length of need, the end treatment should have the same re-directional characteristics
as the standard verge side/edge barrier.
For Expressways, the  barriers may be provided for the entire length. However near the



======================================================================
PAGE 371 of 528
======================================================================
II - 211
Safety Barriers
Toll plaza and at Gore areas, end treatment may be required to be provided. In addition
this may also be required to protect bridge piers, utility poles and foundation of overhead
sign boards.
An untreated end of the roadside barrier can be hazardous, because the barrier can
penetrate the passenger compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. End
treatments should therefore form an integral part of safety barriers. And end treatment
should not spear, vault or roll a vehicle for head-on or angled impacts.
For the expressway, turn down end treatment shall not be used. On the other hand the
same height is maintained parallel to carriageway or paved shoulder edge for around 10-
15 m with crash cushion at the end. The layout may also be flared for additional safety.
A typical arrangement of embankment guardrail end treatment and a typical connection
between two types of safety fences are presented in Fig. 8.05 and Fig. 8.06 respectively.
Fig. 8.07 presents a typical layout of crash cushion at Gore areas and near Toll plaza.
A typical pictorial view of crash cushions can be seen in Fig. 8.08.
8.4
MEDIAN BARRIERS: PLACEMENT AND END TREATMENTS
Median barrier can be defined as a longitudinal barrier used to prevent an errant vehicle
from crossing the highway median.
8.4.1
Placement recommendations
 All traffic barriers perform best when an impacting vehicle has all its wheels on the ground
at the time of impact, and its suspension system is neither compressed nor extended.
Thus, major factors to consider in the lateral placement of a median barrier are the effects
of the terrain between the edge of the travelled way and the barrier on the vehicle trajectory.
The lateral offset from safety barrier to the edge of the carriageway is given in “Fig.1.06
Location of Safety Barrier and Table 1.07 Width of Paved Shoulder - Chapter-1 Geometric
Design”. Other significant factors affecting barrier performance are as follows:
Terrain Effects
Terrain conditions between the carriageway and the barrier can have significant effects
on the barriers impact performance. Kerbs and sloped medians (including super-elevated
sections) are two prominent features, which deserve special attention.

Safety Barriers
Sloped Medians
The most desirable median is one that is relatively flat (slopes of 10:1 or less) and free of
rigid objects. If warranted, the barrier can then be placed at the centre of the median.
When these conditions cannot be met, placement guidelines are necessary.
Fig. 8.09 shows three basic median sections for which placement guidelines are presented.
In each section, it is assumed that a median barrier is warranted. Section I applies to
depressed medians or medians with a ditch section. Section II applies to stepped medians
or medians that separate travel ways with significant differences in elevation and Section
III applies to raised medians, or median berms.

======================================================================

Safety Barriers
Section I - The slopes and the ditch section should first be checked to determine if a
roadside barrier is warranted. If both slopes require shielding (Illustration) a roadside
barrier should be placed near the shoulder on each side of the median (“b” and “d”). If only
one slope requires shielding eg. a median barrier should be placed at “d”. In this situation,
a rigid or semi-rigid barrier is suggested and a kerb rail should be installed on the ditch
side of the barrier to prevent vehicles that have crossed the ditch from snagging on a post
and beam railing system.
If neither slope requires shielding but both are steeper than 10:1(Illustration a median
barrier should be placed on the side with the steeper slope when warranted.
For example, if:  S2 = 6:1 and S3 = 10:1
The barrier would be placed at “b”. A rigid or semi-rigid system is suggested in this
situation. If both slopes are relatively flat (Illustration 3), a median barrier may be placed at
or near the centre of the median (at “c”) if vehicle override is not likely. Any type of median
barrier can be used, provided its deflection is not greater than one half the median width.
Section II - If the embankment slope is steeper than approximately 10:1 (Illustration 4), a
median barrier should be placed at “b”. If the slope is not traversable (rough rock cut, etc.) a
roadside barrier should be placed at both “b” and “d” (Illustration 5)). It is not unusual for this
section to have a retaining wall at “d”. If so, it is suggested that the base of the wall be contoured
to the exterior shape of a concrete median barrier. If the cross slope is flatter than approximately
10:1, a barrier could be placed at or near the centre of the median (Illustration 6).
Section III - Placement criteria for median barriers on this cross-section (Illustration 7)
are not clearly defined. Research has shown that such a cross-section, if high enough and
wide enough can itself redirect vehicles impacting at relatively shallow angles.
As a general rule, if the cross-section itself is inadequate for redirecting errant vehicle, i.e.
the slopes are relatively flat, a semi-rigid median barrier should be placed at the apex of
the cross-section.
If the slopes are not traversable (rough rock cut, etc.) a roadside barrier should be placed
at “b” and “d”. If retaining walls are used at “b” and “d”, it is recommended that the base of
the wall be contoured to the exterior shape of a standard concrete barrier.



======================================================================
PAGE 376 of 528
======================================================================
II - 216
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
When a median barrier is warranted, it is desirable that the same barrier be used throughout
the length of need, and that the barrier be placed in the middle of a flat median.
8.5
BARRIERS ON BRIDGES
Concrete Barriers should be used on Bridges. IRC: 5-1998 recommends suitably designed
crash barriers shall be provided at the following situations to safeguard against errant
vehicles:
i)
Multi-lane bridges and bridges on expressways
ii)
Flyovers and interchanges in urban situations
iii)
ROBs across railway lines
iv)
Open sea, breakwaters, deep valleys/gorges
For other cases, decision may be taken by the appropriate authority duly considering the
importance of the structure and the level of safety warranted.
Crash barriers, when provided, shall be essentially of the following types:
Typical shapes and dimensional details of Crash Barriers and their locations on the bridge
decks are given in Fig. 8.10A. These crash barriers are stronger compared to
NCHRP-350 test criteria. The dimensions of these barriers meet the requirements of
AASHTO as well as high containment requirements for TL-4 and TL-5 of NCHRP-350.
End Treatment of Bridge and Tunnel
For expressways, concrete barriers have generally been considered. However, in some
places, provision of metal beam barriers may have to be adopted, as for example
protecting hazards. Sometimes, it may not be economical to adjust the longitudinal concrete
barriers.
In such circumstances, the two types of barriers need to be connected for example with concrete
barrier on bridges and tunnels as shown in Fig. 8.10B and Fig. 8.10C. At the junction points,
the flexible metal beam barrier has to be stiffened by reducing the spacing of supports and
finally the W-beam is connected with the face of the concrete barrier. This stiffness on flexible
metal beam barrier may be progressively met over a length of 10 to15 m.

OTHER BARRIERS
8.6.1
Barriers to shield hazards
General
-
Hazards on expressways may include
-
Foundations of gantry signs
-
Piers and abutments of overpass structures
-
Permanent structures
-
Utility poles or allied structures
These may have to be accommodated on the median or on verge side. Such hazards
from safety considerations need to be shielded or protected from vehicular collision.
Since on expressways, by policy decisions, continuous longitudinal safety barriers need
to be provided, minor adjustment to the layout can provide desired safety against such
hazards.
Verge Side/Edge Side Locations
The typical placement of barriers or deviations in longitudinal barriers are presented in
Fig. 8.11A. The treatments are required to be provided for traffic in one direction only.
Median Side Locations
When the hazard is on median, the protection measures have to consider traffic in both
directions. The layout becomes similar to verge side one but are extended with mirror
image on the other side. A typical location is shown in Fig. 8.11B.
Removable Barrier
These are longitudinal barriers of high impact resistance. These are useful in toll plaza
area, maintenance work zones, for temporary closures etc. These channelise the vehicles
around hazardous areas, reducing exposure to liability and worker injury.
These may be made of concrete blocks connected by metal pipes or chain links or hollow
polymer containers. These should preferably be light weight for easy manual handling.

8.6.2
Fences against falling objects
The purpose of installation of fences against falling objects is the prevention of objects
from falling from over-bridges down to expressways or the prevention of objects from
jumping beyond the vehicles on expressways to areas out of the expressways, to ensure
traffic safety.
1)
Types
Fences to prevent falling objects are grouped into the following two types according to
their purposes.
i)
Fences to prevent objects dropping from other roads over expressway.
ii)
Fences to prevent objects falling off expressways into railway, major highway
and canal: Installed along roadsides of expressways.
This fencing shall be installed vertically adjacent to the uprights of the parapets or
crash barriers, starting from the base in the case of parapets with horizontal elements
of metal, or starting from the top of the structure in the case of reinforced concrete
parapets crash barrier.  In any case the fencing should be a minimum of 2.20 m in
height, starting from the pavement surface, and shall extend along the whole length of
the overpass as per computation given in the following para. The grill shall be supported
by stiff frameworks of suitable dimensions.
2)
Places of Installation
i)
Fences to prevent objects dropping from over-bridges
a) National Highways and State Highways.
b) Over-bridges in densely populated areas used by a large number of
people and vehicles.
c) Over-bridges designated as school-commuting roads.
d) Other sections where installation of fences is deemed necessary.
ii)
Fences to prevent objects falling off expressways
a) Sections crossing or nearing railway tracks.
b) Sections crossing or nearing heavily trafficked truck roads.
c) Sections in the vicinity of housing areas.
d) Other sections where installation of fences is deemed necessary.

8.7
CRASH CUSHIONS
A crash cushion’s major contribution to highway safety is its ability to absorbs energy at a
controlled rate, thus stopping an impacting vehicle in such a way that its occupants may
avoid serious injuries. There are basically two concepts, either of which is followed, to
accomplish this task.  These are:
-
Kinetic Energy Principle
-
Conservation of Momentum Principle
8.7.1
Application of crash cushions
Fixed objects as listed in Table 8.01 require shielding when located within the designated
clear zone for expressways. Some of these objects can be shielded only with crash cushion,



======================================================================
PAGE 383 of 528
======================================================================
II - 223
Safety Barriers
but most can also be shielded with a properly designed longitudinal barrier with
crashworthy end terminals. A common application of a crash cushion is in an exit ramp
gore on an elevated or depressed structure where a bridge rail end or a pier requires
shielding. Crash cushions are also frequently used to shield the ends of median barriers.
Special condition for which crash cushions are applicable is the protection of construction
and maintenance personnel as well as motorists in work zones. Portable and temporary
crash cushions have been developed for use in such situations. These shall be installed
at Toll Plaza and Gore area.

Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
CHAPTER - 9
TRAFFIC SIGNS AND PAVEMENT MARKINGS
9.1
GENERAL
9.1.1
Introduction
To maintain value added services, signs should be used to provide guidance, warnings,
notice and regulatory information to road in well designed formats for ensuring comfortable,
safe and smooth driving. Signs are also essential where hazards are not self-evident.
These also provide information on entry/exit directions, destinations and points of interest.
Clear, ample and effective signing is at places to provide adequate reaction time for the
driver. Signs are designed so that they are legible to road users approaching them and
readable in time to permit proper responses. Desired design characteristics include:
•
Long visibility distances,
•
Large lettering and symbols, and
•
Short legends for quick comprehension
In general, the signage shall follow IRC: 67 code of practice for road signs and reference
may be made to clause 800: traffic signs, markings and other appurtenances in MORTH
– Specifications for road and bridge works.
In general, this chapter describes the Mandatory/Regulatory signs, Cautionary/ Warning
signs and Informatory/Guide signs illustrated in this chapter for use only on Expressways.
Functional usage classifications are generally defined as follows:
•
Mandatory/Regulatory (Circular) signs:
These signs are used to impose legal restrictions applicable to particular locations and
unenforceable without such signs. These include all signs, such as, Speed Limits, No
Entry, etc. which give notice of special obligations, prohibitions or restrictions for traffic
control, which the road users must comply. The violation of the rules and regulations
conveyed by these signs is a legal offence and shall attract penalty.
•
Cautionary/Warning Tringular signs:



======================================================================
PAGE 388 of 528
======================================================================
II - 228
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
These signs are used to call attention to actual or potentially hazardous conditions, so that
the users can become cautious and take the desired action. These signs also advise
drivers to exercise caution.
•
Informatory/Guide (Rectangular) signs:
These signs are used to provide directions to motorists, including route designations,
destinations, available services, points of interest, and other geographic, recreational, or
cultural sites. These also inform drivers of traffic regulations and information on the points
necessary for traffic operation.
9.1.2
Expressway signing principles and classes
As mentioned above, on Expressways (a high volume-high speed facility) the road signs
require to provide adequate information on lane driving, advance information for exit,
location of facilities for emergency need for vehicles, users and vehicles.
Therefore traffic signs on Expressways should serve distinct functions as follows:
•
Give directions to destinations, or highway routes, or to another Expressway
interchanges and toll plazas;
•
Furnish advance notice of the approach to interchanges or toll plazas;
•
Direct road users into appropriate lanes in advance of diverging or merging
movements;
•
Identify routes and directions for important destination on those routes;
•
Show distances to destinations;
•
Indicate access to general motorist services, rest, scenic, and recreational
areas; and
•
Provide other information of value to the road user such as weather,
maintenance works and occurrence of incidents.
9.1.3
Siting of signs with respect to the carriageway
It shall be ensure that any sign, signal or any other device erected for traffic control, traffic
guidance and/or traffic information shall not obscure any other traffic sign and shall not
carry any advertisement.



======================================================================
PAGE 389 of 528
======================================================================
II - 229
Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
Signs requiring decisions and choices (e.g. Guide signs) need to be located sufficiently
far in advance of the decision point to permit drivers to position the vehicle in the appropriate
lane or take other preparatory action. Signs shall be mounted on gantries, cantilevers,
and butterfly or on over bridges with vertical clearances as applicable for vehicular
operations.
Considering the Expressway configuration with 3.0 m wide paved shoulder, the sign
supports need to be provided on the earthen shoulder. From the drivers’ visibility
considerations, the information which is applicable for all traffic lanes, general informations,
lane distribution information shall generally be placed on overhead gantry or on over bridges
(if available at the desired site). The exit or entry signs may be placed on cantilever.
Placement of foundation and supporting structures shall be sufficiently away from paved
shoulder edge on verge side maintaining stipulated vertical clearance for vehicle
movements.
Overhead gantry and cantilever supports within the clear zone on expressways shall always
be shielded by a safety barrier system.
Overhead guide signs may be, where practicable, mounted on overpass structures above
the expressway to minimise the number of potentially hazardous roadside structures.
Special designs for the signboard and/or its mounting may be required where an overpass
structure is skewed in plan to the line of the Expressway.
For Cantilever mounted signs, the centre of the sign is typically located over the carriageway
edge line; however the left edge of the sign shall be positioned no further left than the left
edge of paved shoulder. On exit ramps, guide signs shall be located over the relevant
lanes. Where number of signs are erected on a gantry, the outer edges of signs shall not
extend beyond the outer edges of paved shoulders.
The desirable minimum distance over which signs should be seen is the legibility distance
of the principal legend size, plus an additional one third of this distance to allow sufficient
time for the driver to see the sign prior to reading its text.
 9.1.4
Mounting height and clearance
All signs for through traffic shall be provided by overhead gantry / cantilever gantry.  Kerb
mounted signs supported on GI pipes shall be used at entry / exit of the Expressway or in
wayside amenity / toll plaza areas.  Overhead signs shall be placed on a structurally sound



======================================================================
PAGE 390 of 528
======================================================================
II - 230
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
gantry or cantilever structure made of GI pipes.  Its height, lateral clearance and installation
shall be as per this “Guidelines for Expressways”.
Overhead Gantry
Shall be mounted at 5.5 m height above the highest point on the carriageway keeping
0.5 m additional clearance and shall be extended over the entire carriageway width of
Expressway plus paved shoulder width.
Cantilever Gantry
Shall be mounted at a height of 5.5 m measured from the carriageway of the sign to the
verge side of the paved shoulder.
Fig. 9.01A and Fig. 9.01B presents typical sign which may be placed on side mounted or
overhead gantry structures. Overhead signage on gantry is preferable on the 2x3
expressways.
9.1.5
Visibility of signs
In order to make the signs more visible at night, in particular danger/warning signs and
regulatory signs on expressway shall be provided with reflective materials. Care shall be
taken that this does not result in road users becoming dazzled. The material shall be of
high intensity micro prismatic grade sheeting conforming to MORTH Specifications.
9.2
EXPRESSWAY TERMINALS AND INTERCHANGES: SIGN AND LANE
MARKINGLAYOUTS
This section illustrates typical signing and marking treatments for expressways and
interchanges.
9.2.1
Interchange exit numbering
Interchange exit numbering provides valuable orientation for the road user on an
Expressway. The feasibility of numbering interchanges or exits on an expressway will
depend largely on the extent to which grade separations are provided. Where there is
appreciable continuity of interchange facilities, interrupted only by an occasional
intersection at grade, the numbering will be helpful to Expressway user.
Interchange numbering shall be used in signing each expressway exit. Interchange exit
numbers shall be displayed with each advance Guide sign, Exit direction sign and Gore

sign. The exit number shall be displayed on a separate plaque at the top of the advance
Guide or Exit direction sign.
There are two approaches to interchange exit numbering: (1) Reference location sign
numbering (km-base) or (2) Consecutive numbering
•
km – basis is recommended in Indian situation since it is flexible for future
additional interchanges.
•
The start point (0 km) of the numbering shall be the start of the BOT project.
Each BOT project shall be identified such as I, II, III  etc. along the national
Expressway (such as NE-9)
•
It would be optional for the BOT concessionaire whether naming the
Interchange or not.

Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
9.2.2
Interchange guide signs
The signs at interchanges and on their approaches shall include advance guide sign, Exit
direction sign and Exit gore sign. Consistent destination messages shall be displayed on
these signs.
9.2.2.1
Advance guide signs
The Advance Guide sign gives notice well in advance of the exit point of the principal
destinations served by the next interchange and the distance to that interchange. Advance
Guide signs should be placed at 500m, 1 km and at 2 km in advance of the exit . Fractions
of kilometers or decimals of kilometers should not be used. Where Advance Guide signs
are provided for a right exit, diagram signs should be used.
Fig. 9.03 Shows typical Interchange advance guide sign.
9.2.2.2
Exit direction signs
The exit direction sign repeats the route and destination information that was shown on
the advance guide signs for the next exit, and thereby assures road users of the destination
served and indicates whether they exit to the right or the left for that destination.
The message EXIT ONLY in black on a yellow panel shall be used on the overhead exit
direction sign to advise road users of a lane drop situation.
Fig. 9.04 Shows typical Exit direction sign.
9.2.2.3
Exit gore signs
The Exit Gore sign in the gore indicates the exiting point or the place of departure from the
main roadway. Consistent application of this sign at each exit is important.
The gore shall be defined as the area located between the main roadway and the ramp
just beyond where the ramp branches from the main expressway.
Fig. 9.05 Shows typical Exit Gore sign.

Next exit supplemental signs
Where the distance to the next interchange is unusually long, Next Exit supplemental signs
may be installed to inform road users of the next interchange. The Next Exit supplemental
sign shall carry the legend NEXT EXIT X km. If the Next Exit supplemental sign is used, it
shall be placed below the advance guide sign nearest the interchange.

9.2.4
Expressway symbol sign
Two, three wheelers shall be banned for expressway. One identical sign for expressway
should be useful such as Germany or UK in order to avoid listing too many “not allowed
vehicles”. Fig. 9.07 shows expressway symbol sign.

9.2.5
End of expressway
The minimum treatment for advance direction signing and conditions may warrant cantilever
or overhead signing. In the case where an interchange is located near the start or end of
expressway,   the roads leading to expressway are treated with expressway type advance
exit signs. The advance exit signs are placed on the non-expressway section of the route.
Fig. 9.08.
Fig. 9.08 End of Expressway
9.2.6
Characteristics of rural signing
The tendency to group all signing in the immediate vicinity of rural interchanges should be
avoided by considering the entire route in the development of sign plans. Extra effort should
be given to the placement of signs at natural tangent locations to command the attention of
the road user, particularly when the message requires an action by the road user.
9.2.7
Post-Interchange signs
If space between interchanges permits, as in rural areas, and where undue repetition of
messages will not occur, a fixed sequence of signs should be displayed beginning 150 m
beyond the end of the acceleration lane. At this point a Route sign assembly should be
installed followed by a Distance sign as indicated in Fig. 9.09, at a spacing of 300 m. If
space between interchanges does not permit placement of these three post-interchange
signs without encroaching on or overlapping the Advance Guide signs necessary for the
next interchange, or in rural areas where the interchanging traffic is primarily local, one or
more of the post-interchange signs should be omitted.

9.2.8
Distance sign
The post-interchange Distance sign shall consist of a two- or three-line sign carrying the
names of significant destination points and the distances to those points. The top line of
the sign shall identify the next interchange with the name of the community near or through
which the route passes and exit number, or if there is no community, the route number or
name of the intersected highway.
Second line is second next exit. The third, or bottom line, shall contain the name and distance
to a control city (if any) that has national significance for travelers using the route.  When
Interchange spacing is more than 10 km, the distance sign shall be provided in between at
appropriate location.  The distances displayed on these signs should be the actual distance
to the destination points and not to the exit from the expressway or expressway.
Fig. 9.09 shows typical distance sign.
9.2.9
Signing by class of interchange
Full signing of the interchange should also cover all approaches and ramp. For Expressway
there are two classes of interchange configurations i) System Interchange and ii) Service
Interchange.
-
System Interchange may be Cloverleaf or T-type
-
Service Interchange may be Diamond or Trumpet type
Fig. 9.10 and 9.11 presents significant features of signing plan for Trumpet and Diamond
Interchanges.

9.2.13
Wrong-way traffic control at interchange ramps
At interchange exit ramp terminals where the ramp intersects a cross road in such a manner
that wrong way entry could inadvertently be made, the following signs shall be used.
On interchange entrance ramps where the ramp merges with the through roadways and
the design of the interchange does not clearly make evident the direction of traffic on the
separate roadways or ramps, a ONE WAY sign visible to traffic on the entrance ramp and
through roadway should be placed on each side of the through roadway near the entrance
ramp merging point as illustrated in Fig. 9.16.
9.2.14
Keep adequate headways
Keep adequate headway distance is a safety signage for the drivers to maintain safe
manoeuvering stopping distance. These are generally placed between interchanges and
at around 5 km interval on long stretches
Fig.  9.17 shows typical keep adequate headway sign.
9.2.15
Miscellaneous guide signs
Miscellaneous Guide signs are used to point out geographical features, such as rivers
and summits, and other jurisdictional boundaries. Miscellaneous Guide signs may be
used if they do not interfere with signing for interchanges or other critical points.
9.3
REST AREA AND GENERAL SERVICE SIGN
To provide the motorist with information on the location of succeeding rest areas, a sign
with the word message NEXT REST AREA XX km may be installed independently or as
a supplemental panel mounted below one of the advance rest area guide signs. Rest
area signs shall be provided at 2 km, 1 km and 500 m ahead of rest area.
When symbols are used for the road user services, they should be displayed as follows:

placing the substitution in the lower left (four or six services) or extreme left (three services)
portion of the sign panel. An action message or an interchange number may be used for
symbol signs in the same manner as they are used for word message signs.
If more than three services become available at rural interchange areas where limited road
user services were anticipated, replaced with an independently mounted general service sign.
A separate Telephone service sign may be installed if telephone facilities are located
adjacent to the route at places where public telephones would not normally be expected.
Chemical toilet sign may be used as needed to indicate the availability of facilities designed
for dumping wastes from recreational vehicle holding tanks.
A TRUCK PARKING sign may be used on a separate sign panel below the other general
road user services to direct truck drivers to designated parking areas.
Fig.  9.18 show typical rest area signs for six services.

TOLL PLAZA
Installed at the entrance of a toll gate, this board displays traffic and weather information
over broad areas.
For toll plaza(s), advance direction signs shall be provided at 1 km and 500 m ahead of
toll plaza. These signs are rectangular in shape, bilingual, gantry, cantilever mounted as
illustrated in Chapter-10 on Toll Plaza Design.
At the start of flare of the toll plaza, a sign displaying the fee rates shall be erected.

ROUTE MARKERS
Route markers on expressways are normally incorporated as shields or other distinctive
shapes in large directional guide signs.
Trail blazers erected at strategic locations, usually along major urban road, to indicate the
direction to the nearest or most convenient point of access.  The use of the word to indicates
that the road where marker to posted is not part of the indicated route, and that a driver is
merely being directed progressively to the route.
A trail blazer assembly shall consist of two markers, a cardinal direction marker if needed
symbol and a single headed directional arrow pointed along the route leading to the facility.
Trail blazer assemblies may be erected with or without other route marker assemblies, in
the immediate vicinity of designated facilities.

Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings
Route markers and auxiliary markers showing junctions and turns should be used for
guidance on approach roads, for route confirmation just beyond entrances and exits, and
for reassurance along the expressway. When used along the expressway, the markers
should be suitably enlarged 10-20 percent more than for main roads.
IRC: 67-2010 provides guidelines on route marker for Expressways. This guideline shall
be followed for expressway. Important points are as mentioned below:
i)
The sign may be either enamelled or painted steel plate
ii)
An expressway route marker sign shall consist of a shield painted on a
rectangular plate 600 mm x 900 mm;
iii)
The sign background and the lettering and border shall conform to
“IRC: 67”;
iv)
For letter, legend and numeral shall be NE;
v)
Word messages shall be NE(X). Where (x) is Number of National Highways
Typical route marker sign is shown in Fig. 9.19.
9.6
DISTANCE MARKER (Kilometer and 100 m Marking)
These markers will be required for the expressway drivers to identify his location enroute
as well as to assess the distances to his destinations, service areas, location of emergency
incidents etc. These also help the operation and maintenance persons to locate the places
of incidents and/or pavement distress and maintenance requirements.
The distance numberings shall desirably be continuous. A typical arrangement as practiced
in Japan showing kilometer and 100m marking is shown in Fig. 9.20. These may be
placed/ attached/embedded in crash barriers or on individual foundations.
9.7
REGULATORY (MANDATORY) SIGNS
These signs inform road users of roads closed, parking prohibition, the speed limit and
other prohibitions, regulations and special duties to be observed by users.
Table 9.01 gives the specified mandatory signs for use on expressways.

stop is necessary, it should be made on the shoulder, well off the pavement. Except
where adequate paved turnouts are provided, the road shoulders should be reserved
for emergency use by vehicles that must leave the roadway to stop because of
mechanical breakdown, tyre trouble, lack of fuel, or other emergencies involving
their occupants.
These signs are not generally used on expressway but Emergency Parking signs
should be used on expressways a short distance beyond on interchange entrance
at random intervals as needed. If necessary the word stopping may be replaced
by parking.

9.8.1
Turn and curve sign
Both signs are used where engineering investigations of roadway, geometric and operating
conditions show that recommended speed on the curve to be greater than 48 kmph and
equal to or less than the speed limit established by law or by regulation for that section of
the highway.
These signs are generally avoided as far as possible because of reduction of speed but
turn sign may be provided at interchange or ramp. This sign is necessary to warn motorist of
the existence of sharp change of alignment such as at a turn or sharp curve to avoid accident.
9.8.2
Large arrow sign
A Large Arrow sign may be used to delineate a change in horizontal alignment. The Large
Arrow sign (Fig. 9.22) shall be a horizontal rectangle with an arrow pointing to the left or right.
If used, the Large Arrow sign shall be installed on the outside of a turn or curve in line with and
at approximately a right angle to approaching traffic. The Large Arrow sign shall not be used
where there is no alignment change in the direction of travel, such as at the beginnings and
ends of medians or at center piers. The Large Arrow sign should be visible for a sufficient
distance to provide the road user with adequate time to react to the change in alignment.

Chevron alignment signs
This sign may be used as an alternative or supplement to standard delineators and to the
large arrow sign as in Fig. 9.23. This is intended to be used to give notice of a sharp
change of alignment with the direction of travel.  This sign is intended to provide additional
emphasis and guidance for vehicle operator as to changes in horizontal alignment at
roadway.
Chevron Alignment signs shall be installed on the outside of a turn or curve, in line with and
at approximately a right angle to approaching traffic. A Chevron Alignment sign may be
used on the far side of an intersection to inform drivers of a change of horizontal alignment
for through traffic. Spacing of Chevron Alignment signs should be such that the road user
always has at least two in view, until the change in alignment eliminates the need for the
signs. It should be visible for at least 150 m.  Final position may be determined by trial
runs by day and night. This sign is used on interchange ramp and sharp curve on main
carriageway

Merge sign
The merge sign is placed in advance of a point where two roadways (expressway and
other road) converge and where traffic from these roadways is moving in the same direction
of travel and must merge into one lane as given in Fig. 9.24.
The sign should be erected on the side of the encountered and in such entering roadway.
Where two roadways are of equal importance, a sign should be placed on each roadway.
9.8.5
Hill sign
The hill sign is used in advance of a downgrade/upgrade where the length, percent of
grade, horizontal curvature or other physical features requires special precautions on the
part of drivers.  When the percent grade is shown within the hill sign, the message
X percent shall be placed below the inclined ramp/vehicle symbol, Fig. 9.25.

Calculated safe wet speed is considered to be at least 10 percent lower than the
posted maximum speed.  This sign should be installed in advance of the beginning
of the slippery section and at appropriate intervals on long section of such
pavement.
The Slippery When Wet sign (Fig. 9.26) may be used to warn that a slippery condition
might exist.  When used, a Slippery When Wet sign should be placed in advance of the
beginning of the affected section and additional signs should be placed at appropriate
intervals along the road where the condition exists.
9.8.7
Warning for animal crossing
The sign should be erected where there is danger due to farm animals or cattle crossing
on the road. The sign should not be used simply because animals are driven along or
across the road at frequent intervals. If an unexpected hazard is seasonal or temporary,
these signs shall be removed when the hazardous condition terminates, Fig. 9.27.

DESIGN
9.9.1
Legend size, letter series, legend limits and sign size
a)
General
The basic requirement shall meet IRC: 67-2010 code of practice for road signs and
IRC: 30-1968 standard letters and numerals of different heights for use on expressway signs
Expressways require a higher standard of signing than other roads. This means large signs
with clear layouts and large letter sizes, as well as the repetition of important information.
The larger legends used on expressway signs result in larger total sign sizes which makes
them more conspicuous and helps drivers identify signs in the first place. The ease of
reading signs (their legibility) is affected by:

Colour: Blue background with white letters to be adopted.

Letter height: The larger the lettering, the greater the distance over which
the text is legible.

Letter series: Standard highway sign alphabets given in IRC: 67 and
IRC: 30, the wider the letter series, the easier it is to read.

Spacing of legend: It is important that adequate spacing between letters,
spacing between words and spacing between words and the edge of signs
is provided. Drivers’ eyes search for recognisable words and messages.
This is difficult to do if inadequate spacing leads to letters merging into
each other or words merging into other words or the sign’s border.

Amount of legend: There is a limit to how much can be read from a sign
within the legibility distance. The amount of information presented to the
driver therefore should be minimised. Also, many sign types which can vary
in the amount of legend (e.g. reassurance of direction signs) have limits on
the number of lines of text permitted. Similarly, signs with large amounts of
text or which require different responses, need to be separated by distance
along a road if these are to be read and acted upon appropriately.

Spacing of signs: The spacing between signs is also a critical factor in
managing the release of information to drivers. Drivers on expressways
require larger spacing than on arterial roads.



======================================================================
PAGE 421 of 528
======================================================================
II - 261
Traffic Signs and Pavement Markings

Consistency: The information presented on signs should be in a consistent
location and form so that drivers seeking specific information on signs know
where to look and what to look for, e.g. Route numbers should be located in
a prominent and standard location on the sign face.

Effective diagrams: The solution to excessive amounts of text may be to put
the information in diagrammatic form. All graphic symbols on road signs
need to be tested in accordance with IRC:67 and IRC:30.
b)
Sign Size
As outlined above, the size of a sign face is determined by the amount of legend, the letter
size, the legend series and spacing. These factors enable the sign firstly to be noticed,
and then read.
If overhead signs are warranted, the number of signs at these locations should be limited to
only those essential in communicating pertinent destination information to the road user.
Exit direction signs for a single exit and the advance guide signs should have only one panel
with one or two destinations. Regulatory signs, such as speed limits, should not be used in
conjunction with overhead guide sign installations. Because road users have limited time to
read and comprehend sign messages, there should not be more than three guide signs
displayed at any one location either on the overhead structure or its support.
At overhead locations, more than one sign may be installed to provide advice of a multiple
exit condition at an interchange. If the roadway ramp or crossing roadway has complex or
unusual geometrics, additional signs with conforming messages may be provided to
properly guide the road user.
In some cases it may be desired that signs erected on overhead structures are designed
to fit in the depth of structure for aesthetic reasons. However, sign size must not be reduced
in a way which results in reduction in letter heights, letter series or spacing.
Letter size of regulatory and mandatory signs should be enlarged suitably as per requirement.
For these two types’ signs, minimum letter size 20 cm as per IRC: 67-2010 is applicable for
expressways. For this purpose IRC:30-1968 “Standard Letters and numeral of different
heights for use on highway signs” shall be useful guideline.
For the benefit of the drivers who are not conversant with English language, important
sign may carry the message in the regional language/Hindi besides English.  Height of



======================================================================

======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
every regional/Hindi letter may be kept same.  Letter of Hindi and other regional languages
may not be keeping same height because of different script.
9.9.2
Establishment
Overhead Sign Installations:
Overhead sign installations will have value at many locations on expressways.
Over crossing structures can often serve for the support of overhead signs, and may be
the only practical location that will provide adequate viewing distance. Use of these
structures as sign supports will eliminate the need for sign supports along the roadside.
Where overhead crossings are closely spaced, it is desirable to place signs on the bridges
to enhance safety and economy. Butterfly-type signs, and other overhead sign supports
shall not be erected in gores or other exposed locations in new signing projects.
9.9.3
Material
The traffic sign plate may be made of stove-enamelled metal plate, or other suitable local
materials. Nothing should be interpreted to exclude any new material that meets the standard
requirements for colour and visibility.
9.9.4
Variable Message Signs
This has been dealt with in detail under Operation and Maintenance Section.
9.10
PAVEMENT MARKINGS AND RAISED PAVEMENT MARKERS
Pavement markings may be defined as markings on the surface of the road for the control,
warning, guidance or information of road users.
The principles to be borne in mind are:
i)
Markings must be visible under all circumstances and they must have a
good contrast with the road surface;
ii)
Markings must be durable;
iii)
Markings must not be so thick that these become a hazard in themselves.
Pavement markings on the expressway shall be in accordance with IRC:35.  These
markings shall be applied to road centre line, edge line, continuity line, stop line, give way



======================================================================

lines, diagonal/chevron markings, zebra crossing and at parking areas using a self
propelled machine with satisfactory cut off value capable of applying broken line
automatically.
9.10.1
Visibility of pavement markings
Pavement markings must be clearly visible in all conditions at day and night, wet and dry
conditions. The colour should be clear and bright, have a matt finish and contrast well with
the road surface on which the markings are laid.
Reflectorization is a very valuable aid to night time visibility. This depends for its action on
the refraction (or bending) of light entering glass at an angle.
9.10.2
Classes of markings
Pavement markings shall be classified as:
i)
Longitudinal line: Lane lines and edge markings oblique connecting and
channel lines;
ii)
Other line road markings: Chevron markings, lettering, directional arrows
etc.
i)
Longitudinal Lines
Longitudinal lines are further classified as:
a)
 Lane lines;
b)
Carriageway edge markings;
c)
 Oblique connecting and channeling lanes.
These may be continuous or broken lines.
Minimum width of longitudinal marking is 20 cm and the following colours should be
considered:
a)
White colour shall be used for carriageway markings except the ones
indicating parking restrictions; for the latter the colour used shall be yellow
conforming to IS colour No.356 as given in IS 164-1951;



======================================================================
PAGE 424 of 528
======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
b)
White together with black colour shall be used for kerb and object markings;
c)
Yellow colour may also be used for the continuous centre and barrier line
markings.
ii)
Other Road Markings
a)
Directional Arrows and Lettering
Lane selection arrows on pavement may be used for purpose of guiding, warning or
regulating traffic to change correct lane for driving.
It shall be white colour. Large numerals and letters should be used,
Fig. 9.15 shows typical directional arrows and lettering.
b)
Chevron Markings
A series of parallel chevron markings on a pavement zone, surrounded by continuous line,
is indicating closed to traffic.
On deceleration and acceleration lanes and ramps, delineators shall be provided for both
median side and shoulder where no lighting facilities. These should be used in the area of
lane reduction. For detail information on Delineators, refer Section 13.5.3.
Length and Gap
The length and gap ratios used for centre line markings often vary according to the type,
location, forward visibility and design speed of the road.
Length and gap shall be 1.5 m and 4.5 m on straight reaches and 1.5 m and 1.5m on
curve to avoid accident and better visibility of the drivers for markings.
9.11
COLOUR AND MATERIAL
The following recommendations are to be considered:
i)
Carriageway edge lines are in reflectorised hot spray thermoplastic
supplemented by  stick-on reflective markers;
ii)
Lane lines are in unreflectorised hot spray thermoplastic supplemented by
reflectors;

Toll Plaza Design
CHAPTER – 10
TOLL PLAZA DESIGN
10.1
INTRODUCTION
Some of the primary goals of tolling are to provide value added service, expedite the
maintenance process, and generate revenue. To maintain toll rates at reasonable levels
and provide a high standard of service, a toll system must be efficient for enabling the
vehicles to pass through toll plazas with least hazards of toll payment.
Toll plaza configurations are a function of the type of toll collection method, the type and
volume of traffic served by the plaza, toll rate schedules and the physical and environmental
constraints of the site.
For inter-city network, a closed ticketing system has been generally adopted. Toll Plazas
are located on the Main lane, at the beginning and end of the project and at interchange
ramps in between. The users get the ticket at the entry and pay the toll at the exit according
to the distance traveled.
Signage and lane markings are important aspects of toll plaza design as well.  They are the
primary means of conveying information and instructions to drivers. It is important that signage
and lane markings are clear and easy to understand in order to avoid confusion at toll plazas,
such as inadvertent mix-ups between manual and electronic toll collection lanes.
The use of electronic toll collection (ETC) is becoming a more preferred and accepted
method of collecting tolls at main lane and interchange toll plazas. ETC is a system that
automatically recognizes a vehicle using a valid encoded data tag, called a transponder,
and allows the vehicle admittance through the toll plaza without stopping, which, in turn,
decreases the congestion at toll plazas. The ETC lanes are usually split from cash and
smart card transaction lanes because of the difference in travel speeds, and the users of
the ETC lanes expect to receive more efficient services.
10.2
TOLL SYSTEM
For intercity expressway network, “Closed system with ticketing payment mode” shall be
adopted.  Ticketing System of tolling means that payment need to be made only at the exit
by depositing the ticket collected at the entry.
Trumpet type interchange shall be provided to connect the Expressway with the Toll Plaza
and road beyond.



======================================================================
PAGE 430 of 528
======================================================================
II - 270
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
Various Toll Collection Systems are:
10.2.1
Closed ticket system
A closed-ticket toll system has an entrance and exit booth for the toll system and captures
all users and revenue of the system. Toll plazas are located at every interchange preventing
diversion around main lane toll plazas.  Upon entering the toll system, the user receives a
ticket.  When exiting, the user gives the ticket to the toll collector and is charged a set fee
as per policy decision and notification.  Rates on this type of toll system are variable,
depending on how long a user has been traveling on the toll facility.
Some instances where usage of a closed-barrier toll system provides benefits include
the following:
•
To capture toll from all facility users;
•
To capture the entire revenue stream;
•
To provide better enforcement for toll collection; and
•
To ensure users pay tolls that are directly related to the distance traveled on
the system.
10.2.2
Closed – cash system
A closed-cash system is similar, except that a cash toll is typically paid upon entering and/
or exiting and at strategically placed main lane toll plazas throughout the toll system.  This
toll assessed to users is also based on vehicle classification and distance traveled on the
toll system. This system is suitable for intra – city / urban expressway.
10.2.3
Open system
An Open toll system is where users pay a fixed toll at set main lane toll plaza locations, but
ramp plazas are not located at each point of entry and exit from the toll system.  It is important
to note that this type of system does not account for how long a user has been traveling on the
expressway and does not capture all users and revenue on the expressway. Some instances
where usage of an open-barrier toll system provides benefits include the following:
•
To retrofit an existing transportation corridor with tolls;
•
To capture the longer distance users, including national and regional traffic,
but allow the opportunity for local traffic to be toll-free, such as on the fringes
of urban areas; and

•
To minimize implementation, operating and toll collection labour costs for
the toll system.
Fig. 10.01 presents the Closed and Open Toll Collection System.
10.3
PAYMENT TYPE
a)
Semi Automatic Toll Collection
The semi automatic toll collection system shall be equipped in each entry lane
with a vehicle detector for counting the number of vehicles and their axle number
and for identification of the category of vehicle.  The system shall also have a
ticket issuing machine for issue of the tickets for user fee at the press of a button
on a touch panel and entry lane controller for controlling the equipment of the entry
lane and for sending the data to the data processing equipment at toll plaza office.
Each toll lane shall have electronically operated boom barrier along with
synchronized system for traffic lights.
b)

Toll Plaza Design
A smart card is a plastic card, usually about the same size as a magnetic stripe card that
has electronic logic to store data and in some case a microprocessor that can process
data.
Smart card users have to stop on the “Touch & Go” reader in order to go through the
Toll Plaza.
The physical components of a smart card system are:
i)
a card;
ii)
a reader device (or a target for contactless cards);
iii)
a terminal;
iv)
a host computer; and
v)
the connections which link the components of the system
c)
Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)
The Electronic Toll Collection system shall consist of an On Board Unit (OBU) fitted on a
vehicle and an antenna to receive communication for identification of its code and other
stored data and a system for transmitting the data from the on board unit to the reader and
from reader to the customer information management system.
10.4
TOLL PLAZA ELEMENTS
All toll plaza essential elements are broadly classified as.
•
Toll collection sites – either attended toll booths or toll collection equipment
such as cash, smart card and ETC facility.
•
Toll islands – an elevated platform, typically made of concrete, which
provides crash protection devices on the traffic approach side of the toll
plaza for toll booths and violation cameras and other equipment.
•
Toll canopy – shall be wide enough to provide weather protection to toll
operators, drivers, and facilities. The canopy shall be of aesthetically
pleasing design with cylindrical support columns located at traffic island so
that there is no restriction on the visibility and traffic movement.  The canopy
may also provide mounting for signage and ETC equipment, utility access
to the toll booths and ETC lanes.

10.4.1
Lane width at toll booth
The width of each toll lane shall be 3.2 m, except for the ETC lanes (which shall be 3.5 m)
and the lane for over dimensioned vehicles (which shall be 4.5 m).
Between each toll lane of the toll plaza, traffic islands are required to accommodate toll
booth. These islands shall be of minimum 25 m length and 1.8 m width. Protective barriers
of reinforced concrete shall be placed at the front of each island to prevent out of control
approaching vehicles crashing into the toll booth. These would be painted with reflective
chevron markings.
10.4.2
Transition zone
Number of lanes at toll plaza location is generally double or more of the through
lane.  At the entry to select the appropriate toll lanes, the driver has to perform a
complex manoeuvre of deceleration and weaving for divergence. While at the exit,
the combined manoeuvre of acceleration and weaving for merging is required to be
performed.

All these operations will take place in the transition zone.  However, the complexity of
those operations will vary depending upon the toll plaza location i.e. on the expressway or
on the interchange ramp.  Accordingly the length of transition will depend on the acceptable
rate of taper. Keeping all these in mind, the following taper rates are recommended for
both acceleration and deceleration lane.

Toll Plaza Design
For the movement between toll office and toll booth of each toll lane, an underground
tunnel across all toll lanes shall be provided. Its dimension would be sufficient to
accommodate the required wiring/cable system and for convenient movement of
personnel. It should also be provided with lighting and ventilation system so that the
movement is convenient. This has been further discussed under management and
operations facilities.
10.4.8
Barrier gate
To prevent passing out of any vehicle without payment of toll, normally swing barriers are
generally placed at the exit of each lane. These barriers will normally remain closed and
on payment of toll by the passing vehicle, the barrier will be opened by the collectors
through their key board command.  Normally these can be operated by the master booth
operator and in his absence, master booth can be operated with the instruction of
supervisor.  Also there will be a provision for keeping swing barrier open if necessary.
Generally, electrically operated barrier gate is used. For ETC, the barrier gate opens
automatically controlled by ETC system.
10.4.9
Toll plaza lane length
Toll plaza length consists of two components:
i)
Straight length: This length is required to accommodate toll lane and the space
for waiting vehicles. A 100 m length would be desirable for the purpose.
ii)
Taper length: This facilitates the merging and diverging manoeuvres required
by the vehicles. Varying taper length is to be provided at both ends.
10.4.10
Utility tunnel/overbridge
For the movement between toll office and toll booth of each toll lane, an underground
tunnel / overbridge across all toll lanes shall be provided.  Its dimension would be sufficient
to accommodate the required wiring/cable system and for convenient movement of
personnel.  It should also be provided with lighting and ventilation system so that the
movement is convenient.

Table 10.01 Lane Capacity (Number of Vehicles) Service Time and Queuing Permitted
Determination of number of lanes in a toll plaza is a complex process which can be dealt
using the above table as in Japan.  The required number of lanes at a toll gate is calculated
by the access traffic volume at the interchange, the time required for collection at the toll
gate (average service time) and the number of vehicles waiting to pay (service standard).
With close ticketing system, a service time of 6 seconds at the entry and 14 seconds at
the exit may be considered. A queuing number of vehicles may be up to 3 (three).
However at each toll plaza, an investigation should be made of the directional distribution
of flow throughout all hours of day and night.  Where unbalanced flow is observed or
projected to occur, reversible toll lanes may be warranted.  As a general guide – minimum
two toll lanes in each direction of travel shall be provided with the system of payment
through smart card and their configuration would be such that one lane in each direction
could be upgraded in future to the system of Electronic Toll Collection (ETC).  Not less
than 2 middle toll lanes shall be capable of being used as reversible lane to meet the
demand of tidal flow.

ETC (ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION) SYSTEM
10.6.1
General
ETC is a modern high efficiency toll collection system placed at entry of a toll lane. The
10.5.2
Japanese method of deciding lane capacity (number of vehicles) number of toll
lane based on service time desired and queuing on lane permitted as presented in
Table 10.01:

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
vehicle can pass at reduced speed (i.e. non-stop) thus minimizing toll lane congestion.
The road side wireless system (Antenna) communicates with the On-Board-Unit (OBU)
i.e. Transponder placed on the passing vehicle.
ETC – Antenna
This antenna is conveniently installed in the ETC lane of toll gate. This instantaneously
obtains requisite travel information from OBU (transponder), computes the required
payment needed and debit the system for the toll amount.
OBU – Transponder
This transponder is installed in the bottom corner of the vehicle wind screen or behind the
rear view mirror. A two piece combination of OBU and smart Integrated Chips (IC) card is
sometimes adopted to establish a common link with the cards used for motors, buses
and other public transport facilities, as well as parking charges or similar other utility
charges.

Available technologies
Characteristics of Available Technologies
All present automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technologies operate by (1) intercepting
modulated electromagnetic radiation from a vehicle, (2) recovering the information
contained in the signal, and (3) using a computer to identify the Tag from a database.
Technologies may be divided according to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation,
the method by which the signal is modulated (tuned or adjusted), and whether the vehicle
Tag generates or simply reflects electromagnetic radiation. There are three frequency
ranges in use:(1) very low frequencies (below 200 KHz), which are employed in inductively
coupled systems; (2) microwave frequencies (500 to 8,000 MHz); and (3) optical or near-
optical frequencies (30 GHz to 1,000 GHz), which include infrared.
This radio wave communication is known as Dedicated Short Range Communication
System (DSRC) and broadly classified as:
a)
Active RF DSRC
b)
Passive RF DSRC and
c)
Infrared Ray (IR) Radiation
Comparison of Active DSRC with others are presented in Fig. 10.08 and Tables 10.02
and 10.03.   Active DSRC is suitable for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) expandability

Lane Operation
1)
The passing mode of vehicles is “non-stop”.
2)
Basically it is “exclusive”, limiting the passage of vehicles only to ETC
vehicles. “Mixed” lane operation that allows non-ETC vehicles to pass the
lane is taken into consideration separately.
3)
The System is basically operated for 24-hour, 365 days basis.
4)
ETC lane clearance is shown in Fig. 10.09.

IC Card Outline (Applicable for Some Types of OBU)
1)
The IC card is basically a contact-less IC card conforming to the ISO/
IEC14443 Type A or Type B standard while contact and combined type of
IC cards based on the ISO/IEC7816 standard are offered as optional.
2)
Interoperability with services other than ETC is offered as optional.
iii)
Payment Methods
1)
Payment method should be basically prepaid.
2)
Re-charge and account balance view opportunities should be provided to
users through IC card issuance and re-charging units at toll plazas and
through other means internet or automatically by credit card similar to VISA
card developed for DMRC (Delhi Metro Rail Corporation).
iv)
On-Board Unit Outline
1)
The on-board unit should be basically a two-piece type or one-piece type
2)
Power is basically sourced from battery or the vehicle’s power plug.
3)
The unit should be able to withstand in-vehicle environment.

Road Side Equipment Outline
1)
Antenna system should be employed in the road side equipment.
2)
The roadside system does not employ vehicle classification feature. Tolls
are
determined based on information including vehicle class registered
to the on-board unit.
3)

vi)
Security
1)
To ensure the security of all data transfers, data should be protected by
encryption, decryption and other means.
2)
Data transferred over radio communication and stored in IC card should be
encrypted, and mutual authentication between road side equipment and IC
card should be performed.
vii)
Toll Evasion Countermeasures
1)
Enforcement cameras are mounted on the gantries or roadside to store
images data of vehicle license plates.
2)
To detect vehicles that evaded payment of toll, license plate information
obtained through road-to-vehicle communication and license plate images
as explained in above (1) are matched.
10.6.3.2 ETC layout
In a toll plaza, the operating speed of vehicles with ETC payment would be higher than that with
Cash payment which could increase the possibility of road accidents. Therefore ETC lane should
be implemented to avoid unnecessary crossing movement.  Fig. 10.10C presents typical layout
of ETC Mechanism. Schematic arrangement of ETC lanes is given in Fig. 10.10D.
10.6.4
Signages and markings
ETC being a non-stop lane would require signages in advance for traffic lane guidance
to avoid complex weaving manoeuvre at toll plaza. Fig. 10.11A presents Guide sign
for ETC.
The ETC lane at the plaza shall have a distinct identification signage adequately
illuminated and placed over the dedicated lane. Fig. 10.11B presents Guide Sign on
Toll Lane Portal.
The portal over the ETC lane shall also have purpose oriented informative features.
For easy identification by driver, the pavement surface of the ETC lane shall be
marked with special type, such as, white chevron marking on blue background and
the word ETC is written on the pavement surface. Fig. 10.11C presents ETC Lane
Marking.

======================================================================
PAGE 460 of 528
======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The toll audit unit would be responsible for the audit of all toll attendants. Toll attendants
must be audited for every hour of duty in order to prevent theft. The people in this unit will
audit a seven day work week for toll collection in a five day period. It is extremely important
that this unit not be understaffed. The toll collection system should provide these individuals
with terminals and a method for making corrections or adjustments to data entered by toll
attendants. It is anticipated that diskettes received from the toll plazas would be loaded
on a central computer for processing. These diskettes would contain information entered
by toll attendants and independent information recorded by treadles and loops regarding
axle counts and transactions. This applies to entry lanes as well as exit lanes. Amounts to
be deposited by attendants would be calculated by the equipment at the toll plaza from
the information contained on toll tickets processed through the exit lane terminal. The
treadles and loops should balance with the axles and transactions accounted for by the
toll tickets processed by the attendant.
The entry-lane audit is as important as the exit lane audit even though no cash is involved.
Transaction and axle counts should be balanced with the tickets issued so as to be certain
that the automatic traffic issuing machine is not issuing extra tickets that can be given to a
friend working at exit-lane or at another toll plaza.

Service Areas
CHAPTER – 11
SERVICE AREAS
11.1
INTRODUCTION
Service Areas (SA) are an integral part of access controlled closed – toll system
expressway. The users of expressway under close toll system need to be provided with
service areas for the users who stop for rest, refreshment and fuelling or for some
emergency requirement.
These service area facilities are expected to rejuvenate during fatigue and thus reducing
accident possibilities.
It is mandatory that facilities provided on expressways should take into account the needs
of the provisions for Persons with Disabilities (PwD). These have been comprehensively
considered and are indicated in Appendix – 11.
11.2
SERVICE AREAS
For the closed toll system, the SAs are planned to be integrated with toll plaza and
interchanges.
11.2.1
Locations
Various research studies have indicated that the drivers would prefer to stop at around
100 km after say one hour drive on high density, high speed corridor like expressway.
Expressway shall have Rest Area(s) planned such that they are spaced at intervals of 30
minutes to one hour of driving time between two important cities/towns, which corresponds
to around 50 – 100 km spacing.  They would not be located between 5 km of a town or city
or near interchange if entrance and exit ramps could cause weaving conflict.
Rest areas shall be planned to cater for traffic moving in both directions such that there is
no need for the vehicles on one carriageway to cross over to the other carriageway.  The
entry to this Rest Area(s) would be through deceleration lane and exit through acceleration
lane.  The minimum width of these lanes shall be 5.5 m.
Rest area(s) shall be designed for the expected peak hour long term clientage and shall
provide facilities for parking, restaurant, cafeteria, toilets, telephone and shops for selling
items normally required for traveling, fuel and garage for minor repair, telephone, first aid.



======================================================================
PAGE 464 of 528
======================================================================
II - 304
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The parking should include parking for expected peak hour truck traffic and cafeteria
suitable for fulfilling the need for Indian truck drivers and shall be paved by CC blocks
strong enough to withstand expected loadings.  The whole area shall be elaborately
landscaped to provide a pleasing environment.
However, the option of integrating a service area with the facilities around an interchange
point require special care / resources when the expressway is implemented under PPP
(Public Private Partnership) format. Additional precautions need to be exercised on
evasion of tolls or misappropriate use of toll tickets.
In combination with functional requirements of man and machines, utilization of scenic
spots along the expressway corridor shall be considered, but not in total wilderness. These
have to be sufficiently close to localities to provide for operation and maintenance of
service facilities, otherwise locality need to developed.
From security considerations, it is of prime consideration that service areas will be provided
near interchanges and at intermediate locations where the distance between successive
interchanges is more than 100 km. In such cases, Wayside Amenities are to be provided
at a point approximately mid way between interchanges.
11.3
SIZE
The process of developing on adequate service area to meet the needs of Heavy
Commercial Vehicle (HCV) drivers, Passenger Car Users, expressway bus users, is a
complex process.  Non availability of such database makes the process more complex.
“AASHTO – Guide for Development of Service Areas on Major Arterials and Freeways –
third edition” – recommends:
a)
Number of parking spaces will dictate minimum size of the site required at
each location;
b)
A minimum size of 5 (five) hectares (50,000 sqm) is required;
c)
Sites upto 15 (fifteen) hectares (150,000 sqm) area are considered generally
manageable and provide ample room for such site development as picnic
areas, children’s playing arena and landscaping. Some additional area may
also be considered to provide emergency services such as medical centre,
trauma centre and even heliports as SoS measures;



======================================================================
PAGE 465 of 528
======================================================================
II - 305
Service Areas
d)
Sites with areas around 35 hectares (350,000 sqm) are considered too
large from maintenance, operation and security considerations. Unless
dictated by topography and other natural barriers such as hillocks, water
bodies, historical monuments and ecologically sensitive areas etc. such a
large size should be avoided.  Otherwise such large sites may be
considered for integrated planning.
The size and composition of the service areas would vary according to the expected
peak traffic (during lunch and dinner times), dwelling/resting time, location, proximity
to facilities and places of special interest. Currently, in India many sources/authorities/
institutions are available that recommend parking – area dimensions. The sizing of
the service area shall also take care of local regulations on solid waste management,
waste disposal, sewerage, drainage and erosion control aspects. The scenic beauties,
natural greeneries and view points shall be given due consideration. Land grading
shall be kept to minimum. In summary, in sizing of service areas, wide spectrum vision
is a necessity.
11.4
AMENITIES/SERVICE FACILITIES
Service Facilities are to be determined depending upon the distance between successive
service areas. As a general guidance ADT related spacing of Facilities/Services are
given  in  Table 11.01. The facility provisions shall include
a)
Parking space for large vehicles including commercial trucks and
expressway buses;
b)
Parking space for small vehicles including cars and minibuses;
c)
Filling stations for petrol, diesel & CNG including compressed air facility

DEVELOPMENT CONTROL
It is desirable that the service areas with amenities be designed, to blend with the
surrounding landscape. Preference should be given for the use of local architectures and
planning considerations. These should be made attractive as value added place through
proper design, landscaping and provision of neatly maintained facilities. Consideration
may be given that land for provision of amenities and service areas is acquired by the
authority. However, these areas could be leased out to the concessionaire or private
developers and entrepreneurs for construction, operation and maintenance of services.
Sufficient space must be earmarked, to allow for anticipated future expansion, with
development of expressway traffic.
11.6
CONCEPTUAL LAYOUT
The basic consideration should be to integrate interchange, service area and bus
stop.  This may produce a combined effect of attraction.  However, the ramp
configuration may become complex.  Other consideration is to separate the parking
area for large vehicles and the parking area for small vehicles. This separation has
been planned with the provision of building with various amenities. With this as basic
consideration, a few conceptual layouts have been developed and are presented as
Fig. 11.01A through Fig. 11.01F.

The pairs are interrelated as near to each other as possible from operation, maintenance
and security considerations. This has also been provided with C-D roads to avoid restrictive
weaving. The facility requires large area and includes all possible needs of the users of
closed toll expressway corridor.

terrain/topographyly or physical constraint for the land requirement. The land may be available
on one side of the expressway. For the other directional users are brought to the service
area through an appropriate grade separated passage (depending on ground conditions).

This layout may be adopted for places with secure land constraint. Such facilities may be
provided for alternate exits to cater for the other direction traffic.

and CNG.
Fig. 11.01E : Presents a small facility where the Interchanges (IC) are more than 40 km
apart. This provides bare minimum urgent requirement. Such facilities are seldom used
since this becomes a standalone facility and leads to higher cost of maintenance, operation
and security provisions.
Fig. 11.01F : Presents the relational layout of the amenities planned to be provided at
various locations. While providing the facilities, the building blocks are planned in a scalable
fashion in modular units – so that the furniture, interiors can be made in modular
configuration. This helps standardizing the service at various centers.
A few pictorial views are presented in Fig. 11.01G for appreciation of the facilities.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
The broad elements of design are:
-
Capacity of Facilities
-
Acceleration and deceleration lanes
-
Internal circulation and distribution of sites equipped for parking
-
Entry and Exit
-
Electrical Systems
-
Road markings, road signs and safety
-
Water supply and sanitary systems
While designing such service area, it is first necessary to take into account the following
considerations:
i)
The distribution of facilities along the expressway
ii)
Topography of the site selected
iii)
Provisions for future expansions
11.7.1
Capacity of facilities
The capacity of facilities at a Service Area shall be arrived at based on anticipated demand
for such facilities.  The number of facility users, and hence the scale of the facility depends
upon the following factors:
-
The AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic)
-
The composition of traffic
-
The types of services offered
-
The distance from other similar services
-
The potential ability of the service area management to render the stop a
pleasant one
-
Proximity to facilities and places of special interest
•
Type of parking lots
-
The type of parking lots is generally equal to three.  They are:

-
Goods vehicle parking lot
•
Number of parking places
Number of parking spaces shall be assessed based on facility spacings.
Number of parking spaces dictate the size of the service areas. Deciding parking space
requirement is a complex process specially in absence of adequate data base. In order
to break through “chicken and egg” situation we have to adopt other country practices.
AASHTO – Guidelines on service area have recommended a system – Analysis
procedure. This requires parameters to be established from statistical data base. For
this Guideline – some decision rules have been adopted for the emerging transportation
scenario in India.
Using the systems approach, the followings are generated as Interim Guidelines for the
designers and planners.
While Table 11.02 has been adopted from Japan documents, Table 11.03 has been
computed using System – Analysis – Procedure with the assumptions for Indian traffic
situations. Computations are presented below:
For this guideline, we may assume Table  11.02 as Minimum values while Table 11.03
as Desirable.

Table 11.03 No. of Parking Spaces Required at Service areas (AASHTO)
Systems-Analysis Procedure: Decision Rules
Traffic volumes, usage surveys, the spacing intervals can be included in a systems analysis
formula to determine parking needs for cars and trucks within a highway section being
studied. Once parking needs have been established, existing areas within that section
can be examined. Analysis of existing parking spaces along a route, size of existing
sites, and other factors will determine whether a new service area is built or an existing
site is upgraded. Similarly, each highway section (package) can be analyzed.
The first step in systems analysis is to identify study sections along a specific highway
route. Each study section is referred to as a design section length (DSL taken as 250 m).
The base spacing interval of 50 m is referred to as the base section length (BSL). Current
and 20-year projected ADTs are established for each DSL to determine parking and
sizing needs. If several ADTs are involved within the section being investigated, then these
are collectively averaged into a single ADT. The forecast design hourly volumes for each
section are similarly determined and averaged. The following equations may then be
used to determine parking needs at each site:

11.7.2.1 Planning
These are the most essential and prime requirement of expressway users. The frequent
cleaning and maintenance operations shall be considered in planning. To keep toilet clean
and bright, special care shall be given to ventilation and natural light intake and lighting
facilities. Cleaning and maintenance operations shall be carried out without closing the
services. In other words, the facilities shall be planned in compartment/enclosures so that
the facility is available while the other portion is being cleaned/maintained.
The toilet shall desirably have an entrance hall which will work as waiting place and through
this hall users can get the entrance door to men and women toilet enclosures. Separate
enclosures shall be provided with baby care and cradle facilities.
Separate toilet shall be provided for Persons with Disabilities (PwD) as brought out in
Appendix-11.
Toilet Facilities
The number of toilet facilities in a public lavatory is depended on the number of users. No
standard guideline is available. The number of toilets and the standard sizes for general

11.7.10
Internal circulation and distribution of sites for parking
The following standards should be followed in the design:
i)
Circulation should be in the same direction as that of the carriageway to
which the area is connected
ii)
Normally the roads and the parts reserved for passenger cars,
separated from those for heavy vehicles, should be located in the
Service Area/Service Area Zone nearest to the Expressway in such a
way that visibility of the facilities is not impeded.  The zone reserved
for heavy vehicles, on the other hand, should be located in the rear
zone of the area.  This principle can be reversed in the case of service
areas where ordinarily the zone farthest from the expressway is the
most suitable for passenger cars

Service Areas
iii)
The parking in the service area should be located in the immediate vicinity
of the refreshment facilities.  This would serve to reduce walking distance
to a minimum and permits keeping an eye on the unattended vehicle.
The best arrangement of the parking places is at a 45o angle with respect
to the transit lanes. This involves the minimum space necessary for parking
manoeuvres. The parking places for 2/3 axle goods vehicles should be
Diagonal Pull Through (DPT) or Diagonal Non-Pull through type (DNPT).
The parking places for articulated/semi-articulated vehicles should however
be Diagonal Pull Through-type.
Parking places for buses should be located near the refreshment facilities
and set up in such a way as to ensure sufficient safety for the passengers
(possibly surrounded by green zones).  The bus parking places should
preferably be DPT-type.
iv)
The access roads to the area and the internal circulation roads shall be
one-way, and have a cross-section not less than 9 m in width, including the
edge markings and shoulders.
All the zones, both for traffic and for stopping, should be separated from the
expressway by a buffer zone not less than 10 m.  This zone should be planted
with vegetation (grass and bushes of limited height). The internal roads of
the service areas should be planned in such a way as to avoid creating
points of conflict.  The service area may be connected to adjoining service
persons area, local habitations by a road of a minimum width of 5.5 m to
provide for the supply of the area with gates and security arrangement for
safety and toll slippage.
v)
The entire service area shall be with boundary walls. Access gates shall be
with security  persons.
11.7.11
Entry and exit
The entry and exit to service area should be located separately independent from each
other and wide enough with as large turning radius as possible. Ramp design shall follow
Chapter-2: Interchange Design 2.6. Collector – Distributor (C-D) roads shall be provided
for the service area traffic to avoid weaving through expressway traffic. This will improve
the ingress and egress facility for the service area.

Lighting
There should be high level of illumination in the parking areas, on the walkways, restaurants,
food plazas and filling stations and surrounding areas for safe and efficient operation. It is
desirable to have the following minimum levels
•
for indoor areas
150-200 lux
•
for closed corridors
100-150 lux
•
for walkways and parking areas
30-40 lux
The lighting requirement shall be planned based on following guidelines
•
IS 3646 (Part II) for Interior Illumination
•
National Electrical Code Published by Bureau of Indian Standards
11.7.13
Electrical systems
The design of the electrical system must take into account the needs of the area in its final
stage.  It is not absolutely necessary to have an electrical system in the service area. The
electrical power will be used for internal and external lighting, cooling and for all the systems
and equipment. All closed convenient areas shall be air conditioned and adequate
ventilation system and full lighting. Full back-up facilities shall be there to meet emergency
during power failure.
11.7.14
Road markings, signs and safety
Besides the warning signs along the expressway, the service areas should be equipped
with road markings and signs for the following purposes.
i)
to limit speeds to 40 kmph
ii)
to give advance warning of junctions
iii)
to prevent stopping outside the zones specifically designated for parking
iv)
to advertise the various services offered by the service area
Service Area Sign shall be provided to inform the driver for exiting of this facility. Sign may
be placed 2 km, 1 km and 500 m advance and information sign i.e. availability of facilities.
Typical service area signs are given in Fig. 11.02A and 11.02B.

Water supply and sanitary systems
The areas should be provided with a water system both for drinking and for industrial
purposes (washing, irrigation, WC), preferably connected with the public networks. A water
system should also be provided for service areas.
The water requirements including all possible uses, can be estimated at 50 litres per user.
The service areas and service areas should be equipped with drainage for the disposal of
rain and waste water, connected with the expressway drainage system. Where it is impossible
to arrange a connection with the public sewerage network, the foul water will have to be treated.
11.7.16
Landscaping
Landscaping assumes particular importance in service areas.  The greenery contributes greatly
to provision of a relaxed atmosphere. The vegetation should necessarily be characteristic of
the local terrain and presenting as wide a variety as possible.  Refreshment and assistance
facilities, fuel station facilities and parking lots should be separated by green zones.  The
parking lots, in particular, should be arranged in such a way as to be shaded by trees or high
shrubbery. The whole zone separating the area from the expressway carriageway should be
planted with greenery, preferably with plants which require little maintenance but of a consistency
such as to constitute a protection against vehicles possibly running off the road and to prevent
pedestrians from attempting to cross the carriageway.  In the vicinity of the nose of the entrance
or the exit, the plants must be of limited height so as not to interfere with driver vision.
11.7.17
Pick-up bus stops
This section has been dealt with in Chapter-12 : Pick-up Bus Stops.
11.7.18
External parking
Wherever an area is connected with the ordinary road system, it will be necessary to
construct a parking lot in the vicinity of the area, outside the fencing and communicating
with it via a passage closed by a gate, but which permits free access to pedestrians.  This
parking lot will permit the following:
i)
Parking of vehicles belonging to service personnel or to those who wish to
enter the area to take advantage of the facilities located there
ii)
The transit of passengers on bus lines with stops at the area in question
iii)
The location of those installations (electrical transformers, water purifying
plants, water tanks, trash bins) generally serviced by external personnel

PICK-UP BUS STOPS
12.1
INTRODUCTION
Combining mass transit in the form of Bus Services is a means for providing optimum
transportation services between metropolitan (important) cities. On the other hand, express
bus operation with few, if any, stops along the expressway provides superior transit service
for outer urban areas and affects expressway operation the least.
12.2
PICK-UP BUS STOPS
The expressway is likely to have regular movement of buses either through Government
or private sector, pickup bus stops shall be planned designed and provided for the
convenience of bus commuters and safe and unimpeded travel on Expressways. These
facilities shall be provided away from the Expressway, connected through properly designed
exit and entry ramps from Expressways.
The expressway bus stops shall be located in the service area adjacent to local bus routes.
For a closed toll system of expressway, the basic philosophy of design is to provide layout
convenient for both local and expressway bus services and not to involve passing through
toll plaza.  Typical location of pick-up bus stops in Service Area is shown in  Fig. 11.01A
through Fig. 11.01C.
Adequate passenger transit facility shall be provided between the Expressway Bus service
and Local Bus Service. Fig. 12.01 presents typical functional arrangements of Expressway
and local bus routes with indicative dimensions for passenger transit facility. Fig. 12.02
presents a pictorial view for appreciation of the designer.

CHAPTER – 13
LIGHTING
13.1
GENERAL
The expressway provides an alignment and profile that, together with other factors,
encourages high operating speeds.  Although improved design will generate significant
benefits, it has also potential problems.  For example, driving at night at high speeds may
lead to reduced forward vision – that is, the inability of headlights to illuminate objects in
the driver’s path in sufficient time for some drivers to respond.
The addition or enhancement of lighting can improve visibility at night, thereby improving
throughout (higher night speeds are possible) and safety.  The objectives of roadway
lighting are as follows:
•
Promotion of safety at night by providing quick, accurate and comfortable
vision for drivers and users.
•
Improvement of traffic flow at night by providing light, beyond that provided by
vehicle lights, which aids drivers in orienting themselves, delineating roadway
geometrics and obstructions, and judging opportunities for overtaking.
•
Illumination in long underpasses and tunnels during the day to permit drivers
entering such structures from the open to have adequate visibility for safe
vehicle operation.
13.2
WARRANTS FOR EXPRESSWAY LIGHTING
The primary purpose of warrants is to assist designers in evaluating locations or lighting
needs and selecting locations for installing.  Meeting these warrants does not obligate to
provide lighting.  Conversely, information in addition to that reflected by the warrants, such
as roadway geometry, ambient lighting, sight distance, crash barriers, signages, or frequent
occurrences of fog, ice, or snow, may influence the decision in favour of lighting.
AASHTO - Warrants for expressway lighting may be comprehensively brought out as
indicated below:



======================================================================

======================================================================
II - 342
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
13.2.1
Continuous expressway lighting
•
Continuous expressway lighting is considered to be warranted on those
sections near cities where the current ADT is 40,000 or more.
•
Continuous expressway lighting is considered to be warranted on those
sections where three or more successive interchanges and cross road are
located with an average spacing of 2.5 km or less, and adjacent areas
outside the right-of-way are substantially urban in character.
•
Continuous expressway lighting is considered to be warranted where for a
length of 3 km or more, the expressway passes near a substantially
developed suburban or urban area in which one or more of the following
conditions exists:
a) local traffic operates on a complete street grid having some form of
street lighting, parts of which are visible from the expressway.
b) the expressway passes near a series of developments such as
residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, colleges, parks,
terminals, etc., which includes roads, streets and parking areas, yards,
etc. that are lighted.
c) the expressway cross section elements, such as median and paved
shoulder, are substantially reduced in width locally below desirable
sections used.
In rural areas each location must be individually evaluated as to its need for
illumination.
13.2.2
Interchange lighting
Complete Interchange Lighting
Complete interchange lighting generally is warranted only if the mainline expressway has
continuous lighting and the adjacent areas of interchange are commercially developed
and illuminated.
Partial Interchange Lighting
•
Partial interchange lighting is considered to be warranted where the total
current ADT of ramp traffic entering and leaving the expressway within the
interchange areas exceeds 5,000 for urban conditions, 5,000 for suburban
conditions, or 2,500 for rural conditions.



======================================================================
PAGE 503 of 528
======================================================================
II - 343
Lighting
•
Partial interchange lighting is considered to be warranted where the current
ADT on the expressway through traffic lanes exceed 25,000 for urban
conditions, 20,000 for suburban conditions, or 10,000 for rural conditions.
13.2.3
Bridge structures and underpasses
Where justified, underpass lighting level and uniformity ratios should duplicate, to the extent
practical, the lighting level on the adjacent facility.  On continuously lighted expressways
and lighted interchanges, the lighting of bridges and overpasses should be of the same
level and uniformity as the roadway.
An underpass is a portion of roadway extending through or beneath some natural or man-
made structure.  Supplementary lighting might be required during the daytime as well as
at night.  Guidance provided by AASHTO (An information guide for Roadway Lighting)  is
summarized below:
•
Length to height ratios of 10:1 or lower will not, under normal conditions,
require underpass lighting during the daytime.  When this ratio is exceeded,
it is necessary to analyze the specific geometry and pavement conditions,
including penetration of daylight on the alignment to determine the need for
daytime lighting.  The transition from bright daylight to lower level of lighting,
and back again to daylight must also be considered.
•
Underpasses that are part of an expressway section with continuous lighting,
warrant the use of (night time) illumination; with the lighting levels and uniformities
duplicating to the extent practical, the lighting values of the expressway. If
continuous lighting is not provided along the adjacent expressway sections,
underpass lighting may still be warranted for night time conditions where unusual
or critical roadway geometry occurs under or adjacent to the underpass area.
13.2.4
Special situations
•
Long tunnels (defined in Tunnel Lighting section) require the use of lighting
or equivalent means to provide adequate roadway and tunnel user visibility
necessary for safe and efficient traffic operations.
•
All Service Areas offering complete rest facilities should be lighted, including
the entrance and exit, the interior roadways, parking areas, and activity areas.
•
Lighting of other specialized areas should be considered with respect to the
needs of the users as well as the requirements of others interacting with the



======================================================================
PAGE 504 of 528
======================================================================
II - 344
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
users.  These other specialized areas include truck weighing stations, inspections
and enforcement areas, park-and-ride lots, toll plazas, and escape ramps.
13.3
TRANSITION LIGHTING
Transition lighting is a technique intended to provide the user with a gradual reduction in
lighting levels and glare when leaving an illuminated area.  In addition, the designer also
may consider extending delineation 300 m beyond the last luminary for traffic lanes
emerging from a lighted area.  This will provide an additional measure of effectiveness.
Vision adjustment when approaching a lighted area is not impacted greatly and therefore
requires no special consideration.
13.4
LIGHTING STANDARDS
The overall quality of an installation for lighting has several components:
•
Average luminance level: This is all-important, as it not only impinges on the
safety benefits but also largely determines the power requirements and hence
the running costs.  In most simpler design processes, and for checking the
performance of an installation, this translates into average illuminance level.
•
Overall uniformity of luminance, or illuminance, both across and along the
roadway.  Defined as the minimum divided by the average, and design at U0.
•
Uniformity of luminance, or illuminance, along the axis of the road, usually
an axis which coincides with a typical driver’s eye position.  Defined as the
ratio of the minimum to the maximum, and designated U1.
•
Glare: As glare has the effect of reducing contrast, a luminary’s “glare
performance”, or optical control, can be expressed in terms of the increase in
background luminance necessary to compensate ( threshold increment, TI ).  The
lower this figure the better.  In highly motorised countries 10 percent  is specified
for motorways, with 15 percent and even 30 percent  allowed for general traffic
routes.  These percentages are determined by the amount of  light the luminaries
project near the horizontal.  This light also causes problems of sky-glow.
•
Guidance: Whilst glare must be kept under control, a small amount of direct
light from the luminaries gives a useful sense of the “run” of the road ahead,
and can forewarn the approach of junctions or roundabouts.

TUNNEL LIGHTING
(Source : CIE 88:2004 Guide for the Lighting of Road Tunnels and Underpasses)
13.5.1
General
The basic objective of tunnel lighting is to ensure that traffic both during day and night
times can approach, pass through and leave the tunnel at the designated speed with
adequate safety and comfort not less than that of expressway section before and after the
tunnel. The lighting in tunnels, especially during day time, poses number of technical and
financial problems.  On bright sunlit days, a great difference in luminance level exists
between exterior and interior luminance which seriously impairs the visual performance
of drivers in adaptation of such abrupt light changes and may lead to hazardous situations.
It is also true that the human eye takes longer time in adaptation from light to dark than
from dark to light. In other words, the design of lighting at entrance zone of tunnel should
be given more attention than at exit zone.
13.5.1.1 Long and short tunnels: defined
A tunnel is a covering over the road.  The lighting requirements for long and short tunnels
differ according to the degree to which the approaching driver can see through the tunnel.
The ability to see through the tunnel depends primarily on the length of the tunnel but also on
other design parameters (width, height, horizontal and/or vertical profile of the tunnel, etc).
For lighting and illumination purpose, tunnels are usually subdivided into “long tunnels” and
“short tunnels”.  This designation refers primarily to the length of the tunnels (typically measured
along the tunnel axis).  Some tunnels – where the drivers cannot see the exit from a point in
front of the tunnel – need to be illuminated like a long tunnel, even if their lengths would seem
to make a “short” one.  These tunnels are designated as “optically long tunnels”, contrary to
those where approaching motorists can see through the tunnel (“optically short tunnels”).
With regard to the lighting, tunnels are subdivided into three classes:
-
geometrically long tunnels;

Fig. 13.01 offers a first approximation.  For a detailed lighting design, the possibilities to
look through the tunnel must be determined graphically.  (Source: CIE 88:2004 Guide for
the Lighting of Road Tunnels and Underpasses)
Note: for tunnel lengths up to 75 m where no daytime lighting is recommended in
Fig. 13.01, it is to be noted that at least one hour before sunset and one hour after
sunrise a lighting level equal to the recommended values for the interior zone of a
long tunnel should be achieved.  At night, only the recommended value for night-time
lighting is needed.

13.5.1.2 Tunnel related zones
(Source: CIE 88:2004 Guide for the Lighting of Road Tunnels and Underpasses)
For tunnel lighting, the tunnel length is divided into various zones to determine the longitudinal
lighting level at daytime lighting.  Those are the access zone, the threshold zone, the transition
zone, the interior zone and the exit zone.  Fig. 13.02 presents various zones in tunnel.
Fig. 13.02 Zones in a Tunnel
(Source : CIE 88:2004)
Access zone: the part of the open road immediately outside (in front of) the tunnel portal,
covering the distance over which an approaching driver must be able to see into the tunnel.
The access zone begins at the stopping distance point ahead of the portal and it ends at
the portal.
Threshold zone: the first part of the tunnel, directly after the portal.  The threshold zone
starts either at the bringing of the tunnel or at the beginning of the daylight sunscreens
when occurring.  The length of the threshold zone is at least equal to the stopping distance.
Transition zone: the part of the tunnel following directly after the threshold zone.  The
transition zone begins at the end of the threshold zone.  It ends at the beginning of the

interior zone.  In the transition zone, the lighting level is decreasing from the level at the
end of the threshold zone to the level of the interior zone.
Interior zone: the part of the tunnel following directly after the transition zone.  It stretches
from the end of the transition zone to the beginning of the exit zone.
Exit zone: the part of the tunnel where, during the day-time, the vision of a driver
approaching the exit is predominantly influenced by the brightness outside the tunnel.
The exit zone begins at the end of the interior zone.  It ends at the exit portal of the tunnel.
Parting zone: the first part of the open road directly after the exit portal of the tunnel.  The
parting zone is not a part of the tunnel, but it is closely related to the tunnel lighting.  The
parting zone begins at the exit portal and a length of more than 200 m is not generally
necessary for lighting.
Entrance portal: the part of the tunnel construction that corresponds to the beginning of
the covered part of the tunnel, or – when open sub-screens are used – to the beginning of
the sun-screens.
Exit portal: the part of the tunnel construction that corresponds to the end of the covered
part of the tunnel, or – when open sub-screens are used – to the end of the sub-screens.

DAYTIME LIGHTING FOR LONG TUNNELS
13.6.1
General
The necessary lighting level in the threshold zone is determined by visibility criteria or, in
other words, by enough contrast.  A driver shall be able to identify other vehicles or objects
Sketch showing the 20° conical field of view referred to in the text

Lighting
in the threshold zone from the stopping distance ahead of tunnel portal.
The luminance in the access zone (defined as  L20, is measured in a conical field of view,
subtending an angle of 200, by a driver located at safe stopping distance from the tunnel
portal and looking towards a cantered point at a height equal to one quarter of the height
of the tunnel opening.
13.6.2
Length of the threshold zone
The total length of the threshold zone must be at least equal to the stopping distance.
Over the first half of the distance, the luminance level must be equal to Lth (the value at the
beginning of the threshold zone).  It is recommended that from half the stopping distance
onwards, the lighting level may gradually and linearly decrease (linear scale) to a value, at
the end of the threshold zone, equal to 0.4 Lth.  See Fig. 13.03.  The gradual reduction
over the last half of the threshold zone may also be in steps.  However, the luminance
levels should not fall below the values corresponding to a gradually decrease, as shown in
the Figure.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
13.6.3
Luminance in the transition zone
The reduction of the luminance of the road in the transition zone follows, in principle, the
curve shown in Fig. 13.03.
The transition zone starts at the end of the threshold zone (t=0).
This curve can be replaced by a stepped curve with levels that should never fall below the
continuous curve.  The maximum luminance ratio permitted on passing from one step to
another is 3.  The last step should not be greater than 2 times the interior zone luminance.
As the field of view of the driver is made up by the tunnel interior, a longer transition zone
may be advisable in order to counteract a second black hole effect.
For additional driving comfort, in the case of the stepped curve, the length of the transition
zone may, at its end, be extended for 1 to 2 seconds over the length that follows from the
CIE-curve.
13.6.4
Daytime luminance in the interior zone
The average luminance of the road in the interior zone of the tunnel is given below as a
function of the stopping sight distance (SSD) and of the traffic flow.  Very long tunnel’s
interior zone consists of two different sub zones.  The first sub zone corresponds to the
length which is covered in 30 seconds and should be illuminated with the “long tunnels”
levels.  The second  sub zone corresponds to the remaining length and should be illuminated
with the “very long tunnels” levels.
a)
A Luminance value of 10 cd/m2 in the interior zone for long tunnels and in
first part of very long tunnels may be considered.
b)
A Luminance value of 5 cd/m2 in the second part of the interior zone for very
long tunnels.
13.6.5
Luminance in the exit zone
In order to ensure adequate direct illumination of small vehicles and sufficient rear vision
via mirrors, the exit zone should be illuminated in the same way as the interior zone of the
tunnel.  In situation where additional hazards are expected near the exit of the tunnel and
in tunnels where the interior zone is long, it is recommended that the daytime luminance in
the exit zone increases linearly over a length equal to the SSD (before that exit portal),

Lighting
from the level of the interior zone to a level five times that of the interior zone at a distance
of 20 m from the exit portal.
13.6.6
Parting zone lighting
In case the tunnel is part of an unlit road and the speed of driving is higher than 50 km/h,
night-time lighting of the parting zone is recommended:
-
if the night-time lighting level in the tunnel is more than 1 cd/m2;
-
if different weather conditions are likely to occur at the entrance and at the
exit of the tunnel.
Road lighting in the parting zone shall be provided over the length of two stopping distances
with road luminance not lower than 1/3 of the night-time luminance in the interior zone of
the tunnel.
13.6.7
Lighting of the walls and the ceiling in all zones
Tunnel walls form part of the background for the detection of obstacles in the tunnel; they
contribute to the adaptation level and to the visual guidance.  Therefore, the luminance of
the tunnel walls is an important component for the quality of the tunnel lighting.  The average
luminance of the tunnel walls, up to at least of 2 m, must be at least 60 percent  of the
average road surface luminance at the relevant locations.
13.6.8
Uniformity of luminance
Good uniformity of luminance must be provided on the road surface and on the walls up to a
height of 2 m.  The lower parts of the walls act as a background for traffic, as does the road.
So both must be considered in the same way.  A ratio of 0.4 for the minimum to the average
value of luminance on the road surface and on the walls up to 2 m lean conditions of the
tunnel is recommended.  A longitudinal uniformity of 0.6 along the centre of each lane is
recommended for the road.  Such values of uniformity must be verified for all dimming steps
of the lighting installation.  Moreover, in the transition zone, as well as in the second half of
the threshold zone (and in the exit  zone if existing), the luminance uniformity shall be calculated
and measured in the central part of each step replacing the continuous variation curve.
13.6.9
Daylight variation and lighting control
The access zone luminance varies with changes in daylight conditions.



======================================================================
PAGE 512 of 528
======================================================================
II - 352
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
As the luminance levels in the threshold and transition zones are constant percentages of
the access zone luminance, it is necessary to provide control of the lighting in these zones.
The control may be done through continuously dimming devices or by switching in separate
steps.
For adequate light control, the access zone light level must be monitored continuously.
The method used for lighting control can be different from the method for the lighting
design.
13.6.10
Glare restriction
As glare reduces visibility, it is important to minimize it. In tunnel lighting, the physiological
(disability) glare has to be considered.  Disability glare effects are quantified by the Threshold
Increment TI as described in CIE 31-1976 “Glare and Uniformity in Street Lighting)”.
The threshold increment TI must be less than 15 percent for the threshold, the transition
and the interior zones of the tunnel at daytime and night-time.  For the exit zone during
daytime no restriction is given.  The following formula shall be used to calculate TI:
TI = 65 (Lv / Lr
0.8) for Lr ≤ 5 cd/m2
TI = 95 (Lv / Lr 1.05) for Lr > 5 cd/m2
with :
Lr - average road surface luminance
Lv - veiling luminance created by all luminaries in the field of view where the axis of
fixation is 10 down from the horizontal at the relevant location.  The calculations
shall be made on the base of the initial values and with a full cut-off angle of 200
above the axis of observation due to the roof of the car.  At present, it is not possible
to give a numerical value for the restriction of the glare in the transition zone.
13.6.11
Restriction of the flicker effect
Flicker sensations are seen when driving through spatially periodic changes in luminance,
such as those produced by daylight screens (both sun-tight and non-sun-tight) or luminaries
that are mounted separately.  Under specific conditions, the flicker may cause discomfort
that sometimes can be severe.



======================================================================
PAGE 513 of 528
======================================================================
II - 353
Lighting
The degree of visual discomfort experienced due to flicker depends upon:
a)
the number of luminance changes per second (flicker frequency)
b)
the total duration of the experience;
c)
the ratio of peak (light) to trough (dark) luminance within each period
(luminance modulation depth) and the steepness in the increase (rise-time).
(a), (b) and (c) depend upon vehicle speed and luminance spacing. (c) also depends
upon the photometric characteristics and the spacing of the luminaries.
In general, the flicker effect is negligible at frequencies below 2.5 Hz and above 15 Hz.
When the frequency is between 4 Hz and 11 Hz, and has duration of more than 20 s,
discomfort may arise provided no other measures are taken.  It is recommended that, in
installation where the duration is more than 20 s, the frequency range between 4 Hz and
11 Hz should be avoided.
13.6.12
Night-time lighting
a)
If the tunnel is on a section of an illuminated road, the quality of the lighting
inside the tunnel should be at least equal to the  level, uniformities and glare
of the access road. The uniformity at night of tunnels shall fulfil the same
requirements as the daytime lighting.
b)
If the tunnel is a part of an unlit road, the average road surface luminance
inside must be around 4-5 cd/m2, the overall uniformity at least 40 percent
and the longitudinal uniformity at least 60 percent.
13.6.13
Emergency lighting
In the event of a failure in the normal power source that supplies the lighting system, it is
recommended that an emergency on interruptible power supply is employed to energize
sufficient system luminaries. Conventionally the “emergency” luminaries form a part of
stage 1 being the normal night-time level throughout the tunnel. The emergency
configuration by example could consist of : one lamp from a selection of the system
luminaries, forming a linear symmetrical and inter spaced series of emergency
luminaries, being energized from the uninterruptible power supply source. It is
recommended that the average illuminance level of the emergency lighting should be at
least 10 lux with 2 lux being the minimum level at any location within the tunnel.  For
recommendations relating to escape lighting in the event of a fire, appropriate references
and standards should be sought by the designer (e.g. EN 1838), as it is not intended for
this document to cover the specific demands required by such circumstances.

Lighting in other places
At other places associated with the expressways, the lighting shall be provided on individual
considerations of the functional requirements.  Japan practices are given below:
•
Interchange lighting
Interchange lighting, which is installed at convergence/divergence points and
at ramps on expressways, is required to provide an average road surface
luminance of 1 cd/m2 (average road surface luminance of approx. 15 lux).
The number of lights installed depends on the traffic volumes of the
expressway and interchange.
•
Toll booth plaza lighting
Toll booth plaza lighting is installed to provide an average road surface
luminance of 20 lux in the plaza, and it provides an average vertical surface
luminance of 40 lux where it is necessary to identify the type of motor vehicle.
•
Service and Parking area lighting
Service and parking area lighting is installed at convergence and divergence
points and ramp ways on the expressway and provides an average road
surface luminance of 1 cd/m2.
The number of lights installed depends on the traffic volumes on the
expressway and the volume of vehicles entering/leaving the area.
Lighting inside parking areas has an average road surface luminance of
10 lux, and suitable lighting is also installed along sidewalks.
•
Pick-up Bus Stop lighting
Pick-up bus stop lighting provides an average road surface luminance of
10 lux at and near the platform.
13.7
GUIDANCE FACILITIES DURING NIGHT TIME
13.7.1
Interior/exterior illuminated signs
As interior illuminated signs provides night time visibility and guidance superior to that of
externally illuminated signs, they are used as important signs such as expressway exit signs.

Blinker lights
Blinker lights are yellow flashing light to alert drivers to the existence of interchanges and
parking area entries or branch points etc. to prevent collisions and merging accidents.
13.7.3
Delineators
This is erected along the roadsides and indicates the road alignment. It functions
mainly at night to guide the drivers.  The delineator is effective in promoting safe
driving by providing advance information of the alignment, which serves to prevent
traffic accidents.
The colour and number of delineators are determined by the location, as in Table 13.01A
and 13.01B. The arrangement Horizontal Vertical too is fixed in cases of more than two
reflectors on the post to indicate where expressway runs and locating of interchange and
facilities at night.
It is standard practice to locate delineators on the left side of the carriageway, at a
distance of 120 cm from road surface to the center of the reflector and with 50 cm
clearance.
The delineator is installed 90 cm from the road surface on the median side of the
main roadway and on an interchange ramp way. It is attached directly on the front
surface of guard rails, it is installed 60 cm away from the marginal strip. Installation
methods of Delineator and Delineator for concrete Barrier are shown in Table
13.01A and 13.01B.

Spacing and Placement of Delineators
The spacing of delineators depends on the alignment radius. For expressways and ramps
on interchanges, the speed values range between 40 – 120 kmph and the corresponding
minimum/desirable radius varies from 60 m to 1000 m.
IRC:79-1981 recommended spacing values compared fairly to MUTCD-2003 values.
Moreover, MUTCD-2003 has recommend a formula for spacing computation as
15
7.1
−
=
R
S
 where: S = Delineator Spacing in meter, R = Radius in meter
For expressway on tangent/transition section, the spacing of the first (for the beginning of curve)
delineator shall be 2S, the second at 3S and the third at 6S limited to maximum of  50 m.
On Expressway tangent sections, Delineators should be spaced 50 to 70 m apart.
On merging, diverging areas and in tunnels, desirably the spacing may be reduced to
50 percent of normal sections.
For this Guideline, the above recommendations shall be used.

GLARE REDUCTION
1)
Purpose
Glare reduction devices are installed for reducing the headlight glare of opposing traffic
at night which may distract from driving tasks.
2)
Place of Installation
Installation of glare reduction devices depends on many factors such as accident
experience, high night-time traffic volumes and complaints from the public or highway
geometry. Additional factors include distance between opposing traffic, lane width
restrictions, narrow median, barrier type, vertical and horizontal curvature.
Glare reduction devices are generally installed on the median strips, in bridge and overpass
sections, on horizontal curves and in cut and embankment sections without vegetation. Generally
these shall be placed at 4 to 6 m spacing.  However, 4 m spacing would be desirable.
Installation of glare reduction devices can be omitted in the sections with the following
characteristics.
a)
The median strip has a width of 7 m or larger.
b)
The difference in the elevation of centreline in opposing directions is 2 m or
greater.
c)
Lighting devices are installed continuously, which regulate use of head lights
on high beam.
3)
Structural Specifications
i)
Height
The height of a glare reduction device is set at 1.4 to 1.5 m on the assumption
of combinations of opposing passenger vehicles and of a passenger car
and a large-size vehicle running in the opposite directions.
ii)
Shading Angle
For 2 x 3 lane dual carriageway with 5.5 m median and 3.75 m lane width,
the shading angle θ in the case where passenger vehicles passing other

In order to reduce the headlight glare of a vehicle passing other vehicles for
another vehicle travelling in the opposite direction, greater shading angle is
required. Full shading, however, narrows the view of the driver and restricts
view of opposing traffic for the authorized personnel in patrol vehicle.
Therefore, a shading angle of approximately 5 to 10 degrees has been
selected to provide partial shading.
iii)
Desirable characteristics of a glare screen shall generally be the
following:
•
Will not penetrate the passenger compartment or present an undue risk
to workers and other traffic when hit
•
Performs in a predictable manner when hit
•
Effectively reduces glare
•
Is resistant to vandalism and vehicle damage and
•
Is easy to repair

Noise Barriers
CHAPTER – 14
NOISE BARRIERS
14.1
NOISE BARRIERS
14.1.1
General
Noise barriers are solid obstructions (acoustically) built between the expressway and the
receptors. It is reported that effective noise barriers can reduce noise levels by 10 to 15
decibels, cutting the loudness of traffic to half.
Barriers can be formed from earth mounds, reinforced earthen embankment or high vertical
walls. Noise walls can be built of wood, stucco, concrete, masonry, metal and other
materials. New designs are developing fast that are pleasing, that blend with surroundings
and reduce tunnel effect with visually transparent materials.
As a broad guidelines, FHWA considers a minimum 10 dB insertion loss (IL) is to be
considered for the provision of Noise barrier.
14.1.2
Noise barriers for expressways
Most of the barriers are either made of concrete (pre-cast or cast-in-situ), metal panels and
these reduce noise passing through such walls. But these may block sunlight, road side vision
and may produce tunnel / prison wall effect. The large flat surfaces attract graffiti and screenings
that can create loud echoes otherwise which were meant to make the environment quiet.
The noise barrier material selection process shall broadly consider
i)
Pleasant Aesthetics
To break monotony and tunnel effect, combined with considerations of safety,
it is desirable to combine the concrete or metal forms with transparent (see
through) materials. The combination shall create unique architectural
alternative alongwith desirable noise control.
ii)
Impact Resistance
Sound barriers are often subjected to impacts caused by stones or other
debris thrown up by vehicle tyres. Therefore, barrier materials are desirable
to withstand these impact forces. Concrete and metal have negligible effect,
whereas transparent material need special considerations.



======================================================================
PAGE 522 of 528
======================================================================
II - 362
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-II: DESIGN
iii)
Graffiti Resistance
The surfaces need to be textured so that no mark (i.e. graffiti work) could be
made on the surface. Even if some marks are there, the same shall be
washable with (hot / cold) water.
iv) Durability
Compared to clear plastics and glasses, the poly-carbonate based
materials are reported to offer greater resistances to impact and
maintains durability against wide range of temperature such as from -
200 C to +900 C.
v)
Safety
Being transparent, the wall reduces the risk of vandals hiding behind the
wall. The material surface is generally corrugated which minimizes hazardous
glare from sunlight or head lights from opposing vehicles.
vi) Low Maintenance Cost
Concrete, metals or transparent materials shall be easy to clean and shall
require minimum maintenance attention.
14.1.3
Noise barrier placement and reduction effect
The degree of attenuation provided by a noise barrier is mainly a function of (1) the
diffraction angle α through which the sound path must be bent in order to get from source
to receiver and (2) the frequency of the sound source.
Five main factors that influence the acoustic effectiveness of a barrier are: (1) distance
(offset), (2) height, (3) continuity, (4) length, and (5) mass.
An additional factor influencing the acoustic effectiveness of a barrier is the sound absorption
capability of the barrier, i.e., the degree to which it minimizes reflection of sound.
Distance (Placement of Barrier):
A sound barrier should be erected as close as possible to either the noise source or the
receiving position in order to maximize the diffraction angle.



======================================================================
PAGE 523 of 528
======================================================================
II - 363
Noise Barriers
Height of Barrier:
The minimum height of the barrier should be such that the line of sight between source
and receiver is interrupted.
Continuity of Barrier:
No gaps or holes should be present in a noise barrier. It must be effectively airtight.
Length of Barrier:
As a guideline, the length of a noise barrier should be at least 2 to 3 times the distance
between the barrier and the protection structure to minimize sound diffraction around the
ends of the barrier.
Noise reduction effect: Generated noise generally dissipates with distance, land use and
the nature of vegetation, forests etc. Table 14.01 Highway Noise at various distances from
source of the noise and Fig. 14.01 Typical Effect of Noise Barrier – presents the noise
reduction effect of the barrier and Fig. 14.02 presents extents of barrier requirement. These
two help designers in selection / fixation of alignment. Needed length of barrier to protect
the target / receptor are i) desirably three times the distance of the targets / receptor, from
the highway edge and ii) minimum two times the distance or 50 m whichever is more.
Note: Source is emitting noise of 100 dB

Type of noise barriers
As designers aid, some typical arrangements of noise barriers (mostly from Japan) have
been included. These include some typical arrangements on embankment and structures
(bridges) in the form of sketches and pictorial views.
Fig. 14.03 presents typical noise barriers while Fig. 14.04 and Fig. 14.05 presents typical
arrangement of metal panel on pile foundation and on bridges respectively. Fig. 14.06
presents typical pictorial views of transparent type noise barriers. Transparent type is
preferable for the drivers as it provides view of the adjoining areas.  However, periodic
cleaning is necessary to maintain the transparency.
