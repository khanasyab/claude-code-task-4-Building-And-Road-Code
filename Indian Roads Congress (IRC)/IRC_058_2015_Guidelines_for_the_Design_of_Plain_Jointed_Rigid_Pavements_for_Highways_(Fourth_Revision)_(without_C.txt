Guidelines  FOR THE dESIGN OF pLAIN jOINTED rIGID  
pAVEMENTS FOR hIGHWAYS
1  Introduction
Guidelines for the Design of the Rigid Pavements for Highways were first published in 1974. 
The first revision of the guidelines was made in 1988 after the upward revision of the legal 
limit on the maximum laden axle loads of commercial vehicles from 8160 kg to 10200 kg. The 
second revision was brought out in 2002 to includefatigue damage concept in design. The 
third revision of the document was published in 2011.
Taking into account the further developments in the area of rigid pavements during the past 
years a revised draft of the guidelines was prepared by Dr. B.B. Pandey with the support of 
the Transportation Engineering Section of Civil Engineering Department of Indian Institute of 
Technology, Kharagpur. The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) deliberated on the document 
in a series of meetings and finalsed it in its meeting held on 19th December, 2014 for placing 
before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS). The HSS Committee 
approved the revised draft of IRC:58 “Guidelines for the Design of Plain Jointed Rigid 
Pavements for Highways” in its meeting held on 12th January, 2015. The Council of IRC in 
its 204th meeting held on 19th January, 2015 at Bhubaneshwar (Odisha) approved the same 
after taking on board the comments offered by the members.

2  SCOPE
2.1	
The guidelines cover the design of plain jointed cement concrete pavements with 
and without tied concrete shoulders. These are applicable to roads having an average daily 
commercial vehicles more than 450 with laden weight exceeding 3 tonnes. IRC:SP:62 may 
be referred for design of low-volume Rural Roads.
3  GENERAL
3.1	
The current version of IRC:58 aims at rationalising the design procedure by 
bringing it at par with current trends in design considering cumulative fatigue damage due to 
the combined effect of load and pavement temperature. The guidelines also include procedure 
for design of pavements with widened outer lane, tied concrete shoulder, pavements bonded 
to stabilized subbase as well as design of longitudinal, expansion and contraction joints.
3.2	
The Salient Features of the Current Guidelines are:-
	
i)	
Design of pavements considering the flexural stress under the simultaneous 
action of load and temperature gradient for different categories of axles.
	
ii)	
Design considering sum of cumulative fatigue damages caused by single, 
tandem and tridem axle load applications due to tensile flexural stresses at 
the top and the bottom of the pavement slab.
	
iii)	
Consideration of in-built permanent curl in the analysis of flexural stresses.
	
iv)	
Design guidelines for pavements without concrete shoulders and with tied 
concrete shoulders.
	
v)	
Consideration of Concrete slabs with unbonded as well as bonded cement 
bound subbase.
	
vi	
Design of pavements with widened outer lanes.

There can be many different considerations other than what are given above and designers 
may use their knowledge and experience.
3.3	
The guidelines may need revision from time to time in the light of field performance 
of rigid pavements, future research findings and development of better analytical tools. It is 
recommended that all the organizations that are concerned with design, construction and 
maintenance of rigid pavements should keep a detailed record of the year of construction, 
Traffic, Subgrade CBR, properties and gradation of granular subbase, strength of Dry Lean 
Concrete (DLC) and Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC), roughness, cracking, faulting at 
joints and cracks, falling weight deflection data etc. so that these can be used in future 
revision of the guidelines.
4  Concrete Pavement Types
4.1	
Several types of concrete pavements have been used in different countries 
depending upon the climate, availability of materials, soil types, experience and traffic. A 
designer may select the most appropriate composition of a concrete pavement depending 
upon his/her experience. Typical cross sections of two pavements are shown in Fig. 1. When 
PQC is laid over a bituminous surface during the sunshine it is important to whitewash the 
surface of BC (Fig. 1 (b)) because black body absorbs more heat which may be injurious to 
concrete.

Note :	 PQC: Pavement Quality Concrete, DLC: Dry Lean Concrete, BC: Bituminous Concrete, For 
Subgrade with CBR ≥ 8, both the granular separation and drainage layers can be replaced 
with Synthetic geocomposite.
5  FACTORS GOVERNING DESIGN
5.1	
The main factors governing design of concrete pavements are design period, 
design commercial traffic volume, composition of commercial traffic in terms of single, tandem, 
tridem and multi-axles, axle load spectrum, tyre pressure, lateral placement characteristics, 
directional distribution, strength of foundation and climatic considerations.

5.2	
Axle Load Characteristics
Though the legal axle load limits in India are 10.2 tonnes (100 kN), 19.0 tonnes (186 kN) 
and 24.0 tonnes (235 kN) for single, tandem and tridem axles respectively, a large number 
of axles operating on National Highways carry much heavier loads than the legal limits. Data 
on axle load spectrum of the commercial vehicles is required to estimate the repetitions 
of single, tandem and tridem axles in each direction expected during the design period. 
Minimum percentages of commercial vehicles to be weighed should be 10% of the volume of 
Commercial Vehicles Per Day (CVPD) exceeding 6000, 15% of cvpd for 3000 to 6000 and 
20% of cvpd if less than 3000. Axle load survey may be conducted for a continuous 48-hour 
period. The vehicles to be surveyed may be selected randomly to avoid bias. If the spacing 
of consecutive axles (wheel base) is more than 2.4 m, each axle shall be considered as a 
single axle. The intervals at which axle load groups should be classified for fatigue damage 
analysis are:-
	
Single axle	
10 kN
	
Tandem axle	
20 kN
	
Tridem axle	
30 kN
For most of the commercial highway vehicles, the commonly used tyre inflation pressures 
range from about 0.7 MPa to 1.0 MPa. It is found that stresses in concrete pavements having 
thickness of 200 mm or higher are not affected significantly by the variation of tyre pressure. 
A tyre pressure of 0.8 MPa is adopted for design in these guidelines.
5.3	
Wheel Base Characteristics
Information on typical spacing between successive axles of commercial vehicles is necessary 
to identify the proportion of axles that should be considered for estimating top-down fatigue 
cracking caused by axle loads during night period. The slab has the tendency of curling up 
due to negative temperature differential. Data on the spacing of axles may be collected during 
the traffic survey. As discussed in subsequent sections of these guidelines, if the spacing 
between any pair of consecutive axles is less than the spacing of transverse joints, such 
axles need to be considered in the design traffic for computing top-down fatigue cracking 
damage. Wheel bases of trucks of different models generally range from 3.6 m to more than 
5.0 m whereas the commonly used spacing of transverse joints is 4.5 m. Thus, axles with 
spacing of more than 4.5 m will not contribute to top-down fatigue cracking. However, if the 
actual spacing of transverse joints is different from 4.5 m, design traffic for estimation of 
top-down cracking damage may be selected appropriately. The percentage of commercial 
vehicles with spacing between the front and the first rear axle less than the proposed spacing 
of the transverse joints in the concrete slab should be established from axle load survey.
5.4	
Design Period
Cement concrete pavements may be designed to have a life span of 30 years or more. 
However, the design engineer should use his/her judgment about the design period taking 
into consideration factors such as traffic volume, uncertainty of traffic growth rate, the capacity 
of the road and the possibility of augmentation of capacity by widening.

5.5 
Traffic Consideration
5.5.1	
Design Lane
The lane carrying the maximum number of heavy commercial vehicles is termed as design 
lane. Each lane of a two-way two-lane highway and the outer lane of multi-lane highways can 
be considered as design lanes.
5.5.2	
Design Traffic
5.5.2.1	
Assessment of average daily traffic should normally be based on seven-day 
24-hour count made in accordance with IRC:9 “Traffic Census on Non-Urban Roads”. The 
actual value of annual rate of growth ‘r’ of commercial vehicles should be determined using 
appropriate methods. As per IRC:SP:84, annual growth rate of commercial vehicles shall 
be taken to be a minimum of 5%. The traffic counts and the corresponding traffic estimates 
should indicate the day and night traffic trends as the traffic during the day hours is generally 
responsible for bottom-up cracking whereas the night time traffic may lead to top-down 
cracking.
5.5.2.2	
The edge flexural stress caused by axle loads for bottom up cracking is maximum 
when the tyre imprint of the outer wheel touches the longitudinal edge. When the tyre position 
is away even by 150 mm from the longitudinal edge, stress in the edge region is reduced 
substantially. The edge flexural stress is small when the wheels are close to the transverse 
joints. Typical lateral distribution characteristics of wheel paths of commercial vehicles 
observed on Indian highways indicate that very few wheels of vehicles are tangential to 
the longitudinal edge or longitudinal joint on two-lane two-way roads and divided multi-lane 
highways. Some multi-lane divided highways have 8.5 m to 9.0 m wide carriageways with 
a single longitudinal joint in the Centre. The lane markings in these cases may not coincide 
with the longitudinal joint resulting in a larger proportion of wheel paths being positioned 
close to the longitudinal joint compared to the situation where the lane markings match the 
longitudinal joints.
5.5.2.3	
Taking into consideration these issues, it is recommended that 25 percent 
of the total two-way commercial traffic may be considered as design traffic for two-lane 
two-way roads for the analysis of fatigue damage In the case of four-lane and other 
multi-lane divided highways, 25 percent of the total traffic in the direction of predominant 
traffic may be considered for design of pavement.
5.5.2.4	
The design traffic for top-down cracking analysis will usually be a fraction of the 
design traffic considered for bottom-up cracking analysis. Only those commercial vehicles 
with the spacing between the front axle and the first rear axle less than the spacing of 
transverse joints is considered for the analysis of top-down cracking. This percentage should 
be established from axle load / traffic survey. A default value of fifty percent of the design 
traffic for the bottom-up cracking analysis may be considered for the analysis of top down 
cracking.
5.5.2.5	
In case of new highway links, where no traffic count data is available, data from 
roads of similar classification and importance may be used to predict the design traffic 
intensity.

5.5.2.6	
Expected number of applications of different axle load groups during the design 
period can be estimated using the details of commercial traffic volume, expected rate of 
growth of commercial traffic, the information about axle load spectrum and the number of 
single, tandem and tridem axles obtained from axle load survey. Front axles (steering axle) 
with single wheels on either side cause only negligible bottom-up fatigue damage.
5.5.2.7	
The cumulative number of commercial vehicles during the design period may be 
estimated from the following expression.

5.6	
Temperature Consideration
5.6.1	
Temperature Differential
5.6.1.1	
Temperature differential between the top and bottom fibres of concrete pavements 
causes the concrete slab to curl, giving rise to stresses. The temperature differential is a 
function of solar radiation received by the pavement surface, wind velocity, thermal diffusivity 
of concrete, latitude, longitude and elevation of the place and is thus affected by geographical 
features of the pavement location. As far as possible, temperature differential values 
estimated realistically for the given site using relevant geographical parameters and material 
characteristics should be used for analysis. In the absence of any local data, the maximum 
temperature differential values given in Table 1 may be adopted for pavement design. The 
variation of temperature with depth is non-linear during the day time and nearly linear during 
night hours. The maximum temperature differential during the night is nearly half of the day 
time maximum temperature differential.
5.6.1.2	
Temperature differentials are positive when the top surface of a pavement slab 
has the tendency to have a convex shape during the day hours and negative with a concave 
shape during the night. The axle load stresses should be computed for fatigue analysis when 
the slab is in a curled state due to the temperature differential during day as well as night 
hours.

5.6.2	
Zero Stress Temperature Gradient
5.6.2.1	
Cement concrete pavements are usually laid during the night hours in India due 
higher day temperatures. The pavement slabs laid during late night and early hours may 
have high positive temperature gradients due to intense solar radiation during the day hours 
and chemical reaction in the cemented mass before the setting of the concrete .Even when 
positive temperature differential occurs in concrete during the day time, the slab remains 
flat during the hardening process because of its plastic stage. The slab is stress free in 
this condition with higher temperature on the top surface and lower at the bottom fibre and 
the corresponding temperature gradient is known as ‘zero stress temperature gradient’. 
Research on in-service concrete pavements indicates that exposure of fresh concrete to sun 
and high air temperature during the hardening stage causes building of permanent curl in the 
concrete pavements which is nearly equivalent to the curl caused by a negative temperature 
differential of about 5ºC. This equivalent negative temperature differential has to be added 
algebraically to the actual temperature differential prevailing at any time. Field investigations

on existing pavements located in different regions of the country will be necessary to establish 
the zero stress temperature gradient for different regions in India for future guidance.
5.6.2.2	
If the maximum positive temperature differential during the day time is 20ºC, 
the temperature differential for stress computation can be taken as 15ºC. However, this 
5ºC reduction is generally not made so that the design for bottom-up cracking will be 
conservative.
5.6.2.3	
During the night hours, if the temperature differential is 10ºC, the total effective 
negative temperature differential can be taken as 15ºC (10ºC + 5ºC). If mist spray of water 
can be applied over the curing compound during the period of intense solar radiation during 
day time, the built-in permanent curl will be less. It is safer to consider the effective negative 
temperature gradient for checking the slab for top-down cracking caused by the combined 
effect of traffic loads and night time negative temperature differential.
5.6.2.4	
It is ideal to carry out hourly cumulative fatigue damage analysis but data for 
carrying out such an exercise is not available. It is suggested that the maximum positive and 
negative temperature differentials respectively may be assumed to be constant for the six 
hour period during the day between 10 AM and 4 PM and for the six hour period between 
0 AM to 6 AM during night hours. The slab may be assumed to be free of curling stresses for 
the remaining 12 hours for the purpose of fatigue damage analysis as the fatigue damage 
caused by the combined action of load and temperature differential will be insignificant 
during this period. The timings refer to Indian Standard time and may be different for different 
geographical locations in India.
5.7	
Embankment Soil and Characteristics of Subgrade and Subbase
5.7.1	
CBR of embankment soil placed below the 500 mm select subgrade should be 
determined for estimating the effective CBR of subgrade and its ‘k’ value for design.
5.7.2	
The nature of embankment foundation strata such as expansive clays, marine 
clays, soft clays, black cotton soil, etc. needs to be studied to take special measures like 
consolidation of the strata by accelerated pore pressure dissipation, removal of expansive 
black cotton soil strata and its replacement by non-expansive soil, use of geo synthetics to 
arrest tension cracks or soil stabilization etc. Soil swell can be controlled by surcharge loads 
or by placing the swelling soils in the lower part of an embankment. Selective grading and 
soil mixing is also helpful. In deep cut sections, removal of overburden soils causes soils to 
swell. It is, therefore, advisable to excavate deep cuts in advance of other grading work to 
allow expansion to occur and stabilize. Expansive soils should be compacted at 1-3 percent 
above Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) as determined by Modified Proctor compaction. 
The soil should not be allowed to dry out excessively before GSB and other layers are laid. If 
non-expansive soils are not available, it may be more economical to modify the existing soil 
with lime or cement or both. A thorough study needs to be undertaken on case specific basis 
and detailed treatment of foundation strata is beyond the scope of these guidelines.
5.7.3	
Subgrade
5.7.3.1	
The subgrade is usually considered as a Winkler foundation, also known as dense 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 104
======================================================================

IRC:58-2015
9
liquid foundation. In Winkler model, it is assumed that the foundation is made up of springs 
supporting the concrete slab. The strength of subgrade is expressed in terms of modulus of 
subgrade reaction, k, which is defined as the pressure per unit deflection of the foundation as 
determined by plate load tests. The k-value is determined from the pressure sustained at a 
deflection of 1.25 mm. As k-value is influenced by test plate diameter, the standard test is to 
be carried out with a 750 mm diameter plate. IS:9214, “Method of Determination of Modulus 
of Subgrade Reaction of Soil in the Field” may be referred to for guidance in this regard. 
A frequency of one test per km per lane is recommended for assessment of k-value. If the 
foundation changes with respect to subgrade soil, type of subbase or the nature of formation 
(i.e. cut or fill) then additional tests may be conducted.
5.7.3.2	
Though 750 mm is the standard plate diameter, smaller diameter plate can be 
used in case of homogeneous foundation from practical consideration and the test values 
obtained with plates of smaller diameter may be converted to the standard 750 mm plate 
value using equation 2.
	
	
	
k750 = kΦ (1.21 Φ + 0.078)
... (2) 
where,
	
Φ

kΦ	
=	
modulus of subgrade reaction (MPa/m) with plate diameter Φ metre
	
k750	 =	
modulus of subgrade reaction (MPa/m) with plate diameter of 750 mm (k)
5.7.3.3	
The estimate obtained from Equation 2 is regarded as approximate only. However, 
in case of layered construction, the tests conducted with smaller plates give greater weight 
age to the stronger top layer, and direct conversion to 750 mm plate values using Equation 2 
results in somewhat over-estimation of the foundation strength.
5.7.3.4	
The subgrade soil strength and consequently the strength of the foundation as a 
whole, is affected by its moisture content. Since it is not convenient to determine the k-value 
in the field at different moisture contents and densities, CBR tests may be carried out at field 
moisture content and field density both in soaked and un-soaked condition and the measured 
k-value from plate load test may be corrected in the ratio of CBR values under soaked and 
un-soaked conditions to obtain the k-value corresponding to the weakest condition of 
subgrade. The plate load test is time-consuming and expensive and, therefore, the design 
k-value is often estimated from soaked CBR value. The relationship between the CBR and 
k-value illustrated in Table 2 can be used for this purpose.

If the CBR of the 500 mm thick compacted subgrade is significantly larger 
than that of the embankment below it, the effective CBR of the subgrade can be estimated 
from Fig. 2.

5.7.3.6	
A minimum CBR of 8% is recommended for the 500 mm of the select soil used as 
subgrade.
5.7.3.7	
The in-situ CBR of the subgrade soil can also be determined quickly from 
the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (60º cone) tests using the following relationship 
(ASTMD 6951).

5.7.3.8	
The modulus of subgrade reaction of the subgrade of an in-service pavement or 
of a prepared foundation can also be determined by conducting Falling Weight Deflectometer 
(FWD) tests. The k-value of the subgrade back calculated from FWD test data is the dynamic 
k-value. The corresponding static k-value, which should be used for analysis, can be estimated 
as 50% of the dynamic k-value obtained from FWD test as recommended AASHTO 1993 
Pavement Design Guide.
5.7.3.9	
The subgrade needs to be protected by providing separation and drainage layers 
of Granular Subbase (GSB) above it to prevent (i) excessive softening of subgrade and 
GSB and (ii) erosion of the subgrade and subbase particularly under adverse moisture 
condition and heavy dynamic loads. GSB Gr I/II/V/VI (MORTH 5th rev) may be as used as 
separation layer to prevent fines from migrating to the drainage layer and coke it. IRC:15, 
IRC:SP:42 and IRC:SP:50 may be referred to for the design criteria of the separation 
layer also known as filter layer. International practice for drainage layer is discussed in 
Appendix VI. The gradations for the drainage layers may be adopted from several gradations 
given in the Appendix VI since GSB of MORTH have low permeability as discussed in 
Appendix VI. Open graded drainage layer is unstable under construction traffic and it may 
be stabilized with 1.5 to 2% bitumen or 3% bituminous emulsion or 2 to 2.5% cement to 
impart stability to it. Commercially available synthetic geo-composite layer can also be used 
at the interface of subgrade and granular subbase layer for separation and drainage in place

of granular layers. It will also not allow the migration of fine particles to the granular layer 
while maintaining a good horizontal permeability.
5.7.4	
Stabilised Subbase
5.7.4.1	
The main purpose of the subbase is to provide a uniform, stable and permanent 
support to the concrete slab laid over it. It must have sufficient strength so that it is not 
subjected to disintegration and erosion under heavy traffic and adverse environmental 
conditions such as excessive moisture, freezing and thawing. In the light of these requirements, 
a subbase of Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) having a 7-day average compressive strength of 
7 MPa determined as per IRC:SP:49 over GSB is recommended for highways. Minimum 
recommended thickness of DLC for major highways is 150 mm. For PQC bonded to DLC 
the 7 day strength of DLC should not be less than 10 MPa. The surface of DLC is to be 
roughened with wire brush within 3-6 hours of laying.
5.7.4.2	
Availability of good quality aggregates has become a big hurdle in the 
construction of pavements because of closures of old quarries, restriction on opening of 
new quarries from environmental considerations. Similar problems are being faced in 
other countries also. International practice on the use of cemented/stabilized subbases is 
discussed in Appendix I. In the light of international experience, a minimum characteristic 
28-day compressive strength of 7 MPa is recommended for cement treated subbases with 
recycled or marginal aggregates while ensuring that the support is permanent, uniform and 
non-erodible. Use of BC2 as per MORTH (5th rev) as a debonding layer over cement treated 
GSB shown in Fig. 1 (b) is recommended to allow expansion and contraction of the pavement 
slabs. The dense graded BC is resistant against stripping and concrete pavements with 
a debonding layer of BC shown in Fig. 1(b) are known to give good performance. Loss 
of weight of cement treated subbases shall not exceed 14% after 12 cycles of “Wetting 
and Drying Test/freezing and thawing” tests as per BIS:4332 (Part IV) - 1968. Freezing and 
thawing test is relevant for snow bound regions of Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, 
Arunachal Pradesh etc.
5.7.4.3	
In the case of problematic subgrades such as clayey and expansive soils 
appropriate provisions shall be made for a blanket course in addition to the subbase as per 
the relevant stipulations of IRC:15.
5.7.4.4	
Effective k-values of different combinations of subgrade and subbase (untreated 
granular and cement treated granular) can be estimated from Table 3. For concrete pavements 
laid over a bituminous subbase, the k-value can be adopted from IRC:SP:76. k-values for 
different combinations of DLC subbase (with DLC having minimum 7-day compressive 
strength of 7 MPa) thicknesses laid over granular subbase consisting of separation and 
drainage layers can be adopted from Table 4. The contribution of granular subbase placed 
below the DLC layer can be ignored for estimating the effective modulus of subgrade 
reaction of the foundation. The values given in Table 4 are based on the analysis given in the 
Pavement Design Guide AASHTO:1993 and an upper limit of 300 MPa/m is recommended 
considering the loss of subgrade support caused by heavy traffic.

5.7.5	
Separation Layer Between DLC and Concrete Slab
The interface layer between the concrete slab and the DLC layer can be made smooth 
to reduce the inter layer friction thereby allowing relative movement between the slab and 
DLC layer and prevent reflection cracking in the pavement slab. A de-bonding interlayer of 
polythene sheet white or transparent having a minimum thickness of 125 micron is 
recommended as per the current practice in India. Wax based compound in place of plastic 
sheet has popularly been used with success in most countries including India in one of the 
National Highway projects. Bituminous concrete 2 shown in Fig. 1(b) is another option. The 
international practice on bond breaking interlayer is described in Appendix-II.
5.8	
Concrete Strength
5.8.1	
Flexural strength of concrete is required for the purpose of design of concrete 
slab. Flexural strength can be obtained after testing the concrete beam as per procedures 
given in IS: 516. Alternatively, it can be derived from the characteristic compressive strength 
of concrete as per IS 456-2000 using the following relationship:
	
	
	
Fcr = 0.7 x √fck
Where,
	
Fcr	
=	
flexural strength (modulus of rupture), MPa
	
fck	
=	
characteristic compressive cube strength of concrete, MPa
5.8.2	
Concrete mix design is usually based on 28 days strength. In the case of concrete 
pavement, 90 days strength for thickness design can be permitted in view of the fact that 



======================================================================


IRC:58-2015
13
(i) the concrete pavement is opened to traffic long after the construction (ii) the number of 
repetitions of load is very small during initial period of 90 days even if the pavement is opened 
to traffic after 28 days (iii) cumulative fatigue damage of concrete is very low during the first 90 
days and (iv) the stress analysis is done for a terminal condition of the pavement slab when 
load transfer efficiencies of transverse and tied concrete shoulder joints are low. Increasing 
the 28 days flexural strength by a factor of 1.10 may be used to get 90 days strength. In no 
case should 28 days flexural strength of pavement quality concrete be less than 4.5 MPa.
5.8.3	
Target mean flexural strength to be achieved while designing the Mix should be 
such that there is 95 percent probability that the characteristic strength would be achieved 
when the Mix is produced in the field (confidence level = 5%).
The target mean flexural strength is given by the following equation

Modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio of concrete
5.8.4.1	
The modulus of elasticity (E) and Poisson’s ratio (µ) of cement concrete vary with 
concrete materials and strength. The elastic modulus increases with increase in strength, 
and Poisson’s ratio decreases with increase in the modulus of elasticity. While it is desirable 
that the values of these parameters are ascertained experimentally for the concrete mix and 
for the materials actually to be used in the construction, this information may not always be 
available at the design stage. A 25% variation in E and µ values will have only a marginal 
effect on the flexural stresses in the pavement concrete. Following values were adopted 
for stress analysis for the concrete with 28-day flexural strength of 4.5 MPa (4.95 MPa for 
90-day strength).

Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
The coefficient of thermal expansion of concrete (α) is dependent to a great extent 
on the type of aggregates used in concrete. However, for design purpose, a value of 
α = 10 x 10-6/ºC is adopted.
5.8.6	
Fatigue Behaviour of Cement Concrete
5.8.6.1	
Due to repeated application of flexural stresses by the traffic loads, progressive 
fatigue damage takes place in the cement concrete slab in the form of gradual development 
of micro-cracks especially when ratio between the applied flexural stress and the flexural 
strength of concrete is high. This ratio is termed as Stress Ratio (SR). If the SR is less than 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:58-2015
14
0.45, the concrete is expected to sustain infinite number of repetitions. As the stress ratio 
increases, the number of load repetitions required to cause cracking decreases. The relation 
between fatigue life (N) and stress ratio is given as:
	
	
	
N = unlimited for SR < 0.45

5.8.6.2	
These fatigue criteria are used for checking the adequacy of the pavement slab 
on the basis of Miner’s hypothesis. It is assumed that the fatigue resistance not consumed 
by repetitions of one load is available for repetitions of other loads. The above fatigue criteria 
developed by Portland Cement Association (PCA, 1984) are conservative and these can be 
used for the analysis of bottom-up and top-down cracking. The validity of the PCA fatigue 
equations in the light of recent developments is discussed in Appendix III.
6  DESIGN OF SLAB THICKNESS
6.1	
Critical Stress Condition
6.1.1	
In-service cement concrete pavements are subjected to stresses due to a variety 
of factors acting simultaneously. The severest combination of different factors that induce 
the maximum stress in the pavement will give the critical stress condition. The flexural stress 
due to the simultaneous application of traffic loads and temperature differentials between 
the top and bottom fibres of a concrete slab is considered for design of pavement thickness. 
The effect of moisture change is opposite to that of temperature change and is not normally 
considered critical to thickness design. The flexural stress at the bottom layer of the concrete 
slab is the maximum during the day hours when the axle loads act midway on the pavement 
slab while there is a positive temperature gradient as illustrated in Fig. 3 and 4. This condition 
is likely to produce Bottom-Up Cracking (BUC).
Fig. 3  Axle Load Placed in the Middle of the Slab during Mid-Day
6.1.2	
Locations of points of maximum flexural stress at the bottom of the pavement slab 
without tied concrete shoulder for single, tandem and tridem axles are shown in Fig. 4. The

tyre imprints are tangential to the longitudinal edge. For tied concrete shoulders also, the 
maximum stress occurs at the same locations. Single axles cause highest stress followed 
by tandem and tridem axles respectively. Spacing between individual axles for tandem and 
tridem axles varies from 1.30 m to about 1.40 m. There is practically no difference in stresses 
for axle spacing between 1.30 m and 1.40 m. A spacing of 1.30 m has been used in these 
guidelines for stress computation.
Fig. 4  Placement of Axles for Maximum Edge Flexural Stress at Bottom of  
the Slab without Concrete Shoulders
6.1.3	
During the night hours, the top surface is cooler than the bottom surface and 
the ends of the slab curl up in a concave shape resulting in loss of support for the slab 
as shown in Fig. 5. Due to the restraint provided by the self-weight of concrete and by 
the dowel connections, temperature tensile stresses are caused at the top. Fig. 5 shows 
the placement of axle loads close to transverse joints when there is negative temperature 
gradient during night period causing high flexural stresses in the top layer leading to 
top-down cracking. Positioning of axles of different configurations on the slab with successive 
axles placed close to the transverse joints is shown in Fig. 6. These axle positions can initiate 
Top-Down Cracking (TDC) during the night hours when the pavement has the tendency 
to curl up. Built-in permanent curl induced during the curing of the concrete slab further 
aggravates the problem.

the Slab with Tied Concrete Shoulder
6.2	
Calculation of Flexural Stress
6.2.1	
Since the loads causing failure of pavements are mostly applied by single, tandem, 
tridem and other multiple axles, stresses should be determined for the conditions illustrated 
in Figs. 3 to 6. The IITRIGID software used in IRC:58-2002 for the computation of flexural 
stress in the edge region due to single and tandem axle loads was based on Picket and 
Ray (1951)’s work on computation of stresses in infinite slabs. The software is still valid for 
computation of load stress in the edge region of pavements without any concrete shoulder 
without any temperature gradient. Finite Element Method (FEM) is more appropriate for stress 
computation for a wide variety of load, temperature, geometry and boundary conditions. 
Finite element analysis has been carried out using IITSLAB-II, a software developed at IIT 
Kharagpur, to compute flexural stress due to the combined action of load (single, tandem and 
tridem axles) and different temperature differentials (positive and negative).
6.2.2	
For a single axle load of 200 kN and zero temperature differential (Fig. IV-30, 
Appendix IV), it can be seen that flexural stresses decrease with increase in k-values for all 
thicknesses. If there is a positive temperature differential of 17ºC, the same axle load causes 
higher flexural stresses in thicker slabs (Fig. IV-45) for higher k-values. For a thickness in the 
region of 270 mm, there is practically no effect of modulus of subgrade reaction on flexural 
stresses. Increasing the subgrade modulus to high values does not help in thickness design 
due to high curling stresses caused by a stiff support.
6.2.3	
The following combinations of pavements and loading were considered for the 
analysis of bottom-up and top-down cracking. For bottom-up cracking case, the combination 
of load and positive non-linear temperature differential (Fig. 3) has been considered whereas 
for top-down cracking analysis, the combination of load and negative linear temperature

differential (Fig. 5) has been taken. For bottom-up cracking analysis, single/tandem axles 
have been placed on the slab in the positions indicated in Fig. 4. In bottom-up cracking case, 
single axle load causes the largest edge stress followed by tandem and tridem axles. Since 
the stresses due to tridem axles are small, they were not considered for stress analysis for 
bottom-up cracking case. For top-down cracking analysis, the load position considered for 
analysis is as shown in Fig. 6. As indicated in the figure, only one axle of single/tandem/
tridem axle units has been considered for analysis in combination with front axle. Front axle 
weight has been assumed to be 50% of the weight of one axle of the rear axle unit (single/
tandem/tridem) for analysis.
6.2.4	
Analysis has been done for the Following Cases.
Bottom-up Cracking
	
●	
Pavement with tied concrete shoulders for single rear axle
	
●	
Pavement without concrete shoulders for single rear axle
	
●	
Pavement with tied concrete shoulders for tandem rear axle
	
●	
Pavement without concrete shoulders for tandem rear axle
Top-down Cracking
	
●	
Pavements with and without dowel bars having front steering axle with single 
tyres and the first axle of the rear axle unit (single/tandem/tridem) placed on 
the same panel as depicted in Fig. 6.
6.2.5	
For heavy traffic conditions, dowel bars are usually provided across transverse 
joints for load transfer. Tied concrete shoulders are also necessary for high volume roads. 
However, for smaller traffic volumes smaller than 450 commercial vehicles/day, tied concrete 
shoulders and dowel bars are not generally warranted. The results of the Finite Stress 
Analysis has been used for the computation of flexural stresses for pavements with and 
without (a) dowelled transverse joints and (b) tied concrete shoulders. Terminal Load Transfer 
Efficiencies (LTE) for dowelled transverse joints and tied joints between the slab and concrete 
shoulder have been taken as 50% and 40% respectively for stress computation though 
MEPDG guide (NCHRP, 2004) recommends LTE values of 60% and 50% respectively for 
dowelled and tied joints. This has been done to make design more conservative considering 
the overloading in India.
6.2.6	
The results of Finite Element Analysis of a large number of concrete pavements 
with different pavement configurations subjected to various combinations of axle loads and 
temperature differentials have been presented in the form of charts in Appendix IV. The 
slab size is taken as 3.5 m x 4.5 m. The charts can be used to obtain the edge flexural 
stress caused by a specified magnitude of single/tandem axle (positioned as indicated in 
Fig. 4) in combination with a specified positive temperature differential for a given pavement 
structure. Linear interpolation can be done for obtaining stresses for intermediate loads and 
temperatures from the charts given in Appendix IV.

6.2.7	
The finite element analysis results have been used to develop regression equations 
for estimation of the flexural tensile stress for bottom-up as well as top-down cracking cases. 
While a single regression equation was found to be adequate for estimation of flexural tensile 
stress in the slab for top-down cracking case, separate equations were developed for the 
bottom-up cases for different pavement types and foundation strengths. The regression 
equations are presented in Appendix V.
6.2.8	
Designers can develop their own excel sheets for analysis and design using the 
regression equations given in Appendix V. A programmed excel file is available with the 
guidelines in a compact disc which can be used for thickness design for different trials.
6.3	
Cumulative Fatigue Damage Analysis
6.3.1	
For a given slab thickness and other design parameters, the pavement shall be 
checked for cumulative bottom-up and top-down fatigue damages. For bottom-up cracking, 
the flexural stress at the edge due to the combined action of single or tandem rear axle 
load and positive temperature differential is considered. This stress can either be selected 
from the stress charts given in Appendix IV or by using the regression equations given in 
Appendix V. Charts explain clearly the interplay of thickness, modulus of subgrade reactions, 
axle loads and temperature differentials. Similarly, for assessing the top-down fatigue damage 
caused by repeated cycles of axle loads and negative temperature differential, flexural stress 
can be estimated using the equation given in Appendix V.
6.3.2	
The flexural stress is divided by the design flexural strength (modulus of rupture) 
of the cement concrete to obtain Stress Ratio (SR). If the Stress Ratio (SR) is less than 
0.45, the allowable number of cycles of axle load is infinity. For stress ratio values greater 
than 0.45, allowable repetitions of different axle load groups can be estimated using 
equations 5 and 6. The concrete slab undergoes fatigue damage through crack growth 
induced by repeated cycles of loading. Total cumulative fatigue damage caused to the slab 
during its service life should be equal to or less than one.
6.3.3	
Analysis indicates that contribution to CFD for bottom-up cracking is significant 
only during 10 AM to 4 PM because of higher stresses due to simultaneous action of wheel 
load and positive temperature gradient. Thus, the day hour traffic during the six hour period 
is to be considered for bottom-up cracking analysis. For the top-down cracking analysis, 
only the CFD caused during the period between 0 AM and 6 AM is significant. Hence, the 
six hourly night time traffic may be considered for computing CFD for top-down cracking 
analysis. If the exact proportions of traffic expected during the specified six-hour periods are 
not available, it may be assumed that the total night time traffic is equally distributed among 
the twelve night hours. Similarly, the total day time traffic may be assumed to be distributed 
uniformly during the twelve day hours. The Cumulative Fatigue Damage (CFD) expressions 
for bottom-up and top-down cracking cases are given by Equations 7 and 8 respectively. The 
time indicated in the equations will vary depending on the geographical location of the project 
site but the duration of each period may practically remain the same.

Design Criterion of Rigid Pavements
6.3.4.1	
If the sum of cumulative fatigue damages (i) due to wheel load and curling stresses 
at the bottom and (ii) wheel load and curling stresses at the top is less than 1, the pavement 
is safe. In other words, a pavement is deemed to have failed if sum of cumulative damages 
is greater than one.
Thus if CFD (BUC) + CFD (TDC) ≤ 1, the pavement is safe from large scale cracking.
The design thickness may be increased by 10 mm to (i) to permit two retexturing and 
(ii) grinding to rectify faulting during the service life.
6.3.4.2	
India is a large country with varied climate in different regions. The recommendations 
for six hourly traffic for fatigue analysis for day and night hours may not be valid for all regions. 
Designers are recommended to carry out hourly or two hourly fatigue damage analysis for 
all the twenty four hours to examine the safety of the pavement for which hourly temperature 
data for pavement is necessary for analysis.
6.3.4.3	
Many well designed concrete pavement display cracks within a short period of 
five years due to loss of support caused by permanent deformation and erosion of GSB and 
subgrade in the presence of water and heavy loads, locked dowel bars, shrinkage cracks 
etc. rather than fatigue cracks caused by structural deficiency. These factors deserve careful 
consideration for a satisfactory performance of pavements.
6.4	
Erosion Consideration
6.4.1	
AASHO Road Test indicated that erosion of the foundation is an important mode 
of failure in concrete pavements in addition to fatigue cracking and must be considered in 
the design and maintenance. Analysis of the AASHO road test data by Portland Cement 
Association (PCA, 1980) suggests that the erosion of the foundation was caused largely by 
tandem and multi-axle vehicles in the presence of moisture and that single axles were mostly 
responsible for fatigue cracking of slabs. Since tandem, tridem and multi-axle vehicles form 
a large percentage of the total commercial vehicles on highways in India, erosion data along 
with the condition of GSB and the subgrade need to be collected for revision of the future 
guidelines whenever there is a major rehabilitation such as panel replacement. The DLC 



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:58-2015
20
subbase recommended in the guidelines is non-erodible but very heavy commercial vehicles 
may cause erosion of granular materials and subgrade soils in the presence of water that 
might enter from median, cracks and joints. This is one of the reasons for longitudinal cracking 
along the wheel path on many highways. Record of pavement performance data including 
loss of erodible material from untreated subgrade and subbase of the concrete pavements 
will be necessary for modification of the guidelines since erosion is dependent on the quality 
of subbase and subgrade, climatic conditions as well as the gross weight of the vehicles. 
Ground Penetrating Radar or Falling Weight Deflectometer can indicate the extent the voids 
formed below a DLC layer.
6.5	
Drainage Layer
6.5.1	
New pavements are practically impermeable but with the passage of time, the 
joints, median and cracks allow the water to infiltrate into the pavement. Entrapped water 
in the subgrade and granular subbase causes erosion of the foundation material under 
dynamic loading due topulsating pore water pressure generated by moving heavy tandem 
and tridem axle loads. It may be mentioned that pavement deflection due to heavy tandem 
and tridem axles can be as high as 1.0 mm which may result in the formation of voids below 
the pavement due to the permanent deformation of the foundation material. Presence of 
excess moisture accumulated in the unbound foundation layers due to infiltration or due to 
thawing in snow-bound regions is conducive for development of permanent deformation in 
these layers being rendered soft due to excess moisture.
6.5.2	
To facilitate quick disposal of water that may enter into the subgrade, a drainage 
layer together with a separation layer may be provided beneath the DLC subbase throughout 
the road width. The separation layer prevents fines from pumping up from the subgrade to 
the drainage layer. It also provides a platform for the construction of the drainage layer. The 
amount of water infiltrating into the pavement should be assessed and a drainage layer 
having the required permeability needs to be designed. The minimum permeability of 300 m/
day or greater is recommended. It is essential to design the drainage layer appropriately for 
major highways in areas having annual rainfall in excess of 1000 mm. Local experience is the 
best guide. The drainage layer can be treated with 2 to 2.5% bitumen/cement or 2.5 to 3% 
bitumen emulsion to obtain a stable platform to permit the movement of construction traffic 
without any sideway displacement and/or shoving of the open graded aggregates. If granular 
layers are not needed because of high strength subgrade, synthetic geo-composite can be 
used for separation and drainage with a reduced thickness of levelling course of granular 
layer over the subgrade.
6.5.3	
On an examination of use of different Granular Sub Bsases (GSB) given in 
Cl 401.2.2 of MORTH Specifications 5th Revision as a drainage layer, laboratory tests indicate 
that the GSB have permeability values less than 12 metre per day which is indicative of their 
poor drainage capability and hence they are not suitable for drainage layers. Permeability 
of a number of gradations of drainage layers as per the international practice are shown in 
Appendix VI. The gradings of granular subbase of MORTH Specifications may be modified 
to correspond to one of the gradings given in Appendix VI so that a permeability of more 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:58-2015
21
than 300 m/day is obtained for high volume highways. Thickness of the drainage layer 
will depend upon the permeability as well as the quantity of infiltration of water into the 
pavement. Stabilisation with cement or bitumen emulsion to provide the necessary stability 
may be necessary for open graded drainage layer. Engineers may use their judgement about 
stabilizing the drainage layer. Laboratory tests should be done to verify that the drainage layer 
has the required permeability. A discussion on gradations parameters such as Uniformity 
coefficient, D60 and D10 parameters which control permeability of aggregates to a great extent 
is given in Appendix VI where D60 and D10 are particle sizes corresponding to 60% and 10/% 
passing and UC is the ratio of D60 and D10. Los Angeles abrasion value of the aggregates 
used for drainage layer should be less than 40% to limit degradation during compaction. 
Field tests conducted by Ridgeway (1976) in USA indicated that it is the duration of the 
rainfall rather than its intensity that is critical for infiltration of water into the pavement. It was 
found that the infiltration rate( Ic) through the joints/cracks was 0.223 m3/day/m and this value 
can be used for design of drainage layer. The infiltration rate per unit area, qi ((m3/day/m2), 
can be expressed as

6.6	
Tied Concrete Shoulder and Widened Outer Lane
6.6.1	
Tied cement concrete shoulders are recommended to protect the edge of high 
volume highway pavements. These guidelines provide for design of concrete pavements 
with tied concrete shoulders for high volume roads. Widening of outer lanes of concrete 
pavement by 0.5 m to 0.6 m can be adopted for two-lane two-way roads to reduce the 
flexural stresses in the wheel path region. Analysis of typical concrete pavements shows that 
provision of a widened outer lane functioning as a monolithic concrete shoulder reduces the 
edge flexural stress by 20 to 30%. This will result in reduction of pavement thickness. The 
total quantity of concrete may remain the same as that without shoulder. Rough texture, if 
provided to the widened part, will bring in additional safety to vehicles particularly during night 
hours. Thicknesses of pavements with widened outer lane as well as tied concrete shoulder 
are almost the same. An example of designing concrete pavements with widened outer lanes 
has been included in Appendix VII.

6.7	
Bonded Rigid Pavement
6.7.1	
A concrete pavement laid over a sustained slope on ghat sections may slip if a 
debonding layer of polythene membrane is provided between the concrete slab and Dry 
Lean Concrete (DLC). PQC may be laid directly over DLC and the monolithic action of the 
two layers can be exploited to reduce the pavement thickness. The DLC surface may be 
made rough with wire brush within 3 to 6 hours of placement and a bonding agent of water 
and cement slurry may be applied over the surface before laying of PQC. For monolithic 
pavements, transverse joints may be formed in the DLC layer also by cutting grooves to 
1/3rd of its depth exactly at the same locations where transverse joints are to be provided 
in the upper PQC layer in order to prevent random reflection cracking of upper layer due to 
cracks in the un-jointed DLC layer. This is recommended by Portland Cement association. An 
example of design of bonded rigid pavement is given in appendix VII. There is no limit on the 
strength of DLC in such cases and 7-day compressive strength of the DLC layer in bonded 
rigid pavement should not be less than 10 MPa.
6.7.2	
Finite Element can be used for design of bonded pavement. The method of 
equivalent flexural stiffness is used in the guidelines. A granular subbase of 200 mm to 
250 mm thickness may be provided below the DLC layer for bonded concrete pavement 
for separation and drainage. The effective modulus of subgrade reaction of the subgrade-
granular subbase combination can be estimated from Table 3. Total slab thickness (h) over 
the granular layer is worked out for the given traffic and other design parameters. A part of the 
PQC of thickness ‘h’ is replaced with 150 mm of DLC so that the combined flexural stiffness 
of the pavement slab layer (thickness of h1) and DLC layer (thickness of h2) is equal to or 
greater than the flexural stiffness of the slab of thickness ‘h’ over the granular layer. Flexural 
stiffness of a slab of thickness, h, is given as
	
	
	

... (10)
Where,
	
E, µ, I, h are the modulus of elasticity, Poisson’s ratio, moment of inertia and 
thickness of the slab respectively. If the design thickness of the slab considering 
slab over a granular layer and subgrade is “h”, and if it is proposed to provide a DLC 
layer of thickness “h2” bonded to the concrete slab of thickness “h1”, the thickness 
of the concrete slab (h1) can be obtained by equating the flexural stiffness of the 
design slab to the combined flexural stiffness of the DLC layer and concrete slab. 
Fig. 7 shows the bonded section with neutral axis in the pavement slab.

6.7.3	
The combined flexural stiffness of the two layers should be equal to or more 
than the requirement of design flexural stiffness given by equation 10. 28-day strength of 
DLC having a 7-day compressive strength of 10 MPa may be close to 13.6 MPa. The ‘E’ 
of DLC as per IS:456 (2000) will be about 18439 MPa (5000 (Fck)0.5). However, as thin 
DLC layer is expected to crack due to shrinkage, contraction and the construction traffic 
because of itslower tensile strength, the effective modulus of the DLC layer may be taken 
as E = 1000 x fck = 13600 MPa (AUSTROADS, 2004). Poisson’s ratio of DLC may be taken 
as 0.2.
6.8	
Anchor Beam and Terminal Slab
6.8.1	
During the hot season, the concrete slabs expand and this will result in the build-
up of horizontal thrust on dirt-wall/abutment of structures. To contain this thrust, RCC anchor 
beams are generally provided in the terminal slab. One or more expansion joints may also 
be provided to accommodate the expansion. The terminal slab, therefore, will have to be 
reinforced to strengthen it. The details of the anchor beam and terminal slab are discussed 
in IRC:15.
6.9	
Recommended Procedure for Slab Design
6.9.1	
The following steps may be followed for design. Examples of design of different 
categories of concrete pavements using the current guidelines are given in Appendix VII.
Step 1 :	
Stipulate design values for the various parameters
Step 2 :	
Select a trial design thickness of pavement slab
Step 3 :	
Compute the repetitions of axle loads of different magnitudes and different 
categories during the design life



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:58-2015
24
Step 4 :	
Find the proportions of axle load repetitions operating during the day and night 
periods
Step 5 :	
Estimate the axle load repetitions in the six-hour-period during the day time. 
The maximum temperature differential is assumed to remain constant during the 
6 hours for analysis of bottom-up cracking
Step 6 :	
Estimate the axle load repetitions in the six-hour period during the night time. 
The maximum negative temperature differential during night is taken as half of 
day-time maximum temperature differential. Built in negative temperature 
differential of 5ºC developed during the setting of the concrete is to be added 
to the temperature differential for the analysis of top-down cracking. Only those 
vehicles with spacing between the front (steering) axle and the first rear axle less 
than the transverse joint spacing need to be considered for top-down cracking 
analysis.
Step 7 :	
Compute the flexural stresses at the edge due to the single and tandem axle loads 
for the combined effect of axle loads and positive temperature differential during 
the day time. Determine the stress ratio (Flexural stress/Modulus of Rupture) 
and evaluate the Cumulative Fatigue Damage (CFD) for single and tandem axle 
loads.
Step 8 :	
Compute the maximum flexural stress in the top surface of the pavement slab 
with the front axle near the approaching transverse joint and the rear axle close 
to the following joint in the same panel under negative temperature differential. 
Determine the stress ratio and evaluate the CFD for different axle loads for the 
analysis of top-down cracking.
Step 9 :	
Sum of CFD for the BUC and TDC. If the sum is less than 1.0, the pavement slab 
is safe against fatigue cracking.
6.9.2	
The entire design process is programmed on an excel sheet and it is included 
in a CD enclosed with these guidelines. This will enable the designer to make several 
trials conveniently. The designer has to provide modulus of the subgrade reaction of the 
foundation supporting the pavement slab, 28 day strength of concrete, temperature differential; 
traffic data such as rate of traffic growth, axle load spectrum, proportion of single, tandem 
and tridem axles, proportion of trucks with wheel base less than transverse joint spacing 
(say 4.5 m). All relevant traffic and material data are inputs to the excel sheet.
6.9.3	
It is worth noting that concrete strength increases with age. The excel sheets 
provide designs by considering 90-day strength of paving concrete (The minimum 28 day 
flexural strength is taken as 4.5 MPa). Any other strength including that of high performance 
concrete can be the input. 90 day strength can safely be used because of the following 
considerations.
	
i)	
Design traffic for edge stress calculation is taken as 25% against only 2 to 
3% axles that actually move near the edge.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:58-2015
25
	
ii)	
Assumption of low terminal load transfer efficiency at transverse and 
longitudinal joints for stress calculation. Load induced flexural stress in the 
early years of pavements will only be a fraction of computed stress.
	
iii)	
The conservative assumption of highest temperature differential being 
constant for 6 hours both during the day and night hours throughout the 
design period leads to high computed CFD.
	
iv)	
Conservative recommendation of dowel bar design. There is hardly any 
gap between the concrete slabs at transverse joints due to the absence of 
expansion joints but a gap of 5 mm is assumed in the design of dowel bar.
	
v)	
The warping due moisture gradient across the depth of the concrete is 
opposite to that of the curling due to the temperature gradient and hence 
the curling caused by temperature gradient is nullified to some extent by the 
warping caused by the moisture gradient.
7  DESIGN OF JOINTS
7.1	
Spacing and Layout
7.1.1	
Great care is needed in the design and construction of joints in cement concrete 
pavements, as these are critical locations having significant effect on the pavement 
performance. The joints also need to be effectively sealed, and maintained well.
7.1.2	
Cement Concrete Pavements have different types of transverse joints given as:
	
i)	
Contraction joints
	
ii)	
Construction joints
	
iii)	
Expansion joint
	
iv)	
Longitudinal joint
7.1.3	
Contraction joints are transverse joints which relieve the tensile stresses in 
concrete pavements. The joint spacing of a concrete pavement depends upon the type of 
coarse aggregates and the average temperature fluctuation in different seasons. The spacing 
of contraction joints should be limited to 4.5 m to prevent top-down cracking during the night 
hours.
7.1.4	
Expansion joints are transverse joints to allow expansion of concrete slab due to 
rise in average temperature in summer months. These joints are difficult to maintain and they 
get filled up with dirt and other incompressible materials causing locking of the joints and 
preventing expansion of concrete slabs. They are, therefore, no longer in use except near 
permanent structure like bridges and culverts which may be damaged by the thrust of the 
expanding concrete slab due to rise in temperatures.
7.1.5	
Construction joints should, as far as possible, be placed at the location of 
contraction joints except in case of emergency when a key joint may be used.



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:58-2015
26
7.1.6	
Longitudinal joints are required in pavements of width greater than 4.5 m to allow 
for transverse contraction and warping.
7.2	
Load Transfer at Transverse Joints
7.2.1	
Load transfer to relieve part of the load stresses in edge and corner regions of 
pavement slab at transverse joints is provided by means of mild steel round dowel bars. 
In coastal and high rainfall areas, coated/corrosion resistant dowel bars are often used 
to provide long term load transfer. The coating may be zinc or lead based paint or epoxy 
coating. Dowel bars enable good riding quality to be maintained by preventing faulting at the 
joints. For general provisions in respect of dowel bars, stipulations laid down in IRC:15, may 
be followed. More dowel bars may be provided under the wheel path of heavy commercial 
vehicles in the light of past experience. Designer may use his/her discretion after a study of

7.2.2	
From the experience gained all over the world, it is found that it is only the bearing 
stress in the concrete that is responsible for the performance of dowel bars at the joints. High 
concrete bearing stress can fracture the concrete surrounding the dowel bars, leading to the 
looseness of the dowel bar and the deterioration of the load transfer system with eventual 
faulting of the slab. Larger diameter dowel bars are found to provide better performance. 
Maximum bearing stress (Fbmax) between the concrete and dowel bar is obtained from 
equation 14.

7.2.3	
The modulus of dowel support ranges from 80,000 to 4,15,000 MPa/m. A typical 
value of 415,000 MPa/m may be adopted for design since only the fourth root of the k-value 
affects the computation of β.
7.2.4	
Each dowel bar should be designed for the maximum load being transferred by it for 
the allowable bearing pressure. Equation 15, based on the expression given by the American 
Concrete Institute (ACI) Committee-225 may be used for calculation of the allowable bearing 
stress on concrete.

7.2.5	
Since the initial Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) at the transverse joint is almost 
100% and it takes a long time for the LTE to decrease with traffic repetitions, 90-day 
compressive strength can safely be used for the computation of allowable bearing stress.
7.2.6	
For heavy traffic, greater than 450 CVPD, dowels are to be provided at the 
contraction joints since aggregate inter-lock cannot be relied upon to effect load transfer 
across the joint to prevent faulting due to the repeated loading of heavy axles. Joint widths 
of 5 mm and 20 mm may be taken for stress computation in dowel bar at contraction and 
expansion joint respectively. Recommended diameter and length of dowel bars are given in 
Table 5.

Note:	 The values given are for general guidance. Field performance under heavy loading prevalent 
in India will be the most appropriate guide. Dowel bars are not satisfactory for slabs of small 
thickness and shall not be provided for slab of less than 200 mm thickness.
7.2.7	
Dowel group action : When loads are applied at a joint, a portion of the load is 
transferred to the other side of the slab through the dowel bars. If the load is near the joint of 
a pavement slab tied to a concrete shoulder, a part of the load is transferred to the shoulder 
also. The dowel bar immediately below the wheel load carries maximum amount of load 
and other dowel bars transfer progressively smaller magnitudes of loads. Repeated loading 
causes some looseness between the dowel bars and the concrete slab and recent studies 
indicate that the dowel bars within a distance of one radius of relative stiffness (1.0 l) from the 
point of load application participate in load transfer. Assuming a linear variation of the load 
carried by different dowel bars within 1.0 l, the maximum load carried by a dowel bar can be 
computed. Appendix VIII contains an example of design of dowel bar system.

8  TIE BARS FOR LONGITUDINAL JOINTS
8.1	
The longitudinal joint is expected to open up during the service period (in case of 
heavy traffic, expansive subgrades, etc.) and tie bars may be provided in accordance with 
the recommendation of IRC:15., For the sake of convenience of the designers the design 
procedure recommended in IRC:15 is given here.
8.2	
Design of Tie Bars

equation 16.
	
	
	
As = bfw


... (16)
In which,
	
As

area of steel in mm2, required per m length of joint
	
b

f

weight of slab in kN/m2 and
	
Sst	
=	
allowable working stress of steel in MPa
8.2.2	
The length of any tie bar should be at least twice that required to develop a bond 
strength equal to the working stress of the steel. The formula for estimating the length of tie 
bar is given as equation 17.
	
	
	
L =

In which:
	
L

length of tie bar (mm)
	
Sst

Pptb	 =	
perimeter of tie bar (mm), and
	
B*	
=	
permissible bond stress of concrete (i) for deformed tie bars = 2.46 MPa, 
	(ii) for plain tie bars – 1.75 MPa.
8.2.3	
Reinforced Cement Concrete needs to be provided in pavement panels in curved 
portions of radius less than 45 m and at underpasses on steep gradients, and for slabs 
having man-hole cover slab having L/B (length to breadth) ratio more than 1.5 and in other 
similar situations.
8.2.4	
To permit warping at the joint, the maximum diameter of tie bars may be limited 
to 16 mm, and to avoid concentration of tensile stress they should not be spaced more than 
750 mm apart. The calculated length, L, may be increased by 50 to 80 mm to account for any

Note:	 The recommended details are based on the following values of different design parameters: 
Sst = 125 MPa for plain bars, 200 MPa for deformed bars; bond stress for plain bars = 1.75 
MPa, for deformed bars = 2.46 MPa as per IRC:15. Tie bars deformed/plain shall conform to 
IS 1786 and IS 432 respectively.
9  REINFORCEMENT IN CONCRETE SLAB TO CONTROL CRACKING
9.1	
Jointed reinforced concrete pavement is adopted for longer slabs with transverse 
joint spacing greater than 5.0. Reinforcement in concrete pavements, is intended to hold 
the cracked faces tightly together, so as to prevent opening of the cracks and to maintain 
aggregate interlock required for load transfer. It does not increase the flexural strength of 
unbroken slab when used in quantities which are considered economical.
9.2	
Reinforcement in concrete slabs counteracts the tensile stresses caused by 
shrinkage and contraction due to temperature or moisture changes. The maximum tension 
in the steel across the crack equals the force required to overcome friction between the 
pavement and its foundation, from the crack to the nearest joint or free edge. This force is the 
greatest in the middle of the slab where the cracks occur first. Reinforcement is designed for 
this critical location. However, for practical reasons reinforcement is kept uniform throughout 
the length for short slabs.
9.3	
The amount of longitudinal and transverse steel required per m width or length of 
slab is computed by the following formula:
	
	
	
As = 

... (18)
in which
	
As	
=	
area of steel in mm2 required per m width or length of slab

Ld	
=	
distance (m) between free transverse joints (for longitudinal steel) or 
	free longitudinal joints (for transverse steel).
	
f	
=	
coefficient of friction between pavement and subbase/base (usually 
	taken as 1.5),
	
W	
=	
weight of the slab in kN/m2 and Sst = allowable working stress in steel 
	in MPa (usually taken as 50 to 60 per cent of the minimum yield stress 
	of steel)
9.4	
Since reinforcement in the concrete slabs is not intended to contribute towards 
its flexural strength, its position within the slab is not important except that it should be 
adequately protected from corrosion. Since cracks starting from the top surface are more 
critical because of ingress of water when they open up, the general preference is for the 
placing of reinforcement about 50 to 60 mm below the surface. Reinforcement is often 
continued across longitudinal joints to serve the same purpose as tie bars, but it is kept at 
least 50 mm away from the face of the transverse joints and edge. In special cases, the steel 
reinforcement shall be provided in acute curve portions, under passes, steep gradients and 
slabs having man-hole covers and slabs having length to breadth ratio more than 1.5 and at 
acute angled corners.
10  WIDENING OF CONCRETE PAVEMENTS FROM 4 LANES TO 6 LANES
10.1	
The rapid increase in traffic demands an up-gradation of existing concrete roads 
and additional lanes are to be added to accommodate the increasing traffic. In order to 
convert the existing 4-lane facility to 6-lane facility, one 3.5 m wide lane has to be added on 
each side of the pavement as illustrated in Fig. 8. The outer 1.5 m of the lane becomes part 
of the shoulder. The newly added lane should be tied to the shoulder of existing pavement. 
Tie bars can be placed by drilling holes along the longitudinal edge of shoulder of the existing 
pavement and epoxy grouting. The side faces may be chipped by mechanical equipment 
before concreting.

Appendix - I
International Practices on the use of Cemented Subbases  
for Cement Concrete Pavements
While a DLC subbase of 10 MPa, 7 day average compressive strength has been the common 
practice in India, non-availability of good quality aggregates is causing problems to road 
construction activity in India and other countries due to closure of quarries, restriction on new 
quarry sites from environmental considerations. It is worth-while to examine the international 
practice in the construction of cemented/stabilized subbases adopted in this regard. The 
subbases used for heavy-duty pavements have to be uniform and provide permanent 
support without erosion under adverse conditions of wetting and drying as well as freezing 
and thawing.
Standards and specifications adopted in different countries for subbase layer vary widely. A 
maximum of 28 day compressive strength of 8.5 MPa is recommended in US and Canada 
for heavy duty highway pavements to provide a non-erodible support. AUSTROADS (2004) 
recommends a characteristic 28 day compressive strength of 5 MPa with flyash and 7 MPa 
without flyash. Marginal as well as recycled concrete aggregates are being increasingly 
used as they are able to meet the afore-mentioned strength requirements. The cementitious 
subbases must satisfy the relevant durability criteria so that they do not erode. Loss of weight 
shall not exceed 14% after 12 cycles after wetting and drying / freezing and thawing tests 
conducted as per ASTM D559-03 (2010) and ASTM D560-03 (2010).
The revised IRC:58-2015 with reduced strength of DLC having a 7 day strength of 7MPa is 
conformity with the international practice. Marginal as well as recycled concrete aggregates 
can be used in cement treated subbase shown in Fig. 1(b) since the strength requirement is 
moderate now.

Appendix - II
International Practice on use of debonding layer  
over stabilized/cemented subbase
Concrete slabs expand and contract with temperature and moisture changes. High strength 
stabilized subbase layers have a rough texture offering high frictional restraint to the concrete 
pavement movement causing cracking at early stages when the concrete is weak. The most 
common practice has been use of two layers of wax emulsion. Choke stone has been used 
in many projects in USA as a de-bonding layer .It is a small size uniformly graded stone layer 
usually 13-25 mm thick below the PQC slab .The bond prevention quality of choke stone is 
reported to be superior to that of a wax base liquid membrane forming curing compound or 
asphalt emulsion as per experience in USA . The nominal size of aggregates in choke stone 
material is 9.5 mm. Bituminous surface dressing has also been used as a debonding layer. A 
debonding layer of dense graded Bituminous Concrete is resistant to damage by moisture and 
pavements have given better performance than other debonding layers. Nonwovenneedle-
punched geotextile fabric inter layer also is in use many countries.

Appendix - V
Regression Equations for Flexural Stress in Concrete Slab
Regressions equations are given in this Appendix for the estimation of the maximum 
tensile stress in the slab in the edge region due to the combined effect of axle loads and 
temperature differentials. The equations are included for bottom-up cracking case illustrated 
in Figs. 3 and 4 and for top-down case depicted in Figs. 5 and 6. Flexural stress for bottom-up 
cracking has been computed for non-linear positive temperature differential occurring in the 
slab during day time. The stress for top-down cracking also is due to simultaneous application 
of axle loads and linear negative temperature differential in the slab in night time.
For the computation of stress for bottom-up cracking analysis, only the rear axles (single as 
well as tandem) with two wheels (dual wheel sets) on either side of each axle have been 
considered as the front axles do not contribute to any significant fatigue damage. For top-
down cracking, rear axle is considered at one end of the pavement slab and the front axle at 
the other end. As shown in Fig. 6, only one axle of the tandem and tridem axles is assumed 
to be placed on the slab under consideration. Thus, for a tandem axle, 50% of the tandem 
axle weight is considered for analysis. For a tridem axle, 33% of the tridem axle weight may 
be taken for analysis. The corresponding front axle (see Figs. 5 and 6) is taken as 50% of 
the rear axle, (25% of rear tandem axle or one sixth of rear tridem axle loads).

Appendix - VI
Permeability of Drainable Subbase and Design of Drainage Layer
VI-I	
International Practice for Drainage Layers
A good subsurface drainage is a standard practice in all major highways in developed 
countries. A drainage layer must have enough permeability to drain away the water in 
accordance with the design criteria and must have enough stability during the construction 
Phase. Thus, the drainage layer must meet the necessary requirements for both permeability 
and stability. These requirements are at opposite ends of a materials spectrum. The more 
permeable a materials; the more unstable it will be and vice versa. Hence proper balance 
pf permeability and stability is desirable. Various gradations of aggregates for the drainage 
layer are in use due to a large variation in climate in different regions depending upon the 
local experience but most of them have high permeability. Federal Highway Administration of 
USA recommends a minimum permeability of 300 metre per day (1000 feet/day) for drainage 
layer for high volume roads with a rider that the regional experience shall govern the choice 
of the drainage materials. American Concrete Pavement Association (APCA) recommends 
a permeability of about 107 m/day for the unstabilised aggregate drainage layer below 
concrete pavements. A number of gradations for permeable drainage layers commonly used 
by different Departments of Transport in USA including those from AASHTO 93 pavement 
design guide are shown Table VI-I. Highly permeable AASHTO 57 grading of the Table is 
also used by many state highway agencies in USA. Engineers have a wide range of choice 
and any of the gradations that are available can be selected. Stabilisation is necessary for 
the stability of open graded aggregates. Conservative design for drainage layer is necessary 
to guard against pavement failure observed in India within five years of the construction due 
to deformation in GSB and the subgrade layers due to heavy loads and moisture.

As per the US practice, the concrete pavement slab is laid directly over the cement treated 
drainage layer known as permeable base and hence the stability of the drainage layer is vital 
for good performance of concrete pavement. The open graded cement treated permeable 
base is also required to stand the construction traffic. In India, a much stronger DLC layer 
bears all the construction traffic and it also provides a strong support to the pavement slab. 
Hence, any of the grading 4, 6 and 7 of Table VI-I containing relatively higher fines contents 
than the others can be used without stabilization to form to provide a proper balance between 
permeability and stability. For gradations 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8, stabilization may be necessary to 
impart stability. The aggregates for the highly permeable drainage layers are predominantly 
coarser that 4.75 mm. The filter/separation layer placed above the subgrade must prevent 
intermixing of the subgrade soil and the drainage layer by preventing entry of the subgrade 
soil into the drainage layer and should satisfy the criteria laid down in IRC:37, IRC:SP:42 and 
IRC:SP:50.

It can be seen that the effect of bitumen treatment is only marginal if open graded aggregates 
are treated with bitumen. Cement treatment also will have similar effect. The open graded 
aggregates with maximum sizes of 20 mm and 4.75 mm shown in S.N. 2 and 3 of Table VI-II 
can also have a high permeability and a thickness of 75 mm also may be sufficient to drain 
away the water. The minimum recommended thickness for the drainage layer is 100mm for 
which the maximum aggregate size should be about 40 mm.

VI-III 
Relation Between Effective Aggregate Size, Uniformity Coefficient and 
Coefficient of Permeability
It may not always be possible to determine the permeability of the drainage layer. Some 
simple well established guidelines can be used to adopt the right type of drainage layer which 
will have reasonably good permeability The permeability of a drainage layer depends to a 
great extent upon the effective aggregate size (D10) and Uniformity coefficient (Cu).
where,
	
D10	 =	
effective aggregate size mm, (corresponding to 10% finer than D10)
	
D60	 =	
particle 
size, 
mm 
(corresponding 
to 
60% 
finer 
than 
D60), 
	
Cu = D60/D10
Greater the value of D10, greater is the permeability. The value of D10 greater than 2 mm is 
adopted for highly permeable aggregates Cu = 1 for single size aggregates. Lower the value 
of Cu, greater is the permeability and but lower is the stability. Cu = 40 for dense graded 
aggregates. The Uniformity Coefficient, Cu, is an indicator of the spread of the particle sizes 
between the 10 and 60 percent particle sizes. This, in turn, is an indicator of the gradation’s 
permeability and stability:
For a good drainage layer, Cu should be between 2 and 8. If Cu is less than 4, the drainage 
layer has a high permeability but the layer is unstable and it must be stabilised with cement 
or bitumen for heavy traffic pavements.
VI-IV	
Permeability of Granular Subbase as per the MORTH
The granular subbase having as per Section 401.2.2 of MORTH have permeability values 
less than 12 m/day as per the laboratory tests and they are not suitable for drainage layers. 
Only lower gradation limits of Grades III and VI have the Cu values close to 5 and will have 
the required permeability. The gradations for good drainage layers are shown in Tables VI-I. 
Thickness of highly permeable layer can be much less if permeability is high as shown in the 
example given in the section later.
While a new concrete pavement is practically impermeable, longitudinal and transverse joints 
open up due to oxidation of the sealing material, expansion and contraction of the slabs. 
Cracks in the pavement slabs may also form due to deformation of the foundation caused by 
heavy commercial vehicles aggravated in the presence of moisture or by settlement. Water 
may thus enter into the pavements through the joints and cracks.
VI-V	
Quantum of Water Entering into Pavements
There two methods of estimation of the amount water that enters into a pavement.
	
I)	
Infiltration ratio method (Cedergrain)
	
II)	
Crack infiltration method (Ridgeway)
Certain percentage(50 to 67%)of hourly rainfall of one year frequency is assumed to enter 
into a rigid pavement in the infiltration ratio method. In the crack infiltration method, water

IRC:58-2015
79
enters through joints and cracks in the pavement. Any method can be used but widely used 
crack infiltration method of Ridgeway is adopted in the guidelines.
VI-VI	
Estimation of Permeability Requirement
The required permeability of the drainage layer can be estimated by two methods as discussed 
below.
	
I)	
In the first method, the permeability of the drainage layer is selected 
depending upon the quality of drainage selected as defined in AASHTO 93 
Pavement Design Guide. The quality of drainage is determined by the time 
required for the pavement to drain from a saturated condition. The time is 
less than two hours for an excellent drainage for a high volume pavement 
and less than one day for a good drainage (AASHTO 93).The time-to-drain 
approach is based on water entering the pavement until the permeable base 
is saturated. Excess run off will not enter the pavement section after it is 
saturated because the water will simply run off on the pavement surface. 
After the stoppage of rain , the base will drain to embankment slope or into 
the edge-drain system if provided. Engineers may select a permeability of 
the drainage layer to drain relatively quickly to prevent the pavement from 
being damaged. The quantum of water entering into the pavement can be 
estimated by infiltration ratio method or by crack infiltration method.
	
II)	
In the second method, the permeability is so selected that total outflow 
capacity of the drainage layer is be greater than the inflow of rainwater into 
the pavement. This approach has been adopted in the example given below. 
The time to drain approach also can be adopted as per the AASHTO 93 
guidelines.
VI-VII	
Water from Median
Water entering into the pavements from earthen medians may be very damaging if care is not 
taken to prevent entry of water along with fines into the drainage layer. Choking of drainage 
layer with soils entering into the drainage layer in the median side should be avoided by 
using a filter layer or nonwoven geotextile. Cares should be taken to ensure that the exposed 
drainage layer along the embankment slope is not covered with earth while rectifying the 
erosion of the side slope after the rain. Blockage of a drainage layer may cause a much serious 
problem than with no drainage layer. Several cases of drainage problems are described in 
IRC:37, IRC:42 and IRC:50.
VI-VIII	
Example of Design of a Drainage Layer
A four-lane divided cement concrete pavement will be constructed for a high traffic volume 
road in an area having an annual rainfall of 1500 mm/year. The width of each carriageway will 
be 7.0 m. 2.5 m wide shoulders (1.5 m concrete, 1.0 m unpaved) will be provided. Transverse 
joint spacing will be 4.5 m. The highway has a longitudinal gradient of 3 percent and a camber 
of 2.5 percent. Side slopes of embankment are 2:1 (horizontal to vertical). The pavement has

a 300 mm thick concrete slab placed over 150 mm thick DLC layer. Estimate the requirement 
of permeability of the drainage layer material to be used if the layer thickness is 150 mm.
Solution:
	
●	
Combined thickness of the slab and DLC layer = 300 + 150 = 450 mm.
	
●	
The drainage layer will be provided below the DLC layer at a depth of 450 
mm from pavement surface. The drainage layer will be extended to the full 
width of embankment.
	
●	
Width of drainage layer = 7 m (pavement) + 2.5 m (shoulder) + 2 x 0.45 m = 
10.4 m
	
●	
Fig. VI.1 indicates the direction of flow of water along AD (diagonal)
	
●	
In Fig. VI.1, AB = 10.4 m; AC = 10.4 x (0.03/0.025) = 12.48 m; AD = (10.42 + 
12.482)0.50 = 16.24 m
	
●	
Drop of elevation along AC = 12.48 x 0.03 = 0.374 m; Elevation drop along 
CD = 10.4 x 0.025 = 0.26 m; Elevation drop along AD = 0.374 + 0.260 = 
0.634 m
	
●	
Gradient along AD = I = drop along AD/ length of AD = 0.634/16.24 = 0.039

Dp

rate of infiltration through un-cracked pavement surface = nil( 0 m3/day/m2)
	
●	
Thus, the rate of infiltration of water into pavement, qi = 0.115 m3/day/m2
	
●	
Amount of infiltrated water per meter length flowing along the path AD of the 
drainage layer, Q = 16.24 (length of AD)* 0.115 = 1.868 m3/day per meter 
width of drainage layer along AD. Let K = coefficient of permeability (m/day), 
A = area of the drainage layer along AD per metre width
	
●	
Rate of flow through drainage layer, Q = KIA. Since I = 0.039, KA = 1.868/0.039 
= 47.89.
	
● 	
A = 1 x 0.15 = 0.15 m2 assuming depth of the drainage layer as 150 mm.
	
●	
Hence, the required coefficient of permeability, K = 47.89/0.15 = 319 m/day.
	
●	
If thickness of the drainage layer is 300 mm, the required K = 160m/day.

Appendix - VII
Illustrative Examples of Thickness Design
Example
A cement concrete pavement is to be designed for a four-lane divided National Highway with 
two lanes in each direction in the state of Bihar. Design the pavement for a period of 30 years. 
Lane width = 3.5 m; transverse joint spacing = 4.5 m.
It is expected that the road will carry, in the year of completion of construction, about 3000 
commercial vehicles per day in each direction. Axle load survey of commercial vehicles 
indicated that the percentages of front single (steering) axle, rear single axle, rear tandem 
axle and rear tridem axle are 45%, 15%, 25% and 15% respectively. The percentage of 
commercial vehicles with spacing between the front axle and the first rear axle less than 
4.5 m is 55%. Traffic count indicates that 60% of the commercial vehicles travel during night 
hours (6 PM to 6 AM).
Details of axle load spectrum of rear single, tandem and tridem axles are given in Table VII.1. 
Front (steering) axles are not included. The average number of axles per commercial vehicle 
is 2.35 (due to the presence of multi-axle vehicles).

Selection of modulus of subgrade reaction :-
	
●	
Effective CBR of compacted subgrade = 8%. Modulus of subgrade 
reaction = 50.3 MPa/m (from Table 2)
	
●	
Provide 150 mm thick granular subbase
	
●	
Provide a DLC subbase of thickness 150 mm with a minimum 7 day 
compressive strength of 7 MPa
	
●	
Effective modulus of subgrade reaction of combined foundation of 
subgrade + granular subbase and DLC subbase (from Table 4 by 
interpolation) = 285 MPa/m
	
●	
Provide a debonding layer of polythene sheet of 125 micron thickness 
between DLC and concrete slab.
	
b)	
Selection of Flexural Strength of Concrete :-
	
●	
28-day compressive strength of cement concrete ≥ 40 MPa minimum
	
●	
90-day compressive strength of cement concrete ≥ 48 MPa
	
●	
28-day Flexural strength of cement concrete = 4.5 MPa (minimum)
	
●	
90-day Flexural strength of cement concrete = 4.5 × 1.1 = 4.95 MPa

Total two-way axle load repetitions during the design period
 	
	
= 226,444,692 X 2.35 = 532,145,025 axles
	
●	
Number of axles in predominant direction = 532,145,025 X 0.5 = 
266,072,513
	
●	
Design traffic after adjusting for lateral placement of axles (25% of 
predominant direction traffic for multi-lane highways) = 266,072,513 X 
0.25 = 66,518,128
	
●	
Night time (12-hour) design axle repetitions = 66,518,128 * 0.6 (60% 
traffic during night time) = 39,910,877
	
●	
Day time (12-hour) design axle repetitions = 66,518,128 * (1-0.6) = 
26,607,251
	
●	
Day-time Six-Hour axle load repetitions = 26,607,251 / 2 = 13,303,626
	
●	
Hence, design number of axle load repetitions for bottom-up cracking 
analysis = 13,303,626
	
●	
Night-time Six-Hour axle load repetitions = 39,910,877/2 = 19,955,439
	
●	
% of commercial vehicles having the spacing between the front 
(steering) axle and the first axle of the rear axle unit less than 4.50 m = 
55%

Hence, the Six-hour night-time design axle load repetitions for Top-

for carrying out TDC analysis
Computation of bottom-up and top-down cumulative fatigue damage is illustrated in 
Tables VII.2 and VII.3. It can be seen from the calculations given in the tables that for the 
slab thickness of 0.28 m, the total fatigue damage for bottom-up and top down crcaking is 
0.976 + 0.274 + 0.445 + 0.036 = 1.731 which is greater than 1.0. Hence, the trial thickness 
of 0.28 m is not adequate. Increase thickness to 290 mm, Total CFD = 0.527, Hence 290 
mm is acceptable. If two retexturing is considered in 30 years, a thickness of 300 mm will be 
appropriate.

Pavement Option II - Concrete pavement with no concrete shoulder and without dowel bars 
across transverse joints. This is for illustration since dowel bar is essential for heavy traffic to 
prevent faulting, erosion and pumping at transverse joints.
	
●	
Trial thickness of slab, h = 0.33 m
	
●	
Radius of relative stiffness, l = (Eh3/(12k (1-µ2))0.25 = 0.75358 m
	
●	
‘Beta’ factor in the stress equations will be 0.90 for transverse joints without 
dowel bars for carrying out TDC analysis
The cumulative fatigue damage values obtained for bottom-up and top-down cracking 
analyses are given below.
Bottom-up cracking :- 	
(a) CFD due to rear single axles = 0.935
	
	
	
	
(b) CFD due to tandem axles = 0.000
	
	
	
	
(c) Total CFD = 0.935 
Top-down cracking :		
(a) CFD due to rear single axles = 0.233
	
	
	
	
(b) CFD due to tandem axles = 0.390
	
	
	
	
(c) CFD due to tridem axles = 0.030
	
	
	
	
(d) Total CFD = 0.654
Total CFD for BUC and TDC=1.589 >1,0
Hence, the trial thickness of 330 mm is not adequate. A thickness of 340 mm is needed. 
This clearly shows that for heavy traffic, dowel bar is necessary to lower CFD for TDC. This 
also illustrates that CFD for BUC is large for pavement without concrete shoulder.
Pavement Option III - Concrete pavement with widened outer lanes
The reduction of flexural stress due to widening of the outer lane by 0.5 m to 0.6 m is of the 
same order as that of providing tied concrete shoulder. Hence, the thickness of the pavement 
will be the same as that obtained for Option I (with tied concrete shoulders). Hence, design

thickness of concrete pavement slab = 290 mm. The thickness may be increased by 10 mm 
for two retexturing during the oavement’s life time.
Pavement Option IV- Concrete pavement bonded to dry lean concrete layer.
 A 7 day strength of 10 MPa or higher for the DLC is necessary for a bonded pavement. There 
is no upper strength limit for DLC for bonded cases.
	
●	
Provide a granular subbase of 250 mm thickness above the subgrade
	
●	
Effective modulus of subgrade reaction of foundation consisting of subgrade 
(8% CBR) and granular subbase (from Tables 2 and 3) = 72 MPa/m
	
●	
Assuming that doweled transverse joints and tied concrete shoulders will be 
provided, the thickness of slab required for the given traffic and other design 
data = 0.30 m.
	
●	
Referring to Fig. 6, E1 = 30000 MPa, E2 = 13600 MPa, µ1 = 0.15, µ2 = 0.20
	
●	
Provide a DLC thickness of 0.15 m. For bonded condition, DLC of of 
10 MPa strength at 7 days is considered. Higher strength DLC will give lower 
thickness of PQC slab
	
●	
Depth of neutral axis (computed using equation 11) = 0.16 m
	
●	
Assume a trial slab thickness (to be bonded to 0.15 m thick DLC layer) = 
0.235 m
	
●	
Stiffness of the slab to be placed over DLC layer (Equation 12) = 46.65 
MN.m
	
●	
Stiffness of the DLC layer (Equation 13) = 23.28 MN.m
	
●	
Combined stiffness of slab and DLC = 46.65 + 23.28 = 69.93 MN.m
	
●	
Stiffness of the design slab of 0.3 m thickness (Equation 10) = 69.05 MN.m
	
●	
Combined stiffness is more than the design stiffness requirement. Hence 
OK.

Design of Dowel Bars
Example
Input data considered for dowel bar design
●	
Slab thickness, h 	
	
	
= 330 mm
●	
Joint width, z	
	
	
	
= 20 mm (expansion joint), 5mm (for  
	
	
	
	
	
	
   contraction joint)
●	
Modulus of subgrade reaction, k	
= 80 MPa/m
●	
Radius of relative stiffness, l	 	
= 1035.3 mm
●	
E for dowel bar	 	
	
	
= 2 x 105 MPa
●	
Modulus of dowel support, kmds	
= 415000 MPa/m
●	
Maximum single axle load	
	
= 190 kN
●	
Maximum single wheel load 	 	
= 190/2 = 95 kN (considering dual wheel as 
	
	
	
	
	
	
    single wheel for a safe design)
●	
Assume a load transfer of 30% at terminal stage to the tied concrete shoulder. If 
no concrete shoulders are provided, no load transfer to shoulder may be assumed
●	
Wheel load for dowel bar design 	
= 95 x 0.7 = 66.5 kN
●	
Safety of the dowel bar is examined for a wheel load of 66.5 kN
●	
Assume the percentage of load transfer through dowel bar as 50% for 100% joint 
efficiency. The load to be transferred=33.25 kN
●	
Permissible bearing stress in concrete is calculated (using equation 15) as:-
	
	
	
Fb = (101.6 – bd) fck/95.25
Where,
	
fck	
=	
characteristics compressive	
= 40 MPa for M40 grade
	
bd	
=	
diameter of the dowel bar	 	
= 38 mm (assumed)
	
Fb	
=	
(101.6 – 38) * 40 / 95.25	
	
= 26.7 MPa
●	
Spacing between the dowel bars (assumed)	
= 300 mm
●	
First dowel bar is placed at a distance of 150 mm from the pavement edge
●	
Assumed length of the dowel bar	
	
= 500 mm
●	
Dowel bars up to a distance of 1.0 x radius of relative stiffness (l), from the point 
of load application are effective in load transfer

●	
Number of dowel bars participating in load transfer when the wheel load is just 
over the dowel bar close to the edge of the slab = 1 + l/spacing = 1 + 1035.3/300 
= 4 dowels
●	
Assuming that the load transferred by the first dowel is Pt and that the load on 
dowel bar at a distance of l from the first dowel is zero, the total load transferred 
by dowel bar system = (1+ (1035.3 -300) /1035.3 + (1035.3 – 600)/1035.3 + 
(1035.3 – 900)/035.3 ) Pt = 2.26 Pt
●	
Load carried by the outer dowel bar, Pt	
= (33.25)/2.26 = 14.71 kN
●	
Check for Bearing Stress
●	
Moment of Inertia of Dowel = π(bd)4/64 = π x (38)4/64 = 102302.0 mm4
●	
Relative stiffness of dowel bar embedded in concrete, 
	
= [415000 x 38/(1000 x 4 x 2.0 x 105 x 102302)]1/4 = 0.021 mm-1
	
 A factor of 1000 is introduced to match the units
	
Bearing stress in dowel bar Fbmax = (Pt x kmds) x (2 + βz) / (4 β3 EI)
	
	
	
= 
	
	
	
= 20.19MPa which is less than 26.7 MPa
Hence, the dowel bar spacing and diameter assumed are safe.
Even if load transfer to the tied concrete shoulder is not considered and the dual wheels with 
a wheel spacing of 310 mm each carrying a load of 45 kN is considered separately, the dowel 
bar designed as per above is safe.
There is practically little Joint opening at transverse contraction joint. 20 mm joint width is 
assumed for the expansion joint near a structure. Therefore, the dowel bar specifications 
recommended in Table 6 will always be safe for contraction joints.
