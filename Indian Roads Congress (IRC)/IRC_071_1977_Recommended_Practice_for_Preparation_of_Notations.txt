RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR PREPARATION OF
NOTATIONS
INTRODUCTION
The Bridges Committee of Indian Roads Congress in
its meet-
ing
held
in
September,
1975
took
note
of the developments in
international acceptance of a common logical
system
of
notations
and set up a Panel to recommend a system
of
notations
in
con-
formity with the same.
The following members served on the Panel
:
P.C. Bhasin
Convenor
D.T. Grover
D. Ajitha Simha
Dr. V.K. Raina
The draft standard framed by the Panel was approved
by
the
Bridges Committee in their meeting held on the
9th
to
11th May
1977 and then by the Executive Committee.
Later
it was approved
by the Council in their 90th meeting held on the 29th July 1977.
The object of issuing this Standard
is to establish the
usage
of
a logical and uniform system of notations in
all IRC
Standards
as
well as in all technical literature, design calculations
and
drawings.
Certain changes necessary may cause inconvenience
in
initial
use.
But. an immediate and rigid adherence
is recommended
to
achieve
the desired results in shortest possible time. Suggestions for improve-
ment of the Standard, arising out of practical use, are most welcome
and may be sent to the Secretary, Indian Roads Congress, Jamnagar
House, Shahjahan Road, New Delhi- 110011.
1.
SCOPE
This standard recommends the practice to be followed
in
pre-
paring symbols to be used in notation defining any aspect
of
bridge
construction.
2.
DEFINITION
Notation
is defined as a system of symbols formed in a
logical
manner to represent definitions of engineering concept, for the
pur-
pose of this standard.

CONSTRUCTION OF SYMBOLS
A symbol shall consist of
:
(i) a leading letter,
to be chosen according to 4.
(ii) a descriptive subscript, added where necessary,
to be chosen according to
5.
(iii)
indices and
signs,
where
necessary
according
to
6.
{see Appendix I
typical
notations for a
concrete beam,
Appendix II
Symbols for
unit, Appendix
III
Common
mathematical signs or symbols).
4.
LEADING LETTER
4.1.
A leading letter shall be selected from
:
(i) Roman upper case letters
(ii) Roman lower case letters
(iii) Greek lower case letters
Greek upper case letters are reserved
for
mathematics and not recom-
mended for use in notations, within the scope of this standard.
4.2.
The selection of the leading
letter
of symbol
shall
be
based on the consideration of the dimensions of the physical quantity
involved, as given hereafter.
Concepts not included
shall
comply
with the nearest appropriate category listed.
Some exceptions have been adopted in deference to traditional
practice.
These are indicated at appropriate places and
should
be
carefully noted.
Some letters are generally prohibited from use to avoid
confu-
sion.
These are indicated as VOID in Tables
1, 2 and
3.
4.2.1.
Roman uppear case letters
shall denote quantities with the following dimensions
:
(i) Force
(ii) Force times length
(iii) Area to a power
(iv) Temperature
4.2.1.1.
An exception shall be made in case of the modulus of
elasticity, the modulus of shear,
which
shall be denoted by Roman
upper case letters
i.e.
E,G.
respectively
(for
exception
regarding
optional use of L in place of 1, see Table 2).

SUBSCRIPT
5.1.
The subscript shall be formed by Roman lower case letters
or numerals or a combination of them.
Roman upper
case
letters
or Greek letters are not recommended to be used in subscript.
5.2.
Multiple subscript should be avoided as long
as there
is
little
likelihood
of
confusion.
Multiple
subscript,
when required
to be
used, may be formed by a
group
of Roman lower case letters
or numerals or by standard abbreviation of words.
When confusion
is possible, a bar may be placed over
a multi-
ple subscript or a comma (,) may be used to distinguish between two
categories of subscripts
used
together.
Tables
4, 5 and
6 give
a
detailed
description
of
the
recommended
usage
of
subscript
of
different types.
Subscripts other than those given in Tables 4. 5 and 6
shall be
used only with a clear written definition of their meanings indicated.

The symbols shall be written without a final full stop (period).
5.
When symbols for units are combined in product, the process of com-
bination shall be indicated as below:
N.m

When combined in a quotient,
the process
of combination
shall be
indicated as below:

but not as kgnr 3
Not more than one solidus (/) shall be included in such combinations;
parentheses or preferably negative powers
shall be used where neces-
sary.
