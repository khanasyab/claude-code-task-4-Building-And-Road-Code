GUIDELINES FOR STRENGTHENING OF
FLEXIBLE ROAD PAVEMENTS USING
BENKELMAN BEAM DEFLECTION
TECHNIQUE
1. INTRODUCTION
A.C.
Benkclman
devised
the simple deflection beam
in
1953
for
measurement of pavement surface deflection on the WASHO Test Road.
It is widely
used all over the World for evaluation of the requirements of strengthening of flexible
pavements. Deflection beam
has been
in
use
in
India
for more than two decades
by different
organizations.
To
lay down a
uniform procedure
for the design of
flexible overlays
using
the Benkelman Beam
deflection
technique,
tentative
guidelines were published by the Indian Roads Congress under the title "Tentative
Guidelines for Strengthening of Flexible Road Pavements Using Benkelman Beam
Deflection Technique"
IRC:81-1981.
The tentative guidelines (IRC:81- 1981) has been in use since then and based
on
their application in practice for design of overlays
for flexible pavements, a lot of
useful data have been collected and valuable experience gained. A research study
entitled "Development of Methods such as Benkelman Beam Deflection Method for
Evaluation
of Structural Capacity of Existing Flexible Pavements and also
for
Estimation and Design of Overlays for Strengthening
of any Weak Pavement" was
also undertaken to collect
data
on
pavement
deflection
values
before and after
overlaying and various other parameters like temperature, subgrade
soil type and
moisture and their influence on pavement deflection and service behaviour.
Based
on the findings of this study and
the experience gained over the years with the use
of deflection
method
and other studies carried out in the counu-y, the Flexible
Pavement Committee prepared revised draft guidelines which were discussed by the
Highways Specifications and Standards Committee during
the meeting held on 12th
May, 1994. The HSS Committee referred
this draft back to the newly constituted
Flexible Pavement Committee
for in depth study.

2. SCOPE
2.1.
These guidelines are meant for evaluating the strengthening requirement of
existing flexible road pavements using the Benkelman Beam
Deflection Technique.
The recommendations are based on the findings of MOST Research study (R-6) and
work done at various academic and research institutions in the country as well as
the
field experience gained over the years in addition to the findings from abroad which
are relevant to Indian conditions.
2.2.
The guidelines may require revision from time to time in the light of future
experience and developments in the field. Towards this end,
it is suggested to all the
organisations intending to use the guidelines to keep a detailed tabulated record of
periodical
deflection measurements (both before and after strengthening),
type and
thickness of overlay provided, performance, traffic, climatic conditions, etc.
3.
BASIC
PRINCIPLES OF DEFLECTION
METHOD
3.1 .
Performance of flexible pavements is closely related to the elastic deflection
of pavement under the wheel loads. The deformation
or
elastic
deflection
under
a
given load depends upon subgradc
soil
type,
its moisture content and compaction,
the thickness
and
quality
of the pavement courses, drainage conditions, pavement
surface temperature etc.
3.2.
Pavement deflection is measured by the Benkelman Beam which consists of
a slender beam 3.66 m long pivoted at a distance of 2.44 m from
the tip (see Fig.l).
By suitably placing the probe between
the
dual
wheels
of
a loaded truck,
it is
possible to measure the rebound and residual deflections of the pavement structure.
While
the
rebound
deflection
is the one related to pavement
performance, the
residual deflection may be due to non- recoverable
deflection
of the pavement or
because of the influence of the deflection bowl on the front legs of the beam. Rebound
deflection
is used for overlay design. Para 4.3 discusses the method
of
deflection
measurement mdAnnexure-I gives the measuremeiit procedure.
4. PROCEDURE FOR DEFLECTION SURVEY
4.1.
General
The deflection survey essentially consists of two operations:
(i) condition
survey for collecting the basic information of the road structure and based on this, the
demarcation of the road
into
sections
of more or less equal performance; and
(ii)
actual deflection measurements.

Pavement Condition Survey
4.2.1.
This
phase
of
operation, which
shall precede
the
actual deflection
measurement, consists primarily of visual observations supplemented by simple
measjrjments for rut-depth using a 3 metre straight edge. Based on these, the road
length shall be classified
into
sections of equal performance in accordance witii the
criteria given in Table 1.
Table 1
Criteria for Classification of Pavement Sections
Classification
Pavement condition
Good
No cracking, rutting less than 10 mm
Fair
No cracking or cracking confined to single
crack in the wheel track with rutting between
10 mm
and 20 mm
Poor
Extensive cracking and/or rutting greater than 20 mm.
Sections with cracking exceeding 20 per cent shall be
treated as failed.

======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:8 1-1997
4.2.2.
As
it
is inexpedient to modify the overlay design at frequent
intervals,
it
will be preferable if the length of each section
is kept at a minimum of
1 km except
in the case of localised failure or other situations requiring closer examination where
minimum
length of section may be suitably fixed.
4.2.3.
The data collected during the condition survey shall be recorded as per
in:
Proforma given
in Table 2.
In case the pavement shows
severe
distress
or
sign^
of premature failure further investigations would be necessary to ascertain the causes
and design remedial measures.
4.3.
Deflection Measurements
4.3.1.
In each road section of uniform performance (see para 4.2) minimum of ten
points should be marked at equal distance in each lane
of
traffic
for
making the
deflection observations
in the outer
wheel
path. The interval between the points
should not be more than 50 m. On roads having more than one lane, the points marked
on
adjacent lanes should be staggered. In the D*ansverse direction,
the measurement
points should be 60 cm from the pavement edge if the lane width is less than 3.5 m and
90 cm when the lane width
is more than 3.5 m. For divided four lane highway, the
measurement points should be 1.5 m from the pavement edge.
4.3.2.
Variability
of
deflections
in a given section should be considered
for
detecting
spots where extra deflection measurements have to be made. For this
purpose, highest and lowest values in a group of ten should be compared with mean
value. If the highest or
lowest values differ from the mean by more than one- third
of mean then extra deflection measurements should be made at 25 m on either side
of point where high or low values are observed.
4.3.3.
For
measuring pavement deflection the C.G.R.A. procedure (vide
details
given
in A /i/iexiire-i) which is based on testing under
static load may be adopted.
In this method, a standard truck having a rear axle weighing 8170 kg fitted with dual
tyre inflated
to a pressure of 5.60 kg/cm
is used for loading the pavement. During
actual tests, the total load and the tyre pressure are maintained within a tolerance of
+/-
1 per cent and +/- 5 per cen' respectively.
4.3.4.
Before starting the deflection measurements, the Benkelman Beam
should
be calibrated to ensure that the dial gauge and beam are working correctly. This can
be done by using the simple procedure described below:
The beam is placed and levelled on a hard
level
ground. A
number
of
metallic blocks of different thickness
(measured accurately with a precision

micrometer) with perfectly plane faces are placed under the probe and the dial gauge
reading recorded each time. If the beam is in order, the dial gauge on the beam should
read one half the thickness of the metallic block on which the probe was placed.
Otherwise, the dial gauge
should
be
checked and replaced if necessary. If the dial
gauge
is functioning correctly, the beam pivot should be checked for free and smooth
operation, secondly the striking plate beneath the dial gauge spindle should be checked
to ensure that it is tightly secured and has not become grooved by the dial gauge stylus.
4.3.5.
Deflections
measured by
the Benkclman Beam
arc influenced by
the
pavement temperature. For design purposes, therefore, all deflection
values
should
be
related
to a common temperature.
Measurements made when the pavement
temperature is different than standard temperature would need
to be corrected. The
standard temperature and
the procedure
for correction are discussed in para 4.4.
4.3.6.
Pavement
deflections are also affected by seasonal variations
in climate.
For the purpose of applying these guidelines,
it
is intended
that the pavement
deflections should pertain to the period when the subgrade is at its weakest condition.
In India, this period occurs during the recession of monsoon. It is, therefore, desirable
to
conduct
deflection
measurements during
this period. Where the same is not
feasible, a correction factor should be applied, vide para 4.5.
4.3.7.
The deflection measurements, pavement temperature, subgrade
soil
&
deflection, and
other information collected during the deflection
study
should be
recorded in the proforma given in Tabic 3.
4.4.
Correction for Temperature Variations
4.4. 1.
The stiffness of bituminous layers changes with temperature of the binder and
consequently the surface deflections of a given pavement
will
vary
depending on
the
temperature
of
the constituent bituminous
layers. For purposes of design^
therefore,
it
is
necessary that the measured deflections be corrected to a common
standard temperature. For areas in the counU7 having yu-opical climate, the standard
temperature
is recommended
to be 35°C
(also
see
para 4.4.4.). Correction for,
temperature is not applicable
in
the case of roads with thin bituminous surfacin
(such as premix carpet or surface dressing over a non-bituminous base) since these
are usually unaffected by changes in temperatures. But temperature correction will
be required for pavements having a substantial thickness of bituminous construction
(i.e. minimum 40 m). Correction need not however, be applied in the latter case if the
road is subject to severe cracking or the bituminous layer
is substantially stripped.

+.4.2.
Available
information
shows that the deflection-pavement temperature
relationship
is linear above a temperature of 30°C. For convenience in the application
of the temperature correction,
it
is recommended
that the deflection measurements
should be taken when the pavement temperature is within the range of 30*^0 - 35°C,
preferably when the temperature is uniform and is near the standard temperature of
35^'C.
Accordingly,
as
far
as possible
deflection measurements
should be made
during morning and evening hours on summer months.

4.4.3.
Correction
lor temperature
variation on deflection
values measured
at
pavement temperature other than 35°C should be 0.01 mm
for
each
degree
centigrade change
from
the
standard lemperature of 35^C. The correction will be
positive
for pavement temperature lower than 35^C and
negative
for pavement
temperature higher than 35^C.
For example,
if the deflection
is measured
at a
pavement temperature of 37°C, the correction factor will be 0.02 mm (=2 x .01) which
should be subtracted from the measured deflection
to
obtain
the
corrected
value
corresponding to standard pavement temperature of 35"C.
4.4.4.
In colder areas, and areas of altitude greater than 1000m where the average
day temperature
is less than 20^C for more than 4
months
in
a
year, the standard
temperature of 35°C will not apply.
In
the
absence
of
adequate
data
about
deflection- performance
relationship,
it
is recommended
that
the
deflection
measurements
in

greater than

4.4.5.
In
cases
where temperature correction
is
to be applied, the pavenient
temperature should be measured during the deflection survey.
The measurement
should be made at a depth of 40 mm using a suitable short-stem mercury or a digital
contact thermometer. For this purpose, a hole of about 45 mm deep and about 10
mm diameter should be
drilled
in
the pavement and
filled with glycerol and
temperature can then be recorded after about 5 minutes.
4.5.
Correction for Seasonal Variation
4.5.1.
Since the pavement deflection
is dependent upon change in the
climatic
season of the year, it is always desirable to take deflection measurements during the
season when the pavement is in
its
weakest
condition. Since, in India, this period
occurs soon after monsoon, deflection measurements should be confined to this period
as
far as possible. When deflections are measured during the dry months, they will
require a correction factor which is defined
as the ratio of the maximum deflection
immediately after monsoon to that of the minimum deflection in the dry months.
4.5.2.
Correction for seasonal variation shall depend on type of subgrade
soil,
its
field moisture content (at the time of deflection survey) and average annual rainfall
in the area.
For this
purpose,
subgrade soils have been divided into three broad
caiegories, namely sandy/gravelly, clayey with low plasticity (PI < 15) and clayey
with
high
plasticity (PI >
15).
Similarly, rainfall
has
been divided into two
categories, namely low rainfall (annual rainfall <
1300 mm) and high rainfall (annual
rainfall >1300
mm).
Moisture correction factors (or seasonal correction
factors)
shall be obtained from Figs. 2 to 7 for given field moisture content, type of subgrade
soil and annual rainfall.
4.5.3.
The soil sample for determination of subgrade type and
its field
moisture
content shall be scooped from below the pavement as shown in Fig. 8. For this purpose
a test pit at the shoulder (adjacent to pavement edge) shall be dug to a depth upto 15
cm below
the
subgrade
level
in
every kilometer depending on the uniformity
of
subgrade
soil,
topography of the area and road profile, A soil sample of weight not
less than 100 gm should be collected using an auger from the subgrade underneath the
deflection observation points i.e. 0.6 m and 0.9 m from the pavement edge for single
and two lane pavements respectively at a depth of 50 mm
to \00 mm below the
subgrade level as shown in Fig.8. The subgrade soil shall be tested as per IS-2720 -
for type of subgrade soil, plasticity index and fleld moisture content.
The
test
pit
shall
be
made good immediately after taking soil sample and study of pavement
composition.

values of seasonal correction factors to obtain corrected values of deflection.
5. TRAFFIC
Traffic
in
terms
of
million
standard
axle
shall
be considered for the
design of overlay. If sufficient data are available at the stretch with respect to the wheel
load distribution of commercial vehicles or the vehicle damage factor and
their
transverse placement, the cumulative standard axles may be worked out based on actual
data, otherwise design traffic may be calculated as per the procedure given in IRC:37
and para 5.4 below.
5.1.
General
For
purposes
of
the design, only the number of commercial vehicles
of
laden
weight of 3
tonnes or more and their axle loading
will be considered. The
traffic is considered in both directions in the case of two lane road and in the direction
of heavier traffic in the case of multi lane divided highways.
To obtain a
realistic estimate of design
traffic due consideration should
be given to the existing traffic, possible changes
in
road network and
land use of
the area served, the probable growth of traffic and design life.

Estimate
of
the
initial daily average
traffic flow
for any road
should
normally
be
based
on
7-day
24-hoiirs classified
traffic counts. However,
in
exceptional cases where this information is not available 3-day count could be used.
5.2.
Traffic growth rate
An estimate of likely growth
rate can be obtained as follows:
a)
By studying the past trend in traffic growth.
b)
Elasticity of transport demand.
c)
If
adequate data
is not available,
it is recommended that an
average
value of
7.5 per cent may be adopted for roads in
rural routes.
5.3.
Design life
It
is recommended that the design
life for strengthening of major
roads
should be
atleast 10 years. Less important roads may, however, be designed
for a
'
shorter design period but not less than 5 years in any case.
5.4.
Computation of design traffic
5.4.1.
The
design
traffic
is considered in terms of the cumulative
number
of
standard axles to be carried during the design life
of
the
road.
Its
computation
involves estimates of the
initial
volume of commercial vehicles per day, lateral
distribution of traffic, the growth rate, the design life in years and the vehicle damage
factor (number of standard axle per commercial vehicle)
to convert commercial
vehicles to standard axles.

5.4.2.
Distribution of commercial traffic over the carriageway
A realistic assessment of distribution of commercial traffic by direction and
by lane is necessary as
it directly affects the total
equivalent
standard
axle
load
applications used in the design.
It
is recommended that for the time being the
following distribution
may
be assumed
for design
until more reliable data on
placement of commercial vehicles on the carriageway lanes are available. However
if in
a
particular
situation
a
better estimate of the distribution of u-affic between
the carriageway lanes
is available from
u-affic surveys, the same should be adopted
and the design
is based on the u-affic in the most heavily u-afficked lane. The design
will normally be applied over the whole carriageway width.
(i)
Single-lane roads (3.75 m width)
Traffic tends
to be more channelised on single lane roads than on two
lane roads and to allow for this concentration of wheel load repetitions,
the design should be based on the total number of commercial vehicles
per day
in both directions multiplied by two.
(ii) Two-lane single carriageway roads
The
design
should be
based on
75 per cent of the total number of
commercial vehicles in both directions.
(iii) Four-lane single carriageway roads
The
design
should
be
based
on 40 per cent of the total number of
commercial vehicles in both directions.
(iv) Dual carriageway roads
The
design
of dual two
lane carriageway roads should be
based on
75 per cent ofthe number ofcommercial vehicles in each direction. The
disu-ibution factor shall be reduced by 20 per cent for each additional
lane.
Ex: For dual three-lane carriageway distribution factor - 60 per cent
The
traffic in each direction may be assumed to be half the sum
in
both
directions when the
latter only is known. Where significant difference between die
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:81-1997
two streams can occur, the condition
in
the more heavily trafficked lane should be
considered
for design. However, if on a particular situation a better estimate of the
distribution of traffic between the carriageway lanes
is
available
from
traffic
surveys, the same should be adopted and the design is based on the traffic in the most
heavily
traffic lane. The design will normally be applied over the whole carriageway
width.
5.4.3.
Vehicle damage factor
The vehicle damage factor (VDF) is a multiplier for converting
the number
of commercial vehicles of different axle loads to the number of standard axle-load
repetitions. The vehicle damage factor
is
arrived
at
from
axle-load
surveys on
typical road sections so as
to cover various influencing factors such as traffic mix,
type of transportation, type of commodities carried, time
of the year, terrain, road
condition and degree of enforcement. The AASHO
axle
load equivalence factors
may be used for converting
the
axle
load
spectrum
to an equivalent number of
standard axles. For designing a strengthening layer on an existing road pavement, the
vehicle damage factor should be arrived at carefully by using
the relevant available
data or carrying out specific
axle load
surveys depending upon importance of the
project. Some surveys have been carried out in the country on National Highways,
State Highways and MDR's
which reveal excessive overloadng of commercial
vehicles. The designer should take the exact value of VDF after conducting the axle
load survey particularly
in the case of major projects. Where sufficient information
on axle load is not available, the tentative indicative values of vehicle damage factor
as given in Table 4 may be used.

6. ANALYSIS OFBATA FOR OVERLAY DESIGN

Characteristic Deflection
6.1.1.
Overlay design
for a given
section
is based not on individual deflection
values but on a statistical analysis of all the measurements
in
the
section corrected
for temperature and seasonal
variations.
This
involves calculation of mean
deflection,
standard
deviation
and
characteristic
deflection.
The characteristic
deflection
for design purposes shall be taken as given
in equations
(4) and (5). The
formulae to be used in the calculation are as follows:

7.3.
The
design traffic in terms of cumulative standard number of axles will be
computed as per the procedure described in Para 5.
7.4.
The
thickness deduced
from Fig. 9 is the overlay thickness in
terms
of
bituminous macadam
construction.
In case other compositions
are
to be
laid for
strengthening, the equivalent overlay
thickness
to be provided may be determined
using appropriate equivalency factors as suggested below
:
1 cm of Bituminous macadam
=
1 .5 cm of WBMAVet Mix Macadam/BUSG
1 cm of Bituminous macadam
= 0.7 cm of DBM/AC/SDC
7.5.
From
structural
considerations,
the recommended minimum bituminous
overlay thickness is 50 mm bituminous macadam with an additional surfacing course
of 50 mm DEM or 40 mm bituminous concrete.
7.6.
Where structural deficiency
is not indicated from deflection values,
diin
surfacing may be provided to improve the riding quality as required.
7.7.
The type of material to be used in overlay construction will depend on several
factors such as the importance of the road, the design
traffic,
the
thickness and
condition of existing bituminous
surfacing, construction convenience and relative
economics.
For heavily trafficked roads, it will be desirable to provide
bituminous
overlays. The thickness of wearing course should be in conformity with IRC:37.
7.8.
Before implementing the overlay, the existing surface shall be corrected and
brought to proper profile by filling the cracks, pot
holes,
ruts and undulations. No
part of the overlay design
thickness
shall be
used
for correcting
the surface
irregularities.
