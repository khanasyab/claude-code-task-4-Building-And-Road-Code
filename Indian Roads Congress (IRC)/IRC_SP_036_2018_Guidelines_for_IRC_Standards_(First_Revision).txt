Specification: Specifications is a document that defines a set of requirements to be satisfied 
by Material, Design, Executed work. It is mandatory in nature and no references are given in 
support of any recommendation.
Standard: A Standard is an established norm or requirement in regard to roads and bridges. It 
is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, 
processes and practices. As per the site requirement, there may or may not be deviation from 
Standards.

of Road/Bridge Projects. The Code deals with various aspects of Construction of Road/Bridge 
Projects, like Materials, Equipment, Proportioning of Materials, Measurement, Handling of 
Material, Mixing, Subgrade & Subbase preparation, Formwork, Joints, Reinforcement of Concrete, 
Placing, Finishing, Curing, Evaluation for Acceptance criteria etc. The Code incorporates latest

Pre-construction Activities, various Design and Construction aspects etc. It is non- mandatory in 
nature.
Tentative Guidelines: Tentative Guidelines are issued where intention is to have implementation 
of Project on trial basis.
State of Art Report: Total Scientific or Technical knowledge currently available and as applied to 
any aspect of Design, Construction, Maintenance or Instrumentation of Road and Bridge Project. 
SOAR is a compilation of literature survey on a subject. What is the objective, what is to be done, 
how is to be done and what equipment/instruments are required to perform, are in the scope. The 
literature referencing is given wherever required. For illustration/explanation of technical issues, 
case studies are given.  References to the related literature are given.  The recommendations/ 
explanation to the technical issues covered in SOAR are non-mandatory in nature.
General:
	
i)	
The provision of all Codes and Documents should not be in conflict.
	
ii)	
All definitions should be included in the basic Code of Road, Bridges, Traffic 
etc. Other Codes and Documents will have additional definitions relevant to that 
Document.  In case, there is any comment on any definition, it should be referred 
to the respective Committees.
	
iii)	
Specifications and Code of Practice have priority over Manuals and 
Guidelines.
10. PARAGRAPHING AND NUMBERING
For uniformity, the text of a document shall be numbered as per Indian numerals. 
For the purpose of numbering, the document shall have the following divisions:
	
i)	
Item: A major subdivision of the subject matter of the document. Items of a 
document shall be numbered in consecutive order.
	
ii)	
Clause: A subdivision of the item. Clauses shall be numbered and shall contain 
two numbers separated by a full stop. The first number being the number of the 
Item and the second being that of the Clause numbered in consecutive order.
	
iii)	
Sub-Clause: Sub-clause shall be numbered and shall contain three numbers 
separated by full stops. The first two numbers being those of Item and Clause 
respectively, and the last one being that of the Sub-clause numbered in 
consecutive order.



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 18
======================================================================
IRC:SP:36-2018
7
	
iv)	
Sub-Subclause: A subdivision under a Sub-clause shall contain four 
numbers separated by full stops. The first three numbers being those of 
the Item, Clause and Sub-clause respectively and last one being that of the 
Sub-subclause numbered in consecutive order.
In numbering Items, Clauses, Sub-clauses and Sub-subclauses, care shall be taken that ideas 
having same status are numbered at the same level and that a given idea is not split up into too 
many unnecessary Sub-clauses and Sub-subclauses.
11. APPENDICES
Any matter such as description of a lengthy test method, discussion of any of the requirements 
of the document or its basis not included in Clauses and any other matter, which is not suitable 
for the test of the document but is of general interest or assistance in the use of document shall 
be given as an Appendix.
Immediately under the Appendix designation, reference to the relevant Clause or Clauses of the 
document shall be given in brackets, followed by the title of the Appendix.
12. TABLES AND FIGURES
Tables are invariably used eliminating repetition or represent relationships clearly. Tables may 
be formal or informal type. The formal type shall be used where large amount of data is to be 
presented and which is more likely to be mentioned as a separate unit or referred to elsewhere 
in the text. The informal type should be used where a lesser amount of  information is presented 
as an integral part of the text.
Wherever the contents of the Tables/Figures are taken from a previously published document 
of IRC or others, the source shall be invariably given and necessary permission obtained, if 
necessary.
Title shall be placed at the top of all formal Tables which shall be numbered in numerals 
chapterwise. Initial letter of all principal words in the caption of the Table shall be in capitals.
All the item shall be divided in sequential manner to maintain the continuity and flow of the 
matter. The repetition of text or cross-referencing shall be followed religiously.
As a general rule, the Table shall be placed as near the first reference to it as possible without 
breaking it into the middle of the paragraph.



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 18
======================================================================
IRC:SP:36-2018

In general, footnote to the Tables should be avoided. Where it is necessary to use footnote to 
formal Tables, they shall be in smaller type placed immediately below the Table. To indicate 
reference to footnote, the use of asterisks, daggers, another small symbol should be made. 
However, where there is a large number of footnotes to a Table, superscript numerals in one 
consecutive series may be used.
13. ILLUSTRATIONS
Diagrams, Maps, Graphs, Photographs, Animations and Drawings in perspective isometric or in 
third angle projection shall be used wherever it is required to illustrate  the text more precisely 
and candidly. All the drawing shall be made with appropriate tool like Autocad/ else. These 
shall be referred to as Figures.
Diagrams: The text for the Standard is printed in 12 point size type (nearly 1.5 mm in height); 
therefore, the written matter in Diagrams should be so made that the size of the letter when 
reduced for reproduction should be about 1.5 mm. If a Diagram is to be reduced to one quarter 
of its size, the lettering on it should not be less than 6 mm in height.
All the illustrations shall be well accommodated within the margins evenly. Single illustration 
shall be placed at the centre. 
All illustrations in a given document shall be designated as Figures and consecutively numbered. 
Grouping of Figures as 1-A, B shall be avoided to extent where a Figure illustrates a number of 
parts relating to the same object. Title shall be placed at the bottom of Figures. The initial letter 
of all the principal words shall be in capitals. All Graphs and Photos shall be coloured wherever 
is possible.
Each Figure shall be placed as near the reference to it in the text as possible without needlessly 
breaking into the middle of a paragraph. Necessity for turning over a page to refer to Figure shall 
be avoided.
14. UNITS OF MEASURE
SI units shall be used in all the documents.
15. TERMINOLOGY
The definitions/glossary of terms used in the document shall be given invariably in all the 
document. The terms should be consistent with other documents of Indian Roads Congress 
(IRC) or Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) including International Standard.
As far as possible, alphabetic order shall be adopted.
