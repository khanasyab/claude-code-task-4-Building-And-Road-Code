GUIDELINES  FOR  WET  MIX  MACADAM
1  INTRODUCTION
The Indian Roads Congress published the Guidelines for Wet Mix Macadam in 1997. This 
document served the profession well for about two decade. Taking note of the technological 
development and performance experience, the Flexible Pavement Committee (H-2) felt the 
necessity for the revision of the document. The initial revised draft guidelines were prepared 
by Shri Bidur Kant Jha and thereafter brought into shape by the Sub-Group comprising 
Shri A.V. Sinha, Dr. Sunil Bose, Shri S.K. Nirmal, Shri R.K. Pandey and Shri Kaushik Basu. 
The draft of the said Guidelines was discussed in various meetings. The H-2 Committee 
finalized the draft in its meeting held on 07.06.2014.

The finalized revised guidelines were approved by the Highways Specifications and Standards 
Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 9th August, 2014. The document was approved by the 
Executive Committee in its meeting held on 18th August, 2014. The IRC Council in its meeting 
held at New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2014 approved the draft IRC:109 “Guidelines for 
Wet Mix Macadam” (First Revision) for publishing.
2  DESCRIPTION
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) construction is an improvement upon the conventional WBM and 
is intended to be as an alternative and more durable pavement layer.
Wet Mix Macadam is a sub-base/base course of the pavement wherein clean, crushed graded 
aggregates and granular material, like, graded coarse sand are mixed with water and rolled 
to a dense mass on a prepared surface. The work may be done in layers. The thickness of 
an individual layer shall not be less than 75 mm and can be upto 250 mm.
3  MATERIALS
3.1	
Aggregate
3.1.1	
Physical Requirements
Coarse aggregates shall be crushed stone/crushed gravel/shingle, not less than 90 percent 
by weight of gravel/shingle retained on 4.75 mm sieve shall have at least two fractured faces. 
The aggregates shall conform to the physical requirements set forth in Table 1.
If the water absorption value of the coarse aggregates is greater than 2 percent, soundness 
test shall be carried out on the material as per IS:2386 (Part V) with sodium sulphate which 
should not exceed 12 percent.

** To determine the combined proportion of flaky and elongated particles, the flaky stone from 
a representative sample should first be separated out. Flakiness index is weight of flaky stone 
divided by weight of stone sample. Only the elongated particles be	separated out from the 
remaining (non-flaky) stone metal. Elongation index is weight of elongated particles divided 
by total non-flaky particles. The value of flakiness index and elongation index so found are 
added up.
3.1.2	
Grading Requirements
Materials shall have particle size distribution and particle shape which provide high mechanical 
stability and should contain sufficient fines to produce a dense material when compacted. 
If the amount of fine aggregate produced during the crushing operation is insufficient, non-
plastic angular sand may be used to make up the deficiency. In constructing a crushed stone 
road base, the aim should be to achieve maximum impermeability compatible with good 
compaction and high stability under traffic.
The aggregates shall conform to the grading given in Table 2.

* The fraction passing the 75 micron sieve shall not be greater than two-thirds of the fraction 
passing the 600 micron sieve.
The grading of the WMM shall be within and approximately parallel to the grading envelope. 
The grading within the limit set forth in Table 2 shall be graded from coarse to fine and shall 
not vary from the low limit on one sieve to the high limit on the adjacent sieve or the vice 
versa. The grading can be produced by crushing rock and may be an all-in product, usually 
termed a ‘crusher-run’. If it is unable to achieve the required grading directly and continuously 
from crushing, screen the material into at least four fractions and reconstitute the material to 
conform to the Specifications by mixing it together in a pug mill.
Material finer than 425 micron shall have Plasticity Index (PI) not exceeding 6. For determination 
of laboratory MDD/OMC, for sample having aggregate passing through 37.5 mm sieve, bigger 
size mould of volume 2250 cc as specified in IS:2720, (Part VIII) shall be used.
4  CONSTRUCTION  OPERATIONS
4.1	
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
The work of laying of wet mix macadam shall not be done during rain.
4.2	
Preparation of the Sub-base/base
The surface of the sub-base/base to receive the WMM course shall be prepared to the 
specified lines and cross-fall (camber) and made free of dust and other extraneous matter.

Any ruts or soft yielding places shall be corrected in an approved manner and rolled until 
firm surface is obtained, if necessary by sprinkling water. Laying of WMM over an existing 
bituminous surface is not permitted.
4.3 
Provision of Lateral Confinement of Wet Mix Layer
While constructing WMM, arrangement shall be made for the lateral confinement of wet 
mix. This shall be done by laying materials of adjoining shoulders along with that of wet 
mix layer. The sequence of operations shall be such that the construction of the shoulder 
is done in layers each matching the thickness of the adjoining pavement layer. Only after a 
layer of pavement and corresponding layers in shoulder have been laid and compacted, the 
construction of the next layer of pavement and shoulder shall be taken up.
4.4	
Preparation of Mix
When the WMM mix is the crusher run material, it shall be stockpiled with the front end loader. 
Before sending the mix for laying, the stockpile shall be watered and homogeneously mixed 
and loaded to the tipper/dumper. In other case WMM shall be prepared in an approved mixing 
plant of suitable capacity conforming to requirements detailed in Annexure. In exceptional 
cases, for small quantity of wet mix work, mixing may be done in ordinary concrete mixer.
Optimum moisture for mixing shall be the laboratory OMC. While adding water, due allowance 
should be made for evaporation losses. However, at the time of compaction, water in the wet 
mix should not vary by more than ± 2 percent.
4.5	
Spreading of Mix
Immediately after mixing, the mixed material shall be transported to site and spread uniformly 
and evenly upon the prepared sub-base/base in required quantities. Hauling of the mix over 
a freshly completed stretch is not permitted. Transportation of mix is usually done by tipping 
trucks. In order to avoid moisture loss in transit due to evaporation, mix should be covered 
with tarpaulin. The material is usually kept wet during transport and laying to reduce the 
likelihood of particle segregation.
The mix may be spread by a paver finisher. However in case of multilayer construction 
the bottom layer/layers may be allowed to be laid by motor grader. In exceptional cases, 
for portions where mechanical means cannot be used, manual method of spreading can 
be adopted. The equipment used for spreading shall be capable of spreading the material 
uniformly 	all over the surface. Single full width paver or two pavers of lesser width working 
in tandem within the short distances should be used for obtaining good results.
The paver finisher shall be self-propelled, having features given in Annexure.
The surface of the layer as spread shall be carefully checked with templates and all high or 
low spots remedied by removing or adding wet mix material as may be required. The layer 
thickness may be checked by depth blocks during construction. No segregation of coarse or 
fine particles shall be allowed. The layer as spread shall be of uniform gradation and shall not 
have pockets of fine materials.

4.6	
Compaction
After the mix has been laid to the required thickness, grade and cross-fall/camber, the same 
shall be uniformly compacted to the full depth with a suitable roller. The speed of roller 
shall not exceed 5 km/hr. Formulation of compaction methodology to meet the compaction 
requirements of the Specifications shall be based on trial section. Guidelines in this regard 
are available in Annexure.
In portions having uni-directional crossfall/superelevation, rolling shall commence from the 
lower edge and progress gradually towards the upper edge. Thereafter roller should progress 
parallel to the center line of the road, uniformly overlapping each preceding track by at least 
one third width until the entire surface has been rolled.
In portions in camber, rolling should begin at the edge with the roller running forward and 
backward until the edge has been compacted firmly. The roller then progress gradually towards 
the center parallel to center line of the road uniformly overlapping each of the proceeding 
track by at least one third width. The process of compaction is then to be repeated from the 
other edge of the pavement upto the center line until the entire pavement is compacted.
Any displacement occurring as a result of reversing of the direction of a roller or from any 
other cause shall be corrected. Alternate trips of the roller shall be terminated in stop atleast 
1 m away from the preceding stop.
Along forms, kerbs, walls or other places not accessible to the roller, the mix shall be thoroughly 
compacted with mechanical tampers or a plate compactor. Skin patching of an area without 
scarifying the surface to permit proper bonding of the added material shall not be permitted.
Rolling should not be done when the subgrade is soft or yielding or when it causes a wave-like 
motion in the sub-base/base coarse or sub-grade. If irregularities develop during rolling which 
exceed 12 mm when tested with a 3 metre straight edge, the surface should be loosened 
and premixed material added or removed as required before rolling again so as to achieve a 
uniform surface conforming to the desired grade and cross-fall. In no case should the use of 
unmixed material be permitted to make up the depressions.
Rolling shall be continued till the density achieved is atleast 100 percent of the maximum dry 
density for the material as determined by the method outlined in IS:2720 (Part VIII).
After completing, the finished surface shall present a well-closed appearance, free from 
movement under compaction equipment or any compaction marks, ridges, cracks and loose 
material. All loose, segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be made good to the full 
thickness of the layers and recompacted until the specified density is achieved through out 
the entire layer. The finally compacted layer shall be free from surface laminations, portions 
exhibiting segregation of the fine and coarse aggregate, corrugations, or other defects that 
may adversely affect the performance of the layer.
Longitudinal joints and edges shall be constructed true to the delineating line parallel to the 
center line of the road. All longitudinal and transverse joints shall be cut vertical to the full 
thickness of the previously laid mix before laying the fresh mix.

4.7	
Setting and Drying
The laid wet mix macadam course shall be allowed to dry for 24 hours before priming.
5  OPENING  TO  TRAFFIC
No vehicular traffic except construction vehicles with speed less than 5 km/hr shall be allowed 
on the finished WMM surface.
6  SURFACE  FINISH,  CONSTRUCTION  TOLERANCES,  
QUALITY  CONTROL  OF  WORK  AND  TESTING
6.1	
The surface level of a WMM as a base course shall have the tolerance of 
+ 10 mm and - 10 mm. For checking compliance with this, surface levels shall be taken on 
a grid of points placed 6.25 m longitudinally and 3.5 m transversely. For 10 consecutive 
measurements taken longitudinally or transversely, not more than one measurement shall be 
permitted to exceed the above tolerances, thus one measurement being not in excess of 5 
mm above the permitted tolerance.
6.2	
The longitudinal profile shall also be checked by a 3 metre straight edge at the 
middle of each traffic lane along a line parallel to the center line of the road. The maximum 
allowable difference between the road surface and underside of a 3 metre straight edge shall 
be 8 mm.
The frequency of the quality control tests shall be as under:
Table 3  Frequency of Quality Control Tests of WMM
Sl. No.
Description of Quality Control Test

6.
Flakiness and Elongation Index
One test per 500 m3 subjected to minimum 
1 test per day
6.3	
The in-place dry density shall be measured according to sand replacement method. 
If a nuclear method is used for determining density and moisture content, tests will be done at 
least at the same frequency required when using the sand replacement method but at each 
nuclear densometer test location, the average of two readings taken at positions rotated by 
180 degree shall be used. A check/comparison test using the sand replacement method shall 
be carried out as required by the Engineer.



======================================================================

IRC:109-2015
7
Initial calibration of the nuclear testing equipment shall be done by carrying out at least fifty 
tests in parallel with the sand replacement method for each different material encountered. 
Whenever there is a change of source of material  calibration shall be carried out in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s guidelines or as required by the Engineer to establish a moisture 
correction and any correction of density required. Check tests will be used to update the 
initial calibration of the nuclear density testing equipment. The calibration shall be repeated at 
regular intervals i.e. for every change of material source or 3 months, whichever is earlier.
For testing the compaction requirements, test locations shall be chosen only through random 
sampling techniques. Control shall not be based on the result of any one test but on the 
mean value of 5-10 density determinations. The number of tests in one set of measurements 
shall be 6 (if non-destructive tests are carried out, the number of tests shall be doubled) 
as long as it is felt that sufficient control over the constituent materials forming the mix is 
being exercised. If considerable variations i.e. 15 percent and above are observed between 
individual density results, the minimum number of tests in one set of measurement shall be 
increased to 10. The acceptance criteria shall be subject to condition that the mean density 
of a set of measurement shall not be less than the specified density plus:
For ready reference & using the afore-mentioned equation, the acceptance criteria shall be 
subjected to the compliance of the following requirements:
No. of Tests

Minimum value of any single test
(% relative field compaction)
96.8
96.7
96.6
96.5
6.4 
Rectification of Surface Irregularity
Where the surface irregularity of the layer as laid exceeds the permissible tolerances or 
where the course is otherwise defective due to underside layer soil/GSB getting mixed 
with the aggregates, the full thickness of the layer shall be scarified over the affected area 
reshaped with added premix material removed and replaced with fresh premix material and 
recompacted. The area treated in this manner shall not be less than 5 m long and 2 m wide. 
In no case shall depressions be filled up with unmixed and ungraded material or fines.

stockpiling arrangement is suitable for obtaining required shape and size of aggregates and 
storing them in different stockpiles. The stone crushing plant should have necessary process 
controls for consistent production of required size and quantity of aggregate.

Wet Mix Plant
This plant consists of following: considering the relatively larger sized aggregates only power 
mixer (forced mixing) should be used, which could be Vertical Shaft Mixers (Pan Mixers) or 
Horizontal Shaft Mixers (Trough Mixers or Pugmill). Pan Mixers are generally suitable for 
aggregate sizes up to 40 mm, whereas Trough Mixers or Pugmill can handle even larger 
sized aggregates. Plant should be calibrated for accuracy before commencing work and 
thereafter at regular intervals.
	
i)	
Bin Feeder Unit: This is the unit for aggregate gradation control and 
feeding. It should have minimum 4 storage bins with adjustable quadrant 
side gates for smooth flow of aggregate onto auxiliary conveyor underneath. 
It is advisable to have grizzly screens for oversize particle rejection on top 
of bins, in the absence of which a scalping screen should be used after the 
bin feeder. The auxiliary conveyors should preferably be driven by variable 
speed motors. These auxiliary conveyors should discharge aggregate onto 
a single gathering conveyor underneath which should then transfers material 
onto the Secondary Conveyor (if grizzly screens are present) or onto the 
Scalping Screen (if grizzly screens are absent). In those plants with fixed 
speed motors, gradation is controlled by adjusting the gate openings. A 
surface vibration should be provided on the outside of the sand/fines bin to 
maintain uniform flow.
	
ii)	
Grizzly Screen/Scalping Screen: Both are used for screening of oversized 
particles which might cause damage to the mixing elements, if allowed to 
pass into it. grizzly screens are a grid of parallel metal bars set on a static 
inclined frame on top of the bin at an angle of 30 degree to 45 degree  in the 
direction of the slope and movement of aggregates. A single deck vibratory

scalping screen placed at the discharge end of the gathering conveyor will 
also screen out oversized particles.
	
iii)	
Water Supply Unit: Water Supply Unit consists of a water storage tank, a 
water pump, pump drive motor and water pipelines. The tank has to be of 
adequate capacity with provision for replenishing the water. The water pump 
feeding water to the mix is usually a centrifugal pump driven by an electric 
motor. The pump capacity should be adequate to provide the design moisture 
content at maximum plant production rate. Water pipeline draws water from 
the storage tank and discharges it into the pugmill through a set of nozzles 
which are formed by making perforations in the pipe. The nozzle pipe should 
be installed transverse to the direction of aggregate flow for uniform mixing 
with water.
	
iv)	
Pugmill: This is basically a trough mixer with paddle arms and paddle tips 
mounted on shaft(s). Usually a twin shaft pugmill is used. The rotating paddle 
tips churn the mix within the stationery pugmill chamber. This forced mixing 
causes thorough and uniform mixing of aggregate and water to produce a 
homogenous mix. The pugmill should have replaceable inner liner plates. 
The clearance between the tips of the paddles and liners should be less 
than maximum aggregate size so that the aggregates are pushed forward 
while mixing. The paddles should be adjustable so that clearance can be set 
according to maximum size of aggregate. The size of the mixing chamber 
and the size and number of paddles determine the maximum output capacity 
of the pugmill. The pugmill should be fully covered. There should be safety 
mechanism to prevent accidental powering-on of the pugmill while being 
accessed during inspection or maintenance or cleaning.
	
v)	
Gob Hopper: This hopper is available at the discharge end of the load out 
conveyor and is used for temporary storage of mix and for enmass drop of 
the mix onto dumper/tipper to minimise segregation. The hopper gates are 
hydraulically or pneumatically controlled and may be operated manually or 
automatically (preferable).
	
vi)	
Conveyor System: Belt conveyors are used at various stages for aggregate 
and mix handling. Usually, there is a secondary conveyor which takes 
aggregate from the Bin Feeder and loads them into the pugmill. There is also 
a loadout conveyor which takes the mix from the pugmill and loads it into the 
gob hopper. The inclination of belt conveyors should be less than 19 degree 
to prevent aggregate rollback. For steep angles ribbed belts or cleated belts 
may be used. High level conveyors should have belts with cleats on sides

and/or safety sheets below belts, to restrain or retain aggregates falling over 
the sides. Conveyors having load cells installed underneath should have a 
self tensioning arrangement to maintain constant tension in the belt.
	
vii)	
Aggregate Metering System: Generally a load cell based conveyor 
weighing arrangement is used to measure the aggregate mass flow rate. If a 
scalping screen is used, the load cell should be placed under the secondary 
conveyor, otherwise it may be placed under the gathering conveyor too. High 
end plants may have individual bins of the bin feeder unit mounted on load 
cells so as to have precise control on aggregate gradation. In such cases 
the sum of individual aggregate mass flow rates from individual bins yield the 
total aggregate mass flow rate. The aggregate metering system should be 
calibrated before commencement of work and thereafter at regular intervals 
which should not be more than 7 days for conveyor weighing arrangement 
and 1 month for bin weighing arrangement. The tolerance shall be ± 2 
percent.
	
viii)	 Water Metering System: Metering of water flow rate can be achieved 
with the help of electronic flow meter measuring the water flow rate and 
(i) variable speed centrifugal pump or (ii) Electronically operated hydraulic 
Valve. In the former case the pump discharge itself is controlled by varying 
the speed of centrifugal pump with the help of a variable speed motor. In 
the latter case, the effective flow into the water pipeline discharging into the 
pugmill is controlled with the valve which diverts a portion of the flow back 
into the water storage tank through a bypass line. The metering system 
should be calibrated before commencement of work and thereafter at regular 
intervals which should not be more than 7 days for variable speed motor 
driven centrifugal pump, not more than 3 months for electronically operated 
hydraulic valve. A mechanically operated totalizer should be installed in the 
water pipeline after the delivery valve to record the cumulative flow and use 
it to calibrate the electronic flow meter. The tolerance shall be ±1 percent.
	
ix)	
Control Cabin: There shall be a central control cabin housing the control 
system for centralized plant operations. The control cabin shall be designed 
and erected to enable full view of the plant from inside. Alternatively, CCTV 
system may be used to provide real-time view of the full plant. The control 
cabin shall have air conditioning, proper illumination, and furnishing. It should 
have a public address system for addressing/warning people outside. The 
operation and maintenance manual of the plant, calibration charts, plant 
logbook, and such other documents related to plant operation, maintenance 
and performance shall be kept in the control cabin at all times.

For the purposes of above Table 4, the following shall apply:
	
i)	
The number of passes is the number of times that each point on the surface 
of the layer being compacted shall be traversed by the item of compaction 
plant in its operating mode.
	
ii)	
The compaction plant in the Table 4 is categorised in terms of static mass. 
The mass per metre width of roll is the total mass on the roll divided by the 
total roll width. Where a smooth-wheeled roller has more than one axle, the 
category of the machine shall be determined on the basis of the axle giving 
the highest value of mass per metre width.
	
iii)	
Where the mechanical vibration is applied to two rolls in tandem, the minimum 
number of passes shall be half the number given in the above Table 4 for 
the appropriate mass per metre width of one vibrating roll but if one roll 
differs in mass per metre width from the other, the number of passes shall 
be calculated as for the roll with the smaller value. Alternatively the minimum 
number of passes may be determined by treating the machine as having a 
single vibrating roll with a mass per metre width equal to that of the roll with 
the higher value.
