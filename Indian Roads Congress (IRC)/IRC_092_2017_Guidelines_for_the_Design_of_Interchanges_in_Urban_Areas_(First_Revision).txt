GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF  
INTERCHANGES IN URBAN AREAS
1 Introduction
The Guidelines for the design of interchanges in urban areas was first published in 1985. The 
document helps designers, engineers, planners in developing appropriate solutions to urban 
traffic problem by designing interchanges for different situations in urban areas to facilitate 
fast and smooth motorised traffic.
Since last decade, traffic in urban areas has witnessed a significant growth and also its 
consequences on safety. Furthermore, the National Urban Transport Policy, formulated by 
the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) emphasizes that our focus should be on 
movement of people, rather than vehicle alone. Therefore, need for a new comprehensive 
guideline has arisen so as to include the recent advancement.
Accordingly, the task was assigned to Urban Roads and Street Committee (H-8) of during 
tenure 2015-18. The H-8 Committee in its meeting held on 20th May, 2015 decided to revise 
this document to include the recent advancement and make it more comprehensive. Initial 
draft was prepared by Sub-group headed by Dr. Sewa Ram, Professor, SPA, comprising 
Ms. Ammu Gopalakrishnan and Dr. Mayank Dubey. This draft was discussed and deliberated 
at length in numerous meeting of H-8 Committee. Other than H-8 Committee members 
valuable inputs were received from Ms. Sonal Shah, ITDP; Ms. Aparna Vijaykumar, 
Mr. Parin Visariya, Mr. Amit Bhatt, WRI and Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure, MoRTH. The H-8 
Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 20th May, 2017 for 
placing before the HSS Committee.
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved the 
draft document in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The Executive Committee in its 
meeting held on 13th July, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing 
it before the Council. The Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur on 14th July, 2017 
considered and approved the draft IRC:92 “Guidelines for Traffic Interchanges” (First 
Revision) for printing.
Grade separated intersection or road interchange is fundamentally a crossing of two or 
more roadways at different levels to meet its prerequisite. Interchanges are predominantly 
used to carry fast moving motorized traffic, to decongest an at-grade intersection or to 
segregate the conflicting movements of an intersection, thus improving its operational 
efficiency. 
Type of interchange, shape and pattern of the interchange ramps, planning considerations, 
geometric design factors, composition of traffic, capacity, speed, right of way, cost, safety, 
topography, environmental factors etc. varies from site to site. Interchanges, therefore, 
are necessarily designed individually in light of the above considerations. This publication 
provides guidelines for planning and developing appropriate designs for interchanges under 
different situations in urban areas.

2 Scope
The revised guidelines are applicable mainly for urban roads. But in some case, non-urban 
roads also have been included and guidelines may be followed.
3 Glossary of terms
Some of the key terms in planning and design considerations of urban traffic interchanges 
are given below:
	
•	
Auxiliary Lane or Operational Lane: An extra lane provided between 
interchanges, giving motorists more time to merge in or out. The lane is 
created when an entrance ramp meets the highway, and drops out (“exit 
only”) with the exit ramp. 
	
•	
Braid Interchange: A design feature where two nearly parallel ramps must 
cross each other and use a grade separation to avoid weaving or crossing. 
Most often this occurs when an on-ramp from one nearby interchange is 
braided to avoid interfering with an off-ramp for the next one. Fig. 3.1 shows 
a typical Braid Interchange.
	
•	
Buttonhook Ramp or Hook Ramp: J-shaped ramp that connects to a 
parallel or diagonal street or frontage road, which is often well removed 
from the interchange structure and other ramps. Fig. 3.2 shows a typical 
Buttonhook ramp or Hook ramp.
	
•	
Basic Lanes: The minimum number of lanes designated and maintained 
over a significant length of route, irrespective of changes in traffic volume 
and the requirements of lane balance.
	
•	
Candela (cd): The unit of luminous intensity.
	
•	
Candlepower (cp): Luminous intensity expressed in Candelas. It is not an 
indication of total light output.
	
•	
Cloverleaf Interchange: A form of interchange that provides indirect right-
turn movements in all four quadrants by means of loops. Generally used 
where the turning and weaving volumes are relatively low. This type of 
interchange eliminates all crossing conflicts found in a diamond interchange 
but requires more area. The cloverleaf type of interchange can have one 
or two points of entry and exit on each through roadway. The complete 
implementation, using eight ramps, is also called a full cloverleaf. Fig. 3.3 
shows typical Cloverleaf interchange.
	
•	
Co-efficient of Utilization (cu): The ratio of the luminous flux (lumens) from 
the lantern received on the surface of the roadway to the lumens emitted by 
the lantern lamp alone.

•	
Collector–Distributor Road: An auxiliary road separated laterally from, 
but generally parallel to a through road and joining it at a limited number of 
points. The road serves to collect traffic from and distribute traffic to several 
local roads.
	
•	
Complete Interchange: An interchange providing enough ramps to provide 
access for all possible traffic movements is known as a Complete Interchange. 
A complete interchange between expressway and any other road (not an 
expressway) requires at least four ramps. Four ramps are required for each 
crossing of roads. Thus, complete interchanges between two expressways 
require at least eight ramps and a five-way complete interchange would 
require twenty ramps.
	
•	
Design Traffic Volume: The number of vehicles usually expressed as an 
hourly volume estimated to use the road or element of the interchange in the 
design year. 
	
•	
Design Year: Design year is the year for which the interchange is designed 
to operate acceptably under traffic volumes likely at that time. It is generally 
20 years beyond the scheduled year of opening of the interchange.
	
•	
Directional Interchange: An interchange, generally between two travel 
lanes, providing direct travel for some or all right turn movements. 
	
•	
Diverge: An area at a split of two carriageways other than an exit. 
	
•	
Diamond: A basic four-ramp interchange between an expressway and a 
surface road. The four diagonal ramps, one in each quadrant, suggest a 
diamond shape.
	
•	
Diverging Diamond Interchange: This is similar to a traditional diamond 
interchange, except that it uses directional lanes for the non-highway to cross 
over each other on either side of the highway, altering the direction of travel 
on the over/underpass through the use of traffic lights. This allows all turns 
to and from the highway to be made without crossing the opposite direction 
of travel, increasing the capacity when compared to a typical diamond 
interchange. Fig. 3.4 shows a typical Diverging Diamond Interchange.
	
•	
Double Trumpet: A double-trumpet interchange version can be provided 
where a toll road meets another toll road or a free highway. They are also 
useful when most traffic on the terminating highway is going the same 
direction. The turn that isn’t used often would get the slower loop ramp. 
Fig. 3.5 shows a typical Double Trumpet Interchange. 
	
•	
Entry: The path where an entry ramp joins a ramp or through carriageway. 
	
•	
Exit: The path where an exit ramp leaves a ramp or through carriageway. 
	
•	
Flyover: A bridge over another road for allowing traffic without interruption 
with its approaches on both sides is known as Flyover.
	
•	
Frontage road: A road contiguous with, and generally parallel to the major 
road, designed to provide an access and/or a traffic movement for local 
traffic.

•	
Gore: The area bounded by the edge of two carriageways immediately 
beyond the divergence of those carriageways.
	
•	
Grade separation: The separations of road, rail or any other traffic so that 
crossing movements which would otherwise conflict are affected at different 
elevations. (Also refer to “underpass” and “overpass”).
	
•	
Half Diamond Interchange: An interchange with only two diagonal ramps, 
one entrance and one exit, in adjacent quadrants. This interchange serves 
traffic to and from one direction along the expressway, but ignores the other.
	
•	
Interchange: A grade separation of two or more roads with one or more 
interconnecting roadways is called as an Interchange.
	
•	
Interchange spacing: It is the distance measured along the main roadway 
between the center lines of the intersecting roadways that maintain ramp 
access to the through highway.
	
•	
Lantern: A complete unit consisting of lamp, choke, capacitor together with 
the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamp and 
to connect the lamp to power supply.
	
•	
Level of Service: A quality measure describing operational conditions 
within a traffic stream, generally in terms of such service measures as speed 
and travel time, freedom to manoeuvre, traffic interruptions, comfort and 
convenience.
	
•	
Lighting unit: Assembly of light pole & lantern.
	
•	
Loop: A ramp where traffic changes direction by 90° by means of a 270° turn.
	
•	
Lumen: The unit of luminous flux.
	
•	
Luminance (photometric brightness): Brightness of any diffusively 
reflecting surface illuminated at a density of luminous flux.
	
•	
Lux (lx): SI unit of illumination on a surface of one square meter in area 
from a uniform source of candela intensity or equal to one lumen per square 
meter.
	
•	
Luminous flux: Total light radiated by a light source as evaluated photo 
metrically.
	
•	
Maintenance factor: Ratio of average illumination on the working area, given 
by a new installation to that of an installation with decreased effectiveness 
due to dust, ageing of lamp, etc.
	
•	
Merge: The area at a junction of two carriageways other than at an entry 
ramp.
	
•	
Multilevel Interchange: An interchange with mutually crossing carriageways 
at three or more different levels.
	
•	
Overpass: A grade separation where the subject carriageway passes over 
an intersecting carriageway or railway.

•	
Partial Cloverleaf: Partial cloverleaf or parclos, involve fewer ramps. The 
popular six-ramp version provides two exit ramps (with left turns at the end) 
and four entrance ramps (all right turns). Many four-ramp parclos may be 
called folded diamonds, as they serve the same traffic movements as a 
conventional diamond.
	
•	
Quadrant: One of four slices of land created when two roads intersect.
	
•	
Ramp: Carriageway within an interchange provided for travel between two 
legs of the intersecting roads. 
	
•	
Roundabout Interchange/Bridged Rotary Interchange: A roundabout 
interchange is a type of interchange between a controlled access and 
a minor road. The slip roads to and from the carriageways converge at a 
single roundabout, which is grade-separated from the carriageway lanes 
with bridges. Fig. 3.6 shows a Roundabout or Bridged Rotary Interchange. 
	
•	
Service interchange: An interchange that does not maintain free-flow 
through its elements for all major movements. 
	
•	
Single point urban interchange (SPUI) or single-point diamond 
Interchange: A type of diamond where the diagonal ramps are placed as 
close as possible parallel to the expressway, so that ramp traffic in effect 
meets at a single point on the surface road directly below (or above) the 
expressway. Fig. 3.7 shows a Single Point Urban or Single Point Diamond 
Interchange.
	
•	
Slip Ramp: A diagonal ramp, more properly called a cross connection, which 
connects with a parallel frontage road.
	
•	
Split-level Diamond Interchange: This interchange is better known as 
the 3-level diamond or volleyball interchange. All turning movements are 
managed in an intermediate square structure connecting the eight ramps. 
Turning traffic travels around the square in the same direction as a roundabout. 
Through traffic can proceed on either intersecting road without stopping. 
Fig. 3.8 shows a typical Volleyball Interchange.
	
•	
Stack Interchange: A four-level semi-directional interchange with no loop 
ramps, typically serving two high-traffic expressways. Fig. 3.9 shows a 
typical Stack Interchange.
	
•	
Surface Road: A surface road allows access by traffic signal or stop sign, or 
allows turns across opposing traffic.
	
•	
System interchange: An interchange that maintains free-flow through its 
elements for all major movements.
	
•	
Turning roadway: A carriageway, usually one-way, at an intersection or 
interchange for turning vehicles.
	
•	
Trumpet Interchange: A three-way interchange with no crossing movements, 
featuring one 270-degree loop ramp opposite the terminating roadway, and

IRC:92-2017
7
a semi-directional ramp following the loop to the outside. Fig. 3.10 shows a 
typical Trumpet Interchange.
	
•	
Underpass: A grade separation where the subject carriageway passes 
under an intersecting carriageway or railway.
	
•	
Uninterrupted Flow: A condition in which a vehicle travelling in a traffic 
stream is not required to stop or slow down for reasons other than those 
caused by the presence of other vehicles in that stream.
	
•	
Weaving: The movement in the same direction of vehicles within two or 
more traffic streams intersecting at a small angle so that the vehicles in one 
stream cross other streams gradually. 
	
•	
Transit: The change in travel mode, in which vehicles (including buses, 
streetcars, and street-running light rail) stop at regular intervals along the 
roadway to pick up and drop off passengers.

4 Planning considerations for interchange
The selection of a particular interchange depends on the following planning considerations. 
These parameters are discussed in detail in the following sub-sections.

Interchange Spacing 
Interchange spacing is an important consideration in the planning and design of new or 
modified interchanges. Interchange spacing is the distance measured along the main 
roadway between the centre lines of the intersecting roadways that maintain ramp access 
to the through highway. The spacing is intended to minimize the disruption of entering and 
exiting traffic to the mainline of the highway and to prevent insufficient sign spacing.
In urban areas, there should be a 1.6 km minimum spacing between interchanges to allow 
sufficient space for entrance and exit manoeuvres. Closer spacing may require the use of 
collector-distributor roads to remove the merging/diverging and accelerating/decelerating 
traffic from the expressway. In rural, undeveloped areas, interchanges should be spaced at 
more than 4.8 km apart. 
4.3	
Access Control
A proposed new or revised interchange access must connect to an expressway, highway, 
road, or street. Access control is established to preserve the safety and efficiency of specific 
road and to preserve the public investment.
The numbers of access points are determined by the:
	
•	
Functional classification of interchange
	
•	
Characteristics of the traffic
	
•	
Current and future land use
	
•	
Environment and aesthetics
	
•	
Highway design and operation
	
•	
Economic considerations

4.4	
Landuse
Interchange areas attract almost all types of land development. Each land use type namely; 
commercial, residential, industrial and recreational etc finds desirable features in interchange 
locations. Following are the major factors that may influence decisions to locate at an 
interchange:
	
(i)	
The market or demand for the use and the land; 
	
(ii)	
The physical characteristics of the site including infrastructure; and 
	
(iii)	 Local objectives as embodied in plans, policies and regulations. 
Each potential land use should be considered in terms of these factors. 
4.5	
Warrants
Interchanges and grade separations occur when two or more roadways required to cross at 
different levels. In many instances, the decision to provide a grade-separated intersection 
should be made based on careful consideration of a number of factors. These factors are 
referred to as warrants and include the following:
4.5.1	
Design Consideration
Once it is decided to develop routing as an expressway, it should be determined whether each 
intersecting highway/road will be terminated, rerouted, or provided with a grade separation or 
interchange. The chief concern is providing continuous flow on the expressway.
4.5.2	
Safety
The crash reduction benefits of an interchange may warrant its selection particularly on an 
at-grade intersection prone to accidents.
4.5.3	
Congestion
An interchange may be warranted where the level of service of an at-grade intersection 
is unacceptable and the intersection cannot be modified to provide an acceptable level of 
service. 
4.5.4	
Site Topography
At certain sites, a grade separated intersection may be more feasible than an at-grade 
intersection due to local topography.
4.5.5	
Traffic Volume
Interchanges are desirable at cross roads with heavy traffic volumes. The elimination of 
conflicts due to high crossing volume greatly improves the movement of traffic.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017

4.5.6	
Road-User Benefits
When interchanges are designed and operated efficiently, they significantly reduce the 
travel time and costs when compared to at-grade intersections. Therefore, an interchange is 
warranted if an analysis reveals that road-user benefits will exceed the costs over the service 
life of the interchange.
Hence, for a thumb-rule, following postulates can be taken as guiding principle conceptualising 
a traffic interchange:
	
•	
At all crossings of highway of the major hierarchy to be developed as fully 
access controlled.
	
•	
At all major crossings on highways to be developed to expressway standards.
	
•	
At the crossing of a major arterial road with another road of similar category 
carrying heavy traffic.
	
•	
When an at-grade intersection fails to cater the volume of traffic resulting in 
congestion and frequent blockage at the intersection e.g., when total traffic 
of all the arms of intersection exceeds 10,000 PCU per hour. 
	
•	
High rate of fatal accidents at an at-grade intersection in spite of other traffic 
control or improvement measures.
	
•	
When the topography is such that interchange is the only alternative that can 
be constructed economically.
5 Types of interchanges 
Interchanges can be broadly classified as:
	
•	
System interchange: An interchange that maintains free-flow through its 
elements for all major movements. System interchanges mainly connects 
from major road to major road. A major road typically refers to an expressway, 
major highway or major arterial road that does not contain at-grade 
intersections. 
	
•	
Service interchange: An interchange that does not maintain free-flow 
through its elements for all major movements. Service interchanges mainly 
connects from major road to minor road. A minor road typically refers to a 
highway, arterial or sub-arterial road that contains at-grade intersection. 
Based upon partial and complete grade separation along with number of arms, interchanges 
can also be classified as:
	
i.	
3-arm Partially Grade Separated
	
ii.	
3-arm Totally Grade Separated
	
iii.	
4-arm Partially Grade Separated
	
iv.	
4-arm Totally Grade Separated

The common geometric configurations of interchanges are the trumpet, diamond, cloverleaf, 
rotary and directional interchanges. Within each type of interchanges, there can be several 
variations such as split diamond, partial cloverleaf etc. depending on the ramp arrangements. 
The broad operational characteristics of each of the common interchange types are brought 
out in this section.
5.1	
Trumpet Interchange
Fig. 5.1, shows a typical 3-leg interchanges which takes the shape of trumpet. This 
is the simplest interchange form adaptable to ‘T’ or ‘Y’ intersections. Of the two right 
turning movements, one is negotiated by a loop while the other is by a semi-direct 
connection. Diagonal ramps are provided for left turning movements. There can be 
several variations of the design depending on the type of connection provided. The type of 
connection provided for the right turning movements should be based on traffic volumes. 
The ramps catering for heavy traffic volumes should preferably be provided with direct 
connections.
Fig. 5.1 Typical 3-leg Interchange
5.2	
Diamond Interchange
Fig. 5.2 shows a typical diamond interchange. Diamond interchange is the simplest of 4-leg 
interchange designs and is particularly adaptable for major-minor highway intersections. The 
ramps which provide for one-way movement are usually elongated along the major highway 
and may be curved or parallel to the major highway. The ramp terminals on the minor road 
are the at-grade intersections providing for right and left turning movements. These at-grade 
intersections may be controlled by signals if warranted by traffic volumes or in the absence 
of adequate sight distance.

Fig. 5.2 Diamond Interchange
The diamond design requires minimum land, involves only a small extra travel distance for 
right turning traffic, is the least costly, and will be found ideal for most of the cases both in 
urban and rural areas. However, this type of interchange has the demerit of limited capacity 
because of the at-grade terminals on the minor road. The situation can be improved by 
widening the cross road through the interchange area, or the ramp terminals or both. Further 
improvements can be effected by having a split diamond or 3-level diamond, but this will 
involve more than one bridge. 
5.3	
Cloverleaf Interchange
Fig. 5.3 shows a typical full cloverleaf interchange. The design consists of one loop ramp for 
right turning traffic and one outer connection for left turning traffic in each quadrant. Vehicles 
desiring to turn right are required to turn left through about 270 degrees before attaining the 
desired direction. 
This type of interchange provides for continuous movement to all interchanging traffic and is 
particularly suitable for the crossing of two major roads of equal importance in rural areas. In 
urban areas, this type of interchange tends to use up too much of costly urban space. 
Cloverleaf design involves appreciable extra level distance for the right moving traffic and 
required a large space. Though all crossing movements conflicts are eliminated, a weaving 
section is created between the exit and entry points near the structure along each direction 
of travel on the intersection roads. These weaving sections constitute a critical element in the 
design, and unless these are designed to have adequate length and capacity, there may be 
serious loss in capacity besides increased hazards. 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
14
In cases where at-grade crossing on one of the roads can be tolerated, full cloverleaf 
development will not be required. For such cases, partial cloverleaf which is a modification 
that combines some elements of a diamond interchange with one or more loops to eliminate 
only the more critical conflicts can be adopted. A number of variations are possible for meeting 
the different site conditions and traffic distribution. Fig. 5.4 depicts design of partial cloverleaf.

5.4	
Rotary Interchange
This type of design is particularly useful where a number of roads intersect at the interchange 
and in locations where sufficient land is available. It requires that construction of two bridges 
and generally necessitated more land than for a diamond layout. The main highway goes over 
or under the rotary intersection and turning movements are accommodated by the diagonal 
ramps. Fig. 5.5 shows a typical rotary interchange.

======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
15
The capacity of a rotary interchange is similar to that of at-grade rotary. High speed operations 
cannot be maintained on the minor road because of the usually short weaving distances. It 
can, however, operate satisfactorily at low speeds. Also, this type of design entails only a little 
additional travel distance for interchanging traffic which is a specific advantage when slow 
moving traffic is present. 
5.5	
Directional Interchange
3-Leg Directional
All Directional 4-Legs
Fig. 5.6 Types of Interchanges
Directional interchanges have ramps for right turning traffic which follow the natural direction 
of movement. This type of design required more than one structure, or a 3-level structure. 
Though operationally more efficient than other designs, these generally turn out to be very 
expensive. 
The interchanges illustrated above are common types of 4-leg interchanges. There can be 
variations depending on the traffic requirement, site conditions etc. Additional layouts of 
interchange are presented as under Fig. 5.6 and in Annexure 1.

6 Geometric Design Considerations
6.1	
Design Vehicle 
Motorized vehicles on road which establish the design characteristics of highways are 
considered as design vehicles. The design vehicles influence the geometric design of road 
width, turning radii, sight distance, horizontal and vertical alignments, storage length of 
auxiliary lanes, acceleration and deceleration lengths etc. The choice of the design vehicle 
depends on the functional classification of roadway and by the proportions of the various 
types and sizes of vehicles expected to use the facility. For detailed information on vehicle 
dimensions and weights, IRC:3 “Dimensions and weights of Road Design Vehicles” and 
IRC:SP:41 “Guidelines for the Design of At-Grade Intersections in Rural and Urban Areas” 
may be referred. 
6.2	
Ramps
Ramps or pattern of the various turning roadways determine the geometric configuration of 
the interchanges. The ramps can be broadly classified into the following four basic types, 
also illustrated in Fig. 6.1.

(iii)	 Semi-direct connection which is a ramp for right turns accomplished through 
a partial deviation from the intended path. 
	
(iv)	 Direct connection which is a ramp for right turns accomplished by a right 
directional and natural manoeuvre involving least extra travel distance. 
6.2.1	
Design speed of a ramp should be related to the design speed of the major 
intersecting highway. Ramp design speeds corresponding to the highway design speeds 
of 80 and 100 km/h are shown in Table 6.1. Design speeds of 80 km/h are applicable to 
interchanges on urban expressways.
6.2.2	
Horizontal curvature of ramps should preferably be of circular curve with transitions 
at either end. Where this is not feasible, 2-centered compound curves may be employed 
provided that the radius of any curve is not less than one-half the radius of the preceding curve. 
Minimum radius of horizontal curve and sight distance corresponding to the design speeds 
are also indicated in Table 6.1. The sight distance values are for safe stopping conditions and 
should be ensured both in the horizontal and vertical directions. The sight distance should be 
measured between two points, one at a height of 1.2 m above the road level representing the 
driver’s eye and the other 0.15 m above the road level denoting the object.

(ii) The radius of curvature values have been worked out for a maximum super elevation of

6.2.3	
Sight Distance
Another element of horizontal alignment is the Sight Distance across the inside of the curves. 
Because of many variables in alignment, in cross section, and in the number, type and location 
of potential obstructions, specific study is usually needed for each individual curve. With sight 
distance for the design speed as a control, the designer should check the actual conditions 
on each curve and make the appropriate adjustments to provide adequate sight distance. 
Figs. 6.2a to 6.2d shows the sight distance requirements at exit ramps.

time. In Fig. 6.2d, sight distances available to the physical nose and beyond are measured

Grade and Profile
Ramp profiles usually consist of a section of tangent grade between two vertical curves, 
valley curve at the lower end and the summit curve at the upper end. The ramp may be for 
one way or two-way operation. The tangent grades on ramps should be as flat as feasible, 
and desirably, it should be limited to a maximum of 4 per cent and in no case, should it 
exceed 6 per cent.
The vertical curves at either end of the ramp should be designed to provide for at least the 
safe Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) corresponding to the design speed of the ramp. The 
length of vertical curves for design speeds of 30 to 100 km/h are shown in Table 6.2.

Road Cross-Section
The ramp may be for one-way or two-way operation. The two-way, divided type of cross-section 
should be used with a minimum median width of 1.2 m. The approach width of pavement to 
be provided for each way will depend on the design hour traffic volume expected to use the 
ramp. The base capacity and recommended design service volume of urban road sections 
are given in Table 6.3. The minimum width of shoulders should be 2 m of which at least 
1 m should be paved. The shoulders should be properly delineated by means of pavement 
markings. The road markings may be provided as per the guidelines given in IRC:35 “Code 
of Practice for Road Markings”.

6.5	
Ramp Terminals
Ramp terminal is a portion adjacent to the through travelled way including speed change 
lanes, tapers and islands. Free-flow type ramp terminals where ramps traffic merges with 
(entrance terminal) or diverges from (exit terminal) high speed through highway at flat angles 
should invariably be provided with speed change lanes i.e., acceleration lane at entrance 
terminal and deceleration lane at exit terminal. The speed change lanes should be carefully 
sited to ensure that they are not hidden from the view of approaching traffic by horizontal or 
vertical curves.
6.5.1	
Entrance Terminal
The entrance terminal should be provided for sufficient length of acceleration lane to enable 
a driver to increase his speed from that on the turning ramp road-way to that of the operation 
speed of the highway. It should also provide manoeuvring space so that the driver can watch 
and take advantage of an opening in the adjacent stream of through traffic and move laterally 
into it. At the end of the acceleration lane, it is important that there should be no kerb or other 
obstruction which might be dangerous for a driver to merge with the traffic stream on the near 
side lane within the length of acceleration lane.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
21
Acceleration lanes are designed in two general forms, namely, the direct taper type and 
the parallel type. The taper type works on the principle of direct entry at a flat angle and 
part of the lane is separated from the through pavement of the highway. Though this form 
is generally preferred by the vehicles, it requires more space with the turning curve located 
farther away from the edge of the main highway. The parallel type has an additional lane 
built on the highway itself for speed change purposes. Both types will operate satisfactorily if 
designed properly, though the direct taper type will be appropriate for most cases. 
The length of acceleration lane is governed by the difference between the running speeds of 
the entrance curve of the ramp and of the highway. Table 6.4 gives the suggestive lengths 
for acceleration and deceleration lanes of the interchange. These lengths are particularly 
influenced by gradient.
6.5.2	
Exit Terminal
The exit terminal should be provided with sufficient length of deceleration lane to enable 
vehicles leaving the interchange at high speeds to reduce their speeds to negotiate the 
turning curve on the exit ramp. Similar to acceleration lane, deceleration lane can be of two 
forms, namely, direct taper type and parallel type. Recommended minimum and desirable 
lengths of deceleration lane are also indicated in Table 6.4.

Typical designs for entrance and exit terminal provided with acceleration and deceleration 
lane respectively are shown in Fig. 6.3. It may be noted that the nose separating the through 
lane from the turning lane is off-set from the edge of the through lane by 2 m to enable an 
errant vehicle which has inadvertently left the through lane to return with minimum disruption 
to through traffic. It is important that the “Core” area formed by the edges of the through 
and the turning lanes immediately beyond the point of divergence should be kept free of all 
hazardous obstructions so as to provide a clear recovery area for out of control vehicles. 
6.6	
Geometric Clearance
6.6.1	
Lateral Clearance
For underpass roadways, desirably the full roadway width at the approaches should be carried 
through the underpass. This implies that the minimum lateral clearance (i.e. the distance 
between the extreme edge of the carriageway and the face of nearest support, whether solid 
abutment pier or column) should equal the normal shoulder width.

as indicated. 
	
(iii)	
At locations marked (C) the through lane should be tapered (1 in 10) for a distance of

For overpass structures, the clearances are not that critical as in the case of underpasses 
since the drivers do not generally get the feeling of constriction. A cross-section with 225 mm 
wide kerb and open-type parapet will generally be suitable for most cases.
6.6.2	
Vertical Clearance
Vertical clearance at underpass should be minimum 5.5 m in urban areas, after making 
allowance for any future raising/strengthening of the underpass roadway.
For more details on clearances, reference may be made to IRC:SP:84 “Manual of Specifications 
and Standards for four-laning of Highways through Public Private Partnership”.

6.7	
Super-Elevation on Ramps
To maintain the design speed, highway and ramp curves are usually super elevated to 
overcome part of the centrifugal force that acts on a vehicle. On interchange ramps the super 
elevation rate is not as critical as on through pavements since drivers anticipate the sharper 
curvature and accept operation with higher side friction than on open highway curves. Even 
so, it is desirable to provide as much super elevation as practicable on ramps, particularly 
when the curve is sharp and on a down grade. The maximum super elevation desirable 
6 per cent but not more than 7 per cent. However, the development of a desirable super 
elevation without an abrupt change in cross slope at the ramp terminals is often prevented by 
the sharp curvature and short length of turning roadway. This is compensated by accepting 
higher side friction factors. The super-elevation rates with varying design speed (kmph) and 
radius (m) are presented in Fig. 6.4.

6.8	
Cross-Section of Major and Minor Road
Traffic passing through an interchange should be accorded the same degree of utility and 
safety as that given on the approaching highways. The design elements in the intersection 
area, therefore, should be consistent with those on the approaching highways, even 
though this may be difficult to attain. Preferably, the geometric design at the highway grade 
separation should be more liberal than that for the approaching highways to counterbalance 
any possible sense of restriction caused by the structure. Typical cross sections of urban 
roads are demonstrated in IRC:86 “Geometric Design Standards for Urban Roads in Plains”.

Typical Design Challenges at Interchanges
6.9.1	
Sight Distance at Exit Points
Sight distance is often determined with respect to the gore, which is the area where a ramp 
diverges from the mainline. Wherever feasible, decision sight distance should be provided to 
enable drivers approaching expressway exits to see the pavement surface from the painted 
gore nose to the limit of the paved gore. Proper advance signing of exits is also essential and 
additional signage is required when it is not possible to obtain the decision sight distance.
6.9.2	
Exit Speed Changes
The design should provide enough distance to allow safe deceleration from the highway 
design speed to the design speed of the first exit curve.
6.9.3	
Merges
The most frequent crash-type at interchanges is the rear-end collision at entrances onto the 
expressway. This problem can be reduced by providing an acceleration lane of sufficient 
length with adequate sight distance to allow a merging vehicle to attain speed and find a 
sufficient gap into which to merge.
6.9.4	
Right Side Entrances and Exits
Right-side entrances and exits should be avoided as they are contrary to driver expectations 
and have been associated with higher crash rates.
6.9.5	
Fixed-Object Hazards
A number of fixed objects may be located within interchanges, such as signs at exit 
gores or bridge piers and rails. These should be removed wherever possible, placed 
outside of the recovery area if possible, make breakaway, or shielded with barriers or 
impact attenuators.

6.9.6	
Wrong-Way Entrances
In almost all cases, wrong-way manoeuvres originate at interchanges. Some cannot be 
avoided, but others may result from driver confusion due to poor visibility, deceptive ramp 
arrangement, or inadequate signing. The interchange design must attempt to minimize 
wrong-way possibilities. This includes staggering ramp terminals and controlling access in 
the vicinity of the ramps.
6.9.7	
Excessive Speed on Minor Roadways
Ramp and merge designs should slow down drivers leaving the high-speed roadway so that 
they will not exceed the design speed on the secondary road. The section of the secondary 
road in the interchange area should have a design speed similar to (not faster than) the 
design of adjoining sections of that road.
6.10	
Pier Dimensions and Retaining Walls
The retaining walls shall be designed to withstand earth pressure including any live load 
surcharge and other loads acting on it, including self-weight, in accordance with the general 
principles specified for abutments. Stone masonry and plain concrete walls shall be of solid 
type. Reinforced concrete walls may be of solid, counterfort, buttressed or cellular type.
The geometrical shape (along width of flyover) of the pier should be suitable to enable its 
adaptation to variable heights where the height of piers is varying as in the approach portion. 
Vertical shape or some other geometric shape where proportions look pleasing to the eye in 
spite of change in one dimension (i.e. height) may be adopted. Single circular or oval piers 
may be suitable where least construction space is to be occupied. They look lighter and less 
massive.
For more details on piers and retaining walls, reference may be made to IRC:78 “Standard 
Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section VII-Foundations and 
Substructures (Revised Edition)”.

Pavement Selection
Pavement selection is a process to identify the most beneficial type of pavement structure for 
a given set of traffic, soils, climate, and other factors. It is sometimes as simple as specifying 
a certain type of pavement on the basis of traffic level, or it may be as complicated as 
assigning weighing factors to more than a dozen characteristics and evaluating the outcome 
through a scoring system. Whatever process is used, it should be a rational and explainable 
methodology in which the effects of different variables on decision making may be determined. 
Major factors for selecting a pavement are explained here. Further reference may be made 
to IRC:37 “Tentative Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements”. 
7 Traffic considerations
Following parameters of interchange planning and design are broadly dependent upon 
observed and anticipated traffic at the proposed location. 
7.1	
Traffic Studies
Traffic data collection and projections of traffic volumes are basic requirements for planning 
of road development and management schemes. For detailed planning of an interchange, it 
is necessary to study in detail the present and expected future traffic characteristics for that 
location. The surveys that should be carried out are as follows:
	
a)	
Road inventory survey
	
b)	
Classified traffic volume survey
	
c)	
Turning movement count survey
	
d)	
Vehicle occupancy survey
	
e)	
Roadside origin-destination survey
	
f)	
Vehicle speed and delay survey
	
g)	
Intersection volume-delay survey 
Further reference may be made to IRC:SP:19 “Manual for Survey, Investigation and 
Preparation of Road Projects” for traffic surveys and analysis.
7.2	
Level of Service
Level of Service is defined as a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within 
a traffic stream, and their perception by drivers/passengers.
Level of Service definition generally describes these conditions in terms of factors such as 
speed and travel time, freedom to manoeuvre, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience 
and safety. Six levels of service are recognized commonly, designated from A to F, with 
Level of Service A representing the best operating condition (i.e. free flow) and Level of 
Service F the worst (i.e. forced or break-down flow). On urban roads, the Level of Service 



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
27
is affected strongly by factors like the heterogeneity of traffic, speed regulations, frequency 
of intersections, presence of bus stops, on-street parking, roadside commercial activities, 
pedestrian volumes etc.
LOS A - Free flow of traffic.
LOS B - Reasonable free flow; no restrictions on the ability to manoeuvre; minor incidents 
do not disrupt the flow.
LOS C - Speed is close to free flow speed; slight restriction on the freedom to manoeuvre; 
queues may form as a result of any obstruction or incident.
LOS D - The speed starts decreasing with increasing traffic flow; density starts increasing; 
freedom to manoeuvre is restricted; a queue is formed because of minor incidents.
LOS E - Operation of the interchange is near or at capacity; the traffic stream has no usable 
gap; any disruption results in queuing and operations become extremely volatile.
LOS F- There is a breakdown in flow; the demand exceeds capacity and queues are formed 
behind breakdown points. 
For details, reference may be made to IRC:106 “Guidelines for Capacity of Urban Roads in 
Plain Areas”.

Weaving Sections - Merging and Diverging Sections
Fig. 7.1 Minimum Weaving Lengths along the Travelled Way for Varying Speeds  
and Lane Configuration



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
28
The movement in the same direction of vehicles within two or more traffic streams intersecting 
at a small angle so that the vehicles in one stream cross other streams gradually is termed 
as weaving movements. The road section where the weaving movements takes place are 
known as the weaving section. In a weaving section, merging and diverging operations take 
place sequentially with varying desires crossing each other in between. Fig. 7.1 illustrates the 
minimum weaving lengths along the travelled way for varying speeds and lane configurations. 
The maximum length over which merging and diverging movements are defined is 
450 meters. The merging/diverging influence area is reflected by the densities which 
consists of the right and next-to-right lane; and the acceleration or deceleration lane 
450 meters upstream of diverge or downstream of a merge lane. The density reflects the 
average of all vehicles across all lanes of the segment between the entry and exit points of 
the segment.

Fig. 7.2b Diverging Movements
Fig. 7.2c Weaving Movements Across Each Other’s Path
7.4	
Ramp Metering
Traffic signals which are placed at the expressway on ramps are called ramp meters. The 
purpose of ramp metering is to reduce congestion or improve merge operations on urban 
expressways. They control the traffic flow entering the mainline such that the capacity 
downstream is not exceeded and therefore addresses the problem of congestion on the 
expressways. Depending on the number of lanes as well as the usage of high occupancy 
vehicle lanes, the following types of ramp meter are provided:
	
a)	
Ramp for Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV)-A single ramp is used at locations 
where the peak hour design volume is low, i.e., 720 vehicles per hour or less. 
It is provided where a High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane is not feasible.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
29
	
b)	
Ramp for SOV/HOV-A dual lane ramp meter is provided for peak hour design 
volume of up to 720 vehicles per hour. When the HOV is greater than or 
equal to 9 per cent of the total peak hour volume, an HOV lane addition will 
be warranted.
	
c)	
Ramp for 2 SOV- A dual lane ramp meter is provided when the peak hour 
volume is moderate to high, i.e, it exceeds 720 vehicles per hour.
8 Interchange selection parameters 
The decision to provide a grade-separated intersection should be made based on careful 
consideration of a number of factors as discussed in section on “Warrants”. Traffic passing 
through an interchange should be afforded the same degree of utility and safety as that 
given on the approaching highways. The design speed, alignment, profile, and cross section 
in the intersection area, therefore, should be consistent with those on the approaching 
highways, even though this may be difficult to attain. The presence of the structure itself 
is somewhat of an obstruction, which should not be augmented by inconsistent designs 
that might encourage undesirable driver behaviour. Preferably, the geometric design at 
the highway grade separation should be better than that for the approaching highways 
to counterbalance any possible sense of restriction caused by abutments, piers, curbs 
and rails. 
A grade separation without interchange ramps may be provided to avoid having interchanges 
so close to each other that signing and operation would be difficult. This approach eliminates 
interference with large major road interchanges and increases safety and mobility by 
concentrating turning traffic at a few points where it is feasible to provide adequate ramp 
systems. On the other hand, undue concentration of turning movements at one location 
should be avoided where it would be better to have additional interchanges.
	
•	
Lacking a suitable relocation plan for the crossroad, a highway grade 
separation without ramps may be provided to maintain connectivity of low 
volume roadways. All users desiring to access one facility from the other are 
required to use other existing routes. In some instances, these users may 
have to travel a considerable distance, particularly in rural areas.
	
•	
Many times, partial interchanges are constructed initially because the traffic 
volumes do not support a full interchange or the required right-of-way is not 
available when the interchange is first constructed. As time passes however, 
the need for a complete interchange may develop or the right-of-way may be 
obtained. 
Following Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 can act as guiding principles for assessing the feasibility 
of complete interchanges along urban and rural corridors respectively.

Selection of the most appropriate type of interchange for the prevailing conditions is an 
important step in design. The specific form or type of interchange will depend on the physical 
conditions of the site such as topography, available right-of-way, land-use and developments 
alongside the intersecting roads, expected volumes of through and turning traffic including 
their composition, orientation of the intersecting highways, etc.
8.1	
Study of the Physical Conditions of the Site should Include:
	
(i)	
The topography – this will bring out the roadway that can be made to flyover 
or run in a subway as also the pattern and possible location of the ramps for 
maximum economy. 
	
(ii)	
Location, alignment and design features of the intersecting highways — this 
will help to identify or distinguish the major highway where free flow type 
ramp terminals may be necessary. On a highway with frequent at-grade 
intersections, the ramp terminals should also be at-grade. Similarly, terminals 
on highways carrying more than 10 per cent slow traffic (i.e. carts, bicycles, 
etc.) should be at grade.
	
(iii)	 Roadside developments — the design should be conducive to provide 
access to roadside properties and connection to existing access roads. This 
may call for construction of frontage road or collector roads with connection 
to the highway at appropriate points.
	
(iv)	 Practicability of maintaining traffic during construction — this is important 
where the intersecting roads are existing roads. When the fly-over structure is 
under construction, it should be possible to provide for at-grade connections 
to all traffic movements.
	
(v)	
Flexibility for future adjustment and stage development — this should include 
a study of the design vis-a-vis the planned developments in the adjoining 
area, augmentation of services and other improvements.
8.2	
Lane Balance
To realize efficient traffic operation through and beyond an interchange, there should 
be a balance in the number of traffic lanes on the expressway and ramps. Design traffic 
volumes and a capacity analysis determine the basic number of lanes to be used on the 
highway and the minimum number of lanes on the ramps. The basic number of lanes 
should be established for a substantial length of expressway and should not be changed 
through pairs of interchanges, simply because there are substantial volumes of traffic 
entering and leaving the expressway. In other words, there should be continuity in the 
basic number of lanes. 
After the basic number of lanes is determined for each roadway, the balance in the number 
of lanes should be checked on the basis of the following principles:



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
32
	
(i)	
At entrances, the number of lanes beyond the merging of two traffic streams 
should not be less than the sum of all traffic lanes on the merging roadways 
minus one, but may be equal to the sum of all traffic lanes on the merging 
roadway.
	
(ii)	
At exits, the number of diverging lanes on the highway should be equal to 
the number of lanes on the highway beyond the exit, plus the number of 
lanes on the exit, minus one. Exceptions to this principle occur at cloverleaf 
loop-ramp exits that follow a loop-ramp entrance and at exits between 
closely spaced interchanges. In these cases, the auxiliary lane may be 
dropped in a single-lane exit with the number of lanes on the approach 
roadway being equal to the number of through lanes beyond the exit plus 
the lane on the exit. 
	
(iii)	 The travel way of the highway should be reduced by not more than one traffic 
lane at a time.
Typical examples of lane balance are shown in Fig. 8.1.

9 Safety Considerations for Non-Motorized Transport (NMT)
Integration of bicycles into multi-modal transport chains, particularly with public transport (PT) 
modes, contributes to a more efficient and environmentally sustainable transport system. A 
well-integrated bus-bike system increases bus ridership levels. The common safety issues 
for an NMT network are:
	
•	
Insufficient Lighting 
	
•	
Lengthy crossing distances
	
•	
Discontinuous facilities
	
•	
Unmarked crossings
	
•	
Free-flowing entry and exit ramps 
	
•	
Poor sight distance
	
•	
Insufficient Space
The factors of safety considerations of an NMT network in an interchange are:
9.1	
Sight lines
Crossings (including driveways) are the most likely place for car-bicycle collisions. Crossings 
should be carefully designed to reduce the chance of conflict. Driveways should have adequate 
sight lines to see all traffic on the road. Cycle lanes at intersections and cycle paths where they 
connect with streets should be carefully designed. Intersections with expressways should be 
grade-separated. Fig. 9.1 presents the NMT lane change at exit point of interchange. 
Fig. 9.1 NMT Lane Changing Pattern at the Interchange Exit Lane
9.2	
Vertical Separation
The facilities for NMT are to be vertically separated from motor vehicle traffic. When a raised 
and curb-separated bicycle facility is applied, it is considered part of the street side zone. 
When the raised and curb-separated bike facility is placed adjacent to motor vehicle traffic, 
consider using a sloped and mountable curb to enable passing manoeuvres between cyclists. 
The layout of vertical separation is presented in Fig. 9.2.

Horizontal Separation
The dedicated lanes for cyclists and other NMT modes separated or unseparated reduce 
safety concerns to a considerable level due to zero collision tolerances. The layout of horizontal 
separation is presented in Fig. 9.3. Fig. 9.4 shows dedicated bicycle and pedestrian lanes 
provided for interchange at Vancouver, Canada. Fig. 9.5 presents dedicated NMT facilities 
and NMT facilities under the flyover.

Interchange at Vancouver, Canada
9.4	
Collision Control
Safety is generally about minimizing or managing conflict between users of a carriageway 
(whether this is a road or an off-road situation) and needs to consider the design users: age, 
experience, type of trips and the built environment. This is one reason why the range of users 
needs to be considered explicitly in infrastructure design. Safety is also about designing for 
mode dynamics independently of the interaction between users.
9.5	
Priority in Traffic
Wherever the points of traffic controls are provided within an interchange, the priority and 
exclusive green given to the cyclists and other NMT modes can reduce the safety concerns 
with respect to the head-on collisions.

10 Multimodal consideration 
Multimodal integration helps for accommodating pedestrians, bicyclists, transit, and heavy 
vehicles at interchange. Benefits of integrating multiple modes at an interchange are:
	
•	
Reduced overall right-of-way footprint compared to a conventional diamond 
interchange 
	
•	
Two-phase traffic signal control with reduced pedestrian wait time 
	
•	
Minimized crossing distances 
	
•	
Simplification of conflicts to one-directional vehicular traffic 
	
•	
Opportunities for bicycle lanes and multi-use paths through the interchange 
Some of the strategic components for multimodal integration at traffic interchange are:
10.1	
Right-of-Way
Right-of-way constraints may limit a designer’s ability to provide safe movement of vehicles 
through the crossover or limit the use of alternative design configurations.
10.2	
Access Management
Access near an interchange needs to be restricted based on local and state requirements for 
intersection spacing.
10.3	
Design Vehicles
The interchange geometry will need to accommodate transit, emergency vehicles, freight, 
and potentially oversize and overweight (OSOW) vehicles.
10.4	
Pedestrian and Bicycle Accommodation through Interchanges
The pedestrian and bicycle accommodation, such as sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and shoulders, 
on the minor road should be maintained through the interchange area. If pedestrian and 
bicycle use is permitted on both roadways, then this principle applies to both facilities.
A fundamental obstacle in developing a traffic interchange form is deciding how to provide 
for pedestrian and bicycle movements. Some of the challenges for multimodal provisions are 
uncontrolled turn lanes, some of unfamiliar signal phases etc. The integration of bicycle and 
pedestrian movements is done by anticipating the desire lines from origin and destination 
for these modes. Interchanges and other locations with on-ramps and off-ramps can be 
among the most difficult locations for pedestrians and bicycles to navigate. The combination 
of high speed merging traffic and crossings by pedestrians and bicyclists creates inherent 
conflicts and can be very uncomfortable for non-motorized users. Particularly in urban and 



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
37
sub-urban locations where pedestrian and bicycle traffic can be expected to use the roadway, 
interchange design should account for their needs. 
The most important principle in designing interchanges that accommodate pedestrians and 
bicyclists is to reduce motor vehicle speeds at locations where pedestrians and bicyclists 
either cross the road, or (as in the case with bicyclists operating on-road) merge with traffic. 
For this reason, urban interchange design with conventional 90-degree intersections (instead 
of merge lanes) is preferable for pedestrian and bicycle safety. Interchange designs that 
enable motor vehicles to maintain speeds above 50 kmph without stopping are not conducive 
to pedestrian and bicycle access and should be avoided. 
10.5	
Transit Considerations
Transit can be accommodated in interchanges by providing the bus stops on the interchanges 
and the passengers which get down on the interchanges should be integrated safely, so that 
they can safely go out of the interchange or interchanging to the different modes. So, the 
bus stops should be provided along with the bus lanes and lay bys, so that the stopping 
of the transit vehicles do not create any congestion on the grade separated interchange. 
Sometimes the angles for left turn slip lanes are tightened to 550 to 600 which lead to slower 
vehicle speeds and creates good visibility to the passengers.
Fig. 10.1 Integration of Pedestrians at Mukarba Chowk Flyover using Elevators and Ramps
11 Illumination at interchange
An interchange, particularly a complicated one, demands from the driver much more skill and 
concentration due to continuous change of situations, where it is slowing down at the exit 
ramps or negotiating the sharp curvatures. In such circumstances visual contact and psycho-
physiological conditions are considerably more involved compared with routine driving on 
a straight road section. More precise and higher quality visual information can be of great 
importance in meeting the critical needs of such a situation. Thus, lighting at interchanges 
helps to identify the physical features of the interchange at night and to provide a safe and 
efficient operational environment. 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
38
For details on illumination, reference may be made to IRC:SP:90 “Manual for Grade Separators 
& Elevated Structures”. Fig. 11.1 shows a visual perception of illumination at interchange.
Fig. 11.1 Visual Perception of Illumination at Interchange
For the sake of uniform illumination levels for Non-Motorized Transport, following suggestions 
shall be considered:
	
•	
The street and footpath or cycle track may be considered together as one 
element in determining minimum light level and uniformity.
	
•	
The contribution of both the pedestrian lighting system and the road lighting 
system may be considered for calculating light levels and uniformity of the 
sidewalk or bikeway and the roadway.
	
•	
Road lighting may be existing or may be added with the pedestrian lighting
	
•	
It may be a part of the same lighting system or a separate lighting system.
	
•	
The reduction of veiling glare is beneficial.
	
•	
Veiling glare observed by a motorist is mitigated by increasing the luminance 
of the roadway.
12 Noise Pollution Barriers
Noise barriers are used as an effective measure of noise abatement. Different types of “green” 
noise barriers adapted to the surrounding environment are used. Size and conspicuousness 
of noise barriers and noise embankments leaves their mark on the environment. An increasing 
proportion of people’s time is spent commuting on highways, and it is therefore an important 
task to make this time a positive experience through attractive surroundings. Noise screening 
can constitute an actual physical barrier in a town or housing area. Following principles shall 
be adhered with while considering noise controlling measures along traffic interchanges: 
	
•	
Planting of trees and other vegetation so that the noise barrier fits in with its 
surroundings.



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:92-2017
39
	
•	
To allow the noise barrier to bring out the lines and forms of the landscape or 
town to the roadside.
	
•	
Make the noise barrier stand out as a striking and visible addition to its 
surroundings through a conscious selection of colours and forms.
	
•	
Noise barriers constructed could be of different materials, such as steel, 
brick, concrete, wood and transparent materials. 
	
•	
The height of a noise screening installation is also important for road users 
and their possibilities of orientation in the urban area or landscape through 
which they are passing. Even the erection of a 1.5 m high barrier affects 
visibility conditions for motorists.

13 Landscaping at Interchange
The unused voids and land shall be utilized for landscaping around the interchange. 
Landscaping features not only improve the aesthetics but also help in reduction of noise 
and air pollution, improving microclimate, better heat and light entropy. Although, in general, 
landscaping improves the overall user experience at interchange but it should never hinder the 
functioning of interchange. For example, visibility at interchange shall always be maintained 
and unwanted vegetation shall be trimmed. Similarly, only compatible and suitable vegetation 
shall be developed. The two aspects discussed are: Planting & Shade.
13.1	
Planting
Planting in interchanges should be done as part of a comprehensive landscape and aesthetics 
plan. The design of the planting must be done so that it achieves the aesthetic goals for the 
specific corridor and facilitates maintenance of the interchange.
	
•	
Planting is most effective in areas of low slope. Planting on the slopes is 
difficult to maintain and will shade out grass cover, which leads to erosion.
	
•	
Planting is most effective when placed in the driver’s line of sight and where 
the background is either sky or light-colored structures.

13.2	
Shade
Design solutions must be sensitive to deeply shaded areas and areas that are difficult to 
access.
	
•	
Bridges and tall embankments will shade areas of an interchange, making the 
establishment of a vegetative cover nearly impossible. These areas should 
be either eliminated structurally using walls, or surfaced with an appropriate 
non-living material.
	
•	
Shaded areas tend to collect debris, attract graffiti, and are sometimes 
occupied by transients. These areas should be eliminated structurally if 
possible. When this is not possible, the views should remain open to allow 
visual policing.
A paved surface is a better solution than plants where shade from structures prevents 
vegetation establishment.

Gores
Gore areas between ramps and weaving lanes often contain crash attenuation barriers 
that are not particularly attractive. The triangular area between the diverging lanes tends to 
accumulate trash. Design actions appropriate in these areas are:
	
•	
Use colors on pavement that contrast sharply with the driving lane pavement.
	
•	
Avoid rough textures that will trap and hold trash and debris.
	
•	
Group signs to provide a uniform horizon even if the signs are of different 
dimensions; such groupings contribute a sense of visual order.
For more details on clearances, reference may be made to IRC:SP:21 “Guidelines on 
Landscaping and Tree Plantation”.

14 Drainage at Interchange
Drainage at road systems and especially at interchanges is a crucial component of planning and 
design of the facility. The reasons to provide a sound and long-lasting drainage system are:
	
•	
To prevent flooding of the road and ponding on the road surface.
	
•	
To protect the bearing capacity of the pavement and the sub grade material.
	
•	
To avoid the erosion of side slopes.
For more details on drainage, reference may be made to IRC:SP:42 “Guidelines of Road 
Drainage” and IRC:SP:50 “Guidelines on Urban Drainage”.
15 Signage and Markings
Suitable road marking and signage shall be posted at convenient and suitable locations to 
safeguard uninterrupted traffic. The signage may be provided as per the guidelines given in 
IRC:67 “Code of Practice for Road Signs”.
List of some of the essential markings and signage include –
	
•	
Directions
	
•	
Road side facilities
	
•	
Speed limits
	
•	
Lane marking and usage
	
•	
Overtaking and turning restrictions (if applicable)
	
•	
Pedestrian and cycle path (Along and Across)
	
•	
Gore area and chevron treatment
	
•	
Carriage shyness and travelled way reflectors
	
•	
Emergency provisions and contacts
16 Construction and Maintenance 
Projects are planned and carried out using a sequence of activities commonly referred 
to as the project cycle. There are many ways of defining the steps in the sequence but 
the following terminologies in road projects are commonly used: - identification, feasibility 
study and preliminary design, detailed engineering design, commitments and procurement, 
construction supervision and management, operation and project monitoring evaluation. 
Details on construction, maintenance and inspection to be referred in IRC:SP:90 “Manual for 
Grade Separators & Elevated Structures”.
