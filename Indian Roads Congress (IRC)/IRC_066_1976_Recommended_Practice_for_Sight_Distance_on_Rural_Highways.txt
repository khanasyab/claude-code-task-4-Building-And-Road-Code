RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR SIGHT DISTANCE
ON RURAL HIGHWAYS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Ability to see ahead
is of profound
importance
for the
safe and efficient
operation of
vehicles
on a highway.
If
greater
safety
is to be built into highway alignments, the design must ensure
sight distance of adequate
length in
different
situations
to
permit
drivers enough time and distance
to
control their
vehicles
so as to
avoid unforeseen accidents.
1.2.
In 1950, the Specifications and Standards Committee had
published a Paper on sight distances (Paper No.
149, "Standards for
Sight Distances for Highways",
IRC
Journal Vol. XV-1) which has
remained the
mainstay of
highway
practice in
the country so far.
There have been significant developments since then.
Taking these
into account; revised
recommendations
on this
subject
have been
evolved for uniform
adoption on all
rural
highways.
The
present
Recommended
Practice was
approved
by the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee in their
meeting
held on the
12th
and 13th
December,
1975
subject to a
few
modifications and
later
it was
approved by the Executive Committee in
their meeting
held on the
14th April 1976 and by the
Council in their 87th
meeting held
on
27th August 1976.
1.3.
In applying this
standard,
effort should
not be
to limit
the design of any highway to the minimum values laid down. Where
conditions are
favourable,
good
engineering
practice
will
lie
in
adopting
more
liberal
values,
particularly
for
stopping
sight
distance.
2.
STOPPING SIGHT DISTANCE
2.1.
General
2.1.1.
Stopping sight distance
is the minimum
sight distance
for which all roads must always be designed, regardless of any other
consideration.
It
is the clear distance ahead
needed by a driver to
stop his vehicle before meeting a stationary object in his path on the
road.
1



======================================================================
PAGE 6 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 66-1976
2.1.2.
Stopping distance has two components:
(i) the distance travelled
during perception
and brake
reaction
time;
and
(ii)
the distance travelled during the time
brakes are under
application
till the vehicle comes to a stop.
2.2.
Perception and Brake Reaction Time
2.2.1.
Perception and brake reaction time
is the time interval
between the instant the driver sights a dangerous object for which a
stop
is necessary and the instant the brakes are applied.
2.2.2.
Perception
and
brake
reaction
time
depends
on a
variety of factors, viz., age, sex,
alertness
and
visual
acuity of the
driver, atmospheric visibility, vehicle design, the size and type of the
object etc.
For purposes of
highway
design,
the
total
reaction
time should be large enough to cover nearly all drivers and highway
conditions.
A value of
2.5
seconds is
considered
reasonable
for
most situations.
The
distance
travelied
during this time
will be
given by the expression:
Ji=0.278 Vt
where
di= distance travelled during total reaction time in metres;
K=speed in kmph; and
r= the perception and reaction
time in seconds.
2.3.
Braking Distance
2.3.1.
Braking distance is the
distance
required a
vehicle to
come to stop after the brakes are applied.
On a level
road, assum-
ing friction remains constant duiing the period of deceleration, brak-
ing distance
is given by:
a"~
"254/
where
d2=
braking distance in metres;
V—
speed in kmph; and
/=
coefficient of
longitudinal
friction
between vehi-
cle tyres and road pavement.
2.3.2.
The value of the
coefficient
of
friction
varies
with
speed, tyre pressure, condition of tyre
tread, type and
condition of
pavement, and whether the surface
is
wet or dry.
For design pur-
poses, the value should
encompass
nearly all
significant pavement
2

surface types and
field conditions,
and
should be safe
for tyres in
reasonable condition.
Based on these considerations, design values
for
coefficient of
friction at
different
vehicle
speeds are
given
in
Table

Design Values
2.4.1.
Minimum stopping
sight distance
is given by the sum
of the
components di
and d2
discussed in
preceding paragraphs.
Calculated and rounded
values
of stopping
distance
for
different
vehicle speeds are given
in
Table
1. For
application of values
in
this table, the speed chosen should be the same as the design
speed
of the road.
2.5.
Effect of Grade
2.5.1.
The braking distance
of
a
vehicle
is longer on down-
grades
and
shorter
on
upgrades.
The
braking
distance formula
amended to take the effect of grades into
account is
:
*"
254 (/±0.01G)
in which G
is the longitudinal grade in per cent (positive for upgrade
and negative
for
downgrade)
and
other
terms
are
the same as
previously defined.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 8 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 66-1976
2.5.2.
Correction for grade should not be applied
on
undivi-
ded roads with two way
traffic, but
must
invariably
be
considered
for divided highways which have independently designed profiles.
2.6. Criterion for Measurement
Safe stopping
sight
distance
is measured between two
points,
one 1.2 m above the carriageway standing for in driver's eye and the
other 0.15 m height representing the object.
3.
OVERTAKING SIGHT DISTANCE
3.1.
Design Criteria
3.1.1.
For a higher level of service on
undivided
roads,
it
is
necessary that vehicles moving at design
speed should be frequently
able
to
overtake
vehicles
slower
than
them.
Since
overtaking
manoeuvre involves the occupation of
road space normally used by
opposing traffic, drivers must have sufficient
sight
distance available
to them so that the whole operation can be accomplished with safety.
Optimum condition
is one in which the overtaking driver can follow
the vehicle ahead for a short time while he assesses
his
chances
of
overtaking, pull out, overtake, and return to his own side of the road
before meeting any
oncoming vehicle.
3.1.2.
In actual practice, there may be
occasions to consider
multiple overtakings where two or more vehicles
overtake
another
vehicle, or are
themselves
overtaken
in a single manoeuvre.
It
is,
however, not practical to assume such conditions in developing mini-
mum sight distance
criteria.
Sight
distance
values recommended
here
pertain
basically
to
overtaking
manoeuvres
involving single
vehicles.
Longer sight distances are generally
available along road
alignments, e.g., in long relatively level sections, where an occasional
multiple overtaking can take place without
difficulty.
3.1.3.
For
computing minimum
overtaking
sight
distance,
certain assumptions for traffic behaviour are necessary.
The assum-
ptions made are
:
(i)
The vehicle being overtaking is travelling at a uniform speed which
is 16
km per hour less than the design speed of the road
;
(ii)
The
overtaking
vehicle
follows
the vehicle ahead for a short while to
perceive
the
clear
road
ahead
before
beginning
the
overtaking
movement;
(iii)
Overtaking is done by accelerating
rapidly
to
the
design speed and
is
regarded as having been completed when the overtaking vehicle returns
to its own side of the road
; and
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 66-1976
(iv)
Overtaking once begun
is
finished
in
the face of an oncoming vehicle
travelling at design speed in such a way
that the latter arrives alongside
the former just at the completion of the manoeuvre.
3.1.4.
Observations in the U.S.A. and
elsewhere have shown
that the overtaking manoeuvre
takes
roughly
8 to 14 seconds for a
vehicle closing at
the
design
speed.
To this should
be added
the
distance travelled by an opposing vehicle during
the time of overta-
king manoeuvre to minimise the chance of a collision while the over-
taking
vehicle
is
on
right-hand side
of the road.
Conservatively,
this distance should be the distance traversed by an opposing vehicle
during the entire time of the overtaking manoeuvre.
But this makes
the overtaking distance too long and
is
seriously
open
to question.
During the first
phase
of
the
overtaking
manoeuvre
when
the
overtaking
vehicle
has
not
yet
pulled
abreast
of
the
vehicle
being
overtaken,
the
former
can
always
return
to its
own
side
if an
oncoming
vehicle
is
sighted.
The interval of the
first
phase manoeuvre
is about one-third the total time required for over-
taking.
On this basis, the element in the
overtaking sight distance
for the opposing vehicle can be reasonably
taken
to be the distance
it traverses during two-thirds of the actual time for overtaking.
The
opposing
vehicle
is
assumed
to
travel
at design speed during this
period.
3.2.
Design Values for Overtaking Sight Distance
3.2.1.
Using
the
above
assumptions,
safe
overtaking
sight
distances for different speeds have
been
calculated
in
Table 2 and
rounded off values are given for design purposes.

3.2.2
The design values in
Table 2 pertain to overtaking of a
vehicle by a passenger car at level
grade.
On
upgrades,
the
sight
distance required would be more due to reduced
acceleration of the
overtaking vehicle and the likely
speeding up
of
the
vehicle from
opposing direction.
These factors
are somewhat
compensated
by
the loss in speed of the overtaken vehicle
which
may frequently be
a heavy truck.
No separate design values are, therefore, recommen-
ded for application on grades.
3.3.
Application
3.3.1.
On single carriageways with two-way traffic (i.e., undi-
vided
roads
of
single
or
two-lane
width),
normally the attempt
should be to provide overtaking sight
distance
in as much length of
the road as possible.
Conditions ideal for this
application will be
(i)
straight
sections
of road with
isolated overbridges or summit vertical
curves where the provision of overtaking sight
distance would result in
unobstructed sight distance over a long length of the road; and
(ii)
relatively
easy
sections
of
terrain
adjacent
to
long
reaches with no
opportunity
for
overtaking
at
all,
e.g., at
the
ends of an excessively
winding road in hilly/rolling country.
3.3.2.
In sections where
application
of
overtaking sight dis-
tance
is considered impractical for
reasons
of economics or other-
wise, as in an undulating terrain, as far as feasible the design should
aim at providing the intermediate sight distance discussed in para
4.
Where visibility corresponds to these
conditions,
drivers
should be
cautioned
about
the
limited
sight distance for overtaking through
appropriate speed limit signs.
The posted
speed
should be that at
which the overtaking manoeuvre can be completed
with
full safety,
vide Table 2.
3.3.3.
At summit curves and
horiozntal curves not
satisfying
requirements
of even
the
intermediate
sight
distance,
it will
be
necessary
to
provide
restrictive
pavement markings in accordance
with IRC
: 35-1970 "Code of Practice
for
Road
Markings
(with
paints)".
Where the road section involved
is long, "No Overtaking"
signs should be installed at the beginning and at intervals.
3.4.
Criterion for Measurement
Overtaking
sight
distances
is
measured between two points
both
1.2 metre above the carriageway, one
standing
for
the driver
eye
height
and
the
other
for
the height of object above the road
surface.

INTERMEDIATE SIGHT DISTANCE
4.1.
Design Values
4.1.1.
Sections
of
roads
where
the
customary
overtaking
sight
distance
cannot
be
provided
should
be
designed,
as far as
possible, for "intermediate sight distance"
which
is defined as twice
the normal safe stopping distance.
It is the
experience that
inter-
mediate sight distance improves visibility appreciably
and
affords a
reasonable chance to drivers to overtake with caution.
4.1.2.
Recommended
values
of
intermediate

5.
HEADLIGHT SIGHT DISTANCE AT VALLEY CURVES
5.1.
During day time, visibility
is hardly
a problem on valley
curves.
But for night travel the design must
ensure
that the road-
7



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 66-1976
way ahead
is illuminated by vehicle headlights for a sufficient length
which enables the vehicle to brake to
a
stop,
if necessary.
This
is
known as the headlight sight distance and
is
equal to the safe stop-
ping sight distance given in Table
1.
From
safety
considerations,
it is essential that valley curves should be
designed
to
provide
for
this visibility.
5.2.
Criterion for Measurement
For designing valley curves,
the
following
criteria
should be
followed to ensure the headlight sight distance
:
(i)
height of headlight above the road surface
is 0.75 m;
(ii)
the
useful beam
of headlight
is one
degree upwards from the grade of
the road; and
(iii)
the height of object is nil.
6.
SIGHT DISTANCE FOR DIVIDED HIGHWAYS
6.1.
On
divided
highways
with
4
or
more lanes, it is not
necessary to provide overtaking sight distance as
required for single
carriageways with-two-way traffic.
However, sight distance adequ-
ate for
safe
stopping
for
the
design
speed
vide Table
1 must be
ensured at all points along the
highway.
In fact
it
will
be a good
practice to design for somewhat more liberal
values
to
make
allo-
wance for the time a driver
takes
to
recognise
whether
a
vehicle
ahead has stopped and, if it has, whether
it
is on the carriageway
or
the shoulder.
7.
SIGHT DISTANCE ON HORIZONTAL CURVES
7.1.
Sight distance across the inside of horizontal curves is an
important element of design.
Lack of visibility
in the lateral direc-
tion may arise due to obstructions like walls, cut
slopes,
buildings,
wooded areas, high farm crops etc.
The straightforward
manner of
achieving the
necessary
setback in these situations
is to remove the
obstruction.
If somehow this is not
feasible, alignment of the road
may need adjustments.
Preferably each such case should be studied
separately to determine the best course to adopt.
7.2.
The setback
distance to give
the desired
sight distance
on the inside of
horizontal
curves
can
be calculated
from
the
8



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 66-1976
following equation (see Fig.
1
for definitions):
m=R—(R—n) Cos 0
where 0=
=
r- radians
/?7 = the minimum
setback distance to sight obstruction
in metres at the middle
of
the
curve
(measured
from the centre
line of the road);
i?=radius at the centre line of the road in metres
n= distance
between
the
centre line of the road and
the centre line of the inside lane in metres;
and 5'=sight distance in metres.
In the above equation,
sight distance
is measured
along the middle
of
inner
lane.
On
narrow,
single-lane
roads, this refinement
is
not necessary and the setback distance
should
be
provided
with
respect
to
the
centre-line
of
the
road,
i.e., assuming *«'
to be
zero.

Utilising
the
above
equation, design charts for lateral
clearance corresponding to the
safe stopping distance are
given in
Fig. 2 for
two-lane
roads.
The plotted
values relate
basically to
circular curves longer than the design
sight distance.
For
shorter
curves,
the
values
of
setback
distance found from Fig. 2 will be
somewhat on the
higher side, but these
can any
way be used as a
guide.

7.4.
Lateral
clearance
for
overtaking
or
intermediate sight
distance could be computed similarly.
Calculations would, however,
reveal that the setback distance
required will usually be too large to
be economically feasible except on very flat curves.
7.5.
When there
is a cut
slope on the inside of the horizontal
curve, a practical
consideration in providing
the setback distance is
the average
height of sight line above
the ground level.
For stop-
ping sight distance, the average height can
be
assumed
as
0.7 m
since
the
height
criteria are 1.2 m for the eye and 0.15 m for the
object.
Cut slopes should be kept clear above
this
height
at
the
midpoint of the sight line by cutting back the slope or benching.
In
the case of meeting or overtaking sight
distance, height of sight line
above the ground would be 1.2 metre.
7.6.
Where a horizontal
and summit vertical
curve overlap,
the line of sight will not be over the top of the crest but to one side,
and in part may be
off the roadway.
Design in such
cases should
provide for the required sight
distance both in the vertical direction
along the pavement and in the horizontal
direction on the inside of
the curve.

required sight distance should receive
care right from early stages when the alignment of a highway
is still
flexible
and subject
to adjustments.
Quick appraisals are best had
by graphical means.
By determining the
available
sight
distance
graphically
from
plans
and
profile
drawings, and recording
it at
convenient intervals, deficiencies in visibility
can
be
detected
in
time so that necessary
modifications could
be made before detailed
design.
8.2. Horizontal sight distances can be directly scaled from plans
on which obstructions to visibility such as buildings, plantation,
hill
slopes etc.,
have been
marked. The measurement
is done with the
help of a straight edge.
8.3.
Measurement of vertical sight may be
done from plotted
profiles of
the highway.
A transparent straight
edge with parallel
edges 1.2 m apart and a dotted line
0.15 m from the
upper edge as
per the vertical scale of the profile
is the
tool employed
for
these
measurements.
The
transparent
strip is placed on the profile with
the lower edge at the station
for which
available sight
distance
is
desired and the strip revolved about this point
till
the
upper
edge
touches
the
profile.
Stopping
sight distance available
is then the

distance between the
first station and the point of intersection of the
dotted
line
with
the
profile.
Overtaking and
intermediate sight
distances will be the distance between the
initial
station
and
the
point where the lower edge of the strip meets the profile.
8.4.
The horizontal
and vertical sight
distance whichever
is
smaller should be recorded on the
plan—L section
drawings.
The
available sight distance for stopping and overtaking should be shown
in two separate columns below the
profile drawing.
Such
records
take
up
very
little
space
on the drawings but are invaluable for
highway design.
These can also be used for
fixing
boundaries
of
the no-passing zones.

SIGHT DISTANCE AT INTERSECTIONS
9.1.
General
9.1.1.
Visibility
is an
important requirement at intersections.
To avoid collisions,
it
is essential
that
sufficient
sight
distance
is
available along the intersecting roads
and their included corners, to
enable the operators
of
vehicles
simultaneously
approaching
the
intersection to see each other in time.
9.1.2.
At-grade intersections can
be broadly
grouped
under
two headings:
(i) 'Uncontrolled intersections' where the intersecting roads are of more
or
less equal importance and there is no established priority;
(ii) 'Priority
intersections', like
minor-major road intersections, where one
road takes virtual precedence over the other.
Traffic on the minor road
may
be
controlled
by
STOP
on GIVE WAY signs/road markings,
making
it clear that the other road has the priority.
9.2.
Uncontrolled Intersections
9.2.1.
At these intersections,
visibility should be provided on
the principle that the drivers of
vehicles on either highway are able
to sight the
intersection and the
intersecting highway in good time
to be able to halt their vehicles
if that becomes essential. The area for
clear
visibility
should
be determined with respect to the stopping
sight distance for each highway corresponding to the
design
speed,
Table
1.
9.2.2.
Minimum
sight
triangles
in
the included corners of
uncontrolled intersections, which must be kept
free of all
obstruc-
tions to sight, could be demarcated as
illustrated in Fig.
3.
If visi-
bility conditions
upto this standard are ensured,
drivers of vehicles
will be able
to either stop or
adjust their
speed in
the event of a
dangerous situation ahead.

9.2.3.
Occasionally, the size of the sight triangle available may
be less than the
desirable minimum due
to presence of an obstruc-
tion which cannot be removed except at prohibitive
cost.
In
such
circumstances, the
vehicles must be appropriately warned to travel
at speeds corresponding to the available sight distance
and
not
at
the
design
speed
of the highway.
One solution can be to permit
vehicles on one of the roads to travel at the design speed and evalu-
ate the corresponding critical
speed for the other road which might
be posted.
Alternatively, the approach speed
for
both
the
roads
could be restricted in accordance with the sight triangle available by
installing suitable speed limit signs.

9.3.
Priority Intersections
9.3.1.
On
priority intersections, the visibility provided should
be such that drivers
approaching from
the minor road
are able to
see vehicles on the major road inadequate time.and to judge whether
the required gap is available in
the main road
traffic stream
for a
safe crossing so that the vehicle could be brought to a halt, if neces-
sary. For this purpose, a minimum
visibility distance of 15 m along
the minor road
is recommended.

9.3.2.
Visibility
distance
along
the major road depends on
the time required by the driver on the minor road
to
perceive
the
traffic conditions on the intersection, evaluate the gaps in the vehicle
stream, take a
decision about actual
crossing, and finally to accele-
rate the vehicle to complete the manoeuvre. The total time required
for these operations may be taken
as 8 seconds.
On this basis, the
sight triangle at priority intersections should be formed by measuring
15 m along the minor road and a
distance
along
the
major
road
equal to 8 seconds
travel at the design
speed.
This
is illustrated in
Fig.
4.
Visibility
distances
(rounded values)
corresponding to 8
seconds travel time are set out in Table 4.
