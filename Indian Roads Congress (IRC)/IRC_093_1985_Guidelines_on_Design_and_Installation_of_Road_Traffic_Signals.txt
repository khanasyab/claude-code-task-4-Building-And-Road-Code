aided as the
problem
is extremely complex
because of crossing of several routes at common intersections.

TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF ROAD TRAFFIC SIGNALS
1.
GREEN SIGNAL
All permitted traffic
movements,
shall be indicated by green
arrows.
The arrows shall be stencil cut, and pointing in the direc-
tion in which traffic movement is permitted.
Traffic except
pedes-
trians, facing a GREEN ARROW, may cautiously enter the interse-
ction only
to
make
the
movement
indicated
by such arrow or
arrows shown at the same time.
2.
STEADY AMBER SIGNAL
Traffic
facing
a steady
circular
amber
signal indication
is
thereby warned that a related green movement is being terminated
or that a red indication will
be
immediately exhibited, thereafter
the vehicular traffic shall not
enter
the
intersection. The
vehicle
operator must be in readiness to accept
an
impending change,
in
right-of-way assignments.
The amber interval
is a transition inter-
val between termination of related green movement and
exhibition
of a red indication or between termination of a red
indication
and
commencement of related green movement.
In the first case,
it is
called 'Clearance Amber' and in the second case, it
is called 'Initial
Amber'.
A clearance amber shall be provided between the termination
of a green arrow indication and
the showing of a
green indication
to any conflicting traffic movement.
3.
STEADY RED SIGNAL
Traffic facing a steady circular RED SIGNAL shall stop at a
clearly
marked
stop
line, before
entering the cross-walk on the
near side
of the
intersection
or if none,
then before entering the
intersection and shall remain
standing
until an
indication to pro-
ceed
is shown.
4.
FLASHING SIGNAL
4.1.
Flashing Red (Stop Signal)
When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of
vehicles
shall stop at a
clearly
marked stop line, but
if none, then before
the cross-walk on the near
side
of
the
inte-
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: 93-1985
rsecting roadway where the driver
has a
view of the
approaching
traffic on the intersecting roadway prior to entering the intersection.
The right to proceed shall
be subject to
availability of safe gap in
the cross-traffic stream.
4.2.
Flashing Amber (Caution Signal)
When an amber
lens
is illuminated
with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of
vehicles may
proceed through the intersection
or pass such signal only, with caution.
When an amber
arrow
is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers may proceed in the direction indicated by the arrow,
with caution.
5.
PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL
5.1.
Movements
of
pedestrians
shall
be
controlled with
separate pedestrian signal heads.
5.2.
Pedestrians facing a steady green with human
figure in
readiness
to
move, may
proceed
across the roadway within the
marked cross-walk adjacent to the pedestrian signal.
5.3.
Pedestrians facing a steady red with a
standing human
figure, shall not enter the roadway.
5.4.
When
a
flashing
red
with a standing human figure
is
exhibited, those pedestrians already on the carriageway shall quic-
kly proceed to the nearest refuge
island or foot-path and those on
the foot-path or refuge island shall not enter the carriageway.
6.
SIZE AND DESIGN OF SIGNAL LENSES
6.1.
The aspect of all signal lenses shall be circular.
There
shall be two sizes for lenses such
that the net diameter of exposure
towards traffic (after taking into account the hoods, etc.)
is 200 mm
or 300 mm.
Normally, 300 mm
lenses should
be
used
in
the
following cases:
(1) For
intersections
on highways
in suburban area with 85th peicen-
tile approach speeds exceeding 70 kmph.
(2) For intersections
in busy urban area with 85th
percentile approach
speeds exceeding 50 kmph.
(3) For
intersections
with wide
3
lane approaches and other problem
locations
such as those with conflicting
or competing background
lighting
in urban areas.

Arrows on green or amber lenses shall be pointed verti-
cally upward to indicate a straight through movement and in
hori-
zontal
direction
to
indicate
a
turn approximately at right angle.
When the angle
of
a
turn
is
substantially
different from a right
angle, the arrows should be positioned
on
an
upward slope at an
angle approximately equal to that of the turn.
6.3.
Each arrow lens shall
show only one
arrow direction.
The arrow shall be the only illuminated part of the lens visible.
In
special circumstances, the
same lens
may show two-arrow direc-
tions.
6.4.
Except
for
the
requirements of this section
all lenses
shall conform to the standards
of
the I.S.I. 7537-1974.

Standard Specification for Road Traffic Signals").
7.
ARRANGEMENT OF LENSES IN SIGNAL FACES
7.1.
The lenses in a singal face shall be arranged in a vertical
straight line and in a vertical array, lenses of the same colour shall
be arranged horizontally
adjacent
to each other at right angles to
the basic straight line arrangement.
7.2.
In each signal face,
red lens shall be located above all
other lenses.
A
circular
amber
lens shall be located below the
red lens.
Green lens with
straight
arrow shall be placed
below
the circular amber lens.
On
either side
of
this green lens, other
green lenses, with directional
arrows shall be placed in a horizon-
tal straight line, in logical order of the
directional
indications.
If
turns are prohibited at a particular
intersection,
illuminated signs
showing turn prohibitions
shall be displayed in that position where
the lens with the green arrow would have been placed, if that dire-
ctional movement were allowed.
8.
ILLUMINATION OF LENSES
8.1.
Each
signal
lens
shall be
illuminated independently.
When a signal lens except in a pedestrian signal
is illuminated and
the view of such an indication
is
not otherwise
physically obstruc-
ted,
it
shall
be
clearly visible (to drivers
it controls)
from a dist-
ance of at least 400 metre under normal atmospheric conditions.
8.2.
The intensity and distribution of light from each illumi-
nated signal lens should conform to the Standard of I.S.I.
When
the flashes are used, they should not cause excessive glare or
dist-
raction.

9.
VISIBILITY AND SHIELDING OF SIGNAL FACES
9.1.
Each signal face shall be so adjusted that
its indications
will
be
of maximum
effectiveness
to the approaching traffic for
which they are intended.
9.2.
A visor shall be fitted to each of the optical system and
unless otherwise
specified shall be as per IS: 7537-1974.
The
vis-
ors should be dipped at an
angle
of
5
degree ±
3 degree to the
horizontal so as to aid
in directing the signal indication, specifically
to approaching traffic as well
as to reduce
<:Sun phantoms" resul-
ting from external
light entering the lens.
The visors for primary
signals and secondary signals may be different as shown
in, Fig
1.
9.3.
In general,
vehicular
signal
faces should be aimed to
have maximum effectiveness for
an approaching
driver located at
a distance from the stop line equal
to the
distance traversed while
stopping.
This distance should include, that covered while
bring-
ing the vehicle to a stop
from
an
average approach speed.
The
influence of curves, grades and obstructions should be
considered
in directing and locating signals.
9.4.
Irregular
street
design
frequently necessitates placing
signals for different street
approaches, with a comparatively small
angle between their indications.
In such cases, each signal indica-
tion shall to the extent
practicable, be shielded or directed by vis-
ors, louvers
or other means, so
that
approaching
driver can
see
only the indication controlling his movement. Tunnel visors excee-
ding 300 mm length shall not be used in signal aspects.
10.
NUMBER AND LOCATION OF SIGNAL FACES
10.1.
The
primary
consideration
in
signal
face placement
shall be visibility.
Drivers approaching
at
signalised inter-section
or other signalised area, such as a mid-block
cross-walk,
shall
be
given
a
clear
and
unmistakable
indication
of their right-of-way
assignment.
Critical elements are
lateral
and
vertical
angles
of
sight,
towards
a
signal
face,
as determined by typical driver eye
position, vehicle design and
the
vertical
longitudinal
and
lateral
position
of
the
signal face.
The geometry of each intersection to
be
signalised,
including
vertical
grades
and
horizontal
curves,
should be considered in signal face placement.

each approach to an intersection or a midblock cross walk shall
be
as follows
:
(i) A minimum of two signal faces for through traffic shall
be provided
and should be continuously visible from a point at least the distances
given in Table

One of the above mentioned signal faces shall be erected on the near side
of
the
intersection
(called
the
primary) and the other on the far side
(called the secondary).
The primary shall be on
the
near
side
of
the
intersection at the stop line on the left side of the approaching traffic and
the secondary shall be not less than 12 metre nor
greater
than 36
metre
on
the far
side of the intersection but to the right on the footpath or at
the median island, if available.
(ii) Where physical conditions prevent drivers having a
continuous
view
of
atleast
two
signal indications as specified in (i) above a suitable
sign shall be erected in advance
to
warn
the
approaching
traffic.
The specifications
of
the
sign
is
shown
in, Fig. 2.
This may be
supplemented by a hazard identification beacon (Flashing amber).
(iii) Supplementary
signal
faces
should
be
used, when an engineering
study has shown that they are needed to achieve both advance
and
immediate
intersection
visibility.
When used, they should be loca-
ted to provide optimum visibility for the movement to be controlled.

The following 'imitations apply
:
(a) Right turn arrows shall not be used in near-left faces.
(b)
Left turn arrows shall not be used in far-right faces.
A far side median mount signal shall be considered as a
far-right
signal
for this application.
At signalised mid-block cross-walks, there should be at
least
one
signal
face
over
the
travelled road-way for each approach.
In other respects
a traffic control signal at a mid-block location
shall
meet
the
require-
ments set forth in these standards.

H RIGHT OF SIGNAL FACES
11.1.
The
bottom
of
the
housing of a signal face, not sus-
pended over a roadway, shall be at a
height
of
2.5
metre
above
the
footpath
or
if none
above
the pavement grade at the centre
(crown) of the roadway.
14



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: 93-1985
11.2.
The bottom of the housing of a signal face,
suspended
over a roadway, shall be at a height of 5.5 metre above
the
pave-
ment grade at the centre of roadway.
11.3.
Optimum
visibility and adequate clearance
shoul
be
guiding
considerations
in
deciding
signal
height.
Grades
on
approaching
streets may
be
important
factors,
and
should
be
considered in determining the most appropriate height.
However,
the maximum heights of bottom of housing of post-mounted
signal
face
should
not
exceed
4.6 metre and while in the case of
over-
head signal face, the same should not exceed 5.8 metre.
12.
TRANSVERSE LOCATION OF TRAFFIC
SIGNAL SUPPORTS AND CONTROLLER
CABINETS
12.1.
In
the placement of signal supports, primary conside-
ration
shall
be
given
for
ensuring
the proper visibility of signal
faces
as
described
in
section
1 1-8
and
1 1-9.
However,
in
the
interest of safety, signal supports and controller cabinets should
be
placed
as
far
as
practicable
from the edge of the travelled way,
without adversely affecting signal
visibility.
12.2.
Supports
for
post mounted signal heads
at the side of
a
street
with
kerbs
shall
have
a horizontal clearance of not less
than
60 cm
within
the
limits
of normal vertical clearance.
A
signal support should not obstruct a cross-walk.
12.3.
On medians, the above minimum clearances for signal
supports
should
be obtained
where
practicable.
Any
support,
which
cannot
be
located
with the required clearances, should be
of breakaway type or should be guarded as far as practicable.
12.4.
The
transverse
location
of
primary
and
secondary
units
of
signals
on
a
typical
four arm intersection
is shown in,

indicates
clearly
the
minimum
horizontal
distance
of
the
supports from the kerb, their placement with res-
pect to the pedestrian crossings,

central
median,
etc.
The necessary road markings are also indicated thereon.

CO-ORDINATION OF TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNALS
14.1.
Traffic control signals within
1 km of one another along
major route or in a net work of intersecting major routes should be
operated
in
co-ordination,
preferably
with
inter-connected
con-
trollers.
However,
co-ordination need not be maintained
across
boundaries
between
signal
systems
which
operates
on different
time cycles.
14.2.
Appendix
1,
indicates methodology for interconnection
of adjacent signals along a particular route.
15.
FLASHING OPERATION OF TRAFFIC
CONTROL SIGNALS
15.1.
All
traffic
signal
installations
shall be provided with
an electrical flashing mechanism supplementary to the signal timer.
A manual switch or where appropriate,
automatic means, shall be
provided to actuate the flashing mechanism.
The signal
timer shall
be removable without affecting flashing operation.
The mechanism
shall
operate
in a manner similar to a flashing beacon, to provide
intermittent illumination of selected signal lenses.
15.2.
The
illuminating
element in a flashing signal shall be
flashed continuously at a rate of 50-60 flashes per minute when the
applied voltage varies in the range between 20 per cent and
15 per
cent of its nominal value and ± 4 per cent of its nominal frequency
and
over
a
temperature
range 0 degree C to 55 degree C as per
IS: 7537-1974.
15.3.
Automatic changes from flashing to stop and go opera-
tion
shall
be made at the beginning of major street green interval.
Automatic changes from stop and go operation to flashing shall
be
made at the end of major street red interval. For manual switches,
the changes may be made at any time.
16.
CONTINUITY OF OPERATION
16.1.
A traffic signal installation shall be operated as
a
stop
and go device or a flashing device.
16.2.
When
a
signal installation
is not in operation, such as
prior to placing it in service, during seasonal
shut downs, or when
it
is
not
desirable
to operate the signals, they should be hooded,
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: 93-1985
turned or taken down to clearly indicate that
the
signal
is
not in
operation.
16.3.
When
a
traffic signal installation is being operated as
a
flashing
device, the amber indication shall be flashed
in at
least
two required signal faces
on
each
approach
on
which
traffic
is
not
stopped
and the red indication shall be flashed in at least two
required signal faces on each approach on which traffic is
required
to stop and proceed.
16.4.
When
a
traffic
signal
is
being operated in the usual
stop
and
go
mannnr,
at
least
one indication in each signal face
shall be illuminated.
17.
SIGNAL OPERATION RELATING TO TRAFFIC FLOW
17.1.
Traffic
control
signals
shall be operated in a manner
consistent with traffic requirements.
Data
from traffic
and
engi-
neering
studies shall be u; ed to determine the proper phasing and
timing for a signal.
17.2.
Since traffic flows and patterns change,
it
is necessary
that the traffic data be updated and re-evaluated regularly.
17.3.
To ensure that the approved operating pattern includ-
ing timing
is displayed to the driver, regular checks
including
the
use of accurate timing devices should be made.
18.
MAINTENANCE OF TRAFFIC SIGNALS
18.1.
Prior
to
the
installation
of any traffic control signal,
the responsibility for its maintenance should be clearly established.
The responsible agency should provide for the maintenance of the
signal and
all of its appurtenances
in
a
responsible
manner.
To
this end, the agency should:
(i) Provide
for
alternate operation of signal during a period of failure
either on flash or manually, or by
having manual
traffic
direction
by
proper
authority
as
may
be warranted
by traffic volumes or
congestion.
(ii) Have
properly
skilled
maintenance
staff available without undue
delay for all emergency calls, including lamp failures.
(iii) Provide properly skilled maintenance for all components.
(iv) Maintain the appearance of the installation in
a manner
consistant
with
the
intention of
this
standard,
with particular emphasis on
painting and on cleaning of the optical system.
(v) Provide
adequate
stand-by
equipment
to minimise interruption of
signal operation, due to equipment failure.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: 93-1985
(vi) Service
equipment
and
lamps,
as
frequently as experience proves
necessary, to prevent undue failures.
18.2.
Every controller should be kept in
effective
operation
in
strict
accordance
with
its predetermined timing schedule.
In
this regard, the manufacturer shall be insisted upon to ensure
that
the
design
of any control equipment shall be such that when the
right-of-way signal
is shown to one phase,
it shall
not
be
possible
through
failure
of any
operating
component of the controller to
give a right-of-way signal to a conflicting
traffic
phase.
A
device
shall
be
provided
in
the
equipment housing which continuously
monitors the controller signal and if
the
controller
fails
to
cycle
for
any
reason
other than power failure,
it shall cause automatic
change over to flashing of amber light or turn
off*
all
signal
lights
as per IS: 7537-1974.
19.
PAINTING
19.1.
The
insides
of
visors
(hoods)
and the entire surface
of louvers and fins and the front surface of back
plates
shall
have
dull
black
finish
to
minimise
light
reflection
to
the side of the
signals.
19.2.
To
obtain
the
best
possible
contrast with the visual
back
ground,
it
is
desirable
to paint
the signal post, and signal
housing with traffic yellows.
20.
AUXILIARY
SIGNS
Auxiliary signs used with traffic signals such as restrictions
of
turning movements, etc. shall be located adjacent to the signal face
to which they apply.
When used in conjuction' with traffic
signals,
illuminated
signs,
shall
be
designed
and
mounted
in
such
a
manner so as to avoid glare and
reflections
that
seriously
detract
from
the
signal
indications.
The
traffic
control
signal shall be
given dominent position and brightness to assure
its target
priority
in the overall display.
21.
REMOVAL OF CONFUSING ADVERTISING LIGHTS
There should be legal authority to prohibit the display of any
unauthorised sign, advertisement, signal, marking or device
which
interferes with the effectiveness of any official
traffic control device.
22.
DETERMINATION OF CYCLE LENGTHS AND
GREEN PERIOD IN SIGNAL PHASING
22.1.
Pedestrian Green
The
width
of carriageway
to
be crossed in metre may
be
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: 93-1985
divided by the assumed walking speed
of
1.2
metre
per
second
to
determine
the
green
interval
required
for pedestrian to cross
the carriageway.
A value of seven seconds must be added to
this
value being the reaction time of the pedestrian and the
total
value
will
then
be
the green time that should be allotted for the pedes-
trian phase.
22.2.
The optimum cycle
length
should
be
designed
such
that delay at all approaches will be minimised.
It should be such
that adequate pedestrian clearance time
is
available
for
crossing
all approaches. Adequate increased timing for commercial as
well
as turning vehicles should
also
be
provided.
The
cycle
lengths
should be multiples of five. If it works out to odd number, it should
be
rounded
oft
to
the
immediate
higher
multiple of five.
The
maximum cycle length
recommended
is
preferably
120
seconds
being the maximum acceptable delay for
drivers
of
vehicles
and
pedestrians.
22.3.
The
apportionment
of green
time
for
vehicles
on
an
individual
approach
should
be
done
in
proportion
to
the
number of vehicles per lane of that approach. At the
intersections,
the
approach
lanes
shall
be
considered
to
be
2.8
metre
in
width.
22.4.
There shall preferably be not more
than a maximum
of 4 phases in any given cycle.
22.5.
There shall be 3 cycle lengths worked out
for
a
day,
namely, for (1) morning peak period, (2) afternon off peak
period,
(3) evening peak period.
22.6.
The following assumptions are made while
calculating
the green time for vehicles:
(a) The vehicles arriving at an intersection on
an approach,
distribute
themselves
equally
on
the
different
approach
lanes meant
for
a particular direction.
(b) The number
of
vehicles
arriving on
an
approach
is equal in all-
cycles, having identical cycle lengths.
(c) The reaction time to start from
stop
position
for
the
first
vehicle
is
6
seconds
and
subsequent
vehicles

ADVANCE TRAFFIC AND ENGINEERING
DATA REQUIRED
1.1.
A
comprehensive
investigation
of
traffic
conditions
and physical characteristics of the
location
is
required
to
deter-
mine the necessity for a signal installation and to furnish
necessary
data for the proper design and operation of a signal that is warran-
ted.
Such data desirable should include
:
(i) The number of motorised vehicles entering
the
intersection
in
each
hour from each approach during
10
consecutive
hours
of a
repre-
sentative day. The
16 hours selected should contain the greatest per-
centage of 24 hours traffic.
(ii) Vehicular volumes for each
traffic movement
from
each approach
for at
least
2
hours morning and
2
hours
evening
peak periods
classified by vehicle type (trucks, buses, passenger cars,
taxis,
jeeps,
tempos, motor cycles and
scooters).
Non-motorised
vehicles
such
as (hand carts, bullock carts, victorias, rickshaws, pedel cycles,
etc.).
For
convenience,
the
classification may
be
heavy
vehicles,
light
vehicles, motor cycles and scooters and non-motorised vehicles.
(iii)
Pedestrian
volume
counts on
each
cross
walk
during
the
same
periods as vehicular counts in para
(ii) above and also
during
hours
of highest pedestrian volumes.
(iv) The 85th percentile speed of all vehicles on the
uncontrolled
appro-
aches to the location.
If not, at least an average speed
of approach
must be recorded.
(v) A condition diagram showing details of the physical layout including
such
features
as
intersectional
geometries,
channelisation, grades,
sight distance restrictions, bus
stops and
routings,
parking
condi-
tions, pavement
markings,
street
lighting,
drive
ways, location of
nearby rail-road crossings distance
to
nearest
signals,
utility
poles
and fixtures, and adjacent land use, etc.
(vi) A
collision
diagram
showing accident experienced by type, location
direction
of movement,
severity,
time
of day,
date and
day
of
week for at least one year.
1.2.
The
following
data
are
also
desirable
for
a
more
precise
understanding
of
the
operation
of
the
intersection and
may
be
obtained
during
periods
specified
in
para
1.1.
(ii)
in
this chapter:
(i) Delay
in
seconds
per
vehicle
determined
separately
for
each
approach.
(ii) The 85th percentile speed of vehicles on
the
controlled approaches
at a point near to the intersection but unaffected by the control.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 48

IRC: 93-1985
(iii) Pedestrian
delay
time
for
at
least
two
30 minute peak pedestrian
delay periods of an average week-day or like periods of a Sunday
or
Saturday.
1.3.
Adequate
roadway capacity at a signalised intersection
is desirable. Widening of both the main highway
and
intersecting
roadway may be warranted to reduce the delays caused by
assign-
ment of right-of-way
at intersections
controlled
by
traffic signals.
Widening
of
intersecting
roadway
is often beneficial to operation
on the main highway because
it reduces the
signal time
that
must
be
assigned
to
side-street
traffic.
In
urban
areas,
the effect of
widening
can
be
achieved
by
elimination of parking at intersec-
tional
approaches.
It
is
always
desirable
to
have
at
least two
lanes
for
moving
traffic
on
each approach to a signalised
inter-
section.
Additional
width may
be necessary on the leaving
side
of
the
intersection
as
well
as
on the approach side,
in order to
clear traffic through the intersection
effectively.
Before
an
inter-
section is widened, the additional green
time
needed
by
pedest-
rians
to
cross
the
widened
streets
should be checked to ensure
that
it
will
not
exceed
the
green
time saved through improved
vehicular flow.
2. WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL
INSTALLATION
2.1.
Traffic
control
signals
should
not be installed, unless
one
or
more of the
signal warrants specified herein are met.
In-
formation
should
be obtained by means of traffic and engineering
studies
and
compared
with
the
requirements
set
forth
in
the
warrants.
If these requirements are not met, a traffic signal should
neither be put into operation not continued in operation (if already
installed).
2.2. When a traffic control signal is indicated as being warra-
nted,
it is presumed that the
signal and
all related
traffic control
devices, and markings are
installed according
to the standards set
forth in the previous sections.
It is further
presumed
that
signal
indications
are
properly
phased,
roadways
properly
designed,
and that there
is adequate supervision of operation and maintenance
of the
signal.
All of its related device and traffic signal
controller
shall
be selected
on the basis of engineering study and judgement.
All
the
mechanical
and
electrical
equipment
shall
conform
to
I.S.I, standards.
2.3.
An investigation of
the need for
traffic
signal
control
should
include
where
applicable,
at
least
an analysis of factors
contained in the following warrants
:

for
application
where
the
volume
of
intersecting
traffic
is
the
principal
reason

4. WARRANT 2 — INTERRUPTION OF
CONTINUOUS TRAFFIC
4.1.
The
interruption
of
continuous traffic warrant applied
to operating conditions where the traffic volume on a
major
street
is
so
heavy that traffic on a minor intersecting street suffers exces-
sive delay or hazard in entering or crossing the major
street.
The
warrant is satisfied when,
for
each
of any
8 hours of an average
day,
the
traffic
volume
given in Table 3 exist on the major street
and on the higher volume minor
street
approaching
the
intersec-

During
the 8 hours, the direction of
higher
volume
on
the minor street may be on one approach during some
hours and
on the
opposite
approach
during
other
hours.
When
the
85th
percentile
speed
(or
average
approach
speed)
of major
street
traffic exceeds 60 kmph
or when
the
intersection
lies
within
the
built-up area of an isolated community, having a population of less
than 2.5 lakhs,
the
interruption of continuous
traffic
warrant
is
70 per cent of the requirements above (in recognition of
difference
in the nature and
operational
characteristics
of
traffic
in
urban
and rural environments and smaller municipalities).
5. WARRANT 3—MINIMUM PEDESTRAIN VOLUME
5.1.
The minimum
pedestrain
volume
warrant
is
satisfied
when for each of any 8 hours
of an
average
day,
the
following
traffic volumes exist
:

intersection
(total of both approaches)
or
where
there
is a raised median island 1.5

there are
150
or more
pedestrains per hour on the highest volume cross-walk crossing the major
street.
5.2.
When the 85th
percentile
speed
(or
average
approach
speed) of major traffic exceeds 60 kmph,
or when the
intersection
lies
within
the
built-up area of an isolated
community
having
a
population
of
less
than
2.5
lakhs
the
minimum
pedestrian
volume warrant
is 70 per cent of the
requirements
above
(in
re-
cognition of the
difference in the nature and
operational
charac-
teristics of traffic in
urban and
rural
environments
and
smaller
municipalities).
5.3.
A signal installed under this warrant at an isolated
inter-
section or mid-block, should
be
of the traffic
actuated type
with
push buttons for pedestrains crossing the
main
street.
If
experi-
ence proves that
it is being tampered
with
or
misuse
anticipated,
they can be of the usual fixed
time
cycle and
phases.
If such
a
signal
is installed at
an
intersection,
it
should
be
equipped
and
operated with control devices which provide proper
co-ordination
with other signals in the system.
5.4.
Signal
installed
according
to
this
warrant
shall
be
equipped with pedestrian indications conforming
to
requirements
set forth in previous sections.
Signals
may
be
installed
at
non-
intersection
locations
(mid-block)
provided
the
requirements of
this warrant are met, and provided that the
related
cross-walk
is
not closer
than
300
metre
to
another
established
cross-walk.
Kerb side
parking
should
be
prohibited
for
75 metre
before
and
75 metre
beyond
the
cross-walk.
Phasing,
co-ordination
and installation
must
conform
to
standards.
Special
attention
should be given to the signal head placement
and
the
signs
and
markings used at non-intersection locations, to be
sure that drivers
are aware of this special application.
6.
WARRANT 4—ACCIDENT EXPERIENCE
The accident experience warrant is
satisfied when
:
(i) Adequate trial of less restrictive
remedies
with
satisfactory
observance
and enforcement have failed to reduce the accident frequency, and
(ii)
Five or more reported
accidents,
of
types
susceptible of
correction by
traffic signal control have occurred within a period
of
12
months,
each
accident involving personal injury or
property damage
to
an
apparent
extent of Rs 2000 or more.
(iii) The signal installation will not seriously disrupt
traffic flow.

Appendix 1
NEED FOR CO-ORDINATED CONTROL
Need for
co-ordinated
control
of
signals
arises on a main traffic route
when
it
is desirable to reduce delays and
avoid
main traffic
from having to stop
at every junction.
Wh^n a signal
indicates a
stop aspect at a junction, a queue
of vehicles
is formed behind the stop line.
When
the
signal
changes to green,
the vehicles start moving
in a platoon
If this platoon is
made to meet a green
aspect at the next
junction, no delay
is caused
to the
vehicles.
This principle
of linking adjacent signals
o as to secure maximum benefits
to the flow of traffic
is called co-ordinated cont
ol of signals.
The co-ordination
of signalr.
is sought for with
the following
objectives in
view
:
(i) To pass maximum amourt of traffic without enforced halts.
(ii) To have minimum overall delay to traffic streams, both in the main and
side roads.
(iii) To prevent the queue of vehicles at one intersection from extending and
reaching to the next intersection.
In general, the
co-ordination
of signals is aimed
at
giving
a progressive
movement to traffic in a specified direction at a
predetermined
speed.
In prac-
tice,
it
is usually found that about 60 per cent of the vehicles are able to clear the
intersections in the corridor.
It
is therefore
necessary
that
the signals are not
separated by large distances so as to ensure
the driver's
visibility to maintain a
constant rate of motion.
Where the visibility
is impaired
due to large distances,
it
is advisable to introduce an
additional
signal so
as
to enable
continuity of
perception of green by the driver along the entire route of co-ordination.
OFF-SET
The off-set
is defined as the difference
between the
starts of green
time at
the successive upstream and downstream signals.
This
is an important
conside
ration in planning a system of co-ordination.
If the start of
green at the down-
stream signal
is off-set at a
particular value such
that the platoon, which starts
at the upstream
signal
upon
a green
indication
there,
arrives at
the down-
stream signal just in
time
for the
green
signal,
the platoon has an unhindered
movement, Fig. 6.
TIME AND DISTANCE DIAGRAM
In planning a system of co-ordinated signal control,
it
is often expedient to
indicate the system diagrammatically by what
is known as a "time-and-distance"
or "time-and-space" diagram.
On this diagram, the time and signal settings are
indicated along the
horizontal
axis to
a suitable
scale,
whereas
the distance
travelled along the major route is plotted vertically to a suitable scale.
A typical
time and distance diagram for a one-way street
is shown in,
Fig. 7 and one for a
two-way-street is shown in, Fig. 8.
TYPES OF CO-ORDINATED SIGNAL SYSTEMS
The four basic types of co-ordinated signal systems are:

Simultaneous system, also known as synchoronised system

SIMULTANEOUS SYSTEM
Under this
system,
all the
signals
along a
given
street
always
disnlav
the same indication to the same traffic stream at the same
time.
The division of
the cycle time is
the
same
at all intersections.
A master
controller
is emnlo
yed to keep the series of
signals
instep.
The
disadvantages of a simultaneous
systems are
*
(i)
It
is not conducive to give continuous movement of all vehicles,
33



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 48
======================================================================
IRC
: ^3-1985
(li)
It encourages speeding of drivers between stops.
(iii)
The overall speed
is often reduced.
(iv)
Because the division of the cycle time
is the same at all the intersections,
inefficiency is inevitable at some intersections.
(v) The simultaneous stoppage of a continuous line of
ti aflic at all intersec-
tions often results in difficulty for the side street
vehicles in turning into
or crossing the main side street.
ALTERNATE SYSTEM (LIMITED PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM)
Under this system, consecutive signal installations
along a giveD road show
contrary indications at the same
time.
This
permits the
vehicles to travel one
block in half the cycle
time.
This
system operates
efficiently where the blocks
are of equal lengths.
It also brings
about
a certain
measure
of speed control
since speeding drivers are stopped at each signal.
Some of the disadvantages of this system are:
(i) The green times for both the main and side
streets have to be substan-
tially equal, resulting in inefficiency at most of the intersections.
(ii)
In situations where the block lengths are unequal, the system
is not well
suited.
(iii)
Adjustments are difficult for changing traffic conditions.
SIMPLE PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM
With this system, the various signals along a street
display green aspects in
accordance with a time
schedule
to permit,
as
neaily as
possible, continuous
operation of
platoons of
vehicles along the
street at a planned rate of motion,
which may vary indifferent parts of the system.
The offset at each installation
is
determined so as
to secure the best conti-
nuous movement of plaioons
in
both
directions.
These
offsets are fixed and
cannot be altered at
different periods of the day.
Each
signal
installation may
have a cycle division different (torn the
others,
but that
division lemains fixed
throughout the day.
FLEXIBLE PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM
This system
is an improvement over the
simple progressive system with the
following provisions:
(i)
It
is possible to vary
the cycle
time and division at each signal depen-
ding upon traffic.
(ii)
It
is possible
to
vary the offset, thus enabling two or more completely
different plans.
(iii)
It
is
possible
to
introduce
flashing
or
shut down during off-peak
houis.
Flexible
progressive
systems
require a master
controller which keeps the
local controllers at each intersection in step.

Appendix 3
CHECK FOR DESIGN OF SIGNAL CYCLE TIMINGS ON THE
BASIS OF VEHICULAR VOLUME
It
is assumed
that
the
first
vehicle
on
each
approach lane will take six
seconds reaction time to start after stop and subsequent vehicular in the platoon
will follow at a constant headway of 2 seconds each.
It
is to be ensured that
the minimum
time
for
any vehicular phase
is not
kept
less than 16 seconds so as to provide for built in safety.
Check for major approach
In
the
above
example,
the
vehicle
volume on the major street
lv\ o lane
is equal to 660 vehicles per hour.
Number of vehicles per hour per
lane = 330
Number of vehicles per lane per cycle"!
330 60 = 5.5
of 60 seconds
J
say 6
Therefore
green
time
required,
on
the
basis
of above
assumptions
for
mijor street approach =
1
x
6 +
5 x
2 = 6+
10 =
16 seconds
Since 34 seconds green time is provided on the basis of pedestrian clearance
period,
it
is safe.
Check for minor street approach
Number of vehicles per hour per lane =
180 V.P.H.
Number of vehicles per lane per cycle = 180 60 =
3
Therefore
green
time
required
on
the
basis
of the above assumption for
minor street approach =1
6 + 2 x 2 = 10 seconds
Since
18
seconds
green time
is already provided on the basis of pedestrian
clearance period,
it
is safe.
Optimisation of signal timings
Webster's formula, Co — ~ * ,^vv—
X-YI-Y2
...Yn
Where
Co = Optimum cycle length in seconds
L
= Total lost time per cycl^
Y
= Volume/Saturation flow for critical approach in each phase.
In
the above
example,
total
lest
time
per
cycle
is equal to total amber
time per cycle i.e. 8 seconds plus 4 seconds reaction time for first vehicle in phase
1
plus
4
seconds
reaction
time for first vehicle in phase 2
i.e. equal to total
16
seconds.
Saturation flow = 525 W p.c.u.s
per hour where W
is the width of the
approach
in
metre
measured
from
kerb to the inside of the central median or
mentioned centre line of the approach. Though above mentioned formula
is valid
37

IRC

for widths from 5.5 to
18
metre
for lesser widths
the
values may
be obtained
from the table given below
:
Width W in metres
3.0
3.5
4.0
4.5
5.0

Saturation flow
(p.c.u's) per hour
1850
1890
1950
2250
2550
2990
Saturation flow for critical approach in phase
1 = 525 x
6
-3150 pcu/hour
Saturation flow for critical approach in phase 2 = 1850 (from table)
yi = 660/3150 = 0.21
y 2 = 180/1850 = 0.10
Optimum cycle length Co =
21— 0^10^ =
0^9
=
42,02 seconds
Say
45 seconds, as Lhe cycle time
is expressed
in multiples of 5.
The
cycle
length may be distributed as green time to the two phases on the
0 21
basis of g x\g% = ytfrt =
Therefore £ X = 30.48 seconds
g2 — 14.52 seconds
Effective
green
after
deducting
initial
and final amber time works out
as
follows
:
gi — 30.48—2-2 = 26.48 seconds
g* « 14.52—2-2 =
10.52 seconds
But
as
per
pedestrian
requirements
effective green
for
minor
street
to
accommodate crossing major street equals 17 seconds.
Therefore total g% including amber is equal to 17 + 2 + 2 = 21 seconds
The
green
for
the
major
street
is
already
kept
as
34
seconds which
is
greater
than
effective green
of 26.48
seconds.
As
such
the
signal
timings
initially worked out are safe.
