STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND CODE OF 
PRACTICE FOR ROAD BRIDGES
SECTION: IX
BEARINGS
PART-III: POT, PIN, METALLIC GUIDE AND 
PLANE SLIDING BEARINGS
INTRODUCTION
The Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section IX–POT, 
POT-CUM-PTFE, PIN and Metallic Guide Bearings, Part-III based on working stress method 
was first published in March, 2002. Thereafter, unprecedented growth of knowledge in the 
field of Bridge Bearing Design, Manufacturing & Installation, Acceptance Specifications, 
Certification & Marketing and Development of high performance materials took place in the 
past 15 years. Hence, a need was felt by B-6 committee (2012-2014) to revise this document 
based on Ultimate Limit State (ULS) condition and to include Plain sliding bearing. The 
reconstituted B-6 Committee in 2015 assigned the task of preparing the initial revised draft to 
Shri S. Majumdar and Dr. M.V.B Rao. The revised draft “Standard Specifications and Code of 
Practice for Road Bridges, Section IX - Part III - POT, PIN, Metallic Guide and Plane Sliding 
Bearings” was circulated among the members of B-6 Committee for inviting comments from 
its Members. Members submitted their comments on the circulated draft document to B-6 
Committee. The B-6 Committee constituted a Sub-Committee comprising of the following 
members to incorporate the comments in the revised draft document appropriately:
(i)	 Shri A.K. Banerjee, Convener;
(ii)	 Shri H.C. Arora;
(iii)	Shri Alok Bhowmick;
(iv)	Col. Ashok Bhasin;
(v)	 Dr. S.S. Gaharwar.
The Sub-committee finalized the revised draft document and submitted it to B-6 Committee. 
The B-6 Committee discussed and approved the document in its meeting held on 
15th September, 2017 for placing it in the Bridges Specifications and Standards (BSS) 
Committee. The BSS Committee approved the document in its meeting held on 23rd October, 
2017. Subsequently, the Executive Committee approved the document on 2nd November, 
2017 for placing it before the IRC Council. Finally, the document was considered by the 
IRC Council in its meeting held on 3rd November, 2017 during the Annual Session held at 
Bengaluru (Karnataka) and was approved for publication.

1 SCOPE
This section of the specification (referred to as ‘code’ hereinafter) deals with requirements for 
the materials, design, manufacture, testing, installation and maintenance of Pot, Pin, Metallic 
Guide and Plane Sliding bearings for road bridges. The provisions of this code are meant 
to serve as a guide to both design and construction engineers, but mere compliance with 
the provisions stipulated herein will not relieve them in any way of their responsibility for the 
stability and soundness of the structure designed and erected.
This part of code specifies the requirements for the design and manufacture of pot bearings 
which will be used for operating temperatures between – 20 °C and 50 °C.
Pot bearings with confined elastomeric pressure pads up to 1500 mm diameter are within the 
scope of this code.
High performance elastomeric pressure pad in combination with specific internal seal and 
sliding material (e.g. UHMWPE) can be used subjected to availability of approval document 
from international approving bodies like ETA, FHWA or similar acceptance by other leading 
international Specifications.
Bearings which are subjected to tensile loads are beyond the scope of this code.
Bearings which are subjected to rotations greater than 0.03 radians are beyond the scope of 
this code.
Sliding surfaces with a diameter of the circumscribing circle of single or multiple PTFE sheets 
or other approved sliding materials e.g. UHMWPE approved through ETA, FHWA or similar 
acceptance by other leading international Specifications, less than 75 mm or greater than 
1500 mm, are outside the scope of this code. Sliding elements for use as temporary devices 
during construction, for example during launching of the superstructure, are also outside the 
scope of this code.
For demanding application in situations beyond the limitations stated above, specialist 
literatures and international codes shall be followed. In such situations, only specialist 
manufacturers, having proven experience of designing and supplying similar bearings in 
similar situations, shall be engaged.
2 TERMINOLOGY
2.1	
Pot Bearing

For a uniform distribution of load on an area Ac0 (Fig. 5.3) the concentrated resistance force 
may be determined as follows:

cylinder wall and as such shall be verified by load testing of assembled bearing.
5.2.3.2	
The design maximum axial force Nsd in ULS condition shall meet the following 
condition under the critical combination of actions:

limited by the effectiveness of the seal preventing the elastomer from extruding between the 
piston and the pot wall.

Particular recommendations for design of Pot bearings
Stress distribution through the bearing component adjacent to the (supported/supporting) 
structure as well as on the structure itself due to active load, force and induced force and 
moment produced due to resistance to movement and rotation in ULS condition shall be 
determined with due considerations to the relative stiffness and interaction of the bearing 
component and the adjacent structure by a suitable method e.g. three dimensional finite 
element (3D-FEM) method of analysis. In absence of elaborate 3D-FEM analysis, design 
procedure specified in Clause 5.3.1.2 may be adopted to determine the dimensions of 
bearing components. However for Pot bearings of vertical load capacity 10,000 kN or higher 
in SLS condition or if horizontal load is more than 25% of vertical load in SLS condition, 
the pot cylinder shall always be analysed by three-dimensional finite element method of 
analysis. Only internationally accepted, authentic software shall be used for carrying out 
3D-FEM analysis.
5.3.1.1	
To carry out 3D-FEM analysis, bearing component and the adjacent structure 
shall be modelled together. For concrete structure, a block of concrete shall be considered 
for modelling together with the adjacent bearing component. The area of the block shall be 
geometrically similar to the contact area and also the largest area that can be contained in 
the plane of contact of bearing and structure. The depth of the concrete block shall be equal 
to the minimum available depth of the adjacent component of the concrete structure over 
the area of the block. The depth of concrete block need not exceed the largest dimension 
(diameter or diagonal) of the bearing component along the contact plane.

7.4.3.3.2	 Friction test: For bearings with sliding component, friction test shall be performed 
to determine static coefficient of friction of properly lubricated sliding interface at constant 
vertical load equal to the design vertical load in SLS condition. Test assembly may comprise 
of a pair of bearing or a bearing and dummy sliding interface made of similar material. The 
horizontal load shall be applied till sliding occurs. Coefficient of friction (μ) shall be determined 
as the ratio of Horizontal Load at which sliding occurs divided by 2 times the applied Vertical 
Load (two times the vertical load in denominator represents two sliding interface due to use

======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 79
======================================================================
50
IRC:83 (Part-III)-2018
7.4.4	
In case of any evidence of process of acceptance control testing being deemed 
unsatisfactory by the inspector, complete bearing or particular component(s) of the entire lot 
may be rejected depending on the cause of rejection i.e. if the raw material testing result of 
any material is unsatisfactory the component(s) involving that material shall be rejected for 
the entire lot but if a finished bearing fails in load test the complete bearing shall be rejected 
and all the bearings of that type and load capacity shall be load tested before acceptance. 
If the result of process inspection is unsatisfactory, proper rectification measures should be 
adopted and the acceptance test(s) shall be repeated.
8 CERTIFICATION & MARKING
8.1 
Certification and marking should be done as follows:
8.1.1	
Bearings should be transported to bridge site after final acceptance by the inspector/ 
inspection agency appointed by the concerned authority and shall be accompanied by an 
authenticated copy of the certificate to that effect.
8.1.2	
It is desirable to list the required bearing characteristics in a consistent and 
comprehensive manner in an information card duly certified by the manufacturer and append 
the same with the inspection certificate.
8.1.3	
All bearings shall have suitable index markings made of indelible ink or flexible 
paint, which if practicable shall be visible after installation, identifying the following information:
	
 Name of manufacturer
	
 Month and year of manufacture
	
 Bearing designation
	
 Type of bearing
	
 Load and movement capacity
	
 Centreline markings to facilitate installation
	
 Direction of major and minor movement, if any
	
 Pre-set, if any
9 INSTALLATION
9.1	
General
9.1.1	
Bearings should be installed with care to ensure their correct functioning in 
accordance with the design for the whole structure. Bearings shall be so located as to avoid 
accumulation of dirt and debris likely to interfere with their performance and the structure so 
detailed that water is prevented from reaching the bearings. Proper installation of bearing is of 
utmost importance to ensure proper functioning of bearing and its durability. Poor installation 
may not only damage a high quality bearing but also may cause damage, instability and 
collapse of structures.



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 79
======================================================================
51

IRC:83 (Part-III)-2018
9.1.2	
In order that moving surfaces are not contaminated, bearings should not normally 
be dismantled after leaving the manufacture’s workshop but if for any reason they are, then 
this should only be done under expert supervision and the manufacturer’s assistance should 
be sought.
9.1.3	
Transfer of superstructure weight on to bearings should not be allowed until 
sufficient strength has developed in the bedding material to resist the applied load. Temporary 
clamping devices should be removed at an appropriate time before the bearings are required 
to accommodate movement. Consideration should be given to any treatment required to 
holes exposed on the removal of temporary transit clamps. Where reuse of these fixing holes 
may be required, the material selected to fill them should not only give protection against 
deterioration but also should be easily removable without damaging the threads.
9.1.4	
Suitable temporary supporting arrangements under bearing base plates should 
be made to accommodate thermal movement and elastic deformation of the incomplete 
superstructure, if necessary. Such temporary supports, if provided, should be compressible 
under design loading or removed once the bedding material has reached the required 
strength. Any voids left as a consequence of their removal should be made good using the 
same type of bedding material. Steel folding wedges and rubber pads are suitable for such 
temporary supports under bearing base plates.
9.1.5	
A bearing will only work properly if the connected parts of the structure are rigid 
enough. This is usually achievable for massive concrete structure with properly done bedding 
(Clause 9.2). But in case of steel superstructure an increased level of stiffness with adequate 
stiffeners to avoid local bending / buckling of bottom girder seating above the bearing is 
absolutely necessary.
9.1.6	
Correct location and orientation of the bearing with respect to the structures is 
of immense importance Mixing up in location or orientation may cause severe structural 
instability during construction and service.
9.1.7	
Stability of structure or structural component (girder) over bearing shall be ensured 
at every stage of construction. Adequate external support/arrangement may be necessary 
to ensure stability of superstructures or its part at every stage of construction and till overall 
stability of the structure is achieved.
9.2	
Bedding
9.2.1	
Bearing shall not be placed directly on matured concrete surface without use of 
appropriate bedding material.
9.2.2	
The choice of bedding materials is influenced by the method of installation of the 
bearings, the size of the gap to be filled, the strength required and the required setting time. 
When selecting the bedding material, consideration should therefore be given to various 
factors like type of bearing, size of bearing, loading on bearing, construction sequence and 
timing, early loading, friction requirements, access around the bearing, thickness of material 



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 79
======================================================================
52
IRC:83 (Part-III)-2018
required, design and condition of surface in the bearing area, shrinkage of the bedding 
material etc. as appropriate.
9.2.3	
The thickness of the bedding material should be made as less as possible 
maintaining the requirement of workability and strength.
9.2.4	
It is essential that the composition and workability of the bedding material be 
specified with the above factors in mind. In some cases it may be necessary to carry out 
trials to ascertain the most suitable material. Commonly used materials are non-shrink, free 
flow, cementitious or chemical resin mortar and grout.
9.2.5	
To ensure even loading on bearings and the supporting structures, it is essential 
that any bedding material whether above and below the bearing, extend over the whole area 
of the bearing. Improper application of bedding material, below and above the bearing, i.e. 
voids, gaps, impurity etc. may attribute to failure of the bearing irrespective of the quality of 
the product.
9.2.6	
Bearings shall be bedded over their whole area. After installation there shall be no 
voids or hard spots. The bedding material shall be capable of transmitting the applied load to 
the structure without damage. Surfaces to receive bedding mortar shall be suitably prepared 
to a state compatible with the mortar chosen. The top surface of any extension of the bedding 
beyond the bearing shall have a downward slope away from the bearing.
9.3	
Fixing of Bearing
9.3.1	
To cater for vibration and accidental impact, some anchorage should be provided. 
Anchorage should be accurately set into recesses cast into the structure using templates and 
the remaining voids in the recesses should be filled with material capable of withstanding the 
loads involved.
9.3.2	
Bearings that are to be installed on temporary supports should be firmly fixed to 
the substructure by anchorage or other means to prevent disturbance during subsequent 
operations. Finally voids beneath the bearings should be completely filled with bedding 
material using the appropriate method.
9.3.3	
Bearings may be fixed directly to metal bedding plates that may be cast in or 
bedded on top of the supporting structure or bottom of superstructure to the correct level 
and location. It is not advisable to fix foundation anchorages to both substructure and the 
superstructure simultaneously. This is for the reason of construction tolerances on the span 
length. Generally recess are provided in the substructure for the anchorages.
9.3.4	
If the structure is of steel, the bearings may be bolted or welded directly to it. Proper 
care shall be taken to ensure that there are no mismatch in the bolt holes of the structure and 
the bearing. In case of welding care should between to assess and avoid damage of bearing 
or its components due to heat or distortion.


IRC:83 (Part-III)-2018
9.3.5	
Threaded fasteners shall be tightened uniformly to avoid overstressing of any part 
of the bearing.
9.3.6	
Where bearings are installed prior to forming an in-situ concrete deck, formwork 
around bearings should be carefully sealed to prevent grout / slurry leakage. However, 
it is essential that the bearings and particularly the working surfaces be protected during 
concreting operations. Sliding plates should be fully supported and care taken to prevent 
tilting, displacement or distortion of the bearings under weight of wet concrete. Any mortar 
contaminating the bearings should be completely removed before it sets.
9.3.7	
For bearings supporting precast concrete elements a thin layer of synthetic resin 
mortar should be used between bearings and precast concrete beams. Bearings shall be 
bolted to anchor plates or metal bedding plates embedded in precast elements.
9.3.8	
For bearing supporting steel elements a machined sole plate shall be used to 
ensure proper contact.
9.4	
Installation Tolerance
9.4.1	
The tolerances given in Clause 9.4.2 shall be observed unless otherwise specified.
9.4.2	
Bearings shall be located so that their centrelines are within +/- 3 mm of their 
correct position. The level of a bearing or the mean levels of more than one bearing at any

10 MAINTENANCE
10.1	
This section stipulates the requirements for inspection and maintenance of Pot, 
Sliding, Pin and Metallic Guide bearings during service period.
10.1.1	
Bearings should be designed and manufactured to make it maintenance free 
so that it can eliminate undesirable effects caused by extreme atmosphere or aggressive 
environmental condition / unforeseen events. However, the surrounding area of the bearings 
shall always be kept clean and dry to avoid damage to the bearings.
10.1.2	
Suitable easy access to the bearing shall be provided for inspection and 
maintenance. It is advisable to provide adequate maneuvering space all around the bearing. 
Provision shall be made for jacking up the superstructure so as to allow repair/ replacement 
of the bearings.
10.1.3	
Inspection of bearing at site is required from time to time to ascertain the 
performance of the bearings. Periodic nominal maintenance of bearing shall be carried out in 
order to ensure better performance and longer life of the bearings. The bearings are required 
to be inspected at an interval of one year for the first five years and at an interval of two years

thereafter. However the bearings shall also be examined carefully after unusual occurrences 
like heavy traffic, earthquakes, cyclones and battering from debris in high floods.
10.1.4	
The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning of the bearings as well as its 
surrounding space, depending on the actual conditions around the bearings e.g. deposit of 
salt, debris, dust or other foreign material.
10.2	
Elements of inspection
10.2.1	
Measurement of movement
During inspection at site, measurements are required to be taken and documented to 
compute its movement and rotation values in relation to their design values to ascertain 
whether the performance of the bearings are satisfactory. To ascertain maximum movement, 
measurement should be taken once during peak winter (early morning) and once during 
peak summer (afternoon) and corresponding atmospheric temperature should be recorded. 
The recorded value of movement shall be compared with the design values.
10.2.2	
Measurement of dimensions
Overall dimensions of the bearings are required to be measured and compared with the 
actual dimensions to ascertain any excessive stress or strain on the bearing.
10.2.3	
Evidence of locked in condition
If any movable or rotating part of a bearing is found to be in locked-in / jammed condition, 
necessary rectification measures shall be taken immediately.
10.2.4	
Evidence of corrosion
If corrosion of any part of exterior exposed steel surface of the bearing is detected the 
following measures may be taken. In addition, the root cause of defect should be searched 
and proper actions should be taken to avoid recurrence of the problem.
	
- Detect affected part
	
- Wire brush the affected portion to clean of its rust.
	
- Apply protective coating as per manufacturer’s specifications.
10.2.5	
Condition of the adjacent bridge structure
The adjacent structure of the bearings are also required to be inspected for any damage and 
necessary actions to repair the same, should be taken immediately.
