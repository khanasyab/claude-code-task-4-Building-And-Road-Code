meeting held on 25th October, 2010. Subsequently, the draft was approved by the Executive 
Committee on 27th October, 2010. The document was considered by the IRC Council in 
its 192nd meeting held on 11th November, 2010 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) and approved the 
docoment.
2  SCOPE  AND  OBJECTIVE
This document deals with the functions and requirements of expansion joints for all types of 
bridges, various types of movements and rotations for which these joints are to be designed, 
guidelines on selection of a type of expansion joint depending on the magnitude and nature 
of movements of the deck in a specific situation, general and material specifications, testing 
and acceptance standards, guidelines on installation, inspection and maintenance, handling 
and storage, and the replacement of the joints.
The provisions of these guidelines are meant to serve as a guide to both design and 
construction engineers, but mere compliance with the provisions stipulated herein will 
not relieve them in anyway of their responsibility for the functional performance of the 
joint designed and erected. These guidelines limits itself to areas of direct relevance to 
the correctiveness needed in the basic approach to the problems and practice relating to 
expansion joints.
Various sketches given in the guidelines are indicative. Actual arrangement of the proprietary 
items depends upon the patented design and specifications of manufacturers.
In case of expansion joints for submersible bridges, special attention needs to be paid to 
durability under submerged conditions.
Users are requested to report the performance of different types of expansion joints to 
Indian Roads Congress so as to enable periodic review and updation of these guidelines.
3  FUNCTIONS
The first and foremost requirement of an adequate joint design is that the joint should be 
capable of accommodating all movements of the deck viz. translation and rotation. In the 
process, it must not cause unacceptable stresses either in the joint itself or in the structure 
by the way of restraint. A further requirement is a low noise level especially in an urban 
environment. The replacement of an expansion joint is always combined with a traffic 
interruption – at least on the affected lane. Therefore, expansion joints should be robust and 
suitable for all loads and local actions under all weather conditions. The replacement of all 
wearing parts should be possible in a simple way. In general, the expansion joints should 
perform the following basic functions:
 
i) 
Should permit the expansion/contraction of the span/spans to which it is 
fixed without causing any distress or vibration to the structure.



======================================================================

ii) 
Cause no inconvenience/hazard to the road user and offer good riding 
comfort.
 
iii) 
Should be capable of withstanding the traffic loads including dynamic 
effects.
 
iv) 
Be watertight and be capable of expelling debris without clogging/ 
without imparting higher force on the structure than what it is designed 
for. For this, it is desirable to have expansion joint extending for full width 
including the kerb as well as in footpath portion. However, specifications 
of joints provided in footpath and kerb may be different than that provided 
in the main carriageway portion.
 
v) 
Surface exposed to traffic should be skid free and resistant to polishing.
	
vi)	
Ensure accessibility for inspections and easy maintenance with all parts 
vulnerable to wear being easily replaceable.
 
vii) 
Any other function assigned to the expansion joint as per the specific 
requirements of the structural systems.
4  MOVEMENTS  AND  ROTATIONS
4.1	
The prime functional requirement of a joint is to cater for movements with very 
low resistance or with no resistance at all. Estimation of the joint movement, is therefore, the 
first design step. The most familiar and by far the biggest movement that the joint has to cater 
for is linear translation marked by opening and closing of the joint. Often the joint suffers 
rotational as well as transverse movement and out of plane vertical movement as shown in 
Fig. 4.a and 4.b.

4.2	
The design of deck joint is to be viewed as an integral part of structural design 
process. The estimation of deck joint movement, its magnitude and direction is determined 
by the design of supporting system. The plan geometry of the structure is obviously the most 
important factor in determining the horizontal movement at different points of the structure 
viz., at points of bearing support as also for deck joints. It is necessary to consider all 
translations and rotations to ensure that the displacements will not exceed the permissible 
design limits of the joint construction. Salient sources of joint movements may be broadly 
grouped into external load induced movements and internal volume changes of deck as 
given in Table 4.1.
Table 4.1  Salient Sources of Joint Movement
Sources of External load 
induced movements
Sources of Internal volume 
changes of deck
Horizontal loads transmitted to deck (traffic loads/climatic 
loads)
Ambient temperature
Displacement/rotation of deck edges induced by vertical 
traffic loads
Creep of concrete deck
Foundation/substructure movement (soil deformation, earth 
pressure etc.)
Shrinkage of concrete deck
4.3 
External load induced movements are transmitted to deck joint through rocking, 
sliding, rotation and elastic restraint of bearing and structure. When caused by transient 
traffic load these comprise low amplitude high frequency translation, rotation and vertical 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:69-2011
5
displacements. Traffic load induced movements are influenced by:
 
● 
Deck rigidity, geometry and statical system
 
● 
Traffic loading, Bearing type, location and behaviour
 
● 
Structural restraint of particular relevance to design and articulation 
system
In addition to traffic loads, external load induced movements may be caused due to 
exceptional loads like wind, earthquake, accidental structural damage, displacement etc.
4.3.1 
In the case of an elastic zero movement point, there are additional movements 
at expansion joints due to acceleration and braking forces. For decks supported on free 
elastomeric bearings at both end, the zero movement point is elastic (see Fig. 4.3.1.a). 
The zero movement point may also be elastic due to flexibility of pier. Moreover the actual 
rigidity of piers can differ from the planned rigidity. If a zero movement point is located on a 
tall substructure, the additional movements due to pier deformation must be considered in 
the structural analysis (see Fig. 4.3.1.b). If the bridge is fixed on more than one support, the 
position of the zero movement point may differ from the planned position.
Fig. 4.3.1.a
Fig. 4.3.1.b
4.3.2 
The support rotation of deck under the influence of traffic loads may cause 
movements and rotation at the expansion joint. The point of rotation of deck at support 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011

depends on the type of bearing on which it is supported. The vertical distance of the point 
of rotation from the plane of expansion joint and the magnitude of rotation are the factors 
influencing movements and rotation at the expansion joint (see Fig. 4.3.2).
Fig. 4.3.2
4.3.3	
Movement of substructure under the influence of traffic load due to sway effect 
etc. may cause movement and rotation at the expansion joints (see Fig. 4.3.3).
Fig. 4.3.3
4.3.4	
Fig. 4.3.4 shows a wall-type abutment on piling. For such a structure, it is 
generally assumed that the loads and forces above Plane A-A are resisted by piling below 
Plane A-A. Occasionally, passive earth pressure in the soil at the toe of the footing above 
Plane A-A is included in the analysis as providing resistance to the horizontal forces above 
Plane A-A. Accordingly, it is generally considered that Plane A-A is an absolutely rigid plane 
and the movement of the abutment with respect to Plane A-A due to loads and forces above 
Plane A-A is ignored. Moreover when sizing bridge deck joints, the abutments are considered 
as rigid substructures and the bridge seats and back walls as immovable surfaces. As a result 
of this simplified assumption, the bearings and deck joints are sized based only on the joint 
movements produced by superstructure length changes. Depending on the characteristics 
of the bearings, deck joints in such a structure should also take into account the anticipated 
abutment movements, which may occur early in the life of the structure.
4.3.5	
Movement may also be caused from the lateral and rotational movement of the 
abutment due to consolidation of the backfill, surcharge effect and active pressure exerted 
by the backfill soil.
4.4	
The sources of deck movement due to internal volume changes of deck are 
environment related. The low frequency, high amplitude movements are mainly translatory 
and predominate deck and joint movement.

Fig. 4.3.4
4.4.1	
It is also necessary, particularly for longer spans, to make a reliable judgement 
of bridge temperature during installation of joint and preset the joint accordingly to ensure 
as closely as possible to the condition that in the long run, at mean average temperature, 
the joint remains at its nominal state. The age of deck concrete from casting and/or pre-
stressing is also required to be considered for calculating the remnant creep and shrinkage 
and to apply necessary preset to the joint accordingly.
4.5	
The simplest plan geometry catered for and common is two-lane narrow straight 
deck. It will have movement parallel to longitudinal centreline. To determine the actual 
movement possible, the stationary point or the zero movement point has to be identified. 
The zero movement point will depend on structure geometry, location and type of bearings 
and piers as well as their stiffness. In general, the zero movement point is located on the 
centreline of straight deck by symmetry in such cases.
4.6 
In case of a curved bridge, the zero movement point may even fall outside the 
plan area. The location of the zero movement point determines the magnitude and direction 
of movement. As such a detailed analysis is necessary (see Fig. 4.6).
4.7	
Skew and curved wide bridges are common in modern highway system. Bridges 
curved in plan and skew are likely to have both longitudinal and transverse movement 
(Fig. 4.7.a and Fig. 4.7.b). Wide bridges may also tend to move transversely. This can lead 
to twisting of expansion joints and some transverse force on the joint and structure needing 
attention.
4.8	
Vertical translations can be caused by the geometrical conditions on the 
abutment, e.g. for bridge with longitudinal gradient and horizontal bearing seating (Fig. 4.8.a) 
for bridges with considerable cantilevering of deck over bearing at abutments (Fig. 4.8.b).

4.9	
Vertical translations can be caused during replacement of bearing (Fig. 4.9.a). 
Also, in the case of replacement of one single bearing on one side, a rotation will occur about 
longitudinal axis of the bridge (Fig. 4.9.b). However, it is possible to avoid this movement by 
uniform lifting over the cross-section.
	
Fig. 4.9.a	
Fig. 4.9.b
4.10	
The following factors shall be considered in determining force effects 
and movements. The design movement for expansion joint however need not cater for 
Earthquake and Dynamic effects since the expansion joint is a replaceable item and design 
life for expansion joint is much lower than the return period of earthquake forces:
 
i) 
Structural material properties, including co-efficient of thermal expansion, 
shrinkage, creep etc.
	
ii)	
Effective temperature range, installation datum temperature and 
extremes.
	
iii)	
Articulation system details including bearing, pier stiffness etc.
	
iv)	
Method and sequence of construction.
	
v)	
Tilt, probable settlement and movement of supports.
	
vi)	
Construction tolerances.
	
vii)	
Live load, wind and earthquake.
	
viii)	 Dynamic structural response, structural restraints.
 
ix) 
Provisions for future construction/rehabilitation work particularly for lifting 
of superstructure for replacement/resetting of bearings.
4.11	
Calculation of rotations and movements shall be done as per relevant IRC 
Codes and sound engineering practices.
5  BASIS  FOR  SELECTION  OF  TYPE  OF  JOINTS
The prime functional requirement of a joint is to cater to the maximum movement, from 
extreme positions of contraction and expansion, which is normally the longitudinal movement 
of the deck.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 56
======================================================================

The maximum opening of a joint will be determined by adding the maximum movement 
requirement to the minimum opening of joint in extreme closed condition.
Brief description of different types of joints with limitations of each type have been included 
in this section along with maximum opening capacity and rating of movement and rotation 
of each type to facilitate selection of the joints by the designer.
5.1	
Joints for Small Openings (Movement upto 25 mm)
Brief description of different types of joints for small movements (upto 25 mm), along with 
their limitations, are given below:
5.1.1	
Buried joint (movement upto 10 mm)
Burried joint consists of continuously laid bituminous/asphaltic surfacing over the joint gap 
bridged by a steel plate resting freely over the top surface of the deck concrete. The joint is 
suitable for short span structure. Typical buried joint is shown in Fig. 5.1.1.
Fig. 5.1.1 Buried Joint
Limitations of Buried Joint are:
 
● 
Prone to deterioration due to cracking and squeezing of bituminous 
surfacing and consequent bad riding quality.
 
● 
The road surfacing at joint location is required to be renewed frequently.
 
● 
Gradual rusting and deterioration of supporting steel plate because of its 
inaccessibility for maintenance.
5.1.2	
Filler joint (movement upto 10 mm)
The components of Filler joint shall be at least 2 mm thick corrugated copper plate placed 
slightly below the wearing coat, 20 mm thick compressible fibre board to protect the edges, 
20 mm thick pre-moulded joint filler, sealed with a joint sealing compound, filling the gap up 
to the top level of the wearing coat. Typical filler joint is shown in Fig. 5.1.2.
Limitations of Filler Joint are:
 
● 
Life of the joint is short. Compressibility of filler gets reduced with age 
and thus needs to be replaced soon.

5.1.3	
Asphaltic plug joint (movement up to 25 mm)
Asphaltic plug joints consists of a modified bitumen binder carefully selected single size 
aggregate, closure/bridging metallic plate and heat resistant foam caulking/backer rod. This 
joint is especially suitable for rehabilitation works. Typical asphaltic plug joint is shown in 
Fig. 5.1.3.
Fig. 5.1.2 Filler Joint
Limitations of Asphaltic Plug Joint are:
 
● 
Prone to deterioration due to flow of material in wheel path in high ambient 
temperature.
 
● 
The aggregate may get de-bonded from the bitumen matrix in winter with 
subsequent potholing under traffic.
 
● 
Possibility of de-bonding of the plug from the adjoining asphalt surface.
 
● 
Reliable indigenous source for binder etc. yet to be established.
 
● 
Incorrect placement of materials results in tearing of the adjacent 
carriageway pavement.
 
● 
Yielding of asphaltic material under the wheels of standing vehicles, brake 
and acceleration forces combined with high environmental temperatures 
and the development of rutting

5.2	
Joints for Medium Openings (Movement over 25 mm and upto 80 mm)
The absorption of medium openings requires an elastic expansion element or an expansion 
gap across the carriageway surface. For traffic safety, gaps in deck slab below 5 mm or over 
65 mm are not recommended. Thus, the expansion movement of a simple gap construction 
is limited to 60 mm. Expansion joints for medium openings consists of a sealing element, 
edge elements and fixing elements.
5.2.1	
Compression seal joint (movement upto 40 mm)
Compression seal joint consists of steel armoured nosing at two edges of the joint gap 
suitably anchored to the deck concrete and a preformed chloroprene elastomer/closed cell 
foam joint sealer compressed and fixed into the joint gap with special adhesive binder. The 
seal is supposed to remain in continual compression due to pressing of the seal wall against 
joint faces throughout the service life to ensure that the joint remains water tight and capable 
of repelling debris. Typical compression seal joint is shown in Fig. 5.2.1.
Fig. 5.2.1 Compression Seal Joint
Limitations of Compression Seal Joint are:
 
● 
Contact pressure of seal with steel nosing, which is the key to effective 
sealing mechanism, decay considerably with age. Hence more safeguards 
are required during installation for desired level of compression in the

Single strip/box seal joint (movement up to 80 mm)
Single strip/box seal expansion joint consists of two edge beams with anchorages and an 
elastomeric sealing element held firmly in the housings of edge beams that guarantee the 
water tightness of the joint. The maximum gap between the edge beams at road surface 
when the joint fully opens due to maximum contraction of deck shall be limited to 80 mm 
for comfortable passage of the traffic. The edge beams protect the adjacent bridge deck 
concrete from damage due to vehicular impact and also transfer the vehicular load to the

deck structure through robust anchorage system Typical single strip seal joint is shown in 
Fig. 5.2.2.1.
Seals of expansion gaps can be constructed as V-shaped sections (Fig. 5.2.2.2) or hollow 
sections (Fig. 5.2.2.3). Movements are absorbed by the opening/closing of these elements. 
Both shear headed stud type and loop type anchorage may be used.

Limitations of Single Strip Seal Joint are:
 
● 
Open surface gap tends to accumulate too much of debris on the strip 
seal element particularly near footpath and kerb.
 
● 
Noise generation during passage of vehicle over the open surface gap.
 
● 
Blocking of open surface gap by entrapped stones or hard pieces may 
generate locked-in condition restraining free movement of structure.
5.2.3	
Reinforced elastomeric joints (movement upto 80 mm)
This type of joint consists of reinforced elastomeric pads connected to a supporting steel 
structure which itself is cast into the concrete structure of the bridge. The joint accommodates 
movement by shear deformation of elastomer and opening and closing of grooves at upper 
and lower surface. The maximum movement is limited by the gap width. Typical reinforced 
elastomeric joint is shown in Fig. 5.2.3.
Limitations of Reinforced Elastomeric Joints are:
 
● 
In high volume and high-speed traffic areas the rubber surface of the 
bearing plate is susceptible to excessive wear which lowers the skid 
resistance.

● 
Since the reinforced elastomeric pads of most of the elastomeric joints 
are manufactured in 1 m to 1.5 m sections, there is a potential for water 
leakage at the tongue and groove splicing of the elastomeric pads in the 
case of improper installation.
 
● 
Additional water seal below the elastomeric seal is required for making it 
waterproof.
 
● 
Horizontal force offered by the joint and transmitted to the bridge structure 
may be considerable due to the high resistance of the elastomeric 
elements.
5.3	
Joints for Large Openings (Movement over 80 mm)
5.3.1	
Modular strip/box seal joint
The modular strip/box seal expansion joint divides the total movement capacity into several 
smaller gaps. The joint consists of two edge beams, one or more central/separation beams 
or lamellas oriented transversely to the traffic direction forming the load carrying elements, 
and cross beams supporting individual or multiple central beams to transfer the loads to 
the bridge deck through the anchorage system. Centre beams and transverse support/
cross beams are connected by resilient or shock absorption system to dampen dynamic 
loading, thus reducing the forces transmitted to the structure and anchorages. The shock 
absorption system accommodates vertical and transverse movements apart from longitudinal 
movement. The joint also contains gap control system, which allows closing and opening 
of the joint and ensures that all modules open or close equally. The joint is made watertight 
through mechanically locked sealing system of elastomeric strip seals connected between 
the lamellas. The gap width between the consecutive centre beams at the joint surface shall 
be limited to 80 mm when the joint opens fully due to maximum contraction of deck. Typical 
details of a modular strip seal expansion joint are shown in Fig. 5.3.1.
Limitations of Modular Strip/Box Seal Joint are:
 
● 
Numerous movable parts susceptible to fatigue and wear.
 
● 
Open surface gap tends to accumulate too much of debris on the strip 
seal element particularly near footpath and kerb.

● 
Noise generation during passage of vehicle over the open surface gap 
between transversely located center beams.
 
● 
Mechanically operated gap control system can lead to poor functioning of 
the joint, particularly when individual gaps are blocked by stones or other 
hard pieces.

5.3.2	
Finger joints
The cantilever-toothed joint (Fig. 5.3.2.1) also called finger joint, is a very robust construction 
but with several disadvantages. The deformation capacity in the crosswise direction is severely 
limited and vertical deformations of the joint can prejudice traffic safety. To accommodate 
small vertical deformations without hazard, the free finger ends should be rounded. Finger 
joints with supported fingers (Fig. 5.3.2.2) have proved to be not as good as with cantilever 
fingers.

Limitations of Finger Joints:
 
● 
Additional arrangements are required for making it water-proof.
 
● 
It induces lot of noise.
 
● 
It cannot accommodate differential vertical movement and high transverse 
movements.
5.3.3	
Reinforced coupled elastomeric joint
This type of joint consists of reinforced elastomeric pads connected to a supporting steel 
structure which itself is cast into the concrete structure of the bridge. The joint accommodates 
movement by shear deformation of elastomer and opening and closing of grooves at upper 
and lower surface. This joint can take up movement upto 230 mm. Typical Reinforced 
coupled elastomeric joint is shown in Fig. 5.3.3.
Limitations of Reinforced Coupled Elastomeric Joint are:
 
● 
In high volume and high speed traffic areas the rubber surface of the joint 
is susceptible to excessive wear, which also lowers the skid resistance.
 
● 
Since the reinforced elastomeric pads of most of the slab seal joints are 
manufactured in 1 m to 1.5 m sections, there is a potential for water 
leakage at the tongue and groove splicing of the elastomeric pads in the 
case of improper installation.
 
● 
Additional water seal below the elastomeric seal is required for making it 
water proof.
 
● 
Horizontal force offered by the joint and transmitted to the bridge structure 
may be considerable due to the high resistance of the elastomeric 
elements.
5.4	
Suggested Criteria for Adoption of Different Types of Expansion Joints
Primary basis of selection of any joint shall depend on the movement capacity of that joint 
in relation to the specific requirement of the particular structure. Designer may select the 
type of joint depending on the form/movement/rotation as indicated in Table 5.4.1. No joint 
is necessary up to 6 mm movement of the joint. It is recommended that mixing of different 
type of joints in any particular structure should be avoided. However, single gap strip seal 
joint and modular strip seal joint shall be regarded as the same type.

Notes :	
For movements larger than those indicated in the above table, reference may be 
made to specialized literature for the design/selection of a suitable joint which is site 
specific.
 
For skew and curved bridges and bridges having significant transverse movements of 
the decks, special design requirements are necessary.
6  SPECIAL  TYPES  OF  JOINTS
This section of the guideline is aimed to provide general information to attend special 
requirements of very high longitudinal movement, high transverse movement, special detailing 
of joints for high seismic zones, special low noise modular joint system and requirement of 
anti-skid surface for very large modular strip seal joints. For joints for very high longitudinal 
and transverse movement, only specialized manufacturers having proven experience in 
design, manufacture and supply of such joints shall be consulted from the design stage to 
evolve a foolproof system design most suitable to the structure and site conditions, climatic 
variables and other requirements to ensure proper execution and performance of the joint.
	
a)	
Very high longitudinal movement: In design and construction of very 
large and complex bridges, expansion joints to cater for very large 
longitudinal movement are required. Specially designed modular strip 
seal/box seal expansion joint is the most suitable type for such cases.
	
b)	
High transverse movement: For long span bridges and/or sharply 
carved bridges and in high seismic zones the transverse movement may 
also be considerably higher. Specially designed modular strip seal/box 
seal expansion joint is the most suitable to cater for very high transverse 
movement. The requirement of high transverse movement can be met 
by special detailing of joints e.g. using wider and deeper control boxes to 
allow high transverse movement.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011
19
	
c)	
Joints for high seismic zones: For long span bridges in high seismic 
zones modular strip seal expansion joints equipped with seismic fuse box 
duly tested in a test laboratory may be used to isolate the joint from the 
structure during earth quake and thereby avoiding designing the joints 
for high additional movement in case of earthquake. Such isolation with 
seismic fuse ensures lesser damage to the joint and also the structure 
during earthquake. Typical detailing of seismic fuse is shown in Fig. 6.3.
Fig. 6.3  Typical detailing of Seismic Fuse
	
d)	
Noise reduction: Noise reduction becomes increasingly an issue for 
densely populated areas. The idea of this newly developed expansion 
joint combines the advantages of the normal modular expansion joint 
with the advantage of the finger joint. It is achieved by welding or bolting 
sinusoidal plates, which are called noise leaves, on the top of the 
center/lamella beams. The over-rolling tyre cannot bang anymore on a 
transversal edge. It now rolls along a curved, diagonal line, with the result 
that the tyre of the passing vehicle cannot develop noise with the same 
strength as on transversely oriented beams. Test results show that the 
noise development can be reduced by 80 percent.
	
e)	
Joints with anti-skid surface: Large modular expansion joints for 
extremely long span bridge structures require a special safety concept to 
ensure secure rollover of all kind of traffic, while ensuring safe transmission 
of braking force but preventing skidding of vehicles on the exposed steel 
surface of the joints. While smaller expansion joints require only coating 
for corrosion protection, very large modular expansion joints require 
special treatment of the exposed joint surface. A friction coefficient of 0.5 
between coating and rubber must be ensured for a service life time under 
all weather conditions and neither pollution nor excessive radiation from 
sunlight should reduce the long term quality of the special anti skidding 
coating. For modular strip seal joints with movement capacity larger than 
1000 mm the exposed steel surface should be provided with anti skid 
coatings.

This section serves as a general guideline for installation of Expansion Joints. 
Expansion Joints should always be installed under thorough supervision of the manufacturer’s/
supplier’s engineer in order to ensure the quality of installation so that expansion joints 
function as intended during their entire life span. Detailed Installation Manual should be 
supplied by the joint manufacture.
9.2 
The design of an expansion joint is performed by determination of the extreme 
values of the expected movements and the position of installation. The installation data 
depends on the planned construction sequence.
9.3	
Taking the width of gap for movement of the joint into account, the dimensions 
of the recess in the decking shall be established in accordance with the drawings or design 
data of the manufacturer.
9.4	
Detailing of structure should be done with due consideration of the type of 
joints, movement capacity, presetting detail, recess dimension required for installation, 
requirement of reinforcements and its detailing to avoid removing or cutting off interfering 
reinforcing bars during installation.
9.5 
The presetting of expansion joint may be done by means of an auxiliary 
construction.
9.6 
It is recommended to lay the road surfacing/wearing coat before commencing 
installation of joint. Before laying wearing coat the recess portion shall be filled with sand 
and wearing coat shall be laid in a continuous manner over the deck slabs and recess 
portion. Prior to the installation of the joints, portion of wearing coat over the recess shall 
be removed by a suitable method e.g. saw cutting and the infill sand shall be removed 
subsequently.
9.7	
Preparation of the Recess
The recess must suit in size and form to the geometry of the expansion joint. However, the 
width shall not be less than the specified value for a particular type of joint. In order to avoid 
difficulties during installation, the following points must be checked and considered:
 
● 
Dimension check of recess
 
● 
Check of the levels
 
● 
Check of the skew and slope
 
● 
Check of the designed gap between bridge deck and abutment and/or 
between adjoining decks.
 
● 
Checking of the existing structural reinforcement according to the 
drawings.

Missing rebars must be replaced by inserting bars penetrating sufficiently deep into the 
concrete. Rebars that would obstruct the installation of the expansion joint should be bent to 
accommodate the expansion joint anchorages. Removing or cutting off interfering reinforcing 
bars shall only be done after consultation with the engineer in charge.
The recess shall be cleaned thoroughly. If necessary, the surface should be roughened. 
All loose dirt and debris shall be removed by wire brushing, air blowing and dried with hot 
compressed air.
9.8	
Shuttering
Shuttering must be used to seal the space between the underside of the joint and the 
vertical face of the recess. The shuttering must be fitted in such a way that it forms an 
appropriate seal against the edge of the recess. The recess shall be shuttered in such a way 
that dimensions in the drawing are maintained. The formwork shall be rigid and firm.
9.9	
Placing in the Recess
Level marks must be set next to the recess by the installation engineer. This enables a 
controlled levelling of the expansion joint. Lowering the expansion joint/joint construction/
insert etc. into the recess should be done in such a way that the entire length of the joint 
is evenly lowered into the recess. Thereafter, the joint/joint construction/insert is precisely 
levelled and adjusted in the longitudinal, transverse and vertical planes. If required, the joint/
joint construction/insert must also be adjusted to the gradient of the final surface level. As 
soon as the joint/joint construction/insert is accurately placed, the engineer in charge shall 
provide a written confirmation of the correct placement of the same.
9.10	
Connecting
9.10.1 
It is recommended to install the expansion joint/joint construction/insert in the 
early morning when the temperature is distributed almost uniformly over the whole bridge. 
Immediately before the installation, the actual temperature of the bridge should be measured. 
If it is not within the considered tolerance, the present adjustment must be corrected. The joint/
joint construction/insert shall be lowered in a predetermined position. Following placement 
of the joint/joint construction/insert in the prepared recess, the joint/joint construction/
insert shall be levelled and finally aligned and the anchorage steel on one side of the joint 
welded to the exposed reinforcement bars of the structure. Upon completion, the same 
procedure shall be followed for the other side. With the expansion joint/joint construction/
insert finally held at both sides, the auxiliary brackets shall be released, allowing it to take 
up the movement of the structure. After carrying out the final fixing, the protection against 
corrosion is completed.

9.10.2 
For fully assembled joints with one end fixed and other end movable e.g. 
modular strip/box seal joint, connection is detailed below:
9.10.2.1	
The 1st Side
The fixed side of the assembled joint (either the abutment or the bridge deck side) is 
designated the 1st side for connecting the joint. The preliminary fixing is made by evenly 
placing then welding of rebars over the entire length between the anchor loops and the deck 
reinforcement. To facilitate concreting, it is recommended that the gap between recess and 
shuttering is sealed by a grout seam. The seam must be left to dry prior to final concreting. 
After this, additional rebars are welded until all anchor loops are firmly connected to the 
deck reinforcement. The expansion joint is sufficiently fixed when no vibrations are noted 
when lightly bouncing on the joint.
The extent of the fixing of the expansion joint described above is not designed to accept 
dynamic load from traffic. It serves only to firmly pin the expansion joint in the recess until 
the concrete has been poured and sufficiently cured. It is, therefore, vital that the expansion 
joint is not subjected to any loads that could in any way displace the precise location of this 
fixing.
9.10.2.2	
The 2nd Side
Depending on the size of the expansion joint and the expected movement during the 
installation, the most suitable time must be determined for the fixing of the 2nd (moveable) 
side. Usually this is the early morning hours with the smallest temperature deviations. The 
procedure is identical to that at the 1st side. As fast as possible, preferably with several fitters 
at the same time, the joint is provisionally fixed to the reinforcement.
Immediately afterwards, the fixation brackets must be removed. The expansion joint can 
now follow the longitudinal movement of the bridge.
Thereafter, the gap between recess and shuttering should be sealed with grout seam and 
the remaining rebars should be welded as described previously.
9.11	
Concreting
9.11.1 
Prior to final concreting, the position of the joint/joint construction/insert must 
be recorded. The Engineer-in-charge must give written confirmation of the correct position of 
the joint and the recess concreting. The recess must be thoroughly watered. This prevents 
too much water draining from the fresh concrete. Before pouring the concrete the joint 
construction should be protected by a cover. Controlled concrete having strength not less 
than that in superstructure subject to the minimum of M 35 shall be filled into the recess. 
The water cement ratio shall not be more than 0.4, if necessary admixtures may be used 
to improve workability. The filling concrete must feature low shrinkage. Good compaction 
and careful curing of concrete is particularly important. The freshly placed concrete is to be 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011
39
properly vibrated. Damage to the shuttering must be avoided during vibration. The filling 
concrete must be finished flush with the carriageway surfacing. It is recommended that the 
concrete is kept damp until it has cured in order to avoid fissures caused by drying too fast. 
After the concrete has cured, the movable installation brackets and shuttering still in place 
shall be removed.
9.11.2 
For Modular strip seal joint the space beneath the joist boxes must be completely 
filled with concrete. This ensures that traffic loads are safely transmitted into the structure. 
Incorrectly placed concrete and/or cavities beneath the joist boxes will lead to damage of 
the joint.
9.12	
As soon as the concrete in the recess has become initially set, a sturdy ramp 
shall be placed over the joint to protect it from site traffic. Expansion joint shall not be 
exposed to traffic loading before completion of carriageway surfacing in any case.
9.13 
The elastomeric sealing element may be field installed. For strip seal and modular 
strip seal joints the sealing element should be in continuous lengths spanning the entire 
roadway width. Proper fit of the seal of the sealing element must be ensured. The seal shall 
be installed without damage to the seal by suitable hand method or machine tools.
9.14	
Specific Procedure for Asphaltic Plug Joint
9.14.1 
The recess in the deck slab, if required, shall be repaired with epoxy mortar 
and cleaned and dried again.
9.14.2 
The foam caulking/backing rod shall be placed about 25 mm down into the 
joint opening.
9.14.3	
The aggregate shall be washed, cleaned and heated to a temperature between 
120 – 180ºC prior to placement.
9.14.4	
The binder shall be preheated to temperature of 170-190ºC before 
application.
9.14.5	
While sealing the joint opening with preheated binder, care shall be taken that 
the binder does not spill on to the joint surface of the deck.
9.14.6	
The joint shall not be installed when the ambient temperature goes below 
+5ºC or above +35ºC or while it is raining/snowing (Planning for installation must take into 
account the weather condition).
9.14.7	
When element weather resumes, the joint installation may be continued after 
the upper layer and/or exposed surface of the partially completed joint has been prepared 
by heating and/or coating with binder as necessary.

10  INSPECTION  AND  MAINTENANCE
10.1	
This section serves as a general guideline for inspection and maintenance 
of Expansion Joints during service period. Expansion Joints should be designed and 
manufactured to make it maintenance free to the extent possible. Detailed inspection & 
maintenance manual should be supplied by the joint manufacture in order to ensure that the 
expansion joints function as intended during their entire life span. Starting with the day of 
installation, the Expansion Joint components are continually exposed to natural elements, e.g. 
temperature changes, rain, snow, moisture, ozone, carbon dioxide and ultraviolet rays and 
elements that are introduced by humans, e.g. traffic impact, chemical influences, industrial 
pollutants and the like. The combined effect of these elements on the joint components is 
a steady and unavoidable deterioration process. Regular inspection and maintenance are 
vital measures for durability of the expansion joint.
10.2	
Suitable easy access to the underside of the joint shall be provided for inspection 
and maintenance.
10.3 
Inspection of Expansion Joints at site is required from time to time to ascertain 
the performance of the Joints. Periodic nominal maintenance of joints shall be carried out in 
order to ensure better performance and longer life of the joints. The Joints are required to 
be inspected at an interval of one year for the first five years and at an interval of two years 
thereafter. However the Joints shall also be examined carefully after unusual occurrences 
like heavy traffic, earthquakes, cyclones and battering from debris in high floods.
10.4	
The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning of the joints as well as 
its surrounding space, depending on the actual conditions of the joints e.g. deposit of salt, 
debris, dust or other foreign material.



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011
43
10.5	
Elements of Inspection
It is necessary that gaps are maintained properly and surface treatment given on adjacent 
areas should exclude laying of wearing coat, i.e. covering of gap should be prevented. 
The following are recommended inspection elements and actions which are considered 
necessary to monitor and upkeep the Joints.
10.5.1	
Debris accumulation in the joint gaps, if any
The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning of the expansion joints to permit free 
movement. Remove incompressible clogging of the joint due to debris accumulation. All 
inaccessible accumulated foreign objects shall be cleaned either by pressurized air or by 
water Jet. It is to be noted that high water pressure (above 100 bar) or heated water (above 
25ºC) are to be avoided.
10.5.2	
Riding comfort over the joints
The alignment of the Joint is a helpful indicator of the general behavior of the superstructure 
and substructure concerning movements as tilting, rotation etc. In general the deviation of 
the alignment can cause a reduction of the driving comfort for vehicle crossing or can have 
a negative influence on the Joint system as a whole.
The points required to be inspected with care are:
	
-	
The alignment in transverse direction (referring the joint)
	
-	
The vertical alignment measured along longitudinal direction with respect 
to the level of adjacent road surface
The alignment in transverse direction shall be measured with a 4 m straight edge. The 
deviation between the joint and straight edge should not be more than 5 mm. The vertical 
alignment measured along longitudinal direction with respect to the level of adjacent road 
surface should not be more than 3 percent.
10.5.3	
Measurement of movement
During inspection at site, measurements are required to be taken and documented to 
compute its movement and rotation values in relation to their design values to ascertain 
whether the performance of the joints is satisfactory. To ascertain maximum movement, 
measurement should be taken once during peak winter (early morning) and once during 
peak summer (afternoon) and corresponding atmospheric temperature should be recorded. 
The recorded value of movement shall be compared with the design values.
10.5.4	
Measurement of dimensions
The dimensions of the joints are required to be measured and compared with the original 
dimensions to ascertain any excessive stress or strain on the joints.

IRC:SP:69-2011
44
10.5.5	
Evidence of locked in condition
If any movable or rotating part of a joint is found to be in locked-in/jammed condition, 
necessary rectification measures shall be taken immediately. Distribution of width of surface 
gaps (if any) provided to accommodate movement should be checked over the length of 
the joint. Any abnormal variation of surface gap width over the length of the joint and/or the 
distribution of gap width beyond the design limits, if detected, the joints should be thoroughly 
checked for the locked in condition in order to detect mechanical obstruction and possible 
remedial measures should be taken immediately.
10.5.6	
Evidence of corrosion
The condition of the corrosion protection shall be checked carefully. Damages detected and 
repaired early will certainly avoid expensive repairs at a later date. If corrosion of any part 
of exterior exposed steel surface of the joints is detected, the following measures may be 
taken. 
	
-	
Detect affected part
 
- 
Wire brush the affected portion to clean of it’s rust.
 
- 
Apply protective coating as per manufacturer’s specifications.
In addition, the root cause of the defect should be analysed and proper action be taken to 
avoid recurrence of the problem.
10.5.7	
Condition of the adjacent bridge structure
The bridge structure adjacent to the Joint shall be examined for the following common 
defects, which may lead to further damage of the joint. If damages are detected they must 
be repaired as soon as possible to avoid further extension of the damage.
	
-	
Spalled concrete
	
-	
Broken off edges
 
- 
Cracks or fissures in the structure
	
-	
Rust spots on the concrete surface
 
- 
Exposed reinforcement
The concrete/asphalt nosing adjacent to expansion joint must be free of damages in order 
to ensure a smooth passage of the traffic without heavy shocks. This increases the lifespan 
of the expansion joint considerably.
10.5.8	
Condition of the elastomeric units/sealing component
The condition of the elastomeric units/seals shall be carefully inspected to uncover possible 
defects as under:-
	
-	
Loose
	
-	
Torn



======================================================================

-	
Split
	
-	
Cracked
	
-	
Damaged
	
-	
Cut
If any one of the above defects appears, remedial actions should be taken, the degree 
of which depends on the prevailing defects. In general following remedial actions are 
possible:
	
-	
Cleaning
	
-	
Servicing
	
-	
Replacing the damaged part
10.5.9	
Water tightness-evidence of leakage
Leakage of water together with temperature and chemical reaction might be a reason for 
following damages beside an unpleasant appearance:
	
-	
Destruction of the bridge structure, broken concrete
	
-	
Corroded steel parts, e.g. reinforcement, drainage pipe.
	
-	
Rust staining, dirt staining.
If evidence of leakage is detected remedial actions must be taken by replacing the sealing 
element or applying sealing element as per the instruction of the joint manufacturer or 
tightening the loose components depending upon the cause of the leakage.
10.5.10	
Evidence of noise
Abnormal rollover noises generated by the joint under traffic load can be regarded as the 
indicator for the condition of the joint and also for the adjacent bridge structure. Abnormal 
noise may be caused by loosened and/or damaged joint components, loosened bolts, metal 
to metal contact due to damage of joint components. If such an abnormal noise is noticed, the 
origin of the noise should be probed first and depending upon that, remedial works shall be 
taken up by tightening the loose fastenings and/ or replacing the damaged components.
10.5.11	
Visible damage of the joint components
Any visible damage of joint component, welded and bolted connections as well as connection 
of joint with bridge structure if detected during inspection, proper remedial measures should 
be taken immediately in consultation with joint supplier.
Results and actions: The results of every inspection have to be recorded in the inspection 
report and shall be classified in each case into the following types of action:
	
i)	
No action.



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011
46
	
ii)	
Further measurements/long-term monitoring or design analysis needed 
(e.g. considering extreme temperatures/exposures, variation of loads 
etc.). Actions to be outlined in a report.
	
iii)	
Minor repair works e.g. cleaning, repainting etc.
	
iv)	
Repair or replacement of entire joint or components of the joints. Actions 
to be outlined in a report. In case of defects where the cause of necessary 
actions cannot be determined by the inspecting person or the responsible 
bridge engineer, the Expansion Joint manufacturer should be consulted.
11  HANDLING  AND  STORAGE
11.1	
All the aggregates and binder for the Asphaltic Plug Joints shall be pre-bagged 
and clearly marked. All the material shall be stored on concrete platform at 150 mm above 
the ground in covered enclosures to avoid contamination.
11.2 
The expansion joint materials shall be handled with care and stored under 
cover on suitable lumber padding.
11.3	
All joint material and assemblies shall be protected from damage and 
assemblies shall be supported to maintain true shape and alignment during transportation 
and storage.
11.4 
For transportation and storage, auxiliary brackets shall be provided to hold the 
joint assembly together, especially for single strip/modular strip/box seal joints.
11.5 
The manufacturer/supplier shall supply either directly to the Engineer or to the 
Bridge Contractor complete joint with all the materials and accessories including sealants 
and all other accessories for the effective installation of the joints.
12  REPLACEMENT  OF  THE  EXPANSION  JOINTS
12.1	
Replacement of expansion joints is difficult once they are laid. Therefore, it is 
desirable that the joints should perform satisfactorily during the entire service life. So it is 
advisable that the client may ensure guarantee or proprietary indemnity bonds or financial 
guarantee from the manufacturers/suppliers of expansion joints for a reasonable period, for 
satisfactory in-service performance. This period may be about ten years.
12.2	
A complete replacement is necessary if the steel parts of the joint exhibit 
advanced fatigue damage. However, replacement of joint on concrete bridge deck is 
extremely difficult and expensive.



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 56
======================================================================
IRC:SP:69-2011
47
12.3	
More frequent is the replacement of single member, especially elastomeric 
components. Seals should be easily replaceable. The modular strip/box seal joints should 
be detailed to make all components are replaceable from top of carriageway.
12.4 
For replacing the components of single/modular strip/box seal expansion joints, 
the gap width must be opened to at least 25 mm. In the case of an elastic linkage, smaller 
widths are possible because the rails can be displaced. On the other hand the seals must 
not be stretched fully. Expansion joints for large movements should be accessible from the 
underside to change members of the linkage like elastomeric elements.
12.5 
Though the seals may be repaired by vulcanization on site it should be avoided 
and total replacement of the seal should be opted. If a replacement of the rails becomes 
necessary they can also be joined on site. However, the joints should be situated in zones 
with minimal stress range and must be welded very carefully because of the high fatigue 
loads.
12.6 
It is recommended that irrespective of the validity or expiry of the performance 
guarantee period for the joints, the original manufacturer/supplier should also be consulted/
involved in the process of replacement of the joints.
12.7 
While replacing an expansion joint, the requirement of any other suitable type 
of joint (other than one proposed to be replaced) may be examined keeping in view the 
expected movements.
