Guidelines for Fabrication and Erection of Steel Bridges
INTRODUCTION
A need was felt during the deliberation on IRC:24 to have some Guidelines for Fabrication 
and Erection of Steel Bridges, since more and more steel bridges are being fabricated and 
erected for road use in our country.
The present document has been prepared for fabrication, incorporating the various items 
like testing of materials, preparatory works for fabrication and joining by welding, riveting and 
bolting.
It has also been considered necessary to add a few chapters on erection dealing with 
precautions safety measures, loads and forces to be taken note of and other issues considered 
relevant.

While transferring the mark, hard stamping shall be carried out in those area that are allowed 
by the engineer.
1.4	
Storage and Handling of Materials
Raw steel shall be stored free from dirt, foreign matter and shall be protected from 
corrosion and distortion. All materials and consumables, including raw steel, shall be stored 
specification wise and size wise above the ground. The materials shall be stored on platforms, 
skids or on other supports. Floors shall have a light slope to allow proper drainage of water. 
Fabricated components shall be stacked neatly above ground with clear visibility of the match 
mark as shown in the part list. The electrodes shall be stored in dry and warm condition and 
in properly designed racks, specification wise. The bolts, nuts, washers and other fasteners 
shall be stored on racks above the ground in gunny tags and with protective oil coating. The 
paint shall be stored under cover in airtight container. Raw steel shall be handled by using 
lifting beam with proper slings in a manner so as to cause minimum damage or distortion of 
the plates and structural. Fabricated components shall be handled and stacked in a manner 
that is not subject to any deformation.
1.5	
Workmanship and Quality Assurance Plan
QAP shall be prepared according to the nature of fabrication. QAP shall elaborate nodal points 
of checking and inspection during different stages of fabrication. This shall be submitted to 
the engineer for his approval. Fabrication shall be taken up after the approval of the QAP 
by the Engineer. All fabricated components shall carry mark number and the serial number. 
Method of marking shall commensurate with the process of manufacturing and shall ensure 
retention of identity at all stages.
1.6	
Straightening and Flattening
Steel materials such as plates and structural’s shall have straight edges, flat surface and 
be free from twist. Straightening/flattening of the plates and structural’s are required to be 
carried out for making good of deformation and distortion that may have occurred during 
rolling or handling operation. Structural sections can be straightened by presses, preferably 
hydraulic. Plates can be flattened by presses or straightener consisting of series of rollers. 
Pressure applied for straightening of flattening shall be such that it does not injure the material. 
Hammering shall not be permitted. Deformations caused at the time of handling can be 
removed by application of heat, hydraulic/gradually applied mechanical force.
Heating temperature shall not be more than 650ºC. Heating and cooling rate shall be pre-
determined and applied to steel only after consultation with the engineer.
1.7	
Layout for Camber
A full scale layout for the girder shall be done on a leveled bed and as per the drawing on 
the basis of nominal length of the members. Jigs for gussets and members shall be made 
from the layout. The position of the holes and their angular settings shall be as per the 
nominal layout. In case of small plate girders, where camber is not provided, the length of the 
members shall be taken from the drawing.

Long span of open web girders have provision of camber. The drawings show two diagrams. 
One is the diagram for nominal layout and the other is the camber diagram. A full scale layout 
for the girder shall be done on leveled bed, as per the diagram for nominal layout in the 
drawing. Jigs for gussets and members shall be made from the nominal layout. The position 
of the holes and their angular settings shall be as per the nominal layout. The length of the 
members shall be manufactured as per the corresponding length in the camber diagram. The 
machining of the ends shall be done to ensure proper contact of the members at the joints.
1.8	
Bending
1.8.1	
Cold Bending
Cold bending of steel having yield stress 360 MPa or more shall not be done. The bend plate 
orientation shall be done in a manner that the bend line shall be approximately perpendicular 
to the direction of rolling. Materials with non specified kinks or sharp bends, cracks, large 
dents or visible reductions of section (necking) shall not be used. Visual inspection of all the 
load points and for suspected damaged places, magnetic particle testing shall be done. For 
bend plates, the use of the largest bend radius that is permissible shall be ensured.
1.8.2	
Heating and Bending
Heating shall be done before painting. The stresses due to pre-load (including loads 
induced by member weights) shall be limited to 0.5 fy where fy is the normal yield strength 
(y/s) of the materials. When jacks are used, the load shall be applied and locked off before 
applying heat. For heating, orifice tip shall be fixed for neutral flame and its tip size shall be 
proportional to the thickness of the materials used. The heating torches shall be manipulated 
to guard against over-heating. When V-shaped/straight regular heat patterns are used, the 
patterns shall be marked on the steel prior to heating. The steel shall be brought to planned 
heating temperature as rapidly as possible without over-heating. Care shall be taken against 
buckling when thin or wide plates are heated. The temperature shall be monitored with temp. 
– sensitive crayons, pyrometer or infra-red non-contact thermometers. The temperature shall 
be measured within 5-10 seconds after the heating flame leaves the test area. Cooling of the 
steel with compressed air, passing through dryers for removing moisture, is permitted only 
after the steel has cooled below 315ºC. Cooling shall not be done with water or mist.
Steel shall be allowed to cool below 120ºC before applying another set of heating pattern.
For curving or cambering by V-shaped heating pattern, a location shall be re-heated after 
completion of three sets of heating patterns at adjoining locations. Application temperature 
shall be done under controlled procedure and not more than 650ºC. Accelerated cooling shall 
not be done unless approved by the Engineer-in-charge.
Material to be heated shall be properly supported. The material shall not yield before or 
during application of heat.
1.8.3	
Heat Curving of Bridge Member
The procedure of application of heat shall be approved by the engineer. Care should be 
taken to ensure that the stress due to pre-load does not exceed 0.5 fy where fy is the normal

y/s of the material. Heat curving shall be done before attaching longitudinal stiffener. When 
radius is more than 300 Meters for heat curving, pre-loading of the web shall be done prior 
to heating. When the web is heat curved in vertical position, sufficient support shall be given 
to avoid lateral deflection during heat curving process. The member should not over turn or 
twist. To prevent buckling and excessive local deformation, intermediate catch blocks should 
be maintained. Heating pattern shall be planned and applied along the length of the member 
to produce the specified curvature. Enough patterns shall be used to eliminate visually 
detectable chording effect. Heat curving shall not be done when the radius of curvature is 
less than 300 meters, flange thickness exceeds 75 mm or when the flange width exceeds 
750 mm.
For rolled sections heat curving methods can be applied after taking approval of heating 
procedure from engineer. It is not possible to give camber by heating in plate girders. Web 
should be cut to prescribed camber. Suitable allowance for shrinking due to cutting and 
welding should be provided.
1.9	
Cutting and Edge Preparation
Edge preparation shall be done by anyone of the following prescribed methods for Plate and 
Structural’s.
Shearing, cropping, sawing, flame cutting with subsequent grinding.
Wherever possible, the edges shall be cut in shearing machine which will take the whole 
length of the plate in one cut. Sheared edges of plate shall be ground to a smooth profile for 
secondary use such as stiffeners and gussets. When used as stiffeners, they shall be ground 
so that the maximum gap is less than 0.2 mm in 60 percent of contact area.
Sawing can be effectively used for structural Steel.
1.9.1	
Flame Cutting
Hardness of cut edge should not exceed 350 BHN after flame cutting. The material to be 
removed after flame cutting shall be to the extent of 2 mm or minimum necessary to ensure 
that the edge is less that 350 BHN hardness. When hardness increases beyond acceptable 
limit, even after material removal, the flame cut edge shall be heat-treated by the method 
approved by the Engineer for bringing the hardness to 350 BHN. It has to be ensured by 
dye penetration or magnetic particle test that cracks have not developed at the cut edges. 
All flame cut edges shall be ground to obtain reasonably clean, square and true edges. Drag 
lines produced by flame cutting shall be removed. Outside edge of plates and sections, which 
are prone to corrosion, shall be smoothened by grinding.
Use of flame cutting machine, having multiple oxy acetylene torches, is desirable for reducing 
the distortion due to cutting operation and for higher productivity. Plasma-arc-cutting method 
is preferable as this process offers less heat input and causes less distortion.
1.10	
Planing and Machining
Machining of the edges or surface shall be carried our when specified in the drawings or 
where specifically instructed by the Engineer. Plates and Sections up to a thickness of 12 mm

shall be cut to a size 3 mm or more and in plates and sections exceeding 12 mm, a thickness 
of 6 mm or more than the finished size shall be cut for carrying out the finishing operations.
After completion of fabrication the butting ends of the members shall be smoothened by an 
end milling process to ensure uniform gap/proper contact as may be necessary. In the case 
of compression members the machined faces should be at right angle to the axis of the 
members and in contact as specified.
At the discretion of the Inspecting Officer, a tolerance of 0.4 mm may be permitted at isolated 
places on the butting line.
1.11	
Rivet and Bolt Holes
Holes for rivets, black bolts, high strength bolts and countersunk bolts/rivets (Excluding close 
tolerance and turn fitted bolts) shall be either punched or drilled. The diameter of holes shall 
be 1.5 mm larger for bolts or rivets up to 25 mm Ø and 2.0 mm for bolt & rivets more than 
25 mm Ø.
All holes shall be drilled except for secondary members such as, floor plate, handrails 
etc., and the members which do not carry the main load. The punching shall be done in 
materials whose yield stress, fy, does not exceed 360 MPa and thickness does not exceed 
(5600/fy) mm.
When holes are required to be made in a pack of plates/plates and structural’s in material 
grade E250 (FE 410 w) with thickness more than 20 mm or grade E350 (FE 440) with thickness 
more than 16 mm, the drilling shall be done up to a diameter which is 3 mm less than the 
required size of the hole. The under sized holes shall then be reamed to full diameter. The 
reaming of materials shall be done after assembly.
For bolts of close tolerance or turn fitted bolts, the diameter of the holes shall be upto 
+ 0.15 mm to 0 mm, of the diameter of the bolt shank. The members to be connected with 
close tolerance or turn fitted bolts shall be firmly held together by service bolts, clamped 
and drilled through all thickness in one operation. The reaming to required size within the 
specified limit of accuracy, shall be done subsequently.
For HSFG joints, all holes shall be drilled after, removal of burrs. Where the number of plies 
in the grip does not exceed three, the diameters of holes shall be 2.0 mm larger than those of 
bolts. For more than three plies in grip, the diameters of hole in outer plies shall be as above 
and diameter of holes in inner plies shall be not less than 1.5 mm and not more than 3.0 mm 
larger than the bolt diameter, unless otherwise specified by Engineer.
1.12	
Bolted Connection
All joint surfaces, for bolted connection, shall be free of scale, dirt, burrs, foreign material and 
all such defects that prevent solid seating of parts. The slope of surface of bolted parts in 
contact with bolt head and nuts shall not exceed 1:20, in the plane normal to bolts otherwise 
suitable tapered washer shall be used.
All fasteners shall have a washer under nut or bolt head, whichever is turned in tightening.

Each fastener of joint shall be tightened by hand wrenches/impact wrenches. Calibrated 
torque wrenches (manual/digital) shall be used for final tightening.
When turn of nut method is used for tightening the bolts in joint, first all bolts shall be brought 
to “snug tight” condition, (that is tightening by full effort of man using ordinary wrench or by 
few impacts of any impact wrench). All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened additionally by 
applicable amount of nut rotation specified below for guidance.

be as per relevant IS specifications unless otherwise mentioned in the drawing or required 
by the Engineer. Bolted connections of joints using high tensile friction grip bolts shall comply 
with requirements mentioned in IS:4000. Bolted Connections.
Reference should be made to Appendix-J for selection, usage, installation and testing 
procedures.
1.14	
Riveted Connection
Assembled riveted joint surfaces including those adjacent to the rivet head shall be free of 
scale, dirt, loose scale, burrs, other foreign material and defects that would prevent solid 
seating of parts.
The part/members to be riveted shall be firmly drawn together with bolts, so that the sections 
riveted are in close contact throughout. Every third hole of the joint shall have assembly bolts 
till riveted. Drift shall be used only for matching of holes of the parts/members but not to the 
extent as to distort the holes.
While riveting built-up members, great care should be taken to ensure that the set of holes 
for field rivets in each flange of the built up member, is aligned dead-square in relation to that 
in the other flange and not abrogated. Use of assembly fixture shall be made to ensure this 
drift of larger size than the diameter of the drilled holes shall not be used.
Rivets shall be heated uniformly to a “light cherry red color” between 650ºC to 700ºC for 
hydraulic riveting and “orange colour” for pneumatic riveting of mild steel rivets. High tensile 
steel rivets shall be heated upto 1100ºC. The head of the rivet, particularly in long rivets, shall 
be heated more than the point. Sparking or burnt rivets shall not be used.
Rivet shall be driven in hole when hot so as to fill the hole as completely as possible and shall 
be of sufficient length to form a head of the standard dimension. When countersunk head

is required the head shall fill the countersunk hole. Projection after countersinking shall be 
ground off where necessary.
The riveting shall be done by hydraulic or pneumatic machine unless otherwise specified by 
Engineer. The head can be held by pneumatic holding device. Where, it is impossible to back 
up by normal method of holding up, double gunning method may be resorted to. The working 
pressure to be applied, when using pneumatic or hydraulic tools, shall be approved by the 
engineer.
Any rivet due to defect in head size or head driven off the centre shall be removed and 
replaced. The method of removal of the defective rivet shall ensure that, the members of the 
joint are not damaged in the process.
The parts not riveted in the shop shall be secured by bolts to prevent damage during 
transportation and handling.
1.15	
Welded Connection
1.15.1	
General
Over welding is a common defect in fabrication industry. Excessive welding does not 
necessarily increase the strength of a welded joint. On the contrary, it increases the stresses 
in a highly restrained joint. There are many criteria for the selection of an edge preparation 
and they are :
	
*	
Ease of assembly.
	
*	
Resistance to lamellar tearing.
	
*	
Weld inspection by radiography, ultrasonic etc., testing methods.
The joint preparation must be designed.
	
*	
To allow full approach of electrode.
	
*	
To have minimum deposition of weld metal.
	
*	
To have access for welding and inspection.
	
*	
To be linked to the welding process.
1.15.2	
Weldability of Steel
The weldability of steel depends on its susceptibility to cracking during and after welding. The 
amount of carbon in the metal has a considerable influence on the weld ability of structural 
steel. The weldability is expressed by Carbon Equivalent (CE) of the material based on ladle 
analysis. The CE is determined from the following expressions:
CE = C + 
Mn
+
Cr + Mo + V
+
Ni + Cu
6
5
15
The lower the CE better is the weldability. For general structural steel, the CE value should 
preferably be not more that 0.45 to ensure good weldability. Steel with higher CE are also 
weldable with special electrodes, weld designs and procedures. Though CE does not take 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
12
into account, Sulphur and Phosphorus, the presence of more that 0.06 percent of these 
constituents will have deleterious effect on welding.
If the Carbon Equivalent exceeds a particular limit, there exist a possibility of cracking in 
the Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ). Hard, brittle martensite, cracks are likely to develop. This 
phenomenon is called under bead cracking. The high thermal cycles accelerate the formation 
of HAZ cracking. Presence of hydrogen in the weld is another potential factor in the formation 
of under bead cracking. The principal factors governing the risk of HAZ cracking in steel 
are :-
	
*	
Compatibility of Weld metal composition with parent metal.
 
* 
Pre-heat temperature according to CE (carbon equivalent).
 
* 
Hydrogen Content in the form of ingredients in the flux.
	
*	
Cooling rate (heat input, joint type, thickness).

structural steel.

1.15.4	
Welding Processes
Generally, Manual Metal Arc-welding, Submerged-Arc Welding, (Automatic & Semi Automatic) 
Gas shielded Arc welding etc., are used in bridge fabrication.
The various types of welds are Fillet, Butt, Plug, Spot and Seam welds. The two most popular 
types of welding for structural purpose are fillet and butt joints.
1.15.5	
Fusion Faces
The preparation of fusion faces, angle of preparation root radius and root face shall be as 
specified in IS:9595 and IS:4353. Where the gap between the root faces of a butt joint is 
excessive, the gap shall not be bridged since this procedure often leads to cracking. The 
fusion faces of the joint shall be built-up with weld metal to give the appropriate gap before 
the weld is commenced.
The preparation of fusion faces, angle of bevel, root radius and root face shall be such that 
the limits of accuracy required by the appropriate application standard can be achieved. 
When however, no appropriate application standard exists and this guide lines is itself to 
be used, it is recommended that, for manual welding, the tolerances on limits of gap and 
root face should be ± 1 mm on the specified dimensions for material upto and including 
12 mm thick and ± 2 mm for material over 12 mm thick. The tolerance on the included angle 
between the fusion faces of a V preparation is recommended to be ± 5 degree and for 
U and J preparations ± 10 degree. For an automatic process, closer limits are necessary and 
particular requirements depend on the characteristics of the process.
It shall be ensured, if necessary, by suitable non-destructive tests that the fusion faces and 
adjacent surfaces shall be free from cracks, notches or other irregularities which might be the 
cause of defects or would interfere with the deposition of the weld.
Fusion faces and the surrounding surfaces shall be free from heavy scale, moisture, oil, paint 
or any other substance which might affect the quality of the weld or impede the progress of 
welding. Certain proprietary protective coatings are specially formulated with the intention 
that they should not interfere with welding. The use of such coatings is not excluded by the 
requirements of this clause but shall be demonstrated by means of specimen welds that the 
coating complies with the above requirements.
1.15.6	
Assembly for Welding
Parts to be welded shall be assembled such that the joints are easily accessible and visible 
to the operator. Jigs and manipulators shall be used, where practicable, so that the welding 



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
14
can be carried out in the most suitable position. Jigs shall maintain the alignment with the 
minimum restraint so as to reduce the possibility of locked in-stress.
1.15.7	
Structural Details
Changes in section shall be gradual and notch-like corners shall be avoided.
Attachment of fittings and making openings at locations of severe fatigue stress shall 
preferably be avoided.
Packing’s - Where a packing is used between two parts, the packing and the welds connecting 
it to each part shall be capable of transmitting the load between the parts, except where the 
packing is too thin to carry the load or permit the provision of adequate welds, when it shall be 
trimmed flush with the edges of the narrower part and the load shall be transmitted through 
the welds alone, the welds being increased in size by an amount equal to the thickness of 
the packing.
1.15.8	
Arrangement of Welds
Fillet welds at right angles to the lines of principal stresses in a plate subjected to tension 
shall be avoided in dynamically loaded structures.
Accumulation of weld joints in a single location shall be avoided (See Appendix H, Fig. H-20)
Sizes or lengths of fillet welds shall be sufficient to provide for better distribution of stress. 
Excessive sizes or lengths shall not be specified.
1.15.9	
Safety Precautions
Provisions of IS:818, IS:1179 and IS:3016 shall generally apply for safety and health 
requirements during welding operations.
1.15.10	
Approval and Testing of Welding Procedures
Welding procedure test shall be carried out in accordance with IS:7307 (Part-1) to 
demonstrate, by means of a specimen weld of adequate length on a steel representative 
of that to be used, so as to confirm that satisfactory weld is achievable with the welding 
procedure to be used for fabrication.
Provisions of IS:9595 and IS:4353, shall generally be followed, as applicable, for welding 
procedure, details of workmanship, correction of weld faults, penning, painting, etc. In case 
any of the provisions contained therein contravene the provisions made in this guideline, the 
code shall be followed.
In addition to the provisions of IS:4353 the Inspector may, where deemed necessary, require 
a sample joint having the same cross-section as the joint to be used in construction and a 
length of at least 300 mm to be welded with the wire, flux current, arc voltage and speed of 
travel that are proposed to be used and a macro etched cross section of the welded joint 
prepared as a demonstration that the specified requirements will be met, when the welding 
current, arc voltage and speed of travel are established by a test made in accordance with 
requirements of this clause, they shall be kept within the following limits of variations:

Welding current ± 10%
	
Arc Voltage ± 7%
	
Speed of travel ± 15%
1.15.11	
Approval and Testing of Welders
The welders shall be trained in accordance with IS:817. The welders shall be subjected to 
appropriate qualifying tests specified in IS:7310 (Part-1).
1.15.12	
Welding Procedures
Welding work shall be given to an agency who does produce satisfactory evidence of his 
ability to handle the work in a competent manner. The agency shall also prove the ability of 
the operator/welders employed by him to produce welds of the required strength. The agency 
shall employ a competent welding supervisor to ensure that quality of materials and the 
standard of workmanship comply with the requirements laid down in this guideline.
The sizes and length of welds shall not be less than those specified in the drawings nor shall 
they be substantially in excess of the requirements without prior approval of the Engineer. 
The location of welds shall not be changed without prior approval of the Engineer. Welds 
shall preferably be made in flat position.
In case of welds in structures subjected to dynamic loading, adequate means of identification, 
either by identification stamp or other records shall be provided to enable each weld to be 
traced to the welding operator by whom it was made.
During the cooling of the weld the joints shall not be subjected to any external forces or 
shocks.
Freedom of movement of one member of a joint shall be allowed wherever possible. No butt 
joint shall be welded without allowing one component, freedom of movement of the order of 
1.5 mm.
In making welds under conditions of severe external shrinkage restraint, the welding shall be 
carried out with electrodes having type 6 covering as per IS:814.
In case of welding using direct current, earthing on the work piece to be welded shall 
be connected carefully at more than one location with a view to avoid “Arc Blow” during 
welding.
All welds should be done by submerged arc welding process either fully automatic or semi-
automatic. Carbon-dioxide (CO2) welding or manual metal arc welding may be done only for 
welds of very short runs or of minor importance or where access of the locations of weld does 
not permit automatic or semi-automatic welding.
Neither the depth of fusion nor the maximum width in the cross section of weld metal 
deposited in each weld pass shall exceed the width of the face of the weld pass. 
(Appendix-H, Figs. H-21 & H-22).

1.15.13	
Sequence of Welding
The sequence of welding shall be such that when possible the members, which offer the 
greatest resistance to compression, are welded first.
The welding in the thinnest element of a section (usually the web in case of beams) shall be 
done prior to the welding of the thicker elements (usually the flanges in case of beams).
In making butt welded joints in rolled shapes, the sequence and procedure of welding shall 
take into account unequal amount of expansion or contraction in elements being welded.
Splices in each component part of a solid web girder or built-up member shall be made 
before such component part is welded to other component part of the member.
1.15.14	
Position of Welding
For fabrication of steel bridge girders the following positions of welding shall be adopted.
	
i)	
Flat and horizontal position for Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)
	
ii)	
Horizontal or horizontal-vertical position for welding done using Manual Metal 
Arc Welding (MMAW) or Co2 Welding.
Note:	 Different positions have been shown diagrammatically in Appendix-H, Fig. H-23.
All butt welds by the submerged arc process shall be made in the flat position. Fillet welds 
may be made in either flat or horizontal-vertical position. The size of the single pass fillet 
welds made in the horizontal-vertical position shall not exceed 8 mm.
1.15.15	
Tack Welds
Tack welds shall be not less than the throat thickness or leg length of the root run to be used 
in the joint. The length of the tack weld shall not be less than four times the thickness of the 
thicker part or 50 mm whichever is the smaller.
Where a tack weld is incorporated in a welded joint, the shape, size and quality shall be 
suitable for incorporation in the finished weld and it shall be free from all cracks and other 
welding defects. Tack welds, which are prone to cracking, shall be cut out and re-welded.
Tack welds shall not be made at extreme ends of joints.
1.15.16	
Inter-Run Cleaning
Each run of weld bead shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove particles of slag, spatters, 
etc. before the subsequent bead is super-imposed during multi-pass welding. Similarly, 
each layer of weld should be thoroughly cleaned of slag, spatters, etc, before depositing 
subsequent layers of weld with particular reference to thorough cleaning of toes of the welds. 
Visible defects, such as cracks, cavities and other deposition faults, if any, shall be removed 
to sound metal before depositing subsequent run or layer of weld.
1.15.17	
Stray Arcing on Work
Stray arcing shall be avoided as this can leave local hard spots or cracking which are to 
be removed by mechanical means and be checked by inspection depending upon the 
application.

Butt Welding
	
a)	
Forms and details - All details of butt welded joints shall be in accordance 
with IS:9595 and IS:4353 as applicable.
	
b)	
Unsealed butt welds of single V,U,J and bevel types and incomplete 
penetration butt welds shall not be used. Sketches of different types of butt 
weld are given in (Appendix-H, Fig. H-1)
	
c)	
Intermittent butt welds shall not be used.
Sealing or Backing
 
a)  
Single V, U, J bevel or square butt welds shall generally be completed by 
depositing a sealing run of weld metal on the back of the joints.
	
b)	
Where it is not practicable to deposit a run of weld metal on the back of 
the joint, then single V, bevel or square butt welds, welded from one side 
only, may be permitted, provided that another steel part of the structure or 
a special steel backing strip is in contact with the back of the joint and the 
edges of the steel parts of the joint are prepared as specified in IS:9595 or 
IS:4353, whichever is applicable, to ensure complete fusion of the parts to 
be joined.
	
c)	
In all full penetration butt welds which are to be welded from both 
sides, the back of the first run shall be gouged out by suitable means to 
clean sound metal, before welding is started on the gouged out side 
(Appendix-H, Fig. H-2).
Butt Welding Parts of Unequal Cross-Section
	
a)	
In butt welding steel parts in line with each other which are intended to 
withstand dynamic forces, and which are of unequal width, or where the 
difference in thickness of the parts exceeds 25 percent of the thickness of 
the thinner part or 3 mm whichever is greater, the dimensions of the wider 
or thicker parts shall be reduced at the butt joints to those of the smaller 
part, the slope being not steeper than 1 in 5 (Appendix-H, Fig. H-3). Where 
the difference in thickness of the parts does not exceed 25 percent of the 
thickness of the thinner part or 3 mm whichever is greater, the transition 
of thickness shall be accomplished by sloping weld faces (Appendix-H, 
Fig. H-4) by chamfering the thicker part or by combination of the two methods 
(Appendix-H, Fig. H-5), at an angle not steeper than 1 in 5.
	
b)	
Where the reduction of the dimensions of the thicker part is impracticable, 
and/or where structures are not designed to withstand dynamic forces, the 
weld metal shall be built-up at the junction with the thicker part to dimension 
at-least 25 percent greater than those of the thinner part, or alternatively, to 
the dimensions of the thicker member (Appendix-H, Fig. H-6).

Butt Welded T Joints - Butt weld in T joint shall be reinforced by welding as shown in 
(Appendix-H, Fig. H-7). Flange to web connection will also fall under this category.
Ends of butt welds - The ends of butt joint shall be welded so as to provide the full throat 
thickness. This shall be done, in all cases of parent metal more than 20 mm thick and 
preferably in other cases also, by extending the ends of the butt welds past the edges of 
the parts joined by the use of run-on and run-off plates with a similar joint preparation and of 
reasonable thickness not less than the thickness of the part joined and of the length not less 
than 40 mm (Appendix-H, Fig. H-8). If run on and run off plates are removed after completion 
of the welds, the ends of the weld shall be finished smooth and flush with the edges of the 
abutting parts. Run on and run off plates are to be removed after completion of welds by

Erection Scheme and Erection Procedure
2.2.1	
General Considerations
The construction methodology, types of equipment to be used use and other relevant 
information relating to the erection scheme shall be intimated to the engineer for his 
approval.
While preparing erection scheme, provision for wind loads shall be made according to local 
conditions. Ground conditions should be stable enough to ensure that the temporary supports 
do not settle during erection.
Span erected upon staging shall be supported upon suitable blocks and camber jacks. Care 
shall be taken to ensure that the girders are erected at the correct elevation, alignment and 
camber, when completed.
When chains are used for lashing, care must be taken to protect the edges of members from 
denting and distortion.
Proper method shall be used for lifting and slinging of flexible members to ensure that 
permanent deformations are not made.
Erection work shall start only when resources, as per approved scheme, are available at site 
and the foundations for supports are ready for taking the load.
In works of erection involving high volume, mechanization to the possible extent, shall be 
adopted.
The structure shall be divided into modules. Before erection the modules shall be pre-
assembled in a suitable yard/platform and its matching with members of the adjacent module 
shall be checked.
Where erection has to be carried out on a difficult terrain, the trial assembly of the girder 
should be done and simulated load shall be applied to study the effect.
The supporting structure shall be set out to the required lines and levels. Sufficient packing 
materials should be available at site to start erection. The erection of the girder shall be 
completed with sufficient drifts and bolts and in the required position.
2.2.2	
Plants and Equipment
Capacity chart for each crane configuration and boom length should be studied in detail and 
placement of the crane planned accordingly.



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 89
======================================================================

IRC:SP:104-2015
33
Periodical inspection of the crane and other lifting equipment shall be made to ensure that the 
equipments are in working order. The lifting gear and machinery should have the periodical 
load testing certificate and declared fit for service by authorized personnel only.
Prior to actual commencement of erection all equipment, machinery, tools, tackles, shall be 
load tested and witnessed by the engineer, to ensure their efficient working.
Appendix-I, illustrates some typical lifting tools, tackles and lifting methods.
2.2.3	
Temporary Works
All temporary work shall be properly designed and constructed for construction loads. 
Temporary bracing shall be provided to take care of rigidity during erection.
2.2.4	
Inspection and Testing Prior to Erection
Visual inspection is essential in vulnerable areas to detect displacements, distress, damages 
etc.
Deflection tests shall be conducted in respect of supporting structures, launching truss as 
also the structure under erection. Any looseness of fittings or unusual behavior shall be noted 
and adequate precautions taken.
Safety requirements shall conform to IS:7205 and IS:7293.
Organized “Quality Surveillance” checks shall be exercised intermittently.
For erection Inspection checklist see Appendix-L.
2.2.5	
Lifting and Assembling
Planned systems for achieving and maintaining stability at all times during construction 
shall be fully detailed in the method statement which should contain precise step-by-step 
instructions.
These shall be indicated on the detailed working drawings and given to the erection 
supervisor.
Any special or unusual features of the structural design which may affect stability during 
erection shall be highlighted and emphasized on drawings which shall form part of the method 
statement.
The ground on which the crane shall stand must be firm, leveled and free from obstruction. 
All outriggers must be fully extended, jacked and locked.
The crane shall be leveled before attempting the lift and in many cranes there may be ‘level 
bubble’ which can be used to satisfy this condition.
Before using the equipment the safe working load shall be considered and shall be inspected 
for defects, if any including excessive wear and tear.
2.2.6	
Bearing and Anchorages
Bed plates shall be set to required level and fixed accurately in position by giving full and 
even bearing by setting them on a layer of cement sand and cast iron chips as approved and 
directed by the engineer.



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
34
The holes shall be drilled , where necessary, and the anchor bolts set. The bolts shall be set 
accurately and fixed with cement grout or any other grouting material, as approved by the 
Engineer to completely fill the holes.
2.2.7	
Cambering for Erection of Open Web Girders
The joints of the chords shall be drifted, bolted and preferably riveted to their geometric 
outline.
All other members are to be elastically strained into position by external forces, so that as 
many holes as possible are fair when filled with rivets.
Drifting of joints shall be avoided as far as possible, and when necessary, should be done 
with great care and under close expert supervision. Hammers not exceeding one kg in weight 
shall be used with turned barrel drifts and a number of holes drifted simultaneously, the effect 
of the drifting shall be checked by observation of adjacent unfilled holes.
The first procedure during erection consists of placing camber jacks in position on which the 
structure shall be supported. The camber jacks shall be set with their tops level, and with 
sufficient run out to allow for lowering of panel points except the centre by the necessary 
amounts to produce the required camber in the main girders. It is essential that the camber 
is accurately maintained throughout the process of erection and it should be constantly 
checked. The jacks shall be spaced so that they shall support the ends of the main girders 
and the panel points. The bottom chord members shall then be placed on the camber jacks, 
carefully leveled and checked for straightness and the joints made and riveted up.
The vertical and diagonal web members, except the posts, shall then be erected in their proper 
positions on the bottom chords It is recommended that temporary top gussets, the positions 
of the holes in which are corrected for the camber change of length in the members, should 
be used to connect the top ­ends of the member this will ensure that the angles between the 
members at the bottom joints are as given by the nominal outline of the girders. The vertical 
and diagonal shall then be riveted/bolted to the lower chords.
All panel points, except the centre, shall now be lowered by amounts to produce the correct 
camber in the main girders as shown on the camber diagram.
The top chord should be erected piece by piece working symmetrically from the centre 
outwards, and the joint made by straining the members meeting at the joint and bringing the 
holes into correct position.
The temporary gussets, if used, shall be replaced by the permanent gussets in the same 
sequence as the erection of the top boom members.
The end posts shall be erected last. The upper end connection should preferably be made 
first and if there is no splice in the end raker, the final closure made at the bottom end 
connection. If there is a splice, the final closure should be made at the splice.
When cantilever method of erection is used, the above procedure does not apply.

2.3	
Joints
2.3.1	
Bolted Joints
No joint shall be assembled for bolting until the contact surface have been properly inspected 
to ensure that they are free from dirt ,scales and other foreign materials.
Each bolt and nut shall be assembled with at least one washer. A washer, conforming to 
Clause 502.4 of IRC:24, shall be placed under the rotating component.
Where the angle between the axis of the bolt and the joints surface is more that 3 degree 
off normal, a tapered washer shall be used against the tapered surface. The non-rotating 
components shall preferably be placed against the tapered washer.
The nut should be placed so that the mark to identify a high strength nut is visible after 
tightening.
Packing shall be provided wherever necessary to ensure that the load transmitting plies are 
in effective contact when the joint is tightened to the ‘snug-tight’ condition. All packing shall 
be of steel with a surface condition similar to that of the adjacent material.
The holes in the parts to be joined shall be aligned to permit the bolts to be positioned without 
damage to the threaded portion of the bolt. Drifting to align holes shall not distort the metal 
or enlarge the holes.
Snug tightening and final tensioning of the bolts shall proceed from the stiffest part of the joint 
towards the free edges.
High strength bolts, conforming to IS:3757, may be used temporarily during erection to 
facilitate assembly. They shall not be finally tensioned until all bolts in the joint are snug-tight 
in their correct sequence.
Re-tensioning of bolts which have been fully tensioned shall be avoided wherever possible. 
If re-tensioning must be carried out it shall only be permitted once and only when the bolt 
remains in the same hole in which it was originally tensioned and with the same grip.
Under no circumstances shall bolts, which have been fully tensioned, be reused in another 
hole.
2.3.2	
Riveted Joints
All rivets shall be properly and uniformly heated to straw heat for the full length of the shank. 
The head of the rivet, particularly in long rivets, shall be heated more than the point. Sparking 
or burnt rivets shall not be used. Pneumatic/hydraulic operated dolly and riveting gun should 
be used for holding the rivet head and forming the rivet head at the point end.
Where support is not available to hold the rivet head by pneumatic/hydraulic operated dolly 
or any other mechanical method, head forming of the rivet should be done by utilizing two 
riveting gun, operating simultaneously, from both ends of the rivet.
Gauges for rivet dimensions and contours shall be provided by the contractor for the use of 
the Inspecting Officer.



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015

Rivets when driven shall completely fill the hole. The formed head of the rivet should be 
concentric with the shanks and shall be in full contact with ply surface. Driven rivets shall be 
free from movement or vibration, when struck sharply on the head with the 110 gm. Rivet 
testing hammer. While riveting built-up members great care should be exercised to ensure 
that the set of holes for field rivets in each flange of the built-up member, is aligned dead-
square in relation to that in the other flange and not abrogated.
All loose, burnt, head cracked, badly formed, eccentric and deficient head rivets shall be cut 
out and replaced. Rivets shall also be cut out when required for the examination of the work. 
Actual method of cutting out shall be approved by the Engineer.
Recapping and caulking should not be done.
Riveting shall be started when the Engineer gives permission after personally satisfying 
himself about the correctness of the assembly, the suitable cambering and proper alignment 
of the girder and ensuring about the tightening of service bolts and concentricity of field rivet 
holes.
Special care should be taken that service bolts are frequently re-tightened as the riveting 
proceeds. All field rivets shall be tested as directed by the Engineer.
Where practicable all riveting shall be done by pneumatic or hydraulic riveting machine. The 
working pressure to be used for the riveting shall be accepted by the Engineer.
Hand riveting shall only be done when sanctioned by the Engineer. In such cases, means 
shall be adopted to ensure the rivets being used fill the rivet holes completely, the snap is 
used only to give the correct head formation.
When all the rivets of joints have been finally passed, they shall be painted as under:
One coat of ready mixed Zinc Chrome Primer to IS:104 followed by one coat of ready mixed 
paint red oxide zinc chrome primer to IS:2074.
Finishing coat should be done at the time of final painting.
2.3.3	
Welded Joints
Any connection to be site welded shall be securely held in position by approved means to 
ensure accurate alignment, camber and position before welding is commenced.
Weld Procedure Specifications (WPS) shall be prepared and got approved by the engineer. 
All weldings are to be carried out as per IS 816/IS 9595 with suitable consumables, as 
approved in the WPS. All welds shall be sound and shall conform to Clause No 512.4.4 of 
IRC:24.
For welded connections, welders qualification are to be done as per relevant IS code.
Non-destructive tests (NDT) of joints as per designer’s directives are to be carried out.
Precision non-destructive testing instruments available in the market should be­ used for 
noting various important parameters of the structures frequently and systematic record 
should be kept.

APPENDIX - E
Specification for Metallising with Sprayed Aluminium for Bridge Girders
(Refer Clause 1.18.3)
E 1	
Surface Preparation
The surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and roughened by compressed air blasting or 
centrifugal blasting with a suitable abrasive material in accordance with Clause 3 of IS:6586 
immediately, before spraying. It shall be free from grease, scale, rust, moisture or other foreign 
matter. It shall be comparable in roughness with a reference surface produced in accordance 
with Appendix-A of IS:5905 and shall provide an adequate key for the subsequently sprayed 
metal coating.
E 2	
Metal Spraying
The metal spraying shall be carried out as soon as possible after surface preparation but in 
any case within such period that the surface is still completely clean, dry and without visible 
oxidation. If deterioration in the surface to be coated is observed by comparison with a freshly 
prepared metal surface of similar quality which has undergone the same preparation, the 
preparation treatment should be repeated on the surface to be coated.
The wire method shall be used for the purpose of metallising, the diameter of the wire being 
3 mm or 5 mm. Specified thickness of coating shall be applied in multiple layers and in no case 
less than 2 passes of the metal spraying unit shall be made over every part of the surface. At 
least one layer of the coated to the specified thickness within 8 hours of blasting.
The chemical composition of aluminum to be sprayed shall be 99.5 percent aluminium 
conforming to IS:2590. The surface of the sprayed coating shall be of uniform texture and 
free form lumps, coarse areas and loosely adherent particles. The nominal thickness of the 
coating shall be 150 μ (microns). The minimum local thickness, determined in accordance 
with procedure given in Clause E.5.1 below, shall be not less than 110 μ (microns).
E 3	
Shop Painting
Any oil, grease or other contamination should be removed by through washing with a suitable 
thinner until no visible traces exist and the surfaces should be allowed to dry thoroughly before 
application of paint. The coatings may be applied by brush or spray. If sprayed, pressure 
type spray guns must be used. One coat of wash primer, one coat of Zinc chrome primer to 
IS:104 with the additional provision that Zinc chrome to be used in the manufacture of primer 
shall conform to type 2 of IS:51, shall be applied. After hard drying of zinc chrome primer, one 
coat of Aluminum paint to IS:2339 (brushing or spraying as required) shall be applied.
E 4	
Site Painting
After the steel work is erected at site a second cover coat of Aluminum paint to IS:2339 
(brushing or spraying as required) shall be applied after touching up the primer and the cover 
coat given in the shop if damaged in transit.

E 5	
Inspection
E 5.1	
Equipment
Any magnetic or electro-magnetic thickness meter that will measure local thickness of a 
known standard with an accuracy of ± 10 percent shall be used. The meter shall be checked 
on one of the following standards.
	
i)	
A soft brass shim, free form burrs, in contact with the grit blasted surface 
of the base metal prior to its being sprayed. The thickness of the shim shall 
be measured by micrometer and shall be approximately the same as the 
thickness of the coating.
	
ii)	
A sprayed metal coating of uniform known thickness of approximately the 
same as the thickness of the sprayed coating to be tested, applied to a base 
of similar composition and thickness.
E 5.2	
Procedure
For each measurement of local thickness, an appropriate number of determinations shall 
be made, according to the type of instrument used. With instrument measuring the average 
thickness over an area of not less than 0.645 cm2, the local thickness shall be the result of 
the one reading. With instruments having one or more pointed or rounded probes, the local 
thickness shall be the mean of three readings within a circle of 0.645 cm2 area. With meters 
having two such probes, each reading shall be the average of two determinations with the 
probes reversed position.
E 5.3	
Method of Test for Adhesion
Using a straight edge and hardened steel scriber which has been ground to a sharp 30 degree 
point, scribe two parallel line at a distance apart equal to approximately 10 times the average 
coating thickness. In scribing the two lines, apply enough pressure on each occasion to cut 
through the coating to the base metal in a single stroke. If any parts of the coating between 
the line breaks away from the base metals, it shall be deemed to have failed the test.
Articles, which have been rejected shall have the defective sections blasted clean of all 
sprayed metal prior to re-spraying. Where the rejection has been solely due to too thin a 
coating, sprayed metal of the same quality may be added provided that the surface has been 
kept dry and is free from visible contamination.

APPENDIX - G
Procedure for Providing Plug Welds
(Refer Clause 1.15.24)
The holes shall be tapered to ensure adequate root penetration.
Welding shall generally be carried out in flat position using a copper block plate of 25 mm 
minimum thickness as a backing surface. This plate shall have a depression of about 3 mm 
at the center and in the line of the hole.
For welds to be made in the flat position, the arc shall be carried round the root of the joint 
and then carried along spiral path to the center of the hole fusing and depositing a layer of 
weld metal in the root and bottom of the joint. The arc shall then be carried to the periphery of 
the hole and the procedure repeated, fusing and depositing successive layers to fill the hole. 
The slag covering the weld metal shall be kept molten, or nearly so, until the weld is finished. 
If the arc is broken, except briefly for changing the electrodes, the slag must be allowed to 
cool and be completely removed before starting the weld.
For welds to be made in the vertical position, the arc shall be started at the root of the joint, at 
the lower side of the hole, and carried upwards along a zig zag path depositing a layer about 
5 mm thick on the exposed face and fused to the side of the hole. After cleaning the slag from 
the weld, subsequent layers shall be similarly deposited to fill the hole.
For welds to be made in the overhead position, the procedure shall be the same as for the flat 
position except that the slag shall be allowed to cool and shall be completely removed after 
depositing each layer until the hole is filled.
All plug welds shall be finished with reinforcement of about 3 mm which shall then be dressed 
flush.

APPENDIX - J
HSFG Bolt and Installation Process
(Refer Clause 1.13)
J 1	
Types of Bolts: For the purpose of HSFG connections, only high strength structural 
bolts can be used. IS 4000 gives two property Classes : 8.8 and 10.9 for the same. Bolts shall 
conform to IS 3757. The bolts have the following characteristics:
J 2	
Property Class: A property class has two parts separated by a decimal in the form 
x.y. The first part, x, indicates 1/100 of the nominal tensile strength in Newton per sq. mm 
and y indicates ten times the ratio of the lower yield stress and nominal tensile strength. For 
example, property Class 8.8 means that the bolt will have nominal Ultimate Tensile strength 
of 800 N/mm2, and lower yield stress of 80 percent of 800 N/mm2, i.e. 640 N/mm2.
J 3	
Identification: The property class of bolts (8.8 or 10.9) shall be embossed 
or indented as 8S or 10S respectively on the top of head along with the manufacturer’s 
identification symbol. Alternately, marking ‘8.8 S’ or ‘10.9 S’ are also acceptable. The suffix 
‘S’ here denotes that the bolt is high strength structural bolt with a large series hexagon.
Fig. J-1  Typical Marking on Bolt Heads
J.1.3	
Diameter: IS 4000 gives diameters of HSFG bolts as M16, M20, M24, M30 and 
M36. Other sizes given in IS 1367 include M18, M22 and M27 (Referred to as ‘non-preferred’ 
sizes also). For bridge works, these can be used and M22 size is readily available in the 
market.
J.1.4	
Length: The length of bolt shall be chosen such as to hold the steel members in 
position, with provision for the nut, washer(s) and some projection beyond the bolt. Along with 
the overall length of the bolt, the thread length has to be specified. At least 4 full threads shall 
remain clear between the bearing surface of the nut and unthreaded part of the shank 3 (This 
means that at least 4 threads shall extend into the members being joined by the bolt). Further, 
minimum one full thread pitch must protrude from the nut after tightening. The minimum 
length of bolt shall be worked out on the basis of maximum grip length covering maximum 
limits of ply thickness plus an additional allowance given in Table 1 of IS: 4000. Table 1 of 
IS 4000 is reproduced below:

For M 22 bolts, the allowance for grip shall be 34 mm. Most manufacturers have ready tables 
for the bolt lengths depending upon the steel plates to be gripped. Still, it will be prudent 
on the part of the field Engineer to cross check the computations before ordering the bolts. 
Maximum grip length of all plies, including packing’s and packing washers, shall not exceed 
10 times the nominal diameter of the bolt.
J 1.5	
Surface Finish: All bolts shall be supplied with coating consisting of zinc phosphate 
that is used in conjunction with suitable oil of rust preventive type as per IS 1367 (Part XII).
J 1.6	
Other Types of Bolts: There are other types of bolts, called twist-off bolts which 
have an additional stem at the end, which are tightened using double acting torque wrenches 
and the additional leg twists off when the desired torque is reached. The twist off occurs due 
to the torque applied and is not a direct indicator of the force in the bolt. For rusted bolts, the 
value of force in bolt may be appreciably less than that indicated by torque, hence these bolts 
are not preferred.
J.2	
Nut: Each bolt shall be tightened using a high strength nut, conforming to IS:6623. 
The nut has to be strong enough to be able to impart the necessary torque to the bolt and 
also withstand the force during the life of the structure. Further, the threads in nut shall be 
matching with the threads in the HSFG bolt and the nut shall be free running on the threads 
of the HSFG bolts.
J.2.1	
Property Class: Nuts are designated by property class designation, which is 
equal to 1/100 of the minimum tensile strength in Newton per square mm of the bolt. For 
HSFG bolts, the property classes to be used are 8, and 10 as specified in IS:1367 (Part 6), 
suitable for bolts of property Class 8.8 and 10.9 respectively. The nuts shall be hardened and 
then tempered at a temperature of at least 425ºC. Normal height of nut shall be more than 
0.8 times the nominal bolt diameter.
J.2.2	
Identification of Nut: The nuts have the following markings:
 
a) 
Manufacturer’s Identification Symbol.
 
b) 
Property class, marked as ‘8S’ or ‘10S’. (The suffix ‘S’ denotes a high strength 
structural nut with a large series hexagon.) Alternately, ‘8.8 S’ or ‘10.9 S’ are 
also acceptable.

======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
70
The marking shall be either on the top or the bottom face of double chamfered nuts and shall 
be either indented or embossed on non bearing surface of washer faced nuts.
J.2.3	
Surface of Nut: All nuts shall be supplied with coating consisting of zinc phosphate 
that is used in conjunction with suitable oil of rust preventive type as per IS:1367 (Part XII).
J.2.4	
Position of Nut in Bolt: HSFG bolt cannot be easily opened out except by use of 
torque wrench. Still, as an additional precaution, it may be ensured that the nut is not easily 
accessible for opening out by anti-social elements, the same shall be provided preferably as 
follows:
	
In Girder Web: Towards outside of the girder
	
In Flanges: Towards bottom (Except when in composite construction)
	
In Composite Construction: Towards inside of concrete
	
In Bracing: Towards the rolled section side so that the space for rotation of the nut 
is not readily available
	
Where tapered washer is used, the nut shall preferably be on the other side
J.3	
Holes for HSFG Bolts: Normal holes in the steel members being connected by 
the rivets shall be used for HSFG bolts also, subject to the following:
J.3.1	
Making of holes: The holes shall be made by drilling only.
J.3.2	
Nominal Diameter of Hole: The nominal diameter of hole shall be 2 mm more 
than the bolt diameter i.e. for 20 mm Ø HSFG bolt, the hole shall be 22 mm in diameter.
J.3.3	
Oversize Holes: In case the bolts are to be provided in existing structure, the 
maximum size of hole shall not 1.25 d or d + 4 mm whichever is less i.e. for 16 mm Ø bolt, 
the maximum diameter of hole shall not exceed 20 mm and for 24 mm Ø bolt, the maximum 
diameter shall not exceed 28 mm.
Use of Hardened Washers: In case the hole diameter exceeds the bolt diameter by 2 mm, 
hardened washer shall be used in place of normal washers.
J.4	
Washer: Annular rings which are provided between the bolt head/ nut and the 
members being joined are washers. Washers for HSFG bolts shall conform to IS 6649. The 
washers have the following characteristics:
	
Type A: Plain Hole Circular Washers
 
Type B: Square Taper Washers for use with Channels (6º Taper)
 
Type C: Square Taper Washers for use with I-Beams (8º Taper)
J.4.1	
Identification: Type A washers shall be identified by provision of two nibs (small 
projections) and manufacturer’s identification symbol in indented character. The Type B and 
C washers shall be identified by the type identification Symbol, B or C and the manufacturer’s 
identification symbol.

Fig, J-3  Typical markings/Shapes on Plain and Tapered Washers
J 4.2	
Washer : HSFG bolts shall be provided with minimum one washer. Normally, plain 
washer is provided. The washer(s) is (are) provided to prevent wear of the steel members 
being joined and coating there on during the tightening of bolt. If the bolt is longer than 
required, packing washers may be used. However, the maximum number of packing washers 
shall be limited to 3, with maximum total combined thickness of 12 mm. For over-size holes, 
hardened washers shall be used. These washers are required to prevent punching of the nut 
in the annular space around the bolt shank.
Note : IS:6649 specifies only one type of washers, which are through hardened and tempered.
Where the angle between the axis of bolt and the joint surface is more than 3 degree off 
normal, a tapered washer shall be used against the tapered surface. Non rotating surface 
shall preferably be placed against tapered washer. All washers (except DTIs) shall be 
supplied with coating consisting of zinc phosphate that is used in conjunction with suitable 
oil of rust preventive type as per IS:1367 (Part XII). All washers shall be flat with a maximum 
deviation not exceeding 0.25 mm from straight edge laid along a line passing through the 
center of the hole.
The Direct Tension Indicators (DTI) are special type of washers with indentations which get 
pressed when tension is applied. The pressing of indentations to required level indicates that 
the required tension has been applied in the bolts. Resemblance of DTIs with washers is 
incidental. In fact, these are precision engineered mechanical load cell which is the reliable 
method for checking HSFG bolt tensioning. As shown in figure below, DTIs have multiple 
projections, between which the feeler gauge is to be inserted to check if the bolt has been 
sufficiently tightened or not. Complete closing of the projections, however, may indicate either 
over tightening or poor quality material in DTI.
DTIs are very good method of ensuring that the bolts are tightened properly, and this method 
of tightening shall be preferred over the method with plain washers. The DTIs normally 
are patented products and shall be supplied preferably with zinc phosphate coating, but 
alternatively can be with any other corrosion prevention treatment given to the surface as 
specified by the manufacturer. These shall normally be provided below the head of the bolt 
(with projections towards bolt head) in case nut is rotated. In case the bolt is to be rotated, 
DTI shall be provided under nut (with projections towards nut) and in this case, an additional 
washer shall be provided on the DTI side to protect the protrusions from damage due to the 



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
72
abrasion during bolt tightening. Measuring the amount by which the indentations have been 
pressed indicate if the bolts have been tightened to the desired tension level.
The DTIs used shall be the ones which are compatible metallurgically and also suitable for 
the bolts of property Class 8.8 and 10.9. Suitable markings identifying the bolt manufacturer, 
property class of DTI and its diameter shall be engraved suitably on the DTI. Action of DTIs 
is as indicated below:
Fig. J-4  Direct Tension Indicator Washers
There are other proprietary tension indicators such as those having squirting action in which 
material squirts off and those having rubber projections which shear off when required tension 
load is applied. These tension indicators have not been considered in these guidelines.
Each bolt of property Class 8.8 shall have minimum one plain washer, which shall be provided 
in the part being rotated. Mostly the nut is rotated, but if space constraint is there, the reverse 
is true.
For Class 10.9 bolts, two washers shall be provided, one against head and one against the 
nut. The two washers are required in this case because of very high tension is imparted to 
the bolt, which can damage the steel members.
One DTI shall be used in one bolt. In case DTI is being provided, the same will count as 
one washer and in Class 10.9 bolts, one DTI and one plain washer shall be provided. In 
class 8.8 bolts only one DTI washer needs to be provided. If the nut is rotated, the DTI shall 
be provided under the head, and if the head is rotated, the DTI is to be provided under the 
nut. If DTI is used under the nut, washer faced nut as per IS:6623 shall be provided.
J.5	
Surface Preparation for Steel Interface before Providing HSFG Bolts
The steel interface between the plies which form a joint having HSFG bolts shall have special 
surface preparation so that sufficient slip factor is available. The following surface preparation 
shall be done.
The interface between the plies which are connected together by the HSFG bolts shall be 
“Aluminium metalized without any over coating”. The aluminium metalizing shall have a 
nominal thickness of 150 μm.
The interface of plies in old structures which are to be replaced by the HSFG bolts shall be 
cleaned by wire brushing/flame cleaning. The surfaces shall be cleaned to remove all loose

73
rust and paint layers (Only isolated patches of coatings/ rust can remain). If, however, in 
existing structures, rivets are to be replaced by bolts but no surface preparation is possible, 
the slip factor shall be suitably reduced.
J.6	
Installation of Bolts
The HSFG bolts work on the principle of applying a specified pre-load on the joint such that 
the plies in the joint are joined together without any gap. The tightening of HSFG bolts is to 
be done at stress level which is beyond the yield point, i.e. the plastic flow of material shall 
take place. This is important because the yield point of bolt material is well defined and after 
this level, the strain increases without increase in stress, as shown in Fig. J-5 below:
Fig. J-5  Tension - Elongation Screw
The bolt shall be tightened to minimum loads specified in IS:4000. For bolts subject to only 
tension, the force shall be as specified in Table 2 of IS:4000. For other joints, the same shall 
be as per Table 3 of IS:4000, reproduced below (Table J.2).

For M 22 bolts, which are non standard as per IS codes, the minimum bolt tension shall be 
182 KN for Class 8.8 and 251 KN for property Class 10.9.
The holes shall be brought in alignment by using drifts etc such, that the bolt threads are not 
damaged during insertion of bolts. Drifting shall not distort the metal or enlarge the holes. The 
members being joined shall be held in position by insertion of few HSFG bolts (tightened to 
first stage only). These bolts shall not be tightened to second stage till all the bolts in a joint 
are inserted and tightened to first stage (Fig. J-6).

Fig. J-6  Installation of HSFG Bolts
The bolts shall be inserted and tightened up to first stage of tightening. The drifts inserted as 
above shall also be removed one by one. The final tightening shall not proceed until the gap 
between the plates has been closed such that the residual gap, if any, is less than 2 mm at 
edges. There shall, however, be no gap in the central portion. In case the central portion is 
not in close contact or gap at edges is more than 2 mm, straightening of members may be 
done after opening out the bolts inserted and the entire procedure shall be repeated. During 
tightening of bolts also, the steel members can continue to deform and hence the tightening 
of subsequent bolts can lead to loosening of already tightened bolts. In order to minimize the 
loosening of already tight bolts, tightening in the two stages shall be done starting from the 
stiffest part to the free edges. Stiffest parts of joint are generally towards the center of the 
joint.
J.7	
Procedure for Installation of HSFG Bolts Using Direct Tension Indicator: This 
is the preferred method of installation of HSFG bolts.
Calibration of Direct Tension Indicator: Before the DTI are brought to site, the same shall be 
tested in the presence of Engineer. Three numbers of bolt of similar diameter and property 
class, as shall be used in the work, shall be taken and installed with DTI. The installation 
procedure to be followed shall be similar to the one given for plain washers. On full tightening, 
the projections on DTI washers shall meet the requirements of checks specified after second 
stage tightening using DTIs. Only the DTIs which satisfy the calibration shall be brought to 
site for work.
As a first stage, all bolts in the joint shall be tightened to ‘snug tight’ condition. Snug tight 
condition means the nut is tightened using an ordinary wrench by an average worker, applying 
maximum force on the wrench. This stage is required to bring the plies in close contact. After 
first stage of tightening, the joint shall be checked to see if the plies are in close contact and 
the clearances are not exceeded.
During the second stage of tightening, torque wrench is used to tighten the bolts until the 
indentations on the DTI indicate full tightening, feeler gauge of 0.40 mm thickness shall be 
used to check 100 percent of the bolts for proper tightening. The feeler gauge shall be used 



======================================================================

No more than 10 percent of the indicators in a connection bolts group shall exhibit full 
compression of the indicator. 
The procedure for checking the proper tightening of bolt using DTI is shown in the Fig. J-7 
below:
Fig. J-7  Method of Checking the Correct Tensioning Using DTI
The total number of indicators in a bolt connection shall be counted and it shall be ensured 
that not more than 10 percent exhibit full closure i.e. zero gap after tightening.
In the first stage, a calibrated wrench with an accuracy of ± 10 percent shall be set to 
75 percent of the torque computed for the complete tightening of the bolt. All the bolts in the 
joint shall be tightened to this torque. After checking all bolts after the first stage, permanent 
marks shall be made with suitable marker on the bolt as well as nut to indicate the relative 
position of the two. The mark shall be such that the same shall be visible for inspection upto 
1 year after the date of installation.
The steel members that make up the plies of the joint with HSFG bolts shall be checked for 
proper contact. 10 percent bolts shall be checked with a separate calibrated wrench set at 
75 percent of the proof load for the bolt and bolt turning by more than 15 degrees during the 
test, shall be reworked. If the loose bolts thus found are more than 5 but less than 1 percent 
of the total, another 10 percent of the bolts shall be checked. If the total loose bolts thus found 



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
76
exceed 1 percent of the total, the torque wrench shall be calibrated afresh and the entire lot 
shall be checked for tightness. The bolts shall be turned by a further amount as specified 
below (Table J.4).

After the second stage of tightening, 100 percent bolts shall be checked and certified to have 
been turned through the requisite amount by verifying the permanent marks on the nut and 
the bolt. 1 percent of the bolts, subject to minimum of 10 per size of bolts shall be checked 
for gross under-tightening as per procedure given in Annexure-D of IS:4000.
J.8	
Retensioning of Bolts
The HSFG bolts are tightened beyond yield stress level and undergo plastic deformation once 
tightened fully. If the bolt is opened out after complete tightening, its length gets increased 
permanently as compared with the initial length. The initial few threads which transfer the load 
from the nut to the bolt suffer the maximum damage. Therefore, a bolt completely tightened 
shall not be re-used under any circumstances.
The bolt tensioned completely can be identified by damage to the threads especially near 
the front end of nut where most of the load is transferred. The coating, if any, may also show 
signs of damage. The free running of the nut on the threads may also be affected. A fully 
tensioned bolt, opened out for any reason whatsoever, needs to be rejected and removed 
from the site of work. Along with the bolt, the nut, washer(s) and DTI(s) used on that bolt also 
need to be rejected and removed from the site of work. A bolt which has been snug tightened 
or partially tightened and then opened out will not be considered to have been re-tensioned 
and reuse of such bolts will be permissible in the same or different holes, as required.
Except for works of minor nature where number of HSFG bolts to be installed is very less, 
only mechanical torque wrenches (pneumatic, hydraulic, electronic etc.) shall be used for 
tightening of bolts. For small quantum of work, manual torque wrenches may be used. 
Calibrated torque wrenches, accompanied with a certificate to the effect, shall be brought 
to site. Torque wrenches shall be calibrated periodically, once in a year, to an accuracy of 
± 10 percent. These shall be re-calibrated in case of any incidence involving the wrench during 
use resulting in heavy impact (such as fall, mishandling etc.). The procedure for calibration 
of torque wrench shall be as specified by the manufacturer.
There are other methods of tensioning, but only the two methods outlined above have been 
found to be suitable as per the field conditions.

APPENDIX - K
Utilization of Crane and Safety
(Refer Clause 2.1.3)
The following knowledge of cranes will be of help in Fabrication and Erection of Steel 
Bridges:
K.1	
Basic Types and Configuration
Within broad category of mobile cranes there have evolved the following basic types and 
configurations:
Lorry Loaders
Industrial Yard Cranes
Truck Mounted Lattice Boom Crane
Crawler Mounted Lattice Boom Crane
Truck Mounted Telescopic Boom Crane
Rough Terrain Cranes
Mobile Tower Cranes
Heavy Lift Mobile cranes
K.2	
Basic Operational Characteristics
There are many types of design to satisfy both the general needs of construction and industrial 
operations. However the basic operational characteristics of all mobile cranes are essentially 
the same.
They include
Adjustable boom length
Adjustable boom angle
Ability to lift and lower loads
Ability to slew loads
Ability to travel about the job site under their own power
K.3	
Principles of Operation
The crane manual should be strictly followed and referred for Load vs operating radius chart 
and Do’s & Dont’s for Safe operation of the crane.
There are four quadrants of operation. The forward quadrant of 90º degrees is made up of 
45º spread on either side of the centre line of the crane in the forward direction. Similarly 
the backward quadrant on the backward direction. The remaining two quadrants will be side 
quadrants. As far as the stability is concerned, the safety of the crane is comparatively more 



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 89
======================================================================
IRC:SP:104-2015
78
while the boom is operating in the forward quadrant i.e. over the front compared to those 
operating in other quadrants like over the back or over the side.
The pressure acting on the ground below the crane due to the reaction from the crane is 
never uniform. Generally, it is tapered and increasing towards the tipping point. Before lifting 
is started the ground is to be judged for its capacity to provide the required reaction. Most of 
the time the ground is reinforced with wooden sleepers, steel sections etc. The force from the 
outrigger pads are to be passed to the ground through appropriately arranged grillage.
Special care should be taken while operating the crane on freshly filled and or not properly 
compacted soil. Also care must be taken while working on embankment particularly near the 
slopes as machine weight and vibrations can cause them to collapse. Stability failures are 
foreseeable.
Structural failure often occurs before stability failure If load is added beyond its rated capacity 
the crane fails structurally before there is any sign of tipping. Structural failure includes all 
permanent damages such as over-stressing, bending and twisting of any of the components of 
the crane . When the crane is over-stressed the damage is not usually apparent. Nevertheless 
a structural failure might have occurred. The over-stressed component is liable to have a 
catastrophic failure at some future time. So care should be taken to avoid the over-loading 
of the crane.
K.4	
Assembly, Disassembly and Transportation of Crane and it’s Components
While transporting the crane, care should be taken to arrest the movement of the swinging 
parts. Attaching slings to the main chord should be avioded and the fittings at the ends of 
the main chords should be used. Synthetic web slings should be used preferably and, if wire 
ropes are used, the boom sections should be padded well to prevent damage. The boom 
sections should be suitably blocked while loading on to trucks. Chain binders should be 
avoided, as they may damage or bend the boom.
For assembly of booms, the manufacturer’s procedure and the instructions should be 
followed, assembly of the crane should be done on a level area and should be done in such 
a way that the boom is in the quadrant of maximum stability. All outrigger beams should be 
fully extend laterally and outrigger’s lifting cylinders should lift the wheels off the ground and 
level the carrier.
The amount of counter-weight required should be checked from the crane manual for the 
maximum value of the load that will be lifted and the length of boom that will be installed. 
The swing lock should be set when the assembly is being done. No attempt should be made 
to raise the boom, while assembly, until all boom insert connection pins (splicing bolts) are 
installed. Wind velocity should be checked before lifting the boom off the ground.
K.5	
Signaling
The signal men must be used when the operator is not in a position to see the load and 
its movement. Hand signals can be used when the distance between the operator and the

signalman is not more and conditions allow for clear visibility. Standard hand signaling should 
be adopted. It is always preferable to use walkie-talkie.
K.6	
Multiple Crane Lifts
A multiple crane lift should be meticulously planned and every eventuality taken into 
consideration. Lift must be planned and carried out under qualified supervisors. For a multiple 
crane lift, no crane should be loaded to 75 percent of its net capacity. The lift, swing and 
boom speeds of both the cranes should be matched. Wherever possible the cranes should 
not travel with load. Sufficient communication should be ensured (preferably by walkie-talkie) 
amongst the Supervisor and Crane Operators. Supervisor should be positioned to view the 
total operation and be able to communicate with both the operators. The movement of the 
load should be jerk free and smooth. Use of equalizer beam is preferable.
K.7	
Working Near a Electric Line
If power line exists in the erection area, the electric department should be intimated in advance 
regarding the time and place of crane use. The limit of operating distance should be above 
6 m from 33 KVA live line. Dry polypropylene ropes should be used for tag line. All safety 
precautions shall be ensured to avoid electrocution.
K.8	
Load Charts
Load chart of the crane shall be referred to for assessing the lifting capacity of the crane at 
the required radius and height of erection. Engineers should adjust the lifting capacity of the 
crane basing on the machine condition, crane type ,wind speeds and other site conditions.
K.9	
Wire Ropes
All wire ropes should be thoroughly inspected before use and inspection of all ropes must be 
made at regular intervals. A rope which has not been used for a long period should be given 
a thorough inspection before it is put back into service, after proper lubrication. Wire ropes 
shall be inspected for kinks, wear, fatigue, abrasion and corrosion.
Ropes, having six or more randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay, three or more 
broken wires in one strand in one rope lay or having more than one broken wire near an 
attached fitting should not be used.
In running ropes if there is any evidence of wire breaks in the valleys between strands in one 
rope lay or having wear exceeding 1/3 of the diameter of the individual wires should not be 
used.
All ropes having signs of severe stretch, having noticeable corrosion in the vicinity of fittings, 
having Crushed, Flattened or Jammed Strands should be replaced. The replacement of rope 
for all the above conditions should be made to correct specification.
