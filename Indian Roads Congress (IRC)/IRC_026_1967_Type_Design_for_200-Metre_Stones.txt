2.  Materials
200-Metre Stones shall be of locally available hard Stone, 
well-dressed or of reinforced cement concrete.
3.  Location  and  Fixing
200-Metre Stones are to be located on the same side of the 
road as the one having the Kilometre Stones. The stones 
may be fixed in position with rammed spalls in moorum, 
lime-surkhi concrete of lean cement concrete all round. 
They should be planted securely just beyond the edge of 
the formation with their side bearing the inscription facing 
and parallel to the centre line of the road. The manner of 
locating the stones when the road may be in embankment 
or cutting is illustrated in Fig. 2.
4.  Inscription
The inscription carried by the stones shall be the numerals 
2, 4, 6 and 8 marked in an ascending order in the direction 
of increasing kilometrage away from the starting station. 
The numerals shall be 80 mm high and shall conform to the 
type as shown in the Plate. These may be either painted or, 
preferably, engraved. The colour of the numerals shall be 
black on a white background on all categories of roads.
Note:	 Existing Furlong Stones may be converted to 200-Metre 
Stones where economical.
