GUIDELINES ON REPAIR, STRENGTHENING &  
REHABILITATION OF CONCRETE BRIDGES
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1	
Weakness signs and rapid deterioration of old bridge structures has become a serious 
problem in our country. The issue of maintaining the bridges has, therefore, become one of the 
most important challenges. Bridge engineers need a reliable way to assess structural integrity 
of bridges to maintain the continuous operation of the road network while ensuring the safety 
of the public. Strengthening and rehabilitation need expert knowledge and specialization. In 
order to guide bridge professionals, IRC first brought out IRC:SP:40 “Guidelines for Techniques 
for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges” in the year 1990. These guidelines covered 
common procedure for assessment of distress in bridges, selection of techniques and materials 
as also approach to remedial measures and formulation of suitable repair plans and document 
was widely adopted by professionals.
Since then lot of advancement have taken place in testing methodology, testing equipment, 
repair and strengthening techniques and materials and a need was felt to revise the document 
to keep pace with the latest advancement and international best practice. The task of revision 
of IRC:SP:40 was assigned to Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation Committee (B-8) during 
the tenure 2015-17. The initial draft was prepared by the Sub-group of B-8 Committee under 
Chairmanship of Shri P.Y. Manjure, comprising Dr. D.K. Kanhere, Shri R.K. Jaigopal and Dr. 
Harshavardhan Subbarao as members. After re-constitution of B-8 Committee in 2018, the 
earlier subgroup was requested to carry out further work of revision and induct new Members 
Dr. Samir Surlaker and Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure.
The document prepared by the Sub-group was deliberated in number of meetings by B-8 
Committee and finally approved in its meeting held on 28th September, 2018 for placing before 
the Bridges, Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS) Commi ttee. The Condition 
Assessment Criteria has been introduced in this revision and all the results of visual inspection 
and detailed investigations are to be categorized into five condition states namely Excellent, 
Good, Fair, Poor and Critical.
The personnel of the Management, Maintenance and Rehabilitation Committee (B-8) for the 
tenure 2018-20 is as given below:

The Bridges, Specifications and Standard Committee approved this document in its meetings held 
at IRC headquarters on 24th October, 2018. Subsequently, the Executive Committee approved 
the document on 27th October, 2018 for placing it before the IRC Council. Thereafter guidelines 
were approved by the IRC Council in its 216th meeting held during 79th Annual Session at Nagpur 
on 22nd November, 2018 for publishing.
1.2	
The deterioration of bridges is a world-wide phenomenon and the causes for this are 
also well known. The bridge condition and its performance may be affected due to inadequate 
design, poor quality construction, overloading, congestion of traffic on the bridge, inadequate 
maintenance, atmospheric effects, lack of knowledge about long term behavior, traffic, capacity 
augmentation, unforeseen events like abnormal floods, earthquake etc. The consequences 
faced are premature bridge deterioration, loss of traffic safety or reduction of structural strength 
necessitating imposition of load limitations and in some cases needing replacement resulting 
in heavy economic as also financial loss. These could be avoided if focused attention is given 
to conservation of existing bridges through regular monitoring and timely repairs on the basis 
of systematic investigation and adequate funds are devoted by Bridge Authorities on a regular 
basis based on assessed requirement for this purpose.
1.3	
Scope: The scope of these guidelines is as under:
	
(i)	
Defining general process and approach for assessment of distresses, diagnosis 
of causes, proposing remedial measures and the corresponding methods 
and techniques for the engineering operations for different types of bridges 
constructed in the country.

(ii)	
Appraisal methods and conservation techniques for different types of bridge.
	
(iii)	 General guidelines on selection of techniques and materials.
	
(iv)	 Widening of existing bridges.
1.4 
Definitions: Since the publication of earlier guidelines, there has been an evolution 
of many terms in respect of repair & rehabilitation all over the world. Many terms resemble one-
another but are not identical. In order to have clarity, various terms are broadly defined in this 
guideline and are given below:
	
i.	
Assessment: Analysis with the aim to ascertain the condition and the capacity 
of an existing structure.
	
ii.	
Damage: Usually related to defects caused by external actions such as 
accidents, may also result from faulty design or workmanship. Frequently, used 
for defects resulting from deterioration processes.
	
iii.	
Degradation: Usually associated with wear and tear with age, also used to 
denote reduction in quality or strength.
	
iv.	
Defect: Slightly worse, more categorical and specific than deficiency.
	
v.	
Deficiency: Anything which found to be lacking or affecting the condition.
	
vi.	
Demolition: The process of dismantling and removal of existing structure, 
normally with the aim of total/partial renewal or replacement. May also be used 
in connection with repair work, e.g. demolition of deteriorated concrete.
	
vii.	
Destruction: Total damage to a structure caused by a deliberate action or by 
accidental or exceptional loads including earthquake.
	
viii.	 Deterioration: Reduction in condition and function of structure caused by 
“natural” causes like climate, environment.
	
ix.	
Disintegration: Severe deterioration resulting in breakup of components.
	
x.	
Evaluation: Often used as a synonym for assessment, but assessment is 
closely related with damaged and deteriorated structures.
	
xi.	
Inspection: Activity to ascertain the actual condition of the structure, including 
laboratory tests; but less exhaustive than investigation.
	
xii.	
Investigation: More in-depth and detailed than inspections, also includes 
analytical studies of strength and traffic, etc.
	
xiii.	 Maintenance: Activity meant either to prevent or rectify the effects of deterioration. 
May partly or wholly restore a specific component back to the original condition 
anticipated in the design. Maintenance is usually done periodically.
	
	
It comprises any activity and work including inspection necessary to enable a 
structure to continue to fulfill the intended function or to sustain its original or 
required form and appearance. It excludes any work leading to improvement 
of the structure whether by strengthening widening or by vertical realignment 
of the road surface, repairs of any damage caused by exceptional causes like 
landslides, earthquakes, cyclones, fire, etc. The maintenance operation starts 
with the opening of the bridge to traffic. 
	
xiv.	 Penetration: Ingress of water inside the components.

xv.	
Rebuild: See Replacement.
	
xvi.	 Reconstruction: See Replacement.
	
xvii.	 Rehabilitation: Bringing the structure back to its original level of function 
including strength and durability. 
	
xviii.	Remodeling: Includes changes in function and performance of the structure 
due to change in usage or occupancy.
	
xix.	 Removal: Removing components from the structure.
	
xx.	
Renewal: Almost the same as replacement, but may include new materials/
techniques.
	
xxi.	 Repairs: Repair work is intended to prevent further damages to the members 
and restore functional performance. More routine and frequent activity than 
rehabilitation. Often repair includes a part of the structure do not imply bringing 
back the structure to its original level of durability and strength.
	
	
Repair activities shall generally cover minor damages to the components of 
the bridge. Such damages could be surface protection, hollows, honeycombs, 
cavities, loss of section, spalling, de-lamination and cracking of concrete etc. In 
steel bridges, it could be corrosion, breaking or rupturing etc. These activities 
would be similar to maintenance activities but on a larger scale. In short, repair 
activities shall consist of remedial action which would broadly include concrete 
restoration, cathodic control & protection, preserving or restoring passivity.
	
xxii.	 Replacement: “Worn out components” are replaced by new ones. May include 
improvements and strengthening, but does usually not include change in 
function.
	
xxiii.	Restoration: Bring the structure back to the original condition not only with 
regard to function, but also to aesthetic or performance etc.
	
xxiv.	 Retrofitting: Particularly used in connection with either repair and rehabilitation 
related to earthquake damaged structures or as a means of preventing damage 
to structures situated in earthquake zone and also structurally deficient bridge 
elements. Includes not only rehabilitation but also strengthening and remodeling, 
i.e. structural intervention.
	
	
Retrofitting is improvement intended to restore a specific structural function or 
enhancement of bridge status to a higher performance level or modification of 
the structure to make it fit for additional load capacity. Retrofitting procedures 
include the addition of supplemental spanning designed to reduce seismic 
damage.
	
xxv.	 Strengthening: Increasing the strength of the structure by various means such 
as plate bonding, jacketing, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) bonding, 
external pre-stressing, etc. It shall implyre-instating the designed strength/load 
bearing capacity of the structure as intended in the original design.
	
xxvi.	Survey: Inspection of a large area or a large number of structures/components 
in order of get objective information.

CHAPTER 2
BASIC APPROACH
2.1	
Introduction
The bridges must have a specified level of strength, safety and serviceability during their life under 
the anticipated traffic and environmental conditions. The process and approach methodology for 
assessment and remedial measures are elaborated in this chapter. The objective is to:
	
•	
Establish desired levels of maintenance service.
	
•	
Form the basis for cost analysis of maintenance program.
	
•	
Use men, material and money efficiently in an optimal manner.
	
•	
Establish Methodology to assess performance both with and without corrective 
action.
	
•	
Improve existing facilities wherever economically practicable through 
maintenance.
2.2 
Factors Influencing Repair / Rehabilitation / Strengthening Strategy
While deciding the approach to the problem of distressed bridges, various factors are required 
to be investigated. Bridges are vital link on the highways and road network and are susceptible 
to deterioration. Needs of society for road network and consequently the usage of bridges do 
change continuously. These give rise to the need for repairs, retrofitting, rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of existing bridges. Besides, it necessitates establishing the requirements, needs 
and changes the present and future bridge stock may impose on the Bridge Authority. In this 
regard the following factors are necessary to be considered:
	
i.	
Traffic demands
	
ii.	
Environmental constraints
	
iii.	
Technical restrictions
	
iv.	
Social-Economic factors
	
v.	
Geographical conditions
	
vi.	
Strategic importance
2.2.1	
Traffic demands
The traffic volumes and gross weight of vehicles have been observed to grow continuously. The 
axle loads have also had a strong upward trend during the recent decades. The tendency is to 
carry as much load as possible on a single vehicle in order to reduce the transportation cost. 
The reason for increasing axle loads is thus an economic. Authorities many a times, increases 
the legal axle load limits which needs to be considered for strengthening of a bridge. Another 
important factor to be considered in traffic loads is the size of exceptionally heavy vehicles which 
may cross the bridge. The growth in traffic volumes and axle weights have thus to be considered 
for determining the type of strengthening measures to be adopted.
2.2.2	
Environmental constraints
As the awareness about environmental degradation increases in the public mind, there will 
be more demands from them for protection against environmental damages. After the traffic, 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
6
environmental factors are accountable for the deterioration of bridges. Extreme climatic 
conditions such as, abnormal variations in wind speed, water flow & temperature and vicinity 
of foul gases, harmful chemicals etc. aggravate the deterioration mechanisms. The selection 
of treatment depends on the type and severity of the environment. The residual service life of 
existing concrete structures is largely determined by its deterioration over time. The deterioration 
rate of concrete structures depends not only on the construction processes employed and the 
composition of the materials used in the construction process, but also on the current as well as 
past environment. Meanwhile, global warming and climate change may alter this environment in 
the future, especially in the long term, causing more acceleration of deterioration processes and 
consequently affecting the safety and serviceability of existing concrete infrastructure.
2.2.3	
Technical restrictions
The more complex the structure of bridges, the more difficult it is to strengthen or rehabilitate 
them. The higher cost related to repair and rehabilitation of such structures can sometimes 
make replacement more economical. The understanding of type of the bridge structure and its 
structural configuration is paramount in deciding the type of repair option to be implemented.
2.2.4	
Socio-economic factors
The bridges of regions of developed or developing socio-economic activities and public demands 
shall be given priority over the other areas. Past experience shows that damage to bridge 
components can severely disrupt traffic flow and thus negatively impacting on the economy of 
the affected region. The extent of these impacts will depend not only on the nature and magnitude 
of distress on the bridge, but also on the mode of functional impairment of the highway system 
as a network resulting from physical damage of its components.
2.2.5	
Geographical conditions
Many a times these conditions will influence the nature of rehabilitation that needs to be carried 
out. Treatment to be given to the bridges located in hills and landslide prone areas would differ 
from the measures adopted for bridges in coastal areas or bridges located in plains.
2.2.6	
Strategic importance
Some bridges are strategically located such as those at sensitive areas near country’s borders, 
those located in areas which are vulnerable to cyclones and storms etc. Remedial measures will 
therefore need to take into consideration the location and sensitivity of bridges.
The increased importance of strengthening and rehabilitation of bridges can be characterized by:
	
-	
Increased loads and traffic
	
-	
Increased technical challenges in areas not yet fully envisaged,
	
-	
Increased costs due to (i) limitations of the possibilities for replacement 
(ii)  technical and practical difficulties in carrying out rehabilitation and 
(iii) diversion or absence of alternate route.
	
-	
Increased maintenance owing to the high cost of rehabilitation of the bridge.
2.3	
Decision Making Approach
2.3.1	
Decision making approach for maintenance and repairs shall be preventive rather 
than reactive. The safety and serviceability of both the users and the bridge shall be the 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
7
prime objective and shall be the basis of decision. Bridge condition, deterioration rate, future 
developmental planning considerations, and remaining life of bridge shall influence policy 
decision. Fund availability and estimated costs of maintenance & repairs including for diversion, 
if any, shall also be kept under consideration.
The individual decision considerations will vary in accordance with the size and importance 
of bridge. For rehabilitation/strengthening of major bridges, elaborate analytical techniques for 
evaluation of various solutions, cost as well as performance effectiveness of alternate measures/
solutions including optimization shall be done. The life cycle cost, risk minimization, safety 
maximization etc. could be the factors of optimization. Rehabilitation and strengthening work of 
minor bridges may be carried out in accordance with inter-se priority and availability of funds. 
In all cases, however, it should be ensured that available funds are earmarked and allocated in 
accordance with the Authority’s overall objectives and policies. The general policy must take into 
account the number of parameters already described in Para 2.2 above.
In principle, the decision ranging from no action, partial/complete immediate and/or differed 
maintenance, repairs, rehabilitation, strengthening to replacement of bridge could be reached 
through a cost-benefit, NPV, LCC and similar optimization analysis. All the activities of bridge 
maintenance and repairs shall be institutionalized.
2.3.2	
The bridges may be divided into non-structural elements with relatively short-life 
spans such as wearing courses, water proofing, expansion joints, paint, railings, signage, 
drains, appurtenances etc. and structural elements with long-life spans such as bridge 
decks, abutments, column/piers, foundations etc. Such division between short-life and long-
life bridge elements is necessary because of the stronger economic motivation to rehabilitate 
and strengthen long life elements than short life elements. A division between culverts, minor 
bridges, major or important/state of the art bridges is also warranted. A consideration of alternate 
materials and techniques available, their suitability and economy are very crucial while making a 
decision. Traffic considerations and a division between bridges on type of roads i.e. rural roads, 
state highways, national highways and expressways is also necessary. The general policy for 
rehabilitation/strengthening of bridges must therefore be based on the following factors:
Bridge Geometry: Length, Carriage Way Width, Waterway, Clearances; Environment, 
Load Carrying Capacity, Seismic vulnerability, Urgency of Maintenance Emergency, Future 
Demand, Strategic Importance, Location, Category of Road, Traffic Volume, Bridge Condition, 
Administrative & Political Considerations, Life of Elements.
As far as possible, the decision should be based on quantitative analysis.
2.4 
Technical Approach for Rehabilitation/Strengthening
The best strategies can only be determined in the light of assessment of the present condition of 
the bridge through detailed investigation and analysis of the deterioration mechanism. Wherever 
possible, the root cause(s) of the deterioration should be evaluated and eliminated. Repair and 
strengthening operations should be mechanically and chemically compatible with the properties 
of the original or surrounding material and the basic structural concept. The various steps 
involved in working out a plan for rehabilitation/strengthening could be as below:
	
(a)	
Evaluation of the Structure from Past Records, Documented Data Base 
and Inspection
	
	
These have been given in IRC: SP-35.

(b)	
Distress Types, Location etc.
	
	
The deterioration of a structure can often be found visually through visible signs 
of damages. However, there may be hidden distresses which may surface after 
considerable period of time. Therefore visual inspection by an experienced 
engineer is a vital step in the chain of further follow-up action. A routine or 
principal inspection provides a detailed description of some of the damages 
where an assessment of the structure may become necessary.
	
	
The use of various testing methods may often become necessary to ascertain 
the observations of the visual inspection of the structure. Testing techniques and 
equipment should be capable to determine the extent and type of deterioration 
or damage and consequences of failure to the importance of structure. To the 
extent possible, non-destructive tests should be used. If necessary, the results of 
these testes may be supplemented and/or calibrated by sampling procedures in 
accordance with the small step principle, that is when deficiencies are discovered 
from a minimum number of specimens (a small sampling ) the investigation may 
require a more detailed analysis. These procedures are standardized.
	
(c) 
Analysis of Causes of Damages/Defects and Distresses
	
	
The purpose of evaluation of a distressed structure is not only to determine 
the effect of damage on the structure’s life expectancy/load carrying capacity, 
but also, and perhaps more importantly, determinate, to the possible extent, its 
cause so as to intelligently determine an effective retrofit. Before repair plan is 
implemented, the cause of the damage has to be removed or the repair measures 
have to be designed to accommodate the cause and protection against it in 
future. Otherwise the risk of repetition of damage will continue to exist.
	
(d)	
Evaluation of Results of Structural Assessment
	
	
Data resulting from the investigation of a damaged structure including monitoring 
of its distress form the basis for the decision as to what corrective action must 
be undertaken. This depends on type, extent and severity of the damage. 
The bridges may be affected by a combination of two or more deterioration 
mechanisms, which is complex to analyse and needs to be dealt with care.
	
	
The initial concern should be to find out whether or not there is a risk of failure to 
the damaged structure. If this risk is present, the first course of action must be to 
immediately provide an adequate auxiliary support mechanism and to reduce the 
loads to remove the risk. Where minor damage exists it should be investigated 
whether the damage is stable or will propagate with subsequent service loading. 
This is often a difficult and subjective assessment, made on the basis of visual 
examination until it can be verified with additional data and detailed calculations. 
The elements of time and/or the harshness of the environment becomes an 
important parameters when either the load carrying capacity is being diminished 
by deterioration (corrosion etc.) or when the load carrying capacity has to be 
increased due to increased traffic load or increase in legal axle load limits. Some 
evaluations will relate to whether or not an economically effective repair plan 
can limit or contain and thus can enhance the effective life of the structure. In 
some instances, an evaluation will be concerned with the degree of urgency 
required to implement a repair plan because of the advanced stage of damage.



======================================================================

The urgency of repairs, strengthening or replacement must be evaluated in a 
technical sense along with realistic cost estimates so that proper priorities can 
be established in budget planning. The question of urgency must also consider 
an estimation of remaining life expectancy. Although assumptions in a time 
dependent damage process are at best subjective, their evaluation will make an 
assessment of the degree of urgency less complex. Approximate estimations 
of life expectancy are valuable where damage is related to time dependent 
deterioration, e.g. corrosion of reinforcement. However, because of inherent 
uncertainties, the estimate will have to be presented in terms of upper and lower 
probability limits.
	
	
In some cases, it may be necessary to evaluate the lord carrying capacity of the 
bridge. Guidelines for this evaluation have been issued separately (IRC:SP:37). 
De-rating and/or regulated traffic options need also to be examined in these cases.
	
(e) 
Design of Repairs for Rehabilitation/Strengthening Works
	
	
The most important step in the design of repairs for rehabilitation and/or 
strengthening work is a careful assessment of the existing structure. The purpose 
of this assessment is to identify all defects and damages, diagnose their causes 
and to evaluate the present and likely future adequacy of the structure.
	
	
Generally the structural design for repairs shall conform to the relevant IRC 
guidelines. However, it must be recognized that the repairs for rehabilitation/ 
strengthening is a special type of work and many a time accurate structural 
analysis may not be possible for the assessment of the existing strength as 
well as for the repairs for rehabilitation /strengthening. At the same, the design 
in some cases may have to account for effects of secondary stress and 
composite actions. When the structural system is complex for accurate analysis, 
specification more conservative than IRC specification may have to be adopted. 
On the other hand, in certain special cases construction difficulties and thus 
calculated risk may have to be considered. The designer of the rehabilitation/ 
strengthening measures has, therefore, to be very judicious in his approach.
	
(f)	
Proposals and Estimation of Costs
	
	
The complexity and magnitude of the repair work will depend on whether
	
-	
Only the cause of damage has to be rectified or
	
-	
The structure must be restored to original condition or
	
-	
The structure needs to be upgraded for its load carrying capacity and/or for 
its geometry.
The degree of restoration will depend on whether or not the bridge is required to be restored 
to the original or greater load carrying capacity. If for technical and/or economic reasons, it is 
not feasible to achieve a complete restoration to original capacity and at the same time total 
replacement is not an acceptable option, a reduction of the applied live load becomes mandatory. 
(Ref.IRC:SP:37)
The Bridge Authority in reaching a decision as to the course of action will have to evaluate 
not only the technically feasible options available, but also the costs of each option, time of 
execution, political considerations (economic impact on communities served by the facility), life 
expectancy associated with various options available, any historical significance of the structure,

any risks that may be involved with any changes in safety level or reduction in load carrying 
capacity etc. The rehabilitation and/or strengthening of major bridges is a complex task requiring 
many a time input from several specialists. The bridge engineer, therefore, has to consult the 
experts in different fields to work out the appropriate repair plan.
2.5	
Technical Pre-Requisites for Intervention
2.5.1	
Main objective of this activity is to introduce and present procedures for assessment 
of bridge structures with a view to arrive at proper remedial scheme for their maintenance, repair 
and rehabilitation. The assessment is a complex interaction between structural condition from 
visual inspection and construction records, information from in-situ and laboratory investigation 
and possible potential remedial actions. Such data can be gathered from investigation of the 
causes of distress and mechanism of deterioration.
Assessment of existing bridge structure shall generally comprise the following activities:
	
•	
Collecting historical information about performance and maintenance.
	
•	
Routine inspection usually visual followed by basic testing.
	
•	
Condition evaluation and planning detailed investigation if necessary.
	
•	
Detailed investigation and special testing of materials.
	
•	
Examination of deterioration phenomenon for assessment of durability, strength, 
safety and serviceability.
	
•	
For reinforcement and pre-stressing steel, checking the extent and severity of 
corrosion and residual pre-stressing forces.
2.5.2	
Various steps involved in working out a plan for maintenance, repair and rehabilitation 
could be as described below:
	
(a)	
Preparation
	
	
Proper preparation and planning are basic requirements to be met in order to 
carry out professional assessment of distressed bridge. The objectives and 
concerns of the bridge authority shall be taken into consideration. An overview 
shall be established with typical reasons of deterioration or structural conditions. 
It shall also include program for various tests.
	
(b)	
Inspections
	
	
The visual inspection is the fundamental basis for providing a life time monitoring 
and understanding of the structure, site conditions and deterioration. The 
inspection should provide detail description of the type & location of damages 
where assessment of the structure is necessary. From the results of the 
visual inspection and basic testing Main mechanism of deterioration has to be 
established. Planning of the detailed investigation can be done if necessary on 
the basis of inspection.
	
(c)	
Investigations
	
	
The objective is to establish causes of deterioration, their degree and 
consequences on the present as well as future structural strength, safety, 
durability & serviceability. Use of various testing methods may become 
necessary to complement the results of visual inspection. Testing techniques 
and equipment shall be arrived at, depending upon the importance of the 



======================================================================


IRC:SP:40-2019
11
structure; location, type, extent, and severity of defects. In case of corrosion, 
tests to establish concrete and steel properties considering mechanical and 
durability aspects shall be carried out. Rate and quantum of corrosion shall be 
established. Besides, assessment of the global response of the structure on 
account of corrosion shall be done.
	
(d)	
Analysis of Cause of Distress
	
	
Information collected during inspection and investigation data of the bridge 
structure shall be analyzed to establish deterioration mechanism thereby the 
cause of damage, its effect on life expectancy and load carrying capacity. 
This would help in arriving at possible maintenance, repair and rehabilitation 
measures. An appropriate protection against the defect cause has to be provided 
to avoid repetition.
2.5.3	
Analysis done as referred earlier provides understanding of the causes and degree 
of deterioration. It is then possible to take review of the design aspects and an assessment can 
be proposed. The review can cover aspects such as evolution of the current service conditions, 
remaining load carrying capacity and deterioration progress etc.
An initial concern shall be whether there is any risk of failure of the damaged structure. If it is 
there, the first action shall be to provide adequate support mechanism and to reduce loads. 
When there is minor damage, it shall be assessed whether it would aggravate due to service 
loads. The recalculation exercise (design review) can throw light on this aspect.
The evaluation shall bring out efficacy of repair plain in as much as it can contain damage 
and enhance life to the bridge. In some instances, an evaluation will be concerned with the 
degree of urgency required to carry out repairs due to advanced stage of damage. On the basis 
of measures evaluated for rehabilitation, cost of it shall be estimated and incorporated in the 
budgeting. In case of time dependent damage, estimation of life expectancy is important.
2.5.4	
Generally the structural design for repairs shall conform to the relevant IRC codes. 
However, it must be recognized that the repairs for rehabilitation a special type of work and many 
a time accurate structural analysis may not be possible both for assessment of existing strength 
as well as for rehabilitation. At the same time, the design in some cases may have to account for 
effects of secondary stress and composite actions. Sometimes specification more conservative 
than the IRC may have to be adopted when structural system is more complex. In certain 
cases calculated risk will have to be taken by permitting higher stresses due to constructional 
difficulties. The measures finally to be adopted would be governed by needs, access, traffic 
closure atmospheric conditions, funds etc.
2.5.5	
The scheme of maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of a bridge would depend upon 
the following factors:
	
•	
Removal of the cause of the damage.
	
•	
Requirements of rehabilitation of structure to the original condition.
	
•	
Requirements of up-gradation of structure to increase load carrying capacity.
There are alternate options to be considered in evaluation and restoration of the damaged 
structure. Therefore opinion of an expert bridge engineer in different related fields is must to 
work out the appropriate repair plan/intervention scheme.

CHAPTER 3
TYPES OF BRIDGES AND DISTRESSES NORMALLY OBSERVED
3.1	
Introduction
The distresses normally observed in different types of road bridges are discussed in this 
chapter. The type of distress is related to the material used in design and construction of various 
components.
3.2	
Types of Bridges
Various types of road bridges in India are broadly classified on the basis of materials used and 
their structural form as under:
3.2.1	
Type of Material:
	
i	
Masonry: Stone, Brick and Cement Concrete Block

13
	
iii	
Movement of the abutment or supporting pier: This is normally followed by the 
arch ring deformation, hog or a sag.
	
iv	
Longitudinal cracks: These could be due to varying subsidence along the length 
of the abutment or pier.
	
v	
Lateral and diagonal cracks indicate a dangerous state.
	
vi	
Cracks between the arch ring, spandrel or parapet wall.
	
vii	
Old cracks no longer widening and these probably occurred immediately after 
the bridge was built.
	
viii	
A vertical crack in the return wall: This is generally seen at locations where 
foundations on yielding soil are stepped.
	
ix	
Bulging of wall: This could be due to absence or malfunctioning of weep holes.
3.3.2	
Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC)
The most common distresses in R.C.C. bridges are as follows :
(a)	
Cracking
Cracks could be of Structural and/or Non-Structural in nature. The significance of cracks depends 
on type of the crack, length, width & depth, location, nature (orientation), type of the structure 
and whether the width and length increase with time and load. These cracks can be due to 
several reasons like:
	
i	
Plastic shrinkage and plastic settlement
	
ii	
Drying shrinkage
	
iii	
Early thermal movement cracks
	
iv	
Reactive aggregates
	
v	
Corrosion of reinforcement
	
vi	
Sulphate attack & Delayed Ettringite Formation (DEF)
	
vii	
Physical salt weathering
	
viii	
Frost damage
	
ix	
Uneven settlement
	
x	
Structural deficiency
	
xi	
Inadequate drainage
	
xii	
Vegetation growth and
	
xiii	
Constructional deficiencies etc.
Shrinkage cracks occur within first few hours after initial set due to excessive bleeding and rapid 
early drying and result into loss of bond to bars and exposure of reinforcement.
Drying shrinkage cracks occur in walls and slabs and take a few weeks to years for development 
due to loss of moisture. They create path of seepage and leakage.
Thermal contraction cracks occur within first few weeks in thick walls and slabs due to excessive 
heat generation. Thermal contraction cracks could result into exposure of reinforcement, seepage 
and leaking.



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
14
Alkali aggregate reaction can be a cause of cracks on account of internal bursting force caused 
by expansive reaction of certain aggregates in high alkali content situations while frost damage 
can occur at any age in porous concrete.
Cracks due to corrosion in reinforcement take several months or years before it leads to rapid 
deterioration of concrete. Corrosion induced cracks are located directly above or below the 
reinforcement and occur parallel to rebars. Rust stains may be visible and such cracks can 
indicate loss of load carrying capacity with time.
Cracks due to sulphate attack may take several years to develop mostly near or below ground 
level on account of sulphate salts in damp ground reacting with the hydrated cement constituents.
Physical salt weathering requires many months to many years for development of cracks in the 
inter tidal and splash zone or just near ground level in desert terrain, leading to deposition of 
salts and volume changes and final disintegration.
Settlement cracks due to movement should be recorded and the cause of the cracks should be 
investigated and ascertained. Such cracks can be critical and affect the load carrying capacity 
of the bridge.
Structural cracks may be occurred due to overstressing which in turn can be due to the overloads 
or due to under-designed members or due to deficiency in construction. These cracks must be 
evaluated depending on the location, size and apparent cause.
Cracks caused by chemical reaction, alkali silica reaction can lead to serious damages to the 
concrete and loss of strength and capacity.
(b)	
Delamination
Delaminations are separations along a plane parallel to the surface of the concrete. These can 
be caused by corrosion of reinforcement. Bridge decks and corners of concrete beams, caps 
and columns are particularly susceptible to delamination and delaminations ultimately can cause 
spalling of concrete.
(c)	
Spalling
Spalling of concrete is generally recognized to be a serious defect as it can cause local weakening, 
expose reinforcement, impair riding quality of deck and with time can cause structural failure. 
Spall is a depression caused by separation and removal of surface concrete. Major causes of 
spalling are corrosion of the reinforcement, overstresses, etc.
(d)	
Leaching
Leaching is the accumulation of salt and lime deposits white in colour on the concrete surface. 
These are noticed normally on the underside of concrete decks and along cracks on vertical 
faces of abutment walls, wing walls etc. These indicate porous or cracked concrete. Where salts 
(NaCl or Sulphates) are present, the migration of moisture associated with leaching may initiate 
severe early deterioration.
(e)	
Scaling
Scaling is the manifestation on the surface of loss of concrete in patches. If the process continues, 
coarse aggregates can get exposed and become loose and disintegrated and may eventually 
get dislodged. Kerbs and parapet walls are particularly susceptible to scaling.

IRC:SP:40-2019
15
(f)	
Stains
Most significant stains is that due to rust which indicates presence of corrosion. But absence of 
rust is not necessarily indicative of no corrosion.
(g) 
Voids/Honeycombing
If tapping with a hammer or rod produces a ‘Hollow/Dead’ sound, this is indication of poor quality 
concrete without proper compaction or delamination. Internal voids may not be detected by 
hammer rap survey. If tapping produces metallic sound then the concrete is sound and well 
compacted.
(h)	
Deformations
These are the effects of distress which may show in the form of deflection, spalling, delaminations, 
scaling, cracks etc. Swelling or expansion of concrete is usually an indication of presence of 
reactive materials. However, localised swelling may be due to excessive compressive stress in 
the concrete. Twisting of substructure or superstructure units may be evidence of a settlement 
of foundation problem.
(i) 
Excessive Deflections
This could be due to deficiency in the structural capacity of the superstructure or due to passage 
of abnormal loads. Time dependent stresses also can cause such deflections if the estimated 
values of creep are different from the actual values.
(j)	
Holes in Deck Slab
This could be due to local weaknesses in concrete or other causes.
The above mentioned distresses may also applicable to plain cement concrete bridge elements 
also.
3.3.3	
Pre-stressed concrete
Most of the forms of distresses in pre-stressed concrete are similar to those in RCC. However, 
certain special features are as under:
(a)	
Cracking
Cracking in pre-stressed concrete is an indication of a potentially serious problem. Horizontal 
cracks near the ends of pre-stressed members may indicate a deficiency of reinforcing steel, 
to cater for bursting stresses. Vertical cracking in the lower portion of the member not near the 
support could be due to serious overstressing or loss of pre-stress. Vertical crack in the bottom 
of the unit and at the support may be a result of restricted movement in bearings. Vertical cracks 
in precast members above the neutral axis of a pre-stressed member can be due to mishandling 
during transportation or erection but these cracks close when dead load of the deck is applied. 
Transverse cracks on top of deck in cantilever bridges associated with vertical deflection at 
cantilever tip are result of prestress loss.
(b)	
Leaching
Leaching is also evidenced in pre-stressed bridges and the associated moisture movements 
will aggravate any corrosion risk. Particular attention needs to be paid to the concrete or mortar 
adjacent to joints in pre-stressed concrete e.g. box girders.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
16
(c)	
Stains
Rust stains in pre-stressed concrete indicate corrosion of pre-stressing cables and should 
be considered a serious threat to structural integrity of the member. No rust stain does not 
necessarily mean there is no corrosion.
(d)	
Spalling
Spalling in pre-stressed concrete is a serious problem and can result in loss of pre-stress.
(e)	
Excessive deformations
In pre-stressed members, the abnormal deflections could also occur due to loss of pre-stress 
with time.
(f)	
Abnormal Vibrations
These could be due to slender members or combination of various reasons.
(g)	
Environmental Effects
The pre-stressing strands or wires are adversely affected due to hostile environment and 
presence of chlorides, sulphates and carbonates etc. in grout/concrete. Load carrying capacity 
of the member thereby gets reduced due to loss of pre-stress.
3.3.4	
Steel
For various distresses in case of steel bridges and remedial measures reference may be made 
to IRC:SP:74 and IRC:SP:75.
3.3.4.1	
Normally observed defects in steel bridges are
	
i	
Corrosion
	
ii	
Excessive vibrations
	
iii	
Excessive deflections and deformations like buckling, kinking, warping and 
waving
	
iv	
Fractures
	
v	
Distresses in connections, and
	
vi	
Fatigue cracking
3.3.4.2	
Deterioration of steel
The causes of deterioration of steel are:
	
i	
Deterioration of the protective paint systems: may be due to accumulation of 
debris, accumulation of moisture, flaking of the paint, cracks in the paint
	
ii	
Corrosion
	
iii	
Rust: It may be Light rust formation & pitting the paint surface, Moderate rust 
formation with scales or flakes; and Severe rust formation & stratified rust or rust 
scale with pitting of the metal surface.
	
iv	
Electrolytic action - Other metals that are in contact with steel may cause 
corrosion similar to rust.

v	
Chemical or physical attack: It may be due to air and moisture, animal wastes, 
deicing agents, industrial fumes such as hydrogen sulphide, sea-water, and 
welds where the flux is not neutralized.
3.3.4.3	
Abnormal deformations or movements
They may include:
	
i	
Abnormal vertical deflection
	
ii	
Abnormal horizontal deflection
	
iii	
Long-term deformation e.g. creep and sagging
	
iv	
Abnormal vibration due to traffic and/or wind
	
v	
Excessive noise due to traffic
	
vi	
Excessive wear due to traffic of members accommodating movements such as 
pins
	
vii	
Buckling, kinking, warping and waviness due to overloading members in 
compression
	
viii	
Bent or twisted members due to vehicular impact
3.3.4.4	
Fracture and cracking
	
i	
Fracture: due to overloading, brittleness, stress corrosion and fatigue
	
ii	
Cracking: due to sudden change in the cross-section of members, in welds in 
adjacent metal because of stress fluctuations or stress concentrations.
3.3.4.5	
Loose bolts and rivets
It may be due to Overloads, Mechanical loosening and Excessive vibration.
3.3.5	
Composite bridges
In Composite bridges the distresses are normally the same as those for the masonry, concrete 
and/or steel bridges. However it is usually observed that the distresses like cracks are more 
common at the interface between two materials due to horizontal shear, the shear connectors 
being either absent or being of insufficient capacity.
3.3.6	
Timber bridges
Some of the normally observed distresses are:
	
i.	
Cracking and splitting of members due to overload, ageing or under-designing 
of members.
	
ii.	
Abnormal deflections due to overloads or under designing or imperfect joints.
	
iii.	
Infestations decay etc., due to environmental aggressiveness.
	
iv.	
Loosening of joints due to lack of good workmanship.
3.3.7	
Cable stay bridges
Nature of distresses for pre-stressed concrete girders and pylons would be similar to those 
referred in section 3.3.3 earlier. However for cable stay portion distresses generally observed 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
18
are as follows:
	
i	
Reduction of force in stay cable necessitating its augmentation or replacement 
of cable.
	
ii	
Corrosion of cable/strands requiring their replacement.
	
iii	
Disintegration of protective grout of the stay cable calling for re-grouting.
	
iv	
Damage to stay pipes or external ducts providing outer protection to the cables 
needing replacement of such pipes and ducts.
	
v	
Reduction in efficacy of corrosion protection system requiring its improvement & 
replenishment as necessary.
	
vi	
Reduction in the efficacy of dampeners.
3.3.8	
Extradosed bridges
Natures of distresses are similar to those referred in clause 3.3.7 for stay cable described above.
3.3.9	
Suspension bridges
Distresses in Suspension bridges shall be as per the materials used and have not been 
enumerated separately.
3.3.10	
Miscellaneous
Distresses in bearings and expansion joints manifest themselves in various forms and have 
been dealt with separately.
Although the normally observed distresses have been listed above, the bridge engineer should 
keep an open eye and reasoning attitude to observe any new type of unusual distress/behaviour

CHAPTER 4
TESTING AND DIAGONSIS
4.1	
Introduction
Most of the road bridges built in India are constructed in concrete. It is envisaged that concrete will 
continue to be the primary construction material for bridges in coming years also. Considerable 
investigations and research have been done in respect of concrete and more research is in 
progress. Based on research and field experience procedure for testing and diagnosis of concrete 
bridges has been updated and brought out in this chapter.
4.2	
Investigation
A desk study for review of available drawings to identify vulnerable areas and components 
should be done before investigation. In case drawings are not available, concerned engineer 
should provide basic details.
Identification of human and technical resources for investigation shall be done by an expert 
engineer.
Investigation is to be carried out at three stages – namely a visual survey to assess the overall 
integrity of the bridge. A general survey including a limited amount of physical testing to the extent 
possible and finally a detailed investigation to determine the extent and severity of deterioration 
is to be carried out.
4.3	
Visual Inspections
Visual inspection by an experienced bridge engineer who has previously handled similar 
situations is the most important basic and essential step. Generally the occurrence of distress 
becomes apparent much before the load carrying capacity is adversely affected. However, it is 
likely that in some pre-stressed concrete structures, manifestation of distress may not be very 
distinct and clear. Warning signals of distresses are indicated by spalling, rust stains, cracks, 
excessive deflections, abnormal vibrations, loss of camber, malfunctioning of bearings & joints, 
leakages and deformation of structural elements etc. During inspection, these signs should be 
verified and noted.
Arrangement of proper access to various components of the bridge is a pre-requisite prior to 
embarking on this task to ensure thorough inspection.
4.4	
Testing Methods
A variety of semi-destructive and non-destructive testing methods are available for investigating 
different properties of concrete in addition to vital visual inspection described earlier. Tests are 
aimed at assessment of strength and other properties and to locate and obtain comparative 
results indicating weaker regions, cracks, delaminations and areas of lower integrity than the 
rest. It is essential to emphasize here, that it is not necessary to carry out all the tests in each 
case except the most relevant one. It is necessary to arrive at essential tests considering visual 
inspection report. As a matter of fact, in certain cases, engineering judgment would help to take 
decisions faster. Details of various tests and their suitability and availability are given in the 
Table 4.1. Different tests related to corrosion in RCC and PSC structure are mentioned under 
Note below the Table 4.1.

The various testing methods are detailed in Appendix-I
4.5	
Guidelines for Non-Destructive Methods
It is necessary to have detailed discussion between bridge authority and the group who is 
assigned the task of carrying out the tests to recognize the difficulties in the field to enable them 
to arrive at a realistic program.
Prior estimation of various design parameters with high and low assumptions as regards to the 
assessment of bridge condition is needed. This will facilitate the choice of best suited technology 
and fixing operating limits during the tests.
The various non-destructive and other evaluation methods have several limitations as there are 
various parameters influencing each test and many a time combination of different methods 
have to be used during investigations.
Use all necessary means so that cost remains optimum. For this purpose fix just adequate number 
of measurements points and use suitable alternate methods wherever available methods.
A general summary of capabilities of the various test methods to detect different forms of defects 
or deterioration is given in the Table 4.2.

4.7	
Full Scale Load Testing of Bridges
The above techniques present possibility of making an assessment of the overall condition of 
the bridge or changes in the condition and of detecting faults. But it is often difficult to analyse 
the effects or defects or deterioration on the overall performance of the bridge or on the stresses 
in individual components. A full scale load test can, therefore, be useful. Load tests can be 
expensive and on larger bridges they require considerable planning, involve many people and 
demand the use of sophisticated equipment. Testing in remote locations can present additional 
difficulties. Particular care is needed for bridges with brittle failure modes. However, load testing 
can often be justified where the effect of defects and/ or deterioration on load capacity cannot 
be determined by analysis alone. However, a decision to carry out full scale load testing should 
not be undertaken without a serious thought. The procedure and acceptance criteria for load 
rating of bridges is given in IRC:SP:37 and for load testing IRC:SP:51. The instrumentation and 
equipment needed for load testing is also elaborated in the above mentioned guidelines. The 
following may also be considered with regard to load testing of bridges:



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
26
	
(a)	
Bridge testing is both an art and a science. In its simplest form, load testing involves 
measuring the response of the bridge to a known applied load. Considerable 
experience is required to know where to locate gauges and to determine load 
increments and the maximum load to be applied to prevent damage to the 
bridges. The load is applied, usually by vehicles although occasionally by dead 
load or through cables, to induce maximum effects. Where measurement of 
stress at given location under known load is all that is required, data processing 
may not be a major consideration. In other cases, the amount of data recorded 
is often extensive such that automatic data recording and analysis is highly 
desirable. It is also preferable that this be done on site as the test progresses 
so that deviations from anticipated behavior are known and the necessary 
changes in procedure or equipment can be made. Because concrete properties 
are required to define stress values (from strain measurements), samples must 
be taken from the structure.
	
(b)	
Jacks, duly calibrated, can be used to measure the reactions at the supports of 
the structure. This may be required for such purpose as assessing the impact 
of thermal gradients, or the re-distribution of stresses due to creep, settlement 
or faulty construction. In addition to the requirement for suitable jacking points 
the deck joints must be removed together with any other feature which might 
interfere with the free movement of the jack. Alternatively, for better accuracy 
and to obtain direct reading, appropriate and duly calibrated load cells, may be 
used to give support reactions within a range of 0.3 to 1.0 %.

CHAPTER 5
REPAIRS AND STRENGTHENING TECHNIQUES – GENERAL
5.1	
Criteria for Selection
It is intended to cover in this chapter only the more important techniques and materials used 
for bridge repairs and strengthening. The maintenance techniques, described in IRC:SP:35 for 
inspection and maintenance of bridges, are not repeated. The criteria for selection of methods, 
materials and techniques for repairs and strengthening would be governed by the following 
factors:
	
(i)	
Bridge condition
	
(ii)	
Type of the distress
	
(iii)	 Causes of distresses
	
(iv)	 Location, Extent and Severity of distress
	
(v)	
Availability of materials, equipment and techniques
	
(vi)	 Efficacy of the materials and techniques in the preservation and/or enhancing 
the load carrying capacity of the structure
	
(vii)	 Importance of the bridge
	
(viii)	 Time available
	
(ix)	 Life Expectancy, future maintenance
	
(x)	
Aesthetic
	
(xi)	 Feasibility of traffic diversion
	
(xii)	 Structural system of the bridge superstructure
	
(xiii)	 Type of substructure and foundations
	
(xiv)	 Waterway condition
	
(xv)	 Type of environment in which bridge is located
5.2	
Foundations
It is not possible to evolve a general method for repairs and/or strengthening of foundations 
(as they are generally out of sight).Each case has to be analysed individually and may require 
special investigations. Most repair works for foundations are in the category of protection and 
strengthening. Some examples are given below:
	
i)	
Scour and erosion protection
	
ii)	
Repair of washed away/damaged protection works
	
iii)	
Repair of foundations built on soft strata subjected to erosion
	
iv)	
Strengthening of foundations necessitated by additional load due to settlement 
of soft strata under the foundation

v)	
Remedying the effects of horizontal movements of abutments
	
vi)	
Strengthening of foundations due to widening of a waterway or road
	
vii)	
Extending existing foundations
	
viii)	 Repair of underwater/ submerged bridge components
	
ix)	
Repair of eroded/abraded concrete surface caused by high velocity of particles 
in the water
	
x)	
Impact due to boulders etc.
Foundation movements can substantially increase the loads and moments in some parts of 
the superstructure by redistribution. This must always be checked for. Given the wide range 
of materials and repairs techniques the choice of the most appropriate technique is difficult. 
Nature of distresses in concrete bridge structure together with important remedial measures in 
principle are given in Table 5.1. In addition to this, remedial measures are indicated according to 
component of the bridge and distressed observed and which are briefly, given in Table No. 5.2

Some of the repair works carried out for foundations is described below. IRC:89 shall be used 
for more guidance.
(1)	
Erosion Problems
Gabions, mattresses, rip-rap, boulders, stone/concrete block pitching, geo-textiles bags/tubes, 
grouting etc, can be used for erosion of bed as well as banks. For the details of materials, design 
etc. Handbook for flood protection, anti erosion and river training by Central Water Commission 
may be referred.
(2)	
Protection against Scour
Excessive scour is one of the major factors that may cause or lead to structural failure or distress 
of the foundation. The degree of damage depends on factors such as stream bed material, 
intensity of discharge, silt charge, obliquity of stream flow and shape of the structure. For deciding 
the extent and type of repair for scour, ascertaining the causative factors, such as change in the 
alignment of the stream, an inadequate waterway or the presence of debris, is of great help. 
Providing the most effective solution to a scour is challenging and may require model studies.
Spur dykes, jetties, deflectors and other measures may be constructed to deviate water away 
from a fill, bridge pier, or abutment. Only correctly designed and constructed training works 
are helpful in controlling scour which may vary from simple solution such as replacement of 
displaced material to complicated solutions like jacketing, sheet piling, strengthening the footing

or training works.
Piers and abutments may be protected or repaired by placing sheet piling Sheet piling should 
be driven to a depth where non-erodible soil conditions or rock exist. The overhead clearance 
required or under substructures may be a major disadvantage in deciding sheet piling.
If supporting material has been removed from under a large area of the footing, consideration 
should be given to redesigning the foundation, including filling the void with concrete. In some 
cases, the footing may be extended by using sheet piling as forms for the extension and as stay 
in-place protection against the scour. In case of exposed supporting piles, particularly if they 
are short it may be necessary to drive supplemental piles that are as a part of the extended 
foundation.
Around piers it is common to provide what is known as ‘garlanding technique’. In this, very heavy 
concrete blocks or stones of designed size and weight are placed around the pier foundations 
below the bed level by excavation. This technique can also be used during floods by dropping 
heavy stones or blocks from a distance on upstream side depending upon the velocity of water 
and weight of stones after trials. This would save excavation and special arrangements in 
Perennial River.
(3)	
Foundation on soft rock subject to erosion can be protected by reinforced concrete 
curtain walls enclosing the footing.
(4)	
The bearing capacity of the soil can be increased by injecting cement or chemical 
grout such that grout pressure does not exceed the overburden pressures.
(5)	
Rock or ground anchors are often used for erosion around abutments taking into 
account various factors likely to affect the bearing capacity and durability of the anchoring system.
(6)	
Extension of Existing Foundations
This would be necessary while widening an existing bridge. The foundation, substructure 
or superstructure of widened portion may be of same or the different material and structural 
configuration.
(7)	
Liquefaction of Foundation Soil
Some foundation failures could be the result of excessive soil movements especially due to 
liquefaction during earthquakes. There are two approaches to retrofitting that will mitigate these 
types of failures. This may be mitigate either by replacement/stabilization of soil or strengthening 
of the structure to withstand excessive relative displacements.
Possible methods for soil stabilization include: Lowering of ground water table, Consolidation of 
soil by vibro-floatation or sand compaction; Placement of permeable over-burden; grouting or 
chemical injection.
At a site subjected to excessive liquefaction, methods to strengthening of the structure as well 
as stabilization of the soil may be necessary.
(8)	
Underwater Work
While dealing with underwater work, it will be relevant to refer to underwater inspection also. 
Inspection of underwater portions of the structures is very difficult because of the harsher 
environment, poor visibility, deposition of marine organisms etc. To do an effective underwater 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
34
inspection, it is necessary to deploy properly trained and equipped personnel. The quality of 
underwater inspection must be same as that of above water. Cleaning the marine growth from 
underwater portions of a bridge is always necessary. Visual inspection is a primary work of 
detecting underwater problems. In turbid waters, the inspector should use tactile examination 
to detect flaws, damage or deterioration. In some cases sophisticated techniques, ultra-sonic 
thickness gauges, computerized tomography or TV monitors may be used. After the initial 
identification of the damage, it may be necessary either to expose the member by means of a 
cofferdam and dewatering or by providing a small air-lock as described later for the purpose of 
detailed examination and carrying out repairs.
Underwater photographic techniques are also available wherein damages are detected by divers 
who can take photos, videos or scan the various components of affected areas, which can be 
displayed on a screen/monitor on the bridge deck.
Acoustic microscopic measurements or tomography can be used for identification of defects of 
underwater bridge components. But, Sonar procedures for mapping scour are useful.
For underwater repairs the surfaces of the pile or well or pier have to be cleaned of the dirt and 
other foreign materials and after removing the cracked and unsound concrete, the surface shall 
be ready for receiving new concrete. It is often useful to provide temporary cofferdam. Suitable 
priming coat by materials like moisture compatible may be helpful to ensure proper bonding. 
Placing of concrete under water can be carried out with the help of conventional underwater 
bucket/tremie concrete, pre-packed concrete, bagged concrete or pumped concrete depending 
on the site conditions.
The piles or wells which are substantially deteriorated by corrosion or other defects can be 
provided with integral jackets which may or may not be reinforced depending on the thickness of 
the jacket. Joint of the jacket at its ends have to be properly detailed out and treated with suitable 
adhesive. Grouting with quick setting cement or epoxy can also be carried out where necessary. 
Methods used to perform underwater sealing and repairing of cracks by suitable grout injections 
are similar to methods used above water, except that for underwater use, grout must be water 
insensitive. Before application of surface sealer, cleaning is necessary. If oil or other contaminants 
are present in the cracks, and the sealer is used for restoring the strength of the cracked concrete 
pier or pile instead of simply blocking the free entry of water in the crack, bonding will be improved 
by mixing detergents or special chemicals with a water jet to clean the crack interiors. After all 
cracks are prepared and sealed and the nipples positioned, the low viscosity adhesive is injected 
under pressure into the cracked area.
Various methods used to prevent the corrosion of steel piling in sea water, include application 
of protective coatings, encasement of steel in concrete or a combination of these procedures. 
Cathodic protection can also be used.
5.3	
Repairs to Masonry Structures
Existing masonry bridges are to be considered as historical landmarks and need preservation. 
Strengthening and widening maintaining the same appearance. Widening is usually not possible 
but strengthening can often be done. Strengthening of Masonry Bridges ensuring pleasant 
appearance is a delicate task and expertise is required. Some of the defects and remedial 
measures for stone or brick masonry arch bridges are given below.



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
35
(i)	
Loss of Bond for the Crown/ Key Stone: Flat jacks can be used for pushing the 
stone back to its original position. Generally, low pressure grouting is done to strengthen the old 
mortar. A suitable pre-bagged grouting material similar in mechanical properties to the existing 
jointing material should be used for effective bond.
(ii)	
Longitudinal Cracks along the Direction of Traffic: it is possible to rake mortar 
joints and refill with a polymer modified mortar similar in mechanical properties to the existing 
jointing material. Fine material grouting in the form of injection can be adopted for remedial 
measures. Grouting can also be done by using suitable polymer modified grouts depending 
upon size of cracks and mechanical properties expected. However it must be mentioned that 
the depth of penetration of grout is important, as usually it is not possible, to suspend traffic. If 
possible, the portion of earth fill could be removed to ensure that penetration is limited to masonry 
only. This can be achieved by controlled grouting and proper spacing of inlet for grouting. Fiber 
Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) can also be used to strengthen the bridge by means of 
wrapping.
(iii)	
Transverse Cracks: Injection of, polymer or suitable grout as per size of cracks will 
provide a good bond between stones and brick masonry.
(iv)	
Strengthening of Arch Rings: The arch ring can be strengthened either by adding 
material to the intrados or to the extrados. The arch can be strengthened by constructing an RCC 
Arch below the masonry arch with suitable dowel connection. The intrados of the masonry arch 
can be used as formwork. For supporting the RCC Arch, necessary jacket can be provided to pier 
and foundation with suitable anchorage with old structure. In order to arrest lateral movement of 
arch, suitable reinforcement can be placed connecting rings of both sides of arch and anchored 
at ends.
(v)	
Strengthening of Arch by helical reinforcement: Using helical stainless steel ties 
and bars, which have good axial strength combined with sufficient lateral flexibility which allows 
the structure to move naturally and therefore minimize additional stresses. Details of helical 
reinforcement and its embedment at various locations of arch as given in Fig. 5.1 below:
Fig. 5.1(a) A view of Heical Reinforcement

IRC:SP:40-2019
36
Fig. No. 5.1 (c) Provision of Helical Reinforcement for Arch
The helical reinforcement can be used for minimizing movement in spandrel walls, separation 
of brick arch rings, cracking in arch barrel, delaminated masonry, cracked piers, wing walls and 
abutments, cracked and unstable parapet walls.
A more effective, but at times an expensive, treatment is to remove the fill and cast the extra 
required thickness on the extrados of the arch. Usually, a full ring is cast but occasionally only 
the end quarters are strengthened to act as cantilevers and reduce the effective span of the 
arch. Normal concrete placing techniques are satisfactory. Replacement backfill may be with 
normal or lightweight concrete. The latter will reduce dead load on the foundations but may also 
reduce the factor of safety for stability of the substructure.
Another expedient which is satisfactory where the increase in load carrying capacity is relatively 
small, especially for small span bridges, is to cast slab at road level to act as an auxiliary deck. 
Strengthening of soffit of arch including arch elements such as spandrels can be done by the use 
of tie bar and jacketing with ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete or CFRP.
The fiber reinforced cementitious matrix is similar to carbon fiber fabrics and are embedded in 
a ductile cementitious matrix instead of epoxy, which has extremely high compressive strength. 
This material has many advantages over CFRP and they are:
	
•	
FRCM allows the application on wet surface, provides a high thermal resistance 
and similar fire resistance as concrete. Helps maintain ductility of structures 
strengthened.
	
•	
Suitable for enhancing flexural, shear and compressive strength of structural 
elements.
	
•	
Low thickness with a minimum increase of the cross-section on the structure. 
Keeps the geometry and appearance of the strengthened elements.
	
•	
Long lasting, it is highly resistant to abrasion, not affected by corrosion process, 
withstands marine environments and freeze-thaw cycles.

Economical system with no maintenance. Very easy and quick to use, saving 
labour costs and reducing use of auxiliary tools.
5.4	
Repairs to Concrete Structures
The majority of bridge structures will be either concrete, RCC or Pre-stressed Concrete, 
techniques for repairs to concrete structures are described in a separate Chapter 6.
5.5	
Repairs to Composite Structures
Comparatively very few defects have been reported with well-designed and fabricated shear 
connectors in composite structures. Problems with concrete decks in composite structures are 
essentially of the same kind and order of magnitude as those found in concrete decks in regular 
structure. It is likely that some early structures are seriously inadequate with regard to shear 
connectors for the heavier design loads now specified. The same can be also said for the main 
load carrying structural steel components.
Difficulties may be encountered with deck replacement or even major deck rehabilitation and 
strengthening operations in those composite bridges in which residual relieving stresses have been 
introduced by sophisticated erection procedures combined with an elaborated casting sequences 
for the bridge deck. Such cases would be very few in this country. Prior to concreting deck slab, 
use of very high pressure water jetting say usually beyond 70 MPa, to remove the concrete around 
shear connectors is considered preferable to jack hammers so as to minimize damage.
5.6	
Repairs to Steel Structures
5.6.1	
Deck Replacement
Many of the old bridges, usually truss or arch bridges, having either warped steel plates with a 
bituminous surfacing or a concrete deck often get corroded due to insufficient waterproofing of 
steel plates.
Bridge decks can be replaced by new concrete decks or by new orthotropic steel decks, specially 
for reduction in weight or for widening. The use of light weight concrete is often preferred for 
reducing the loads. Bolting is the preferred method of connecting the new deck system to existing 
structural members.
Steel grid decking can either be left open or filled with concrete.
5.6.2	
Strengthening of Structural Members
Strengthening usually involves more conventional techniques such as replacement of members, 
diaphragms or plate bonding either with bolts or welds. Strengthening of plate girders can be 
done by adding stiffness to flanges, webs and diaphragms or by external pre-stressing.
5.6.3	
Repair of Cracks
Cracks can be due to any one or a combination of the following reasons:
	
i)	
High stress concentrations joints/location due to in appropriate detailing or loose 
connections may be avoided by champher
	
ii)	
Increased traffic loading

iii)	
An unexpected secondary loads
	
iv)	
Poor workmanship
	
v)	
Reduction in strength due to corrosion
Crack repair methods depend on the root cause of crack development/formation as well as its 
location, width etc. The structure and especially those components which influence the overall 
safety and stability of the structure should be analyzed.
5.6.4	
Action to be taken when a crack is detected or suspected in welded steel bridge 
girders
Reference is invited to IRC:SP:104 for fabrication & erection; IRC:SP:74 for repair, rehabilitation 
of steel & steel composite bridges and IRC:SP:75 for retro-fitting of steel bridges.
	
i)	
Location, length, orientation and ends should be marked distinctly on the 
members as well as sketches to monitor crack propagation. Photographs and 
videos may be taken and appropriately labeled.
	
ii)	
If necessary, cracks should be examined in detail by NDT tests like magnifying 
glass, dye penetration, ultrasonic etc.
	
iii)	
If more identical details exist on the girder, they should also be inspected in 
detail.
	
iv)	
Cracks should be fully documented in the bridge inspection register and action 
initiated for its early repair.
	
v)	
If situation warrants, suitable speed restriction may be imposed.
	
vi)	
Significance of crack on the load carrying capacity of the girder should be studied 
and retrofitting or repair scheme should be planned.
	
vii)	
Repairs can be made either by replacement of cracked section, plate bonding, 
welding, strengthening etc.
5.6.5	
Underwater Welding
Arc or gas welding is commonly used in underwater repairs. However this process is expensive.
5.6.6	
Use of Steel Arch superposition Scheme
This can be used to strengthen old truss bridges. The strengthening scheme consists of 
superimposed arches, hangars and additional floor beams. The concept of combining a truss 
with an arch is by no means a new system. The idea is that a light arch can carry a significant 
load if properly supported laterally. In this case, the truss with its cross-beams provided the lateral 
support while the arch in combination with the hangars and additional floor beams provides the 
increased load carrying capacity. Additional floor beams and hangars are used for two reasons:
	
i)	
The more uniform the load distribution, the more efficient the arch will be in 
carrying the load.
	
ii)	
The floor systems of many old truss bridges get deteriorated and are sometimes 
under-designed and unreliable.

IRC:SP:40-2019
39
The scheme of strengthening by a steel arch superposition is illustrated in Fig. 5.2
Fig. 5.2 Strengthening by a Steel Arch Superposition
The thrust of the arch can be resisted by one of the following means:
	
•	
The abutments, provided they are adequate and in good condition, or they can 
readily be repaired or strengthened.
	
•	
A reinforced lower chord.
	
•	
Superimposed cables or rods.
	
•	
Properly designed and detailed stingers or floor slab.
The arch superposition scheme can be considered as an overall strengthening measure. The load 
carrying capacity of the entire structure is upgraded, thus allowing the live load to be increased. 
There is no need for temporary shoring or jacking for the installations of the super positioned 
elements. Increase in dead load can be expected to be in order of approximately 15 % to 20 % 
percent. Slender arch contributes only modest amounts of additional stiffness to the truss.
5.6.7	
Use of External Pre-stressing: Reference is invited to IRC:SP:67 & IRC:24.
5.6.8	
Excessive Vibrations
These can be overcome by suitable structural alterations and increase damping for which 
dynamic behavior of structures have to be investigated.
5.7	
Repairs to Timber Structures
Except for giving treatment to wood, there are no special techniques for repairs of timber 
structures. The distressed members could be either replaced or strengthened with steel plates.

CHAPTER 6
REPAIRS AND STRENGTHENING TECHNIQUES FOR CONCRETE BRIDGES
6.1 
Repair Works
Repair works may be categorized as below:
	
(i)	
Repair of the concrete surface
	
(ii)	
Repair of cracks
	
(iii)	 Repair of corroded reinforcement
	
(iv)	 Repairs related to high tensile steel in Pre-stressed concrete (PSC)
	
(v)	
Repair of honeycombed concrete voids and holes
	
(vi)	 Repairs to damages/disintegrated/crushed components
6.1.1	
Preparation of the surface
In all cases where of repaired, the condition of the existing concrete in the exposed area is of 
primary importance in the durability of the repair. The latter can be seriously compromised if 
there is a poor adhesion between the fresh concrete of the repair and the existing concrete 
surface. Therefore, it is important that the contact surface to be repaired is in hard and sound 
condition. In general, all foreign / loose / soft /damaged and fractured concrete materials are 
removed that might affect or other impair the repair and must be properly treated. The methods 
for preparation of surfaces can be categorised as below:
	
•	
Mechanical methods
	
•	
Hydraulic methods
	
•	
Thermal methods and
	
•	
Chemical methods
The choice of a suitable method depends on the type, location, extent and severity of distress 
as well as the thickness of the layer of the damage in the structure which has to be treated. The 
thermal and chemical methods are rarely used and are restricted to special circumstances and 
hence have not been described here.
i.	
Mechanical Methods
The Mechanical equipment is preferable, as it is more intensive, reliable and speedy. While 
choosing and applying mechanical methods, it must be ensured that the sound concrete and the 
reinforcement are not damaged. If necessary, trials should be carried out. The commonly used 
mechanical methods are jack hammers, milling, chipping, sand blasting, steam blasting and 
compressed air cleaning. During a mechanical surface treatment of concrete, dust will always 
occur, and therefore the surface must be free of dust before start of the repair work.
ii.	
Hydraulic Methods
Hydraulic methods such as use of water jetting or blasting can also be used and are considered 
preferable to jack hammers for damage prevention. A water jet with 10 to 40 MPa pressure at 
the jet shall remove loose particles, scaled concrete or vegetation coatings. This method is not 
applicable for roughening of solid concrete surface. High pressure water-jet the pressure 40 to 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
41
120 MPa at the jet is most efficient for removal of soft areas of the concrete surface. In hydro-jet 
method, with the jet pressure at 140 – 240 MPa a deep penetration into the concrete or even 
cutting grooves is possible. This method is essentially free of vibrations, but there will be deep 
penetration of moisture into the concrete and needs careful handling or else could be hazardous.
6.1.2	
Bonding agents
(a)	
General
Bonding agents are recommended to improve the bond between old concrete and the repair 
concrete. There are two types of bonding mechanisms as below:
	
-	
Physical bond through adhesion and cohesion; and
	
-	
Chemical adhesion through reaction with the surface
In most cases, both types of bonding exist in combination. There are various types of bonding 
agents.
(b) 
Cement Paste/Slurry
The cement paste with a low water/cement ratio is used as bonding agent which is applied by 
brush on to the surface to be repaired.
(c)	
Cement Mortar
A cement mortar consisting of equal parts of cement and sand along with water of requisite 
viscosity may be used as bonding agent. It can, also be used for the repair itself wherein the 
coarse aggregate has been absent.
(d) 
Polymer Modified Cement Paste/Mortar
The polymer mixed into the cement paste or cement mortar via the mixing water can also be used 
as bonding agent for greater adhesion. The plasticizers with certain portions of solid substances 
such as Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) polymer or acrylic resin may be added to the mix. 
The emulsions may also be used. The bonding effect depends on the type of polymer/additive 
being used. These additives are used to improve the workability and water retention capacity in 
addition to improve the bond strength.
(e)	
Resins
There are two basic types of bonding agents made of resins namely; emulsified agents and 
normal agents. The first case consists of a combination of a water emulsified epoxy, resin, a 
polyamide resin hardener and a filling material. The epoxy/resin and the hardener are initially 
mixed together before placement. If required, the mixture may be diluted with water. In the two 
component resin bonding agents, a pure resin-hardener-mixture is used, with or without fillers. 
Filler may be added in a suitable design ratio. Filling materials mixed with resins are used for 
following reasons.
	
-	
Filling materials prevent a deep penetration of resin into the old concrete.
	
-	
Filling materials prevent a penetration of resin into the new concrete
	
-	
Filling materials are less expensive than epoxy/resins and
	
-	
Resins with fillers can be placed in thicker layers.

6.1.3	
Repair of concrete surfaces
6.1.3.1	
Surface protection measures
A concrete surface exposed to climatic effects will change its structure and physical appearance 
with time. Therefore, the durability of a structural element cannot be assessed only from the 
physical appearance of its surface.
The composition of the external surface layers is comparatively different from the interior of the 
structural element, in particular the cement content is more towards the surface. The concrete 
surface, for desired aesthetic appearance, should not affect the durability of the structural 
element. If the concrete is to be protected from the external influences and enhancement of an 
already existing weathering is of concern, measures need to be taken to either minimize or stop 
this process. The following measures in the order of increasing surface protection can be used:
	
-	
Hydrophobation
	
-	
Impregnation
	
-	
Painting
	
-	
Sealers and
	
-	
Coatings
There is a difference in how protection is achieved from impregnation systems and sealers and/
or coating systems. Protection is achieved in the impregnation system through a prevention of 
a capillary absorption of water by the concrete. Depending on the material used, this effect will 
be achieved by a hydrophobation of the pores at the surfaces or by a narrowing of the capillary 
ducts, which result from a film formation on these surfaces. Sealers or coatings lead to a closed 
thin film on the surface.
6.1.3.2	
Materials and techniques of application
(a)	
The efficiency of an impregnation basically depends on the preparation of the surface 
and on the required depth of impregnation. Requirements for impregnation material are small 
molecular size and low viscosity. The absorption is accomplished via the capillary voids of the 
concrete. The proportion of capillary voids increases with increasing water/cement ratio. The 
impregnation liquid must be placed on the concrete surface in an amount to fill the voids. The 
application may be accomplished by means of a brush, lambskin roller or by spraying. Depending 
on the absorptive capacity of the surface, several repetitions may be necessary. For solvent 
containing impregnation systems, the concentration of the solution during the first application 
may require thinning to achieve a deeper penetration. Penetration depth is especially important 
where traffic wear is expected. Therefore, impregnation protection systems are only suitable 
where the concrete surface will not be removed by abrasion, damaged or locally affected by the 
formation of cracks.
While impregnation with resins may be successfully used on horizontal surfaces, hydrophobizing 
impregnations are not suitable for horizontal surfaces where water will stay on the surface. 
Therefore, the primary field of application of hydrophobizing impregnations is on vertical or 
sloped surfaces, where the water can flow off easily.
(b)	
Sealers: Is a treatment to concrete to reduce the surface porosity and strengthen the 
surface. These are also often referred to as surface primers or sealers.
	
•	
The pores and capillaries are partially or totally filled.

•	
Treatment leads usually to a discontinuous, thin film on the surface.
	
•	
Binders may be Low Viscosity, Filler Free compositions based on organic / 
inorganic polymers such as Acrylics, Epoxy, PU, PMMA or Silicone Resins.
(c)	
Coatings: Is a treatment to produce a continuous protective layer on the surface of 
the concrete. Thickness is typically of 0.1 to 5.0 mm. Particular applications may require higher 
thickness than 5 mm.
The materials for coatings to be used shall be organic / inorganic polymers such as Acrylics, Epoxy, 
PU, PMMA or Silicone Resins (individual or in combination) with or without fillers. These coatings 
may also be referred to in common terminology such as but not limited to: Anti-Carbonation 
Coatings, Poly-Urethane (PU) Coatings, Bridge Deck Waterproofing Systems, Coal-Tar Epoxy 
Systems, Epoxy or PU Coatings. Compared to sealers, coatings have an increased resistance 
to the diffusion of internal moisture and provide an additional protection against mechanical 
influence.
A differentiation should be made between thin and thick coatings. Thin coatings, will follow the 
contour of any unevenness of the surface while a thick coating will smooth out any unevenness 
of the surface. Coatings should also have the capability to bridge cracks. This requires a high 
elasticity of the coating material.
Some systems, however, are not sufficiently resistant to mechanical loads and need an additional 
protective layer. They may also be used as a membrane underneath asphalt overlays. A special 
mention needs to be made in terms of protective coatings. Piers above the tidal zone and the 
superstructures are best coated with Anti-Carbonation Acrylic, Elastic-Elastomeric coating. The 
system comprises water based (solvent free), conforming to code and specification, acrylic 
polymer modified with selected mineral fillers, applied over the prepared surface to form an 
anticarbonation elastic elastomeric protective membrane.
The coating should have anti carbonation and water vapor diffusion property and should be 
resistant to action of UV radiation. It should be waterproof and capable of bridging crazings and 
cracks. The coating protects exposed faces of the superstructure and the substructure of concrete 
bridges from the aggressive action of industrially polluted and marine/saline environment.
The specifications of the coating can be taken from IRC:SP:80 or from MORTH - Specifications 
for Road & Bridge Works.
Another specific coating system is one for protection of Bridge Decks. This system is also 
often referred to as Bridge Deck Waterproofing. These coatings can be based on either Epoxy, 
Polyurethane or Polyurea based Systems. These materials should have adequate crack bridging 
ability to withstand thermal stresses.
The coating systems shall have requisite certifications along with national and international 
reference with proven for performance.
6.1.3.3	
Replacement of substantial depth of concrete section
If the deterioration has reached a level where a shallow surface repair may not be sufficient, 
a replacement of the affected concrete section should be considered. The choice of the repair 
material depends on volume to be replaced, the depth of the repair, the loading effects to be 
expected and the site conditions. In all cases, an appropriate pre-treatment of surface is required.



======================================================================

The various measures for damage repair may, in addition, require surface protection measures 
to provide for durability of repair. The following materials for replacement of a substantial depth 
loss of concrete surface should be considered:
	
-	
Polymer modified, cement-bond systems; and
	
-	
Cement mortar or concrete (normally concrete similar to original mix but with 
reduced water cement ratio or higher grade of concrete is best).
	
-	
Shotcrete (gunite): Shotcrete is suitable for the repair of surface damages, 
concrete replacement as well as for the strengthening of structural elements.
Pre-treatment of the surface is of prime importance while using shotcrete. Sand blasting has 
proved to be an efficient surface treatment procedure. However, environmental protection 
regulations should be verified before use. The surface should be sufficiently pre-moistened. No 
bonding agent is necessary because at the interface surface, mortar enrichment occurs as a 
result of aggregate rebound.
Shotcreting in multiple layers requires that the preceding layer achieves a sufficient degree 
of hardness. Minimum reinforcement may be required for thicknesses larger than 50 mm. 
The reinforcement should be fixed in position in such a manner that it remains stiff/firm and 
keeps its position during shotcreting operations and to ensure adequate cover in the finished 
works.
Curing may be accomplished by an evaporation protection, e.g. plastic sheet. If a freeze-thaw/
salt resistant concrete is required, air entrainment admixtures may have to be added to the 
concrete mix. Also, surface protection measures may become necessary. There are two basis 
shotcrete processes:
	
i)	
A dry mix process where most of the mixing water is added at the nozzle and the 
cement-sand mixture is carried by compressed air through the delivery hose to 
a special nozzle, and 
	
ii)	
A wet mix process where all of the ingredients, including water, are mixed before 
entering the delivery hose.
Shotcrete suitable for normal construction requirements can be produced by either process. 
However, differences in cost of equipment, maintenance and operational features may make 
one or the other more feasible for a particular application.
Properly applied shotcrete is a structurally adequate and durable material and is capable of 
excellent bond with concrete, masonry, steel and some other materials. However, these favorable 
properties are contingent on proper planning, supervision, skill and continuous attention by the 
application crew.
In general, the in-place physical properties of sound shotcrete are comparable to those of 
conventional mortar or concrete having the same composition.
Special variants of shotcretes result from the addition of polymers, fibers or of synthetic resins. 
Steel, glass (boron-silicate-glass) and plastics are used for the fibers. The ratio of the fiber to 
cement will be larger in the initial mixture than in the rebound material. The last layer must not 
contain steel fibers. In the case of steel fibers, corrosion protections must be considered, unless 
the fibers are protected from corrosion.

6.1.4	
Removal and replacement of concrete
This is considered necessary when the concrete is found to be delaminated by sounding with 
hammer or chloride ion content is critical or micro cracks are found on a chipped surface or 
concrete is carbonated upto to reinforcement. The removal of damaged concrete is usually done 
with electrically powered or compressed air ensuring that the reinforcement is not damaged. Flat 
chisel is normally used to minimize micro crack formation which can cause repair failures. For 
a complete removal of a structural element larger equipment such as sawing, cracking, thermal 
lancing and blasting may also be adopted. Special care needs to be taken while removing 
concrete in pre-stressed concrete structures. Hydro demolition is the latest method where water 
is sprayed on to the concrete in thin jets at a very high pressure and enables removing of 
concrete in a more efficient and precise manner without damaging reinforcement and in a better 
working environment.
The replacement of concrete in larger continuous areas should proceed in the same manner as 
during the construction of the concrete structure. However, certain features resulting from the 
combination of old and new concrete should be considered.
Placing concrete in the area to be repaired should be accomplished in such a manner as not 
to impede concrete flow and to avoid the entrapment of air, thus avoiding voids in the concrete. 
Therefore, the formwork must be sufficiently rigid and tightly fitted to the existing concrete in a 
manner to minimize leakage of cement paste. The surface of the existing concrete will require 
adequate preparation, careful cleaning and pre-moistening.
The replacement concrete should have final properties that match the existing concrete as 
closely as possible (strength, modulus of elasticity, creep co-efficient, etc.) To avoid temperature 
and shrinkage cracks, especially in the transition area, the type of cement, cement content and 
the water/cement ratio should be carefully evaluated.
The use of plasticizers is recommended. Re-compaction /re-vibration may be required to improve 
the contact to the old concrete; however, care should be exercised to avoid a re-tempering of 
concrete after an initial set. Trial repairs on non-critical structures are essential before the main 
work is undertaken.
For larger concrete volumes, minimizing the temperature difference between old and new 
concrete may require special procedure (cooling of new concrete and/or heating of old concrete). 
Type and duration of curing should be evaluated on a case by case basis.
6.1.5	
Repair of cracks and other defects
6.1.5.1	
General
Before deciding the most appropriate methods/material for repairing/sealing cracks a study 
should be made on the cause of the cracks ascertain and whether they are active or dormant. 
Crack activity (propagation or breathing) may be determined by periodic observations with 
gauges, optical crack gauges, gauges or tell tales. 
6.1.5.2	
Reasons for occurance of cracks
Cracks may occur due to creep, shrinkage, fatigue, fire, non-functioning of bearing, temperature 
gradient, chlorination and carbonation. It may also be caused by plastic settlement, plastic 
shrinkage, early thermal contraction, long-term drying shrinkage, crazing, corrosion of

reinforcement and alkali-aggregate reaction. Repair of cracks becomes necessary when:
	
–	
Corrosion protection/cover is at risk allowing corrosive agents to reach the 
reinforcing steel.
	
–	
The strength, stability and safety of the structure is at risk.
	
–	
A restoration of the tensile strength of the member is structurally necessary, 
e.g. reduction of the stress range in pre-stressing elements through cracked 
coupling joints.
	
–	
Cracks in longitudinal direction of the reinforcement present a risk to bond 
strength/spalling; and
	
–	
A crack free appearance is required from aesthetic as well as lack of safety.
It is always desirable to attempt repairs to cracks at as early a stage as possible.
Basically, a crack resulting from one time load application and which has ceased to propagate 
can be repaired by pressure injection with epoxy/ resins such that stability is restored and any 
adverse influence on the life expectancy of the structure is eliminated or minimized.
6.1.5.3	
Materials
The material used for crack repair must be such as to penetrate easily into the crack and also 
provide a durable adhesion to the crack surfaces. The adhesion strength the interface of the 
material and the crack surfaces should be such as not to allow infiltration of water and to resist 
all physical and chemical attacks. The following materials are used for crack injection:
	
–	
Epoxy/Resin (EP)
	
–	
Polyurethane Resin (PUR)
	
–	
Cement Slurry (CG)
	
–	
Micro fine Cement Suspension (CS)
Selection of Injection Systems is based on the crack being treated. A reckoner on the type of 
injection material to be used is given in below Table 6.1.

Fig. 6.1: Figure showing crack widths and materials that can be used to inject them
Although cement paste is relatively inexpensive, its use is limited to crack widths around 0.3 mm 
Improvement of workability will be obtained if the cement suspension is introduced into the mix 
with high speed mixers.
6.1.5.4	
Repair techniques
The repair techniques generally applicable for the various types of damages and cracking of 
concrete are as follows
	
i)	
Active Cracks: Caulking, jacketing, stitching, stressing, injection etc.
	
ii)	
Dormant Cracks: caulking, coatings, dry pack, grouting, jacketing, concrete 
replacement, pneumatically applied mortar, thin re-surfacing.
	
iii)	
Crazing: coatings, pneumatically applied mortar.
	
iv)	
Alkali Aggregate Reaction: concrete replacement, total replacement
	
v)	
Holes & Honeycombing: total replacement, combing pneumatically applied 
mortar, pre-packed concrete, replacement, injection.
	
vi)	
Cavitation: pneumatically applied mortar, concrete replacement, jacketing (may 
be inside/surface) injection grouting.
	
vii)	
Excessive Permeability: coatings, jacketing, pneumatically applied mortar, 
prepacked concrete, total replacement, grouting.
6.1.5.5	
Injection process
As a rule, the following steps are necessary during injection:
	
–	
Drilling of the injection-holes and blowing out of the holes and cracks,
	
–	
Installation of packers,



======================================================================

–	
Tamping of surface in the area of the cracks to be injected,
	
–	
Mixing of the injection material and 
	
–	
Re-injection and testing.
(i)	
Packer
Packers are auxiliary means by which the injection material is filled into the crack. Depending 
on the method of installation, they may be classified as an adhesive packer and drilling packer.
Adhesive packers are pasted into the crack. The hose to the injection device is connected to the 
nozzle of the adhesive packer. In the case of drilling packers, holes are drilled in the plane of the 
crack or may be inclined to the crack plane. The packer consists of a threaded metal tube which 
is encased in a rubber like sleeve and equipped with a nut. After insertion into the drill hole, the 
rubber sleeve is compressed by screwing down the nut. In this manner, the drill hole is sealed. 
A nipple, equipped with a ball valve to which the injection hose is attached, is screwed into the 
packer opening. The valve opens itself when subjected to the injection pressure. Fig. 6.2 shows 
various types of packers in practice as below.

(ii)	
Injection Equipments
Injection equipments are differentiated as one-component or two-component equipments. In 
the case of one-component equipment, the resin is mixed first and subsequently injected into 
the crack. Typical representative one-component equipments are a hand grease gun, treadle 
press, air-pressure tank, high-pressure tank and a hose pump. With these equipments, rather 
high pressures can be applied. However, the influence of the applied pressure on the packer, 
the tamping and the crack itself should be considered. The pot lift of the material is an important 
parameter in the application of one-component equipments. Therefore, the length of crack that 
can be injected is subject to the volume of material being used and its pot life.
In the case of two-component equipments, resin and hardener are separately transported to 
the mixing head by means of fully automatic dispensing equipment. Therefore, pot life is only of 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
49
secondary importance. Errors in mixing two-component resins can have significant effect on the 
hardening of the resin. Therefore, the use of pre-packaged batches prepared by the manufacturer 
is recommended. Generally, in the case of two-component automatic dosing devices errors will 
not be discovered in sufficient time to apply corrective measures. Fig. 6.3 below figure shows 
various types of Injection equipments in practice.
Fig. 6.3 Injection equipments
(iii)	
Injection
Injection pressure depends on various parameters such as tensile strength of concrete, depth 
and width of crack, viscosity of injection material. The penetration speed of the injection resin 
does not increase proportionately with increasing pressure. The viscosity of the resin strongly 
influences the rate of injection, especially for small crack widths and in the case of the crack 
depth.
The injection of a crack is completed when either the resin or hardener has been consumed from 
either of the containers or a back pressure has built in such a manner that no further material can 
be injected into the crack. The injection has deemed to have been completed when the packer 
refuses to take further material into it.
The injection of all types of materials shall be carried out by and experienced and trained 
applicator. 
(iv)	
Testing: The usual testing methods are core drilling and ultrasonic testing. 
	
(a)	
Coring
	
	
The success of an injection operation can be ascertained by a relatively simple 
procedure of removing cores taken through the crack plane. Because of the 
unavoidable damage to the structural element such evaluations should only be 
used in exceptional cases.

(b)	
Ultrasonic Testing
	
	
With ultrasonic measuring, the efficiently of the grouting operation can only be 
evaluated when the propagation of sound is oriented approximately normal to 
the crack surface.
6.1.5.6	
Recommendations for Practical Implementations
Adequate materials, equipment and experience of the operating personnel are an essential 
requirement for the successful injection of cracks. Appropriate certification is necessary to 
determine the qualifications of operating personnel.
A system of quality control of the resin should be implemented to guarantee a consistent quality 
for each new application. These are the determination of the infrared composition (IR-Spectrum), 
the pot life, the viscosity, the density, the glass transition temperature as well as the development 
of the tensile strength during hardening and the hardened material. To avoid such expensive 
routine controls, some resin manufacturers have contracted with independent institutions to 
provide testing on a statistical sampling basis as a monitoring control. After successful testing, 
the resin batches are provided with a stamp of the testing institute as well as with information 
regarding durability. Stringent regulation for the use of resins in crack repair, especially where 
they must resists tensile stresses, is required to ensure the behavior of structural elements 
and to avoid additional damage that might be caused by the utilization of inadequate materials 
and procedures. Studies have shown that injection with epoxy/resins can be successfully 
accomplished.
A reduction of adhesive strength will occur when the concrete surface of a crack is excessively 
moist. There is also a risk of reduction in the quality of epoxy resins when they are used for the repair 
of structural elements at extreme temperatures. Current experience indicates that epoxy resins 
can be successfully utilized when the temperature of the structural element is not less than 8°C. 
Because of the lack of experience with other resin (e.g. PUR) the 8°C limit should be maintained.
For relatively hot structural elements, as compared to normal temperatures, a considerable 
reduction in the workability time of the resins may result. In these cases, the temperature of the 
structural element, in relation to its influence on the pot life should considerand pretesting may 
be appropriate.
In many cases, only one side of the structural element to be injected is economically accessible. 
Experience has shown that one-side injection of a through crack in a large structural element or 
deep cracks are not always uniformly filled.
An effective epoxy resin injection can still be accomplished when there is a cyclic width variation, 
as result of traffic loading, during injection and hardening, provided this variation does not exceed 
0.05mm. Appropriate traffic limitations upto maximum of the first three days depending on 
temperature should be implemented if larger cyclic crack width variations are anticipated. In the 
case of large crack width, variations resulting from temperature injection should be co-ordinate 
such that hardening commences at maximum crack width opening. Thus, the filled crack will be 
subjected to a compressive stress, atleast for temperature variations. Experience indicates that 
there is no difference in behavior between an alkaline or carbonated concrete.
That deformability of the resin, as a rule, is not sufficient to close active cracks tightly and 
durably in case these movements cannot be stopped. Under these circumstances the feasibility 
of expanding the crack and forming a permanent expansion joint should be explored.

6.1.5.7	
Other Crack Repair Methods
The other methods for repair of cracks are as below:
(i)	
Stitching
Stitching across the cracks by in-situ reinforced concrete is done either along the cracks or a 
series of bands around the members. Reinforcement is placed across the cracks in suitable 
grooves which are suitably packed with non shrink concrete. Alternatively, if geometry permits, 
bars grouted in holes could be used for stitching.
(ii)	
Jacketing
This involves fastening of external material over the concrete to provide the required performance 
characteristics and restoring the structural value. The jacketing materials are secured to concrete 
by means of bolts and shear connector, bolts adhesives or by bond with existing concrete. Plate 
bonding using steel or composite fibre laminates are commonly used. Cementitious jacketing 
with micro concrete or concrete mixed with fibres is also used.
6.1.6	
Pre-stressed concrete members
For PSC members, the simple methods adopted are sealing and coating to fill out the cracks, 
grouting of cracks, repairing corrosion locations, and vacuum grouting using specially formulated 
resins to fill voids in the ducts. Some of the latest techniques include use of special chemical 
material formulations to satisfy the requirements like high tensile strength, special thermal 
properties etc. Some of the methods are common to those for RCC and the relevant details 
given earlier may be referred.
6.1.7	
Corrosion protection of steel reinforcement
6.1.7.1	
General
The embedment of reinforcing steel in concrete normally provides adequate corrosion protection 
due to the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the steel. Because of its alkalinity, concrete 
forms a passivating film on the surface of the encapsulated steel as a result of the presence of 
a saturated lime solution in the cement gel. Moist concrete typically has a pH value in excess 
of 12 which maintains the passivating film. This film is however de-passivated when the pH 
level is reduced below a value of approximately 10 to 11, or when a sufficiently high chloride 
concentration of about 0.4% chloride by weight of cement is present.
In case the alkaline passivation film is destroyed or carbonation has reached the reinforcement 
or if moisture and oxygen are present, corrosion of the reinforcement will occur. In the absence of 
moisture (i.e., dry concrete) the corrosion process is inhibited, even if the concrete is carbonated, 
the alternate wetting and drying cycles increase corrosion.
When reinforcement corrodes to a certain extent, the surrounding concrete cover tends to expand 
and leads to crack and spall or split. The cracks are caused by internally bursting stresses 
developing in the concrete as a result of a net increase in volume by the formation of corrosion 
products. Cracking/Spalling of the concrete cover will then permit the entry of water and other 
corrosion accelerating agents and the rate of corrosion accelerates. Non-expansive black rust 
associated with severe pitting and rapid corrosion can occur in low oxygen wet high chloride 
conditions in salted bridge decks, substructure and marine structures.

6.1.7.2	
Protection of reinforcing steel
(i)	
Preparation prior to protection
The decision on the necessity or removal of chloride contaminated concrete cover shall depend 
upon the amount of chloride content, availability of moisture and degree of carbonation. This 
decision requires a case by case evaluation. If the corrosion protection of the reinforcing steel 
requires removal, the reinforcement will have to be exposed completely.
The removal of rust from the uncovered reinforcing steel is generally accomplished by mechanical 
methods and hydro jetting or needle hammer and wire brushing. The removal of rust from the 
remote side of the bar is a difficult operation. A careful check and a repeated treatment of the 
individual bars is essential.
(ii)	
Restoration of the protection
This is similar to surface protection.
All exposed reinforcement cleaned to bare metal should be protected immediately after preparation 
by using suitable corrosion inhibiting active or barrier coatings. These are proprietary materials 
to be used to provide corrosion resistance to the cleaned reinforcement, prior to application 
of the polymer modified mortar/concrete system. The materials that can be used to provide 
corrosion protection include:
Active coatings for reinforcement: Arc coatings, which contain Portland cement or 
electrochemically active pigments, which may function as inhibitors or which may provide 
localized cathodic protection. Portland cement is considered to be an active pigment due to its 
high alkalinity. Typical product that can be used is a one-component polymer modified mineral 
based corrosion protection coat, which can be used for most repair applications. 
Barrier coatings: Arc coatings, which isolate the reinforcement from pore water in the surrounding 
cementitious matrix. Typical product that can be used is a two component Epoxy Resin based 
Zinc Rich Primer and Coating Material for use in repairs subject to aggressive environmental 
and chemical attacks. 
(iii)	
Preventive corrosion protection
In the case where concrete cover is thin it may be desirable to seal the surface with an epoxy/ 
resin and solvent containing acrylic resins to prevent carbonation or corrosion. 
(iv)	
Cathodic protection
The Cathodic Protection (CP) technique has been adopted to protect steel pipe lines and tanks 
from corrosion. In recent years it has been applied experimentally for the protection of reinforcing 
steel in concrete.
Corrosion of steel in concrete proceeds by the formation of an electro-chemical cell with the concrete 
acting as coupling electrolyte, an anodic reaction occurs at some points on the steel surface and 
cathodic reactions consume the dissolve electrons on the remaining portion of the steel surface.
The presence of chloride ions will produce a local de-passivation. By means of an externally 
applied small Direct Current (DC) the electric potential between the steel and concrete is shifted to 
a non-critical level. Thus, the electrons impressed in the steel forces the steel to act as a cathode 



======================================================================


IRC:SP:40-2019
53
in the electro-chemical cell. The potential shift produced by the DC is critical to the cathodic 
protection. Because of the high resistivity of the electrolyte concrete a uniform distribution of the 
protection current throughout the structure is necessary. But difficulties in achieving this and high 
costs have prevented cathodic protection being widely used in bridge decks and superstructures. 
However, research continues. 
It is accepted that there is still research required to be done before cathodic protection can be 
safely applied to pre-stressing steel. 
6.1.8	
Pre-stressing steel protection
6.1.8.1	
General
This section deals only with the repairs to pre-stressed reinforcement. It should, however be 
noted that the repair of the concrete and the normal reinforcement of a pre-stressed concrete 
structure will also require attention. In most cases, the pre-stressing force is still active and the 
stresses transferred to the concrete must be carefully considered, especially when repairing 
concrete in the anchorage zones.
6.1.8.2	
Repair of the corrosion protection system for bonded tendons
In the case of bonded tendons, the pre-stressing steel should be protected by the concrete cover 
and the cement grout in the ducts.
(i)	
Vacuum Procedure
Where the ducts are not completely filled with cement grout, subsequent grouting is necessary. 
This can be accomplished by vacuum grouting techniques. The advantage of this procedure is 
that the re-grouting of a duct requires only one drilled hole for each void. Such holes may be 
pre-existing in the form of the drilled holes used for tendon inspection or for obtaining samples 
for chloride content evaluation. Only a diameter adjustment may be required. A comparison 
between the assessed volume of the void and the amount of grout consumed will provide a 
control measure as to the success of the operation. Where discrepancies occur further additional 
borings will be required. A carful drilling procedure is required to avoid damaging of the pre-
stressing steel. Special devices and techniques have been developed for this purpose, such 
as: slow drilling speed: special drill head, small impact force, drilling without flushing, sucking 
away of drill dust and automatic switch off when the drill bit reaches the duct. The repair must be 
accomplished as quickly as possible after opening of the duct to avoid corrosion.
After grouting, a pressure has to be applied to expel residual air from the voids. There is a risk 
that for large air cushions, setting water will be displaced towards defects and produce paths 
which will impair the corrosion protection. Therefore, mortar having slow setting characteristics 
should be used. Special cements are available for this purpose.
In special cases, surplus water in the duct can be evacuated. However, this process requires 
special equipment and knowledge.
(ii)	
Grouting of the Ducts with Special Resins
Where ducts filled with water cannot be drained through drilling or the vacuum process and 
drying is not possible, the water can be displaced by use of special resins with a long pot life and

6.1.8.3	
Repair of corrosion protection systems for external tendons
The pre-stressing steel of external tendons is protected by a tight envelope of plastic pipe or 
painted steel pipe and the internal void of the pipe is filled with cement grout or suitable greases. 
If an inspection indicates deterioration of the protection system, measures must be taken for its 
re-establishment. Such measures may be re-painting of steel ducts and protective caps over 
the anchorages, replacing of plastic pipes, taping of local pipe damage, filling of voids inside the 
pipes etc.
Any materials used in the repair procedure must be compatible with the existing protection 
materials and with the pre-stressing steel. Some paintings, coating materials and special grouting 
mortars might contain substances that can produce stress corrosion and should, therefore not 
be used.
6.1.9	
Honeycombed concrete
There are two methods of repairing i.e. either the porous parts of the concrete are replaced by 
sound, watertight concrete or the porous zones are injected with a sealing material. First, all 
the porous zones of the structure must be carefully removed. Then they are replaced by fully 
compacted concrete or mortar with a water/cement ratio not exceeding 0.4. This procedure cannot 
be used where there is a continuing inflow of water. In this case, sealing can be accomplished by 
injection or use of underwater epoxy/resins
6.1.10	
Repairs to damages/disintegrated/crushed components
Depending on the extent and severity of damaged concrete may be rectified with the partial or full 
replacement either by higher grade of concrete, polymer modified or fiber reinforced concrete. 
6.2

Various combinations of these materials.
	
–	
Steel Plate bonding
	
–	
Fiber Reinforced Plastic bonding
The main problem associated in strengthening is to achieve compatibility and continuity in 
the structural behaviour between the original material/structure and the new material/repaired 
structure also:
	
i.	
The strengthening part of the structure participates only under live load and
	
ii.	
The strengthening part of the structure participates under live and dead load (or 
a part of it)
It may be noted that these strengthening measures improve the strength but not necessarily the 
durability of the original structure.
6.2.3	
Design aspects
The strengthening of structures should be designed and constructed in accordance with related 
codes. If special codes for strengthening exist, they will of course be of assistance to the designer 
and contractors. However, this is seldom the case, and many problems in connection with 
strengthening are not dealt with in the codes. Typical problems of this kind are the transfer of shear 
forces between the old concrete and the new concrete applied for strengthening reinforcement 
and the post-tensioning of the existing structure which in some respects is different from the 
post-tensioning of a new structure etc.
6.2.4	
Interaction between new and old concrete
Satisfactory interaction/ bonding between existing concrete and new concrete is required in case 
of strengthening and repairs. As a rule, the aim is to get the structural parts, composed of different 
concretes, to act as a single unit similar to that of homogeneously cast structural component. 
To achieve this, the joint between old concrete and the new concrete should have requisite 
bond strength and must be capable of transferring tensile and shear stresses without relative 
movements of such a magnitude that the static behaviour is significantly affected. Furthermore, 
the joint must be durable i.e., the composite structural component must not change its mode of 
action with time in existing/ changed environment. 
While replacing large concrete volumes, the possibility of additional stresses as a result of heat 
of hydration has to be taken into account. Temperature differences can be limited by special 
measures, either, pre-heating of the old structural element and/or cooling of the fresh concrete.
Differences in creep and shrinkage properties between old and new structural elements will 
require careful evaluation. Cracks may develop as a result of potential increases in constraint 
forces. Therefore, it becomes necessary to correctly detail and anchor the reinforcement. 
To implement the strengthening measure, it will be necessary to employ suitable mortars or 
concretes with low creep and shrinkage properties as well as minimal development of hydration 
heat. At the same time, an effort should be made to match, as closely as possible, the strength 
and modulus of elasticity of the new material with that of old material. These requirements will be 
influenced to a large extent by the composition and treatment of the new material.
Vibrations due to traffic during hardening of the new concrete will have either negative influences 
or positive influences on its strength and its bond characteristics to the old concrete. This will 
depend on whether the vibrations are just sufficient to harden the concrete or too severe to 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
56
disturb the components of hardened concrete and its bond. Traffic shall be permitted only after 
complete setting/hardening of fresh material. In case it is observed that vibrations do not have 
any negative influence then the traffic could be permitted in a controlled manner while the repairs 
are in progress. However, if the vibrations due to traffic have negative influence then stoppage 
of traffic or speed limits may have to be considered during the hardening phase as necessary. 
The critical phase may be 3 to 14 hours after making the concrete. The form work should be so 
detailed that no relative movement occurs between old and new concrete. The reinforcement 
has to be sufficiently fastened so as to keep relative displacement small.
6.2.5	
Strengthening of the reinforcement
The strengthening of reinforcement can be achieved by:
	
–	
Replacing of corroded reinforcement;
	
–	
Providing additional reinforcement;
	
	
* placed in the old cross section;
	
	
* placed in an additional concrete layer;
	
–	
Pre-stressing and
	
– 	
Bonded steel/ fiber plates.
6.2.5.1	
Strengthening with reinforcing bars
In the simplest case, a strengthening of the concrete tension zone is possible by the addition 
of reinforcing steel. Reinforcement should be added after reducing locked up stresses to the 
extent possible and after the concrete cover has been removed or after recesses have been cut 
in the cover to accommodate the added reinforcement. Afterwards the concrete cover must be 
re-established. An effective anchoring of the ends of the reinforcing steel is required. This can 
either be done by providing sufficient anchorage length for the steel in the concrete, or by steel 
plates and bolts with anchoring discs.
The severely damaged reinforcing bars must be replaced. After unloading of the structure, the 
damaged sections of the corroded bar can be removed and the new reinforcing bar joined to the 
ends of the old ones by lapped splices, welding, or coupling devices. Transverse reinforcement 
is needed to assure a ductile behavior of the splice.
Staggering of lapped splices is recommended unless the c/c distance between the bars is greater 
than twelve times the diameter of the bars.
Lapped splices in a structural element can produce problems (congestion, interference with the 
proper compaction of concrete etc.) These difficulties may be overcome by the use of welded 
splices or couplers.
6.2.5.2	
Strengthening by means of bonded steel/fiber plates
The strengthening of concrete structures can be achieved by means of bonded plates. A behavior 
of these systems needs to address following aspects:
Short-Term Behavior
The load carrying capacity of this type of strengthening depends on the strength of the 
reinforcement, the concrete and the adhesive. At yielding of the reinforcement the adhesive will 
fail. Utilization of high strength reinforcement is limited by the dimensions, concrete strength, etc.

Concrete strength has a large influence on the efficiency of the strengthening.
Theoretically, higher bond stress is to be expected from an increase in the elasticity of the 
reinforcing element and a decrease in the elasticity of the adhesive.
Geometrical influences are primarily the dimension of the reinforcing elements. Their length, 
thickness and widths are decisive. The length of these elements has an influence on the bond 
stress intensity, which decrease with length. 
The bond stress will at the same time be influenced by the thickness. Therefore, glued on 
reinforcing elements behave differently from deformed bars which can be designed using 
the same permissible bond stress for all diameter. There is no proportionality between the 
width of the glued element and ultimate load, as an increase of width results in a reduction 
of bond strength. For a certain ratio of width to thickness the glued surface becomes a 
minimum.
With increasing width, there is a risk of defects in the adhesive. Therefore, the width of the 
reinforcing element should be limited to a maximum of 200 mm.
The thickness of the adhesive coat, within a range of 0.5 to 5 mm, has no significant influence 
on ultimate load. With increasing thickness of adhesive the slip between the reinforcing element 
and the concrete becomes greater. The concrete dimensions, according to previous test, do not 
appear to have any decisive effect. The surface condition of the steel is an important parameter. 
Suitable conditions can be achieved by sand blasting or by suitable method. Oil and grease 
should be removed by means of an organic solvent. As cleaned surfaces may corrode rapidly, 
a primer coating should be applied immediately. The primer serves as a corrosion protection 
and as an adhesive base for resin adhesive. It is a specially formulated solvent containing 
epoxy resin. Priming with zinc dust or hot-dip galvanizing is not suitable for glued on reinforcing 
elements.
The strengthening of concrete structures can be achieved by means of bonded plates.
Working principle of this system was plate-bonding technique, which was used. When the 
steel plate is bonded to concrete with epoxy adhesive the structural behaves will be composite 
structure. Three systems are commonly used:
	
i)	
Steel Plate Bonding
	
ii)	
GFRP/CFRP Bonding
	
iii)	
Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix
Steel Plate Bonding
It is an efficient method of increasing flexural capacity in beams, when applied on tension side; 
the success depends upon the epoxy adhesive, which transfers load from concrete to steel. It is 
constructability that was reason for major success, as well as plate bonding does not increase 
the section. Disadvantages were cutting of steel plates to suit the geometry, its weight and 
problem of corrosion.
Fiber Reinforced Plastic Bonding
This is in fact an extension of the steel plate bonding technique with tremendous advantage of 
light weight, ease of cutting and mouldability to suit any element and high chemicals resistance.

Two systems commonly used are based on Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP), and Carbon 
Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP)
FRP composites contain fibers of high tensile strength in polymer matrix of epoxy or vinyl ester. 
The rapid acceptance of this material is due to serviceability and ease of application without 
disturbing the structure. Fiber wrapping of columns provides passive confinement with increase 
of ductility and strength. Shear strengths are also increased. Wrapping gives excellent protection 
against explosions. FRP plates can be bonded with epoxies to increase flexural strengths. The 
limitation is the use of epoxy, which can change its characteristics during thermal variation and 
fire.
Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Matrix
This material system is similar to the CFRP Strengthening system, with only the matrix being a 
cementitious material, instead of an epoxy. This system addresses many of the shortcomings of 
the CFRP system. Some of these advantages include:
	
i)	
Fire resistant – Up to Class A like for the concrete and mortar.
	
ii)	
The system undergoes ductile failure (like steel reinforced concrete) and not 
brittle failure as in CFRP.
	
iii)	
The system is Moisture/humidity resistant, no minimum substrate moisture 
content requirements.
	
iv)	
The system is High temperature resistant unlike CFRP.
	
v)	
The performance of the composite is similar to CFRP System.
	
vi)	
Environmental friendly technology – Helps reduce the concrete and cement 
consumption.
	
vii)	
Design guidelines for the systems are available in ACI 549, similar to ACI440 for 
the FRP.
	
viii)	 The system is an easy technology, fast application – Once the concrete is 
repaired and restored to the original geometry, the FRCM system can be applied 
only after one day.
For the pre-treatment of the concrete surface, the procedures discussed earlier apply. Blasting 
with fine grained blasting materials has proved to be effective (minimum pull-off strength 1.5N/
mm2). Coarse grained blasting materials will achieve a deeper roughening of the concrete surface, 
which results in an increased consumption of adhesive, but not necessarily in an improvement 
of bond strength.
(i)	
Long-Term Behavior
The question of long term behavior is of particular importance for these materials, the properties 
of which are highly time-dependent, of considerable importance are: creep, ageing and having 
fatigue strength.
(ii)	
Creep
The creep of resin adhesives is considerably greater than for concrete. In accordance with the 
current state-of-the-art, it can be assumed that the creep deformation abates relatively quickly. 
The adhesives may have very different creep ratios. In thin adhesive layers upto 3 mm the 
influence of creep is restricted by the cohesion of the adhesive.

IRC:SP:40-2019

(iii)	
Ageing
Ageing is a change of properties resulting from mechanical, physical and chemical influence’s; 
e.g., air humidity, radiation, heat, weathering and water over period of time. Ageing varies widely 
between various adhesives. For strengthening of metal elements, ageing reduces strength 
such that the long-term strength is only approximately 50% of the short-term strength. For 
strengthening of concrete, a more favorable relationship exists, as the adhesive coating will be 
loaded considerably less.
Epoxy resin/adhesive have a certain porosity, which will allow the penetration of water and 
other solutions. Exposure to water over long periods of time can cause resin/ adhesives to lose 
strength. Water sensitivity varies widely between various adhesives.
(iv)	
Fatigue Strength
The fatigue strength is approximately 50% of the short-term strength. This indicates that 
concrete with glued on reinforcement shows a more favorable behavior than those for glued 
metal structures, for which the dynamic strength for 10 millions load cycles is only 10% of the 
static strength. After a dynamic load has been applied, the static ultimate strength of the concrete 
structure with glued on reinforcement increases. This can be explained through a reduction of 
the bond stress speaks as a result of dynamic load.
(v)	
Behavior at Failure
The slip between the reinforcing element and concrete under tensile load has an approximately 
linear elastic behavior upto about half of the element and the adhesive layer. A further increase 
in the load leads to a progressive increase of the relative displacement. The elastic deformations 
results from the deformation of the adhesive layer. This slip starts at the loaded end of the 
reinforcing element and moves, with increasing load, to the centre of the element. In the plastic 
range, a slip deformation in the concrete sub-surface also occurs. The slip in the concrete develops 
some millimeters below the adhesive coat. A failure occurs suddenly, by abrupt elongation of the 
slip interface upto the end of the reinforcing element.
In correctly designed structures with bonded plate reinforcement, a ductile failure with yielding 
reinforcement can be attained. Bolting on plates to prevent pealing failures is now normally 
accepted in some countries. It should however, be kept in mind that strengthening with steel 
plates with epoxy is a very workmanship sensitive method and so operations have to be under 
expert guidance only.
6.2.6	
Strengthening with external pre-stressing
6.2.6.1	
General
In many cases, strengthening by means of external pre-stressing is a highly effective method. 
Both reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete structures can be strengthened by this 
method. The influence of the external pre-stressing on serviceability and ultimate limit states 
can be varied within wide limits by selecting different methods of introducing the tensioning force 
and using different profiles of the tendon.
6.2.6.2	
Choice of system for external pre-stressing
For external pre-stressing, only post-tensioning systems have been developed. For normal 
applications in pre-stressed concrete, post-tensioning systems should comply with the 



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
60
requirements of the IRC codes for Acceptance and Applications of Post-Tensioning Systems. 
Both bonded and un-bonded tens can be used. If short pre-stressing elements are required, a 
post-tensioning system with minimal slipping in the anchorage (anchor set) should be chosen. 
Short pre-stressing elements can be sensitive to deviations due to construction tolerances 
(eccentricity, inclination and tolerance of the anchorage elements, the pre-stressing jacks, etc.)
The use of lower strength high ductility threaded bars for partial pre-stressed could be considered 
as a more robust, simple and durable approach to avoid the very high local anchorage loads and 
durability problems with pre-stressing tendons.
At deviation points (saddles) excessively small radii of curvature in the tendon should be avoided.
6.2.6.3	
Special design consideration
The strengthening by means of external pre-stressing can normally be designed as an ordinary 
pre-stressed member. While calculating pre-stress losses, however, it should be noted that the 
effect of creep and shrinkage may generally be less than in normal design, due to the age of the 
old concrete. The stress in an unbounded tendon in the ultimate state will be only slightly larger 
than that after pre-stress losses.
6.2.6.4	
Protection against corrosion and fire
The post-tensioning tendons should be protected against corrosion and fire to the same extent 
as in a newly built structure. The requirements for concrete cover are the same as for ordinary 
pre-stressed concrete structures.
6.2.6.5	
Anchorages and deviators
Since the external pre-stressing tendons are not embedded in the structure in the conventional 
manner special attention must be given as to how the force is introduced. The space requirements 
of the anchorage and the pre-stressing device should be taken into consideration. When 
strengthening an existing structure, it is not generally possible to provide spalling or bursting 
reinforcement behind the anchorages in the same manner as for a pre-stressed concrete 
structure. Spalling can be prevented by means of transverse pre-stressing. This pre-stressing 
has the further function of creating contact pressure between new and original concrete, such 
that the necessary shear stresses can be transferred through the joint. To ensure full interaction 
between the tendons and the rest of the structure, the same method can be used along the 
entire beam. But the required shear stress is often so small that it can be dealt with by means of 
non-tensioned reinforcement. Another method could be to locate the anchorages in compressive 
zone and design the anchor plates for a suitably reduced bearing stress. There are several 
methods available for the attachment of supplementary pre-stressing as mentioned below:
	
i)	
Anchorage at girder ends 
	
ii)	
Additional supports, either in concrete or steel, fixed to the web of the box girder. 
This method provides a good distribution for the force in the external tendons, 
but creates high stresses locally where the pre-stressing force is introduced. 
Because of the very short transverse dowels the fixation of the tendon supports 
or brackets can be a problem.
	
iii)	
Anchorages at existing diaphragms require extensive coring such that the 
tendon can pass through the diaphragm and be anchored at the backside. If 
the diaphragm does not have sufficient capacity to transmit the pre-stressing

force, it may be necessary to provide a structural steel frame to transfer the 
longitudinal pre-stressing force.
	
iv)	
Deviators or deviation saddles 
Where a draped profile is used, deviation saddles or deflectors have to be provided to achieve 
the profile. These devices can be either concrete or steel. They are attached to the existing webs 
or flanges by short pre-stressing bolts or other type of anchors. These short bolts or dowels are 
very sensitive to anchorage seating losses. A large radius of tendon curvature should be used.

6.2.7	
Strengthening with prefabricated reinforced concrete or precast concrete elements 
Strengthening is also possible by adding precast elements. This method will require a distressing 
(unloading) of the original section. The composite cross section of precast elements and the 
original concrete is then re-stressed (loaded). This provides an improved transmission of pre-
stress force throughout the composite section. With time a re-distribution of permanent load will 
occur as a result of creep and shrinkage.
This strengthening method requires bond between the two structural elements at their interface. 
As a rule, a resin modified cement bond mortar layer is utilized.
For treatment of the contact surface of the structure, the same operations as described earlier 
are necessary.
In the fabrication of the precast elements, consideration should be given to the texture of the 
contact surface so as to provide increased bonding and shear characteristics at the interface. 
A sufficiently rough surface of the precast element can be obtained when the formwork of the 
contact surface is treated with a retarder. By early removal of the formwork and cleaning with 
water, a washed concrete surface can be achieved. A reduction of the largest grain size in the 
concrete on this surface is beneficial. Sufficient curing prevents micro-cracks between mortar 
and aggregates resulting from shrinkage. To roughen the surface, sand blasting is also suitable.
If no special measures are taken during fabrication, the contact surfaces of the precast elements 
have to be treated like that of the original structure.
6.2.8	
Strengthening by imposed deformation
By means of imposed deformation, overstressed sections of a structure can be partially relieved. 
With this the load carrying capacity of the whole structure is improved. A self-equilibrated stress 
condition can be induced in the structure by relative displacement (raising and/or lowering) of the 
supports or by the introduction of new intermediate supports.
It is important to note that relieving some sections of the structure will increase action effects 
(bending moment, shear, torsion etc) in other sections. A strengthening of these sections may 
be required. Another important factor is time: relative settlement of the supports, shrinkage and 
creep of the old structure and the new supporting elements will influence the distribution of the 
actions- effects in the structure.
6.2.9	
Strengthening by other methods
Concrete slabs or beams or columns (piers) can be strengthened by providing reinforced 
concrete jackets or overlays. Normally, thickness of new concrete layer should be less than 
about 1/3rd of the thickness of existing concrete. Proper attention to bonding and detailing of 
shear connections needs to be given.
Replacement of structural system or additions of new system to the existing structure are also 
sometimes adopted to rehabilitate or strengthen a structure. In such cases, the existing internal 
stresses in the members must be carefully analyzed.
Structural alterations could also be considered to reduce excessive vibrations.

CHAPTER 7 
REPAIRS TO EXPANSION JOINTS AND BEARINGS
7.1	
Introduction
Operational life of expansion joints, bearings, footpaths and railings is usually shorter than that 
of the bridge. The expansion joints, bearings, railings, parapets etc. need special attention for 
repairs and replacements or renewal. The capacity and efficiency of bearings may be a limiting 
factor in situations where it is required to increase the load carrying capacity of a bridge.
7.2	
Expansion Joints
The expansion joints are not expected to last throughout the life of the bridge. It is, therefore, 
necessary that joints be replaced on a regular cycle. Based on the experience gained in India 
as well as in other countries, it may be reasonable to assume life of expansion joints around 20 
years. Stipulations in IRC:SP:69 for replacement of joints shall be adhered to. The seals of the 
joints usually serve for 10 to 12 years with normal maintenance and may need replacement over 
a period of time. Some of the factors which would influence replacement are as under:
	
	
Damage to seals such as tearing, loosening, cracking or displacement.
	
	
Damage to other components
	
	
Clogging of joints.
	
	
Loosening of anchor plates.
	
	
Damage to concrete near the joints leading to their malfunctioning.
	
	
Leakage of water through the joints.
	
	
Theft of the joints.
Early bridge stock was provided with joints such as angle and plate, copper or asphaltic or finger 
type joints. Many of these joints may need replacement for better functioning of the /bridge deck 
if not function properly or deteriorated. Replacement is warranted with elastomeric or modular 
joints.
It is vital to keep the joints watertight in order to prevent the ill-effects of moisture including 
corrosion on the beam ends, bearing shelves and substructure. Leaks must not be tolerated. It 
is not uncommon for joints to be watertight under the roadway but allow water to leak through at 
the kerb. Any replacement of joint shall be watertight and it shall be complete and full width of 
deck which includes carriageway, kerb, footpath and central verge.
Where water tight joints cannot be provided, adequate means of draining the water passing 
through the joints shall be provided. As far as possible, the water should be kept out of contact 
with the concrete and the bearings. This is sometimes difficult to realise. If these measures fail, 
regular maintenance of the bearings and pedestals will at least prevent water from damaging 
the concrete. Joints may be filled with a sealant or filler. The filler material must be designed to 
ensure water tightness. Debris may prevent joint movement if the filler fails and may damage the 
joint sides or joint material, it may spall the sides of jointed slabs or cause over-stress in other 
bridge elements. Debris also tends to retain moisture and hence contribute to the deterioration 
of adjacent bridge component.
Damage to finger type joints can manifest in the form of bent, cracked, corroded, broken, 
closure of gaps and jamming. Reasons can be due to traffic or movement of bituminous wearing

65
course, poor alignment and loose anchorages. The fingers may also cave in or project up due 
to unacceptable deformation of the deck or differential settlement of foundation. Cracking and 
spalling of the pavement or deck in the area adjacent to the joint may cause subsequent failure 
of the joint by loosening the joint side support material. Joints can also get closed in balanced 
cantilever type bridges due to excessive deflection of cantilever or excessive hogging of main 
span.
Movement of abutment must also be considered when inspecting joints. Such movement may 
either increase or decrease the joint opening or may even close the joint opening completely, 
preventing free expansion of the bridge.
All damaged joints should be replaced. The sealant filler shall be replaced periodically. Cracked 
concrete in the zone of anchoring the joints shall be replaced. Periodic cleaning and removal of 
debris is a must.
Table 5.2 may be referred to for defects and possible replacement.
7.3	
Bearings:
Bearings are vital elements of the bridge and need regular inspection and maintenance. Bearings 
may be affected/distressed due to:
	
–	
Manufacture, defective materials
	
–	
Inadequate design
	
–	
Inadequate or improper installation
	
–	
Negligent maintenance
The type of defect may be one or more of the following:
	
–	
Corrosion
	
–	
Defective seal in neoprene/ pot bearings
	
–	
Broken guides
	
–	
Cracked or broken rollers, plates
	
–	
Cracks, splits or tears in neoprene material,
	
–	
Accumulation of dirt/ debris at the bearing point
	
–	
Failure of anchorage system
	
–	
Movement or creep of parts out of place
	
–	
Partial contact of bearing plates
	
–	
Excessive tilt or even shift
The bearings in distress may need replacement or resetting under the following circumstances:
	
–	
Excessive tilting or collapse of cut rollers
	
–	
Displacement of rollers
	
–	
Shearing off of lugs
	
–	
Shearing off of rag bolts
	
–	
Corrosion of rollers and plates

Appropriate corrective action shall be taken after detailed investigation of the defects. Repair or 
replacement of bearings requires traffic restrictions or even temporary suspension of traffic.
Excessive tilts in bearings like segmental bearings should be corrected in time. This can be done 
by lifting the superstructure, shifting the bottom or top plates and lowering the superstructure. 
The cracked or excessively deformed elastomeric bearings shall be replaced. This requires lifting 
of the superstructure. Lifting is normally done with hydraulic/special jacks. Where superstructure 
is very heavy, cranes may have to be used. In all events of lifting, checking the design of 
superstructure for stresses induced due to lifting is obligatory. These specialized activities shall 
only be undertaken by specialist agencies. Table 5.2 may be referred to for defects and possible 
replacement.

CHAPTER 8 
HYDRAULIC ASPECTS
8.1	
This chapter has been introduced mainly to focus attention of the bridge engineers on 
this major cause of frequent damages to bridges. Fairly good knowledge about hydrology and 
geotechnical situation is now available. Nevertheless solutions to hydraulic problems cannot be 
generalized. Unique solutions on case to case basis will have to be evolved. Some of the most 
common hydraulic deficiencies which could occur are as under:
	
(a)	
Actual discharge in excess of that assumed in the design
	
(b)	
Substantial increase in velocity of the river/ stream from that for which it was 
designed.
	
(c)	
Increase in scour depth from the one adopted in design of foundations resulting 
in settlement of one or more foundations of the bridge.
	
(d)	
Damage to the piers of the bridge due to the impact of floating debris brought by 
the stream during floods.
	
(e)	
Oblique flow of the stream under the bridges, the angle of obliquity being more 
than that assumed in the design.
	
(f)	
Meandering of the river and flow concentration in few spans may adversely 
affect stability of bridge.
	
(g)	
If actual waterway provided is inadequate, river may overflow the banks or may 
cut across the approach road behind the abutments.
	
(h)	
Location of the bridge is on curvilinear portion of the river. In high floods, abutment 
and penultimate pier on convex portion may get adversely affected.
The causes for occurrence of these and other similar deficiencies have to be explored, examined 
and thereafter suitable remedial/ rehabilitation measures may be adopted so as to ensure safety 
and serviceability of the bridge structure.
Some of the remedial measures adopted commonly for hydraulic problems are given below:
8.2	
A bridge structure can substantially get damaged by floods. There are cases where 
rehabilitation of bridges becomes necessary on account of changes in the hydraulic parameters 
as manifest during flood conditions. The damages can be caused due to (i) abnormal floods, (ii) 
normal floods, if the design of the bridge does not cater adequately to the normal design floods 
and/ or (iii) as in a few cases, due to man-made changes in catchments of watercourse, e.g. the 
flood levels may exceed the original design levels substantially back water effect of a storage 
constructed downstream requiring raising of the bridge superstructure.
8.3	
Floods can damage the bridge structure as well as the approaches and the protective 
measures. The bridge engineer is advised to refer to IRC:89 “Guidelines for Design and 
Construction of River Training and Control Works for Road Bridges”
8.4	
If either due to inadequacy of original hydraulic design or due to the requirements 
of traffic as in a submersible bridge, the bridge level has to be raised, the same can be done 
by raising the superstructure with the help of jacks and extending the sub-structure in suitable 
stages by successfully resting them on the precast concrete pads which can then be embedded

in the raised height of the piers. Where, however, the bridge deck is not to be raised but the 
bridge has to be protected from floods higher than the design floods, then designing the bridge 
as a submersible one and strengthening the same may have to be explored. At the same time 
suitable corrective measures may have to be adopted for decking and approaches, like provision 
of air-vents between the girders, protection of embankment, strengthening of piers by jacketing 
etc.
8.5	
When the velocity and consequentially calculated scour in the stream is expected to 
increase and the substructure is found to be unsafe under such conditions, a solution of paving 
the bed with suitable aprons upstream and downstream can be considered to prevent the scour 
around the piers and the piers may also be strengthened by jacketing. 
8.6	
If flood damages to the bridge and approaches are of frequent nature then after 
careful investigations it may be necessary to extend the length of the bridge to provide adequate 
waterway. If the floods attack one side of the bridge, then additional spans could be provided 
on the affected side. Sometimes such situation can be handled by adequately designed spurs 
or groynes. In some cases, the returns beyond the abutments get damaged and may require 
replacement by returns on deeper foundations. Where a pier gets damaged beyond repairs, the 
span lengths could be changed either by locating a pier in between or if possible, by doubling 
the spans with suitable strengthening of the remaining substructure.
8.7	
Bed protection can get damaged due to excessive turbulent floods or disturbance of 
stone protection. Surfaces of concrete or masonry can get eroded by high velocity of stream and 
sometimes cavitation can occur.
8.8	
The bridge hydraulics is a highly specialized subject and so the treatment of the 
damages must be designed and carried out in consultation with a specialist. Use of hydraulic 
model studies for specific problems is also of considerable help in arriving at a proper solution.

CHAPTER 9 
MONITORING
9.1	
Necessity
Once rehabilitation and strengthening of the bridge is completed, it is essential that the structure 
is inspected periodically and its condition monitored regularly. This would help in assessing the 
performance of the work done. It would also bring out any further distresses that may occur. The 
various methods of monitoring the bridge structures are given in the succeeding paragraphs.
9.2	
Methods of Monitoring
During the distressed stage of a bridge and after the distressed bridge has been repaired, 
rehabilitated or strengthened, it is necessary to carefully monitor its behavior for a certain period 
of time to ascertain its performance and the efficacy of the measures adopted. The monitoring 
would involve carrying out certain laboratory and field tests as well as condition surveys and 
measurements to detect strains, movements, changes in reaction and deformations.
9.2.1	
Inspections
The first and the foremost requirements is to carry out routine inspections at more intervals 
than the normal structures, say immediately after distress is noticed and on completion of the 
remedial measures and during the use of the structure at the frequency of 6 months to one year 
depending upon the type of bridge and nature of distress thereafter for a period of 3 or 5 years. 
Use of mobile inspection units should be made wherever needed. The techniques of underwater 
inspection described earlier may also be adopted.
9.2.2	
Changes in behaviour
The usual methods adopted for monitoring the behaviour of a structure are:
	
a)	
Observing deflections by periodically taking levels. The movements of bridges 
can be measured at the joints using slide gauges for maximum /minimum 
movements and reference pins for routine check.
	
b)	
Visual observations for cracks, deflections, overall integrity, profile, functioning 
of bearings and hinges, corrosion stains. Particular note must be made of the 
cracking pattern, their width and length and whether cracks can be due to plastic 
shrinkage, settlements, structural deficiency, reactive aggregates, and corrosion. 
Signs of delamination, spalling, hollow or dead sound when tapped with hammer, 
honeycombing` and expansion of concrete should also be observed and levels 
of inspections have to be specified depending on individual cases.
	
c)	
The change in the width of the cracks with the passage of time needs to be 
observed through tell-tales and gauges to know whether the cracks are active 
or passive.
	
d)	
Plumb bobs are used to measure deviation from verticality for vertical members: 
Special tilt meters or inclinometers also could be used; (NB: Datum readings at 
the time of construction are essential).
	
e)	
Opening of joints, particularly near the hinges, expansion joints etc. need to be 
observed.
	
f)	
Redistribution of support reactions may also be measured in some cases.

9.2.3	
Corrosion monitoring
The use of permanent electrodes for accurate measurement of the corrosion potential of steel 
in concrete is also made. Use of current density or rebar probes and the use of corrosion 
rate monitoring probes can be made to meet the particular requirements. Careful selection of 
permanent monitoring equipment is required. The locations should be minimum and should be 
at the area of most active corrosion rate.
Relatively thin steel wires are embedded in the structure near the reinforcement with permanent 
electrical connections to the tell-tales so that electrical resistance can be measured. Corrosion 
of tell-tales would cause an increase in the electrical resistance. Certain devices can be 
permanently embedded in the concrete for facility of later measurements of the extent and the 
rate of corrosion in future years. 
9.2.4	
Strain measurement
The measurement of strains at critical sections or joints is another method of monitoring the 
behaviour of critical bridge elements. Electronic strain gauges are fixed at predetermined points. 
9.2.5	
Use of lasers
Application of lasers in structural monitoring is finding increasing use in developed countries. 
In its simplest form the system consists of threading a laser beam through series of apertures 
in the plates fixed along the length of the beam, say along the soffit a girder or soffits or series 
of adjoining girders, (Fig 9.1). Similarly, a laser beam can also be directed vertically along the 
bearings or a column. The beam after passing through a series of apertures in plates thus fixed 
along this path reaches the light sensitive receivers at the farthest end. The failure of the beam 
in reaching the receiver requires further investigation because it could be due to some structural 
deformations of the members supporting the plates or due to some other reasons. A system of 
series of such laser beams can be provided in a structure and arrangement made to sound an 
alarm in case of blockage of light of any laser beam.
Further refinement of the system could be made by attaching detectors to the structure along the 
path of the laser beam whereby any movement of the structure at the location of each detector 
would be continuously tracked by the latter relative to the laser beam and the actual overall 
behaviors of the structure at each detector location can be measured, recorded and analyses with 
the help of computers controlling timing and the operational sequence of the various detectors. 
Readings to the accuracy of even 0.1 mm are possible and continuous& constant 24 hours-a-
day monitoring of a structure for its integrity and soundness is possible.

71
Measurements for vibration characteristics of a structure can also be adopted in some cases to 
monitor the continued structural integrity and strength in the long run. However, a specialist’s 
guidance should always be obtained.
9.3	
Instrumentation
Instrumentation has to be provided for proper monitoring of long spans well as state of the art 
bridges to study their behaviour during their service life. The measurement may include concrete 
strain at critical points, temperature effects, defections, movement of hinges, etc.
9.4	
Training
Monitoring of distressed bridges as well as rehabilitated bridges requires a great deal of skill and 
specialization. The engineers maintaining and inspecting such bridges therefore will need to be 
trained for such jobs.
9.5	
Data Management
Monitoring also requires setting up a data bank as a reference frame. This should be initiated at 
the time of construction.
Testing, measurements and analysis of data are important to monitor the condition of the bridges. 
The sampling frequency of testing, therefore, has to be decided with the help of an expert. In the 
beginning, an extensive random sampling could be adopted to study the variability of results. 
Later, after studying the variability of the results limited target sampling may be decided. Both 
in selecting the sample size and the interpretation of the results, expert guidance is absolutely 
essential.
Monitoring shall also be augmented by continuous research and development. The details of the 
areas of research and development are enclosed as Appendix-II

CHAPTER 10 
MISCELLANEOUS ASPECTS
10.1	
There are certain important aspects of rehabilitation and strengthening of bridges 
involving measures other than technical which deserve due attention at various stages by 
concerned authorities. These are:
	
–	
Effective control of traffic and traffic restrictions, both in terms of speed as well 
as load, till the repairs are completed.
	
–	
It is advisable to put up warning and cautionary boards about the speed of 
vehicles and weight restriction on the vehicles if applicable to any bridge after 
repairs/strengthening on both ends of the bridge.
	
–	
Contingency plan for diversion of traffic and other necessary actions in case of 
any mishap.
	
–	
Providing proper information to public through publicity and press and countering 
any ill-founded rumours.
	
–	
Sometimes public-interest litigations also crop up which have to be handled 
properly.
	
–	
Safety precautions.
	
–	
Last but not the least, the morale of the engineers in charge of the work has to 
be maintained since they would be carrying out such repairs at a great risk to 
their own safety.
10.2	
After completion of every job of rehabilitation of a bridge, an engineer must prepare 
a document to enable drawing lessons for the future so as to improve the bridge technology. 
Provision must be made in structures at the design stage itself for the possibility of future 
interventions like maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, strengthening and replacement of some 
components etc. A number of fruitful lessons can be learnt from the adverse experiences on the 
bridges and the consequent improvement of bridge technology.
10.3	
Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation of State of the Art bridges like suspension, 
cable stayed, extradosed bridges etc. shall be carried out on the basis of specialized literature 
and expert opinion on the basis of advanced data collection method/techniques supplemented 
detailed quantitative analysis.
10.4	
The new materials and techniques shall be used for Maintenance, Repair, Rehabilitation 
and strengthening with utmost care and due diligence with respect to the specifications, method 
of application and quality control promoter in addition to the respective IRC codes/guidelines.

Appendix-I
TESTING METHODS
The various testing methods for assessment of the bridges are described below. Although brief 
procedure is also provided it for background information and for detailed procedure corresponding 
latest code as mentioned in Table 4.1 shall be referred.
1.	
CARBONATION TEST
Use to determine the depth of the carbonated layer on the surface of hardened concrete by 
means of an indicator. 
The Carbonation of concrete on the surface results in loss of alkaline protection of the cover 
over the steel against corrosion. Carbonation of concrete occurs when the carbon dioxide, in 
the atmosphere in the presence of moisture, reacts with hydrated cement compounds. The 
carbonation process is also called depassivation. When an indicator is sprayed on the surface 
which is freshly exposed and the indicator turns the colour, it indicates the presence of carbonates 
and hence carbonation. 
The depth of carbonation is measured by spraying on the freshly broken surface of concrete with 
0.10% solution of phenolphthalein.
The 1% phenolphthalein solution is made by dissolving 1gm of phenolphthalein in 90 cc of 
ethanol. The solution is then made up to 100 cc by adding distilled water. On freshly extracted 
cores the core is sprayed with phenolphthalein solution, the depth of the uncoloured layer (the 
carbonated layer) from the external surface is measured to the nearest mm at 4 or 8 positions, 
and the average taken. If the test is to be done in a drilled hole, the dust is first removed from the 
hole using an air brush and again the depth of the uncoloured layer measured at 4 or 8 positions 
and the average taken. The concrete undergoes, a colour change (from pink to colourless) when 
PH value is below 10. If the concrete still retains its alkaline characteristic, the colour of the 
concrete will change to purple/ pink. If carbonation has taken place the pH will have changed to 
7 (i.e. neutral condition) and there will be no colour change.
If there is a need to physically measure the extent of carbonation it can be determined easily by 
spraying a freshly exposed surface of the concrete with a 1% phenolphthalein solution in 70 % 
ethyl alcohol. No specific equipment is required. 
The measurement of carbonation depth using the phenolphthalein solution can be carried out 
by spraying the indicator on the split surface of the concrete cylinder or core dust sample. The 
solution became a pink colour in the un-carbonated concrete and can be differentiated from the 
carbonated concrete, giving a distinct boundary marking the carbonation front. A carbonation 
depth up to an accuracy of 5 mm can be identified with the naked eye. 
It directly gives the effective cover available to the reinforcement before the start of corrosion. 
Factors affecting the test results are:
	
i.	
Humidity- Higher humidity results in greater carbonation process. Ideally, 
50-70% lower humidity means not enough water available for carbonation. 
	
ii.	
Temperature - The carbonation reaction rate increases with temperature. 
	
iii.	
Low Rain Precipitation- When the concrete surface is wetted by rain, the diffusion 



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
76
of CO2 is momentarily blocked as the pores get filled with water. The diffusion of 
CO2 will continue once the concrete starts drying. Carbonation is then expected 
to be more severe in those regions with low precipitation and particularly on 
those parts of the structures that remain sheltered from the rain.
	
iv.	
High Concentration of CO2 - The normal concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere 
is approximately 0.03%. However, in certain areas as in bridges with heavy 
traffic, or close to industrial areas, the level of CO2 contamination may reach and 
even exceed 0.1 % concentration.
The method is simple, fast and accurate and no equipment is necessary. The contour maps of 
the surface of the concrete member having varying carbonation depths can be prepared to get 
some insight to the durability aspects of the structure. 
The tests results do not assist in determination of concrete durability directly. Minor surface 
damage shall occur and if not treated it may be the source of reduced cover to the reinforcement. 
This technique is mostly used for assessment of the surface carbonation of reinforced concrete 
members to determine the possibility of corrosion and hence establish the durability of the 
section. 
There may exist a partially carbonated zone, where the pH value is not easily detected by 
phenolphthalein indicator. The carbon dioxide could react at the depths greater than those 
indicated by the indicator. The test shall not be considered as a tool for estimating the structural 
properties of the reinforced concrete member.
2.	
SULPHATE CONTENT
To determine the sulphate content through the concrete samples.
The concrete attached by sulphate has a characteristic white appearance. 
The quantity of sulphate is estimated by the precipitation of barium-sulphate and sulphate 
confined by identification of Calcium Sulpho Aluminate. Weigh into a 400 ml beaker 5 ± 0.005 g 
of the analytical or sieved sample. Disperse with 50 ml of water and add 10 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid. Add 50 ml of hot water, cover the beaker and boil the solution gently for 
5 min to 10 min. Filter through a medium ash less filter paper. Wash the residue thoroughly 
with hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1+49). Add three drops of the methyl red indicator and heat 
the filtrate to boiling. Just neutralize to yellow with the dilute ammonium hydroxide solution. 
Immediately add 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then add drop wise to the boiling 
solution 10 ml of the barium chloride solution. If excess ammonium hydroxide was added, 1 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid may not be sufficient to obtain the required acid solution and 
the barium sulphate precipitate will then be contaminated. In this case the test shall be repeated. 
Boil gently for 5 min, keep the solution at just below boiling for 30 min and allow to stand at room 
temperature for 12 hrs. to 24 hrs. Filter through a slow ashless filter paper and wash free from 
chlorides with hot water. Transfer the paper and contents to a weighed silica or platinum crucible 
and burn off the paper without flaming. Ignite the precipitate at 800 ºC to 900 ºC until constant 
mass is achieved.
The sulphate content G, expressed as SO3, as a percentage of the cement to the nearest 0.1 % 
(m/m) from the expression

ii.	
Exposure to Atmospheric carbon dioxide.
The samples from other NDT tests like core cutting, pull out can also be used.
3.	
CHLORIDE CONTENT
To determine the Chloride content in the concrete.
Salts of thiocyanates and thiosulphates are increasingly used as accelerating admixtures in 
place of chlorides. These compounds can interfere with the determination of chloride content.
The Chloride content in concrete is measured in laboratory by Mohr’s method using potassium 
Chromate as indicator in a neutral medium or by using Volhard’s volumetric titration method in 
acidic medium.
Weigh into a stoppered 500 ml conical flask 5 ± 0.005 g of the analytical or aggregate separated 
sample. Disperse with 50 ml of water and add 10 ml of nitric acid. Add 50 ml of hot water, boil for 4 
min to 5 min and keep warm for 10 min to 15 min. Cool to room temperature and add a measured 
excess of the silver nitrate standard solution. Add 2 ml to 3 ml of 3.5.5 - trimethylhexanol stopper 
the flask and shake vigorously to coagulate the precipitate. Add 1 ml of iron I II indicator solution 
and titrate with the thiocyanate solution to the first permanent red colour.
Chloride content will be determined, the presence of acid soluble chlorides in concrete beyond 
the permissible limits is considered as a corrosion hazard in concrete structures.

Rapid tests for in-situ chloride determination are being developed.

evolved due to high variability of laboratory test results.
4. 
SCHMIDT/REBOUND HAMMER TEST
It is used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in an existing structure and as a 
quality control measure of a new construction.
It works on the principle that the rebound of an elastic mass depends on the hardness of the 
surface against which the mass impinges. 
The equipment used for the test is called Schmidt Rebound Hammer which is shown in the 
Fig. A1. The main components of the equipment include the outer body, the plunger, the hammer 
mass, and the main spring. While testing a concrete surface, the plunger is held perpendicular 
to the concrete surface and the body is pushed towards the concrete. This movement extends 
the spring holding the mass to the body. When the maximum extension of the spring is reached, 
a latch located in the equipment releases, and the mass is pulled towards the surface by the 
spring. The mass hits the shoulder of the plunger rod and rebounds because the rod is pushed 
hard against the concrete. During rebound the slide indicator travels with the hammer mass and 
stops at the maximum distance the mass reaches after rebounding. It is essential to calibrate the 
equipment by testing the same on an anvil supplied with the equipment.

Rebound hammer test data are recorded in terms of rebound numbers. Generally, up to 10 
readings are taken on a square grid from a test location and the average of readings is calculated. 
It indicates the average surface hardness of concrete at a given location.
Each hammer is furnished with correlation curves developed by the manufacturer using standard 
cube specimens to convert the average rebound number into the compressive strength. However, 
the use of such curves is not recommended because the material and testing conditions may not 
be similar to those encountered in the field / laboratory.
Typically the correlation between the rebound number and the strength of the concrete is carried 
out as given below:
For an existing structure:
	
a)	
A minimum of 3-5 concrete cores preferably of size 150 mm Ø x 300 mm or 100 
mm Ø x 200 mm are extracted from different locations of the structure
	
b)	
The cores are conditions as specified in IS 516. After capping, cores are placed 
in a compression-testing machine under an initial load of approximately 15% of 
the ultimate load to restrain the specimen. 
	
c)	
About 15 hammer rebound readings are taken, 5 on each of 3 vertical lines 120° 
apart, against the side surface in the middle two thirds of each core. Testing the 
same spot twice shall be avoided, and average is calculated.
	
d)	
The cores are then tested in a UTM to determine the concrete compressive 
strength.
	
e)	
The core compressive strength is converted into the cube compressive strength 
by multiplying the core strength by 1.25, as suggested in IS: 516
	
f)	
The rebound numbers are plotted against the compressive strengths on a graph
	
g)	
A correlation is then developed between the average rebound numbers and 
the core compressive strength by fitting a curve or a line by the method of least 
squares.
This correlation may be used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in the structure 
at different locations from average rebound hammer.
For quality control purposes of under-construction structure:
	
a)	
About 30 concrete cubes of 150 mm size are made using the same mix 
proportions to be employed for the construction. 
	
b)	
The specimen are cured under standard moist-curing room conditions, keeping 
the curing period the same as the specified control age in the field.
	
c)	
The cubes are placed in a compression-testing machine under an initial load of 
approximately 15% of the ultimate load to restrain the specimen. 
	
d)	
About 16 hammer rebound readings are taken, 4 on each of sides, avoiding 
testing the same spot twice, and average is calculated.
	
e)	
The rebound numbers are plotted against the compressive strengths on a 
graph.

f)	
A correlation is then developed between the average rebound numbers and the 
cube compressive strength by fitting a curve or a line by the method of least 
squares.
This correlation may be used to estimate the compressive strength of concrete in the structure 
at different locations, from average rebound hammer, at the specified age, to monitor the quality 
in the construction.
Factors affecting the test results are
Rebound number may be affected by (i) Smoothness of the test surface, (ii) Size, shape and 
rigidity of the specimen, (iii) Age of the specimen, (iv) Surface and internal moisture conditions 
of concrete, (v) Type of coarse aggregate, (vi) Type of Cement (vii) Carbonation of the concrete 
surface etc. Carbonated surfaces generally give higher rebound number readings, upto about 
50% for a carbonation depth of 20 mm, (viii) the angle of striking the concrete and (ix) type of 
mold.
This allows survey to produce contour maps of the surface of the concrete member having 
varying rebound numbers.
The method is simple, fast and accurate and the instrument used is very handy.
The method gives only the surface hardness but does not give direct estimation of compressive 
strength. A correlation curve, specific to the concrete in the structure, is required to be developed 
to correlate the rebound number to compressive concrete strength.
Coefficients of variation for compressive strength for a wide variety of specimens average at 
19 % and exceeded 30% for some groups of specimens, and the same can be narrowed down 
considerably by developing a proper correlation curve for the hammer, which allows for various 
variables discussed earlier. The depth of influence of the test extends up to about 20 mm from 
surface. The probable accuracy of estimation of concrete strength in a structure is ±25%, however 
for properly cast, cured concrete specimen, and tested under laboratory conditions by a properly 
calibrated hammer, an accuracy of ±15 and ±20% can be achieved.
Commercial rebound hammers with analog or digital display of the readings are available. Some 
of the recent equipments display the averagebound number.
5.	
COVER METER
Cover Meters are used to detect steel reinforcement bars and estimate concrete cover over 
rebar and diameter of the steel reinforcement bar in concrete structures.
The method works on electro-magnetic principles. An electromagnetic field is generated by the 
search head of the meter. When a reinforcing bar or other magnetic metal object lies within this 
field, the lines of force become distorted. The disturbance caused by the presence of the metal 
in turn produces a local change in field strength as detected by the search head and indicated 
by the meter. 
Cover meters operating by monitoring two different effects of electromagnetism are available; 
eddy current effect or magnetic induction effect. Eddy current method works at higher frequencies 
(> 1 kHz) and is sensitive to any conducting material in the vicinity of the search head, while 



======================================================================
PAGE 89 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
81
the magnetic induction method used low frequency current (below 90 Hz) and is less sensitive 
to non-magnetic metal. In both the methods, the proximity and orientation of the metal to the 
search head affect the meter reading.
Portable battery operated commercial cover meters (also called pachometers) are widely 
available. Cover meters capable of locating stainless steel bars are also available. 
An application of typical cover meter is shown in the Fig. A2.
Fig. A2 Cover Meter in Use
It is possible to obtain the location of reinforcing steel bar, determine the depth of concrete cover 
and estimate the barsize using the cover meters.
Cover-meters can measure the cover with an accuracy of 5 mm up to a depth of about 75 mm.
Factors affecting the test results are: Measurements may be affected due to (i) Potential loss of 
accuracy, (ii) Type, orientation of steel, multiple bar, closely spaced bars and tie wire, (iii) Magnetic 
properties of aggregates & surface finish, (iv) Temperature and (v) Corrosion of reinforcement.
The technique is the least complicated and least expensive of all the NDT techniques. Under the 
most favourable site conditions, indicated cover can be measured to an accuracy or + 1 to 4 mm 
approaching that obtainable in the laboratory when the bar size is known.
The various limitations are:(i) It is a slow and labour intensive method. (ii) The level of accuracy 
may vary with congested reinforcement and severity of corrosion (iii) The equipment needs to 
be calibrated before use (iv) The equipment may not work if non-magnetic reinforcement such 
as galvanised bars or FRP bars are used in the structure. 
6.	
GROUND PENETRATING RADAR
A high frequency pulsed radar can be used to detect any metallic or non-metallic objects, 
deterioration like delamination and the other types of defects, which can occur in bare or overlaid 
reinforced concrete decks. It can also measures thickness of components.
The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is shown in the Fig. A3. It is the electromagnetic analogue 
of sonic and ultrasonic pulse echo methods. It is based on the propagation of electromagnetic 
energy through materials of different dielectric constants. The greater the difference between 



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
82
dielectric constants at an interface between two materials, the greater the amount of 
electromagnetic energy reflected at the interface. Schematic view of Ground Penetrating Radar 
Technique is shown in Fig. A4.
A permanent record can be stored on magnetic tape and the unit is normally mounted on a 
vehicle and the data are collected as the vehicle moves slowly across the deck.
GPR can be used for locating the reinforcement, embedded cables and ducts in a bridge 
structure, and to determine the thickness of different layers of the structure. It is also used for 
profiling the bottom of lakes and rivers, and measuring scouring around bridge foundations etc.

======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
83
The test results may be affected due to metallic objects such as cars, telephone line and clustering 
of rebars below scanned surface could result in total reflection of incidence wave resulting in 
restriction in depth of analysis.
Since radar yields information on the structural profile across the depth of the object being 
tested, it is at present the only commercially available non-destructive method for the inspection 
of concrete bridge decks that have asphalt overlays. 
GPR is still reliant on the experience of the operator. The radar waves can never penetrate 
through metals, so testing the interior of metal ducts, e.g. for un-grouted areas is not possible.
Ground radar surveys are used on bridge structures for assisting load assessments and as a 
follow-up to routine inspections. A GPR survey is able to locate internal defects for the accurate 
targeting of intrusive investigations. On masonry arch structures, locate defects and identify 
backing on the haunches of the arch.
A large number of commercial equipments available, hand held and tailor made to reach all 
locations and detect any structural discrepancies.
Radar may fail to locate small delaminated areas, especially those that are only 0.3 m wide or 
less, because the strong reflections from the rebars tend to cover reflections from delamination.
8.	
RADIOGRAPHY
Radiography techniques are applied on the pre-stressing cables to detect defects in the cable 
and to examine the quality of grouts within the ducts. Radiography is also used to locate the 
position of reinforcement bar in reinforced concrete, estimates can be made of bar diameter 
& depth below the surface, to determine presence of voids, cracks and foreign materials, and 
variations in the density of the concrete.
The amount of radiation lost depends on the quality of radiation, the density of the material and 
the thickness traversed. The beam of radiation, which emerges from the material, is usually 
used to expose a radiation sensitive film so that different intensities of radiation are revealed as 
different densities on the film.
The Principle of Radiography is shown in Fig. A5.
Fig. A5 Principle of Radiography



======================================================================
PAGE 92 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
84
Most of the applications involve transmission of wave energy rather than reflection or refraction 
methods. The emerging radiation is detected by photographic emulsion or by a radiation detector. 
The former is called radiography and the latter radiometry. In short the procedure is as below: 
X ray tube used to produce X-rays, which is the basic requirements, namely (i) source of electrons 
as a heated filament, (ii) means of directing and accelerating the electrons as a high voltage 
supply, and (iii) target which the electrons can bombard, normally in the form of heavy metal 
target. 
The Tube (Fig. A6) consisting of a glass envelope in which two electrodes are fitted, a cathode 
and an anode. The cathode serves as a source of electrons. Applying a high voltage across the 
cathode and the anode first accelerates the electrons, and then stopping them suddenly with a 
solid target fitted in the anode. Stopping the fast moving electrons results in the generation of 
X-rays. The back-scatter techniques is based on intensity of X-rays can be used to detect the 
voids in grouts and testing strands or wires which are broken or are out of position.
Fig. A6 A typical X-ray tube
A radioactive isotope source produces radiation by electron or nuclear energy transitions usually 
of a single energy or a few discrete energies. Isotope sources emit photons continuously and do 
not require electrical power. 
The specimen absorbs radiation but where it is thin or where there is a void, less absorption 
takes place. Since more radiation passes through the specimen in the thin or void areas, the 
corresponding areas of the film are darker.
The relationship between the intensity of photons incident and transmitted is:
I = I0e(–µx)
where, I is transmitted photon intensity, I0 is incident photon intensity, μ is attenuation coefficient 
and x is thickness of object.
Factors affecting the test results are: The penetrating ability of portable X-ray units is limited and 
is used for members less than 300 mm thick. 
Major disadvantage is the health risk associated with the radiation. High degree of skill and 
experience is required for exposure and interpretation. The equipment is relatively expensive. 
The process generally slow and require two-sided access to the component.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
85
Radiography techniques can be used for (i) detecting both surface & internal discontinuities, 
(ii) detecting significant variations in component, (iii) inspecting hidden areas. Permanent test 
record is obtained and good portability especially for gamma-ray sources.
Small amounts of corrosion will not be detected and the technique is suitable only for isolated 
cables without any other obstructions in the path of the wave. The main limitation of radiography 
is that for thick sections, high-energy is required.
9.	
INFRA-RED THERMOGRAPHY
Infra-red thermography is used for the determination of delamination in bridge decks and columns 
exposed directly to sun.
The method works on the principle that discontinuity within the concrete, such as delamination, 
interrupts the heat transfer through concrete. Radiation is incident on the surface and that is 
reflected or absorbed. Absorbed radiation is for the reflected from the sub-surface defect leading 
to local heating. If this radiation falls on a concrete surface, then if the delaminations or the void 
was not there, then lot of radiation will simply get absorbed into the concrete. Whereas, if the 
void or a delamination present within the concrete surface the radiation gets reflected back to 
the concrete surface and a patch which has higher temperature than the neighbouring patches 
obtained. This difference in temperature observed on a concrete surface is used for detecting 
defects within the concrete surface.
In short the procedure is as below:
The equipment can be truck mounted permitting a lane width to be scanned by a single pass. 
The differences in surface temperature are measured by sensitive infrared detection system 
which consist of infrared signal, control unit and display screen. The images get recorded on the 
photographic plates or video tapes. A typical Infrared Thermography camera is shown in Fig. A7.
Fig. A7 Infrared Thermography Camera
Infrared thermography provides a two dimensional image i.e. Thermographs of the test surface 
showing the extent of subsurface anomalies like presence of voids, delaminations and occurrence 
of spalling.
Presence of Voids and occurrence of Spalling can be evaluated with the help of Thermographs.
Factors affecting the test results are: Thermographs may be affected by subsurface configuration, 
surface condition & environment.



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
86
The main advantage of infrared thermography is that it is an area testing technique, while the 
other NDT methods are mostly either point or line testing methods. The concrete need not be 
destroyed during testing. 
The disadvantage of thermography is that while a positive result is valid, a negative result may 
not be always reliable because it relates to results under conditions prevailing at the time of 
tests. Nevertheless, the method itself has a considerable promise as a rapid screening tool for 
determining whether a more detailed investigation is required. The presence of voids or spalling 
can be found out but not the depth.
This technique is mostly used for assessment of the cracks, anomalies and spalling on the 
concrete surface. 
Higher resolution cameras with continuous plots of bridge deck are possible to do a very fast 
analysis of cracks, anomalies and spalling in the deck. 
The range of camera’s available are varied and unless a very high resolution/pixelate camera is 
used, the results may not be accurate and subject to judgment.
10.	
ULTRA SONIC PULSE VELOCITY TEST
It is used for assessment of uniformity/integrity of concrete in structures. It can also be used to 
measure changes occurring with time in the properties of concrete, correlation of pulse velocity 
and strength as a measure of concrete quality. 
The quality of concrete can be assessed by passing through concrete the ultra-sonic pulse and 
measuring its velocity. Measured values may be affected by surface texture, moisture content, 
temperature, specimen size, reinforcement and stress. Measured Time taken by wave to pass 
through the particular medium is empirically correlated to the uniformity or integrity of the concrete 
section. Calculation of ultrasonic pulse velocity taking into account time passing through testing 
base and length of the same as follows: 
T= L / V
In short the procedure is as under:
	
i.	
This test is performed by using a transducer & receiver which are calibrated & 
applied with oil/grease/sticky material on concrete surface where integrity or 
homogeneity is to be measured. This placement can be done in three different 
types i.e. Place the transducer and Receiver on the Opposite face (Direct) or 
Adjacent face (Semi Direct) or on same face (Indirect). 
	
ii.	
When the pulse generated is transmitted into the concrete from the transducer, 
the first waves to reach the receiving transducer are the longitudinal waves, 
which are converted into an electrical signal by transducer. Electronic timing 
circuits enable the transit time T of the pulse to be measured. The methods of 
propagating ultrasonic pulses are given in Fig. A8 below:

Fig. A8 Methods of Propagating Ultrasonic Pulses
The time taken by the signal in order to travel and reach the receiver is the result that will be 
showed on the UPV which is Velocity. 
Evaluation of concrete is done according to the criteria given in IS 13311(Pt. 1).
Based on the test result Quality of Concrete can be categorized based on velocity is as follows: 
(i) V >4.5 km/sec-Excellent, (ii) V = 3.5 to 4.5km/sec –Good, (iii) V = 3.0 to 3.5 km/sec – Medium 
and (iv) V <3.0 km/sec-Doubtful 
The velocity may be affected due to (i) Surface texture, (ii) Moisture content, (iii) Temperature 
of the concrete, (iv) Path length, (v) Reinforcing bars and (vi) Shape & size of the section, water 
cement ratio, hydration, curing, aggregate size of the concrete.
The advantage of this test is that it relates directly to the quality and homogeneity of concrete 
in the structure rather than to samples, which may not be always truly representative of the 
concrete in situ. UPV Testing has the possible solution to judge the porosity, density, strength of 
concrete section provided proper correlations are established. Generalised correlations are not 
suitable to define strength of the concrete sample. 
This technique is mostly used for assessment of the integrity, homogeneity and uniformity of the 
concrete members where there is any ambiguity on the concrete integrity.
Co-relation can are more reliable if both test element and compressive strength test specimens 
are of similar size, consolidated to similar density, cured under similar conditions and has same 
age of concrete. The limitation of the method is that it cannot indicate the actual concrete strength.

ENDOSCOPIC TEST
It is useful in detecting voids in the grouts, concrete, corrosion in steel etc. The test can be 
performed for locating the tendons, evaluating the video images, and taking notes of the findings 
and making decisions regarding to the need for further inspection. This test if required, should 
preferably be done in association with radiography. 
Endoscopy consists of usually flexible viewing tubes which can be inserted into holes drilled in 
the bridge components or into a cable duct of the pre-stressed concrete. A light is provided by 
optical fibres from external source. The endoscopes are available with attachments for a camera 
or a TV Monitor and are used for detailed examination of parts of the bridge structure which 
cannot otherwise be assessed.
A typical inspection team consisted of an inspector that operated the endoscope in the drilled 
hole, and an inspector controlling the video recording equipment (Fig. A9).
Fig. A9 An Endoscope and View
Endoscopies consists of inserting a rigid or flexible viewing tube into holes drilled into concrete 
bridge components or cable ducts and view them with light provided by optical glass fibres from 
an external source.
Areas where tendons contain voids and other flaws can be found out and a written log documenting 
the inspection including the depth and length of voids, conditions of the strands if visible may be 
made.
The test results may be affected due to Humid Environment.
Endoscopy surveys provide a fast, cost effective means of identifying problematic/in-accessible 
areas where bear minimum destruction is allowed for inspection. The endoscope inspection is 
a reliable method for assessing the conditions of the post-tensioning tendons. The method is 
invasive but the damage induced to the tendons and deck is minimal.
It is not possible to assess the conditions of the strands where the voids with water present. 
Flexible endoscope lens is a very delicate and sensitive piece of equipment.
It is also useful for detail examination of other part of the bridge structure, which could not 
otherwise be assessed.
Endoscopes are available as attachments for a camera or a TV monitor.

This method can be used to validate and corroborate the findings of more economical NDT 
procedures.
12.	
ACOUSTIC EMISSION TEST
Test is used to check detect locate and characterise damages faults in structures and its 
components. 
The stresses acting on the material produce the local deformation, which is breakdown of the 
material at specific places. This material breakdown produces acoustic emission i.e. an elastic 
wave that travels outward from the source, moving through the body until it arrives at a remote 
sensor. Acoustic emissions can be detected in frequency ranges under 1 kHz, and have been 
reported at frequencies up to 100 MHz, but most of the released energy is within the 1 kHz to 1 
MHz range. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz, 
and typically falling off at several MHz. Acoustic Emission Testing process is given in Fig. A10 
below:
Fig. A10 Acoustic Emission Testing Process
The Acoustic Emission is based on the detection and conversion of high frequency elastic 
waves to electrical signals. This is accomplished by directly coupling piezoelectric transducers 
on the surface of the structure under test and loading the structure. Sensors are coupled to the 
structure by means of a fluid couplant and are secured with tape, adhesive bonds or magnetic 
hold downs. The output from each piezoelectric sensor (during structure loading) is amplified 
through a low-noise preamplifier, filtered to remove any extraneous noise and further processed 
by suitable electronic equipment. 
AE sources are determined by calculating the difference in time taken for the wave to arrive at 
the different transducers.
The results may be affected due to (i) Geometric spreading, (ii) Scattering at structural boundaries 
and (iii) Absorption
Compared with ultrasonic, radiographic or the other NDT methods, the source of information 
is derived by creating some effect in or on the material by external application of energy or 
compounds. AE relies on energy that is initiated within the component or material under test. 
Acoustic Emission can be used at all stages of testing which include: pre-service (Proof) testing, 
in service (Re-qualification) testing, on-line monitoring of components and system, leak detection 
and location, and in-process weld monitoring. 



======================================================================

Other advantages of the method are: Material anisotropy is good, Less Geometry sensitive, 
Less Intrusive, Global monitoring, Rea-time evaluation, Remote scanning and Performance 
price ratio
Acoustic Emission can be subjected to extraneous noise. For successful applications, signal 
discrimination and noise reduction are crucial. This test is best performed if the loading history 
of a structure is known. 
The instrumentation of Acoustic Emission must provide some measure of the total quantity of 
detected emission for correlation with time and/or load. Acoustic Emission is stress unique and 
each loading is different. The structure under test will attenuate the acoustic stress wave. 
13.	
CORE TEST
Core testing may be used for determination of the compressive strength of concrete.
The basic principle for obtaining strength of core is the ratio of Maximum load applied to the 
Cross-Sectional Area.
The necessary equipments are given in Fig. A11 which consist of: (i) Grinding equipment (ii) 
Steel collar, (iii) Steel plate (this is required before capping when the cores are stored in water at 
20 ± 2ºC) and (iv) Compression testing machine.
 i. Core Cutting Equipment
ii. Core Cutting in the Field
 
iii. Different Types of Drills
iv. Compressive Strength Machine

The standard procedure is briefly given below:
	
i)	
Test the core in compression not less than two days after end preparation and 
immersing in water.

ii)	
Placing the core in the testing machine. Wipe the bearing surfaces of the testing 
machine and of any auxiliary platens clean and remove any water, loose sand 
or other material from the ends of the core.
	
iii)	
Placing the core in the testing machine. Wipe the bearing surfaces of the testing 
machine and of any auxiliary platens clean and remove any water, loose sand 
or other material from the ends of the core.
	
iv)	
Record the maximum load. Normal failures are reasonably symmetrical. Note 
any unusual failures and the appearance of the concrete.
Compressive strength of each core by dividing the maximum load by the cross-sectional area, 
calculated from the average diameter. 
	
1.	
For cores free of reinforcement. Calculate the estimated in-situ cube strength 
from the equation.
	
	
Estimated in-situ cube strength = (D/(1.5+(1/φ)))x measured compressive 
strength of core
	
Where,
	
	
D is 2.5 for cores drilled horizontally (for precast units perpendicular to height 
when cast); or 2.3 for cores drilled vertically (for precast units parallel to height 
when cast).
	
	
A is the length (after end preparation) /diameter ratio
	
2.	
For cores with reinforcement perpendicular to the core axes.
	
(a)	
For cores containing a single bar:
1.0+1.5(φrd/φcl)
	
(b)	
For specimens containing two bars no further apart than the diameter of the 
larger bar
1.0+1.5(∑φrd/φcl)
	
Where,
φr is the diameter of the reinforcement, φc is the diameter of specimen, d is the distance of axis 
of bar from nearer end of specimen, l is the length of the specimen after end preparation by 
grinding or capping.
The presence of reinforcement, cracked or loose caps in cores may affect the strength.
Along with the compressive strength it can also find out the presence of voids & size of voids, 
honeycombing and cracks. This test method is more reliable while comparing other partially 
destructive test and visual inspection to assess concrete uniformity (aggregate distribution & 
compaction). Core samples can be used for petrography or chemical analysis.
Core test is partially destructive, the damage will occur to the structure. On manually controlled 
machines as failures approached the load-indicator pointer will begin to slow down.

Other ‘partially-destructive’ techniques like penetration resistance, pull-out, pull-off, internal 
fracture & break-off methods for assessing strength of surface concrete are generally results in 
less damage & give instant results.
14.	
GALVANO-STATIC PULSE TRANSIENT METHOD
Method is used to determine the instantaneous corrosion rate of reinforcing steel in concrete.
The basic principle is the same as that of LPR method (galvano-static perturbation), however this 
is a transient polarization technique working in the time domain. The small anodic perturbation 
current results in change of reinforcement potential which is recorded by a reference electrode 
(usually located at the centre of the counter electrode) as a function of polarization time. The 
resistance offered by the system to passage of current comprises of an ohmic resistance RΩ 
(resistance from concrete between the surface electrode and the steel bar, the double layer 
capacitance (Cdl) at the surface of the steel, and the charge transfer resistance (Rct). It is the 
latter from which the rate of corrosion is determined. Analysis of the transient response from 
the Galvano-static Pulse Transient method (Fig. A12) allows the resistance and capacitance 
components of the system to be resolved, enabling an accurate corrosion rate to be determined. 
Fig. A12 Galvano-Static Pulse Transient Method
A short time anodic current pulse is impressed to reinforcement galvano-statically (galvano-
static polarization), in anodic direction compared to its free corrosion potential, from a counter 
electrode placed on concrete surface together with a reference electrode. The applied current 
is normally in the range of 5 to 400 µA and the typical pulse duration is up to 10 seconds. 
The reinforcement is polarized in anodic direction compared to its free corrosion potential. The 
resulting change of the electrochemical potential of the reinforcement is recorded by a reference 
electrode (usually in the centre of the counter electrode) as a function of polarization time as 
shown in Fig. A13.

steel) and a corroding steel (active steel).

The data obtained is analysed with the help of a Randels electric circuit and through mathematical 
formulations, the Rct (i.e. Rp) is calculated. The Icorr and icorr are then calculated as detailed in LPR 
test method. Commercially available equipments directly display the icorr when the diameter of 
the bar is fed into the software.
Corrosion current density is obtained from which the corrosion rate can be estimated.
Corrosion rate measurements are affected by various factors such the temperature and humidity, 
a lack of correct electrical contact between the equipment and the reinforcement, a lack of 
correct electrolytic contact between auxiliary sensor and concrete surface and the existence of 
stray currents.
This test is very quick and information about ohmic resistance (RΩ), double layer capacitance 
(Cdl), and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be obtained.
The limitations given with LPR technique also apply to this technique.One specific difficulty 
with the galvanostatic pulse transient technique is that the response to the pulse has to have

stabilized to give an accurate value for Vmax. Curtailing the measurements before an equilibrium 
value for Vmax has been attained may also lead to errors in the evaluation of Rp and Cdl.
Method can be used toassess the present corrosion condition of the reinforcement, that is, to 
discriminate between corroding and non-corroding (passivated) zones. It may also be used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a repair work.

HALF -CELL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS
These are used to determine the corrosion activity of the reinforcing steel in the concrete and 
evaluating susceptibility of rebar corrosion in the given environment concrete matrix.
The electrode (half-cell, Fig. A14b) potential of reinforcement embedded in concrete provides a 
measure of the corrosion risk and indicates whether an electro-chemical reaction is in progress 
on the electrode surface. The electrical potential difference between the reinforcing steel and 
a reference electrode (copper/copper sulphate half-cell or copper calomel electrode or silver 
chloride electrode) is measured. Measured potential difference between the reference electrode 
and the steel rebar is empirically related to the corrosion risk. The measurements are interpreted 
as per ASTM C 876. Commercial equipment based on the above method is available.
In short the procedure is as below:
	
i.	
Spacing Between Measurements-While there is no pre-defined minimum 
spacing between measurements on the surface of the concrete member, it is of 
little value to take two measurements from virtually the same point.
	
ii.	
Make a direct electrical connection to the reinforcing steel by means of a 
compression-type ground clamp, or by brazing or welding a protruding rod.
	
iii.	
Electrically connect one end of the lead wire to the half-cell and the other end of 
this same lead wire to the negative (ground) terminal of the voltmeter.
	
iv.	
Conditioning of concrete by Pre-Wetting of the Concrete Surface-This is 
necessary if the half-cell reading fluctuates with time when it is placed in contact 
with the concrete.

Test measurements may be presented by one or both of two methods. 
	
i.	
The first an equi-potential contour map, provides a graphical delineation of areas 
in the member where corrosion activity may be occurring (Fig. A15).
Fig. A14 Equi-potential Contour Map
	
The second method, the cumulative frequency diagram, provides an comparison of 
affected area of the concrete member based on the magnitude of potential range
The potential risks of corrosion based on potential difference readings are shown the below 
Table  A.T1. Potential difference levels are reference electrode specific and the potential 
difference may be affected due to temperature and moisture content.

The method is simple. It allows an almost non-destructive survey to be made to produce iso-
potential contour maps of the surface of the concrete member. Zones of varying degrees of 
corrosion risk may be identified from these maps.
The half-cell potential measurement does not give any information regarding the rate of 
corrosion. It is often necessary to use other data such as chloride contents, depth of carbonation,

in addition to corrosion potential measurements, to formulate conclusions concerning corrosion 
activity of embedded steel and its probable effect on the service life of a structure. 
Method is mostly to be used for assessment of the durability of reinforced concrete members 
where reinforcement corrosion is suspected.
The difference between two half-cell readings taken at the same location with the same cell 
should not exceed 10 mV when the cell is disconnected and reconnected. The difference 
between two half-cell readings taken at the same location with two different cells should not 
exceed 20 mV. The results obtained by the use of this test method shall not be considered as a 
means for estimating the structural properties of the steel or of the reinforced concrete member.
16. 
HAMMER RAP/HEAVY CHAINS
Hammer/Chains can be used to locate delaminations in concrete bridge decks by sounding 
technique. The test is carried out as per ASTM D 4580-03. 
Chain drag and hammer sounding are generally categorized as crude vibrational modal tests. 
The operator drags chains or strikes a hammer on the deck, listening to the resulting sound. 
A clear ringing sound represents a sound deck while a mute/hollow/dull sound represents a 
delaminated area. The hollow sound is a result of the flexural oscillations of the delaminated 
section of the deck, creating a drum-like effect. Flexural oscillation of a delaminated area is 
typically in a 1 to 3 kHz range i.e. audible range to humans. The perceived delaminated areas 
are outlined on the deck surface.
	
(a)	
Chain Drag – Chain dragging is carried out using a custom-made tool consisting 
of one or more steel chains attached to a handle so that the operator can drag 
or swing the chains as shown in Fig. A15.
Fig. A15: Typical Chains
	
(b)	
Hammer Rapping- Tapping the bridge deck surface with a steel rod or hammer 
is adopted in place of the chain drag particularly onsmall areas and vertical or 
overhead structural elements (Fig. A16).

In addition, electromechanical devices or rotary percussion devices may also be used. Marked 
areas can be mapped on a grid or placed in drawing/mapping software for output as shown in 
Fig. A17. However, no processing of acquired data is needed.
Longitudinal Distance (m)
Fig. A17: Typical Contour Map
Solid concrete will produce a ringing sound, while concrete that is spalled, delaminated, or 
contains voids will produce a flat or hollow sound.
The variable field conditions such as traffic noise, vibration, moisture content of the concrete 
may affect the results.
The method is best suited for slab surfaces where large areas can be tested in a reasonable 
amount of time.
This test method is not applicable on concrete decks overlaid with the bituminous concrete or 
on frozen concrete.
The devices with automatic recorders or automatic marking on the delaminated areas are 
available.
The chain drag technique is less accurate than simple hammer or rod soundings. Although a 
club hammer will locate laminations accurately at depth where the cover to the steel is greater 
than about 40-50 mm, beyond 100 mm concrete sounding can be ineffective in picking up deep 
laminations.

IMPACT-ECHO
This method is primarily used to determine the thickness of concrete slabs, pavements, bridge 
decks, walls, or other plate-like structures, locate poor consolidation, voiding and honeycombing 
in reinforced concrete, detect areas of delamination in concrete, detect de-bonding of an overlay, 
detect degree of grouting in post-tensioning ducts in plain, RCC and pre-stressed concrete 
elements.
The impact-echo technique is based on generating a short-duration, low frequency, stress pulse 
by mechanical impact on a concrete surface. The pulse propagates into the member along 
spherical wave fronts as P and S waves. These waves are reflected by the boundaries of, 
internal interfaces or flaws in, or the opposite face of, the concrete member, and are received 
by receiver or transducer. The time of receipt, or the frequency of the received wave is used to 
estimate the depth of the member, or locate the flaws. 
The equipment for the test method consists of an impact source, a receiver and a data acquisition 
system with appropriate software. Impact sources with shorter-duration impacts (20 to 60 ms), 
such as small steel spheres and spring-loaded spherically tipped impactors are commonly used 
for detecting flaws within slab and wall structures ranging from 0.15 to 1 m thick. However steel 
spheres are convenient impact sources because they produce well-defined pulses (approximately 
a half-cycle sine curves), and the contact time is proportional to the diameter of the sphere.
Conically tipped, piezoelectric displacement transducers are used as the receiver as such 
transducers respond to surface displacement over a broad frequency range. 
The data acquisition system may be a digital waveform analyzer, a portable computer with data 
acquisition hardware and software, or a dedicated impact-echo instruments. 
The velocity of the p-wave generated by the impactor is determined first by impacting on the 
concrete surface where its thickness is already known (Fig. A18 & A19). The velocity is calculated 
by dividing the thickness of the member and the time of the receipt of the pulse. The impactor 
is then struck at different locations on the surface of the concrete member. The depth of the 
delamination, flaw or honeycombing, from the surface is then determined from the time of receipt 
of the pulse and the velocity of the p-wave. Note that it would take lesser time for the wave to travel 
the delamination / flaw / honey combing in the member and return to surface after reflection.

Fig. A19 Illustration of the test method on a concrete surface
The test results may be affected due to:
	
i.	
The velocity of the p-wave depends on the quality of concrete. Hence the velocity 
should be determined for the specific concrete member.
	
ii.	
Contact between the transducer tip and the concrete.
The results are obtained in the form the thickness of the concrete members such as deck slabs, 
beams, walls etc can be determined and homogeneity of the piles.
The presence of delaminations or large horizontal cracks, and voids can be determined. The 
method is not influenced by traffic noise or low frequency structural vibrations set up by normal 
movement of traffic across a structure. The another advantage of this method is that the test 
results are not influenced by weather conditions, or by moisture or chloride in concrete
The contact time (the duration of the Impact) determines the size of the defect that can be 
detected by impact-echo testing. As the contact time decreases and the pulse contains higher-
frequency (shorter-wavelength) components, smaller defects can be detected. In addition, short-
duration impacts are needed to accurately locate shallow defects. Contact with the concrete is 
necessary to perform the test, hence the bituminous wearing course on a bridge deck need to 
be opened at the test location.
Impact-echo is more reliable when relatively small areas are delaminated so as to indicate early 
signs of deterioration.
Commercial equipment on impact echo is available to determine the thickness of the concrete 
bridge deck slabs, plates, pavements etc. Wireless echo system is also available from some 
manufacturers for use of inspection team with limited man-power.
18.	
LINEAR POLARIZATION RESISTANCE (LPR) TECHNIQUE
LPR is used to determine the instantaneous corrosion rate measurement of reinforcing steel in 
concrete.
The method works on the principle that the polarization resistance of a corroding system is 
inversely proportional to its corrosion rate. An induced change (perturbation) in the potential or 
current of a corroding system is called polarization. The polarization resistance is determined 



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:40-2019
100
either by applying a small voltage (10- 20 mV) and measuring the resulting change in current 
at the end of a selected time period, usually between 30 seconds to 5 minutes (potentiostatic 
perturbation), or by applying a small current (up to about 20 mA) and monitoring the resulting 
change in potential (galvanostatic perturbation). It has been shown that the applied voltage and 
the change in current (or vice versa) are linearly related within this small perturbation, and the 
proportionality constant is called linear polarization resistance (LPR).
LPR technique has been shown to be an effective electrochemical method for measuring rate of 
corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete structures.
The polarization resistance, Rp, of the steel is calculated from the equation
Rp=∆E/∆I
Where, ∆E is applied voltage, ∆I is the change in (step) current when the metal is polarized 
(about 20-50 mV).
The corrosion rate, Icorr, is then calculated as follows: 
Icorr=B/Rp
where, B is the Stern–Geary constant, a value of 25 mV has been adopted for active (corroding) 
steel and 50 mV for passive (non-corroding) steel. 
The corrosion current density, icorr, can be calculated if the surface area, A, of Steel is known
icorr = Icorr /A
Portable commercial equipment is available for use at site and in the laboratory (Fig. A20)
Fig. A20 Schematic of the test set up for Linear Polarization Resistance measurement 
In the commercially available equipments, galvanostatic polarization is often employed. In the 
conventional test procedure, a current perturbation to a corroding steel reinforcement is applied 
through an auxiliary electrode placed on the concrete surface (Fig. A20). In the process, the 
surface area of steel that is lying directly beneath the auxiliary electrode is assumed to be 
polarized. However, the current flowing from the auxiliary electrode remains unconfined and 
spreads laterally over an unknown, larger area of steel. Therefore, to confine the applied current, 



======================================================================
PAGE 109 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
101
a guard ring electrode is used which prevents the perturbation current from the auxiliary electrode 
spreading beyond a known area. In order to select an appropriate level for the confinement 
current two sensor electrodes are placed between the inner and outer auxiliary electrodes. The 
potential difference between these sensor electrodes is monitored and a confinement current 
selected to maintain this potential difference throughout the LPR measurement.
Fig. A21 Guard ring test set-up
The equipment directly displays the corrosion current density icorr, when the diameter of the bar 
being tested is fed into the equipment. The actual loss of steel is calculated using Faraday’s laws 
as per ASTM G 102. 
The corrosion potential measurement may be affected due to (i) lack of correct electrical contact 
between the equipment and the reinforcement, (ii) A lack of correct electrolytic contact between 
auxiliary sensor and concrete surface, (iii) The existence of stray currents, (iv) temperature 
and humidity and (v) Flow of current from the auxiliary electrode is unconfined and can spread 
laterally over an unknown larger area of steel, which can affect the results.
It is very suitable for on-site condition assessment of steel reinforcement w.r.t corrosion in 
concrete structures. The instantaneous corrosion rate of steel can be obtained. The method can 
be applied regardless of the thickness of concrete cover and the rebar size or detailing. 
Limitations are: (i)This method assesses only the instantaneous condition of the steel 
reinforcement, but cannot predict its future condition. Concrete surface condition w.r.t moisture, 
has a significant role in measurement (ii) On very dry concrete surfaces having concrete 
resistivity, ρ> 1000 Ωm, measurements are difficult to obtain or the method gives misleading 
results. (iii) Difficulty in selecting a suitable equilibration time at which to monitor the current 
response to the applied potential shift. This is because the resistance is made up from a number 
of different mechanisms occurring within the concrete which include those interfacial resistances 
at the surface of the bar which are directly related to corrosion and those resistances associated 
with the bulk concrete and, to calculate the corrosion rate accurately it is necessary to select the 
measurement time required to evaluate those processes directly associated with corrosion but 
to exclude those processes associated with the bulk concrete.
Method can be used to assess the present corrosion condition of the reinforcement, that is, to 
discriminate between corroding and non-corroding (passivated) zones. It may also be used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a repair work.

19. 
PENETRATION RESISTANCE/WINDSOR PROBE TEST
Probes can be used to determine the resistance to penetration of hardened concrete by either 
a steel probe or pin.
Probe penetration relates to some property of the concrete below the surface, and within limits, 
it has been possible to develop empirical correlations between strength properties and the 
penetration of the probe.
The Windsor probe consists of a powder-actuated gun or driver, hardened alloy steel probes, loaded 
cartridges, a depth gauge for measuring the penetration of probes, and other related equipment. 
The probes have a tip diameter of 6.3 mm, a length of 79.5 mm, and a conical point. Probes of 
7.9 mm diameter are also available for the testing of concrete made with lightweight aggregates. 
The rear of the probe is threaded and screws into a probe driving head, which is 12.7 mm in 
diameter and fits snugly into the bore of the driver. The test can also be performed with a pin.
Two different methods available for resistance test i.e. with Probes or with Pins. The probe 
is driven into the concrete by the firing of a precision powder charge that develops energy of 
79.5  m kg. For the testing of relatively low strength concrete, the power level can be reduced by 
pushing the driver head further into the barrel. The area to be tested must have a brush finish or 
a smooth surface as it affects the result.
The evaluation of test can be done only after a co-relation is established with a sample; practical 
procedure for developing such a relationship is outlined below.
	
i.	
Prepare a number of 150 mm × 300 mm cylinders, or 150 mm3 and companion 
600 mm × 600 mm × 200 mm concrete slabs covering a strength range that is 
to be encountered on a job site. Use the same cement and the same type and 
size of aggregates as those to be used on the job. Cure the specimens under 
standard moist curing conditions, keeping the curing period the same as the 
specified control age in the field.
	
ii.	
Test three specimens in compression at the age specified, using standard 
testing procedure. Then fire three probes into the top surface of the slab at least 
150 mm apart and at least 150 mm in from the edges. If any of the three probes 
fails to properly penetrate the slab, remove it and fire another. Make sure that at 
least three valid probe results are available. Measure the exposed probe lengths 
and average the three results.
	
iii.	
Repeat the above procedure for all test specimens.
	
iv.	
Plot the exposed probe length against the compressive strength, and fit a curve 
or line by the method of least squares. The 95% confidence limits for individual 
results may also be drawn on the graph. These limits will describe the interval 
within which the probability of a test result falling is 95%.
The probe is simple to operate, requires little maintenance except cleaning the barrel and is not 
sensitive to operator technique. The test is relatively quick and the result is achieved immediately 
provided an appropriate correlation curve is available. Access for measurement is only needed 
to one surface. The correlation with concrete strength is affected by a relatively small number 
of variables. Pullout test can be used advantageously for inaccessible areas and section having 
dense rebar placement.

The minimum acceptable distance from a test location to any edges of the concrete member or 
between two test locations is of the order of 150 mm to 200 mm. The minimum thickness of the 
member, which can be tested, is about three times the expected depth of probe penetration. The 
distance from the rebar affects the reliability of test. The distance from reinforcement can also 
have an effect on the depth of probe penetration especially when the distance is less than about 
100 mm. The test is limited to <40 MPa and if two different levels are used in an investigation 
to accommodate a larger range of concrete strengths, the correlation procedure becomes 
complicated. This where co-relation can Such relationships are more reliable if both pullout test 
specimens and compressive strength test specimens are of similar size, consolidated to similar 
density, and cured under similar conditions and same age of concrete.
20.	
PERMEABILITY TEST
This test is used to determine the permeability of concrete in-situ, or concrete specimens either 
cast in the laboratory or obtained by extracting cores from existing structures.
Permeability is a property that governs the rate of flow of fluid into a porous solid. In case of 
concrete, it can be used to characterize its transport properties that link to its durability. Depending 
on the mechanism of movement of fluids in to concrete, the transport processes are classified 
into three categories, namely,
	
i.	
Absorption - movement of fluid due to capillary forces created inside the capillary 
forces.
	
ii.	
Permeation - movement of fluid due to action of pressure.
	
iii.	
Diffusion/migration - movement of fluid due to concentration gradient, with or 
without an applied electrical field.
It may be noted that the above mechanisms may be acting on concrete structures together or 
separately on different occasions, depending on exposure conditions. Test methods, suitable 
for in-situ testing or for testing on specimen extracted from the structure, or on laboratory 
cast specimen for evaluation of different concrete mixes, have been developed to assess the 
permeability of concrete to fluids (air, water or chlorides) based on the above mechanisms. 
Generally, the air permeability test is carried out first and then the water permeability test is 
done on the same specimen. However, not all methods have been adopted as standard test 
procedures. The following Table A T2 lists most of the test methods available as standards / 
developed for the three transport mechanisms.

Air permeability
Determination of air permeability of concrete is useful to assess its state of compaction, presence 
of bleed voids and channels, and the degree of interconnectedness of the pore structure. It is 
determined either in terms of time over which a pressure applied to a concrete surface of known 
surface area decreases by a certain value, or increase in pressure over a concrete surface 
of known surface area on which vacuum was created previously, or in terms of suitable units. 
Good correlation between Oxygen Permeability Index (OPI) values recorded at 28 days and 
carbonation depths after natural exposure were reported. 
Water Permeability
Water permeability of concrete is measured as a flow of water under a constant or decreasing 
pressure gradient through concrete. This property is of great importance when an assessment 
of hydro structures, reservoirs or any other civil engineering structure such as sub-structures 
in bridges etc. that are in direct contact with water is carried out. Structures exposed to harsh 
environmental conditions also require low porosity as well as permeability.
Instruments for testing water permeability on-site usually consist of a reservoir filled with water, 
which is connected to the concrete surface, a syringe or vacuum pump for introducing pressure 
into the reservoir and a transducer for monitoring pressure. Most of the laboratory methods 
consist of subjecting a mortar or concrete specimen of known dimensions, contained in a 
specially designed cell, to a known hydrostatic pressure from one side, measuring the quantity 
of water percolating through it during a given interval of time and computing the coefficient of 
permeability. The test permits measurement of the water entering the specimen as well as that 
leaving it.

The test results may be affected due to: Moisture conditions; concrete mix; aggregate; surface 
finish and type; curing, age of concrete, cracking, water type and temperature may affect the 
permeability.
Many of the methods mentioned above are developed to be simple. 
Although the in-situ tests require minimum surface preparation, some of the laboratory methods 
need conditioning of the specimen. While some tests are completed in 10-15 minutes after 
preparation and condition, other tests need longer times from 1-3 days, or more.
The methods do not measure permeability directly but provide res a ‘Permeability Index’ or 
permeability coefficient, or sometimes, which is related closely to the method of measurement. 
Most of these methods measure the permeability or porosity of the surface layer of concrete 
and not the intrinsic permeability of the core of the concrete. For the ISAT, tests on oven 
dried specimens give reasonably consistent results but in other cases results are less reliable 
encountered with in situ use in achieving a watertight fixing. The test has been found to be very 
sensitive to changes in quality and to correlate with observed weathering behaviour.

Alkali-aggregate reaction occurs when minerals in certain aggregates react with the soluble 
alkaline components of the cement paste. There are two main forms of alkali-aggregate reaction 
namely, alkali-silica reaction and alkali-carbonate reaction. 
The method involves visual examination of polished slabs under a binocular microscope, followed 
by detailed examination of thin sections under a polarizing microscope. The flowchart illustrating

Samples for petrographic examination can be taken from lump samples or cores. Samples of 
mortar are impregnated with epoxy resin and sawn. The sections are prepared by careful grinding 
and polishing in a non-aqueous media. The polished surfaces are studied with at least 50x

magnification and features of interest are measured by traditional point counting techniques or 
image analysis. More detailed studies use auxiliary methods like Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(SEM) coupled with Back Scattered Electron Imaging (BEI) to evaluate the hydraulic content. 
X-Ray Diffraction (X-RD) is also used for determination of some crystalline components.
Equipment consists of (i) Zoom stereo binocular microscope (Fig. A24), (ii) A high quality 
petrological photomicroscope fitted with a digital camera and (iii) A point counting stage for the 
petrological microscope to enable point counting of thin sections.

The results of a petrography analysis are used to establish the quality of the concrete by:
	
i.	
Determination in detail of the condition of concrete in a construction.
	
ii.	
Determination of the causes of interior quality, dis-tress, or deterioration of 
concrete in a construction.
	
iii.	
Determination of the probable future performance of the concrete.
Broken fragments of concrete are generally not use in petrographic examination, because the 
damage to the concrete cannot be clearly identified as a function of the sampling technique or 
representative of the real condition of the concrete.
Method can also used for identification of alkali-aggregate reaction in thin section and polished 
slabs. Petrographic Testing it is possible to diagnose the main cause of failure in a structure.
This technique is mostly to be used for assessment of the durability of reinforced concrete 
members where reinforcement corrosion is suspected. The method is also commonly used when 
repairing buildings of historical significance. Elemental mapping aids in the viewing of particle 
sizes and distribution.

Pull-Out Test
To determine the in-situ concrete compressive strength Pull-Out Test.
This test is based on the principle that the force required to pull out a cone of steel embedded 
in concrete is proportional to the strength of concrete (Fig. A25). The insert is either cast into 
fresh concrete or installed in hardened concrete. The measured pull-out strength is indicative of 
the strength of concrete within the region represented by the conic frustum defined by the insert 
head and bearing ring. The pull-out strengths are indicative of the quality of the outer zone of 
concrete members and can be of benefit in evaluating the cover zone of reinforced concrete 
members.
In short the procedure is as under:
Inserts are placed at the location of tests. Such inserts are fixed to the location with bolts or proper 
fastening methods. The selected test surface shall be flat for drilling the core and undercutting the 
groove. Drill a core hole perpendicular to the surface to provide a reference point for subsequent 
operations. Use the expansion tool to position the expandable insert into the groove and expand 
the insert to its proper size. Place the bearing ring around the pullout insert shaft, connect the 
pullout shaft to the hydraulic ram, and tighten the pullout assembly snugly against the bearing 
surface, checking to see that the bearing ring is centered around the shaft and flush against the 
concrete. Apply load at a uniform rate so that the nominal normal stress on the assumed conical 
fracture surface increases. Record the maximum gage reading to the nearest half of the least 
division on the dial. It is to be borne in mind that levelling, curing period of grout in hole may 
affect the results.
Fig. A25 Pull-Out Test
Levelling, curing period of grout in hole may affect the results. 
For a given concrete and a given test apparatus, pullout strengths can be related to compressive 
strength test results. Such strength relationships are affected by the configuration of the 
embedded insert, bearing ring dimensions, depth of embedment and the type of aggregate 
(lightweight or normal weight). Before use, the relationships must be established for each test 
system and each new concrete mixture. Such relationships are more reliable if both pullout test

specimens and compressive strength test specimens are of similar size, consolidated to similar 
density, and cured under similar conditions. 
This test method does not provide statistical procedures to estimate other strength properties. 
The disadvantage of the pull out test is that it causes small damage to the concrete is required 
to be repaired.
If a strength relationship has been established experimentally and accepted by the specifier of 
tests, pullout tests are used to estimate the in-place strength of concrete to establish whether it 
has reached a specified level so that, like (i) post-tensioning may proceed, (ii) forms and shores 
may be removed, (iii) structure may be placed into service, or (iv) winter protection and curing 
may be terminated. In addition, post-installed pullout tests may be used to estimate the strength 
of concrete in existing construction. Pullout test can be used advantageously for inaccessible 
areas and section having dense rebar placement. 
This test can be performed provided co-relation is established and accepted. Co-relation can 
are more reliable if both pullout test specimens and compressive strength test specimens are of 
similar size, consolidated to similar density, cured under similar conditions and has same age of 
concrete.

RESISTIVITY MEASUREMENT
Resistivity measurement is useful for identifying areas of reinforced concrete at risk from 
corrosion. For evaluating susceptibility of rebar corrosion in the given environment – concrete 
matrix.
This test works on a simple principle (Fig. A26) of current applied between the two outer probes 
and the potential difference measured between the two inner probes.
Fig. A26 Schematic of Wenner 4 probe Resistivity Meter
The equipment consists of four electrodes (two outer current probes and two inner voltage 
probes) which are placed in a straight line on or just below the concrete surface at equal spacing.

A low frequency alternating electrical current is passed between the two outer electrodes whilst 
the voltage drop between the inner electrodes is measured.
For evaluating susceptibility of rebar corrosion in the given environment concrete matrix. 
Corrosion risk or activity of steel in concrete, the apparent resistivity (ρ) in “ohm-cm” may be 
expressed as:
ρ=2πa(V/I)
Where, V is voltage drop, I is applied current, and a is electrode spacing and the resistivity 
values are given in the Table A T3 below for the rate of corrosion.

Resistivity measurement is a fast, simple and cheap in situ non-destructive method to obtain 
information related to the corrosion hazard of embedded reinforcement. with little or no damage 
to the concrete structures.
To establish reliability of corrosion evaluationIt may be used in conjunction with other corrosion 
tests such as the half-cell potential measurement or linear polarization measurement method.
Conditioning of concrete surface required for meaningful results.
24.	
TRANSIENT DYNAMIC RESPONSE TEST
To locate delamination, cracking or loss of integrity in concrete the Transient Dynamic Response 
Test can be used.
The test procedure uses the propagation of wave in a media to determine the impedance and 
mobility of the section. The mobility of section, frequency of the wave, area of cross section 
where the test is applied, length of wave propagation can be used to calculate the compressive 
strength of the concrete. 
In principle, for each step, the wave from an incident pulse travels through the section and is 
partly or wholly reflected at impedance changes within the member. If any of these returning 
reflections are in phase with the incident frequency, resonant makes the response of the section 
maximum. A graph of the maximum velocity against frequency of excitation would therefore 
show a series of resonating peaks with intervening troughs. This is the main principle on which 
TDR works is shown in Fig. A27 below:

======================================================================

IRC:SP:40-2019
111
Fig. A27 The TDR Principle& Set up
Applying an impulse force to the section, usually by striking it with a light hand-held instrumented 
hammer, carries out the test. This impulse force is to be measured by means of a small electronic 
dynamic load cell. The response of the section to the hammer blow is to be measured by a 
velocity transducer (or geophone) held on the surface of the section. The force wave imparted 
onto the section and the resulting velocity response of the section are separately analyzed.
The tests is carried out first by striking the surface and recording the reading as an average 
of best correlated three reading from the four reading taken. Test measurements may be 
presented either an equi-potential contour map or the cumulative frequency diagram, indicating 
the magnitude of affected area of the concrete member.
Impedance at any given level in the section is therefore usually expressed by the relationship 
below:
z = ρ.c.A
where ρ is the density of the material used, c is the propagation velocity of the stress wave and 
A is the cross sectional area of the section.
For slabs and pavements a diameter of 1000 mm. is be considered for the cross sectional area. 
It is imperative that the transmitter and the receiver are kept within this diameter.
The results of this test could be affected due to traffic moving on the bridge. As any movement 
causes vibrations that will also be recorded by the geophone. 
One of the major advantage of this test is that it is rapid and if all sections are prepared a single 
team can test about a hundred sections. But this test cannot be performed on new concrete 
sections where the concrete is not fully set. 
In the recent advances TDR evaluates mobility of the section, using it with available geometrical 
data and the frequency interval we can get the characteristic strength of a section.

TREPANNING TEST
Trepanning technique is developed to assess the in-situ stress under biaxial stress state.
The proposed technique employs a three element strain gage rosette to measure the strain 
release due to core-drilling (Fig. A28).
Fig. A28 Trepanning Equipment
The evaluation of in-situ stresses under bi-axial stress state by using concrete core trepanning 
technique was developed.
Experimental studies for assessment of stresses under biaxial stress condition can be carried 
out on ten specimens with different combination of loads.
The main advantage to the method is that the strains released on the core itself can be quite 
large, depending on the nature of the stress being investigated.
This method has several disadvantages when compared to the incremental core-drilling method 
like (i) The strain gauge must be bonded to the structure in question and must stay bonded 
through the coring process, (ii) The strain gauge must be aligned with the direction of maximum 
principal stress. This is not always known a priori and (iii) The wiring for the bonded gages must 
be kept undamaged and out of the way during the coring process, which might be difficult in a 
field situation.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
(A)	
Sulphate Content
The sulphate content of a sample is determined through precipitation of barium sulphate using 
barium chloride.
The chemical reagents used for the method are: (a).Hydrochloric acid (b) Dilute hydrochloric 
acid (c) Ammonium hydroxide solution (d) Barium chloride solution, and (e) Methyl red indicator 
solution.
The concrete sample is broken / crushed into a fine powder, passing 150 micron sieve (preferably 
100 micron), ensuring in the process that the mortar part only is crushed and visible aggregate 
(coarse or fine) particles are excluded. Sufficient quantity (i.e. up to 25-30 grams) of powder is

prepared so that at least three iterations can be carried out. The cement content of this sample 
is determined as per the procedure given BS 1881-Pt. 124, Section 5.9, or estimated from the 
mix proportions, if available. 
Concrete powder sample of 5 ± 0.005 gm is weighed into a 400 ml beaker, in to which 50 ml 
of water and add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added. After adding 50 ml of 
hot water, the beaker is covered the and the contents are boiled gently for 5 min to 10 min. 
The cooled contents of the beaker are filtered through a medium ash less filter paper and the 
residue is washed thoroughly with hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part conc HCl + 49 parts 
water). Three drops of methyl red indicator are added to the filtrate (the liquid which has 
passed the filter paper) and the same is heated to boiling. The filtrate is just neutralized to 
yellow with dilute ammonium hydroxide solution. Immediately after that, 1 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid is added to it and followed by drop--wise addition of 10 ml of barium chloride 
solution to the boiling solution. If excess ammonium hydroxide was added, 1 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid may not be sufficient to obtain the required acid solution and the barium 
sulphate precipitate will then be contaminated. In this case the test shall be repeated. The 
solution is then boiled gently for 5 min, keeping the solution at just below boiling for 30 min. 
The solution is then allowed to remain at room temperature for 12 to 24 hr., and then filtered 
through a slow ashless filter paper, washing the residue free from chlorides with hot water. 
The filter paper and contents are transferred to a weighed silica or platinum crucible and 
burnt-off without flaming. The precipitate is ignited at 800 ºC to 900 ºC until a constant mass 
is achieved.

L is the mass of ignited barium sulphate (in gm).
IS: 2720-Part 27 (Indian standard methods of test for soils- Part 27- Determination of total soluble 
sulphates) is also based on similar principle. The same may also be adopted with suitable 
modifications.

Acid Soluble (total) Chloride Content
The chloride content in a concrete sample is determined through titration with silver nitrate 
solution by Volhard method. 
The concrete sample is broken / crushed into a fine powder, passing 150 micron sieve (preferably 
100 micron), ensuring in the process that the mortar part only is crushed and visible aggregate

(coarse or fine) particles are excluded. Sufficient quantity (i.e. upto 25-30 grams) of powder is 
prepared so that at least three iterations can be carried out. The cement content of this sample 
is determined as per the procedure given BS 1881-Pt. 124, Section 5.9, or estimated from the 
mix proportions, if available.
The chemical reagents used for the testing are: (a) Nitric acid, relative density 1.4 (b) Silver 
nitrate standard solution, 0.1 mol/L (c) Thiocyanate standard solution, approx. 0.1 mol/L (d) Iron 
III indicator solution (Ammonium Ferric Sulphate solution added with 10 mL of nitric acid, (e) 
3,5,5 - trimethylhexanol (nonyl alcohol).
A powdered sample of concrete weighing 5 ± 0.005 g is taken into a stoppered 500 ml conical 
flask. 50 ml of water and 10 ml of nitric acid are added to the sample in the conical flask. 50 ml 
of hot water is added to the mixture and the mixture is boiled for 4 to 5 min. The mixture is kept 
warm for 10 min to 15 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is then 
filtered through an ashless filter paper into a flask and the remainder is washed with hot water. 
A measured excess of the silver nitrate standard solution is added into the beaker. Then, 2 to 
3 ml of nonyl alcohol is added, the flask is stoppered and shaken vigorously to coagulate the 
precipitate. Then 1 ml of iron III indicator solution is added and titrated with the thiocyanate 
solution to the first permanent red colour.
The acid soluble chloride content J of the concrete sample is calculated as a percentage of the 
cement to the nearest 0.01 % (m/m) from the expression:

Where,
	
Mc is the mass of sample used (in g);
	
Vs is the volume of 0.1M silver nitrate solution added (in mL);
	
V6 is the volume of thiocyanate solution used (in mL);
	
m is the molarity of the thiocyanate solution (in mol/L);
	
C1 is the cement content of the sample used (in %).
Factors affecting the test results are:
	
i.	
Loss of material, particularly dust, during the crushing and grinding operations 
should be minimized for better results.
	
ii.	
Exposure to Atmospheric carbon dioxide.
IS 14959 (Indian standard-Determination of water soluble and acid soluble chlorides in mortar 
and concrete — Method of test) also is based on titration and can be adopted. However, the 
sampling method is slightly different.
Test method based on potentiometric principles using ion-selective electrodes are also available. 
They also may be adopted to determine the chloride content of concrete samples. Rapid test kits 
for in-situ chloride determination are also available and may be employed. However, in case of 
any dispute, the chemical method is taken as reference.

Loss of material, particularly dust, during the crushing and grinding operations should be minimize 
for better results. Exposure to Atmospheric carbon dioxide affects the result. 
The samples from other NDT tests like core cutting, pull out can be used.

CRACK MEASUREMENTS
The appearance of cracks is a phenomenon that cannot be predicted a priori, very often evaluating 
their effects is complicated and costly when using traditional techniques. The possibility to have 
monitoring systems that allow to accurately locate and to obtain crack width dimensions has 
become a challenge. 
Width of Cracks can be found out.
