IRC:34-2011
INTRODUCTION
In water logged areas, due to water, whether from capillary
rise, seepage from earthen
shoulders or penetration from pavement layers, the subgrade of pavements gets saturated.
Reduction
in load carrying capacity of subgrade
is related to the degree of saturation of
subgrade. The strength of pavement layers laid over the subgrade is dependent on the support
of subgrade. Due to loss in load carrying capacity of subgrade, the strength of pavement
layers also reduces. Load from traffic remaining the same with the reduction in strength of
subgrade, pavement deterioration gets accelerated.
It is common observation that pavement
which behaves very well during summer months suddenly starts getting damaged on on-set
of monsoon. During the prolonged period of monsoon, the pavement gets affected by water
develops cracks which get converted into potholes.
Pavements with good drainage remain intact even during monsoon. The water entering the
subgrade has to be drained out or prevented from reaching upto subgrade level.
Realizing the advantages that can be had by keeping water away from subgrade, Shri Mahesh
Kumar Convenor H-4 Committee Engineer-in-Chief Haryana PWD, thought to have a re-
look into the IRC:34:1 970, "Recommendation for road construction in water logged areas".
The work of rewriting the revised version was done by a subgroup consisting of Shri Arun
Kumar Sharma, CE, MORT&H, Mrs. Minimol Korulla, Chief Consultant and Ms. Shabana
Khan, Consultant, Macaferri. Their valuable contribution is greatly acknowledged.
The revision of document includes recommendations to use modern materials and techniques
for solving problems associated with water logging. Some
of the modern techniques
recommended are
a)
Drainage of storm water into underground aquifer by vertical drain.
b)
Drainage of sub sub-surface water by edge drains. Fin drains etc.
c)
Drainage of water by French drains.
d)
Depressing of level of sub soil water by drainage composites.
e)
Capillary cut off by geomembrane.
Recommendations for some case studies have been made in the revised document. The
draft revision was approved by H-4 Committee (Personnel given below) in the meeting held
on 13.10.2010. The Highways Specification and Standards Committee deliberated on this
document on 22.1 0.201 0 and cleared for presentation in Council Meeting. At Nagpur Council
Meeting the document was cleared with authority to Convenor to modify as per comments of
Council members. The Convenor further reviewed the document in light of the comments of
the Council members. The document was submitted for printing by the Convenor on
12.03.2011.

1 SCOPE
These recommendations deal with the problem of road construction in waterlogged areas,
including those subjected to flooding and/or infested with detrimental salts like sulphates
and carbonates. The recommendations relate both to the construction of new roads and to
the remedial measures to be adopted in the case of existing roads.
1 .1
For the purpose of these recommendations for coarse grained soil, water logged
areas are considered to be those where the level of subsoil standing water is such that for
prolonged periods the bottom of subgrade immediately below the pavement is well within
the capillary fringe of the water table i.e. within about 1 .5 m. For embankment with fine grained
soils the capillary fringe of water table may be up to 10.0 m.

IRC:34-2011
1.2
Remedial measures
for
following
situations
are
included
in
these
recommendations:
i)
Existing roads on low embanltments and subgrade within capillary
fringe
: Such roads frequently get damaged whenever water stands on the
ground, (for details refer para 4.5.2.5 and 8.1).
ii)
Construction of new carriageway at a higher level, compared to the
existing carriageway on low embankment
: The water from central verge
saturates the inner shoulder of existing carriageway
(for details
refer
para 8.2).
iii)
Drainage of water from roads in cutting
: Wet portion of side slopes is
an indication that phreatic line is cutting the side slopes. Higher water level
.
in side slopes will saturate the subgrade below the pavement (for details
refer para 8.3).
iv)
Hill roads with phreatic line cutting the side of hill slope
: Wet portion
of side slope of
hill above pavement is an indication that phreatic line
is
above the pavement level. Higher water table will soak the subgrade (for
details refer para 8.4).
v)
Bund roads by the side of rivers/canals
:
In general bund roads along
canals are located at a higher level with respect to full supply level in the
canal. In case full supply level in the canal is at a higher level, than level of
bund road, subgrade of bund road will get affected by seepage water from
canal (for details refer para 8.5).
vi)
Drainage of pavement at bends in hills
: Lack of drainage in
hills will
soak the subgrade of pavement (for details refer para 8.6)
vii)
Drainage of land between road and
rail track
: Effective drainage of
water from area between road and
rail track
is required, otherwise the
standing water will saturate the subgrade of pavement (for details refer
para 8.7).
viii)
Drainage of road with
built up areas on both sides of road and
discharging water on road
: Lack of effective drainage
will
result
in
soaking of subgrade of pavements (for details refer para 5.3 and 8.8).
ix)
Road embankments over-topped by flood water, the subgrade
will get
soaked due to water (for details refer para 5.2 and 8.9).
1 .3
Due to soaking of subgrade, frequent formation of cracks in pavement and then
conversion of cracks to potholes are common in all these cases mentioned in para 1 .2 above.
Water in pot holes accelerates deterioration of pavements. These cracks and potholes require
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:34-2011
frequent repairs. These roads in addition to capillary rise of ground water leading to softening
of subgrade may also be affected by flooding and/or ground water infested with detrimental
salts like sulphates and carbonates.
2
ISSUES INVOLVED IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION
IN AREAS AFFECTED BY WATER
2.1
Due to Water Logging
As a result of migration of water by capillary action from the high water table/high flood level,
the subgrade soil gets further saturated and this leads to a gradual loss in its bearing capacity.
With the loss
in bearing capacity of soil, axle load remaining the same, deterioration of
pavement gets accelerated.
It is important to ensure the drainage of storm water and lowering
of subsoil water so that subgrade remains dry. Remedial measures should be taken to keep
water away from subgrade.
2.2
Due to Flooding
Where continuous flooding for long periods takes place the progressive deformation of
subgrade and pavement
is accentuated by ingress of water from the top of the wearing
surface, earthen shoulders or sides of embankment. The flood water saturates the subgrade
thus reducing the bearing capacity. In case of bituminous pavements, the already inadequate
waterproofing of the surface is impaired further by stripping of the binder due to prolonged
contact with water. While
in the concrete pavement, water in the subgrade may lead to
pumping and cracking of pavement.
2.2.1
Embankment should be designed to withstand the effect of flooding.
2.2.2
Sufficient cross drainage structures should be provided so that water can pass
across the embankments.
2.2.3
In case flood water cannot be allowed to flow across the embankment, due to
likelihood of submergence of human settlements on the other sides of embankment, then
embankment should be designed to withstand the effect of flood water. Good quality granular
soil should be used in embankment construction so that the soil remains intact during flooding.
During high floods, phreatic line should remain well within the cross section of earthen
embankment. Services of geotechnical/irrigation engineer should be taken for design of
such embankment which
is more or less acting as an earthen dam. Seepage across
embankment and possibility of piping should be taken care of.
2.3
Due to Presence of Detrimental Salts
The problem is aggravated
if in addition to water logging and/or flooding, harmful salts like
sulphates of sodium, calcium or magnesium and sodium carbonate are present either in the
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 40
======================================================================
iRC:34-2011
sub grade soil or in the ground water. Damage to crust from liarmful salts can be in two ways
- due to physical or chemical effect.
2.3.1
Physical effect of the harmful salts
In waterlogged areas (infested with detrimental salts), the salts keep on moving up with
capillary moisture. During subsequent evaporation of the salt-laden water, the salts are left
behind and they get concentrated in the surface layers. The salts increase many times in
volume upon hydration under suitable humidity and temperature conditions. Alternate*
hydration and dehydration results in repeated formation of salt crystals occupying much more
volume than the amorphous salts lodged in the voids. In due course, these repeated volume
changes break up the structure of the pavement, working from the top downwards particularly
due to seepage/capillary rise.
2.3.2
Chemical effect of the harmful salts
The damage due to chemical action is mainly on account of sulphates of calcium, magnesium
or sodium. Construction works specially vulnerable to this type of attack are those containing
cement like cement concrete pavements and stabilized soil cement base/subbase courses.
2.3.2.1
Cement concrete
The sulphates present in the subsoil which migrate to the top by capillary action, react with
the free lime liberated from cement resulting
in the formation of gypsum. The reaction
is
accompanied by a considerable increase in the volume of the solids which is known to lead
to the destruction of the hydrated cement matrix. After gypsum has been formed, or
if calcium
sulphate
itself
is found
in that soil or ground water, tri-calcium aluminate
in the hydrated
cement combined with sulpho-aluminate which gives rise to further expansion of volume and
damage. Apart from the formation
of gypsum and calcium sulpho-aluminate, the
decomposition of hydrated calcium silicate by sulphate solution is an additional factor affecting
the durability of concrete. However, this would occur normally only in the case of calcium or
magnesium sulphate solution which is found generally in waterlogged areas near the sea.
Dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate salts present in certain marshy and rice growing
areas also take part in the leaching of lime liberated from hydration of cement and slowly
attacking the cementitious calcium
silicate hydrated gel formed. Such solutions are
characterized by pH value in the acidic range, usually below 5.
Concrete is not directly attacked by solid sulphate salts, but only by their solutions in water
so that
it is the amount of salts dissolved in the ground water that determines the rate of
*
(As a result of research carried out in India,
it has been demonstrated that crystallization
of sodium sulphate takes place when temperature is below 32 degree Celsius and relative
humidity above 80 percent.
In northern parts of the country these conditions exist
generally during the period of winter rains)

IRC:34-2011
attack. As a result of chemical action of sulphates, the cement concrete pavements suffer
internal disintegration and gradual falling from the underside. The process described
is,
however, slow.
2.3.2.2
Soil cement
:
Presence of sulphates in waterlogged areas has a detrimental effect on soil cement mixtures
similar to that in the case of cement concrete pavements.
2.3.2.3
Bituminous construction
It does not appear that these salts, in the concentration they normally occur in soil, ground
water or sea water have any detrimental chemical effect on bituminous construction.
2.3.2.4
Water-bound macadam
Salts do not directly affect un-surfaced water bound macadam constructions provided the
filler material used in them is inert and free of harmful constituents.
3
RECOMMENDATIONS ON METHODS OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION
IN AREAS AFFECTED BY WATER
3.1
The recommendations are divided into the following three groups
:
a)
Road construction in areas where the problem is of water logging.
b)
Road construction in areas where in addition to water logging, flooding for
prolonged periods is also expected.
c)
Road construction in areas where in addition to water logging, harmful salts
are present in the subsoil or ground water.
3.2
Different treatments are suggested under each group. Some of these can be made
use only on new construction, and others on old, while some hold good for both. Broad
guidelines about these are provided at the beginning of each section.
4 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN AREAS
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS OF THE WATER
LOGGING ALONE
The remedial measures recommended under paragraphs 4.1 to 4.6 could be utilized both
on new constructions and existing roads. However, the capillary cutoff technique described
under para 4.7 will be found economical only on new roads.

4.1
Depressing the Level of Subsoil Water by Drainage Measures
Satisfactory results could be achieved by providing
1 .50 to
1 .80 m deep drainage channels
(below the ground line) as close to the road bank as shown in Fig. 4.1
. These channels are
connected by suitable outfalls to natural drainage. Alternatively, buried drains of suitable
design such as French/Fin drains could be provided at the edges of the pavement for lowering
of water table. Either of these measures will be effective in keeping the bottom of subgrade
above the capillary fringe. This method
of drainage
is applicable to
all types of road
construction (whether
rigid or flexible) and should be preferred wherever economically
feasible.

4. 2
Raising of the Embankment
Where
it is too expensive or impractical to provide deep drainage channels as specified in
para 4.1 above,
it
is recommended to do a careful examination of the economics of the
case, and an embankment of such height may be provided that the bottom of the subgrade
remains at least
1 .5 m above the highest water-table/highest flood water level as shown in
Fig. 4.2. The earth work over existing road surface shall be as per Clause No.300 of MORT&H
Specifications which is reproduced below
:
"Earthwork over existing road surface: Where the embankment is to be placed over an existing
road surface, the work shall be carried out as indicated below.
i)
If the existing road surface is of granular type and lies within
1 .0 m of the
new formation level,
it shall be scarified to a depth of 50 mm or as directed
so as to provide ample bond between the old and new material. The
thickness of the soil layer,
if any, interposed between the bottom of the
sub-base and the top of the scarified surface, shall not be less than 0.5 m,
and the
soil
shall meet the specified properties and compaction
requirements as for the subgrade.
ii)
If the existing road surface is of bituminous type or cement concrete, and
lies within
1 .0 m of the new sub-grade level, the bituminous layer shall be
removed completely and the requirements specified in para
(i) above are
to be met with.

iii)
If the
level difference between the existing road surface and the new
formation level is more than
1 .0 m, the existing surface shall be roughened,
after ensuring that minimum thickness of 0.5 m of subgrade is available".

Drainage of Storm Water into Underground Aquifer
In case,
it is not possible to provide drainage system for disposal of storm water then the
storm water can be drained into underground aquifer by providing vertical drains. For more
details about vertical drains for storm water drainage refer IRC:SP-50. Cross-section of
vertical drain is shown in Fig. 4.3. Salient features of vertical drains are:
a)
The discharge of storm water is in permeable strata.
b)
The perforations in the PVC pipe are covered with Geotextile.
c)
The
inlet pipes of vertical drain are 750 mm above the bottom of
inlet
chamber so that debris will not enter the vertical drain. The debris stored in
the inlet chamber can be cleaned.
d)
Inflow of storm water is through removable perforated R.C.C cover slab

IRC:34-2011
4.4
Providing Thickness of the Pavement as Per Subgrade Strength
Efforts should be made to provide longitudinal drains or sufficiently high embankment or
capillary cutoff or discharge of water into ground aquifer to keep subgrade dry. The thickness
of the pavement should be determined as per IRC:37 and construction as per MORT&H
"Specifications for Road and Bridge Works".
4.5
Lowering Water Entrapped in the Pavement
4.5.1
Roads on low height embankments
If practical and economically possible, the bottom of subgrade level should be raised by
minimum
1.50 m above the general ground level/high flood
level. Work of raising the
embankment shall be done as per Clause 13.1 of iRC:36 or relevant clauses of MORT&H
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
In case resources don't justify
raising
of
embankment, then lowering of local water table is second best alternative.
4.5.2
Drainage of sub surface water
For details, reference can be made to IRC:SP-50 Clause No. 8. 5.
4.5.2. 1
Salient requirements are given below for ready reference
a)
Darcy's Law is applicable for subsurface flow of water.

Field observations and discharge measurement on the completed works
to assess the performance of subsurface drainage arrangement should be
carried out. Based on the measurement, the depth of subsurface drain is
increased or additional provision for subsurface drain
is made at closer
spacing.
c)
Some typical arrangements indicating use of formation drains and drainage
blanket is shown in Fig. 4.7.5. The drainage can be affected by installation
of solid pipes with open joints, perforated pipes surrounded by free draining
material or the filter The filter material is required to prevent fine soil particles
from flowing into the system, at the same time
it should have required degree
of permeability to drain off the required quantity of water. Also, the filter
material must be more permeable than the surrounding material for stable
flow situations and filter material not to flow into perforations or joints in
drainage pipes.

"A properly designed and installed aggregate filter should be able to retain soil and prevent
soil particle movement, thus eliminating piping potential. Properly, designed aggregate filters
ensure that there are no large voids within the filter and particularly at the soil filter interface
of a subsurface drainage structure. A single component aggregate filter may be used to
protect
relatively coarse soils whereas drainage through fine soils usually requires a
multi-layered aggregate filter. A multi-layered filter consists of a fine aggregate gradation
which retains the natural soil particles at their original positions and a coarser filter aggregate
which prevents particles of the fine aggregate filter from migrating into the perforations of a
drainage pipe or granular water transport medium." A properly designed and
installed
aggregate
filter should be able to retain
soil and prevent
soil
particle movement, thus
eliminating piping
potential. Grading requirements for
filter material given

Drainage of low height embankments by edge drains
Drainage of low height embankment by edge drain
is recommended for embankment
constructed with granular soil which allows flow of water in pavement/embankment to edge
drain. Trench
is cut along the road on both earthen shoulders adjacent to carriageway in
sufficient width and depth from top of surface.
In the trench, 150 mm dia suitable P.V.C/
polymeric/synthetic pipe (lower half periphery perforated) can be laid in a proper slope

drained out of embankment as shown in Fig. 4.5.2.5. The pipe in longitudinal trench shall
have holes
in lower
half.
Perforation diameter should be decided as described
in
Clause No. 12 of IRC:42 as reproduced below.
Size of the holes may be close to D85 size of material surrounding the pipe subject to being
minimum 3 mm and maximum 6 mm. D85 stands for size of the sieve that allows 85 percent
of the material to pass through
it. The back fill may consist of sand gravel material or crushed
stone satisfying the grading of Table 4.5.2.5

French drains are edge drains which consist of two components, permeable drainage media
and filter media. Permeable drainage media ensures that water can be transported within
the drain. The
filter ensures controlled movement of ground water from the soil into the
subsurface drain. In some instances, a porous pipe is installed at the base of the trench to
increase the water transport capacity of the drain. For french drains permeable drainage
media is graded gravel aggregate and filter media is Geotextile. French drains are shown
Fig. 4.5.2.6.

Geotextile. The plastic spacer/Geonet substitutes for the aggregate and acts as drainage
medium. The Geotextile acts as filter. Fin drains with thick plastic core are normally capable
of transporting water both vertically and horizontally with the structure, while thinner Fin drains
normally required the addition of a pipe to transport the water away, shown in Fig. 4.5.2.7.

Capillary Cutoff
4.7.1
As an alternative to the recommendations contained
in paras 4.1 and 4.2, a
capillary cutoff could be provided to arrest the capillary rise of water in the embankment.
Provision of capillary cutoffs could, however, may prove to be expensive and may be justified
only in special circumstances.
4.7.2
The capillary cutoff may be a layer of coarse or fine sand and graded gravel. For
details refer IRC:36-201 0. Layer thicknesses recommended for different situations are given
in Table 4.7.2.

The cutoff should be placed at least 0.15m above the ground level or the standing
water level, whichever is higher, as illustrated in Fig.4.7. But in no case
it shall be positioned
higher than 0.6 m below the top of the sub grade. When provided, the cutoff medium should
extend under the berms as well i.e. for full formation width as shown in Fig. 4.7 (for location
of cutoff with respect to ground level/high flood level). Apart from sand/granular material.
Drainage Composite as specified
in para 7.2.2 of this document can be considered as
suitable alternative for capillary cutoff. Drainage composite has Geomembrane on the
underside and geotextile filter on upper side. The drainage composite serves dual function
of cutoff as well as drainage media. The impermeable sheet helps in capillary cutoff, drainage
core allow the free flow of water and geotextile acts as separator and filter. The embankment
surface on which capillary cutoff is to be provided should have camber for gravity flow of
water through the drainage composite.
The surface of the embankment/sub-grade at all times during construction shall be maintained
at such a crossfali (not flatter than that required for effective drainage of an earthen surface)
as will shed water and prevent ponding.
.
4.7.4
Suitable types of capillary cutoffs are listed under Section 7. For any cutoff medium
say high density polythene sheet or drainage composite,
it will be advisable to cover it with a
1 5 cm thick layer of granular material like sand for the dual purpose of acting as a drainage
course for water infiltratmg from the top and of protecting the envelope during construction
against rupture by sharp particles in the
fill material. For drainage composite there
is no
need of additional cover of granular layer as the composite consists of geotextile as one
component which will provide protection while acting as a filter and the core of drainage
composite (geonet) will provide the drainage path.

5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN AREAS
WHERE IN ADDITION TO WATER LOGGING, FLOODING
FOR PROLONGED PERIODS IS ALSO EXPECTED
In the case of roads subjected to flooding in addition to water logging, the following measures
may have to be taken over and above those recommended in Section 4 against water logging.
The three treatments suggested could be applied equally on new constructions as well as on
existing roads.
5.1
Raising of the Embankment in Flood Prone Areas
5.1 .1
In areas subjected to frequent floods where the highest flood level is not too much
above the natural ground level,
it is recommended that the embankment should be raised so
that the bottom of the subgrade is at least
1 .50 m above the highest recorded flood level as
detailed in para 4.2.
5.1.2
The embankment will be subjected to wave action due to floods. To protect the
embankment from wave action, stone pitching of designed thickness over graded
filter/
geotextile is required.
"i
5.1.3
Provision of balancing culverts
Sufficient number of cross drainage structures as per site requirement should be provided,
for movement of water across the embankment. For free flow of water across the embankment
at least 2 culverts/km should be provided.
5.1 .4
In case, water current hits the embankment, cross drainage structures of adequate
waterway should be planned.
5.1 .5
In case,
it is not possible to provide sufficient cross drainage structures for water
to flow across the embankment, then the profile of road embankment should be as indicated
in Fig. 5.1.

Cross-Section of Road which gets Overtopped by Flood Water
Note
:
in the stretches where bank are not overtopped by flood by water, these should be
protected against erosion as per !RC:56-2010.
5.1.6
Submersible bridges or causeways may be designed and constructed in areas
subject to overtopping during floods.
5.2
Provision of Cement/Asphaftic Concrete Surfacing
In situations where
it
is considered inevitable to
let flood water pass over the road, also
traffic is heavy and flooding expected for prolonged periods, cement concrete surfacing of
appropriate thickness should be provided for at least two lanes of traffic. Wider paved surfaces
perform better under flooding due to distribution of traffic load in a wider area.
If the pavement
at the designated place of water crossing is flexible even then there is merit in providing a
layer of 50 mm bituminous concrete as wearing coat. The cement concrete pavement should
be provided for at least two lanes of traffic. The cement concrete pavement, when provided,
should have a dry lean concrete/cement/lime stabilized soil base of 1 5 cm thick underneath
the slab. When asphaltic concrete
is selected as the surfacing, the mix should be dense
graded and resistant to flood conditions.
The profile of the downstream side of embankment should allow smooth flow of water down
the embankment. For dissipation of energy of flow of water, a trough can be provided as
shown in Fig. 5.1.
5.3
In built up areas with houses/shops on either side of road, the water stagnates on
the road surface.
In case neither underground sewer system, deep drains, raising of sub
grade of existing road nor sub surface drain can be provided on an existing road,
it is better
to suggest realignment of the road. Till such time the bypass road is ready, the road crust as
shown in Fig. 5.3 may be provided. Use of well dressed stone/concrete paver block over a
layer of cement concrete (stone set in cement mortar) can be considered. For further details
following guidelines can be referred:
IRC:SP-63: Guidelines for the use of interlocking concrete block pavement

6 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN AREAS
WHERE IN ADDITION TO WATER LOGGING, DETRIMENTAL
SALTS ARE PRESENT IN THE SUBSOIL
OR GROUND WATER
The following recommendations apply generally to construction of new roads. On existing
roads, measures outlined in paras 4.1 to 4.6 may be adopted for relief.
6.1
No special measures are considered necessary from the standpoint of physical/
chemical action of harmful salts except those stated in Sections 4 and 5
if the concentration
of sulphates in the subgrade soil is below 0.2 percent (as sulphur trioxide) in ground water.
Similarly, sodium carbonate concentrations of up to 0.2 percent
in subgrade
soil and
0.02 per cent in the ground water are considered unharmful. Salt concentrations may be
determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in relevant I.SJ Standards - IS 2720,
Part XXIII 'Methods of Test for Soils: Determination of Calcium Carbonate', and IS 2720, part
XXVI l-'Methods of Test for Soils: Determination of Total Sulphate'.
No damage
is expected from dissolved carbon dioxide or bicarbonate salt solutions (met
with in certain marshy areas) provided the pH value of the solutions is higher than 5.
Where the concentration of these salts is in excess of the safe limits specified above, special
measures as indicated below are recommended as a guide for road construction. These
measures are in addition to those recommended in Section 4.
6.2
Flexible Pavements
6.2.1
Roads with granular base with or without bituminous surfacing
Even
if concentration of salts in the subgrade or ground water is higher than the safe limits
described
in para 6.1
, no special measures other than those set forth
in Section 4 are
considered necessary for water bound macadam roads with or without bituminous surfacing
except that the filler used in water bound macadam and soling should be inert and free from
harmful salts.

Stabilized soil construction
a)
Mechanical Stabilization
b)
Cement, Lime and flyash stabilization
- For details refer "Guidelines for
soil and granular material stabilization using Cement, Lime and Fly Ash"
(IRC:SP-89)
c)
Bituminous stabilization
If the above constructions are contemplated in waterlogged areas infested with salts, the
soil used for stabilization should not contain more than 0.2 percent of total soluble sulphates
and carbonates or stabiiization shall be with the cementitious materials which are resistant
to CI and SO^ salts.
Besides this, to prevent the harmful salts in the sub grade or ground water from coming in
contact with stabilized
soil course, a suitable capillary cutoff out of those described
in
para 4.7 should be provided underneath the pavement extending across the full width of the
roadway.
6.3
Rigid Pavements
When sulphates are in excess of the safe limits prescribed in para 6.1
, the following additional
measures are recommended during the construction of cement concrete pavements over
and above the provisions of paras 4.1 and 4.2.
6.3.1
Since
all types of concrete, irrespective of the type of cement used, are more
vulnerable to salt attack during the
initial period of hardening than when fully set,
it
is of
importance to prevent contact between the ground water and concrete in the early stages.
For this purpose, applying a light coat of bitumen to the underside of precast units, protecting
cast-in-situ concrete by a thin bituminized coating on the base just below the slab, or provision
of one of the capillary cutoffs mentioned in para 4.7, are some of the measures recommended
for adoption under relatively mild conditions of exposures to sulphate attack, viz., when sulphate
concentration in soil is upto about 0.5 percent.
Under more severe conditions, i.e. when sulphates are in excess of 0.5 percent, the bituminous
coatings used should be thicker (For the purposes of this specification, thin coats are
considered to be those in which the rate of application of straight-run bitumen is 12 kg per
10 m^ and thick coats are those in which the rate of application is 20 kg per 10 m^) as they
are known to possess higher durability.
Furthermore, the following measures are suggested as suitable for minimizing adverse
chemical effect of the sulphates on concrete:
1)
Designing a dense, well-compacted, high quality concrete which will have
low permeability against ingress of sulphate solution. (This is recommended
even when SO3, in water is above 0.02 percent).
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:34-2011
ii)
Use of special sulphate resistant cement, Pozzolanic cement, Portland slag
cement or high performance concrete as per IRC:SP-70.
6.3.2
In areas where there
is danger of damage from dissolved carbon dioxide or
bicarbonate salts as evidenced by pH values of below 5, the provision of a waterproof layer
below the concrete pavement, such as heavy duty bituminized paper or polythene sheet, and
use of a dense, well compacted, high quality concrete are the measures recommended for
adoption.
7
SUITABLE CAPILLARY CUTOFFS
7.1
Provision of Sand Blanket
Sand blanket of adequate thickness over the full width of embankment is recommended
as an effective capillary cutoff. The thickness of the sand blanket needed to intercept
capillary action depends on the particle size of sand and may be determined from the following
formula:
t
=
where
t
=
thickness of sand layer in cm
2fifi X
.
-
.
•
d
=
mean particle diameter in mm
Qf^
=
aperture size of sieve (mm) through which the fraction passes
=
aperture size of sieve (mm) on which the fraction is retained.
The sand shall be compacted
after adding
sufficient moisture to permit easy
rolling.
Alternatively,
it can be compacted dry
if the facility of vibratory roller is available.
7.2
Some of the Other Capillary Cutoffs
7.2.1
High density polyethylene (HOPE) sheet
-
Providing a High Density Polyethylene sheet, manufactured from HOPE
resins, duly
contrasted, that comply with the most rigorous requirements established for their use. The

7.2.2
Provision of drainage composite
Prefabricated drainage composite (plastic spacer encased between impermeable layer of
low density polyethylene Geomembrane and Non-woven geotextile) of adequate thickness
over the full width of embankment is recommended as a capillary cutoff. This will avoid the
additional sand blanket, which is generally provided in any other method of capillary cutoff.

GUIDELINES/REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR SOME
SPECIFIC PROBLEMS
8.1
Existing Roads on Low Embankments and Subgrade within Capillary
Fringe
Such roads get frequently damaged whenever water stands in the adjoining ground. For long
term maintenance free pavement,
it is suggested that subgrade of the pavement should be
23

IRC:34-2011
raised as mentioned in para 4.2. In case there are difficulties in raising the embankment, the
level of sub soil, should be lowered as brought out in para 4.5. Schematic arrangement for
providing subsurface drains in low height embankment is shown in Fig. 4.5.2.5.
8.2
Addition of New Carriageway to the Existing Carriage on Low Embankment
Fig. 8.2
Water falling in the sloping central verge needs to be collected and disposed off by drainage
system consisting of water inlet chamber, open drains and hume pipe culvert (below the
existing embankment).

8.3
Drainage of Water from Road in Cutting
Pavements of such roads gets affected by water table of adjoining high bunds. To lower the
level of underground water, there is generally a need to provide aggregate drains on either
side of road as shown is Fig.8.3. Subsurface drains below V-shaped drain are effective in
lowering water table. For specifications of aggregate drains refer Tabie 4.5,2.5.

8.4
Hill Roads with Phreatic Lines Cutting the Bottom
of
Hill Slope
Fig. 8.4 (a)
8.4.1
Wetting of slope marked a, b in Fig. 8.4 or water oozing out of pavement is an
indication of high water table on the Hill side. Sub soil hydraulic studies needs to be carried
out to plot the phreatic line. In case the pervious layer is located at shallow depth, the solution
to the problem lies in lowering the phreatic line well below the pavement by providing on
Hill side, subsurface drain as shown in Fig. 8.4 (a). V-shaped drain for storm water on
hill
side should be provided. The water so intercepted in the drains may be suitably disposed
off.
8.4.2
For pervious layer located at a depth where
it is not practical to provide vertical
subsurface drain as shown in Fig. 8.4 (a), horizontal perforated pipes into the hill side, and
at the face of hill slope breast wall in dry rubble stone masonry should be provided. Behind
the breast wall granular filter should be conssdered. Alternatively free draining wire crate
wall/Gabion (machine made woven wire crate of wire dia 2.7 mm as per IRC:56-2010)
retaining wall should be provided. The perforated pipes may project outside the breast
wall so that seepage water can be collected
directly
in the open
longitudinal
drain.
Concrete caping
at pipes shown
in
Fig. 8.4 (c) shall be provided. For details
refer
to Fig. 8.4 (b) and 8.4 (c).

8.5
River/Canal Running on One Side of the Road
Phreatic line should be below the pavement on bund road. For lowering the phreatic line
(if
it
affects the subgrade) sub-surface drain towards the river/canal as shown in Fig. 8.5 can be
considered. The seepage water so collected
in drain should be suitably disposed
off.
In
case of single lane carriageway, camber should be opposite to river side.

In Hill Roads at Bends/Hair Pin Bends
8.6.1
Hill roads at bends get damaged due to flow of water from the hills. At such bends
after extra widening paved shoulder with cement concrete paver block/stone set in
1 m width
on
hill side can be considered.
8.6.2
At bend locations,
rigid pavement
in general performs better as compared to
granular pavement with bituminous wearing coat.
8.7
Drainage of Land Between Road and Rail Track
8.7.1
If sufficient land
is available between road and
rail track, for disposal of storm
water, open drain/underground sewers should be provided. These open drain/underground
sewers need to be connected to suitable outfall.
8.7.2
In case there are
difficulties
in providing open/underground drain and water
stagnates between (A) and (B) shown in Fig. 8.7, at such locations where water table is low,
storm water can be discharged into the underground aquifer by providing vertical drains
shown in Fig. 4.3. Alternatively aggregate drain/french drain suitably connected to outfall
can be considered.

8.8
Drainage of Area with Habitation on Either Side of Road
i)
Raise the sub grade as suggested in para 4.2. In case
it is not economically
viable to raise the subgrade then underground sewer for disposal of storm
water should be considered. Stone set pavement performs very well in such
areas as mentioned in para 5.3.
8.9
Road Embankments which get Overtopped by Flood Water at High
Velocity
^
Whenever flood water is overtopping an embankment, at such location, possibility of providing
a bridge should be considered. Till such time bridge/cross drainage structures is constructed,
the width of pavement may be increased (for dispersal of traffic load on a wider area) and
the embankment suitably treated to withstand the effect of overtopping of flood waters. The
pavement width at such location should be two lanes with paved shoulders. For passing the
water over topping the embankment, downstream side slope of embankment may have to
be covered with cement concrete. On upstream side of embankment dry stone pitching may
be provided for protection against erosion as per IRC:89.
If stones of suitable size and weight
are not available,
alternatively mattress (machine made woven wire crate as per
IRC:56-2010) filled with small stones over a layer of filter geotextile or suitable filter layer
may be provided. For dissipation of energy, water trough and details of treatment to the
embankment are covered in Fig. 5.1. Pavement to be provided in embankment is covered
in para 5.2.
The solutions as recommended in para 8.1 to 8.9 are for guidance purpose and combination
of solutions can be adopted as per site requirements. For site specific design
for
recommendation made in para 8.1 to 8.9, service of specialist shall be taken. For design of
drainage following guidelines may be referred for further details
