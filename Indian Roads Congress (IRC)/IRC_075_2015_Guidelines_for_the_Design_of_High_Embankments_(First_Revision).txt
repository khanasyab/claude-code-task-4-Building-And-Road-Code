Guidelines for the Design of
High Embankments
 
INTRODUCTION
IRC:75, “Guidelines for the Design of High Embankments” has been prepared to assist 
technical personnel in Highway engineering profession possessing a basic knowledge of 
Geotechnical Engineering to solve numerical problems of embankment design and to identify 
problems which will call for services of Geotechnical specialists. These will be of special 
interest and use to Engineers who have to build embankments in routine circumstances.
The guidelines deal with a wide spectrum of issues including general design considerations, 
sub surface and borrow area investigations, laboratory testing , stability analysis, settlement 
computation , quality control , construction alternatives, instrumentation etc. Detailed design 
procedures that are easily available in text books are not repeated. Earth Embankments are 
included but not embankments consisting of rock- fill.
IRC:75 was first published in 1979. Considering the new concepts developed in design of high 
embankments since the earlier publication it was decided to revise the design guidelines. A 
sub group was constituted by H4 committee with experts in the field of Road Embankment 
design .The convener of the subgroup was Mr. P.J. Rao, other members were, Mr. Sudhir 
Mathur , Mr. Guru Vittal, Ms.Minimol Korulla, Ms. Atasi Das , Mr. Saurabh Vyas , Mr. Atanu 
Adhikari and Ms. Anusha Nandavaram. After many deliberations in H-4 committee on the 
modifications incorporated in IRC:75 clauses, the draft document was submitted to HSS 
committee and the same was discussed during the meeting on 12th January 2015. The HSS 
committee recommended to place the document in council conducted in Bhubaneswar on 19th 
January 2015 with few suggestions for modifications. The subgroup modified the document 
as per the HSS recommendations and submitted the document to Council. On 19th January 
2015, the document was approved by the council for printing.
The composition of the H-4 Committee is as given below:

Chapter-1
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
1.1	
Introduction
A structure of earth, gravel, light-weight material, etc. raised to prevent water from overflowing 
a level tract of land and to carry a roadway is called an embankment. For the purpose of 
guidelines, the terminology “high embankment” refers to a raised structure of height 6 m and 
above built for the purpose of road transportation. It consists of a series of compacted layers 
or lifts of suitable material placed on top of each other until the level of the subgrade surface 
is reached. The subgrade surface is the top of the embankment and the surface upon which 
the sub-base, base and pavement layers are placed.
Though the guidelines specifically indicates “high embankments” as those exceeding 6 m in 
height, embankments of any height less than 6 m founded on soft/compressible and/or loose 
strata are also considered as high embankments here. Design methodologies discussed 
herein apply for such cases also.
High embankments within the road networks are mostly joining to various types of structures 
such as bridges, vehicular/pedestrian underpasses, etc. apart from the requirement of 
geometric alignment due to right-of-way constraints, subsoil issues, etc.  
1.2	
General Considerations in Design
1.2.1	
Most problems of embankment design and construction can be divided into three 
categories:
	
a)	
Routine cases such as embankments constructed over firm or reasonably 
favourable ground, using sand, gravel and other approved suitable fill 
materials.
	
b)	
Special cases where the difficult ground extends over a limited length; soft 
foundation layer/loose stratum exist for a shallow depth; or the embankment 
fill material is relatively un-favorable such as clays or organic material.
	
c)	
Exceptional cases in which embankments are routed over long distances on 
marine clays, tidal swamps, peats, creeks, floodplains, etc., where  conditions 
could be critical in causing instability, and post-construction settlement might 
assume serious proportions and/or strata is expansive in nature exhibiting 
swelling characteristics/liquefaction potential due to the occurrence of loose 
soil at or up to deeper depths.
1.2.2	
In all the above situations, failure of embankments generally takes place by one of 
the following modes:
	
i) 	
Slip circle failure through the slope or through slope and base;



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
4
	
ii) 	
Block sliding over weak soil strata in the foundation;
	
iii) 	
Plastic squeezing;  
	
iv) 	 Liquefaction induced failure of embankment and foundation soil;
	
v) 	
Excessive and uneven settlement of embankment and foundation soil;
	
vi) 	 Erosion of embankment;
	
vii) 	 Instability and scouring in vicinity to water bodies/rivers/ponds;
	
viii) 	 Collapse due to inadequate drainage;
	
ix) 	 Overtopping and subsequent washout by flood water.
A design cannot be considered as complete unless safety against failure by all the above 
modes is ensured. However, before actually embarking on design of the embankment, a 
designer must give due consideration to “engineering” and “economic” factors involved in 
design.
1.3	
Engineering Consideration in Design 
1.3.1	
Each earth embankment is unique by itself since engineering considerations which 
determine the design of embankments are different for each situation. Some of the specific 
engineering considerations are:
i) 	
Foundation conditions
Foundation conditions differ from site to site. The nature of the foundation material has a 
significant influence on the design of the embankment. For example, embankments resting 
on hard or favorable ground need to be analyzed essentially for slope failure. On the other 
hand, embankments resting on soft ground have to be analyzed not merely for slope stability, 
but also for base stability and anticipated settlement.
Also, if a thick layer of weak clay is sandwiched between stronger layers; a wedge failure 
across the weak layer will be more likely and design procedure must be tailored accordingly. 
An inclined hard stratum at shallow depth may indicate slippage along the stratum slope.
It is, therefore, essential that the soil profile below a proposed embankment should be 
investigated carefully and the physical and engineering properties of the subsoil be determined 
properly by in-situ and/or laboratory tests. 
In case of embankments, bearing capacity problems assume significance if the embankment 
is resting on soft clay. The consideration for evaluating bearing capacity and settlement has 
been dealt with in the publication IRC:113 “Guidelines for the Design and Construction of 
Geosynthetic Reinforced Embankments on Soft Sub-soils”.
ii)	
Materials available at site
A highway embankment, like all civil engineering structures is founded on earth. The only 
difference is that the structure also consists of earth fill. While building embankments, 
one has to consider, for economic reasons to use fill material available near the site. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015
5
variables that the designer can control are the water content of fill material during compaction, 
the amount of compaction, rate of loading and type of compaction. Choice of placement 
variables determines the density and structure of the compacted fill and in turn determines 
the engineering properties of the compacted fill. 
iii)	
Other considerations
In addition to the above, several other parameters like climatic conditions, seismic effect, 
nature of loads, acceptable performance criterion such as global stability, settlements, 
bearing capacity and the time available for construction should be considered for design.  
1.3.2	
When designing a highway embankment over difficult foundation conditions, the 
designer may have to consider one or more of the following solutions:
	
•	
Ground Improvement by replacement of poor sub soil 
	
•	
Provision of proper surface and subsurface drainage 
	
•	
Provision of suitable erosion control measures 
	
•	
Construction of embankment with berms 
	
•	
Use of light weight material for subsoil/fill material for embankment 
construction 
	
•	
Chemical stabilization  
	
•	
Stage construction
	
•	
Preloading
	
•	
Sub soil stabilization by Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVDs) or stone 
columns 
	
•	
Basal reinforcement or Basal mattress 
	
•	
Dynamic compaction 
	
•	
Displacement of weak subsoil by surcharge weight or blasting 
	
•	
Embankment fill supported on piles 
	
•	
Pile Supported basal reinforced embankments 
	
•	
Mitigation measures for expansive soil with swelling characteristics 
	
•	
Mitigation measures for liquefiable soils
If one or more of the above solutions do not make the high embankment construction viable, 
then alternatives such as viaducts, relocation of alignment, etc. may be considered.
1.3.3	
The different solutions should be evaluated objectively at the planning stage 
itself keeping in view the construction and maintenance costs, ecological and environmental 
effects, time available for construction, availability of fill soil and the right of way limitations. 
This can be possible only if the initial investigations recognize the various possibilities and 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
6
consider all the pros and cons before a final decision has been taken about the final route 
alignment.
1.4	
In the present guidelines, attempt has been made to address the designer’s 
queries in a concise form within the chapters themselves. 
Chapter 2:	
“Geotechnical Investigations” provides guidance on the selection of the field 
and laboratory investigations including geophysical investigations with advantages and 
limitations, which are necessary and appropriate for the design and construction of the high 
embankment. 
Chapter 3:	
“Stability Analysis and Seismic Considerations” focuses on slope stability 
analyses taking into account earthquake forces and evaluation for liquefaction potential and 
corresponding design inputs and related considerations.
Chapter 4:	
“Settlement Analysis” addresses design inputs and major considerations for 
computation of settlement.
Chapter 5:	
“Ground Improvement” covers various methods in brief. 
Chapter 6:	
“Instrumentation and Monitoring of Embankment” on soft soil deals with the 
instrumentation techniques available for the monitoring of embankment constructed on soft 
foundation strata. 
1.5	
Complete design and construction of highway embankment requires supplementary 
inputs as indicated below. For details of these requirements reference may be made to the 
documents mentioned therein.
	
•	
Selection and testing of fill materials, compaction and quality control-Ref. 
MORTH: Specifications for Roads and Bridge works Section 900
	
•	
Erosion control of slopes covered in IRC:56 “Recommended Practices for 
Treatment of Embankment and Roadside Slopes for Erosion Control” (First 
Revision). Also refer MORTH Section 300 
	
•	
IRC:34 “Recommendations for Road Construction in Areas Affected by Water 
Logging, Flooding and/or Salt Infestation”.
	
•	
IRC:SP:42 “Guidelines on Road Drainage”. 
1.6	
Unconventional materials beyond the range specified by MORTH are 
increasingly coming into use, during the past few years, in the construction of highway 
embankments. Such materials include waste of mines of different ores and also fly ash from 
different thermal power plants etc., in all such cases it is desirable to take the advice of 
Geotechnical Engineer.

Chapter 2
GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS
2.0	
This chapter contains information related to soil exploration planning, methods and 
techniques including use of test pits, test borings, penetrometers and geophysical methods. 
Also presented is information on methods of sampling, measuring in situ properties of soil 
and rock, and field measurements. This chapter also covers laboratory test procedures, 
typical test properties, and the application of test results to design and construction of high 
embankments.
2.1	
Planning For Field Investigations 
The initial phase of field investigations shall consist of detailed review of project details, 
geological conditions at the site and in its general environs. This should include a desk study 
of available data including aerial photography, and field reconnaissance. The information 
obtained should encompass the following and should be used as a guide in planning the 
exploration.
Project details
	
•	
Plan and profile drawing of the project along with general cross-sections.
	
•	
The maximum height of the embankment.
Site specific details
	
•	
The nature, thickness and variation of soil strata along length of embankment.
	
•	
Procuring representative samples for assessing the physical properties of 
the soil strata encountered.
	
•	
The seasonal variations in ground water table and their possible effects on 
the soil parameters 
	
•	
Properties including range of values of shear strength and compressibility of 
soil layers.
2.2	
Exploration Phases 
Project geotechnical exploration can generally have four phases: 
	
i)	
Reconnaissance/feasibility exploration; 
	
ii)	
Preliminary exploration;  
	
iii)	
Detailed/final exploration; and
	
iv)	
Construction/post construction phases. 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
8
Additional exploration may be required during construction. Frequently, all preconstruction 
phases are combined into a single exploration effort.
Further, the geotechnical exploration includes embankment foundation or subsurface 
investigation, embankment fill materials or soils and materials investigation.
i)	
Reconnaissance/feasibility
Reconnaissance includes a review of available topographic and geologic information, aerial 
photographs, data from previous investigations, and site examination. Geophysical methods 
are applicable in special cases. Reconnaissance/feasibility frequently reveal difficulties which 
may be expected later in exploration phases and assists in determining the type, number and 
locations of borings. 
ii)	
Preliminary exploration 
This may include borings to recover samples for identification tests only.
iii)	
Detailed exploration 
This phase normally includes borings, disturbed and undisturbed sampling for laboratory 
testing, standard penetration resistances, and other in situ measurements. At critical sites it 
may also include test pits, piezometer measurements, permeability test, other in-situ tests 
like pressure meter etc.
iv)	
Construction/post construction phases 
Further evaluation of embankment foundation conditions may be required during the 
construction phase. Monitoring of the site or structure may be necessary throughout the 
construction and post construction phases.
2.3	
Embankment Foundation or Subsurface Investigation
The objective of subsurface investigation is to determine the suitability of the soil or rock 
for the embankment foundation. Soil borings are the most common method of subsurface 
exploration in the field. Guidance may be taken from the following Codal provisions.
	
i)	
IS 1892 – Code of Practice for Subsurface Investigation for Foundations may 
be utilized for guidance regarding investigation and collection of data.
	
ii)	
Tests on soils shall be conducted in accordance with the relevant part of IS 
2720 – Methods of Test for Soils. The tests on undisturbed samples shall 
be conducted as far as possible at simulated field conditions to get realistic 
values.
	
iii)	
IS 1498 – Classification and Identification of Soils for General Engineering 
Purposes. May be referred to the extent required for the purpose of 
embankment design. The data from subsoil investigation shall be plotted in 
a tabular form along with the subsoil profile.

A.	
Boring methods. 
A common method of exploring sub surface conditions is by drilling exploratory borings along 
the proposed alignment. Shallow borings can be made with light weight hand operated augers 
while the deep borings can be made by adopting power driven rotary drilling or wash boring 
or percussion drilling depending on the sub soil conditions and requirements. The diameter 
of casing shall not be less than 150 mm diameter for boring up to the level of rock
B.	
Boring depth. 
The boring depth is controlled to a great degree by the characteristics and sequence of the 
subsurface materials encountered. 
C.	
Boring layout. 
As a general guideline, for bridge approaches, where the extent of the high embankment 
is limited to 1 km or less, a minimum of three boreholes shall be drilled; where the extent 
is more than 1 km, one borehole per kilometer shall suffice in general conditions. For soft/
incompressible and/or loose subsurface (as noted in Tables 2.1 and 2.2), the intermediate 
spacing of boreholes within a kilometer shall be left to the judgment of the Engineer-in-
charge. 
General guidelines while deciding on the boring layout are given below: 
	
1)	
Provide three borings in staggered way (BH1, BH2 and BH3 in Fig. 2.1) 
across the Critical section. Where detailed settlement, stability, or seepage 
analyses are required, include a minimum of two borings to obtain undisturbed 
samples of critical section for cohesive soil. Undisturbed samples may be 
collected as required for the tests
	
2)	
Boreholes to be so located to obtain geological profile in transverse direction. 
For design of high embankment the following general layout shall be followed additionally 
where subsoil conditions differ, criteria for depth of boring are given in general termination 
criteria.

Termination Criteria:
Depth of borehole shall normally be twice the height of embankment from the existing ground 
level. The boreholes shall be terminated at a lesser depth if rock is encountered or refusal 
(N-value > 50) is met for two consecutive values of SPT conducted at an interval of 1.5 m. 
Further guidelines are provided below on site investigation while deciding on the termination 
depth of the boring. 
	
i)	
The soil investigation shall start from 0.5 m depth from existing ground 
level. This will enable to collect soil samples from top and determine their 
properties.
	
ii)	
Unsuitable Foundation Strata:  All borings shall extend through unsuitable 
foundation strata, such as unconsolidated fill; peat; highly organic materials; 
soft, fine-grained soils; and loose, coarse-grained soils to reach hard or 
compact materials of suitable bearing capacity, which may extend to a depth 
beyond twice the height of embankment
	
iii)	
Fine-Grained Strata: Extend borings in potentially compressible fine-
grained strata of great thickness to a depth where stress from superposed 
load is low that consolidation of lower layers will not significantly influence 
surface settlement.
	
iv)	
Compact Soils: Where stiff or compact soils are encountered at shallow 
depths, extend boring(s) through this material to a depth where the presence 
of an underlying weaker stratum cannot affect stability or settlement.
Method of Sampling From Borings
The size of the bores shall be chosen so that samples as required for the various types of 
tests are obtained. The method of taking samples shall be as given in IS 1892 and IS 2132. 
The tests on the samples shall be conducted as per relevant part of IS 2720.
The number and type of samples to be collected/recovered depend on the stratification and 
material encountered. 
	
a)	
Disturbed samples: These are the hand, auger and wash samples and 
are primarily used for identification and soil classification tests. Take 
representative disturbed samples at vertical intervals of not less than 1.5 m 
and at every change in strata. 
	
b)	
Undisturbed samples: These are collected in thin walled (also called 
Shelby tube) sampling tube and are taken primarily for laboratory strength 
and compressibility tests and in those cases where the in-place properties 
of the soil must be studied. Normally, sampling (disturbed and undisturbed) 
shall be carried out alternatively at an interval of 1.5 m or change of strata 
whichever is earlier.

Points to be noted for soil sampling:
	
•	
Undisturbed samples should comply with the following criteria: they should 
contain no visible distortion of strata, or cracks or softening of materials; 
specific recovery ratio (length of undisturbed sample recovered divided by 
length of sampling push) should exceed 95 percent; and they should be 
taken with a sampler with an area ratio (annular cross-sectional area of 
sampling tube divided by full area of outside diameter of sampler) less than 
15 percent.
	
•	
Undisturbed samples in cohesive soil strata may be obtained such a way 
that there is at least one representative undisturbed sample in each boring 
for each 3 m depth. 
	
•	
Relatively undisturbed cohesive and C-φ sample can be recovered by using 
Open tube thin walled sampler (IS: 2132). Detailed specifications of the 
sampler can be obtained from IS: 11594.  
Additional cautions include the following:
	
1) 	
Caving: Use casing or viscous drilling fluid to advance borehole, if there is 
danger of caving. If groundwater measurements are planned, drilling fluid 
should be of the revert type.
	
2) 	
Above Groundwater Table: When sampling above groundwater table, 
borehole shall be maintained dry whenever possible.
	
3)	
Below Groundwater Table: When sampling below groundwater table, 
borehole shall be maintained full of water or drilling fluid during cleanout, 
during sampling and sample withdrawal, and while removing cleanout tools. 
Where continuous samples are required, casing should remain full for the 
entire drilling and sampling operation.
	
4) 	
Soft or Loose Soil:  Collection of sample in the same sampling tube shall 
be avoided, when the sample is collected from a soft or loose soil directly 
below a stiff or compact soil in the same tube should be avoided. Discontinue 
driving of sample tube when a sudden decrease in resistance occurs.
2.3.1	
Characterization of Sub-soil (Embankment Foundation) by In-situ Tests:
Several in-situ tests define the sub-soil and obtain direct measurements of soil properties 
and geotechnical parameters. The common tests include: Standard Penetration (SPT), Static 
Cone Penetration Test (SCPT), Pressuremeter Test (PMT), and Vane Shear Test (VST). 
Each test applies different loading schemes to measure the corresponding soil response in 
an attempt to evaluate material characteristics, such as strength and/or stiffness. Fig. 2.2 
depicts these various devices. Brief descriptions of these tests are given in the subsequent 
sections and details are provided in relevant standards.

2.3.1.1	
Penetration resistance tests
The most common test is the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) which measures resistance 
to the penetration of a standard sampler in borings. The method is rapid and when tests are 
properly conducted in the field, they yield useful data, although there are many factors which 
can affect the results. A more controlled test is the cone penetrometer test in which a cone 
shaped tip is jacked from the surface of the ground to provide a continuous resistance record.
i)	
Standard Penetration Test (S.P.T) (IS: 2131). 
This test provides an indirect measure of shear strength and is especially suitable when 
undistributed samples cannot be extracted from cohesion less strata. Detailed test procedure 
and interpretation of SPT N–value can be referred from IS 2131.
ii)	
Static Cone Penetration Test (SCPT) (IS: 4968).
This field test enables continuous exploration throughout the stratum. SCPT is advantageous 
as compared to SPT especially in soils where in-situ soil density is likely to alter due to boring 
process. Detailed method is explained in IS: 4968.
Static Cone Penetration Test equipment, hydraulically operated is usually capable of 
conducting test up to 30 m depth as per site conditions.
The SPT N-value and SCPT-value obtained from the field exploration (SPT and SCPT tests 
respectively) provides a ready indication of the relative firmness of the strata and broad 
correlations are included in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.

2.3.1.2	
In-Situ vane shear test (IS: 4434)
Vane shear apparatus is used for measuring the undrained shearing resistance and the 
sensitivity of the soft deposits of clay. Such tests are generally carried out in the bore hole after 
extracting an undisturbed sample. Equipment is also available with which vane shear test 
may be run on soft soils without making boring. If the soil contains thin layers or laminations 
of sand or dense silt, the results obtained by vane shear test may be misleading.
2.3.1.3	
Pressuremeter test (ASTM D4719)
Pressure meter test is an in-situ test conducted in a size NX borehole (76 mm). It was 
developed to measure the strength and deformability of soil and rock.  The test is conducted 
in a pre bored hole with a diameter that is between 1.03 and 1.2 times the nominal diameter 
of the probe.
2.3.1.4	
Flat Dilatometer test (DMT) (ASTM D6635)
In addition to the listed methods, measurements can also be made in the field by using 
the Flat Dilatometer Test (DMT) wherein the dilatometer blade is advanced into the ground 
using a cone penetrometer or with a drill rig at a rate of 2cm/sec. The results obtained can 
be interpreted in terms of various soil parameters for application in various fields of civil 
engineering like computing settlement of shallow foundation, axially loaded pile, laterally 
loaded pile and pile groups, detection of slip surfaces in over consolidated clay slopes and 
determining liquefaction susceptibility at a particular site.

2.3.1.5	
Geophysical exploration (IS: 1892)
Geophysical testing can be used as part of the initial site exploration to provide supplementary 
information to the data collected by other means (i.e., borings, test pits, geologic surveys, 
etc.). Geophysical testing can be used for establishing stratification of subsurface materials, 
the profile of the top of bedrock, the depth of groundwater, the boundaries of various types 
of soil deposits, the presence and depth of voids, buried pipes, and existing foundations. 
However, data from geophysical testing should always be correlated with information from 
the direct methods of exploration already discussed.
2.3.1.5.1	 Types of geophysical tests
There are different types of geophysical in-situ tests that can be used to obtain stratigraphic 
information from which engineering properties can be estimated. Annexure 2.3 provides 
a summary of the various geophysical methods that are currently in practice and can be 
used to economic advantage. A general discussion regarding the major test methods listed 
in Annexure 2.3 is presented below, with particular emphasis on potential applications to 
highway engineering.
i)	
Seismic methods
These methods are becoming increasingly popular for geotechnical engineering practice 
because they have the potential to provide data regarding the compression and shear wave 
velocities of the subsurface materials. The shear wave velocity is directly related to small-
strain material stiffness which in turn is often correlated to compressive strength and soil/
rock type. These techniques are often used for assessing the vertical stiffness profile in a 
soil deposit and for assessing the location at depth of the interface between soil and rock. 
Seismic refraction method involves measurement of time of arrival of the initial ground motion 
generated by the energy source while the seismic reflection method involves measurement 
of the energy arrival after the initial ground motion.
ii)	
Electrical Resistivity methods
These methods are usually used to locate voids or locally distinct materials. Electrical 
resistivity methods provide qualitative information only and are usually part of a two- or three-
phased exploration program.
iii)	
Gravity and Magnetic methods
These methods are similar to electrical methods, except that they rely on correlations between 
the potential gravitational and/or magnetic influence of voids and subsurface anomalies and 
measured differences in the earth’s micro-gravitational and/or magnetic fields, rather than on 
changes in electrical fields. These methods provide measurements at specific points unlike 
seismic and electrical methods that provide measurements over large areas.
iv)	
Borehole methods
Downhole geophysical methods provide reliable indications of a wide range of soil properties. 
For example, downhole/crosshole methods provide reliable measures of shear wave velocity. 



======================================================================

IRC:75-2015

As indicated previously, shear wave velocity is directly related to small-strain stiffness and is 
correlated to strength and soil/rock type. Although downhole logging methods have seen little 
use in highway construction, they have been the mainstay for deep geologic characterization 
in oil exploration. The principal advantage of downhole logging is the ability to obtain several 
different geophysical tests/indicators by “stringing” these tools together in a deep borehole.
Near surface nuclear methods have been used for several years for compaction control of 
fills in the field. Through careful calibration, it is possible to assess the moisture content and 
density of compacted soils reliably. These methods have been widely adopted as reliable 
quantitative methods
2.3.1.5.2	 Advantages and limitations of geophysical tests
As with the other methods of exploration, geophysical testing offers some advantages and 
some limitations that should be considered before these techniques are recommended for a 
specific application. These are summarized as follows:
2.3.1.5.2.1 Advantages of geophysical tests
	
i)	
Many geophysical tests are non-invasive. Therefore, such tests offer 
significant benefits in cases where conventional drilling, testing, and sampling 
are difficult (e.g., deposits of gravel, talus deposits, etc.) or where potentially 
contaminated soils may occur in the subsurface.
	
ii)	
In general, geophysical testing can cover a relatively large geographical area 
thereby providing the opportunity to characterize large areas with relatively 
few tests. Geophysical testing is particularly well-suited to projects that have 
large longitudinal extent such as new highway construction.
	
iii)	
Geophysical measurements are used to assess the properties of soil and 
rock at very small strains.
2.3.1.5.2.2 Limitations of geophysical tests
	
i)	
Most methods work best for situations in which there is a large difference in 
the property being measured between adjacent subsurface units. In seismic 
methods, it is difficult to develop good stratigraphic profiling if the general 
stratigraphy consists of hard material overlying soft material.
	
ii)	
Each geophysical method has limitations that may be associated with 
equipment, signal noise, unfavorable site and subsurface conditions, and 
processing constraints.
	
iii)	
Results can be non-unique and are generally interpreted qualitatively. 
Therefore useful results can be obtained only through analyses performed 
by a geotechnical specialist experienced with the particular testing method.
	
iv)	
Specialized and more electronically sophisticated equipment is required 
as compared to the more conventional subsurface exploration tools thus 
rendering it expensive in the Indian scenario.

2.3.1.5.2.3 Examples of uses of geophysical tests
The following are a few examples where geophysical testing could be used on highway 
projects to compliment conventional exploration.
	
i)	
Highly Variable Subsurface Conditions: In several geologic settings, the 
subsurface conditions along a transportation corridor may be expected to 
be variable. This variability could be from underlying karsts development 
above limestone; alluvial deposits, including buried terrace gravels, across 
a wide floodplain; buried boulders in a talus slope, etc. For these cases, 
conventional exploration techniques may be very difficult and if “refusal” 
is encountered at certain depth, there is a strong likelihood that different 
materials could underlie the hard strata region. Development of a preliminary 
subsurface characterization profile by using geophysical testing could prove 
advantageous in designing future focused explorations.
	
ii)	
Regional Studies: Along a transportation corridor it may be necessary to 
assess the depth to (and through) rippable rock or highly cemented caliche. 
Alternative alignments may or may not be possible, but the cost implications 
may be significant. Therefore, it is important to obtain a profile related to 
rock/soil stiffness. Geophysical testing is a logical consideration for this 
application as a precursor to invasive explorations.
	
iii)	
Settlement Sensitive Structures: The prior two examples related to cases 
where the geophysical testing served as the front-end of a multi-phase 
project. In the case where a settlement-sensitive structure is to be founded 
on deposits of sands, knowledge of the in-situ modulus of the sand deposit 
is critical. After the characteristics of the site are assessed, it may be helpful 
to quantify the deformation modulus by the use of geophysical testing at the 
specific foundation site.
2.3.2	
Characterization of Sub-soil by Laboratory Tests:
Suitable selection of appropriate laboratory tests on the collected samples is of utmost 
importance. The following tests will normally be included in the test schedule.

2.4	
Embankment Fill Material Investigation
For reaches involving new embankment construction, it is important to ensure that (a) 
each layer of embankment is constructed with select materials of approved borrow areas 
in layers of specified thickness and that necessary compaction is achieved before placing 
the subsequent layer; (b) suitable construction methodology is adopted on expansive clay 
stretches; and (c) all sources of materials (being used in embankments) have undergone full 
range of tests for compliance as per specifications.
2.4.1	
Field Investigation
Detailed borrow material survey shall be conducted at closest lead distances, identify select 
ones at an interval of 5 km on both sides of the alignment, then dig test/trial pits for sample 
testing for suitability. Normally, test pits are dug up to 1 m to 2 m depth and disturbed samples 
are taken for testing.  
2.4.2	
Laboratory Tests
There are three basic requirements for a compacted embankment, namely:
	
a)	
Adequate shear strength.
	
b)	
Good drainability 
	
c)	
Limited settlement within the body of the embankment.

*CBR tests usually get conducted at 3 different energy levels corresponding to 10, 30 and 
65 blows. During tests, normally 3 specimens of about 7 kg are compacted, so that their 
compacted densities may range from 95% to 100%. 
2.5

 Annexure 2.2
Important Instructions for Obtaining Undisturbed Samples:
a)	
When sampling above ground water table, maintain bore hole dry, whenever 
possible. When sampling below ground water table, maintain bore hole full of 
water or drilling fluid during cleaning out, sampling, sample withdrawal and while 
removing clean out tools. If necessary, this should be accomplished by positive 
inflow at ground surface.
b)	
Cleaning of bore hole
	
i)	
Use jet auger that deflects the flow of water or drilling fluid upward. Downward 
nor sideward jetting is not permitted when cleaning below casing. Cleaning 
with jet bits that direct the flow downward or sideward is permitted within 
the casing but should not be done within four inches of the intended top 
of samples. The last 100 mm are cleaned out with a jet auger that deflects 
water or drilling fluid upward.
	
ii)	
When casing is extruded to sample depth, all soil must be cleaned out up 
to the casing trip at least and preferably 100 mm below the trip. Where 
continuous samples are taken, allow for 100 mm when determining final 
depth of casing before sampling. Coarse washed material must be removed 
from bore holes before sampling and the hole should be cleaned so that soil 
at the intended top of the sample is as nearly undisturbed as possible.
c)	
Sample retrieval
Take the sample as soon as possible after cleaning the hole. Cleaning of the hole should not 
be attempted if sampling is to be delayed.
d)	
Sampling operation
	
i)	
Preparation: Sampler and tube must be properly cleaned with vents, valves, 
piston packing, etc. checked for proper placement and function.
	
ii)	
Lowering Tube: Lower sampler slowly and carefully to bottom of hole without 
dropping. When encountering water table while lowering the sampler, 
precaution must be taken with samplers containing piston rod extensions to 
prevent an upward rise of the piston.
	
iii)	
Securing Piston Rods: Provide piston extension rods with a positive locking 
device at ground surface, and securely lock piston rods before sampling.
	
iv)	
Penetration: force the sample tube past the locked piston by uninterrupted 
hydraulic pushing. Do not rotate sample tube during downward movement.


IRC:75-2015
23
	
v)	
Length of penetration: Length of sample penetration should never exceed 
length of sampler. For sampling tube 20 mm ID (with internal diameter), 
penetration should be exceeded 10 times ID for cohesionless soils and 15 
times ID cohesive soils.
	
vi)	
Withdrawal: After penetration allow sampler to sit for at least 10 Min. before 
withdrawal. Then rotate sample tube two to three revolutions and withdraw 
slowly using moderate up ward pull on drill rod avoiding sudden acceleration, 
shock, or vibration.
	
vii)	
Tube Removal: After withdrawing the sampler from the hole, take care not 
to drop it on the ground. Remove the tube from the sampler head without 
disturbing the sample.
e)	
Sample preservation: 
The procedure for sample preservation is as follows.
	
i)	
Handling: Handle sample tubes with extreme care at all times after removal 
from borehole.
	
ii)	
Sealing: Before sealing, remove any disturbed material from the tube and 
clean tube walls to provide good contact for sealer wax. After waxing the 
ends of the tube, place snugly fitting metal caps at each end tape them to 
the sample tube. Again, immerse the tube ends in wax. When there is an 
annular clearance between the sample and tube that cannot be completely 
sealed, remove the sample from the tube and wax the sample completely in 
a large container. If too great an inside tube clearance is suspected, obtain 
new tubes having a smaller clearance before further samples are taken.
	
iii)	
Identification: Mark sample tubes with boring number, sample number, 
depth, total drive, measured recovery of undisturbed soil before trimming 
and description of soil type at the upper end of the tube.
	
iv)	
Protection: Protect sample from extreme heat and freezing after withdrawal 
from hole and during transportation.
	
v)	
Packing: Pack sample tubes for shipment with sawdust in sturdy boxes.
	
vi)	
Sample Retention: Indefinite storage of samples is not warranted. They 
should normally be retained only until the construction contract is awarded.

Chapter 3
STABILITY ANALYSIS
3.1	
Introduction
Failures may occur slowly or suddenly, and stability analysis is meant to determine whether 
the proposed embankment slope will meet the safety requirements against failure arising 
from shear stress exceeding the tolerable limits. The analysis is generally made for the worst 
conditions which may occur during the service of the embankment. In this task, besides 
knowledge of the analytical method, experience and judgment are essential. 
 Stability of high embankment depends on various factors like foundation profile, fill 
material quality, extent of compaction, drainage arrangement both surface and sub-surface, 
and embankment geometry like height of embankment, slope angle, ground profile etc., 
external factors like traffic or earthquake load or presence of any water body by the side 
of the embankment or development of pore water pressure due to infiltration from heavy 
rain. All these parameters and conditions will make significant impact on overall stability of 
the embankment. Hence, it is very important to understand and evaluate these site specific 
conditions and interpretation of design parameters correctly before proceeding with design.
3.2	
Types of Failure
Failure of highway embankments generally occurs in the following modes
a) 	
Failure of an embankment: Embankments fail when a part of the soil mass moves 
in an outward and downward direction. This is often called as slope failure or a 
slide. The term “slide” is also associated with failure of natural slopes. 
	
In the case of embankment failure the mass moving out may include soil in the 
fill only or such movement may include the fill and the natural ground or subsoil. 
Generally speaking, failures occur in rotational mode in soil slopes. Failure surface 
forms an arc of a circle, isolating the failed mass from the rest of the embankment. 
If the failure arc cuts the slope it is called as slope failure, if it meets the toe it 
is called toe failure. If the failure circle goes into the subsoil it is called as base 
failure. Presence of weaker layer may cause a failure surface to take a composite 
shape. Fig. 3.1a & 3.1b shows the failure surfaces discussed above. Generally, 
base failures do not occur if the foundation soil is firm and has an angle of internal 
friction greater than 300.  i.e. if the soil is sandy or gravelly.
	
Long slopes of purely cohesionless soils may fail along planar surfaces. 
b)	
Bearing capacity failure: Embankment may fail in bearing capacity if the soil 
on which it is founded does not have enough shear strength. In this mode 
embankment sinks into the ground causing large vertical settlements as well as 
lateral displacements in the soil adjacent to the toe.

IRC:75-2015

Embankments also experience settlements and sometimes such settlements may occur over 
a long period of time and this process depends on many factors. Excessive settlements 
causes distress and are a cause of concern hence it is necessary that the magnitude and 
rate at which settlements progress is also evaluated.
In this chapter, methods of analysis of failure of embankments are discussed. Settlement 
analysis is dealt with in Chapter 4.

Note: The failure surface is usually tangential to the weak zone

Basic Considerations in Design
There are some basic factors which influence analysis of slope stability problem. Principal 
among these are the choice of method of analysis (i.e. effective stress or total stress method), 
stage of construction for which the analysis is carried out (i.e. short term or long term condition) 
and the proposed factor of safety. Before going into the actual analysis, understanding of 
these factors is important.

3.3.1	
Total and Effective Stress Methods
Analysis of stability can be done either in terms of total stress or effective stress depending 
upon the soil properties, loading conditions and the prevailing stage of construction.
a)	
Total stress method
Stability analysis may be carried out using either by total stress or effective stress method. 
Total stress method is applicable where an embankment is constructed on saturated clays of 
low permeability and no change in water content occurs in the subsoil prior to failure. Shear 
strength in this case may be given as follows
 
τ=cu+σntanφu	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.1
Where cu and φu are called undrained shear parameters. Saturated clays when tested to 
failure under undrained conditions yield shear strength parameter φu =0 and cu = (σ1-σ3)/2. 
This analysis also called φu =0 analysis. This method is applicable to conditions where no 
dissipation of pore water pressures has yet occurred subsequent to loading. With the lapse 
of time the pore water pressure decreases. Under such conditions stability analysis may be 
carried out using total stress method by determining the new value of cu by laboratory or filed 
tests. The above procedure may be repeated at as many time intervals as required in the 
project. The above statements are valid only for fully saturated clays.
b)	
Effective stress method
Effective stress method of analysis takes into account the pore water pressures for the stage 
at which stability is to be analysed. The relationship between shear strength and applied 
normal stress used in such analysis is given by the expression:
 	
τ=c'+(σn-u)tanφ'	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.2
c’ and ø’ are called as effective stress parameters. These parameters have to be determined 
from appropriate type of laboratory tests on soil samples. 
Table 3.2 gives the type of laboratory tests to be carried out for undrained and drained shear 
strength parameters.
Using effective stress parameters, stability of the embankment can be determined any time 
during the life of embankment. Porewater pressures at the desired point of time shall be 
used.
3.3.2	
Porewater Pressure
In making this analysis, the porewater pressure, ‘u’ at any point in the embankment is obtained 
from the expression:
	
u=u0+ Δu		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.3
Where, uo represents the initial value of pore water pressure, and Δu denotes the incremental 
pore water pressure in the soil due to change in stress.



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015

i)	
Porewater pressure (Hydrostatic pressure)
Arises from the presence of free water level within the vicinity of the embankment (uo). The 
value of initial pore water pressure may be obtained from field piezometer measurements. If 
there is seepage through embankment the values may be obtained from flownets. 
ii)	
Hydrostatic excess pressure
Arising from any additional load acting on the free body. The magnitude of such hydrostatic 
excess pressure is a function of load acting as well as properties of the material of the 
embankment. This component of pore water pressure is calculated using the following 
relationship (Skempton, 1954) where A and B are determined from laboratory tests.
	
Δu=B [Δ σ3 + A (Δσ1 - Δ σ3) 	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.4
	
Generally for saturated clays B=1 
Where 	
Δσ1 denotes the incremental total major principal stress
            	
Δσ3 denotes the incremental total minor principal stress
Use of Skempton’s formula involves the use of following steps:
	
a.	
Determine Coefficients A and B from laboratory tests on undisturbed samples
	
b.	
Calculate Δσ1 and Δσ3 at different points in subsoil layer.
For this purpose it is necessary to calculate Δσh,  Δσv  and shear stress at different points, 
using standard charts or formulae. From this stresses Δσ1 and Δσ3 can be calculated 
Since the above procedure is complex, hence it is used in important cases. Generally Δσu is 
equated to Δσv and this is on the safe side.
iii)	
Porewater pressure ratio
Porewater pressure ratio at any depth is defined by the term:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.5
Where u is the pore water pressure, γh= total vertical stress at the same depth, (h is the 
depth of the point in the soil mass below the soil surface). ru can be easily used for estimating 
slope stability from charts.
3.3.3 	
Factor of Safety
The results of the stability analysis are normally expressed in terms of a factor of safety with 
respect to shear strength. The factor of safety is defined as the factor by which the shear 
strength parameters (in terms of effective stress) c’ and tanø’ can be reduced before the 
slope is brought into the state of limiting equilibrium. The shear strength mobilized under 
these conditions is given by the expression
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.6	
       



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
30
Where σn denotes the total stress normal to the potential failure surface and u denotes the 
pore water pressure. The definition is the same as that adopted by Taylor “the factor of safety 
with respect to shear strength”, and is in accordance with that enunciated earlier by Fellinius 
(1927). It has the advantage of being applicable to circular and non circular slip surface alike 
without modifications and operates directly on the relevant strength parameters (Bishop & 
Morgenstern, 1960).
Loading Conditions
Live Load (External Traffic Load) 24 KN/m2 is considered across the width of carriage way
Dead Load: Self weight of embankment and any structures resting on embankments
Static Case: Live Load + Dead Load
Seismic case: 50% Live load + Dead load + seismic load (As per IRC-6)

*Initial factor of safety 1.2 is applicable to situations where there is a gain in shear strength of subsoils due to 
ground improvement methods leading to increase in factor of safety with time. In such cases it is important 
that construction is continuously monitored for changes in pore water pressures, progress of settlements and 
occurrence of lateral deformations.
It should be remembered that maintenance of the design factor of safety in execution will invariably require a 
strict control over rate of construction in order to allow partial dissipation of pore water pressure at stages critical 
from the point of view of stability.
3.3.4	
Short Term and Long-Term Conditions
Two types of slope stability problems occur in clayey soils; short term stability (end of 
construction case) and long term stability. When an embankment is constructed on a clayey 
soil, shearing resistance of the soil is drastically reduced by the development of excess pore 
water pressure during construction. Pore water pressure developed depends on the state 
of stress resulting from the weight of superimposed layer and the drainage conditions. With 
passage of time, porewater pressure is dissipated and soil improves its shearing strength. 
The rate of dissipation of pore water pressure is clearly related to the permeability of the soil. 
The critical period of shear failure in clayey soils is, therefore during construction and shortly 
after the completion of the embankment at which stage full embankment load is acting, but 
pore water pressure may not have completely dissipated. Eventually, the excess pore water 
pressure is dissipated and porewater acquires a state of equilibrium with ground water table, 
generating a steady state flow pattern. This stage is referred to as the long term stability 



======================================================================

IRC:75-2015
31
or steady seepage case. In between there would be an intermediate stage when partial 
dissipation of pore water pressure has occurred and this is important for stage construction 
analysis. In embankments built of and resting on gravels, sands or cohesionless soils, the time 
required for dissipation of excess pore water pressure is very less and as such the stability is 
to be checked for long term condition only which is the same as short term condition.
The type of shear test /shear strength parameters depending on the stability analysis for the 
short term or long term stability is given in Table 3.2

3.3.5 	
Bearing Capacity of Embankments
Where subsoils are competent and have adequate bearing capacity to carry the load of 
the embankment , bearing capacity may be calculated according to the formulae given in 
IS: 6403 “ Code of practice for determination of breaking capacity of shallow foundations” 
	
Qnu= cNc+ q (Nq-1) + 0.5γBNγ                                                            …Eqn. 3.7
Where 	
Qnu is net ultimate bearing capacity
	
c is cohesion, B= base width
	
Nc, Nq and Nγ are the bearing capacity factors which may be obtained from table 
1 of IS: 6403 



======================================================================

Effect of Water Table on Bearing Capacity
Modified bearing capacity formula considering water table effect is
	
	
Qnu= cNc+ q (Nq-1)+ 0.5γBNγW’	
	
	
    	
…Eqn. 3.8
	
a) 	
If the water table is likely to permanently remain at or below a depth of 
(Df + B ) beneath the ground level surrounding the footing then W' = I.
	
b) 	
If the water table is located at a depth Df or likely to rise to the base of the 
footing or above then the value of W' shall be taken as 0.5
	
c) 	
If the water table is likely to permanently got located at depth Df < D" < 
(Df +B) t then the value of W' be obtained by linear interpolation.
Since embankments have large base width and subsoil may consist of many layers having 
varying values of c and ø in such a case weighted average of c and ø values over a depth of 
1.5 H may be used.
Factor of Safety for Bearing Capacity of Embankments
Where subsoils are competent, minimum factor of safety of 1.5 shall be considered against 
bearing capacity failure.

Stability of Cohesionless Slopes
The stability of fill slopes built of cohesionless gravels, sands and silty sands, depends on; 
(a) the angle of internal friction of the fill material, ø’, (b) the slope angle, (c) the unit weight 
of the fill, and (d) the pore water pressures. The critical failure mechanism is usually surface 
raveling or shallow sliding which can be analyzed using simple infinite slope analysis.

 The values of ø’ for stability analyses may be determined by drained triaxial or direct shear 
tests. Porewater pressure due to seepage through the fill reduces the stability of the slopes. 
But static water pressure with the same water level inside and outside the slopes has no 
effect on stability. The factor of safety of slopes formed by cohesionless materials resting on 
firm foundation can be determined as indicated below:
 
F = Tan'
Tan   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
…Eqn. 3.9
Where 	
ø’ = angle of internal friction; and 
	
β= angle of slope with horizontal.
The maximum stable slope angle of sandy embankment is related to the peak friction angle 
ø’. However, ø’ is a function of void ratio, i.e. the density and the confining stress at which the 
sand exists. For dry loose sands, as in case of dumped sand or gravel, ø’ is essentially equal 
to angle of repose. But slope steeper than angle of repose can be built in stable condition 
when the angle of friction is improved by compaction in thin layers. It is important to note that 
the angle of stable slope of cohesionless materials is independent of the height which may be 
indefinite. Sand dunes represent examples of natural slopes of varying height but constant 
slope. Furthermore, weight of the material does not affect the stability of slope, so that the 
safe angle for a submerged sand slope is the same as that for a slope composed of dry sand, 
with the exception of the special case of damp sand which has a high angle of repose due 
to capillary attraction. However limitation is imposed on height by other considerations like 
base failure and erosion.
Special conditions exist with partially submerged sand slopes affected by tidal conditions or 
seepage conditions (sudden draw down condition) or seepage condition which may cause 
the stability of fine sand slope to be considerably less than for dry or submerged sand. Factor 
of safety in such conditions is given by:
	
F = -w Tan'

Tan 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn. 3.10
Since – w

 ratio is typically about half for sands, the maximum stable slope is about half of 
that for dry or submerged condition.
Slopes in fine sands, silty sands, and silts are susceptible to failure by erosion due to surface 
runoff. Benches, paved ditches, and turfing on slopes can be used to reduce runoff velocities 
and retard erosion.
3.5	
Slip Circle Analysis for Cohesive Soil Slopes 
The first sign of imminent failure of slope is usually an outward or upward bulging near the 
toe and development of cracks usually along length wise direction and near the crest of the 
slope. Though in actual practice the failure plane may be a complex surface, in most stability 
analysis cases a circular cylindrical rupture surface is assumed to simplify the computations.
The analysis consists of drawing trial circles and calculating the factor of safety separately 
for each circle. For any given centre, several circles are drawn, passing through the toe, 



======================================================================

34
through the weakest sub-strata, and through other soil layers depending on the conditions 
obtaining, and the lowest factor of safety recorded. Analysis may be either by considering the 
stability of slope en-mass or by dividing the slip mass into many vertical slices and to consider 
the equilibrium of each slice, Methods that consider the slope en-mass include Culmann's 
method and Taylor's friction circle method. There are several versions of the method of slices 
available; the best known are Swedish Circle and Bishop's method. Each of these methods 
involves certain approximations. For most highway embankment problems it is sufficient to 
use approximate methods even though these may not fully satisfy the requirements of static 
equilibrium. The different methods available are however reviewed broadly in this section. 
Analysis in each case can be either by total stress analysis or effective stress analysis. 
3.5.1	
Taylors’ Method 
If the embankment and foundation are homogeneous and the slope is simple, Taylor's charts 
can be used directly for design of embankment. Even in other cases these charts can be 
made use of with advantage at the planning stage, especially when a number of alternatives 
are to be evaluated. 
Taylor, after investigating a large number of trial circles in homogeneous soil by friction circle 
method, produced tables for locating critical circle and evolved design charts for determining 
safe slopes. Taylor's design curves are reproduced wide Figs. 3.2 & 3.3. Fig. 3.2 shows, for 
various values of ø up to 250, the safe slope corresponding to stability number Ns which is 
equal to c/γH. For a particular value of stability number and ø, safe angle of slope can be 
determined by reading the chart. Alternatively for a particular value of angle of slope and 
ø, stability factor can be read from the chart and factor of safety computed as F=cNs/ γH. 
Fig. 3.3 is applicable when, ø =0 and failure is over a shallow base. 
3.5.2	
Swedish Slip Circle Method
In this method (also referred to as the Fellenius method, the conventional method of slices or 
the USBR method) the soil mass is divided into a number of slices as shown in Fig. 3.4. The 
slices need not be of the same width. It is convenient to make the boundaries between slices 
to coincide with breaks in the surface or sudden transitions from one material to another, If 
the slope is stable, then each slice must be stable under its own weight and the forces on its 
boundaries. For each slice if the inter-slice forces are ignored .the reaction from below must 
be equal to and opposite in direction to its weight, as these are the only two forces. Resolving 
the reaction into normal force and shear force and taking into consideration the forces on a 
slice will be as shown in Fig. 3.4. Factor of safety is then obtained by summing over for all the 
slices. The expression for the factor of safety with reference to Fig. 3.4 is given by:

 …Eqn. 3.11
It is convenient in many cases to express the pore water pressure ‘u’ as function of the total 
weight of the column of soil above the point considered by using a ratio ‘ru’ which is defined 
by the relation:

... Eqn. 3.12 
Where h is the depth of the point in the soil mass below the soil surface, and γ is the bulk 
density of soil. The expression then becomes: 	  
	
F= 
 ∑[c'l+(Wcosα(1-rusec2α)tanø']                                             ... Eqn. 3.13 
The recommended method of recording the calculations is given in Table 3.4. A graphical 
approach to these calculations is also available (Murthy 1974). 
The Swedish method permits a quick and direct computation of the factor, of safety and is therefore 
advantageous where calculations are done by hand. A large number of slip circles is normally 
required to be analyzed in each case and this is facilitated in this method due to its simplicity. 
3.5.3	
Bishop’s Method
It has been shown that the conventional method of slices (i.e, the Swedish slip circle) could 
be in error where the central angle α, and the pore water pressure factor ru are large. The 
error increases with increasing values of α, and u. However, it is on the conservative side. 
This is the reason why engineers continue to prefer the conventional procedure. But in large 
scale work and high embankments, the conventional procedure results in overdesign and 
uneconomical sections. In such situations, Bishop's solution is preferable. This method also 
follows the method of slices but in addition recognizes the existence of side forces on each 
slice. There are two versions of the Bishop's method, one rigorous and the other simplified. 
Both-are reviewed below: 
a)	
Bishop’s Rigorous method 
The-rigorous method yields the following expression for factor of safety, Fig. 3.5.

... Eqn. 3.14
For discussion of conditions to be satisfied to determine the internal forces X and E, the 
reader is referred to the earlier work by Bishop (1955). The determination of the interslice 
forces is necessary for a rigorous solution of the equation given above. 
Sharma (1972) has suggested a simple graphical approach for circular arc analysis yielding 
values of factor of safety very close to those computed by most sophisticated methods 
requiring high speed digital computers. 
	
**a)	 The ru factor is linearly related to factor of safety F for range of ru values 
from 0.0 to 0.7 usually encountered in engineering practices (Bishop 1952. 
1955, Bishop and Morgenstern, 1960). The extra- ordinary advantage of this 
relationship is that it gives an immediate picture of the influence of pare 
pressure on the factor of safety. 
	
b) 	
Generally speaking, ru is not constant all along the slip surface, but in most 
stability problems an average value can readily be calculated and used with 
little loss of accuracy.

The use of the above equation represents 'Bishop's Routine Method’; the recommended 
method of recording the calculations is given in Table 3.5, Fig. 3.5. In practical application of 
this method, as F appears on both sides of the equation, F has to be assumed in advance 
and mα is to be calculated for this F. For this purpose, a chart is given in Fig. 3.5 which 
provides mα for known values of α and ø' and assumed F. The factor of safety is worked out 
as. Col. (14)/Col (7) of Table 3.5. This is compared with the assumed value of F. If they do not 
agree, a new value of F is assumed and the process repeated. The new trial requires only 
additional sub-columns under columns 13 and 14. Thus, after two or three trials, the correct 
factor of safety is evaluated for this assumed failure surface. To obtain the factor of safety for 
the slope, several failure surfaces have to be tried.

Chart Solutions for Analysis
A number of chart solutions for embankment stability problems have been developed to 
reduce the time involved in calculations. Main among these is the charts developed by Taylor, 
Bishop and Morgenstern (Geotechnique 10, 1960), Morgenstern, Spencer, Hunter, Hunter 
and Schuster and Huang. Of the chart solutions available, those of Taylor, Hunter and Hunter 
and Schuster are based on total stress analysis and are best suited for analyzing end-of-
construction stability. These are ideal for use as regards road embankment design. Other 
charts are based on effective stress analysis and can be applied in all cases. Morgenstern's 
solution is particularly good for small dams and consequently might be applicable where 
highway embankment is used as an earth dam or where flooding might occur behind a 
highway fill. All these methods make similar assumptions regarding geometry etc., but differ 
in assumptions about variation of cohesion with depth, position of water table, base condition, 
drawdown condition and slope of failure surface. Review of the chart solutions is available 
in Highway Research Record No. 345 and Transport Research Record 548 (published by 
the Transportation Research Board, U.S.A.) In general, simpler solutions using total stress 
analysis are adequate for highway embankment design.

3.5.5	
Miscellaneous Hints about Slip Circle Analysis
A few useful hints about design when conducting a slip circle analysis are brought out in the 
succeeding paragraphs for guidance. 
3.5.5.1	
Locating the centre of critical circle 
In slip circle analysis, a trial and error approach for locating the circle having the smallest 
factor of safety is necessary. For this purpose, the normal procedure is to establish a grid of 
centers and calculate the factor of safety for each. The factor of safety is then entered on the 
grid and contours of equal safety factor drawn. The parameters which influence the position 
of the critical circle in a given case are: the slope of the embankment, depth of hard strata, 
the soil properties ø, c/ γh, and the pore-pressure. Fellenius charts or Taylor's Tables may 
be used for locating the approximate critical circle. However, it should be noted that for base 
failures, provision of a balancing berm shifts the critical centre towards the berm. Also there 
are usually two critical centers’, one slightly above the embankment level and the other at a 
greater height. The latter is usually more critical. 
For slope failures, contours showing the variation in factor of safely are roughly elliptical, with 
the major axis approximately at right angles to the surface of the slope and several times the 
minor axis. The centre of critical slip circle is usually located close to and slightly above the 
perpendicular bisector of the slope.
3.5.5.2	
Tension cracks
One of the features of rotational slips in cohesive soils is the appearance of a vertical crack 
running parallel to the top of the slope and at some distance from it usually about 1.5 meter 
from the edge. The maximum depth of tension crack is given by the equation 
	
	
Z= tan (

 
∅
.

   
            	 	
	
	
	
 ... Eqn.3.20 
To account for the effect of tension cracks in stability analysis, the effective length of the slip 
circle for the purpose of resisting moment is taken only up to the end of the tension crack. 
For calculation, the position of tension crack is so assumed that its lowest point touches the 
circle under consideration. The most dangerous condition in the case of tension cracks would 
occur during rainy season when these fill up with water and exert a hydrostatic pressure 
horizontally of the magnitude of 
	
PH= 0.5 γ Z2 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
... Eqn. 3.21 
In making the stability computations, this pressure is added to the total driving force. 
3.6	
Stability Analysis for other Modes of Failure 
Planar and composite failure: Methods of analyzing stability for non-circular slip surfaces are 
numerous. For example see Kenney (1956), Janbu (1956), Nonveiller (1965), Morgenstern 
and Price (1965 and 1967). Of these, the method suggested by Janbu (1956) is recommended; 
since it permits easy hand calculations (refer Fig. 3.7). The expression for factor of safety, 
with reference

on factor of safety.

For more accurate treatment of stability on non-circular slip surfaces, the method developed 
by Morgenstern and Price (1967) can be used. However, it requires the use of a computer.

Sliding Block Method
The method is frequently applied in two circumstances: 
	
(a)	
When a thin layer of soft soil (which may not necessarily be horizontal) is 
encountered at shallow depth in the foundation. 
	
(b)	
When the embankment rests on a hard rock stratum which is unlikely to be 
involved in the failure. 
The analysis is possible in terms of both total stress and effective stress depending upon the 
conditions of the project and availability of data on hand. 
In this method, it is usual to divide the sliding mass into two or three large sections or 
wedges. The upper and the lower wedges are respectively called the active and the passive 
wedges. In a three wedge system, the middle wedge is generally referred to as the sliding 
block, Fig 3.8

Stability Analysis Using Software
Slip circle analysis is a method of checking the stability of any slope against its probability to 
fail in rotational mode; sometimes failure surface may not be circular. The factor of safety for a 
particular circle passing through the slope is calculated by taking into account force equilibrium 
and/or moment equilibrium. While some methods of analysis consider force equilibrium and 
moment equilibrium, some methods consider only force equilibrium (Abramson Lee. W. et. 
al.) “Slope stability and stabilization methods” (John Wiley”) the location (center and radius) 
of the most critical circle  depends on all the factors described above. The critical circle is the 
one with lowest FOS which has the highest probability to fail in case the disturbing force is 
greater than or equal to the resisting force. Hence, the objective of the analysis is to find the 
most critical circle by an iterative method.
There are many types of software available for use. The modes in which the input parameters 
are provided in these softwares differ from each other. Similarly the output format also differs 
from one program to another. The user should be familiar with both these aspects.

In software, by defining the phreatic line, the unit weight above and below the phreatic lines 
are automatically considered by the software. The same condition can be modeled by defining 
two separate densities for soils above and below the phreatic line. 
There are various ways and means by which the critical circle can be found and different 
software has different options and tools to find the circle which has the lowest FOS. The most 
common iterative method is to define a grid of centers and a defined point for the circle to 
pass. The user must check all possible circles by changing the location of grid and point of 
passing to find the critical circle.
The software automatically calculates the FOS for all possible circles passing through this 
point and varying the location of the centers within the defined boundary of the grid. There 
are few advanced softwares available which also automatically search the critical circle by 
increasing and decreasing the radius of the circle However, these features are provided just 
to help for a quick search. It is up to the user to ensure that all possibilities are checked by an 
iterative method before concluding for the most critical circle. 
The critical circle may or may not pass through the toe of embankment; it depends on the 
properties of the foundation soil parameters. The weaker the foundation soil, higher is the 
probability of deep seated failure 
The basic method to ensure that the critical circle has been derived is by drawing a contour 
map of all FOS The center of the critical circle shall lie within the defined grid of centers and 
not on the edge of the grid. It is strongly advised that at least in case of one circle preferably 
critical circle, the force evaluation and calculation of factor of safety may be carried out by 
hand calculations or have the data from the software imported into the format given in Tables 
3.4 to 3.7 as relevant to the method of analysis adopted.

Seismic Slope Stability
The basic terminology used in this section is as follows
	
amax/g= Peak Horizontal Ground Acceleration (PHGA)
	
KH= Horizontal seismic coefficient expressed as amax/g
	
Kh= Design horizontal seismic coefficient expressed as 0.5 amax/g 
	
(As per 1893 section 6.4.2)
	
Z= zone factor expressed as amax/g
The ground accelerations associated with seismic events can induce significant inertia forces 
that may lead to instability of natural and man-made slopes and embankments. 
  In a pseudo-static limit equilibrium analysis, the earthquake inertia forces are represented by 
static loads applied at the centre of gravity of each “slice” through the potential failure mass. 
Numerous limit equilibrium methods and procedures are currently available to evaluate

static slope stability. The search for the critical surface i.e. the surface with the lowest 
factor of safety or yield acceleration may have to be repeated because the critical surface 
from the static analysis is not necessarily the same as the critical surface for the dynamic 
analysis.
A wide variety of commercially available computer programs exist that can perform both 
static and pseudo-static limit equilibrium analyses.  Most of these programs provide general 
solutions to slope stability problems with provisions for using the simplified Bishop, simplified 
Janbu, Bishop’s Rigorous and Janbu’s generalized method and/or Spencer’s method of 
slices.
In principle, pseudo-static limit equilibrium analysis can be performed using either a total or 
an effective stress analysis.  Problems of estimating pore water pressures induced by cyclic 
shearing are avoided by using a total stress analysis. 
In the pseudo-static limit equilibrium analysis, a seismic coefficient is used to represent the 
effect of the inertia forces imposed by the earthquake upon the potential failure mass. The 
traditional pseudo-static limit equilibrium method of seismic stability analysis is illustrated in 
Fig. 3.9.  Simplifications made in using the pseudo-static approach to evaluate seismic slope 
stability include replacing the cyclic earthquake motion with a constant horizontal acceleration 
equal to kH x g, where kH is the seismic coefficient, and g is acceleration of gravity, and 
assuming that this steady acceleration induces an inertia force kHW through the center of 
gravity of the potential failure mass, where W is the weight of the potential failure mass.

Liquefaction
During an earthquake seismic waves travel vertically and rapid loading of soil occurs under 
undrained conditions since pore water has no time to move out. In saturated soils the seismic 
energy causes an increase in pore water pressure and subsequently the effective stress 
decrease. This results in loss of shear strength of soil and soil starts to behave as a fluid. This 
fluid is no longer able to sustain the load of structure and structure fails. This phenomenon is 
known as liquefaction. In other words the saturated soil which loses its strength and stiffness 
due to earthquake shaking is known as liquefiable soil.



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015

The phenomenon of liquefaction can also be explained by considering the shear strength of 
soils. Soils fail under externally applied shear forces. The shear strength of soil is governed 
by effective or inter-granular stresses. Effective stress is equal to deference between total 
stress and porewater pressure i.e. σ’ = σ – u
Shear strength τ of soil is given as:     τ = c’ + σ’ tan φ	 	
	
      ... Eqn.3.31
It can be seen that cohesionless soil (where c = 0), such as sand, will not possess any shear 
strength when the effective stresses approaches zero and it will transform into liquid state. 
During liquefaction, soil strength and its ability to support foundation get reduced. Soils in 
liquefied state exert higher pressure on retaining walls, which can cause them to tilt or slide. 
This movement can cause settlement of the retained soil and distress of structures on the 
ground surface. Increased pore water pressure can also trigger slope failures in the form of 
slides and flows.  
Unsaturated soils are not subject to liquefaction because vibratory forces from earthquakes 
do not cause any increase in pore water pressure in such soils.
Liquefaction generally takes place in loose fine grained sands (fines*<5%, 0.20 mm <D60 
<1.0 mm and Cu between 2 to 5) with N value less than 15. Seed (1971) concludes that in case 
of soil strata indicating corrected N>15, the liquefaction of soil will not possibly take place. 
Liquefaction potential needs to be assessed layer wise quantitatively by the procedure given 
below.
*In this context fines are defined as silt+clay content, particle size < 75µ as per IS 1498
3.10	
Assessment of the Liquefaction Potential of Subsoil
The assessment of liquefaction potential is carried out mostly based on “Simplified Procedure” 
methodology developed by professors H. B. Seed & I. M. Idriss. FHWA-SA-97-077 chapter-5 
adopts the same procedure.  This procedure has become a Standard of Practice (SOP) all 
over the world. For details refer Youd. T. L. and others (2001).This is an exhaustive report 
and discusses the development of the various parameters involved in the calculations of 
liquefaction and Factor of safety.
Estimation of following two variables is required for knowing the susceptibility of soil for 
liquefaction. If induced Cyclic Shear Stress (CSR) is more than mobilized shear resistance 
(CRR) liquefaction will occur. 
	
•	
Liquefaction potential or seismic resistance of the soil layers expressed in 
terms of CSR (Cyclic Stress Ratio) and
	
•	
Liquefaction capacity or the capacity of the soil to resist liquefaction expressed 
in terms of CRR (Cyclic Resistance Ratio).
	
•	
If the factor of safety as defined by CRR/CSR >1, the soil is considered as 
non liquefiable.
Following are the steps involved in the calculation:



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
52
Step 1: 	
Calculate Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR).
	
CSR = τav/σ’V0 = 0.65 (amax /g) (σV0/σ’V0 ) rd                   	
... Eqn.3.32
	
Ref.  Youd. T. L. and others (2001) 
	
Where,
	
amax = peak horizontal acceleration at ground surface generated by earthquake;
	
g = acceleration due to gravity;
	
σV0 & σ’V0 = total and effective vertical overburden stress respectively;
	
rd = stress reduction coefficient (accounts for flexibility of soil)
 	
rd = 1.0 – 0.00765z for z < 9.15 m 
 	
rd = 1.174 – 0.0267z for 9.15 m < z < 23 m
	
rd = 0.744 – 0.008z for 23 m < z < 30 m
	
rd = 0.50 for z > 30 m
	
z is the depth below ground surface
Step 2:	
Calculate Cyclic Resistance Ratio (CRR).
The liquefaction resistance of soil (CRR) can be determined based on Field test results. 
Laboratory tests are difficult since in-situ state of stress generally cannot be re-established 
in the laboratory easily (except in case specialized sampling techniques such as ground 
freezing). Tests which are commonly used for assessment of liquefaction resistance of soil 
are: Standard Penetration Test (SPT); Cone Penetration Test (CPT); Shear Wave Velocity 
(SWVs); & Becker Penetration Test (BPT). Procedure for calculating CRR based on SPT is 
only discussed here, as it is the most common practice in vogue now a days:
Step 2A: 	Calculation of (N1)60 SPT blow count normalized to an overburden Pressure of 
approximately 100 kPa 
	
(N1)60 = NmCNCECBCRCS	
	
	
	
	
	
... Eqn.3.33	
Where, Nm is measured penetration resistance (five different corrections are applied for Nm 
and are listed below);
	
a)	
CN is factor to normalize Nm to reference effective overburden pressure σ’V0 
of approximately 100 kPa, CN = (Pa/σ’V0)0.5  & CN ≤ 1.7;
	
b)	
CE is correction factor for hammer energy: CE = (ER/60)
	
c)	
CB correction factor for borehole diameter (1 for 65-115 mm, 1.05 for 150 mm 
& 1.15 for 200 mm dia.)
	
d)	
CR correction factor for rod length =0.75 for 3.0 m to 4.0 m
		
    =0.85 for 4.0 m to 6.0 m
		
    =0.95 for 6.0 m to 10.0 m
		
    =1.0 for 10.0m to 30.0 m

e)	
CS is correction for sampler with or without liners (= 1 for sampler with liner & 
1.1 to 1.3 for sampler without liner)
Step 2B: 	Calculation of (N1)60cs - SPT blow count normalized to an equivalent clean sand 
value.
	
(N1)60cs = α + β (N1)60		
	
	
	
      	
	
... Eqn.3.34
	
Where,
	
α = 0 & β = 1.0 for Fine Content (FC) ≤ 5%
	
α = exp [1.76 – (190/FC2)] & β = [0.99 + FC1.5/1000] for 5% ≤ FC < 35%
	
α = 5.0 & β = 1.2 for FC ≥ 35%
Step 2C:	 Calculation of cyclic resistance ratio CRR7.5 (for earthquake magnitude 7.5)
	
CRR7.5 = 1/(34-(N1)60+((N1)60/135)+50/(10(N1)60+ 45)2-(1/200)	
... Eqn.3.35
	
Ref. Youd. T. L. and others (2001) 
The above equation is valid for (N1)60 < 30. For (N1)60 ≥ 30, clean sand granular soils are 
too dense to liquefy and are classed as non-liquefiable.
Step 2D:	 Deciding the magnitude scaling factor (MSF)
The CRR evaluated in STEP 2C apply only to magnitude 7.5 earthquakes. For magnitudes 
of earthquake other than M = 7.5 EQ. “Magnitude Scaling Factor” have been introduced. The 
value MSF given by Idriss in 1995 for N= 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5 are 2.2, 1.76, 1.44, 1.19, 
1.00, 0.84 & 0.72 respectively. These MSF values are listed in Table 3.3 of Youd. T. L. and 
others (2001) which are reproduced in the table 3.9 below. 
Step 2E:	 Evaluation of CRR
	
CRR = MSF x CRR7.5	 	
	
	
	
	
	
      ... Eqn.3.36
FOS against liquefaction = CRR/CSR. If FOS > 1; soil is non liquefiable.

Distress Caused by Liquefaction and its Mitigation
In case of embankments, the ground beyond the toe may lose shear strength and suffer 
lateral flow. This may cause part of the embankment to settle. In case of large settlements,

cracks may appear on the top crest of the embankment. To a certain extent these damage 
may be controlled by
	
i)	
Providing berms at the toe of the embankment or increasing the berm width 
wherever feasible.
	
ii)	
The subsoil may be densified by various methods of compaction including 
dynamic compaction, so that N value is higher than the liquefiable limits
	
iii)	
Adopting ground improvement methods such as stone columns or compacted 
granular columns basal reinforcement, pile supported basal reinforcement in 
the ground.
In general these methods may be costly and may only be adopted after detailed study. 
Experience concerning liquefaction and its control in case of embankments is scant. Since 
liquefaction of embankments is site-specific problem, generalized solution may not be 
feasible. Embankments are structures of low risk, and hence in certain cases, it may be 
economical to allow some distress/failures due to liquefaction and earthquakes and same 
can be repaired subsequently. 
In case of structures, deep foundations resting on layers not susceptible to liquefaction 
are adopted to ensure their stability. This solution may not be economical for highway 
embankments.
Factor of safety value of 1.0 can be adopted when liquefaction analysis is carried out for 
design of embankments.

Chapter 4
SETTLEMENT ANALYSIS
4.1 	
General
4.1.1	
Highway embankments constructed over soft and compressible soils undergo 
settlements. Such settlements cause unevenness of riding surface and eventually cracking of 
pavements. This leads to increase in maintenance cost of pavements. High quality asphaltic 
pavements currently in use are susceptible to failures even due to small settlements. Sudden 
depression at bridge approach also forms a major maintenance problem. It is therefore 
essential to pay attention to this aspect on high embankments so that the post construction 
settlement is contained within reasonable limits. 
4.1.2	
Settlement refers to the decrease in void ratio of the fill material constituting the 
body of the embankment and/or the subsoil constituting the foundation of the embankment. 
The process of reduction in the voids, accompanied by the expulsion of water under load, is 
familiarly known as “the process of consolidation”. The settlements are calculated based on 
Terzaghi’s theory of consolidation.
4.2	
Consolidation of Sub-Soil
4.2.1. Most of the settlements of highway embankment are due to deformation of sub-
soil under the embankment loads. This consolidation is traditionally considered to have 
three components: initial settlement; consolidation settlement; and secondary settlement. 
Immediately upon loading, a saturated cohesive soil deforms without movement of pore 
water; this is called initial settlement or settlement due to shear at constant volume since the 
volumetric compressibility of saturated clay is essentially zero. Subsequently, time dependent 
settlement occurs as pore water flows out of the soil and load is transferred to the soil skeleton. 
The part of the time dependant settlement, where rate is controlled by the rate of dissipation 
of the excess pore water pressure, is called consolidation settlement and it continues until 
the pore water pressure generated by the loading is in equilibrium with hydraulic boundary 
conditions. Finally, a time dependent settlement occurs that is not controlled by the rate 
of dissipation of excess pore water pressure. This component is referred to as secondary 
settlement or compression. The principal settlement relevant for highway embankments is 
consolidation settlement.
4.2.2	
Initial settlement does not have much of a practical significance in case of highway 
embankments. However, if a designer is interested, this settlement can be calculated by use 
of charts prepared besides others by Giroud (1968).
4.2.3	
Consolidation Settlement: Where undisturbed samples are obtainable, settlements 
can be predicted by conducting laboratory consolidation tests applying the appropriate loads. 
In the interpretation of laboratory consolidation tests it is common practice to include the 
immediate and secondary compressions of all previous increments in the calculations of 
the consolidated void ratio under the subsequent increment. This practice compensates (in

IRC:75-2015
60
a general way) for the immediate settlements that occur in the field although the time rate 
relationships are different.
4.2.4	
For the many cases that arise in practice in which secondary compressions 
and creep at constant volume are not of great importance in which the compressible stratum 
is either deeply buried between layers of stiffer soil, or in thin layers compared to the size 
of the loaded area, the ultimate settlements can be calculated by one-dimensional  theory. 
The error on this account in the prediction of consolidation settlements will seldom 
exceed ± 25 percent in the case of normally consolidated deposits. For over consolidated 
deposits, the percentage error may be much higher but the total settlements will always be 
much less.
4.2.5 	
in as much as volume changes are considered to be one dimensional, the apparent 
consolidation settlement Si of each segment of clay stratum can be computed using the 
equation.

eO= initial void ratio
The magnitude of total settlement of foundation strata is determined by summation of 
consolidation in the various strata forming the foundation. To allow for the variation of pressure 
with different depths, the substrata is generally divided into thin layers and settlements 
calculated for each layer separately before totaling. The first task is therefore to identify the 
number and the thickness of the layers to be considered. This can be done with the help of 
a borehole log. 
4.2.6	
Prediction of Consolidation Settlements
The purpose of performing consolidation tests is to determine the stress strain properties of 
the soil and thus they allow predicting consolidation settlements in the field. The computations 
are performed by projecting the laboratory test results (as contained in the parameters Cc, Cr 
,eo, σc’) back to the field conditions .For simplicity, the discussions of consolidation settlement 
predictions in this chapter consider only the case of one dimensional consolidation and only 
the ultimate consolidation settlement will be computed. One dimension consolidation means

IRC:75-2015
61
only vertical strains occur in the soil. In this context, a compressible stratum refers to the 
strata that have a Cc or Cr large enough to contribute significantly to the settlement. The most 
common one dimensional consolidation problems are those that evaluate settlement due to 
the placement of a long and wide fill and due to the wide spread lowering of the ground water 
table.
The ultimate consolidation settlement is the value after all of the excess pore water pressures 
have dissipated, which may require many years or even decades. The ultimate consolidation 
settlement for normally consolidated and over-consolidated soil can be determined by the 
following formulas.
Case I normally consolidated soil
If σz0’= σc’ the soil by definition is normally consolidated. The initial and final conditions are 
shown in Fig. 4.8 and the compressibility is defined by Cc, the slope of the virgin curve. 
For normally consolidated soil the ultimate consolidation is calculated as per the following 
equation
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
…Eqn 4.3
	
Where H= thickness of the soil layer
When using the above equation, compute σz0’ and σzf’ at the midpoint of each layer.
Case IIA Over-consolidated Soils (σz0’< σzf’≤ σ’c)
If neither σz0’ nor σzf’ exceed σ’c, the entire consolidation process occurs on the recompression 
curve as shown in Fig 4.1. The analysis is thus identical to that for normally consolidated 
soils except we use the recompression index, Cr, instead of the compression index, Cc.

Case IIB Over-consolidated Soils (σz0’< σ’c < σzf’)
If the consolidation process begins on the recompression curve and ends on the virgin curve, 
as shown in Fig 4.1, then the analysis must consider both Cc and Cr:

This condition is quite common, because many soils that might appear to be normally 
consolidated from a geologic analysis actually have a small amount of over consolidation 
(Mesri et al., 1994).
When using equation, σz0’, σ’c, σzf’ must be computed at the midpoint of each layer.

4.2.8	
For clays which are normally loaded and which are of ordinary sensitivity, 
experience has shown that the Compression Index Cc is related to liquid limit of the soil by 
statistical relationship Cc=0.009( L.L-10). It may therefore, be prudent to take advantage of 
this relationship to evaluate Cc in case of normally loaded clays without resorting to extensive 
consolidation tests. However, consolidation tests would be necessary where the embankment 
is built on deep deposit on soft clay and where both magnitude and rate of settlement have 
to be determined to formulate the method of foundation treatment and or the method of 
construction. Consolidation tests would also be necessary in the case of clays which are 
known to be over consolidated or preloaded and sometimes even to determine whether clay 
is normally loaded or preloaded. For over consolidated clays, the Cc value obtained from 
laboratory consolidation tests is apt to be higher than for normally consolidated clay. The 
prediction of settlements using the Cc value ignoring the fact that the clay had been pre- 
consolidated clay and treating it as though it had been normally consolidated would result in 
an error on the conservative side and the error may happen to be appreciable if the degree 
of over-consolidation is particularly high.
4.2.9	
Rate of consolidation settlement: The time‘t’ required to reach a certain percentage 
of consolidation in a stratum is given by the equation. 
	

  
		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
...Eqn   4.10
	
Where T= Time factor corresponding to the degree of consolidation
	
cv = Coefficient of consolidation for range of stress applicable
	
H = the length of effective drainage path. For one-way drainage H=D and for two 
way drainage H=D/2
	
D = Depth of compressible strata
4.2.10	
The value of time factor T for various degrees of consolidation and different drainage 
conditions is taken either from tables 4.1 and 4.2 or Fig 4.2 which gives the relationship 
between the dimensionless time factor T and average percentage of consolidation ‘U’ for 
various typical boundary conditions. The choice of curve in Fig. 4.2 or column in Tables 4.1 
and 4.2 depends on the type of drainage conditions and porewater pressure distribution 
diagram. For typical embankment for clay layer in the subsoil is situated below a sand blanket 
on the top and gravely strata below, the drainage is two-way and curve 1 in Fig. 4.2 or column 
4 of table 4.1 should be used to evaluate T. In case there is no gravelly layer underlying the 
clay stratum, drainage will occur in only one direction towards the sand blanket and curve 2 in 
Fig 4.2 or column 3 of Table 4.2 would be appropriate.
4.3 	
Consolidation Settlements Vis-a-Vis Loading
4.3.1	
The loading period is generally proceeded by excavation and then the load is 
applied at a varying rate. Frequently, the loading is approximated by a uniform rate and the 
settlement at the end of the loading period is assumed to be the same as that which would 
have resulted in half the loading period had all the load been applied at once. In principle, 



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
64
the rate of primary consolidation can be calculated for any variation of loading to any degree 
of precision desired by splitting up the increase in load into small increments, calculating the 
rate of settlement for each increment independently, and adding the resulting values. This 
approach is too cumbersome for practical purposes.
4.3.2 	
The settlement analysis can give reasonably close forecast of the amount and 
rate of settlement provided care and judgment are exercised in the selection of samples and 
interpretation of test results. Bore-hole records covering the whole site should be carefully 
studied. If the soil strata over the site are similar, a representative soil profile can be drawn 
for the site and the average values of Cc marked there on for each stratum. The choice 
of a representative soil profile involves careful judgment. In the case of thick clay strata, 
compressibility must not be assumed as constant throughout. Normally loaded clays usually 
show progressively decreasing compressibility with increasing depth.

Time Factor T

4.3.3 	
Rate of settlement will be maximum when the embankment is saturated and the 
subsoil is buoyant. These parameters are liable to change with season. The embankment 
load will increase during rainy season when density may be close to saturated density and 
will reduce dry seasons. Thus settlement will be occurring at different rates during different 
seasons and the calculations of total time required for settlement will have to be modified to 
account for these variations.
In order to calculate the settlement, it is necessary to find out stress distribution with soil due 
to the embankment loading.
4.4 	
Settlement Analysis: Determination of Stresses within the Foundation
4.4.1 	
In equation 4.1 the value of ΔP depends on the contact pressure and the least 
dimension of the loaded area. Because of the considerable base width of most embankments, 



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015
65
the stress beneath the centre of embankment usually decreases slowly with depth. The 
general approach for determining the stresses below the embankment is to integrate the 
Boussinesq solution for stresses due to single vertical load on a semi infinite homogenous 
isotropic mass. For common embankment problems, influence charts developed by 
Osterberg (1957) are useful and provide ready solution. These are reproduced here for ease 
of reference. The stress given by the chart is the vertical stress directly under the vertical 
face of an embankment of infinite extent. Vertical stresses for any point in the foundation 
can be found by super-imposition. For stresses under a corner, such as the vertical face of 
an embankment ending abruptly against the wall, stresses are one half of those given in the 
chart.
4.4.2	
Several other solutions for determining the vertical stresses under an embankment 
are also available. For instance Middlebrooks (1936) Newmark (1941, 1942), Perloff et al 
(1967), W. Steinbrenner (1934) and R.E. Fadum etc have developed solutions for such 
cases.
4.4.3	
The design load used to evaluate the settlement and stability is the weight of 
overlying embankment and pavement materials. Except for the upper one meter or so, 
embankments are not seriously affected by traffic loads and as such traffic loads are 
generally neglected. When designing approaches, if the abutment for floating span rests on 
the embankment, load due to this however has to be considered. Another requirement in the 
case of floating abutment is to determine the bearing capacity near the slope according to 
procedure recommended by Meyerhof (1957)

Extracts from Influence values for vertical stresses in a semi-infinite mass due to embankment 
loading. (Page 393) by Br. J.O Osterberg (Illinois, U.S.A)
Illustrations to use Osterberg’s chart for calculation of stresses. 
1)	
Find the vertical stress beneath an embankment at the location shown in figure ‘a’
	
For the left side, 
= 0.5,	
	
	
	
And from chart I = 0.397,
	
Similarly for Right Side, I = 0.478
	
And the total I = 0.397+0.478 =0.875
	
The vertical stress is then σz = 0.875q.
2)	
Find the vertical stress beneath an embankment at the location shown in figure ‘b’
	
For dashed and solid portion,
	
 
= 4, and I = 0.499,	
	
	
	
	
Subtract the influence value for dashed portion,
	
 
= 1, and I = 0.455,
	
The stress then is σz = 0.044q
3)	
Find the vertical stress beneath the embankment at the location shown in figure ‘c’
	
Stress due to abc, is the same as due to cde, since one is plus and the other is 
minus, the stress is same as the embankment was vertical at b
 	
 
= 2.5, and from chart I = 0.492 
	
The stress then is σz = 0.4q
Notes:
1)	
The stress given by the chart is the vertical stress directly under the vertical face 
of an embankment of infinite extent
2)	
For stress under a corner such as under the vertical face of embankment ending 
abruptly against a wall, the stresses are 0.5 of those given in the chart.

4.5	
Tolerable Settlements
Settlements of embankments have the following components:
	
I.	
Settlement due to self-weight of fill.
	
II.	
Settlement of the subsoil.
Settlement of embankments and more importantly, rate of settlement consideration are 
of relevance due to the effect such settlements will have on the pavement performance, 
especially in terms of developing uneven and rough riding surface.   
4.5.1 	
Settlement due to Self-Weight of Fill
Settlement within the fill due to self-weight depends on the type of fill material, degree of 
compaction and fills height. Materials which shall not be used for embankment fill are listed in 
Clause.305.2.1.1  of the MORTH “Specifications for Road and Bridge works. When acceptable 
fill materials, are used and the fill is well compacted to the minimum requirements specified 
in Cl.305.2.1.5 of the publication referred to above, settlements of the embankments due to 
self-weight are generally not of serious concern.
Settlements progress as the embankment is built and post construction or residual settlements 
are not likely to occur.
If the fill material is not well compacted during the course of construction, it has been the 
common experience that such fills will continue to settle for a long time and there is no easy 
and economical solution to control such settlements of the fill, in the post construction phase. 
Hence the compaction of the fill ab-initio is very important and shall be adhered to in practice 
and all quality control steps shall be taken as per Clause. 903.2, of MORTH “Specifications 
for Road and Bridge Works”.
Reference may also be made to Table 7, I.S.- 1498- “Classification and Identification of soil 
for general Engineering Purposes” where in Col.4 the compressibility of different soil types 
when compacted and saturated is given. The Table is useful to understand the behavior of fill 
material proposed to be used, as well as in the selection of fill materials.   
4.5.2 	
Settlement of Subsoil
Subsoil layers also experience settlement due to embankment loads the magnitude and time 
rate at which these settlements progress depends on the nature of the subsoil.
	
i)	
Where subsoil layers are essentially low plastic or non-plastic soils, with 
adequate bearing capacity, settlements in the subsoil progress as the 
embankment is built up. Thus there would be none or very small residual 
settlements at the end of construction. Hence, such settlements are not of 
concern.



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015
71
	
ii)	
Where the subsoil consists of soft compressible clay layers in saturated 
condition, large settlements world occur. These settlements follow the 
“Terzaghi’s theory of consolidation” and require long time period for 
completion. It is essential that such subsoil conditions are identified at or 
prior to design stage and suitable ground improvement technique is adopted 
if required (Suitable ground improvement techniques have been discussed 
in chapter 5). Such techniques accelerate the settlement rate based on the 
design adopted. However even at the end of the design waiting period after 
ground improvement method adopted, some settlements may continue to 
occur. These may be termed “residual settlements”.        
The allowable limit for such residual settlements may be considered as 300mm. In general, 
these settlements progress at very slow rate. Hence it would be economical to allow such 
settlements to run their course than aim a design which has “negligible” residual settlements. 
This observation is particularly relevant where PVDs or stone columns are adopted for ground 
improvement.  
The designer may indicate the amount of residual settlement expected and time period for 
the same while designing embankments over soft subsoil deposits. 
In case of embankments on soft clays, where residual settlements as mentioned above are 
difficult to avoid, rigid pavements may not be suitable. Appropriate type of flexible pavement 
may be provided avoiding costly BC layer, till the rate of progress of residual settlement 
reduces to less than 25-30 mm/year.

GROUND IMPROVEMENT
5.1	
Introduction
Ground improvement technologies are geotechnical construction methods used to alter or 
improve poor ground conditions in order that construction of embankment can meet project 
performance requirements in terms of (a) Improved stability of slopes, (b) reduced settlements, 
and (c) Improved bearing capacity of the subsoil. Where the soil is susceptible to liquefaction, 
its resistance to liquefaction can also be improved by some of the ground improvement 
methods listed below. Ground improvement is called for where construction on untreated 
ground may lead to either excessive settlement or failure in rotational mode/bearing capacity. 
Ground improvement has one or more of the following main functions:
	
•	
To increase bearing capacity, shear or frictional strength,
	
•	
To increase density,
	
•	
To control deformations,
	
•	
To accelerate consolidation,
	
•	
To decrease imposed loads,
	
•	
To provide lateral stability,
	
•	
To form seepage cut-offs or fill voids,
	
•	
To increase resistance to liquefaction and,
	
•	
To transfer embankment loads to more competent layers.
5.2	
Ground Improvement Techniques
Adopting suitable ground improvement technique depends on the type of soil, construction 
feasibility, cost benefits and performance requirements in relation to slope stability, bearing 
capacity, settlement and liquefaction.
State of art reports IRC-HRB: SR-13, SR-14 and IRC:113 deal with ground improvement in 
the context of embankment design and construction in an extensive manner. Contents of 
these publications are briefly mentioned below,
	
•	
SR-13- describes the fundamental concepts, properties of soft clays, building 
of embankments using stage construction.
	
•	
SR-14- deals with various ground improvement methods including vertical 
drains (PVDs), lime columns, stone columns, geosynthetics and dynamic 
consolidation.

embankments on soft soils and concerns mainly with geosynthetic basal 
reinforcement.
Reference shall be made to the publications listed above for design and construction purposes.
In this chapter the above techniques are mentioned briefly. Further, ground improvement 
techniques not mentioned in the above publications are also presented briefly.

•

Choice of a particular ground improvement method depends on
	
i)	
Nature and extent of the problem in terms of initial strength, depth of soft 
clay, and height of embankment to be built.
	
ii)	
Time available for ground improvement and the cost involved also play an 
important role.
Most of the ground improvement methods suggested above involve detailed construction 
and design methodologies. Hence a careful technical study shall be made for the selection 
of suitable ground improvement method. 
5.2.1 	
Partial or Total Removal of Undesirable Material
When unsatisfactory material not confirming to MORTH section 300   is encountered at or 
near the surface, it may be economical and prudent to remove part or all of it and replace 
it with acceptable materials than to deal with problem of countering subsidence over years.

This treatment is often used in swampy areas of peat and muck deposits. Generally on high 
embankment projects, removal of 1.5 – 3m of unsuitable material from original ground level 
may  be possible over the full width of the fill. However, on the whole, this will be governed 
by the costs involved relative to other methods. Excavation of soft foundation soils and their 
replacement are often considered relatively simple operations. Practically, however, this 
is not the case and stringent inspection and control may usually be necessary to assure 
satisfactory and economical results. At times, more sophisticated techniques like controlled 
blasting may have to be adopted to achieve displacement of the soft material, followed by 
controlled placement of the foundation and embankment fill. 
5.2.2	
Use of Light Weight Fill Materials as Embankment Fills with or Without Replacement 
of Poor Base Soil 
Settlement and stability problems can be decreased if the weight of the embankment is 
reduced. Light weight materials such as flyash, expanded shale, cinder, slag, saw dust etc; 
have been used with good degree of success in several cases for embankment construction 
to lessen the load on the foundation materials. However, availability of these materials and 
the relative costs are factors that may affect their use. IRC:SP-58 provide guidelines for use 
of flyash in road embankments 
5.2.3	
Stage Wise Construction of Embankment with or Without Replacement of Poor 
Base Soil-

Soft Ground Part A – Stage Construction”. 
5.2.4	
Soil Stabilization using Lime, Cement or other Chemicals
5.2.4.1	
Lime and lime- pozzolana stabilization
Lime is an excellent choice for short-term modification of soil properties, especially where 
the subsoil is of expansive nature, for example black cotton soil. Lime can modify almost all 
fine-grained soils, but the most dramatic improvement occurs in clayey soils of moderate to 
high plasticity. Modification occurs because calcium cations supplied by the hydrated lime 
replace the cations normally present on the surface of the clay mineral, promoted by the 
high pH environment of the lime-water system. Thus, the clay surface mineralogy is altered, 
producing benefits of
	
•	
Plasticity reduction
	
•	
Reduction in moisture-holding capacity (drying)
	
•	
Swell reduction
	
•	
Improved stability
	
•	
The ability to construct a solid working platform

Stabilisation by lime slurry injection as well as by adopting lime column technique is discussed 
in SR-14, IRC-HRB. For details regarding chemical reactions involved (Pozzolanic reactions) 
IRC SP 89 can be referred.
5.2.4.2	
Cement stabilization
Where subsoil is of expansive nature then mitigation measure for the unsuitable stratum 
normally involves removal of poor strata and replacement with suitable soil. However, 
when depth and extent of poor soil is large, it is not feasible for this technique and cement 
stabilization could be another possible mitigation technique. Details of cement stabilization 
are covered in IRC:SP 89 “Guidelines for Soil and Granular Material Using Cement, Lime 
and Fly Ash and are not repeated here.
5.2.5	
Preloading
This section refers to use of preload without resorting to any process to accelerate the 
consolidation of soft subsoil. Reference can be made to SR-13 IRC HRB Chapter-5. The 
term “preloading” implies that a greater height of fill that is placed initially than required for 
the final level of the embankment. Alternatively the same can be accomplished by stage 
construction of embankment.
Preloading is a simple and an economical method for accelerating consolidation as compared 
with other methods of improving ground support. However, adequate instrumentations for 
monitoring the settlements and the development and dissipation of pore water pressures are 
essential for the success of this technique. Preloading is especially attractive when fill material 
is subsequently used on the same project for site preparation. By measuring the ground 
settlements and porewater pressure, it is possible to assess quantitatively the extent of ground 
improvement in terms of increase in the shear strength and predict its future behavior. The 
duration of preloading from the beginning of embankment placement to the end of removal of 
load depends on the ground response. The pre-loading techniques is likely to be inefficient 
when used alone because of very long periods of time required for obtaining significant 
consolidation settlements and subsequent appreciable strength gain of the soft clay to support 
the embankment loads. The preload time can be drastically reduced by the installation of 
vertical drains as they shorten the drainage path under which the clay will consolidate. 
5.2.6	
Ground Improvement Based on Consolidation of Subsoil
5.2.6.1	
Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVDs)
Prefabricated vertical drains are used in construction of embankments on soft clays to 
accelerate consolidation process. The construction of a new embankment or structure on 
soft ground causes the following
	
a)	
Increase in the pore water pressure in the subsoil , these pore water pressures 
are termed as excess hydrostatic pressures



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
76
	
b)	
With lapse of time pore water pressure decreases which in turn results in an 
increase in the effective stress in the soil. This increase in effective stresses 
lead to the increase in shear strength of the subsoil.
	
c)	
At the same time the entire process is accompanied by decrease in the 
volume of the soil leading to settlements.
PVDs are band shaped (rectangular cross-section) products consisting of a geotextile filter 
layer surrounding a plastic core. PVDs are also referred to as band drains. The width of 
band drains is normally 100 mm. For detailed specifications of PVDs MORTH Specifications 
for Roads and Bridge works clause 704.2.2 can be referred. Porewater flows through the 
permeable outer geotextile filter layer and is transmitted along the annular space between 
the core and the geotextile. Installation of prefabricated vertical drains accelerates the rate 
of dissipation of pore water pressure and leads to a corresponding increase in effective 
granular stress in the subsoil. This in turn leads to increase in shear strength of subsoil. 
Similarly time rate of settlement is accelerated. Detailed design of ground improvement using 
PVDs is discussed in IRC-HRB: SR-14 and various factors involved such as relationship 
between increase in shear strength and inter-granular stress, time vs. consolidation are 
presented.  The embankment is constructed in stages, with successive stages being built 
taking advantage of strength gained from the previous stage of loading. PVDs are installed 
in equilateral triangular pattern and the effective spacing between the band drains shall 
preferably be not more than 1200 mm. Reference shall also be made to IS 15284-Part-2: 
Design and Construction guidelines for pre-consolidation using vertical drains. Soft clays 
are prevalent in the coastal areas. Highway embankments constructed in these areas 
have used PVDS to enable rapid completion of the highway projects. Reference may be 
made to papers published viz., Mandal. A. K. et al. (IGC-2006, Guntur), Rao P.J. et al. 
(IGC-2011, Kochi), wherein two case histories dealing with use of PVDs including design, 
construction and monitoring are discussed. A typical cross-section of a PVD installation for 
embankments is shown in Fig. 5.1 (Typical example for design of PVD is included in the 
Annexure 5.1)

5.2.7	
Stone Columns
Use of stone columns is a highly effective technique to improve the strength and compressibility 
characteristics of soft clays. Stone columns are formed by making a borehole and backfilling 
with compacted stone. In the earlier phase of utilisation of this technique stone backfill was 
placed in layers and compacted by dropping a rammer. Stone columns so formed are termed 
as “rammed columns”. Rao P. J. et al. (1991) presents the case history of ground improvement 
using “Rammed column technique” in 12 m deep clay at Visakhapatnam on the east coast 
of India.
Rammed column technique is a slow process and hence it is normally used where length 
of the stretch to be improved is not long. In large projects or where deep layer of soft clay is 
present stone columns formed by vibratory methods are adopted. Vibratory stone columns 
are formed by vibro-replacement (wet, top feed) and vibro-displacement (dry, top or bottom 
feed). 
Embankments on soft ground have also been built using, reinforced stone columns and 
grouted stone columns. Experimental work on reinforced stone columns is reported in IRC: 
HRB- SR-14, Rao. P. Jagannatha and Kumar, Satish (IGC 1989) and the reinforced stone 
columns were found to develop much higher bearing capacity than unreinforced ground. 
Recently Niroumand and others (2011), Tandel and others (2012) Heitz and others (2005) 
have published papers regarding reinforced stone columns. Encased stone columns shall be 
used when the soil around need to be separated from the stones. A geosynthetic filter shall 
be selected as per the gradation and properties of stones of stone column and soil around. 
Typical example for design of stone columns (rammed/vibratory) is included in Annexure 5.1. 
If necessary, rotational stability of the embankment may be checked after determining the 
in-situ shear strength of the subsoil by suitable method.

5.2.7.1	
Vibro-replacement- wet method:
It refers to the wet, top feed process in which jetting water is used to aid the penetration of 
the ground by the vibrator. Due to the jetting action, part of the in-situ soil is washed to the 
surface. The oscillating vibrator sinks under its own weight. When the designed depth is 
reached, the borehole is cleaned of any loose muck and aggregates are poured down the 
borehole. The vibrator is slowly withdrawn in steps of 0.7 to 1.0 m and stone falls to the tip 
of vibrator. The vibrator is then lowered back into the borehole between 0.70 to 0.80 m with 
constant water jet at the tip of vibrator thereby creating a 0.2 to 0.3 m length of stone column. 
The action of vibrator presses the stone radially into the surrounding soil and compacts the 
stone in the vertical direction as well. This procedure is repeated till the desired length of 
stone column is formed.
5.2.7.2	
Vibro displacement: Refers to the dry, top or bottom feed process; almost no in-
situ soil appears at the surface, but is displaced by the backfill material. However, the wet 
replacement method is more commonly used.
Formation of stone columns by above method is monitored by measuring consumption of 
power by the vibrator during the penetration for drilling hole and also during the compaction 
of backfill stone. The quantity of stone consumed per meter of the column is also continuously 
monitored. Reference may be made to Rao. P. J., Biswas. P. et. al. (2011).
5.2.8	
Densification
Densification process is applicable for non-cohesive soils. There are numerous natural and 
man-made deposits where densification, can be adopted including granular hydraulic fills, 
coastal plain sediments, alluvial soils, and miscellaneous granular fills and/or deposits. 
Densification causes (a) increase in shear strength (b) reduction in settlements thereby 
enabling the construction of shallow foundations. Also, liquefaction potential can be 
reduced by densification of loose granular soil to a density beyond the threshold density 
triggering liquefaction. In earth retaining problems, the process can be performed prior to 
wall construction to decrease active earth pressure and increase passive resistance as the 
density is improved.
Some of the densification methods adopted are: 
	
i) 	
Dynamic compaction 
	
ii) 	
Vibro-compaction, 
	
iii) 	
Compaction grouting.
5.2.8.1	
Dynamic Compaction
Dynamic compaction is a method of ground improvement that results from the application of 
high levels of energy at the ground surface. The energy is applied by repeatedly raising and 
dropping a tamper with a mass ranging from 15 to 35 tonnes at heights ranging from 9 to 
30 m. The tamper is lifted and dropped by a conventional crane with a single cable plus a 
winch that has a free spool attachment that allows the single cable to unwind with minimum

friction. The tamper’s energy of impact at the ground surface results in densification of the 
deposit to depths that are proportional to the energy applied. The depth of improvement 
generally ranges from about 10 to15 m for light to heavy energy applications, respectively. 
If ground improvement is needed to provide a suitable bearing stratum for an embankment or 
structure, dynamic compaction may be a viable solution. Schematic arrangement of dynamic 
compaction is illustrated in Fig. 5.3.
Fig. 5.3 Systematic Arrangement of Dynamic Compaction
Dynamic compaction can be used at sites with a very heterogeneous mixture of deposits and 
at sites with gradation ranges from large boulders and broken concrete to silty soil particles. 
Densification can be achieved below the water table in pervious and semi-pervious deposits, 
which eliminates costly dewatering and/or lateral bracing systems required for conventional 
excavation and replacement techniques. Dynamic compaction produces ground vibrations 
that can travel significant distances from the point of impact. In urban areas, this may require 
the use of light weight tamper sand low drop heights, as well as limiting dynamic compaction 
to areas well within the property lines. At some sites, shallow isolation trenches have been 
cut through the upper portion of the soil mass to reduce the transmission of energy off site.
Dynamic compaction densifies the soil mass and this in turn, improves its shear strength 
and reduces compressibility. An estimate of improvement in the soil properties shall be made 
before the compaction work is taken up. Soil parameters may be evaluated before and after 
treatment by carrying out Standard Penetration Test (SPT) or Cone Penetration Test (CPT) 
or Pressure Meter Test (PMT) at the requisite number of locations. On this basis it can be 
determined whether dynamic compaction is capable of producing the desired effect.SPT or 
CPT values are used to define the susceptibility of deposit to liquefaction. If the dynamic 
compaction increases the SPT or CPT values of a loose deposit to the required value, then 
the method is deemed to be successful making the soil resistant to liquefaction 
5.2.8.2	
Vibro compaction 
Vibro compaction technique enables the improvement of loose granular deposits up to depths 
of 20m. In this process a metal tube or probe to which an electric motor is attached at the

end is inserted into the ground. The electric motor drives an eccentric weight generating 
vibrations which causes the ground to densify. To assist the penetration of vibrator water is 
jetted through the tip of the probe.
Fig. 5.4 Vibro Compaction Process
Vibro-compaction is effective only in granular, cohesion-less soils. The realignment of the 
sand grains and, therefore, proper densification generally cannot be achieved when the 
granular soil contains more than 10% silt or more than 2% clay.
A more detailed soil analysis may be required for vibro-compaction than for a deep foundation 
project. This is because the vibro-compaction process utilizes the native soil to the full depth 
of treatment to achieve the end result. A comprehensive understanding of the total soil profile 
is therefore necessary. A vibro-compaction investigation will require continuous standard 
penetration tests (SPT), and/or cone penetrometer (CPT), Pressure Meter (PMT) tests, as 
well as gradation tests to verify that the soils are suitable for vibro-compaction. 
5.2.9	
Compaction Grouting
The process of grouting consists of filling pores or cavities in soil or rock with a liquid form 
material to decrease the permeability and improve shear strength by increasing the cohesion 
when it is set. The injected grout pushes the soils to the side as it forms a grout column 
or bulb. The soil becomes increasingly dense as water and/or air are forced out and soil 
particles are rearranged by the incoming grout. Grout injections can be continued until 
grout forces overcome overburden or containment pressures and lift occurs. Compaction 
grouting requires close coordination between the soil properties, grout injection rates, grout 
mix designs, in-situ soil conditions, and equipment capabilities. When compaction grout is 
injected into loose soils, homogenous grout bulbs are formed that displace, densify and thus 
strengthen the surrounding soil. Cement base grout mixes are commonly used for gravely 
soils or fissure rocks. 
5.2.10	
Dynamic Deep Replacement
Dynamic Replacement is an extension of Dynamic Compaction to highly compressible and 
weak soils. In this application, the tamping energy drives granular material down into the 
compressible soils to form large diameter soil reinforcement columns (with diameter around 
2 to 3.5 m). Additional improvement can be obtained in the underlying layers through the

transmission of the energy of the weight at depth. This method thus combines advantages 
from both Dynamic Consolidation and Stone Columns by creating large-sized Dynamic 
Replacement Inclusions with high internal shear resistance. Dynamic Replacement is well 
adapted to substantial loading conditions (up to 150 tons per column) as well as under 
embankments to improve the factor of safety against slope failure. With this technique, 
replacement ratios of up to 20-25% can be achieved. While Vibro Stone Columns have a 
limited range of application is organic soft soils (peat and organic clays), Dynamic Replacement 
Columns can be used in peat or in soils with high organic content without the risk of bulging 
due to their relatively low slenderness (ratio of height over diameter). Construction sequence 
of dynamic replacement is illustrated in Fig. 5.5.
Fig 5.5 Construction Sequence Dynamic Replacement
Dynamic Replacement Columns can increase the time rate of consolidation due to their 
draining potential. 
5.2.11	
Embankments on Soft Ground Using Basal Reinforcement
Embankments on soft ground may be built using stiff layers of geosynthetic reinforcement 
of high strength placed on the ground. To ensure the safety of the embankment in various 
modes of failure, the geosynthetic reinforcement shall have enough tensile strength. This 
technique is more adopted in situations where the clay layer is relatively of shallow depth 
as compared to the base width. The ratio B/D (where B= width of the embankments and 
D= depth of soft clay layer) shall be greater than 4 for any increase in bearing capacity to be 
available. Reference may be made to IRC:113-Guidelines for the Design and Construction of 
geosynthetic reinforced embankments on soft subsoils. The publication also includes number 
of case histories. A representative sketch of Basal reinforced embankment is shown in 
Fig. 5.6. Anchorage Blocks may be provided as shown in Fig 5.6. Alternatively the reinforcing 
layer may be provided with extra length which can be wrapped around the next layer during 
the process of laying and compaction. Reinforced earth walls upto 15 m height were built on 
NH-5 (Now NH-16) in the Godavari Delta stretch, using basal reinforcement, which consisted 
of high strength geo-grid of 200 KN/m with gravel fill between the layers. The project was

Pile Supported Basal Reinforced Embankments on Soft Ground
Embankments on very soft ground may be built ensuring stability as well as minimising 
settlements to very low values by using the system of pile supported embankments. 
Piles are built in the soft clay and geogrid layer is placed on the pile caps. Piles along 
with geo grid layer serve as a support system for the embankment fill. For design details 
refer to BS: 8006. Fig 5.7 illustrates the scheme of pile supported basal reinforced 
embankments.

Widening of Embankments
5.3.1	
Widening of Embankment by Cutting Benches and Filling
The need for widening existing highway embankments by a lane or more is being increasingly 
felt. Figs. 8 (a) & 8 (b) provides a brief description of methodology that may be adopted for 
this purpose. Referring to Fig 8(a) benches may be cut in the slope face. The depth to 
which these benches may be cut may range from 0.75 m to 1 m and width of the bench as 
per existing slope in relation to the depth of the bench. Benches are cut starting from top to 
bottom. The new fill is gradually filled up in layers in the standard manner. Where stability 
of the fill is in doubt, the same may be ensured by providing a soil reinforcement system 
as shown in Fig 8 (a). Geosynthetic having adequate frictional properties as per  MORTH 
section 3100 may be used for this purpose. The number of benches to be reinforced may be 
worked out using standard procedures of slope stability. In particular, planar sliding between 
the earlier slope face and the added fill may be checked.
Fig. 8 (a) Widening of Embankment by cutting Benches and Filling
5.3.2	
Widening of Embankment by using Soil Nailing
In situations where the embankment to be widened exceeds 10 m in height  for considerable 
length, the increased width along with the original embankment may be kept in a stable 
condition by adopting soil nailing technique. Details of the technique are given in MORTH 
section 3200.  Schematic sketch of the same is given below.

Fig. 8 (b) Widening of Embankment using Soil Nailing
Surface of the existing embankment may be cut by a few centimeters or scarified so as to 
make it rough. Lying of the fill may start from ground. The thickness of the first layer as well 
as other layers would depend on the design of soil nail system. At the calculated height first 
nail is driven. Then next layer of fill is placed again at the calculated height and so on. This 
technique may be adopted after taking into consideration of economies.
5.3.3 	
Restoration of Failed Embankments
Failure of embankments occur due to number of reasons and require correct diagnosis for 
choice of remedial/restoration methods. Necessary subsoil investigation and testing needs 
to be carried out and design on the basis of which embankments has been made needs to 
be checked. 
Embankment safety can be achieved by:
	
i)	
Removing some of the weight tending to cause failure or adding fresh material 
to flatten the slope
	
ii)	
By increasing the strength of the soil in the portions where the slip failure 
occurred; and
	
iii)	
By proper drainage and prevention of water percolation in the embankment.
	
iv)	
By providing external support. This can be done by means of retaining wall of 
required height at the toe or providing balancing berms of necessary width.
The two methods described in section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.  may be used to restore failed slopes 
as well. 
In all cases of restoration of failed embankments, slope stability of restored embankment 
shall be checked for the revised configuration.

Additional Ground Improvement Methods
Ground improvement methods discussed in the previous sections improves the bearing 
capacity to a limited extent. Where much higher degree of ground improvement is needed, 
techniques which reinforce the ground have come into practice over the last few decades. 
Ground improvement methods based on reinforcing technique is suited for improving clays, 
silts, and loose silty sands.  Rigid inclusion using controlled modular methods is a proven 
technology since last 30 years as a cost effective alternative to pile foundation system. It is 
used to improve the soil characteristics of a compressible soil layer on a global scale and to 
reduce its compressibility by use of rigid soil reinforcement columns. Unlike a piling solution 
which is designed to support the entire load of the structures on the piles, the objective of 
a rigid inclusion solution is to increase the stiffness of the soil mass to globally reduce both 
total and differential settlements by sharing the load of the structure between the soils and 
the inclusions. Rigid inclusion columns range between 250 to 450 mm dia.
Irrespective of stone columns, rigid inclusions can be used for any types of compressible 
soils, including soils with significant organic contents (Peat, organic clays etc.).The technique 
is more advisable for the projects where construction time plays an important role and can be 
used to the close vicinity of the adjoining structures. 
Preliminary design guidelines of CMCs can be done by using BS 8006 -1& ASIRI (French 
Code). Detail design using FEM Modeling as per the applications need to be done by 
specialized contractors who are having prior experience in taking the project on design and 
build basis.  Post construction load test can be performed ASTM D 1143 – Standard Test 
Method for Deep Foundations under Static Axial Compressive Load.
2. 	
Vacuum Consolidation
Consolidation of compressible soils by vacuum was conceptually introduced in the 1950s 
and has recently evolved as a reasonably reliable technology. The basic premise for vacuum 
consolidation consists of removing atmospheric pressure from a confined sealed soil to be 
consolidated and maintaining the vacuum during a predetermined period of time. The soil is, 
therefore, loaded uniformly throughout its depth by the equivalent 70% of 1 atmosphere as 
shown in Fig.5.9
Vacuum Consolidation method is an atmospheric consolidation system used for preloading 
soft saturated fine-grained soils (clay, silt, peat). The procedure consists of installing a vertical 
and horizontal drain system and vacuum pumping system under an airtight impervious 
membrane. The area is sealed by embedding the membrane into peripheral trenches. These 
trenches are continuously recharged and filled with water to maintain full saturation of the soils 
and to avoid a general lowering of the ground water table within the treatment area. Vacuum 
Consolidation method has been successfully applied since the late 80’s in various types of 
structures and applications (power plants, Sewage treatment plants, highway embankments, 
airport runways). The procedure requires installation of air and water pumping system to 



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
86
create vacuum in the soils below the impervious membrane. Vacuum produced is equivalent 
to a depression of between 60 and 80 kPa, depending on the global efficiency of the system – 
(this pressure is similar to the stress observed under a 3 to 4 m high embankment).
Fig. 5.9 Vacuum Consolidation
Main advantage of Vacuum Consolidation is time savings over other classical consolidation 
methods with surcharge and band drains. Under vacuum consolidation, consolidation period 
usually ranges between 4 and 6 months
In practice, PVDs/Vacuum Consolidation are most commonly used where the soil to be treated 
is moderately to highly compressible with low permeability and fully saturated in its natural 
state and in situations where embankments are routed over long distances on marine clays, 
tidal swamps, peats, creeks etc., where drainage conditions is critical in causing instability, 
and post-construction settlements assume serious proportions. Such soils are typically 
described as silts, clays, organic silts, organic clays, muck, peat, swamps and sludge. 
In general, PVDs/Vacuum Consolidation techniques are best suited for soft saturated and 
normally to slightly over-consolidated soils, prior to loading. The loading should exceed the 
maximum past consolidation pressure to be totally effective.
Field instrumentation, such as piezometers, settlement platforms and inclinometers, are used 
to monitor performance and possibly control the rate of construction of embankment and/or 
surcharge. Settlements measuring devices, deep settlement points are used to measure only 
the rate and total amount of consolidation. For details refer Chapter-6

INSTRUMENTATION AND MONITORING OF EMBANKMENT ON SOFT SOILS 
6.1	
Field Observations/Monitoring 
Experience has shown that safety during construction of embankments over soft sub-soils 
cannot be ensured by only geotechnical investigations and design, since many unforeseen 
factors may arise while the work is in progress which could have profound influence on 
stability. Further, during design of embankments on soft sub-soils, low initial factor of safety is 
adopted for reasons of economy, as the long term factor of safety is anticipated to be higher 
than the initial factor of safety. The increase in the factor of safety over time, takes place 
due to strength gain in the soft clay on the account of consolidation due to loading. Hence 
progress of consolidation of the soil layer beneath the embankment must be monitored. For 
this purpose the following parameters are subjected to close watch:
i)	
Build up and dissipation of pore water pressure
ii)	
Rate and magnitude of the vertical settlement of the sub-soil under the applied 
embankment loads
iii)	
Horizontal spreading of the sub-soil under the applied loads
iv)	
In-situ shear strength 
All the parameters need to be measured periodically at different sections of the embankment. 
The periodicity of measurements and location of the instruments has to be specified in the 
project report. Each of the above parameters when monitored and evaluated gives the 
engineer a clear indication of the state of stability of the embankment and of any variations 
that may be taking place in the same. These parameters also allow an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of ground improvement techniques adopted. 
Impending instability can be detected well in advance and the engineer will have forewarning 
to take steps to arrest the damage. The data can be used to verify whether the embankment 
is in stable state or any impending failure exists. This exercise is based on experience and 
available theoretical considerations. For example, if there is a sudden increase in pore 
water pressure, it is easy to calculate the decrease in the factor of safety and whether such 
decrease likely causes a failure. On the other hand the increase in the magnitude and rate of 
settlements and/or in the rate of lateral movements is indicative of the distress experienced 
in the embankment,  it is not possible at present to specify the limits on either the magnitude 
or the rate of change of movement so as to form a generalized method of control.
Additionally during construction, periodical visual observations should be carried out to 
detect surface tension cracks in the embankment. Usually such cracks which are precursor 
to failure (Fig. 6.1) appear as longitudinal cracks running parallel to lengthwise direction of 
embankment.

In all road projects wherein embankments of height more than one meter are constructed over 
soft clayey unconsolidated soils, having water table at shallow depths, provision should be 
made for installing instrumentation right at the inception of the project i.e. during preparation 
of the Feasibility Report or Detailed Project Report. Adequate resources in the form of money 
and manpower shall be provided to meet the objectives of instrumentation program. It would 
also be advisable to appoint qualified geotechnical engineer assigned by the contractor as 
well as by the supervising agency to ensure that instrumentation program is implemented 
correctly and monitoring/ interpretation of data is done properly.
Fig. 6.1 Typical Failure of Embankment on Soft Sub-soil
The extent of instrumentation for field observations will depend on prevailing site conditions 
and height of embankment proposed in a road project. If a project is large and the construction 
time required is expected to be long, it may be worthwhile going in for as much instrumentation 
as possible in the early phase of construction because, that may permit reduction in size of the 
berms or other features which may reduce the construction costs. Table 6.1 provides details

6.2	
Piezometer
A piezometer is an instrument for measuring pore water pressure. Piezometers are installed 
in the ground to measure the pressure head at different locations in the sub-soil. An ideal 
piezometer is one, which is reliable, sensitive, robust and easy to operate. Many types of 
piezometers are commercially available. 
6.2.1	
Casagrande piezometer (Open tip type - Fig 6.2) is easy to install, simple to operate 
and rugged but has a long response time. Casagrande open standpipe piezometer consist 
of a ceramic porous tip connected to an open standpipe. The ceramic tip is generally of low 
air entry valve, which exhibits very high water permeability. Depending upon the pore water 
pressure existing at the porous tip, water would rise in the standpipe until the hydrostatic 
head of the column of water in the standpipe is equal to the pore water pressure. 
The ceramic tip of Casagrande piezometer is attached to the bottom of un-perforated plastic 
tube and placed at a pre-determined depth. Ceramic tip can be wrapped in geotextile to 
prevent clogging. Monitoring the pore water pressure at designated depth is achieved by 
providing a short response zone of sand backfill around the piezometer tip with a bentonite 
or bentonite-cement mixture seal above. The seal may be in the form of granules, or pellets, 
balls or pumpable grout. It is preferable to backfill the whole of the borehole above and 
below the sand response zone with grout. Installation of Casagrande piezometer is shown in 
Fig. 6.3.

6.2.2	
The vibrating wire piezometer (Fig. 6.4) contains a tensioned stainless steel wire 
attached to a diaphragm. One side of the diaphragm is in contact with the groundwater 
pressure inside through a porous ceramic tip. The other side of the diaphragm is connected to 
atmospheric pressure by an air line. The pore water pressure causes the diaphragm to deflect 
which in turn changes the tension in the steel tension wire, hence its frequency of vibration 
changes. This frequency is calibrated to provide pressure readings. These piezometers have 
a shorter response time as compared to Casagrande piezometer and do not interfere with 
the compaction process.

6.3	
In-situ Shear Strength
In all constructions on soft ground, shear strength is the parameter that directly controls 
the stability. Hence it is important that shear strength is measured at different stages of 
construction of embankment. As the embankment height increases, increase in shear 
strength of the subsoil occurs as the pore water pressure decreases and effective stress 
increases as per theory of consolidation. At the end of each stage of construction, stability 
can be evaluated using new shear strength values. Formulae giving the relationship between 
increase in shear strength of the subsoil and the increase in the effective stress are given in 
IRC-HRB SR:13, Clause 4.2.1.
In practise, the simplest way is to measure in-situ shear strength in the boreholes made for 
this purpose using field vane shear test apparatus.
Combined with the measurement of pore water pressures, in-situ shear strength values 
provide the designers a powerful and reliable tool to monitor the stability of the embankment.
6.4	
Surface Settlement Markers/Settlement Platforms
In the simplest form, the surface settlement markers (settlement platforms) may consist of 
a square steel plate or concrete pad supporting a flange to which a section of pipe, usually 
about 1.5 meter long, is attached (Fig. 6.5). As the fill is built up, additional sections are 
coupled to the pipe. The size of the plate will depend on the material underlying the fill and 
may be from 0.6 to 1.2 m square. The pipes are protected from the surrounding soil by an 
outer PVC or metal pipe casing of appropriate diameter.
Settlement platforms are generally installed on the original ground in accordance with the 
designer’s stipulations. To protect the settlement platform during compaction, temporary 
barrier may be built around it and soil near the platform should be compacted using plate 
compactors to prevent rollers from disturbing the installed position of settlement platform.

6.5	
Magnetic Settlement Gauge
While surface settlement markers measure total settlement of original ground below the 
embankment, magnetic settlement gauges provide data on total surface settlement below the 
embankment and also settlement at various depths of sub-soil layers below the embankment. 
Hence magnetic settlement gauges are referred to as full profile settlement gauges also. 
Magnetic settlement gauge works on the principle that a sensor gets activated when it enters 
a magnetic field axially and can be made to emit a signal (buzzing sound) at the ground level. 
The magnetic ring consists of four arc shaped magnets fixed to four sides of a Perspex ring. 
Each magnetic ring (also called ‘spider’) has four upward leaf springs mounted at intervals 
of 900 around the ring (Figs. 6.6 & 6.7). These magnetic spiders are inserted at pre-decided 
depths around a PVC pipe which also acts as access tube for the probe. The probe is a brass 
rod with a reed switch inside it. The leads of the reed switch are connected with the help of a 
graduated wire to a control box housing an electronic circuit. When the circuit is completed a 
sound signal is generated. The measurements are to be made by inserting the probe, which 
detects the magnet. The exact depth of each magnetic ring can thus be ascertained. The net 
settlement of each magnetic ring can be determined by comparing with the initial levels of 
those magnets similarly recorded earlier.
For installing these gauges, bore holes are made up to hard stratums below the soft soil. One 
end of the PVC access tube is sealed and it is then rested on the hard stratum. Magnetic 
rings (spiders) are installed around the access tube and anchored in the soil around it, to 
enable its displacement along with the surrounding soil. As the sub-soil consolidates and 
settles downwards, spiders also move down. For measuring settlement of original ground, 
magnetic Perspex ring installed in a plastic plate is placed at original ground level below 
the embankment. Downward movement of these spiders and the magnetic plate (placed at 
original ground level) are monitored regularly to obtain settlement data.

Inclinometers
Inclinometers are the devices for monitoring deformation (deflection) normal to the axis of a 
pipe by means of a probe passing along the pipe. Inclinometer system is installed to measure 
extent of horizontal movements/plastic flow inside the sub-soil at various depths. The probe 
contains a gravity sensing transducer (two servo accelerometer) to measure inclination with 
respect to vertical (Fig 6.8). The inclinometer system has four components:
1.	
A permanently installed guide casing (inclinometer pipe) with grooves in two 
perpendicular directions, made of plastic or aluminum alloy. The guide casing 
usually has tracking grooves for controlling orientation of the probe. 
2.	
A portable probe with retractable wheels, containing a gravity sensing transducer 
(Two servo accelerometers fitted inside hollow steel pipe at a distance of 0.5 m 
and then sealed)  
3.	
A portable readout unit with power supply for indication of probe inclination
4.	
A graduated electrical cable linking the probe to a read out unit
The guide casing is installed in the borehole in a near vertical alignment so that the inclinometer 
provides data for measuring lateral deformations of sub-soil. After installation of casing, the 
borehole is backfilled. The grooves of the tube also serve to indicate the direction of the 
readings in relation to the embankment construction. For embankments on soft soils, the 
guide casing should be installed in such a way that one set of grooves are perpendicular to 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
94
the foot of the embankment (lengthwise direction of the embankment). Horizontal movement 
of sub-soil is always measured along this set of the grooves. The probe is lowered to the 
bottom of the borehole and a reading of the tilt is made. Additional readings are made as 
the probe is raised incrementally to the top of the casing, providing data for determination of 
the initial alignment. The difference between initial alignment of the casing and subsequent 
alignment indicates the amount of lateral movement (deflection) of the sub-soil. Since 
horizontal displacement can be sometimes high, it is recommended that the integrity of the 
guide casing be first verified before each monitoring. This is done by lowering a dummy 
probe (without gravity sensing transducers) and pulling it back to avoid losing the actual 
probe. Readings are taken at constant intervals in the ascending direction. Fig. 6.9 shows 
installation of inclinometer. Output of typical inclinometer at the toe of embankment is shown 
in Fig 6.10.

Heave Stake/Pegs
One of the common methods of detecting lateral movement of embankment side slopes is 
provision of heave stakes or pegs (also called displacement markers). These are generally 
installed in a straight line near or beyond toe and top/ side slopes of the embankment in order 
to detect any heave in natural ground or lateral movement of embankment side slope which 
usually precede a shear failure. The most suitable position for these, with reference to the 
slope, would depend upon the type of failure which is anticipated. 
Heave stakes may consist of vertical wooden pegs 50 mm x 100 mm in cross section or a 
pipe section of appropriate length driven into ground with a horizontal cross piece on top. 
Reference marks are put on the vertical and horizontal surface of the stake to aid observation 
about the vertical and horizontal movement. It can have many different designs. Alternatively, 
50 mm x 50 mm x 75 mm timber pegs driven into ground and concrete base if required may 
be provided.
The stakes are normally installed with spacing of 15 to 20 meters on straight reaches. On 
curved section, the spacing may be reduced to 10 meters or less. In straight sections of 
embankment, it is useful to align the stakes in a straight line so that if there is a movement, 
it can be detected even without a surveying instrument by sighting along the line of stakes. 
Normally the movement of stakes is monitored from a survey bench mark located outside 
the zone of disturbance. In most cases, the zone of disturbance will not extend beyond 30m 
from the embankment. Observations are to be made regularly as the construction of the 
embankment progresses.
6.8    	
Construction Monitoring and Control 
Embankments on soft grounds are monitored for assessment of the design assumptions; 
planning of the field work, especially in terms of loading and unloading stages; and to 
ensure the structural integrity of the embankment for preventing failures. As already stated, 
embankments on soft ground are usually designed by considering a lower factor of safety,

since incorporating changes in designed cross section is comparatively easy in earth work. 
Hence safety of the embankment should be controlled by using information obtained from 
installed instruments. In order to achieve the above objectives, some of the important following 
criteria must be met:
	
•	
The magnitude of each type of measurement as well as the range of expected 
variations must be known in advance;
	
•	
The analyses should be performed immediately after taking the readings, to 
provide adequate time for incorporating changes if any in the field works;
	
•	
The plan of instrumentation should inform how and where the instruments 
are to be installed and the recommended frequencies for monitoring.  
6.8.1	
Typical Instrumentation Scheme
In a road project, embankment constructed on soft sub-soil may extend over many kilometers. 
Hence it would be prudent to select 'Typical sections' of about 50 to 70 m length for installation 
of instruments. This would help for easy monitoring and also minimize inconvenience to 
construction activities. The selection of locations for instrumentation shall be governed by 
factors such as height of the embankment, sub-soil properties over the stretch, etc. Usually, 
piezometers and settlement gauges/markers are installed at centre line of the embankment 
while inclinometers are installed near toe of the embankment. Plan view and cross section 
of typical layout for instruments is given in Figs. 6.11 & 6.12. Details about instrumentation 
scheme (locations and number of instruments), monitoring frequency, etc shall be indicated 
in the design report or detailed project report.
It is important that the entire system of recording and monitoring of data from the instruments 
shall be maintained in a computerized form. The system shall provide connection of all the 
instruments through independent cables to a microprocessor based ‘Data Logger’ having 
flexibility of automatic recording of data from individual connection at fixed interval of time.

1.	
Piezometer and vertical settlement gauge should be staggered longitudinally to avoid 
interference with each other.

Initial readings of all the instruments shall be recorded as reference values. Subsequently 
periodic data shall be collected and analyzed. 
Such data recording and analysis shall be taken up by the geotechnical engineer assigned 
to the project and if necessary he should be in close contact to the designer. This will help in 
early identification if any signs of impending failure.
Fig. 6.12 Typical Plan for Instrument Installation in Embankment over Soft Soil
Spacing of Monitoring Instruments
Spacing of various monitoring instruments will depend on factors such as height of 
embankment, depth of soft clay layer, total length of the stretch etc. Hence to a certain 
extent, the designer has to use his engineering judgment. However, as a general guideline 
the following may be kept in mind.
	
a)	
In-situ shear strength and its change with time (due to progress of 
consolidation) shall be monitored every 100 m either by in-situ vane shear or 
taking undisturbed samples and testing them in lab for shear strength, water 
content and void ratio. In either case accuracy and care is essential and all 
precautions regarding recovery of samples from soft clay shall be ensured. 
Samples collected shall be tested without any delay.
	
	
Emphasis is placed on changes in shear strength since this parameter is 
most vital in controlling the rate of construction.
	
b)	
Likewise, it is desirable to measure pore water pressure changes at every 
100 m intervals.
	
c)	
Settlements, heave, lateral movements may be measured at every 200 m.



======================================================================
PAGE 105 of 137
======================================================================
IRC:75-2015
98
If the designer has any reason to believe that there may be problems of settlement/ heave/ 
lateral displacements spacing may be decreased to 100 m. These guidelines may be followed 
for embankments of length upto 1km, where the construction on weak ground extends for 
many kilometres, spacing needs to be adopted keeping in view the changes in height and 
changes in the sub soil profile
6.8.2	
Observational Procedure for Settlement Prediction and Degree of Consolidation
An important aspect of instrumented monitoring of embankments over soft clay pertains to, 
estimation of percentage of consolidation achieved in the sub-soil. The degree of consolidation 
is directly proportional to settlement of sub-soil. Theoretically the settlement of the sub-soil 
can be computed using Terzaghi’s one dimensional consolidation theory. However natural 
clay deposits consist of multilayered soils having different properties. Limited number of 
laboratory tests on sub-soil with respect to consolidation behavior can provide us with only 
local and microscopic information about the ground and the results may be unreliable due 
to sample disturbances. Hence, such variations in the sub-soil properties affect theoretical 
prediction of total settlement. 
To overcome this problem observational procedure of settlement prediction as proposed by 
'Akira Asaoka' (1978) can be adopted. Broadly, this procedure consists of extrapolating the 
settlement values observed in the field to estimate the final (ultimate) total settlement. For 
calculating ultimate total settlement, time vs. settlement curve for the settlement data available 
as on date is first drawn. The total time period in this time-settlement curve is divided into 
convenient number blocks of equal time interval and settlement value at each time interval is 
noted (Fig 6.13). To predict the ultimate total settlement, settlement at particular time interval 
is (St) is plotted along Y axis, while the corresponding settlement for the previous time interval 
(St-1) is taken as X coordinate of such points. These points are joined together to intersect a 
450 line drawn from the origin. The point where this line intersects the 450 line indicates final 
settlement (Fig 6.14). To determine the degree of consolidation achieved, total settlement of 
the ground below the embankment (recorded through surface settlement marker or magnetic 
settlement gauge) as on date is compared with predicted final settlement (as per Asaoka's 
method) and percentage of consolidation is calculated.

6.8.3 	
Control of Embankment Stability
When soft sub-soil is subjected to loading, not only consolidation but also plastic horizontal 
flow (shear deformation) occurs. This makes it difficult to distinguish between the settlement 
occurring due to consolidation and settlement/ displacement due to plastic flow of sub-soil. 
Qualitatively, failure will occur when the progress of the shear deformation (plastic flow of 
sub-soil) is faster than that of consolidation settlement. Hence, if embankment construction 
is carried out at a rapid pace, plastic flow may exceed the rate of consolidation settlement, 
thereby endangering the stability of the embankment. This makes it especially important to 
monitor plastic flow of sub-soil and correlate it with the consolidation settlement. 
While settlement (ρt) at the centre of the embankment can be monitored using settlement 
marker or magnetic settlement gauge, lateral displacement (plastic flow of subsoil) δ of the 
sub-soil can be obtained using inclinometer data. The progress of δ in relation to ρt can 
be used as an indicator of embankment stability and also for any impending failure. Using 
these two parameters, Minoru Matsuo et al (1977) developed an observational method for 
prediction of failure of embankment constructed on soft subsoil. They developed a failure 
prediction diagram based on the settlement data (ρt) and plastic flow of sub-soil (δ) obtained 
from monitoring data for many embankments constructed on soft grounds (Fig 6.15). For

using this diagram to verify the stability of embankment being constructed on soft sub-soils, 
the settlement data (ρt) and plastic sub-soil movement (δ) are to be plotted in the diagram 
(Fig 6.15) for different time intervals. The position where these points lie shows approximate 
Factor of Safety (FOS) of the embankment as on date. In case the points lie very near to 
the FOS line of 1.0 and show a tendency to move further up (where in FOS would be less 
than 1), adequate precautions in the form of stopping further loading/ construction of 
embankment (may be even removing a part of loading) and increasing the frequency of 
recording field monitoring data should be resorted to till the points move further down from 
FOS equal to 1.0 line.

A simple embankment in approach to a bridge is of 12 meter height and has side 
slopes at 45 degrees. The soil is saturated and highly impervious. At present the embankment 
is completely submerged due to backwater flow from a river. Back waters generally recede in 
a short time and eventually the water table recedes to an average level somewhat below the 
toe of the slope.

An embankment having uniform side slopes of 1.5 horizontal to 1 vertical was built 
at a very slow rate to a height of 6 m on rocky foundation with the provision of a toe filter as 
shown in Fig. 3.10. The average effective stress parameters of the embankment material 
(r=2T/m3), were found to be c'=440 kg/m2 and ø'=32°. Determine the stability of the sliding 
mass in terms of effective stress using (a) Swedish Slip Circle Method (b) Bishop Routine 
Method. Assume that the pore water pressures along the potential slip surface are governed 
by the steady state seepage flow net. 
Solution: The sliding mass could be divided into any finite number of vertical slices. In the 
present case, the embankment slope being uniform and its composition being homogeneous, 
seven slices in all, Fig. 1, are considered adequate. 
Stability analysis' in terms of effective stress, in general, requires two basic calculations 
viz., the calculation of the weights of the slices and porewater pressure acting on them. 
The weight vectors could be calculated by multiplying the average height of any slice with 
its average width and unit weight. The pore water pressure values are either available from 
piezometric observations or from steady state seepage flow net. In this case, seepage flow 
net takes the shape shown in Fig.1. 
Based on equations presented in Chapter-3, the calculations using Swedish Slip Circle 
Method and Bishop Routine Method are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. The 
presentation is self-explanatory.
3.  	
A compacted clay fill c' = 0; ø = 28° and γ = 1700 kg/m3) is required to be placed 
above an old embankment, at a uniform slope of 30° with the horizontal in order to meet the 
renewed requirements of grade and top width. Examine the stability of the newly placed fill, in 
terms of effective stress, along the interface c' = 0; ø= 19°) using Janbu's Method. Compare 
the results with those obtained if, interfacial sliding is inhibited and, failure is considered 
possible only by sliding within the compacted Clay fill. Assume the piezometric head on 
the surface of sliding as shown in Fig. 2. What would be the corresponding results if the 
piezometric head is to drop down to zero all along the slip surface? 
Solution
The problem involves effective stress analysis on a non-circular slip surface using the method 
suggested by Janbu. Porewater pressure conditions have been defined in Fig. 2. 
The calculations corresponding to two cases, viz., (a) porewater pressures as defined by 
the piezometric head (b) zero pore water pressure, are furnished in two separate Tables in 
Fig. 32. These calculations are self explanatory. 
It must be noted that, if interfacial sliding is prevented, the factor of safety improves. Towards 
this effect, it helps to provide suitably cut benches (discontinuous boundary between the 
old and the new fill) which improve the shearing resistance of the sliding mass along the 
interface.

A clay layer, 9m thick, is underlain by impervious rock and is covered with free 
drainage sand. Laboratory consolidation test on a 2.5 cm thick sample, obtained from the 
clay layer, requires 500 seconds for 50 percent consolidation. The laboratory sample was 
drained both at top and at bottom. Calculate the time required for 50 percent consolidation in 
the field.
Solution: The value of dimensionless time factor, T, for 50 percent consolidation both in the 
field and the laboratory is the same.

Since, the permeability of clayey soil are very low, it requires much more time for the

Hence, from the above calculation it is seen that the process of consolidation is accelerated 
using PVDs, which saves time and is a practically feasible solution.
Bearing Capacity Considerations
If the bearing capacity is not adequate to carry the required height of embankment, stage 
construction in conjunction with PVDs may be adopted.
The design will be based on gain in shear strength in each stage being used to build the next 
stage. Execution time for construction of embankment has to be worked out taking in to the 
consideration time taken to achieve required shear strength which is a function of degree of 
consolidation. 
Following equation given by Skempton’s formula, which is based on plasticity index of soil, 
may be adopted to find the enhanced cohesion value.
Gain in strength, cohesion component, Δc = k x U x Δσ  	
	
	
      … Eqn 2
Enhanced cohesion cf = ci+Δc	
	
	
	
	
	
	
      … Eqn 3
ci = Initial cohesion value
Where, k = 0.11 + 0.0037 x PI	
	
	
	
	
	
	
      … Eqn 4
U= Degree of consolidation
Δσ = increased overburden pressure (Due to embankment construction)
In the example given below an embankment of 8m height is designed to be built on a soft clay 
layer of 7 m thick using PVD’s with stage construction. 
Input Parameters for Embankment
Top width of embankment=24 m
Height of embankment = 8 m
Side slopes= 1V:2H
Unit weight of fill material= 18kN/m3
Thickness of soft clay layer= 7 m, this layer is followed by hard stratum
Properties of soft clay
c=14kN/m2
Liquid limit=70%
Plastic limit= 39%
Calculation of Bearing Capacity
Base width of embankment (B) = 56 m
Depth of soft clay (D) = 7 m
B/D=8
Nc= 4.14 +0.5 x B/D = 8.14 (As per IRC-75)	
	
	
	
	
      ….Eqn 5.



======================================================================
PAGE 124 of 137
======================================================================

IRC:75-2015
117
Bearing Capacity of clay layer= 114 kN/m2
Load due to embankment= 8 x 18= 144 kN/m2
Hence soil will not be able to take the entire load of 8m embankment in single stage; hence 
two stage construction will be adopted with use of PVD’s to reduce the waiting period.
First Stage Construction (Assume 4m will be built)
For 4 m height of embankment FOS in bearing capacity = (8.14 x 14)/ (4 x18) = 1.58
Hence 4 m high embankment can be built in the first stage.
Assume PVD’s have been installed before the initial stage of construction.
Required bearing capacity for 8m high embankment= 144 x 1.25= 180 kN/m2
Provide 6 months waiting period after the first stage of embankment is built which is time 
required for achieving 90% consolidation, as per Table 5.1 given by Hansbo
Bearing Capacity for Second Stage
In order to check the bearing capacity for second stage of embankment gain in strength due 
to first stage surcharge load is calculated using Skempton’s formula ref IRC: HRB -13
Gain in strength due to consolidation, cohesion component, Δc = k x U x Δσ
Enhanced cohesion cf = cI+ Δc
	
cI = Initial cohesion value
Where,	
k = 0.11 + 0.0037 x PI
	
U = Degree of consolidation (90% in this case)
	
Δσ = increased overburden pressure (Due to embankment construction)
In this case K= 0.11 + 0.0037 x 39= 0.254
Hence Δc= 0.254 x 0.9 x 72 = 16.45 kN/m2
Hence total cohesion available at the end of first stage waiting period = 14+ 16.45 =30.45 
kN/m2
Bearing capacity = 8.14 x 30.45= 247. 90kN/m2 (As per eqn 5.)
Load acting on subsoil for 8m high embankment is 144 kN/m2
Hence FOS=247. 90/144 = 1.7 is more than minimum required. Hence the design is 
satisfactory.
Increase in strength due to 8m embankment will be (after 2nd stage waiting period) due to 
additional 4 m embankment
	
Δc= 16.45 kN/m2
Hence, Total cohesion available = 14 + 16.45 + 16.45 = 46.9 kN/m2

Hence combined degree of consolidation is 91.5%

Residual settlement of 80mm will decrease very slowly, since time Vs consolidation 
relationship becomes asymptotic at this point. This settlement is within the tolerable limits of 
300 mm and hence allowable.

Design cohesion values at the end of each stage waiting period are given below. These 
values are given in the calculation of rotational stability at the appropriate stage.

Note:
1.	
In all the calculations the waiting period has been rounded off to 6 months, instead 
of the calculated value of 5.45 months (see Table 6)

2.	
It is assumed that the fill in each stage is placed in a relatively short time. Hence 
waiting period starts after the design fill height has been placed. i.e. some strength 
increase that will occur during the period required to place the fill is not taken into 
consideration. This is on the conservative side. However, it must be ensured at no 
stage, the F.O.S is below safe value.
3.	
It is essential that increase in shear strength and progress of settlement are 
monitored (see chapter. 6).
Good Construction Practices that may be Adopted
1.	
Granular blanket of 500 mm thickness may be placed on the soft ground. The 
granular blanket shall extend 500 mm beyond full width of embankment on either 
side including the additional PVDs provided at toe.
2.	
A layer of separator geotextile shall be placed above the soft clay, before the 
gravel layer is placed. Likewise a layer of separator geotextile may be placed 
between the bottom of the embankment fill and the gravel layer. The steps will 
ensure free drainage of gravel blanket and keep it free from contamination.
3.	
One layer of biaxial geogrid of 100kN x 100kN (minimum) ultimate tensile strength 
may be placed at the middle of the gravel layer. This will provide some rigidity to 
the gravel layer and uniformity of contact.
4.	
Minimum 3 rows of PVDs shall be provided beyond either toe. This will help provide 
lateral support at the toe.

Capacity based on bearing support by intervening soil	
	
	
	
Area of intervening soil for each column, Ag = A  - As	
	
	
	
= 4.626 m2	
	
Safe load taken by intervening soil, Q3 = qsafe*Ag	 	
	
	
= 237.80 kN	
	
Hence total safe load = A + B + C Q	 = 507.39 kN	
	
Now, Meyerhoff's stress for 6 m high Embankment = 108 kN/m2 
	
(6m height, 18 kN/m3 as unit weight, no	
	
Area of ground improvement  AGI = L x B ecc.)	
	
 	
	
= 10000 m2 Say 100 m x 100 m
	
Total load on the ground, Load T  = σ x AGI	
	
	
= 1080000 kN	
Hence, for this load on ground and available Q safe of ground let’s do back calculation to 
check if spacing is sufficient
	
Number of stone columns N= Load T/Q
	
	
2128.552 No.	
	
Therefore area per column Asc= AGI/N	
	
	
	
= 4.698 m2	
	
	
Now, using the (De =1.05 x S) for this area		
	
	
S=sqrt(4x Ac/(3.14 x 1.05 2)) = 2.329 m c/c	
Since, the assumed spacing is greater than final spacing, Hence, we need to decrease the 
spacing of stone column and redo the calculation.
2nd Approximation of Design:
Let’s consider triangular design pattern with following governing design parameters.
	
Diameter of stone column, D	 = 1 Assume
	
Spacing, S = 2.15 Assume
	
Column Pattern	 =  Triangular	
	
Area of stone column, As  = 0.785 m2

Calculation:
	
A. 	
Capacity based on bulging of column
	
Limiting axial stress in column σv = σrL* kpcol	
	
	
	
	
	
Where, σrL = Limiting radial stress		
	
	
σrL = (σro +4cu)*kpcol		
	
	
	
Where, σro = koσvo (Initial effective stress)	
	
	
For, this problem,	
	
	
	
	
	
	
kpcol = tan2(45o + φcolumn/2)		
	
	
	
kpcol = 4.60

σvo = 2γD = 11.58	
	
	
	
	
	
Now,	 	
	
	
	
	
Limiting radial stress, σrL = (σro +4cu)*kpcol	
	
	
	
	
513.15 kN/m2

Increase in ultimate cavity expansion stress radial stress =

Where, Fq' = 1, for φ = 0

Capacity based on bearing support by intervening soil	
	
	
	
Area of intervening soil for each column, Ag = A  - As 
	
	
= 3.217 m2	
	
	
	
Safe load taken by intervening soil, Q3 = qsafe*Ag	 	
	
	
= 165.37  kN
	
Hence total safe load = A + B + C	
	
	
	
	
Q = 434.95 kN
	
Now, Meyerhoff's stress for 6 m high Embankment = 108 kN/m2 (6m height, 18 
kN/m3 as unit weight
	
Area of ground improvement  AGI = L x B)
	
=	 10000 m2 Say 100 m x 100 m
	
Total load on the ground, Load T = σ x AGI 1080000 kN
Hence, for this load on ground and available Q safe of ground let’s do back calculation to 
check if spacing is sufficient
	
Number of stone columns N= Load T/Q
	
	
2483.035 No.	
	
Therefore area per column Asc = AGI/N	
	
= 4.027 m2	
	
Now, using the (De =1.05 x S)for this area	 	
	
	
S=sqrt(4x Ac/(3.14 x 1.05^2)) = 2.157 m c/c	
Since, the assumed spacing is matching with the final calculation. Hence, this design 
represents the optimum design of stone column.
	
Design summary	
	
Diameter of stone column, D = 1.00	
	
	
Spacing, S =	2.15

Net settlements after ground improvement = 0.24 x 1147

Since stone columns also acts as drains these settlements will decrease further rapidly as 
they are closely spaced. Stone columns must be tested for load bearing capacity as stated 
in I.S 15284 clause 9.3.2
All the good construction practices mentioned under PVDs shall be adopted for stone 
columns.
