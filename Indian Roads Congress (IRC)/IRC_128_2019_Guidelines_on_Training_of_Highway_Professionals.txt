guidelines on training of highway professionals
INTRODUCTION
Developed infrastructure provides strong backbone for sustainable socio-economic development 
of a Nation and Highways being the most important infrastructure, form the arteries of economic 
development. Therefore, construction of good highway infrastructure along with sustainable 
environment is the need of the hour for economic development of the country. India is one of the 
fast developing economies of the World. It has a large network of roads and includes 1,32,500 
km of National Highways, 1,56,694 km of State Highways and vast network of Rural and Other 
Roads aggregating to about 56,08,477 km. The development and requirement of roads was well 
emphasized by the Planning Commission of India under the 12th Five Year Plan. An amount of 
Rs. 9,14,536 crore was projected for the Road Sector. Annually an amount of over Rs. 1,25,000 
crore is spent in development of National Highways only.
For meeting the requirements of the development of road infrastructure, there is huge necessity 
of qualified technical manpower having expertise in various fields of Highways and Bridges viz. 
Planning, Design, Construction and Maintenance etc. Taking into consideration the available 
facilities for development of skill and expertise, there exists a gap between the requirement and 
availability of training institutes as well as faculties in the road sector. In fact, a number of training 
courses being run by different institutes, are much less than the requirements. Engineering 
professionals need to gain knowledge in many areas which may not be part of their engineering 
studies, especially Law, Financial Norms, International Funding, Policy Planning for PPP Projects 
and Model Contract Conditions as per International practice etc.
In view of the above, this document has been prepared by the Human Resources Development 
Committee (G-2) concerned with Human Resource Development in the road sector. It is hoped 
that this document will be useful for developing course material and curriculum for various training 
courses and may help in bridging  the gap in the training needs of road sector engineers as well 
as professionals.  With trained professionals, there is bound to be qualitative and quantitative 
improvement in the delivery of road projects.
The document is a follow-up of the main document on IRC:SP:92-2010 “Road Map for Human 
Resource Development in Highway Sector”.  
Other human resources working for highway sector includes workmen, operators etc. for which 
another document entitled IRC:127-2018 “Guidelines on Skill Development of Workmen in Road 
Sector” may be referred to. 
The G-2 Committee (personnel given below) in its 6th meeting held on 14th June, 2016 approved 
this document for submission to the GSS Committee. The GSS Committee in its meeting 
held on 24th June, 2017 after deliberations, referred the document to Sub-Group of GSS 
constituted comprising CE, S,R&T(R), MoRTH, Director, IAHE, Shri K.B. Rajoria, Convenor, 
G-2 Committee & Shri B.N. Singh, Co-Convenor, GSS Committee to look into matter and 
reframe the document covering all aspects as discussed in the meeting while keeping harmony 
with MoRTH policy on training. The document was discussed in a number of meetings by 
Sub-Group and the Sub-Group in its meeting held on 19.01.2018 finalized the draft document for

onward submission to GSS Committee. The document was approved by the GSS Committee in 
its meeting held on 25.04.2018 for placing before the Council for its consideration. The Council 
in its 215th meeting held on 4th May, 2018 at Aizawl (Mizoram) after deliberations authorized the 
Executive Committee to take final call about Publishing of the document. The Executive in its 
meeting held on 4th August, 2018 approved the document for publishing.

elaborated and finalized by the Committee. Contribution of some members is also worth 
mentioning which include Shri O.P. Goel, DG (Retd), CPWD, Shri V.S. Khaira, SE, MoRTH, 
Shri V.K. Sharma, CE, CPWD and Shri S.P. Banwait, ADG (Retd.), CPWD. During 5th meeting of 
G-2 Committee held on 16.05.2016, some additional suggestions were given by Shri D.P. Gupta 
about tunneling, Shri Kondai Bikshapathi, DG, National Academy of Construction Hyderabad, 
suggested to add about Knowledge Management System and Shri D.B. Vyas, Joint Director, 
STC, Gandhinagar suggested to mention about Highway Aesthetics/ Landscaping Architecture 
in the document. These suggestions have also been incorporated in the document.
The Officers of the S&R Zone of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways especially 
Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure, SE have scrupulously revised the document by adding supplementary 
text, reorganization, editing and proof reading which has resulted the document in the present 
form.
In Chapter 1 the necessity of professional development has been described. The seminal 
document of G-2 Committee, road map for delineated training needs and implementation 
framework are also given in Chapter 1. Training is different from basic engineering. The training 
institutes must appreciate and differentiate the two. It is to be appreciated that a fresh graduate 
or diploma in civil engineering or highway engineering, needs inputs in different fields related to 
roads & bridges from inception to operation and maintenance.
Chapter 2 deals with Career Development in the road sector. In Chapter 3, the broad scope of 
training areas is given. It covers engineering, codes and schedules, knowledge of skills, laws 
of land, foreign funding, project development etc. Chapter 4 gives broad outline of Induction 
or Entry Level Training. Chapter 5 describes training requirements at Junior and Middle Level 
Engineers. The Government Engineers of the level of or professionals Assistant Engineer, 
Assistant Executive Engineer, Executive Engineer and also their equivalents namely Deputy 
managers, Managers, Deputy General Managers in Public Undertakings, Contractors and 
Consultants are covered in this group. Chapter 6 gives training needs of Senior Middle Level 
Engineers i.e. Superintending Engineers/Additional Chief Engineers and Chief Engineers which 
are equivalent to General Manages/Chief General Managers of Public Undertaking, Contractors 
and Consultants. Chapter 7 gives training requirements of top level engineers, professionals 
and administrators etc. The Heads of Departments of Engineering/Public Organizations, Policy 
Professionals and Administrators in the Government and Heads of Private Sector Organizations 
are covered in this group. As a policy, all professionals working in the highway sector must get 
trained in their field of working at all levels including at entry level. Chapter 8 gives brief details 
on organizing the training.

CHAPTER 1
NECESSITY FOR TRAINING
1.1	
The IRC has developed Standards, Specifications, Guidelines and Codes of Practice 
in almost all conceivable areas relating to Highways & Bridges. It is seen that there is a visible 
gap between the laid down Standards and Practice followed for actual execution. There is a gap 
between ‘what should have been’ and ‘what has been done’. The IRC:SP:92-2010 “Road Map 
for Human Resource Development in Highway Sector” has delineated training needs and how 
the same is to be imparted within the overall ambit of organizational development. “The Road 
Development Plan and Vision 2021” document of Government of India has laid emphasis on the 
capacity building of various stakeholder organizations which include strengthening of decision 
support system by way of development of strong data base, specialization of professionals, 
re-engineering of Organizations for sound decision making, synchronization of working in the 
organizational set up and development of skilled man power. These objectives require that 
Highway Professionals are trained in such a way that their skills and knowledge synchronizes 
with the necessity of country at present as well as in future for developing world class highway 
network. As a follow up of the above objectives, these “Guidelines on Training of Highway 
Professionals” have been made. The identified training areas where Highway Professionals are 
required to be given exhaustive exposure so that they can perform their tasks as expected and 
in conformity with the laid down Standards and Specifications are enumerated. These training 
areas are supposed to acquaint Highways Professionals to the varied complexities and intricacies 
needed that are to be taken into consideration either while making a decision or while executing 
construction works of roads, bridges etc.
1.2	
The objective of identifying training areas is to create conditions so that all those who 
are involved in road infrastructure in the country should understand as to what they are doing 
and what they are expected to do. These training modules would help in minimizing the gap 
between what one knows and what one is expected to know. 
1.3	
Training modules will however have to be suitably modelled depending upon the 
nature of the target group for Officers at three levels, i.e., (i) Junior/Entry Level, (ii) Middle Level, 
and (iii) Senior/Top Level.
1.4	
It is hoped that the training areas prescribed will be immensely useful to all those 
working in the Ministries and Road Development Organizations both in the Central and 
State Governments as well as Private Construction Agencies, Laboratories, Consultants, 
Concessionaire, Environmentalists and even Public Representatives engaged in some way or 
the other with highway planning, development, construction and maintenance. 
1.5	
Approach of training in the sphere of roads & bridges including R&D shall be multi-
disciplinary to know how to minimize resources, increase output & efficiency in an optimal 
manner. One must know the role and responsibilities to attain the highest achievement in not 
only quantity but quality with integrity. Professionals are to be encouraged & incentivized to take 
field as well as R&D activities.

CHAPTER 2
CAREER DEVELOPMENT
2.1	
Professionals joining highway sector in Government Organizations or Private Agencies 
after graduation or diploma in Engineering are assigned specific tasks. They have background of 
engineering studies but that is not considered adequate for performing the assigned task in an 
expected manner. To some extent, guidance can be given by seniors in the Organization, but it is 
not adequate to perform effectively. Therefore, it is essential that practical knowledge is imparted 
by trainers, who have the background of practice of engineering in specific areas of highways & 
bridges. Professionals have to acquire the requisite skills by getting trained at different periods 
of their career development.
2.2	
Training of engineering professionals at different levels, as a part of career growth 
is necessary and essential not only for the individual but for the Organization as well. It 
may be made mandatory for all the Organizations to impart the induction training of around 
6 months at their own training facilities or central institutes like IAHE/CRRI.
This training is to be imparted in such a manner that every individual gets personal attention of 
the trainer. Therefore, number of trainees in a class should be limited and preferably in the range 
of 20-25. The trainer must have background of professional work. For learning and attending 
required level of proficiency, trainer and trainee have to intercommunicate during training. For 
their guidance, different steps to be followed have been detailed below:
	
i)	
Tell the trainee what to do.
	
ii)	
Show the trainee what to do.
	
iii)	
Make him tell what he has to do.
	
iv)	
Tell the trainee how to do.
	
v)	
Show the trainee how to do.
	
vi)	
Show the trainee why to do.
	
vii)	
The trainee should tell what he has to do. 
	
viii)	 The trainee should tell how he will do.
	
ix)	
The trainee should tell why he has to do.
	
x)	
Let trainee do the job by working on practical exercise.
	
xi)	
Let trainee improve the job with the intervention and interaction with the trainer.
	
xii)	
Let the trainee practice to the extent that skills are acquired, and.
	
xiii)	 Let the trainer check and acknowledge that trainees have acquired the knowledge 
and skills.
2.3	
The broad horizons for training have to extend much beyond acquiring skills and 
knowledge. The skills acquired are to be utilized in doing the assigned task and its management. 
Modern management concepts propagate individuals’ involvement beyond mind. It has to extend 
to heart and soul. Imparting training by covering all the aspects will raise sphere of knowledge 
and training will be useful not merely for performance of task but making individuals as better 
human beings.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:128-2019

2.4	
Training is not meant for development of robot of whom no further development is 
possible. Prime objective is to enhance the skill to implement the theory into practice and not 
that what a particular individual / group is intended to do in an organization. Training is meant not 
only for development of expertise but also for character development.
2.5	
It may not be out of place to mention that highway engineers have to develop the 
habit of acquiring knowledge throughout their career and beyond. Therefore, one has to keep in 
touch with the professional knowledge by reading and referring to the latest books and journals 
on the subject. Besides, in order to enlarge prospect of knowledge and skills, frequent field 
visits are also necessary. Simultaneously, acquired knowledge and skills need to be shared. 
For this purpose, Highway Engineers should attend Conferences, Seminars, Workshops etc. 
both as delegates and presenters. With the passage of time, the trainee may have to develop 
himself as a trainer. It must be understood that keeping knowledge to self only deprives others. 
The practical knowledge if propagated and shared will benefit the public in general and highway 
sector in particular. Therefore, Engineers should feel encouraged to write papers, articles and 
books.
2.6	
All the Professionals should be encouraged and incentivized to acquire higher 
qualifications.

CHAPTER 3
SCOPE OF TRAINING
3.1	
Knowledge horizons of Highway Engineers have to be continuously and consistently 
expanded & upgraded as they move up the ladder in their career. While no boundary conditions 
for acquiring the knowledge can be defined, efforts have been made to identify areas where the 
highway engineers need to acquaint themselves during different stages of their career in various 
facets of highway & bridges. Imparting of practical technical knowledge to professionals has to 
be done as a part of human resource development within the framework of requirements of the 
Organization. Thus, human resource development and management exercise has to be initiated 
by the employer organizations for training of professionals.   
3.2

3.4	
Skills: Skill development is a recurring need and not a onetime affair. New technologies 
could be a game changer in skill development. Engineering Professionals are about 5 % of total 
manpower directly working in Highway Sector. Balance 95% include supporting staff in offices, 
Skilled and Unskilled Workers, Surveyors, Safety Officials, Field Laboratory Staff, Computer 
Operators, Store keepers, Supervisors, Machine Operators, Scaffolders etc. It is necessary that 
Highway Professionals also acquire basic knowledge about job requirements of work force. 
Various skills to be acquired may include but not limited to:
	
i)	
Material Testing
	
ii)	
Basics of Equipments and Machineries
	
iii)	
Information Technology
	
iv)	
Management Skills
	
v)	
Communication Skills
	
vi)	
Human Behavior, Stress & Self Management
	
vii)	
Noting, Drafting & Report Writing Skills 
Skills shall create potential for new jobs and enhance income. Mapping of capacities and 
accreditation of training institutions and agencies may be done in order to assess the quality of 
Trainers and Training Materials.
3.5	
Constitution of Bylaws: Requisite knowledge is necessary about constitution and 
laws particularly in the context of obligations to be fulfilled by National & International Laws. 
Besides, knowledge of Contract Act/ Arbitration Act and Limitation Act is particularly required for 
dealing with Contracts and Arbitrations. Moreover, several Acts and related rules and regulations 
are concerning highway profession, such as National Highways Act, CRF Act, LA Act, CMV Act, 
Control of Land and Traffic Act etc. Besides, there are Acts related to State Highways, Rural 
Roads etc. It is necessary that Highway Professionals are familiar with the provisions of these 
Acts.
3.6	
Foreign Funding Professionals and National/ State Level Programmes: It is 
necessary to have knowledge about various international funding agencies like IRDB, ADB, 
JICA, BRICS, EU etc. their policies, programmes and procedures. The procedure for operation 
of the funds as budgeted in the Government is also necessary.
3.7	
Project Development & Implementation: A project has to pass through different 
stages and the Highway Professionals ought to know implementation & operation of these 
stages. The broad list of these stages is as below:
	
i)	
Preliminary Proposal, Budgeting and Approval
	
ii)

CHAPTER 8
ORGANIZING TRAINING
8.1	
Training Areas as brought out in this document covers highways sector. 
Therefore, Government Organizations, Public Undertakings, Private Construction Companies, 
Consultancy Firms and other organizations related with this Sector should consider organizing 
training courses with the help of details given. The HR Department of an organization has to 
develop details for training to be imparted to different professionals at top to junior most level. In 
case in-house Training facilities are available in the organization, it should plan training activities, 
in consultation with top management and HR Department. In case, the Organization does not 
have training facilities, the HR Department should nominate one Middle Level Professional as 
training coordinator who should work under the direction of one senior level nominated for this 
purpose by the Government/Private Sector. The training may be organized at IAHE, CRRI, IITs/
NITs/IIMs etc.
8.2	
As per objectives of the Organization, it is necessary to establish training needs. That 
is, at different level and for different tasks to be performed by Professionals, details of training 
needs should be worked out. Training Areas, given in different chapters will help in working out 
training needs. Any subject not mentioned in this documentation can also be included under 
training needs. In order to give guidance for working out training programmes, broad concept 
of training programmes and their duration has been brought out to be minimum. This should be 
reviewed, modified and enhanced as per specific requirement.
8.3	
Training after joining the Organization: Chapter 4 gives details of areas which 
should be included in entry level training. The period for class room training can be three to 
four months. Thereafter, trainees should visit and learn from Incharge of different units of the 
organization. For each unit 3 days to 6 days are considered adequate. Trainees should record 
notes, which should be reviewed by training Incharge. Total training period at entry level should 
be at least six months, depending on necessity of organization. 
8.4	
Training on promotion: After promotion to higher level, there is a need for change 
in outlook and widening of horizons. Besides, shift has to be from detailing to comprehensive 
outlook. One who has worked at junior level, has to think beyond for achieving objective of the 
Organization. Training Areas have been brought at in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 for Junior/Middle level, 
Senior level and Top levels respectively. Depending on necessity of the organization, training 
subjects and duration should be selected. This training should be of one to four weeks duration. 
8.5 
Training for Specific Job Requirements: At times, specific tasks are to be performed 
such as procurement of equipment, scrutiny of International and bi-lateral proposals, new 
technology etc. For such assignment, it is necessary to impart specialized training to selected 
individuals. Besides, whenever someone is shifted from one department to another department 
dealing in different type of tasks, training should be imparted. At times, for design work, specific 
specialized training is necessary. After induction training, at least 2 trainings per year of one 
week duration, is a must for all the professionals.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:128-2019
23
8.6 
Project Specific Workshops: It is necessary that project specific workshops are 
arranged as per necessity of the project. This includes different aspects such as safety, value 
engineering, quality systems etc. Such workshops should normally be multi-level and multi-
disciplinary.
8.7	
Planning of Training Programmes: For Organizations having training institutes, 
training programmes for whole year can be planned, with faculty within training institute, within 
Organization or external. Where training institutes do not exist, this exercise has to be done by 
HR Department. While planning training programmes, help of other training institutes may be 
taken. The Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE) should play an important role and its 
training programmes to be dovetailed with training needs of Organization. Similarly, CRRI is also 
organizing training programmes which are to be shared for the benefit of Organizations.
8.8 
Certifications: Certification for training should be correlated to increments 
and promotions, as per specific necessity of an Organization. Basically training is to be 
taken seriously by individuals for their career development and also for growth of the Organization.
8.9	
Nominations for Seminars, Workshops, and Conferences at National/International 
level shall be considered as a part of training. Encouragement & Incentives to be given to 
Professionals/Engineers who are interested in R&D. They may be given an increment, study 
leave, early promotions, tours/emoluments on the basis of achievement and contribution made 
to the Organization.
