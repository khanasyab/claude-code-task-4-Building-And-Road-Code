FOREWORD
Government of India has taken a mission to develop a National Expressway Network
dedicated to provide road infrastructure comparable to the world standards, recognizing
the importance of providing high-speed facilities connecting ports, major cities, industrial/
agricultural centers and major markets to the significant economic growth. Construction
of fully access controlled expressways for 1000 km under National Highways Development
Program (NHDP) Phase VI are about to be launched.
Accountability for providing safe, reliable and user comfortable road network utimately
rests with the Government. It is, therefore, essential that the Guidelines for Expressways
laid down for development of expressways should cover sound engineering practices,
safety features and amenities for the users.
Ministry took up the preparation of the Guidelines for Expressways through technical
cooperation from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and constituted a
Technical Committee comprising of the following officers for its finilization:
1
Sh. Nirmal Jit Singh, Director General (Road Development) and
Chairman

The Guidelines for Expressways, as prepared, highlights appropriate planning and design
principles for promoting safety conscious planning and design and will go a long way in
guiding the highway engineers and planners to make our expressways safer, comfortable
and of international standards.
Guidelines have been structured in four (4) volumes :
Volume - I
:
Planning
Volume - II
:
Design
Volume - III
:
Operations and Management
Volume - IV
:
Maintenance
The intended users of this guideline will be the transportation professionals/engineers
who participate in or are responsible for any phase in the project preparation of the
Expressway Project. This includes all public or private “practitioners” (e.g. managers,
supervisors, engineers, planners, or technicians) who are involved with any issue or
decision (e.g. managers, supervisors, engineers, planners, or technicians) who are involved
with any issue or decision (e.g. legislation, policy, program, funding, operation &
management and maintenance scenario) that may directly or indirectly infuence the
performance of an Expressway facility.
In planning design process, the Highway Engineer strives to develop, within the limits of
given constraints, the dimensional layout or geometric configuration that will lead to high
level of safety, efficiency and ease in driving. Therefore, the intent of this document is to
provide guidance to the designer with the critical aspects of project preparation for an
expressway. This guideline is dynamic in nature and the users, based on their experience,
give appropriate feedback so as to enable the Guidelines to be revised/improved from
time to time.

VOLUME – III : OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Document Volume-III: Operations and Management is complementary to other
guideline volumes.  The objective of this document is to assist the design engineer in
project preparation for the identified sections of “National Expressway Network”.
The contents of this document are necessarily a compilation on illustrative requirements
which are generally not covered by the available documents/practices. The intended users
of this document will be the Expressway professionals/engineers.
This document has been structured into 3 (three) chapters as follows:
Chapter – 1
:
Toll Plaza Operation
Chapter – 2
:
Traffic Management
Chapter – 3
:
Service Area Management
Chapter – 1
:
Toll Plaza Operation
This chapter provides relevant aspects of toll plaza operations in a holistic manner.  The
toll plaza at various interchange locations have different toll lane requirements involving
various methods of collection viz. Manual, Smart Card and ETC.
For a closed toll system, the collection methodology deliberates ticketing systems, toll
collection methods and toll gate operations.  Operations in toll plaza cover the aspects
and activities at entry and exit; control of over loaded/over sized vehicles along with
regulatory authorities for imposing necessary legal/penal measures. Activities for
alleviating traffic congestion including measures such as flexible gate opening, capacity
enhancement, organizations, and responsibilities along with occasions for surprise
checking have been covered.
Traffic safety measures include signage, road markings, safety cushions at gore areas,
ETC related safety measures and toll area safety including provisions for utility and turn
around provisions for emergency vehicles.
Additional safety measures dealt features (not mandatory but desirable) to enhance safety
of toll operators, toll lane inspectors.  This include adequate information to drivers/users,

push button / alarm switch inside toll booth, wide signage over toll booth along with flashing
spindle, safety ropes and safety bars between toll lanes and provision of air conditioning
facilities inside booth. Security at toll plaza mainly deliberates on overall safety of the
plaza area.
Audit section describes the general procedures and the frequently met aspects of
monitoring toll collection data and associated counter measures.
Counter measures for toll evasion covers measures for control on “ticket exchange” and
preventing/minimizing “passing through toll gate without paying (Tailgating)”.
Chapter – 2  :  Traffic Management
This chapter has been presented under two broad heads viz. Traffic Control and Incident
Management.
Traffic Control section deliberates on (i) Information collection includes emergency
communication system; mobile communication system, meteorological data system,
automatic traffic counters cum classifiers system, closed circuit television, transmission
system and vehicles for route patrol. (ii) Control center which comprises of traffic
management center, facility control center and disaster control center which inter-alia
include natural disasters. (iii) Information dissemination deliberates on types of information
and the medium such as variable message signs, portable VMS – on vehicles, highway
advisory radio, internet or mobile services, and Vehicle Information and Communication
System (VICS).
Incident Management section covers aspects of (i) traffic accident, (ii) bad weather,
(iii) current practices, methods, strategies and technologies.
Chapter – 3  :  Service Area Management
The conventional development of road side amenities and rest areas is no longer being
considered as free facilities for the toll roads.   The current global trend is to commercialize
these facilities, and service areas.  New developments in this regard are as follows:
-
Administration for service area covers on organisation and risk sharing
between the expressway authority and the concessionaires.  This has been
discussed using current Japan scenario for developing under Indian
scenario.



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 316
======================================================================

-
Customer services include provision for high quality services and facilities
to the expressway users.  This includes traffic information, local tourist
information, facilities for Persons with Disability (PwD), and services
available for comfortable and enjoyable stay.
-
Use of Eco friendly energies such as solar and wind power, recycling of
waste water, heat sealed pavement, water retaining pedestrian blocks,
garbage recycling  including reduction, and rainwater harvesting have been
covered.
-
Facility planning for profitable service area includes merchandising plans
explained based on case study for Connecticut, USA; Japan, and Indian
scenario.
As an added tool, Parking Management has been described along with pictorial layout of
similar facilities in Japan.

Toll Plaza Operation
CHAPTER – 1
TOLL PLAZA OPERATION
1.1
TOLL COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
Toll plazas are designed to provide a venue for vehicles to stop and pay toll for using the
facility (expressway). The specific venue planning is guided by the facilities needed to
implement toll operations or toll system. Based on traffic characteristics, revenue
requirements, maintenance considerations, site opportunities and constraints, the
methodology for toll collection comprises of the following.
1.1.1
Outline of ticketing systems
A ticket system at toll collection entails the issuance of a ticket to every vehicle entering
the expressway. This ticket shall generally be encoded with the vehicle class, entry toll
plaza, date, time, entry toll attendant identification, vehicle registration number and an
entry serial number. The ticket is surrendered by the driver at exit and is processed by the
exit toll attendant. The exit toll collection equipment encodes the ticket with exit point, and
again encodes vehicle class, date, time, attendant identification, vehicle registration number
and an exit serial number. All these informations are then electronically stored for subsequent
use in the Audit process. The ticketing system can be operated either in attended or
unattended fashion using automatic ticket issuing machine. The system requires vehicles
to make only two stops: one to pick up the ticket and one to surrender the ticket and pay
toll and thus the delay is minimized. Another advantage is that the toll charges can be
structured to have very similar “per-kilometer” rates for all movements.   Bar code reader
is desirable at the entry and exit for efficient use.
1.1.2
Types of toll collection methods
Three types of toll collection methods prevalent at present are
a)
Manual – A method of toll collection which involves classifying vehicles,
collecting cash, providing change and receipts. The operation is conducted
manually by a toll booth attendant. The details of transactions are recorded
and stored in the computer.
b)
Smart Card – This method comprises, the system for vehicle identification,
barrier and synchronize traffic light and payment through smart card. A smart

III - 2
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
Fig. 1.01 Two Piece OBU with an IC Card
Fig. 1.02 On Board Unit with Bar Code
card is a plastic card, usually about the same size as a magnetic stripe
card that has embedded electronic logic to data and in some cases a chip
that can process data. Smart card users have to stop at “Touch and Go”
reader at both entry and exit lanes while passing through the toll plaza. The
physical components of a smart card system are i) a card; ii) a reader
device; iii) a terminal; iv) a host computer and v) the connections which link
the components of the system.
c)
ETC: Electronic Toll Collection – This technology relies on two major
components: a transponder which is an On Board Unit (OBU); and a
communicator which is a road side antenna. OBU assigned to a vehicle
replaces cash as the form of toll payment. The communicator is used to
identify the transponder automatically and therefore validate the toll payment.
A non-stop (regulated speed) cashless ETC, requires a system that remotely
identifies a transponder attached to a moving vehicle. Here the
communicator (antenna) is connected to a Central Processing Unit (CPU).
Two piece type OBU with multipurpose contactless card is desirable.  The card can also
be used in Touch and Go system as well as can be used as credit card for other payments.
Fig. 1.01 presents such OBU unit.
Another type of OBU could be with bar code marking for multipurpose use as shown
in Fig. 1.02.   This is currently under considerations for use in Delhi-Gurgaon Toll
Plaza.

Toll Plaza Operation
1.1.3
Toll gate activities
As the vehicle enters the toll plaza area, the same is detected by the roadside antenna
arrangement of the toll system. Vehicle proceeds to dedicated lane for either Non-ETC
cash lane or ETC lane.
a)
Vehicle Identification
Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system placed adjacent to toll lane
identifies the vehicle for classification and pictures the vehicle registration
number. A video image of the vehicle is also taken for record. All these are
sent to a Central Processing Unit (CPU) at Traffic Management Center
(TMC) for record, processing and subsequent usage.
b)
Entry to Expressway (Ticket Issue)
•
Cash Payment Users
At the toll booth, the user receives the ticket from the attendant or the
machine kept for the purpose. Once the ticket is issued, the barrier goes
up and the vehicle can proceed.
•
Smart Card (Touch & Go)
The user touches the receiver and the vehicle details alongwith point of
entry are recoded and sent to CPU.
•
ETC Users (Smart Card)
On dedicated ETC lane, the communicator/antenna (placed roadside
or on overhead gantry) looks for a transponder (OBU) and captures
vehicle details. The vehicle with valid transponders proceeds further.
For a vehicle with invalid transponder, the barrier boom closes the lane
and the vehicle is diverted to a non-ETC lane. The information details
collected by the roadside antenna are sent to Traffic Management Center
(TMC) for further processing and usages. In the absence of transponder
or it being or non-valid, “additional collection efforts” will be required
and ticket will be issued similar to cash payment procedure.
c)
Exit from Expressway (Pay Toll)
Digital display for showing the toll rates to various destinations using LED indicator
shall be placed at exit toll booth location. The user has to pay the toll charges and
submit the ticket received at the entry.  Fig. 1.03 shows LED display.



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 316
======================================================================
III - 4
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
•
Cash Payment
The attendant verifies the information on the entry ticket and the toll amount
payable is generated by the computer.  On payment, the attendant issues
the receipt and barrier gate opens for onward passage of the vehicle.
•
Smart Card (Touch & Go)
Once the card touches the receiver, the payable toll amount is generated
by the computer based on the entry information and the same is deducted
from the card.
•
ETC Payment (Smart Card)
On ETC lane, the toll payment/transaction is done electronically using the On
Board Unit (OBU) with smart card or a tag. The transponder, assigned to the
customer and/or the customer’s vehicle, replaces cash as the form of Toll Payment.
With Automatic Debiting Systems (ADS), the transponder (OBU) is used to
store the balance of fund remaining in the smart card. As the OBU is interrogated
by the communicator (antenna), the current balance is read, the toll due deducted
and a new balance is written. The transaction becomes a self contained record
detailing the location, time and date of journey undertaken.
1.2
OPERATIONS IN TOLL PLAZA
1.2.1
Broad operations
a)
At entry – check regularly the ticketing machine and the manual operations,
Fig. 1.03 LED Display (showing Toll Rate)



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 316
======================================================================
III - 5
Toll Plaza Operation
tickets left out (i.e. not collected by the users).  This check will be exercised
for one month or for a period as decided by the authority. A regular
reconciliation of tickets issued, tickets left out and the total vehicle movement
shall be carried out on daily basis.
b)
 At exit – supervisor checks all collected tickets and the collections, missing
ticket records, incidents involving “additional effort” for recovery of tolls and
shall reconcile with the reports of the entry supervisor and the desk
supervisors. This shall be carried out on daily basis.
1.2.2
Control of overloaded/oversize vehicles
a)
Overloaded vehicles: These are generally slow in running speed,
leads to platoon formation in absence of adequate overtaking
situation. In addition, these vehicles cause enormous damage to
pavement life. Therefore, overloaded vehicles need to be identified
before the toll plaza and guided to proceed to the static weighing
area for appropriate penal/legal actions by competent authority. The
overload components
(if possible) shall be un-loaded, prior to releasing the vehicle for onward
journey.
b)
Other Illegal Vehicles: On these expressway network, only motor vehicles
with minimum 4-wheels are allowed. Two/three wheelers, bicycles or animal
drawn vehicles are prohibited. Such vehicles shall be stopped and advised/
directed to take other routes.  Another type of illegal vehicle is oversize
vehicles. They are nuisance/hazards in traffic stream and affect free flow.
At toll plaza, a separate lane with enhanced width and vertical clearance is
provided to accommodate the same. Prior to leaving the toll plaza area
such vehicles should be trimmed, if possible, to legal/permitted size as per
Motor Vehicles Act.
1.2.2.1
Daily checking
For this purpose Weigh in Motion (WIM) system shall be installed on all traffic lanes and

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
1.2.2.2
Special checking with regulatory authority
The static vehicle weighing system with storage facilities for off loading of excess cargo
and areas for administrative personnel shall be placed in the toll plaza area. This facility
shall be provided one each to cater for each direction of travel.
1.2.3
Traffic congestion measures
The toll lanes are provided to meet the peak demand and the facility also shall provide
additional standby lanes or dual purpose lanes such as lanes for oversized vehicles
to meet the eventualities due to maintenance, excessive traffic and non-functioning
of booth.
1.2.3.1
Flexible gate opening
During the entire day, the traffic volumes are of “peak and off peak” nature. Therefore,
during off peak period, the number of functioning toll lanes may be reduced in a
systematic manner with sufficient measures for traffic guidance (flexible barriers) and
Fig. 1.04 Piezo Electric Sensors and Inductive Loops
the information shall be recorded.  This system comprises Piezo electric sensors and
inductive loops as shown in Fig. 1.04.

signages. This toll-lane-turn-off period shall be gainfully utilized for servicing,
maintenance of booth equipment and cleaning plaza lane.
1.2.3.2
Capacity enhancement
With increase in traffic volume, the demand for number of toll-lane increases. Generally,
the toll lanes are constructed to meet the demand for 20 years projected/forecast traffic
with provisions kept for phased development. Capacity can be enhanced by increasing
number of toll lanes or adopting higher technology i.e. converting Non-ETC lanes to ETC
lanes. Adoption of upgraded technology will save space as well as administrative tasks.
Cash lanes shall be designed for upgrading to ETC lanes depending on projected ETC
usage and traffic.
1.2.4
Organization and responsibilities
Routine inspection on 24 hr x 7 day basis shall be carried out.  Operation staff,
security personnel and officers shall match this requirement alongwith adequate
numbers of relieving persons. The organization chart for toll operation is indicated
in Fig. 1.05:

The ETC lane at the plaza shall have a distinct identification signage adequately illuminated
and placed over the dedicated lane. Fig. 1.10B presents Guide Sign on Toll Lane Portal.
The portal over the ETC lane shall also have purpose oriented informative features. For easy
identification by user, the pavement surface of the ETC lane shall be marked with special type,
such as, white chevron marking on blue background and the word ETC is written on the
pavement surface.  Fig. 1.10C presents ETC Lane Marking on the pavement surface.
Provisions on Segregated ETC Lane
On ETC lane, the communicator (antenna) has to identify the transponder (OBU) for
validation. An invalid transponder or a vehicle without transponder need to be diverted to
a Non-ETC lane. This would require an additional length of around 30 m between the
location of communicator and the lane barrier for diverting the errant vehicle. To effect this
diversion, removable barriers are placed between the ETC and Non-ETC lane.

For Toll Area Safety
a)
Provisions for Toll Booth Utility
The toll booth utility service, connecting the office area to the various toll
booths are provided for movement of cash, personnel and providing utility
service lines. This provision may be as overpass or underpass depending
on site specific conditions and economic considerations. However, the
followings may be kept in view.
Overpass is preferable compared to underpass (tunnel) due to the followings:
•
Dirt and water is likely to gather at underpasses.
•
Computer and optical facilities are prone to malfunction in presence of dirt
and water/moisture.
•
Un-expected heavy rain may flood the underpass.
•
Even if we provide pump - power failure may happen.
•
Using glass window will reduce the number of offensive attack because
other users can see (watch) the overpass.

AUDIT
1.6.1
General procedure
The toll plaza shall have toll audit system and fraud protection measures. The operations
for toll collection, supervision, auditing and money handling shall be done through the
qualified trained personnel so that each operation is handled efficiently and appropriately.
The toll audit unit would be responsible for the audit of all toll attendants.  Toll attendants
must be audited for every hour of duty in order to identify precisely the period of wrong use
or misuse.  This unit will audit a “seven-day-work” for toll collection within the next five
days. It is extremely important that this unit shall not be understaffed.  It is anticipated that
all information received from the toll plazas would be stored on a central computer for
processing. These would contain information entered by toll attendants and independent
information recorded by treadles and loops regarding axle counts and transactions. This
applies to entry lanes as well as exit lanes. Amounts to be deposited by attendants would
be calculated by the equipment at the toll plaza from the information contained on toll
tickets processed through the exit lane terminal.  The entry-lane audit is as important as
the exit lane audit even though no cash is involved.
1.6.2
Monitoring toll collector’s data and counter measures
Transaction/money and axle counts (vehicle) should be reconciled to the tickets issued to
ascertain any misuse/wrong use by the entry attendant. The system must also provide for
non-revenue vehicles which are allowed to travel without paying a toll.  In these cases,
axles and transactions would be counted but toll amount in terms of money would not be
entered. These transactions must be handled by a special pass which is processed through
the attendant’s terminal and identifies the user. The use of non-revenue passes should be
reviewed by supervisor periodically, preferably on a monthly basis and / or random basis
for any suspicious use.
Effective and credible means of enforcement are essential to the success of any
ETC system.  Barriers to deny access to customers without a valid form of payment
are one alternative for installation on a toll plaza. Transactions at high speeds (greater
than 60 kmph) are complex where a barrier requires raising to allow passage.  Barrier
system such as “to keep a barrier in the raised position until a vehicle attempts to
violate the system (gain passage without payment)” is not recommended for
expressways in terms of safety.



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 316
======================================================================
III - 19
Toll Plaza Operation
An increasingly effective method of enforcement being adopted universally is to employ a
Vehicle Enforcement System (VES). This captures an image of any violating vehicle’s
number plate by means of camera or video technology. A summons/challan for non-payment
can then be issued to the registered vehicle’s address.
1.7
USER SERVICE AT EXIT BOOTH
1.7.1
Driver’s enquiry
The driver’s operating on the route may be a new person traveling for the first time may
enquire about the toll rate and subsequent route guidance. This shall be provided by the
toll attendant or shall be advised for the appropriate place where the driver can get his
desired information.
1.7.2
Traffic information on incident
The toll attendant must inform the driver of any incident occurred on connecting highways
and shall be advised for necessary precautions. The probable delay which the driver may
suffer due to the incident shall also be conveyed to him so that the driver can decide to
continue his journey or spend some time in the nearest rest area for clearance of the incident.
1.7.3
Advertisement
The advertisement brochures of informative nature may be handed over to the driver for
possible information on traffic safety enhancement, important places, tourist information
and availability of regional foods, handicrafts and special medical assistance.
1.7.4
Trouble shooting
1.7.4.1
Machine trouble
Machine troubles may be of three types i.e. on Hardware, Software and Breakdown
•
Hardware Troubles
Abnormalities in functioning of machine/equipments like video system not
working, loop not functioning, exit boom not working, computers not able to
access network, keyboard/mouse is not working etc. On noticing such
incidents during normal operations, the toll booth operator or lane supervisor
shall report to the systems in-charge over internal telephone/communication
system and also through a fault report.



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 316
======================================================================
III - 20
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
•
Software Troubles
Some troubles which are noticed by the toll operator or lane supervisor
such as hanging of work stations, virus attacks, application software not
responding etc. shall be reported to systems in-charge over internal
telephone/communication system and also through a fault report.
•
Breakdown of the System
This may be noticed by the toll booth operator or lane supervisor during
normal operation or from extraneous reason (vandalism/accidents), the
supervisor shall immediately report over internal communication system as
well as through a fault report. Vocal communication system may be used for
help and need of the lane supervisor and security personnel.
For all such events, the affected lane shall be closed and the traffic shall be diverted to
other operating lanes.
1.7.4.2
Lost ticket
At exit, the toll collection process will involve “additional collection effort”, provided
the vehicle registration number details captured at entry lane can be traced from
Traffic Management Center (TMC). If the entry details are non traceable for the
vehicle, the user identification card and vehicle images along with vehicle
registration number shall be noted and mutually agreed penal amount may be
collected based on driver’s statement.
Quoted below is a relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in Japan.
Q.
What if I lose my transit ticket?
A.
If you lose your transit ticket, please inform the attendant at the exit toll booth
and fill out the necessary paperwork. Customers will be asked about the
situation and toll will be charged from the entrance interchange only if that
interchange can be confirmed. Otherwise, toll will be charged from the farthest
interchange, so please take care to not lose your transit ticket.

Toll Plaza Operation
Toll collector, the monitoring attendant and lane supervisor must declare the incident in
document for each shift. The supervisor must check the detail using recorded data (Vehicle
Classification Data – from video recording).
1.7.4.3
ETC error
It may be the failure of transaction due to non-reading/non-communication between the
transponder (OBU) and the communicator (Antenna). In such cases, the usable video
imaging for vehicle and vehicle registration number details becomes the only source. The
“additional collection effort” involving entry identification may become prohibitive. Mutually
acceptable amount may be a solution (Using similar procedure as for lost ticket).
a)
Vehicle Classification Error
Particular type of vehicles may have been detected as class A instead of
class B. In that case, toll office manager has to examine the data and may
inform the supervisor to check the equipment along with other measures.
b)
Power Failure and Thunderbolt
Power failure and thunderbolt may cause huge damage to information stored.
Retrieval of data to the extent possible shall be made with the help of a
back-up power generator. However, in between the switchover process,
some communicated data may be lost.
c)
Human Failure
When lane supervisor or user wrongly operates ETC machine, transaction
error may happen.
When the error is noticed, the lane supervisor shall guide the user to the toll
office or to a non-operating lane and settle the issue. The supervisor and
toll office manager shall check to avoid similar ETC error again.
1.8
TOLL EVASION COUNTER MEASURES
Enforcement by means of manual policing can be an option to be considered. This is
generally relied upon as a backup to another means of enforcement. Some heavy
vehicle drivers may attempt to gain passage through dedicated “cars only” lanes, but
using an OBU encoded with a car classification. This practice is regarded as toll
evasion - the offender may be treated in the same way as someone who made
attempt – not to pay.



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 316
======================================================================
III - 22
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
Another aid in enforcement is Automatic Vehicle Classification (AVC). These systems
can work with all the classification methods previously described. Axle counting systems
are the most well established of this genre, utilising axle sensors mounted on the road
surface. Inductive loops buried underneath the road are often used for length based AVC,
although increasing use is being made of image processing based systems. The latter
can even work via an interface with existing CCTV equipment. The most complicated
AVC equipment is that required to determine vehicle type, but this is generally based on
high resolution imaging technology.
1.8.1
Ticket exchange
This is a typical situation and likely venue would be the Rest Areas. A policing mechanism
may need to be adopted.
Attendant placed at the entry gate and will take the Toll Ticket in his custody and will return
the toll ticket at the exit gate. At entry, a video image of the vehicle and vehicle registration
number will be attached with the toll ticket for return and verification at EXIT.
1.8.2
Pass through toll gate without paying
1.8.2.1
Tailgating
The most common form of evasion is that of tailgating. Here a vehicle which is not equipped
with a transponder drives nose-to-tail behind a vehicle equipped for valid ETC payment.
This form of toll evasion is usually carried out with the two drivers working together, as it
requires a fair amount of skill to avoid being distinguished as two separate vehicles without
colliding. Tailgating is only practical where passage is at low speeds, e.g. when barriers
are employed. The use of an effective AVC system coupled with a visible deterrent in the
form of VES should prevent such activity.

The above system collects, collates and analyzes data collected from the data sources
and transmitting equipment exchanges information with various terminals located at
interchanges, tunnels and important structures.  In order to increase the efficiency in
processing and analyzing the huge data base it would be necessary to have dedicated
software development with inbuilt provisions to disseminate guide information in
emergency situation.  Engineers and operators, on the site, shall have a mobile terminal
for direct connection to the facilities center.  This provides support to the engineers to
carry out the maintenance and inspection of road facilities.

Disaster prevention center
The center is primarily engaged in Disaster planning, prevention, preparedness,
response, and recovery. All these fall into the category of emergency management.
Emergency is defined as any unplanned event that can cause deaths or significant
injuries to employees, customers or the public; or that can shut down businesses,
disrupt operations, cause potential environmental damage, or threaten a facility’s
financial standing. Emergency management is the process of preparing for, mitigating,
responding to, and recovering from an emergency.  Fig. 2.04 presents typical disaster
prevention center in Japan.

Typical disasters occur/happen due to:
Heavy Rainfall: This may cause the erosion of embankment slopes, damage to the
drainage structures (including bridges) and landslides (in hilly terrain).
Cyclone: A cyclone is a tropical weather system with winds that have reached a sustained
speed of 120 kmph or more. The combination of growing population and development in
coastal zones, rising ocean levels, coastal erosion, and changing climatic trends have
increased the potential for loss of life and property in coastal regions of the country.
Floods: Most states in India experience some kind of flooding after rains, heavy
thunderstorms. Floods can be slow, or fast rising, but generally develop over a

period of days; the exceptions being “flash floods” (which result from intense storms
dropping large amounts of rain within a brief period, and can occur with little or no
warning), and dam/barrage failures (which can suddenly let loose a gigantic quantity
of water).
Earthquakes: An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by the tectonic
movement of earth crust. This shaking can cause buildings and bridges / elevated
Expressways to collapse, and sometimes trigger landslides and avalanches, all impacting
the transportation network.
Wild land Fires: As residential areas expand into relatively untouched wild lands,
people living in these communities are increasingly threatened by forest fires.
Unpredictable wildfires can wipe out huge sections of landscape and endanger the
lives of residents, necessitating evacuations from the threatened locations.
Additionally, the smoke from these fires can significantly reduce visibility over a
wide area, resulting in reduced speed limits, Expressway closures, and traffic
diversions.
Homeland Security: The terrorist attacks have become frequently occurring unfortunate
events exact a terrible toll on the country and fundamentally affects the way of life. Surface
transportation is also changed, and continues to change in response to the attack.
2.1.3
Information dissemination
Information generated at the Control Center shall be disseminated in the following manner:
To the users: By displays on the Graphic information Boards on Streets, Variable
Message Signs on expressway and on Streets (Expressway Closed), Travel Time
Information Boards, Latest Congestion Warning Boards, Tunnel Warning Display Boards,
Emergency Broadcast in Tunnels, Wind Speed Display Boards, Variable Regulatory Speed
Signs, Vehicle Information and Communication System, Telephone Services, via internet
web pages.
To the Operation and maintenance teams: By mobile phones.

To the law and order administrators: By mobile phones
The effective dissemination of user information services supports many types of
information requests and categories of users, and combines multi-modal information in
an effective and timely manner. Information may be provided in a number of ways,
including static information and real-time information. Static information comes from
such sources as transit schedules, planned work zones, and known road closures. Real-
time information comes from a variety of sources including roadway-based sensors,
surveillance equipment, and drivers. The information assists users in selecting their
mode of travel, route, and departure times – both pre-trip and enroute. Fig. 2.05
illustrates the possibilities of range of data sources, processing and uses of user
information. The figure depicts the various sources of data (left-hand side, and including
expressway conditions) which are collected and centrally processed (central part of
figure) to yield integrated information about the current and future travel conditions; and
which are broadcast or disseminated to users, allowing them to make informed choices
about when, where and how to travel.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
As shown in the Fig. 2.05 – the information process extends well beyond the
expressway, both in terms of where the information is obtained and how it is distributed.
Information on expressway conditions and the dissemination of that information to
users should therefore be viewed as part of a broader, region-wide, Advanced Traffic
Information System (ATIS).
2.1.3.1
Variable message signs
Variable Message Signs (VMS) are quite useful in conveying the traffic conditions ahead
to the drivers on real time basis as well as to display messages to support national road
safety campaigns. It may also include the variable traffic speed limit depending upon the
requirements.
Variable Message Signs are capable of displaying several messages in a sequence and
can be repeated. Such messages can be changed manually, by remote control or by
automatic control. Variable Message Signs shall display pertinent traffic operation and
guidance information only and not any advertising. Various situations where VMS would
be appropriate are as below:
i)
Incident signs as accidents, traffic diversions, incident management, monitor
road work (men at work), adverse weather and road conditions and
operation with lane control signals;
ii)
Traveler information such as display of road construction activity in near
future, messages for testing of the system and special events that affect the
traffic flow;
iii)
Public service announcements like messages relating to driver safety
campaign.
a)
Locations of VMS
Variable message signs are used to visually provide expressway users with information
about traffic, required time, parking condition, road, weather conditions, etc. in order to
ensure that the traffic moves safely and smoothly.  These boards are categorized as shown
below according to their use remarkably, and congestion occurs frequently, and the images
are monitored at a traffic control center or operation office.

A location of events differs according to their importance and requirements.
In case of traffic accidents, the location of events is a point on expressway, which may be
on a stretch of expressway or as a region.  As for example, congestion is on a stretch
whereas the meteorological information is applicable for the region.
When a large scale accident blocking the expressway happens, it is required to inform
oncoming vehicles to exit at the next interchange.  When the number of lane is reduced
due to road work, it is necessary to instruct the vehicles to slow down.  The different
instruction messages, according to the extent and seriousness of the event, shall be placed.
For appropriate actions by the drivers like slowing down or changing road shall be indicated
before a few interchanges enabling them to change the travel route or even commencing
journey on the expressway.  Similarly for lane changing due to road works, the VMS may
be placed at or near the incident.
Information on traffic condition should be renewed on real time basis may be at a cycle of
one to five minutes, information on weather – which does not change so quickly, can be



======================================================================

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
renewed at the cycle of ten minutes or so, and information on warning of scheduled work
can be renewed on half day basis.
2.1.3.2
Portable VMS – on vehicles
The variable message signs can be fixed or portable. Portable signs can be mounted at
the back of the truck or similar vehicle. The portable VMS signs mounted on a truck could
be powered by solar energy or battery and show the sign of ‘men at work’ and/or speed
limits in the construction zone. Proper placement of a portable VMS is critical to its
effectiveness. The placement must give adequate time to the motorists to react to the
message and take corrective action. On Expressways and National Highways placement
of these at 2 km prior to the decision points should be done with repetition at 1 km and
500 m. It should provide adequate sight distance (around 300 m) and should not interfere
with other traffic control devices. If the portable VMS set up along the roadway and a
message was not to be required for a period of next four hours or more, the sign panel
should be turned away. Fig. 2.08 presents the typical portable VMS.
2.1.3.3`
Highway advisory radio
Although not as widely used as VMS, Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) is another means of
providing highway users with information in their vehicles. Traditionally, information is
relayed to highway users through the AM radio receiver in their vehicles. Upstream of the
HAR signal, users are instructed to tune their vehicle radios to a specific frequency via
roadside or overhead signs. Usually, the information is relayed to the users by a
prerecorded message, although live messages can also be broadcast.

======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 316
======================================================================
III - 45
Traffic Management
Highway advisory radio (HAR) is an effective tool for providing timely traffic and travel
condition information to the public. It has various advantages and disadvantages. It is
most important advantage is that it can reach more users, or potential users, than Variable
Message Signs (VMS). While VMS reach only those motorists at a particular point, and
can only convey a short message, HAR has the advantage of being able to communicate
with any persons in their broadcast range. Further, the amount of information that can be
conveyed is much greater. Its primary disadvantages are that it is restricted to low power,
and this leads quite often to poor signal quality (since it is affected by many outside forces
such as weather), and it requires the driver to take an action (i.e., turn on the radio or
change the station or both). This can lead to poor listening.
Messages are broadcast in the field from transmitters that play stored messages. These
messages are transmitted to the field from a “central” location, which can be a traffic
control center or any telephone. In its simplest form, no central system is needed, only
an analog phone line to the transmitter so that an operator can record a message in the
transmitter for broadcast. This is labour intensive if an agency maintains a number of
transmitters, and traffic conditions change throughout the day. Its advantage is that it is
inexpensive, and message can be sent to a transmitter from anywhere a phone exists,
even from a cell phone. Alternatively, a central message distribution system is used to
record new messages, store pre-recorded messages, and distribute messages to the
transmitters (simultaneous if necessary). This is typically a PC-based system with
security access control.
Deployment strategies
HAR can be broadcast in two ways: Point or Wide-Area coverage.
•
In Point broadcast, a single transmitter is used to broadcast over a given
area. This is typically used at diversion points of areas of recurring congestion
to notify motorists of queues and congestion. This type of implementation
is popular with users because the information is specific to them.
•
Wide Area Broadcast transmits a signal to a larger coverage area
using multiple synchronized transmitters. This is an effective strategy
when a single message is applicable to a large coverage area, and
the coverage area is sufficiently large for a motorist to hear the longer
message length. The fact that a long single message, that is pertinent

Internet or mobile services
On-Line services to access the Internet represent an additional means to disseminate
pre-trip user information. The Internet’s effectiveness as a fast and flexible communication
medium has spurred explosive growth in all sectors of society. The network is now in daily
use by people in all professions.
to specific users for only a part of the message is indeed a
disadvantage.
Portable and Mobile Systems
Portable systems permanently installed on trailers and mobile systems installed on service or
maintenance vehicles can be of value in providing timely dissemination of information to
motorists during short-term deviations from normal highway conditions. This is particularly
true in areas where there is limited or no normal coverage or the permanent transmitter site
has failed. These systems can be solar powered, generator powered, or battery powered
(Fig. 2.09). Portable/mobile systems can be set up at decision points where a route guidance
system directs motorist to an alternate route. This will increase motorist comfort level by
reinforcing their confidence that they are following the alternate route instructions correctly.

Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS)
VICS is a digital data communication system which promptly provides the latest road
traffic information to drivers via the car navigation system. The world’s first VICS service
started in Japan in 1996. VICS, using 5.8 GHz DSRC, can transmit various and large-
volume information quickly. Drivers are promptly communicated on network situation and
spot information from roadside camera. Drivers are also warned/advised on voice
communication.
There are generally three different on-board equipments used in Japan, which supply
different depth of information.

The next step on receipt of information is to identify the precise location and nature of accident,
as well as the display, recording, and communication of this information to the appropriate
agencies. Operations center personnel may verify accidents and communicate with incident
responders on scene, or provide details to emergency agency dispatchers. These should include:
•
Field units (e.g. police) at the incident site
•
Closed circuit TV images
•
Communication with helicopters operated by police, media or information
service providers
•
Combining or fusing information from multiple cellular calls
2.2.1.2
Information provisions
Reporting information of the accident/incident to all drivers enroute for at least 50 km prior
to the incident location.
Motorist information is the activation of a variety of communications media to relay traffic.
Dissemination of information is one of the primary services provided by TMCs, and the
Techniques may include:

Ambulances may be parked in the work zone, if necessary.  A senior representative as a
member of the Management Team shall ensure that a proper record is kept of the activities
on scene, and of decisions made.
The first team on the scene of the incident, shall note the details, prioritize patients, aid the
injured  and place advance warning signs to users.
Where possible, assist the concerned law and order authorities with regard to the following:
i)
Ensure that the necessary blood samples are collected by a suitable qualified
person where substance misuse is suspected.
ii)
Inform concerned authorities, investigation team when the particulars of
patients can be collected prior to departing from incident scene.
iii)
Assist concerned authorities to complete outstanding patient details after
the incident has been cleared, if the particulars of a patient could not be
obtained on scene.

Inclement weather (not conducive to comfortable driving)
2.2.2.1
Information collection
The effects of weather on expressways differ in areas according to geography, topography
(level terrain, mountainous region), and road structure (cut, embankment, bridge). To
accurately understand the road weather, which can change within a short distance on the
roads, to perform road maintenance, to secure safe and smooth flow traffic by informing
road users of the weather conditions, to promote efficient use of the roads etc. all require
the installation of various meteorological observation equipment on the expressways.

Meteorological Information Facilities
i)
Overview
Meteorological information facilities are weather observation instruments
installed along roadsides to gather data needed for road management
and the execution of snow and ice measures.
ii) Meteorological Observation Facility System Chart
Meteorological items observed are the air temperature, road
temperature, rainfall, snowfall, wind direction and wind speed.
Data concerning mist, road surface icing etc. are also gathered
according to regional meteorological conditions and road management
conditions.

Thermometers
Thermometers are used to continually measure the exterior air
temperature based on the resistance fluctuations caused by the
temperature of the platinum temperature resistant body.
ii) Rainfall/Snow Gauge
A rainfall/snow gauge collects rain or snow and automatically weighs it
according to the tilt of its tipping bucket to measure the precipitation.

Traffic Management
iv) Visual Obstruction Sensors
Visual obstruction sensors include transmissometers (VI meters) and
Backward Scattering visibility meters (BS meters).
VI meter, which consists of a floodlight and light receiver installed facing
each other to measure light transmissivity, is appropriate where the main
objective is the measurement of mist.
BS meter, a device consisting of an integrated floodlight and light
receiver aimed in the same direction, measures the light scattered
backwards from mist or falling snow (reflected light). It is appropriate for
use where the principal phenomenon observed is the obstruction of
visibility by falling snow.
v) Meteorological CCTV
CCTV system is an appropriate way to provide images confirming that
actual conditions on a road conform to values provided by monitoring
instruments. It is also a good method to clarify road conditions that are
difficult to measure using meteorological observation instruments. (e.g.
blowing snow or amount of snow accumulated on the road surface).
vi) Anemoscope/Anemometer
Anemoscope/anemometers that are used to measure the wind speed
and its direction are aero vane pane type consisting of a propeller that
measures the wind speed and a tail plane.
iii) Precipitation Sensors
A precipitation sensor immediately senses the beginning and end of
rainfall or snowfall. In this way, it obtains up to the minute information
about the beginning of rainfall, a period when road conditions are
particularly slippery.
A precipitation sensor can also automatically distinguish between snow,
rain, and mist if it is combined with a VI meter or BS meter.

vii) Seismograph
A seismograph detects the earthquake movement acceleration of two
components of horizontal and vertical motion, its processor records the
time of the earthquake and its acceleration wave profile and calculates
the SI value, measured intensity, maximum acceleration etc.
viii) Road Surface Thermometer and Soil Thermometer
A road surface thermometer and a soil thermometer perform
measurements with two thermometers (fluctuation in resistance caused
by the temperature of a platinum temperature resistant body) installed
at different depth under the ground surface to predict the icing of the
surface of a through highway.
2.2.2.2
Information provisions
Analysis of the Meteorological data recorded on site alongwith the weather forecast made
by National Meteorological Department, the expressway section specific data, which may
affect on expressway, shall be generated and conveyed to drivers for possible precautions
to be exercised by them.
Likely heavy rainfall, formation of fog and snow (rare) impedes the vehicle speed, visibility
and may develop hydroplaning effect. All these effects need to be conveyed to the drivers
through Variable Message Signs, highway radio broadcasting and in vehicle unit (if any).
2.2.2.3
On site action
a)
Expressway road section, being at a higher level, the precipitates are drained
out by the cross slopes and in sag profile areas adequate drainage facilities
are to be provided. The road side drains including chutes shall be kept
clean for easy passage of rain water.
b)
To prevent hydroplaning effect, the macro structure of the road surface at
the probable locations may be enhanced for draining out the water from the
contact area between the tyre and pavement.  Alternatively, a porous asphalt
wearing course may be used.
c)
In snowfall areas measures to deal with snow accumulation and icing on
expressway include mechanical snow removal and spreading de-icing
chemicals on roads. Appropriate storage of materials and the equipment
alongwith operators shall be present in nearby operating yard/service areas.

CHAPTER – 3
SERVICE AREA MANAGEMENT
3.1
ADMINISTRATION FOR SERVICE AREA
Service Areas shall be an integral part of an expressway system. The administration for
operation and maintenance forms the basic requirement to be a successful service area,
satisfying user needs in a best possible way. Security, safety and maintenance are the
primary requirement for a service area. From the concepts of wayside amenities providing
just the need for the basic minimum services, the present day service areas are providing
retail merchandising facility. Therefore, the administration for providing such services will
require business management approach.
3.1.1
Organisation
The expressway national network are being planned to be implemented as toll roads
through Public Private Participation (PPP) process. The concessionaire (single entity or
a joint venture) may be a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the implementation.  The
Service Area is intended to be a profit making business to supplement the toll revenues.
The process may be considered in toll elasticity analysis and the related demand modelling
for future traffic.
3.1.2
Expressway authority and business tenants : risk sharing
In this context the organizational structure of Japan and in India are presented below:
a)
Scenario in Japan
In Japan, the expressways alongwith the wayside amenities were constructed using
Government (National) funding, as tollway. Subsequently for operation and maintenance,
three private organizations to deal with East, Central and West parts of the expressway
were formed. The mandate was for i) Operation and Maintenance of expressway and ii)
to payback the Government the investment costs. This leasing system was considered
for 45 years as a payback period. The toll rates were fixed by the Government and the
entrusted recently formed private organizations were responsible for toll collection as well
as associated operation and maintenance. The Government/Agency imposed that private
contractor cannot make any profit on toll revenues and the Government would reimburse
all the costs incurred by the private organization.  This was the basic concept.



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 316
======================================================================
III - 60
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-III: OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
Later on, these private organizations, with an aim to earn additional revenue, started
creating additional high quality customer facilities by extending around the already built
service areas, and originally handed over to the private companies. These extensions of
facilities are funded by the private companies from their own resources including
construction, operation and maintenance.
Since the private organizations are not permitted to make any profit on the toll revenue,
these newly added facilities become the prime revenue (profit) source for the private
organisations. The organisation structure and the Agency/Company involvements are
schematically shown in Fig. 3.01 and Fig. 3.02 presents the distribution of additional
facilities created and the original areas based to the private companies.
b)
Scenario in India
In India, the expressway business is yet to pick-up in an organized way and it would require
comprehensive planning and developing financing mechanisms and integrating with the
regional development.  This may provide means for additional resources and generate
business acumen of the prospective concessionaires.
For the implementation of National Expressway Network under PPP, the organizational
developments need to be defined in the concession agreement. The concessionaire

Service Area Management
agreement also shall define the basic requirements of the users and the operation and
maintenance norms to be followed by the concessionaire. These norms shall form the
basic tools for inspection and monitoring by the Client/Agency/Authority.
The prime issues which need to be addressed for developing service area cum business
centers along the expressways are as follows:
•
Additional Right-of-Way (ROW)/Area need to be acquired.
•
Development right flanking the expressway and on the periphery of the
business development area need to be defined.
•
The ownership of the area developed for business along the expressway
need to be defined beyond the concession period of the expressway.
•
The minimum facility provisions/requirement for the users as well as national
benefit shall be established.
3.2
CUSTOMER SERVICES
For enhanced attraction of expressway users to the service area, a high quality customer
service shall be provided. New England Transportation Consortium (NETC), USA
(www.docs.trb.org) – research concluded that service area users value picnic areas, pet

areas, and barbecue grills the least.  However, since these services are inexpensive to
provide, they could be kept on being offered.   A grassy open space may also be important
to users/drivers, even if only some people use it and therefore the overall demand is not
high.  Still, many more may appreciate the aesthetics of a well maintained grill space.
Truck driver rated public telephone as the most essential features of rest areas.   However,
fast improvements in mobile phone technology and fall in prices for use of mobile phones
will probably mean that most users will soon have their own phones and that areas along
the new expressways will be covered by the mobile telephone network. All these need to
be considered for selecting the items for business development.  Currently, there is a
wave of commercialization of rest areas sweeping nationwide.   It is now possible to find
sites that sell tourist related merchandise, hot coffee/tea, cakes/pastries, sandwiches
and items of daily use.  Vending machines are also becoming common and they dispense
cold/hot drinks, ice creams, stationeries, mobile recharging cards, etc.  There are even
internet kiosks that operate on free services basis and also provide video-games machines
at places. Fuel and restaurants services are essential; therefore, service plazas shall
consist of gas stations, convenience stores and fast-food franchises.
Some services may be essential for the safety of the people, while other services provide
convenience – based assistance to the commuters. Information and tourism are also fast
growing segments of the overall economy, and are starting to be the major organisation to
use the service areas.
The monotony of driving makes it necessary to stop, relax and rest. The confines of the
vehicles also make it necessary for the drivers/users to get out and stretch or walk or stop
for sleep, water, and rest room breaks.  And well planned customer’s services are likely to
develop enhanced customers leading to more business.  Fig. 3.03A and Fig. 3.03B
present the customer services provided in Japan.
3.2.1
Traffic information
The information centre is equipped to provide information on enroute traffic conditions,
likely time taken to reach their destination, occurrences of some incidents such as accidents,
on going road repair and maintenances, occurrences of avalanches such as land slide,
heavy rainfall, formation of fog, mist and snow fall etc. All these provide the customer to take
necessary decisions to continue enroute or change their route or stay longer period in Service
Area for safe journey.  Fig. 3.04 shows Typical Traffic Information Center.

Recycling of waste water
Water is a precious commodity and is required in practically all walks of life. The water used
in kitchen, bathrooms, wash basins, floor washing and washing machines shall be collected
separately and carried to a treatment plant for purifying these waste waters to a usable one.
The treated water may be recycled to bathrooms, washing of clothes, utensils and watering
garden, lawns and for irrigation purpose. Typical recycling process is given in Fig. 3.08.

Garbage recycle and reduction
As key components of cleanliness and public health, the use of waste and recycling
receptacles should be encouraged. Design and location are important in reinforcing
public attitude towards proper disposal of garbage/trash. These receptacles should
be conveniently located near parking, eating areas, gardens and shall be readily visible
to users. Their appearance should be attractive and unobtrusive, blending with site
aesthetics. Key locations include entrances to main building, at picnic shelters, and
near vending machines and snack junctions.  Fig. 3.10 shows typical garbage recycle
and reduction.
The receptacles should be earmarked for glass; plastic and thermodes; metal and papers.
The idea is to separate the materials for recycling. The biodegradable wastes such as
papers, pruning outputs, leaves and dry flowers etc. can be used for recycling as “compost”
for use as bio fertilizers.
3.3.5
Rainwater harvesting
Provisions for rainwater harvesting has been made mandatory. The process of collecting
the precipitates from roof tops and the water flowing down due to natural topography
shall be collected and guided to a well specially design for storage and recharging the

3.4.1
Merchandising planning
Selection of eatable items of reputation, local specialties, specialized usable items. Many
partnerships and innovative uses have developed out of sheer necessity of market
economics. The economic forces include the large market provided by a controlled access
expressway and the physical realities of maintaining and operating rest areas. Some of
the bigger forces in this game may be chambers of commerce, regional economic
development groups, tourist bureaus and private enterprises.
a)
Case study for Connecticut, USA
Connecticut has a series of creative practices in order to maximize use of their rest areas.
Combined with other commercial facilities, the service areas have also facilities as
mentioned below:
McDonald’s has a contract to operate 10 sites along I-95 for a total of 20 years starting in
1985. The restaurant agrees to pay a percentage (13 percent to 18 percent) of gross
receipts with a guaranteed minimum. The restaurant also operates the facilities and
maintains the building (including cleaning restrooms). Mobil Gas has a total of 23 sites on
the Connecticut Interstates. The General Transportation Fund receives an 11-cent royalty
per gallon delivered to the stations and 5 percent of gross receipts of all other sales
(convenience store).
Overall, the Connecticut transportation agency receives in excess of ten million dollars
($10,000,000) per year from these private enterprises. The state treasury also collects their
usual sales taxes apart from the amount received from lease/rentals. Overall, DOT does not
maintain the buildings and they receive a substantial amount of money from these service
areas. Though, it has to be remembered that these facilities were grandfathered and that
with present legislation, this concept cannot be duplicated at other locations.
Connecticut also uses rest areas to base DOT personnel and tourism information centers.
For example, the Willington rest areas provide a DOT shed and maintenance office on I-
84 eastbound (EB), and a tourist information booth on the westbound (WB) side. The WB
side also has a fishery that is open year round for trout (supposedly the only one in the
state). Overall, Connecticut has many beneficial systems to deal with rest areas by
distributing costs.

b)
Case Study for Japan
In Japan, the privatized operating and maintenance companies cannot make any profit
on the revenue generated from toll collection. In order to increase company’s financial
base, they have taken up commercialization of the service areas with creation of innovative
value added facilities. Beside the leased properties developed by the Government,
additional facilities developed on the adjoining land at their own cost. Some of their
considerations are mentioned below:
i)
SA related business
In an innovative way, Japan has developed and new brand for the new commodity, eating and
drinking facilities which has been aptly named as PASAR, which stands for Parking Area,
Service Area and Relaxation.  Fig. 3.14 and Fig. 3.15 shows the views of Makuhari PASAR.

In the service area the company has leased areas for lease/rent to established eating,
drinking companies such as STARBUCKS, SWEET MARCHE, TULLY’S Coffee shops,
Natural Bread Bakery local as well as non-regional and European style eating places,
established Chinese and American food chains such as McDonald, NanKing etc. They
have introduced speciality stores for shopping curios, souvenirs, local mementos,
garments with local style as well as speciality and brand varieties. Fig. 3.16 shows
typical arrangements.

Hotel Business
At some locations hotel business has been started in collaboration with a famous
roadside hotel operator. The first hotel, E-Nexco Lodge Sano SA opened in July
2008. One can stay at this hotel without exiting the expressway at reasonable
price.  Fig. 3.18 shows an Expressway Hotel in Japan and in India.
•
Advertising Business
Advertising on expressway is not desirable from safety considerations.
Therefore, advertising business is allowed in service areas. There are
generally “Highway Impact,” western style advertising panels, Fig. 3.19.
ii)
Integrated SA with Amusement Parks
Direct connection to other facilities such as Amusement Parks makes expressways more
attractive because expressway users can visit them without exiting expressway network.
A typical Arrangement of integrated SA with Amusement Parks is shown in Fig.  3.20.
Expressway users can access directly to parks through a second parking lot.

c)
Scenario in India
The speciality stores have been introduced on a small scale in service areas. The
commercializations of service areas are at low key – possibly the expressways so far
developed are short stretches and connect town centers with ample amenities
For development of national expressway network, the service areas with more
commercialization concept can be planned and developed.
In this connection, recently developed scenario on retail merchandising could be exploited
to the maximum. Brief excerpts from a news paper are presented below:
i)
The Indian Retail Scenario
The organized retail sector has grown from 0.9 million sq.ft. in 1999 to 28 million sq.ft. in 2007.
The growth has been at an annual rate of 75 percent for the last six years and is expected to
grow at least 50 percent for the next 4-5 years. Today, retail contributes about 11 percent to GDP.
ii)
Mall Boom in India
With no malls in the country a decade ago, today there are 600 malls in India of which 120

are operational. The ‘retail boom’, 85 percent of which has so far been concentrated in
the metros is beginning to percolate down to the emerging cities and towns. The contribution
of these emerging cities to total organized retailing sales is expected to grow to
20-25 percent.

Service Area Management
With the above preamble, there would be several opportunities to commercialize the
Service Areas with judicious business considerations on National expressway network.
3.4.2
Parking management
An operation and management plan shall be developed for each service area to ensure
that critical activities are appropriately considered as part of on-going operations. To
provide effective management and to attract users, the basic requirements, which need
to be considered are as follows:
-
Provide segregation between large/utility vehicles and small and medium
vehicles. (Fig. 3.27)
-
Provide enough parking spaces in terms of numbers, space for parking as
well as movement.
-
Provide information on parking area availability (status) on the expressway
2 to 3 km ahead of the service area. (Fig. 3.28)
-
Adequate traffic control and safety measures shall be arranged through
appropriate planning consideration on layout and guide signs in the service
area.  (Fig. 3.29)

3.4.3
Safety and maintenance of service areas
It is important to develop a system to maintain current infrastructure and to keep it running
at a level which the travelers value. That standard may vary between different types of
service rest areas. For example, travelers expect tourist information, hotel reservation
systems, etc.
Locating police, service area authorities, maintenance facilities, etc., in connection with
service areas make travelers perceive them as safer. To keep track of users’ perception
of safety is important.
It is imperative that travelers are allowed to sleep or to take a nap at service areas. Fatigue-
related crashes cost our society huge amounts in pain and suffering since these crashes
are more serious than any other crash causation. Today, especially truck drivers have
difficulty finding areas where they legally can sleep. Currently there are time limits - and
prohibition of truck entry through developed urban areas/metropolitan cities. There should
be areas within the parking lot where drivers are not woken up when stopped. Alternatively,
rest rooms for taking a nap, sleeping, washing and bathing facilities shall be available.
Design is also an important part of the service rest area concept. This includes concerns
regarding drinking water and sewage systems. But transportation issues are obviously
also central to a good design. Vehicle speeds should be maintained low in areas were
there is pedestrian activity even if there is no enforcement. Parking spaces should be
clearly marked. That typically requires yearly rest ripping. A good pavement quality is an
issue which typically is not directly related to traffic safety—rather inversely related when

Service Area Management
it comes to travel lanes – but keeping a good pavement standard contributes to the feeling
that the rest area is well looked after and therefore safe. Also, uneven pavements can lead
to pedestrians tripping and falling down.
To keep a facility operating efficiently, it is important to keep track of its use.  A maintenance
program should include the collection of utility use, parking occupancy, visitor counts, traffic
counts and overall customer satisfaction and comments. This is probably the most important
part of an Accountability Process.
Maintenance Concerns
The in-depth interviews carried out by FHWA with travelers show that people value cleaner
restrooms more than anything else. And maybe societal economic savings could be found
in that area at the same time as the quality of cleanliness is improved. In service area,
people with disabilities who may otherwise have limited employment opportunities provide
day-to-day maintenance of rest areas through Local Community Rehabilitation Programs.
Such a policy could be brought to India as well.
Suggested Priorities
It is important to make travelers feel comfortable with the service areas where they travel.
Foremost, it is a safety and security issue. A sleepy driver needs to feel like he can stop
and take a nap almost immediately. It is therefore imperative that some parts of service
areas are open 24 hours a day, and that restroom facilities are open the entire period. But
it is not only a safety issue, well maintained rest areas make the region look good. That is
important not least for tourism, which may be an essential economic industry in several
parts. To keep service areas safe and attractive, the priorities of maintenance should be:
-
hourly cleaning of restrooms in the daytime, every 2-4 hours at night
(preferably, there are at least three restrooms, so that both men and women
always have facilities available to them)
-
snow removal/sanding as needed to keep parking lot and paths safe
-
2-3 times per day, cleaning up of other indoor facilities and the grounds near
trash bins, picnic areas, parking lot, and around restrooms
-
regular emptying and cleaning of trash receptacles, as frequently as needed
-
daily cleaning of pet areas

weekly, thorough cleanup of entire grounds, mowing of grass, pruning of
bushes and trees
-

-
annual land marking of parking lot
-
annual survey of users to assess maintenance quality
-
as needed, building maintenance/painting to keep facility in excellent
condition
-
paving according to need, to keep facility in excellent condition.
Welcome Centers and Tourist Information Centers may have even higher maintenance
needs than regular service areas.
Whether service area maintenance is done by the concessionaire or by separate
contractors, it is obviously less important than how it is done. However, quality control and
ensuring hygienic conditions are necessity, no matter to which entity the work is entrusted.

VOLUME – IV: MAINTENANCE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The document Volume-IV: Maintenance shall be read along with the other volumes of the
Guidelines to appreciate the various considerations on design, operations and
management aspects for the expressways along with all the appurtenances. The
expressway maintenance requires a systematic approach to preserve, repair and restore
its elements to its design or accepted configurations. Its system elements include
carriageway surfaces, shoulders, road verges and slopes, drainage facilities, bridges,
tunnels, signs, markings, lightings, fixtures, toll plaza, service areas etc.
Maintenance shall also take care to offset the effect of weather, environments, growth of
vegetation, deterioration, traffic wear and damages on asset due to vandalism.
Deterioration would include effects of ageing, material failures and fatigues, design and
construction faults.
Maintenance and repair of building, stock piles and equipments are essential to preserve
the expressway asset.
This document intends to provide basic information for maintenance engineers to formulate
appropriate maintenance, inspection and reporting system, which will in turn enable better
expressway management in terms of planning, manpower and budgeting.
Document has been structured into 8 (eight) chapters as follows:
Chapter – 1

The first and second chapter deliberates on general requirement and maintenance
management, which inter-alia covers “base data collection” and relationship between
inspection & maintenance.
Chapter-3 deliberates on the essential requirements of maintenance – “Inspection”.   This
comprehensively presents the type, frequency and inspection targets.  The inspection
work also covers Inspection Program & Operation, Assessment and Inspection Reports.
Typical ranking of inspection for maintenance dealing with various item of maintenance
and its assessment for ranking (AA, A, B, C, OK, E) has been presented in tabular forms
to aid maintenance engineers in formulations of work programs.
Maintenance Works and Repair as provided in Chapter-4, deliberates on the various
items broadly in two sections (i) maintenance works, and (ii) maintenance repair.  Each
section covers brief description of the various items associated with maintenance to retain
functional and structural integrity of the expressway asset.
Chapter-5 : Maintenance Operations – has been provided with the essential considerations
for carrying out the maintenance activities such as work zone safety, environmental
protection, inspection and assessment, defect treatments along with consideration and
options.  This chapter also highlights the mechanization and equipment necessary to
provide due diligence to the maintenance operations on high volume, high speed
expressways.
Chapter-6 : New Maintenance Practices, deliberates on the current scenario as followed
in other countries for similar services.   This chapter comprehensively deals with equipment
for data collection for roadways; bridge and structures; service areas and other
appurtenances.  For functional improvement of road surfaces in wet weathers, use of
porous asphalt and micro surfacing along with improvement in drainage has been briefly
mentioned.  The other aspects considered are (i) rigid pavement milling and overlaying,
(ii) waterproofing and repair of structures, (iii) protection against corrosion and salt damage,
and (iv) special road marking for night visibility.  This chapter also indicates on formation
of – Maintenance Company for leasing of maintenance vehicles.
Preventive Maintenance as briefly mentioned in Chapter-7, includes (i) necessity for
“applying the right treatment to the right pavement at the right time”, and (ii) necessity of
preventive maintenance has been broadly linked to “inspection assessment”.
Damages occurring due to natural calamities like heavy floods, sand storms, cyclones,

earthquakes to any element or system of the expressway shall be rectified and restored.
All such activities require exhaustive deliberation.  However, this Chapter-8 presents a
cursory glance to essential aspects. This chapter broadly covers (i) pre-event
preparedness measures, (ii) policy and organization for repair, (iii) emergency measures,
(iv) classifications of works, (v) slope protections against disaster, and (vi) protection
against earthquake disaster.  A disaster restoration work flow and typical damages suffered
by the various components have been presented in pictorial form with short illustrations.

1.2
BASIC MAINTENANCE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
1.2.1
Basic objectives
The maintenance engineer/personnel shall make themselves fully aware of the Project
Site with regard to the existing features of the site (such as, location, layout, geometry,
right of way, intersecting roads, existing access points, etc), all physical assets with their
inventory and condition (for example, pavement, traffic signs, etc), weather conditions
that are expected to prevail, and also the constraints at the site (such as, limitation of right
of way, existence of adjoining  property, utilities, etc), if any.  He shall plan and prepare a
detailed programme for carrying out maintenance activities to comply with the Inspection
Reports and recommendations for respective activities.
Any project report and other information provided by the Authority (Employer) shall be
used by the Maintenance Organization only for reference purpose. The Maintenance
Organization shall also assume full responsibility for undertaking all the activities, which
are necessary, but not limited to:
•
Planning and programming;
•
Development, updating and maintenance of database;
•
Field inspections, measurements, investigations and condition assessment;
•
Material mix-design and testing;
•
Determine appropriate type of treatment;
•
Construction planning including traffic management, safety to the users and
abutting property holders, safety for workers, etc;



======================================================================

IV - 3
General
•
Measurements of work done/ materials used;
•
Keeping track of intervention levels and respond within the allowable time;
•
Actual repair and maintenance works; and
•
Reviewing its performance, especially if the contract is performance-based.
1.2.2
Policies for maintenance implementation
The maintenance engineer/personnel (responsible for maintenance activities) shall take
effective measures to overcome the physical and operational constraints, if any, and
operate and maintain the Project Highway using appropriate methods, management
techniques and technologies. General considerations shall, without being limited to, be
as follows:
a)
Traffic Control and Safety
Safe and effective traffic control is vital to the safety of the traveling public. It is also essential
to protect maintenance and utility workers whose work places them near high speed traffic
and other unsafe conditions. The Concessionaire shall prepare and implement appropriate
traffic control plan and also make sure that its supervisors and maintenance workers
understand the need for safety and the ways safety can be enhanced. This aspect has
been discussed in details in Chapter-2:Traffic Management of Volume-III:Operations &
Management.
b)
The Constraints
The maintenance engineer/personnel should be aware of any constraint that might affect
his performance and if there is any constraint, he should take appropriate measures to
eliminate the cause, if possible, or reduce its damaging effect, or avoid disruption of
traffic and other undesirable condition.
c)
Durability
It is intended that the Expressway be durable besides being safe. This would mean that
the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example wetting and drying,
freezing and thawing, if applicable, temperature differences, aggressive environment
leading to corrosion etc) in addition to the traffic shall be duly considered in determining
the most cost-effective treatment in order to preserve durability of the Expressway.

======================================================================
I V - 4
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
d)
Mitigating Disruptive Effects of Construction
The operation and maintenance of the Expressway should be planned and taken up in
such a way that the construction of Expressway does not have adverse impact on the
environment and does not disrupt the lives and business activities of the people living
close to the Expressway. Activities such as, painting, sanding, anti-icing, herbicide
application, mowing and brush control, landscaping and maintaining drainage, etc can
raise environmental objections. All material handling can have environmental safety
implications for the maintenance workers and the general public as well.
e)
State and Local Laws and Conditions
The maintenance engineer/personnel should be aware of the laws, bylaws, rules and
regulations, acts, circulars, etc of the State Government and Local bodies, especially
those related to disposal of surplus materials, handling of materials, maintaining water
bodies, landscaping with native plants, etc. The Maintenance Organization should also
be aware of local conditions including weather.
f)
Utility Service Providers
A utility corridor of 2 m width on each side of the expressway has been kept reserved.
The maintenance engineer/personnel shall be aware of the utilities present along and
across the expressway including the name, address and contact telephone numbers of
the utility providers.  Any fault or development within this corridor shall be intimated to the
respective utility providers.

carriageway, bridges, tunnels, and other structures;  cleaning and inspection for ensuring
the safety of road users; maintenance of information system for providing traffic information
on a continuous basis; as well as cleaning of service areas and wayside amenities.
The road maintenance engineers are required to keep expressways always in good
condition, at the same time improving the efficiency of maintenance system.
Under the circumstances, extensive expressway maintenance program may need to be
considered alongwith construction of expressway network. This may be broadly classified as:
•
Maintenance Works (Routine Maintenance): This covers inspection,
renovation, cleaning of road and associated facilities including recovery of
traffic accidents, etc.
•
Maintenance Repair: This covers pavement repair (all types of distresses),
bridge surfacing renovation and painting of metallic and concrete surfaces
to maintain the traffic requirements.
•
Improvement: This covers improvement of serviceability as well as structural
efficiency of the pavement, structures and environment, and
•
Disaster prevention: This covers the emergency measures/works to mitigate
the adverse effects of earthquakes, storms, and floods alongwith man made
casualties.
The objectives of these maintenance works are to:
•
Assure driving comfort and safety on expressway.
•
Preserve road and appurtenances, associated facilities with the purpose
of providing upgraded functional qualities.
•
Meet current social needs.
All these requirements are presented in Fig. 2.01.

Work
At the initiation of the maintenance operations, it would be necessary to study the secondary
data collected from the concessionaire and to plan inspection followed by evaluation and
judgment leading to maintenance planning of activities and finally performing the
maintenance work.   There are a number of factors which influence the manner and
effectiveness of the activities at the various stages.  Many of these factors are subject to
a wide range of variables.  The factors include:
-
Distance of work sites from the base of operations and the time and
expenses to transport personnel, materials, and equipment to work sites.
-
Weather conditions that can influence whether a repair can be made or the
nature of the materials and equipment that will be required.
-
Availability of skilled personnel, proper equipment and materials.
-
The size and grouping of each work package and whether it is within the
scope of resource availability and will it result in a high unit cost because of
transportation distance.  In such a situation, the preventive maintenance
measures may also be included.
-
Influence of unanticipated events, etc.
-
Traffic conditions at different time periods.
-
Possible outside influences such as labour contracts, local disturbances,
scarcity of suitable materials, etc.

INSPECTION
3.1
INSPECTION
Adequate and regular inspection is the key to success of a maintenance project.  Soon
after collection of the historical as-built and maintenance data, appropriate plan for
inspection shall be prepared.
3.1.1
General
All inspection and surveys that are required for planning and designing with regard to
operation and maintenance of the expressway shall be carried out in accordance with
•
IRC:SP:19–2001 : Manual for Survey, Investigations and Preparation of
Road Projects
•
IRC:SP:35-1990 : Guidelines for Inspection and Maintenance of Bridges
•
IRC:SP:54-2000 : Project Preparation Manual for Bridges
•
IRC:SP:52-1999 : Bridge Inspector’s Reference Manual
•
MORTH: Guidelines for Maintenance Management of Primary, Secondary
and Urban Roads and best industry practices. Inspection and Survey include
topographic survey, traffic survey, hydraulic and drainage survey, road and
bridge inventory and condition survey, material survey and pavement
investigation.
This Guideline explains the Inspection Process in a comprehensive manner.
All data generated from these inspections shall be properly referenced, compiled, validated
and presented in easily comprehensible forms, such as those prescribed in the publications
referred to above.
3.1.2
Types of inspection
Types of inspection are divided into the following three (3) categories:
i)
Routine Inspection:
Routine inspection is carried out on daily/weekly basis to identify road conditions
and traffic conditions. It shall be a visual inspection carried out from a moving



======================================================================

======================================================================
IV - 16
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: Maintenance
inspection vehicle with the occasional need of the observation on foot. It usually
consists of a team of two inspectors.
ii)
Periodic Inspection:
Periodic Inspection is primarily designed to carry out more detailed periodic
investigation of the relevant structures such as bridges and slopes on foot. Close
Inspection (with simple measuring tools and rebound hammers) of the structure
shall be done partially as full visual inspection is not possible in some cases

Inspection
a)
The lower part of an expansion joint cannot be inspected during Daily
Inspection as it is carried from a moving vehicle. However, if some damage
is detected on the joint surface, the entire joint should be inspected to
ascertain the level or extent of damage and its cause.
b)
Daily inspection for slopes may be carried within a visible range from a moving
vehicle. However if some distress/failure is detected, full/detail inspection
should be carried out to ascertain its stability or further imminent failures.
Structures within the ROW shall be inspected overall by an inspection group
consisting of engineers and technical staff.

iii)
Special/Emergency Inspection:
Special Inspection is defined as the supplementary inspection in addition to the
daily/weekly inspection and periodic inspection, for example, in the occasional
cases such as storm and heavy rain.
3.1.3
Frequency of inspection
Frequency of inspection is as follows:
i)
Routine inspection once a day or a week.
ii)
Periodic Inspection once a year/once every three (3) or six (6) months.
iii)
Special Inspection in case of necessary/additional/ad-hoc requirements/
situations.
Examples of the frequency of inspection are given in Table 3.01.

Maintenance Works and Repair
Accordingly, the roadwork should be performed under full safety provisions.
Surface Cleaning
i)
Type A Cleaning
This involves road surface cleaning by
sweeper, removing, sand and litter using
brush or vacuum type sweeper.  Areas
cleaned include main lines and ramp way
shoulders and their peripheries.  Cleaning
frequency is determined based on the traffic
volume of the areas involved.
Note:  a)
In northern snow countries, roadside soil and sand deposits often fly up in
early spring as a cloud of dust during cleaning works.  Since this can obscure
visibility, roads are often sprinkled to keep dust down.
b)
Soil, sand, etc. are dumped in compliance with legal restrictions as non-
industrial wastes.
ii)
Type-B Cleaning
In this operation, sprinkler trucks are used to
blow off soil, sand, etc. with the pressure of
water flushed through the sprinkler nozzle.
Note: a)
Careful attention should be paid at
sites 
where 
expressways
overpass highways.
b)
Cleaning work should be
suspended at locations where “No
snow dumping” signboards are
installed.
iii)
Type-C Cleaning
In this cleaning, litters, and other scattered obstacles such as cargoes slipped off from
running vehicles and wastes are removed manually by workers.  For this operation, 2 to 4
Type “B” cleaning (surface)
Type “A” cleaning (surface)



======================================================================
PAGE 196 of 316
======================================================================
IV - 52
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
ton capacity trucks are used.
Note: Since the cleaning truck stops and
starts anywhere on the road to pick up
litter, and this action is repeated often,
there is a hazard that passing vehicles
can hit the service truck while stopped
for a pick-up.  Therefore, swift pick-up
with appropriate safety precautions is
required.
iv)
Type-D Cleaning
This involves manual cleaning of roads not covered
by type A and B cleaning.  Soil, sand, litter, etc,
scattered on the surface within 1.5 m from road
edge, dropped cargoes, wastes and other
obstacles scattered on the road are removed
manually.  Trucks of 2 to 4 ton capacity are usually
used for this purpose.
Note: Refer to Type-C cleaning (road
surface).
Interchange and rest area cleaning
This involves manual cleaning of rest facilities
(parking areas and garden portions) and
interchanges (garden portions).
Classification:
-
Type A cleaning: Rest facilities
(parking place and road surface)
-
Type B cleaning: Rest facilities
(garden portions)
Type “C” cleaning (surface)
Type “D” cleaning (surface)
Types of cleaning in interchange
and rest area

Litter collected is carried by 2 to 4 ton capacity trucks.
-
Type A cleaning: Manual cleaning of
rest facilities (parking place and road
surface)
-
Type B cleaning: Manual cleaning of
service and parking areas (garden
portions)
-
Type C cleaning: Manual cleaning of
interchanges (garden portions)
Lavatory cleaning
This involves cleaning of toilets in the service
and parking areas, focused on 1) window, 2)
floors, 3) wash basin rooms, 4) stools and 5)
walls, using detergents.
Note: a)
Perform cleaning works during
non-rush hours.
b)
Place work signs outside the
lavatory being cleaned.
c)
Carefully clean the lavatory
avoiding water splash.
Crash barrier cleaning
This involves manual and mechanical cleaning of guardrails and handrails using detergents
to upgrade driving environment and improve delineation.   Tunnel cleaner is used for this
cleaning work.
Note:
Pre-check nearby streams to assure that no waste water flows into fish nurseries,
etc.

Cleaning of traffic signs
This involves detergent-applied manual cleaning of 1) traffic guide, regulatory and warning
signs, etc.  and 2) delineators, etc. for better visibility  from vehicles on highways.
High overhead signs are cleaned by crane trucks.
Note:
a)
Carefully wash high overhead signs so as not to splash water to passing
vehicles.
b)
If damaged on the surface, traffic signs lose power of reflection.  Wipe them
off with soft cloth.
c)
In cold, snowy locations, delineators are easily spoiled or stained.  They
should be cleaned as often as required.
-
Type A cleaning : This involves
manual cleaning of delineators,
kilometer 
posts 
and
emergency telephone signs.
-
Type B cleaning : This involves
manual cleaning of overhead

4.2.2.2
Pruning
This is the manual or mechanical cutting off of limbs and twigs of trees for better shape.
Pruning time varies with the species of trees planted.  Commonly, autumn (October through
November) is the best season for pruning coniferous trees.  For evergreen trees, the
ideal season for pruning is late spring to early summer (May through June) when new
buds halt growth after sprouting, and early autumn (September through October) when
summer shoots and long shoots stop growing up after second growth.  For deciduous
trees, July through August (the pre-typhoon season) when fresh green leaves have matured
into solid leaves, and November through March when leaves fall off the trees, are optimum
season for pruning.

4.2.2.5
Weed-vine clearing
Weed vines climbing trees are cut off manually.
Merely cutting off vines halfway is not enough as it
would permit their re-growth.  Vines should be
uprooted or eradicated using herbicides.  For this
operation, the best time of the year is early summer
(June through July) when vines are running out of
their stored nutrients and not ready yet to restore
new ones.
4.2.2.6
Irrigation
Water is supplied to soil by sprinkler truck.  Soil
should be irrigated during the dry summer
season and during the prime growth period of
plants and before they stop growing up.
Note: a)
In summer, irrigate trees in the
early morning or in the evening, but
not under direct sunlight during
daytime.
b)
Summer irrigation should not be
suspended halfway, but continued
until substantial rainfall.
4.2.2.7
Renovation of props and supports
Tree props and supports are renovated for the
purpose of protecting trees from falling,

4.2.2.8
Removal of props
Though it varies with the species involved,
trees get firmly rooted with their trunks
becoming solid and stable, about 6 to 10
years after planting.  As props are no longer
required at this time, remove them, beginning
with rotten ones.
4.2.2.9
Removal of decayed or damaged trees
Decayed or damaged trees not only spoil a
scenic view but may also result in spreading
trees infested with harmful insects.  Left
unattended, they could fall off by themselves
spontaneously.  Potentially, they can threaten
the health of local people and damage nearby
facilities, too.  For this reason, they should be
immediately uprooted.
4.2.2.10 Weed cutting
This involves manual cutting of weeds growing thick around young trees, preferably during
June through July when they lose
regenerative power.  Spread weeds cut off
around trees.  It is effective for curbing growth
of other weeds, keeping soil dry, protecting
surfaces soil and making it more fertile.
Note:
Cut down after September, a
season when weeds have stored
nutrients and trees are exposed to
cold wind should be avoided

4.2.2.11 Felling of deal trees
Felling of selected trees, including thinning of
forests and cutting obstructive trees where no
obstruction exists around the trees worked, they
are cut down at the base and branches are
removed.  On the other hand, where there is
any obstruction around them, trees are hung
on the wrecker and cut off at the base, or
manually suspended from the pulley with
branches to be removed first, followed by the
trunks which are to be cut by 1 to 2 meters from
the tip downward.
4.2.2.12 Lawn mowing
Mechanical mowing of turfs to renew stem
leaves, check growth of weeds and preserve
scenic view. Turfs should be mowed during July
through September, which is their prime growth
season.  Lawn mowers are commonly utilized
in large turfed areas besides interchanges,
service and parking areas and median strips.
4.2.2.13 Fertilizing turfs
It is more effective if turfs are manured during
March through May, concurrently with
placement of top dressing soil.  Select
manures to be used depending on the season
and frequency involved.
Note: a)
Preferably, turfs should be
fertilized when wetted with rainfall
or morning dew.
b)
Avoid fertilization in a dry season.
c)
Avoid or carefully use liquid
fertilizer or readily water soluble fe

This involves manual weeding of ground around
trees and turfed gardens.  It is more effective if
weeding is done during May through June for
spring and summer grass and during July through
August for autumn and winter grass to prevent
inhibiting growth of trees and turfs, harmful
insects and malfunctions to safety equipment.
Note: Weeds should be uprooted including
cpillary roots
4.2.2.15 Chemical spray
Chemicals are sprayed to curb growth of weeds
in a germinating phase and kill them in a growing
phase.  It is more effective if chemicals are sprayed
during April through May for spring and summer
grass, during July through August for summer and
autumn grass and during September through
October for autumn and winter grass.
Note: a)
Consult experts for the right  chemicals suited for the weeds to be uprooted.
b)
Carefully spray chemicals to avoid contact with human bodies. In the event of
contract, wash them away immediately.
4.2.2.16 Insecticide spray on turfs

Soil is filled up on the turfed ground to level
grass surface and curb overgrowth of turf buds.
It is effective if top dressing is applied during
March through May concurrently with
fertilization.  Sandy soil is ideal for top dressing.
It should be filled up thick enough (3 to 6 mm)
to cover the crest of buds, followed by roller
finish or irrigation.
4.2.2.18 Grass cutting
This involves manual and mechanical mowing of part of grassy area on the road shoulder
and roadside cut or embankment slopes.
Note: a)
Weeds cut off should be neatly packed into containers.

c)
Weeds should be cut off at any time as they can be a possible menace to
traffic safety, cause fire, spoil visibility of delineators or exert adverse effect
on nearby environment.
d)
Mechanical mowing can cause
pebbles, metal fragments, etc. to
fly at work sites.  Therefore,
remove them before mowing the

Work Flow:
Cleaning expansion system
Application of primer and release
Filling backup material
Injection of elastic sealant
Cleaning of expansion joint
Clear expansion joint of sand, soil, etc.
before cleaning. Remove rust and stains
from flume surface to enhance primer
cohesion
Application of primer and release agent
Coating joints with small gaps with primer
is an awkward job. Make sure that no part
of any joint is left uncoated.

Filling backup material
Urethane foam is injected into the drainage flume
of the expansion system and hard urethane foam
(in-site foamed) is injected to secure design
thickness of elastic sealant injected.
When filling in backup material, make sure
primer-applied surface has been kept dry. Use
extra care for edge treatment.

New generation road repair
In new generation of road repair, surface defects are repaired by recycling the existing
pavement material using the latest technique such as infrared technology to create a
quickly, seamless and longer-lasting repair.
Typical all in one vehicle
In the process a thermo-bond is created between the repair area and the existing
bituminous surface.  The work is performed in four steps as follows:
Step 1 :
The portable infrared heater is
positioned over the defect and heats
the surface area to approximately 160-
170°C.



======================================================================
PAGE 229 of 316
======================================================================
IV - 85
Maintenance Works and Repair
Step 2 :
The existing surface is re-worked. The heat generated by the infrared heater
creates a strong thermo-bond between the new material and the existing
surface, reducing potential future weak  points.
Step 3 :
A suitable rejuvenating
materials added to the
defective area.
Step 4 :
A small amount of material
from the on-board ‘hot box’
in the vehicle may be added
as required. Because the
existing 
material 
is
rejuvenated and reused, the
amount of new material
needed is minimised.  The
area is then raked and
compacted by a portable
plate vibrator transported in
the vehicle to create a
seamless joint.

MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS
5.1
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
5.1.1
General
The Operation and Maintenance of the Expressway shall be decided to ensure safety and
comfort at high speed travel as envisaged in design. All maintenance operations should
be planned in such a way that traffic movement is least affected.
The following areas need proper understanding and planning for maintenance :
•
Work Zone Safety
•
Environmental Protection
•
Inspection and Assessment
•
Defect Treatment
•
Proper equipment
The above points are explained hereafter.
5.1.2
Work zone safety
The following are the principles to enhance motorist and worker safety in maintenance
work areas:
•
Development of a comprehensive traffic control strategy that can be
implemented at the work site. Evaluation of the work operation, site, and
traffic conditions should determine the traffic control measures to be applied.
Refer to “Highway Safety Code (IRC: SP: 44)” and “Guidelines for Safety
in Construction Zones (IRC: SP: 55).”  Typical traffic regulation as practiced
in Japan is shown in Fig. 5.01 and Fig. 5.02:
The purpose of traffic regulation is to achieve safe maintenance work as well as causing
least disturbance to drivers.  In case of accident, heavy snow or fog it may be necessary to
have traffic control.  The traffic regulation activities are carried out in consultation with police
and the road administrator.  Depending on the degree of necessity, the traffic regulation
may be lane control, closing the shoulders, and diversion of all traffic to one lane.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
5.1.3
Environmental protection
The Concessionaire shall take utmost care to avoid damage or degradation to the
environment during maintenance activities. The term “environment” as used in this
Guidelines refers to the natural surroundings including soil, water, air, plant & animal life,
and archaeological and historical resources.
The maintenance engineers, technicians and operating crew must be aware of the
requirements for environmental protection in the performance of their duties. An
environmentally sensitive area may not be easily identifiable and may not appear to be so
obvious to untrained persons.
Some maintenance operations have potential for damaging or destroying archaeological,
historical, and sensitive biological resources, as well as culturally sensitive resources,
such as Native Plant gathering areas and sacred/holy sites.
Contamination of underground water supplies by hazardous substances (such as gasoline,
diesel, oil, and solvents), leaking from underground and above ground sources should be
promptly addressed with preventive measures.
Exhaust and crankcase emissions from vehicles and equipment running on petroleum
fuel are a prime source of the air contaminants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and
hydrocarbons.
Some of the Best Environmental Management practices are:
•
Use of environmentally sensitive cleaning and releasing agents eliminating
diesels and others solvents.
•
Adoption of appropriate water pollution control measures.
•
Arrangement of adequate erosion control supplies (e.g. diapers, kitty litter,
shovel, etc) to keep materials out of water bodies.
•
Disposal of excess materials at the designated site.
•
Performing surface works in dry weather to minimize runoff of potentially
hazardous materials.
•
Controlling of the width of cleaning/grading, where applicable, to minimize
disturbance of vegetation to control erosion.



======================================================================
PAGE 239 of 316
======================================================================
IV - 95
Maintenance Operations
•
Locating mixing plant at a distance of minimum 500 m from residences or
as per local statutory requirements.
•
Preparation of an adequate spill plan for running of hot-mix plant and
materials for spill containment.
•
Stabilisation of disturbed soil permanently using appropriate plants, seeding
or mulching.
•
Using protection measures, such as turfing, stone pitching, gabions, etc on
areas prone to erosion .
•
Preparedness to meet any eventuality arising out of heavy rains and flood.
•
In critical locations/ flood prone areas, making arrangements for necessary
materials and tools (e.g. sand, gunny bags, shovel, rope etc.) to meet
emergency requirement.
•
Using pesticides according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
•
Ensuring no contamination to the active flowing stream
•
Using water based paints that are more environment-friendly.
5.1.4
Inspection and assessment
Inspection report forms the base document for all maintenance operations. The
effectiveness and justification of the measures decided has to be evaluated and whether
further considerations are required or not, shall be decided prior to implementation.
5.1.5
Defect treatments – considerations and selection
The following are the major points to be considered while selecting a treatment for a
defect:
•
The prime cause of the defect.
•
Area/magnitude and severity of the defect
•
Suitability of the treatment selected based on:
-
prevailing climatic condition
-
expected life of treatment
-
interference with traffic
-
material, plant and crew requirement



======================================================================
PAGE 240 of 316

IV - 96
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
-
requirement of special material, equipment, or expertise
-
complexity of the process
-
safety requirement
•
Treatment or major maintenance is more appropriate to correct the problem.
•
Whether other major maintenance / repair / rehabilitation is already
scheduled for the area of the defect.
•
Whether the treatment requires any design and trial (for example, application
rates of binders,  mix designs, etc)
•
Priority of work with respect to safety.
•
Response time as per Inspection assessment.
5.1.6
Defect – treatment options
Any visible evidence of an undesirable condition in expressway asset is referred as a Defect.
It is advisable that the maintenance works are taken up based on the priority mentioned below:
1)
Safety and Legislative – All treatments, which are needed to restore safety
or correct defects that are legally unacceptable or required to fulfil obligations
as part of the works, may be given the highest priority. The treatments in
this group are also required to comply with the mandatory legislations.
2)
Preventive – All treatments, which prevent further deterioration/degradation,
may be given the second highest priority.
3)
Usability/Appearance – All treatments, which are needed for maintenance
of time related usability or appearance defects or the defects which do not
fall into either of the above two categories mentioned, may be given the
lowest priority.
A set of nine tables has been included as illustration and information (ready reference).
Table 5.01 presents activity wise summary of inspections along with possible/current
technical options to remedy the defects and are by no means meant to be “exhaustive
and unique” solutions.
However, for detailed maintenance treatment options, relevant latest IRC standards shall
be considered.

Mechanisation and equipment
5.1.7.1
Introduction
For expressway maintenance, it is a sine–quo-non to use mechanized activities to
deal with high speed, high volume traffic. The mechanized arrangement involves
fewer disturbances to the traffic and requires less number of associated safety
measures.
5.1.7.2
Equipment for maintenance
Maintenance equipment requirement will vary from region to region as well as
geographic areas surrounded by the expressway.
Table 5.02 (Source: AASHTO Maintenance Manual) presents a common list of
equipment required for performing various possible tasks of maintenance. These
are of informative as well as illustrative nature.

EQUIPMENT FOR DATA COLLECTION
6.1.1
Introduction
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Guidelines for Maintenance Management of
Primary, Secondary and Urban Roads – Published by IRC, New Delhi in year 2004 is a
comprehensive document.  This covers (i) database requirement for MMS; (ii) equipment
for data collection; (iii) man-power requirement; and (iv) equipment operations, calibration
periodicity of updating besides data base development, data analysis, organizational
requirement, intervention criteria and maintenance strategies.
In this Guideline, the aspects covered by the above document have not been reproduced
and it is expected that the maintenance engineer is aware of the contents.  The following
narrations are expected to be additional guideline for the decision making as well as to
be in line with the international practices.
6.1.2
Data collection
Different types of data are required for maintenance of the road infrastructure.
•
Inventory data describe the physical elements of a road system.
•
Condition data describe the condition of the elements that can be expected
the change over time.
There is a wide range of technologies available for measuring attributes of the road
network.  The challenge is to select the appropriate equipment, given local condition and
the way in which the data are expected to be used.
6.1.3
Types of pavement evaluations
Pavement evaluations record pavement characteristics that influence pavement
performance.  The key pavement characteristics considered in an evaluation are usually:
•
Roughness
•
Texture

Pavement data collection equipment
MORTH Guidelines for Maintenance Management of Primary, Secondary and Urban
Roads (published by IRC in year 2004) – presents data collection equipment for pavement
evaluation.
Pavement evaluations are performed in the field through manual surveys or using
specialized equipment.  Evaluated characteristics of the pavement are quantified by means
of indicators or condition indices.
Table 6.01 presents typical data collection equipment used to evaluate pavement
characteristics in the field.  Equipment are classified in terms of their precision and survey
method.

Examples of the different types of equipment available are given in Bennet et al. (2006).
Company profiles and brochures are available at www.road-management.info.
6.1.5
Bridge evaluations
Bridge structures suffer structural and functional deterioration as a result of structural
damage or material degradation. For this reason, bridge structures should be inspected
periodically, at time intervals dependent on the scope of the particular type of inspection.
6.1.6
Bridge inspections and data collection equipment
On bridge inspection and maintenance IRC (Indian Roads Congress) have published
the following documents, which cover inspection, data collection and evaluation.
•
IRC:SP:35-1990 (reprinted 2007) Guidelines for Inspection and
Maintenance of Bridges
•
IRC:SP:52-1999 (reprinted 2005) Bridge Inspector’s Reference Manual
Bridge data collection varies depending on the bridge component being surveyed.  Visual
inspections are normally used for all bridge components, but other applicable physical inspection
techniques vary with the material of bridge components. Table 6.02 summarizes the requirements.
6.1.7
Use of data collection equipment
6.1.7.1
Data collection for road surface conditions
In addition to the contents in the Ministry Maintenance Manual published by IRC in 2004,
the following equipment presented are being used in Japan and other countries. These
instruments are used for investigation and appreciation/assessment of pavement
surface. It can be used for inspection of cracks and other failures, including their
progression, on the pavement surface. For quantitative analysis of the pavement surface,
these vehicles check the roads for skid resistance, ruts, cracks and other surface
distresses and produce images of the same. The use of laser beam enables the vehicles
to work in night and operate around a speed of 60 kmph.
The CRRI has recently acquired an Accelerated Pavement Testing Facility for structural
evaluation of pavement on fast track basis with the support of Dynatest Technologies, with
the necessary know-how from CSIR, South Africa. The personnel of CRRI are being trained
for running and operation of this facility. This will help the concessionaires in quacker
prediction of pavement deterioration and taking timely remedial measures.

BITUMINOUS PAVEMENT MILL AND OVERLAY (including recycling)
Globally due to scarcity of good quality aggregates for bituminous work, recycling of the
existing distress pavement materials are being considered using various technologies.
Recycling process is generally categorized into in-situ recycling (where processing takes
place on site), and central plant recycling (where reclaimed material is processed off
site).  The process can be further divided into hot and cold processes.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
Loading of the road scraps into the dump
truck is followed by intensive cleaning with a
sweeper and/or compressor, to ensure that
no scraps are left on the road surface.
Tack coat is applied after sweeping and
cleaning to enhance the adhesion between the
new asphalt mixture and the existing pavement
surface.  Additional care shall be taken in
applying tack coat on the milled vertical face.
Final finishing and compaction shall be carried out at the earliest using appropriate paver
and roller combination, true to design line and level.

Along with the environmental benefits (road – tyre noise is less on porous asphalts surface
compare to bituminous surface), porous asphalt can suffer from problems, which can affect
both its performance and service life. The open structure exposes a large surface area to
the effects of air and water, leading to rapid aging of the binder which in turn leads to loss of
adhesion and particle loss.  Over the passage of time the interconnected pores (meant for
drainage of surface water) are prone to be blocked by the dirt, sand and other extraneous
materials such as spillage of chemicals and POL etc.” This will need maintenance.
6.3.2
Drainage
The structure of porous asphalt pavement should drain water to the drainage facilities (drainage
canal and side ditch etc.) as soon as possible, securing the inclination and smoothness of the
surface of the impervious layer.  In addition to this, if necessary, an underground drainage
system should be installed).  Typical drainage arrangement is shown in Fig. 6.02.
6.3
POROUS ASPHALT PAVEMENT
6.3.1
Introduction
Porous asphalt or open-graded asphalt is the result of advanced technology in pavement
design. It is used in the top layers, usually has an air void content of 20 percent or greater,
due to higher proportions of coarse aggregates and lower sand and filler content. As a
result of this composition, interconnected voids are created which, in wet weather, allow the
surface first to absorb water, preventing accumulation on the road surface, and then leading
it away, like a series of micro pipes, into a drainage system.  Porous asphalt is used in
many countries and offers a number of solutions to pavement problems. It is appreciated for
its benefits in noise reduction and improved safety under wet conditions. Fig. 6.01
demonstrates the reduction of splash and spray in a porous asphalt pavement in Japan

MICRO SURFACING – SPECIAL TREATMENT
Thin micro surfacing comprises of a coating over the pavement surface with a thin layer of
synthetic resin tightly bounded on the surface.  This is formed with special aggregates
such as emery or alumina sand.  Besides the places of high superelevation and steep
down grade micro surfacing is also applied at locations where the possibility of inadequate
surface friction is suspected.
6.5
RIGID PAVEMENT MILLING AND OVERLAYING
6.5.1
Pavement milling
Where concrete pavement develops heavy rutting, unacceptable on serviceability
consideration, the distress sections are milled using heavy cutting machine, cleaned and
shot blasted in order to prepare the surface for overlaying.

Shot blasting
Shot blasting removes loose pebbles, dust,
mud, etc. on the milled surface.
Water is sprayed to cool off milling bits due to
heat generated during milling. The water
sprayed on the bits turns pavement scraps into
sludge, therefore, road must be cleaned neatly.
A large, heavy milling vehicle with very hard
cutter bits capable of cutting concrete
pavement evenly is used.  Careful attention
must be paid to bit wear, as streaks may
appear in the surface being milled which
increases in severity with that of the bit wear.

WATERPROOFING BRIDGE DECKS
As a practice, the specifications for wearing
course over concrete bridge deck includes a
layer of mastic asphalt as waterproofing
membrane. However, in Japan a waterproofing
layer in the form of plastic sheet of 0.8 mm
thickness is placed over bridge deck.  This
waterproofing layer is suitably placed and
rounded on the corners and along the joint with
raised footpath (if any) to prevent infiltration of
water leaking in bridge face.  This waterproofing
work shall be integrated along with the bridge
drainage work.
Waterprofing Bridge Decks
Concrete is generally placed mechanically
to a thickness of 40 to 50 mm
Sufficient curing must be provided to
prevent shrinkage cracks

PROTECTION AGAINST SPALLING OF CONCRETE
6.8.1
Spray coating
Sealing of cracks in structures has been
specified in the MORTH - Specifications for
Road and Bridge Works published by IRC.
This covers the materials, activities, equipment
for injection along with testing and acceptance
procedures.
In Japan permeative and adhesive synthetic
resin is pressure injected into cracks in
concrete members.
Repair of Structures with Epoxy Resin
Spalling of concrete is mostly from the bottom of the
structures and generally is a result of corrosion
aggravation in coastal areas and by the pollutants in
the industrial areas.  The repair process involves
cleaning and chipping of the loose concrete, removal
of scalling (including rusting and flaking), applying
anticorrosive paint on the exposed reinforcement
surface, placing mesh reinforcement (chicken net) and
grouting / injection of cement slurry.  A spray coating of
anticorrosive properties may be applied as an
additional protection measure.   Typical protection against spalling is shown below:
6.8.2
Installation of steel plate
Step-1: Attach a continuous fiber sheet which adheres strongly to the existing concrete
which can conform to the deformation of the concrete surface.
Step-2: Steel plate is installed over the part of concrete slab at the soffit.
Step-3: Application of a protective layer which may be of concrete slurry or anti-corrosive paint.

6.9
PROTECTION AGAINST CORROSION AND SALT DAMAGE
Corrosion and salt damage is prevented by surface coating, surface coating after
rehabilitation of damaged sections, and cathodic protection, each of which is designed
to impede the progression of corrosion.
Infiltration of salinity into concrete structures may
come from exposure to a coastal/marine
environment or the use of sea sand or chemical
admixtures containing a large quantity of
chlorides, etc.  Corrosion of steel in concrete
can result in cracks, loss of adhesion with
reinforcing bars, surface float, stripping, etc. For
corrosion prevention, monitoring and remedial
measures IRC:SP:80 may be followed.
Severity of damage: The photo shows concrete
cracks triggered by infiltration of salinity on
concrete face, and by corrosion and dilatation
of internal reinforcing bars, illustrating the
presence of liquefied rusts.
Rust proofing chipped portions: If the
internal reinforcing bars are entirely corroded,
they are purged of rust and coated with a rust
proofing agent. Additional reinforcing bars are
added as required.

SPECIAL ROAD MARKING FOR IMPROVED DAY/NIGHT VISIBILITY
6.10.1
Introduction
Much of the visual information needed by a driver to navigate roads safely in a variety of
condition, including day/night, darkness, and adverse weather, is provided by pavement
markings.  Visibility during wet and night conditions is of particular concern.  The
retroflectivity, or amount of light reflected back to the source, of conventional pavement
markings is degraded under these conditions; water scatters light instead of returning it,
making the marking less visible.  This reduced visibility renders the driving task more
challenging because drivers have less tracking information.
6.10.2
Materials
Horizontal road marking materials which are fully visible in day light, can also guide road
users in the dark, due to the presence of glass micro beads on the surface.
The road marking materials are a mixture of glass aggregate and glass micro beads with
Moulds Injection



======================================================================

New Maintenance Practices
the road marking paint. Micro beads are coated with the hardener and ensure the
polymerization of the resin and retroreflection, which means that the marking technique
shall be open to any type of machine.
6.10.3
Applications
The thermoplastic materials with high visibility is applied using screed technique using a
special mechanism which has a control shutter to create the distinctive rib pattern of the
marking as illustrated below:
The diagram is schematic only and is intended
to give indicative shape.
Because of the protruding shape even during
wet night time, it does not lose visibility.  With
its rumble shapes, when the vehicles over ride
the marking a sensible and audible impulses
are transmitted to the driver. These impulses
alert the driver and increase the safety in driving.

TUNNEL MAINTENANCE
6.11.1
Inspection
The inspection of tunnels is broadly divided into two categories:
i)
The inspection of civil engineering structures such as lining, portals, interior
boards, ceiling slabs, and drainage facilities; and
ii)
Checking and maintenance of facilities including ventilation system,
machines and equipment, and the communication system. Salient major
aspects generally considered are as follows:
Inspection of Civil
Engineering Structures

Routine Inspection: the condition of the road and how it is
being used is routinely checked at a range recognizable
from a car.

Periodical Inspection: inspection at close range by a staff
on foot. In the case of tunnels, checking from the inspection
gallery is the rule. If the need arises, inspection from a lift
car is carried out by restricting traffic (once a year).

Emergency Inspection: to supplement daily and periodical
inspection, emergency inspection is made as the occasion
demands (whenever required).
Inspection/ Maintenance
of Facilities

Routine Inspection machines and equipments in working
condition are checked from outside for any abnormality,
using the experienced inspector’s judgment and within the
range of built -in measuring instruments. Simple mending
and cleaning are also carried out.

Periodical Inspection: more detailed checking than daily
inspection in performed periodically on machines and
equipment to ensure there is no abnormality. Cleaning,
occasional functioning tests, and detailed measurement
using special measuring instruments are carried out.

Emergency Inspection: inspection is performed if serious
damage is caused to machines or equipment of the facilities
by fire or accident or if any problem is foreseen ( as and
when required).
6.11.2
Maintenance/improvement work
Since, tunnels are closed structures, maintenance is necessary in view of disaster
prevention.  To keep pace with technical progress, emergency facilities have always been
modified or updated as frequently as possible.  To prevent accidents, measures such as

New Maintenance Practices
improving lighting equipment, paving in brighter colours, and visual guidance for improved
visibility shall be adopted.
Tunnel-related maintenance work includes cleaning surface, cleaning attachments to the
road such as interior boards and tiles on the side walls of inspection gallery, and cleaning
drainage facilities and tunnel lighting facilities.  The frequency of cleaning depends on the
traffic volume. Various inspection and maintenance data shall be comprehensively
examined, and the timing of re-inspection and detailed investigation shall be decided
while immediate solving of an urgent problem involving accidents, machine breakdowns,
etc. need to be considered in order to ensure safe travelling in the tunnel.
The tunnels being an enclosed area with arrangements for lighting, ventilation, wall finishes
and safety measures need special considerations.  Cleaning of tunnel walls, ventilation
and lighting system need use of chemical solvents (specially for soots), pressurized heated
water and mechanical devices. All these require skilled maintenance technicians.
Moreover, maintenance in tunnel is difficult under high speed traffic conditions or partial
lane closures which may cause severe traffic congestion and may become prone to
accidents.  Maintenance of tunnel must be accomplished with minimal time spent in tunnel.
For expressway tunnels, to maintain speed and safety mechanized cleaning and
maintenance is a necessity.  NEXCO practices using various machines are presented as
follows:

Tunnel water leakage
The water leakage inside tunnel is generally through the joints of precast concrete
segments, faulty/cracked shotcrete, rock bolt connection, seepage through concrete
lighting from rock/earth overburden.  The water leakage treatment can be broadly grouped
as (i) joint treatment for tunnels with lining and (ii) random treatment for tunnels without
lining.   A typical tunnel repairing in Japan is shown below :

Introduction
To meet the requirement of specialized equipment for maintenance of Expressway, the
concessionaire may not have or may not like to have the required fleet of equipment.
These maintenance equipment are capital intensive and are generally of less frequent
usage for data collection which may lead to considerable idle time, and maintenance
operation is prone to become expensive.  For economic use of the maintenance fleet of
equipment, it may be prudent to form a separate expressway maintenance company which
may serve multiple concessionaires (i.e. for longer sections of expressways) in a
coordinated manner.

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
7.1
INTRODUCTION
For high speed Expressway maintenance, there is need for a planned strategy of cost-
effective time saving treatments for the roadway system and its essential appurtenances
which preserve the system, retards future deterioration, and maintain or improve the
functional conditions of the system (without substantially increasing structural capacity but
deferring potential major rehabilitation).
AASHTO’s observations on preventive treatment were summed up quite nicely by defining
the preventive maintenance as “applying the right treatment to the right pavement at the
right time”.  Fig. 7.01 presents the trigger levels of preventive treatment and likely
rehabilitation level on conceptual basis.
Preventative Maintenance takes a proactive approach in maintenance of the expressway
network reducing time-consuming rehabilitation and reconstruction and the associated
traffic disruptions.  Timely preservation can ensure improved mobility, reduced congestion
and safer, smoother, long lasting expressway network.
The key is to apply the treatment when the pavement is still in relatively good condition
and no structural damage.

NECESSITY OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
Inspection is the key element in maintenance and triggers all the necessary activities,
consequently prepares the resource requirement.  Preventive maintenance will emerge
from inspection evaluation as follows:
Corrective intervention
Inspection assessment ranking ‘AA’
Maintenance
Preventive intervention
Inspection assessment ranking ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’
Refer Table 3.03 : Typical Ranking of Inspection in Chapter-3.
Inspection Assessment ranking ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ will form basis for preventive maintenance
•
By detecting an early symptom of deterioration
•
And checking the development pattern of deterioration
•
It is possible to find an optimal intervention level to arrest the deterioration
These will assist in planning a mid/long – term maintenance strategy
7.3
BENEFITS OF PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
The benefits associated with preventive maintenance, both perceived and documented, vary
from place to place and depend on the strategic objectives.  The following benefits are obtained:

7.4
CONCLUSIONS
A preventive/preservative or proactive approach entails the application of a series of low
cost maintenance treatments which are expected to last for a few years.  The key is to
apply the treatment when the subject element is still in relatively good condition and no
structural damage.
The end result will be an extension of the service life of the expressway network instead of
having to rehabilitate / reconstruction.  And, this translates into savings in resources.  It is
important to realize that no pavement lasts for ever, and preventive activities do not stop a
pavement or appurtenances from eventually deteriorating. These are intended to reduce
the rate of deterioration and to make expressway maintenance more cost effective and to
cause less disturbance to the users.

Overall measures can be grouped into three phases: regular work, pre-event measures
and post-event measures. First, consideration of disaster reduction in the regular work
consisting of planning, design, construction, and management is most crucial for mitigating
natural hazards to roads.
Pre-event measures include damage potential assessment, retrofit work, and disaster
preparedness.
Post-event measures consist of emergency measures (emergency survey and emergency
operation) and repair work.  Emergency survey is a quick survey to understand the nature
and degree of damage to roads and facilities, with objectives of responding to the needs
of emergency operation and repair.  From the emergency survey, the management staff
should obtain an outline of all concerned damage.

Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
Emergency operation may consist of disaster relief aid for rescuing and searching for
victims, and also actions for avoiding successive hazards which often follow the original
event.  Activities to close and restrict the use of damaged roads and to install temporary
supports for preventing complete collapse or partial damage to structures are typical
emergency operations.   The emergency survey and emergency operation will often be
conducted consecutively as emergency measures.
8.2
PRE-EVENT PREPAREDNESS MEASURES
Vulnerability of Road Network: In addition to damage potential assessment, pre-event
preparedness measures are also very important.
Road management offices should thoroughly understand the vulnerability of road networks
in the region concerned and availability of detours.  Future additions of road networks
should be considered for areas where most roads, including detours, are likely to seriously
suffer from hazards.
Road Management Systems:  Road offices should improve management systems with
consideration of the following factors:
i)
Collection of road damage information
ii)
Needs for emergency measures and repair
iii)
Cooperation with construction and materials delivery industries
iv)
Consultation with disaster experts
v)
Storage of construction materials and equipment for emergency use
vi)
Duty staff to be on call in case of emergency
Education, Training and Exercises: Road maintenance staff should be aware of possible
results of road damage and the effects on society and on economic activities.  Training
exercises that assume a hypothetical disaster are effective in getting the staff accustomed
to disaster situation.  In these exercises, emphasis should be placed on actions to be
taken just after road damage, and on procedures for communicating disaster information
among the road office staff.
8.3
POLICY AND ORGANIZATION FOR REPAIR
Procedures for Repair Work: When a hazardous event causes serious damage to roads



======================================================================

and related facilities some of the following measures should be taken, based on the type
and magnitude of the disaster.
i)
Call of staff members
ii)
Setup of emergency organization system
iii)
Emergency survey and emergency operation
iv)
Road closures and traffic restrictions
v)
Temporary repair
vi)
Permanent repair
Emergency Organisation: For smooth repair of damaged roads, it is effective to set up a
special organization which copes exclusively with the repair work.  When establishing a
special system to cope with a serious road disaster, the following factors should be
carefully considered.
i)
Assignment of each staff member’s role
ii)
Sufficient number of staff members for field teams
iii)
System for instruction and information collection
iv)
Portable communication system between responsible staff members
v)
Consultation with experts and supervisors
vi)
Cooperation with specialized companies
vii) Good care of staff health
Repair Plan and Repair Priority:  In planning repair of damaged roads, the degree of the
entire disaster, characteristics of the affected area, traffic demand, and repair priority
should be considered.
Traffic Management:  Traffic management should be adequately enforced, taking into
account the pattern and degree of road damage.  Appropriate control should be selected
from different traffic control measures such as (a) complete closure, and (b) partial
restriction in kind or weight of vehicles, time of  opening, driving speed, lanes to open, or
alternating one-way use.
Information Communication and Public Relations : For smooth implementation of repair
work, it is essential to have a good system for accurate information communication.  In



======================================================================
PAGE 300 of 316
======================================================================
I V - 156
Guidelines for Expressways VOLUME-IV: MAINTENANCE
communicating with related organization immediately after a serious disaster, public
telephones may not be available.  In such cases, disaster priority telephones, radio phones,
or wireless phones may work effectively.  Availability and effectiveness of these emergency
communication media should be checked during normal times.
It is also important to work on public relations and provide local residents with updated
information on road damage and repair prospects.  Mass media such as newspaper,
radio and television may be effectively employed for this purpose.
8.4
EMERGENCY MEASURES
Emergency Survey: Emergency survey is to obtain an outline of all the damage to road
networks.  In addition, it is crucial to identify damaged portions which have high potential
for subsequent complete collapse.
From the emergency survey, the necessity to close roads or restrict their use should be
judged in view of the relation between degree of road damage and road traffic use.  An
outline of damage to important structures such as long bridges should also be obtained.
It is also essential to transmit the results of the emergency survey to the Director at the
headquarters office as soon as possible.
Emergency Operation: When serious road damage happens and causes accidents and
injuries, the road management office should undertake first aid operations to rescue and
search for victims, in cooperation with emergency aid organizations such as police and
fire stations.
When damaged portions likely to result in complete collapse are found from the emergency
survey, emergency operations such as closure and restrictions of road use, identification
of dangerous areas, and warnings to road users should be executed promptly.  In this way,
subsequent hazards can be avoided.

PROTECTION OF SLOPES AGAINST DISASTER
8.6.1
Concrete block frame
This is to provide the slope with protection against erosion and weathering by rainwater,
and against gully erosion.  It is also used in areas where soil is not suitable for vegetation

but has to be planted for environmental considerations.
To protect slopes from the fire hazard generated from passing vehicles, concrete block
frame (filled with flat blocks or cobbles) is applied to slope toes to a height of about
2 m from road surface, providing non-combustible protection. This method cannot withstand
earth pressure, and it is expensive compared to vegetation cover/turfing.  As a result, its
application is subject to careful studies.

i)
Concrete block frames should be applied only to gentle slopes with a gradient
of over 1V:1H in consideration of workability and potential degeneration of
packed cobbles.
ii)
The standard thickness of concrete frame members is 15 cm for open-cut
section and in a range of 10-12 cm for embankment.
iii)
It is preferable to avoid the use of these concrete block frames in snow
belts where the soil can freeze and degenerate frame members.  Even in
unavoidable cases, its application should be limited to gentle slopes with a
gradient of 1.2V:1H or more.
iv)
For water springs, it is necessary to install an underground drainage system
across the slope, along with other steps necessary to dispose of spring
water, prior to the installation of concrete block frames.

Though the severity of aging varies with the mix design when constructed, time sprayed,
geological conditions (spring water, etc.) weather conditions, etc., sprayed slopes are
subject to aging, such as cracks, upheaval, exfoliation, etc, and loss of initial properties
over a prolonged period.
This can pose a problem with road operation, especially when peeled concrete fragments
drop over road surface.  Aged concrete can be cured by overspray or respray.

Installation of rock fall protection net
The rock fall protection net is designed to forestall rock fall and guide fallen rocks to slope
toes without allowing them to hit the highway.  The protection net is often installed on
slopes of rock mixed with gravel and pebbles.  Slopes are covered with wire net after the
removal of withered and decayed grasses and boulders.

Treatment of boulders
Rock fall protection work involves the crushing
of rocks and gravel, consolidation of the
foundation, the setting of wire ropes, etc.  An
appropriate countermeasure should be selected
based on a detailed field survey of the slope
topography and geology, the growth of
vegetation, and on pre-assessment of
workability, durability and maintainability.  In

Concrete block masonry
This work is designed to protect bank and open-cut slopes and prevent minor collapse of
the base of slopes, applied to a case where earth pressure is low since bedrock behind
the slope is solid.
Work Flow
Concrete block masonry
Concrete blocks are laid on the slope with manual
concrete-filling and back-filling.  In filling concrete,
concrete must be tightly compacted to avoid the
occurrence of gaps near edges or joints.

Girder linkage: This work is designed to
prevent bridge fall down by way of a chain
connection of abutments with girders, or
making the girders jointless.
Edge expansion: This work is designed to
prevent bridge fall down by expanding the
width of the piers, etc.

Reinforcement of piers
Bridges have been reinforced in substructures to withstand earthquakes of an intensity
equal to that of the Hyogoken Nanbu Earthquake, precluding the possibility of heavy
damage to road functions.  Piers can be reinforced by RC lining, steel plate lining, CFRP
lining, extra foundation piles, etc.  In addition, cofferdam work using sheet piles has been
introduced in order to curb displacements in abutments and back-fills as a result of quake-
triggered ground slide.  An optimum construction method should be selected after analysis
of ground conditions, potential impact on the main line, bridge structure, etc.

DISASTER RESTORATION
In the event of a natural disaster, maximum effort should be made to minimize secondary
damage to third parties and to bring prompt recovery of traffic and transportation.
Disaster restoration measures cover:
i)
Temporary restoration directed to safeguard people against secondary
disasters and to recover traffic through emergent restoration of highways,
and
ii)
Permanent restoration: implemented after the in-depth analysis of causes
of the collapse, and investigation of neighbouring areas as well as the
location which suffered.
