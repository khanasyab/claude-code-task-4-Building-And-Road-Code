GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
OF REINFORCED SOIL WALLS
BACKGROUND
The IRC B-3 Sub-group headed by Prof. Sharad Mhaiskar has drafted the "Guidelines for
Design and Construction of Reinforced Soil Walls" by working assiduously over the last 4
years.
In the intervening period the FHWA, British codes issued revised editions in 2009 and
201 0 respectively. MORTH has promulgated guidelines in 201 3 which gave brief Specifications
for Reinforced Soil Walls. The guidelines before finalisation have been shared with
all the
stakeholders ranging from manufacturers, designers, consultants, owners and contractors.
During the deliberations the sub-committee received diverse suggestions from stakeholders
based on their understanding, experience and interest. However, while drafting the guidelines
it has been ensured that the design as well as construction proceeds in a safe and conservative
manner, keeping
in mind the complications faced
in addressing serviceability issues post-
construction. Experience gained
in adopting RS Wall technology on several projects
in the
country helped the group in drafting these guidelines. State of construction practices as well
as QA and QC procedures followed
in the country have been uppermost in the mind while
drafting the provisions of the guidelines.
Several crucial issues
like estimation of O, testing of reinforcement as well as connection
testing, reinforced and retained soil/fill testing, causes of failure, design methods, classification
of reinforcement
in
to extensible and
inextensible types and special cases of geometry,
have been addressed
in the guidelines. The design principles are based on the limit state
approach. The guidelines also include a worked example to demonstrate the provisions
in
the guidelines.
The initial draft document on "Guidelines for Design and Construction of Reinforced Soil Walls"
was discussed in number of meetings of B-3 Committee and document was approved by the
B-3 Committee
in
its meeting held on 14.05.2013 for placing before the BSS Committee.
BSS Committee
in
its meeting held on 18.7.2013 decided that B-3 Committee should
first
finalise the document based on the comments received and forward the same to IRC Sectt.
for circulating amongst H-4 Committee members for holding the joint meeting of B-3 and H-4
Committees.
Accordingly,
draft was reviewed by H-4 Committee members and was further discussed
in number of meetings of B-3 and H-4 Committees. This document was then discussed
and finalised
in the joint meeting of B-3 and H-4 Committees held on 23.11.2013 and then
discussed again in the meeting of working group constituted by B-3 and H-4 Committees on
3.12.2013. Alongwith the H-4 Committee members (Shri RJ. Rao, Ms. Minimol Korulla, Shri
Atanu Mandal,
Shri Rajiv Goel and others), valuable suggestions and contributions were
received from Shri N.K. Sinha, Dr. M.V.B. Rao, Dr. B.R Bagish, Shri Alok Bhowmick, Shri R.R.
Chonkar, Shri. Shahrokh Bagli, Prof. M.R. Madhav and others. The contribution and guidance
of the Shri PL. Bongirwar, Convenor, B-3 Committee and Shri S.G. Joglekar Co-convenor,
B-3 Committee has been immense during the course of the drafting of the guidelines.
Promulgation
of these
guidelines
will
ensure
that the RS
Walls
will
be designed and
constructed with great care and diligence, and would stand the test of time.

1 INTRODUCTION
Reinforced Soil (RS) Walls are
in use for more than 40 years world over and for the last 25
years in India and are increasingly being adopted in highway and bridge construction. These
applications call for use of relatively new technology and materials. The developments in the
theory, design methods and experience of the behaviour of RS Walls gained
in laboratories,
full scale tests and
field applications
in
India and abroad have brought knowledge from
developmental stage
to widespread
applications
in hands
of
practicing
engineers.
This
powerful method
will be increasingly adopted
in road and bridge
projects.
Publication of
these guidelines (referred as 'Guidelines' hereafter) covering the design and construction
methods for benefit of the new as well as existing users
is overdue, as need
is felt to bring
consistency
in design and philosophy adopted by various system suppliers and to ensure
minimum standard and criteria for acceptance of materials so that design
life of 100 years
is assured and to bring uniformity
in
partial load factors and
partial material safety factors
fulfilling a long standing need in the field of Highways and Bridges Engineering.
2 SCOPE
The design and construction of approaches retaining
soil/fill leading to the open spans of
bridges, flyovers, road over-bridges crossing railways and retaining walls of high fills for road
embankments are covered
in these Guidelines. Reinforced soil improves the load carrying
capacity and reduces compressibility under the load. Technical details of such applications
are outside the scope of the Guidelines. The use of RS Walls as abutment to carry the loads
from open spans
is not covered by these guidelines. Reinforced Soil Structures with slope
angle of less than 70 degrees to the horizontal are not covered by these guidelines.
The coverage of Guidelines includes, but is not limited to:
.
-
•
Materials and
properties of reinforcement as well as the
soil used
in
its
construction
•
Types of reinforcements,
fills, and facings
•
Testing of materials
•
Design methods
•
Broad method of construction to realise desired properties and behaviour of
RS Walls
•
Overview of non-conventional ground improvement methods used
in RS
Walls.

3 ELEMENTS OF RS WALLS, MATERIALS THEIR PROPERTIES
Fig.1
shows
the elements
of a
Reinforced
Soil
Wall.
Following
sections
describe
the
characteristics of materials used
in construction of RS Walls.
In addition to the reinforcing
elements, the performance of the reinforced soil structure hinges on retained
fill, reinforced
fill and the aggregates used
in the drainage bay and/or other measures used for ensuring
drainage.

Typical Cross Section for RS Wall
3.1
Retained soil/fill
The retained
fill
in case of 2 lane and 4 lane highway projects where the total width
is not
very significant shall be of same specification as reinforced
fill. However,
in the case of six
lane projects or four lane with slope surcharge
it
is experienced that large quantity of
fill
is
required.
In case the retained
fill
is not available in requisite quantity,
fill meeting the criteria
mentioned below may be used.
a)
Recommended properties:
i)
Angle of internal friction ((}))> 25°
ii)
Plasticity Index < 20
The configuration of retained
fill
is shown in Figs. 2A and 2B.

Retained
Fill of Different Specifications in 6 Lane Highways and Expressways of
Varying Width (Figure Not to Scale)
Retained
soil can be natural or borrowed. Properties of the retained
soil are essential to
determine the
lateral earth pressure.
In case configuration as per Fig. 2A
is adopted the
earth pressure acting on the reinforced
fill
will be a function of angle of friction of retained
fill. The friction value of the retained
fill
in this arrangement will be lesser than that of the
reinforced
fill. Hence the earth pressure acting on reinforced
soil mass
will be more than
the earth pressure compared to the case where the
fill material
in both zones are identical.
Another possible configuration of retained
fill
is shown
in Fig. 2B.
In this arrangement since
the retained
fill
is extended upto conventional Rankine's failure zone, the earth pressure
acting on the reinforced zone
is same as per the properties of reinforced
fill.
Properties
of the retained
soil/fill
like grain size
distribution, angle of internal
friction (under drained
and undrained conditions), Atterberg limits, density, and permeability should be determined
before proceeding with design.
If a retained
fill is not permeable, drainage should be ensured
by providing a drainage bay between the retained and reinforced
fill as well as the retained
soil and the founding soil,
if required.
For the retained soil, the value of phi considered in design should be arrived at using a similar
approach for the reinforced soil as outlined
in the subsequent sections.
3.2
Reinforced Soil/Fill
The reinforced
soil/fill
is essentially borrowed.
Properties of this
soil
play
crucial
role
in
the performance of the RS structure. The
soil
is borrowed from quarries,
river beds
etc.
It
is essential to know
if the material borrowed would be consistent with reference to the
quantity required and
if not, what levels of variations are
likely. Besides performance, the
cost of the RS structure
is also sensitive and dependent on the properties of the reinforced
soil.
It is desirable that the reinforced
fill be free draining with majority of the shear strength
component derived from internal friction. The desirable gradation of the reinforced fill is shown
in Table
1. The gradation proposed would ensure that the
fill
is well graded, free draining
and has adequate shear strength once
it
is compacted.
Properties of the reinforced
soil
like grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, drained shear strength (peak as well as residual
value), permeability, maximum dry density and OMC as obtained from a Heavy Compaction
Test (corresponding
to Modified
Proctor Test) or
relative density (whichever applicable),
compactibility should be determined before proceeding with design with great care.

The backfill should also have Plasticity Index, PI < 6 and Cu > 2.
Soil/Fill with more than
15 percent passing 75 micron
sieve,
but less than 10 percent of
particles smaller than 15 microns are acceptable provided
PI
is less than 6 and angle of
friction
is not less than 30°.
As a result of recent research on construction survivability of geosynthetics and epoxy coated
reinforcements,
it
is recommended that the maximum
particle size for these materials be
reduced to%- in. (19 mm) for geosynthetics, and epoxy and PVC coated steel reinforcements
unless
construction damage
assessment
tests
are
or
have
been
performed
on
the
reinforcement combination
with
the
specific
or
similarly graded
large
size
granular
fill.
Pre qualification tests on reinforcements using
fill
materials should be conducted before
proceeding with design.
While using metallic reinforcement or metallic connection system,
it should be ensured that
electro-chemical properties of the fill are satisfactory and would not cause or trigger corrosion
of the reinforcement.
It
is desirable that
soil should have a
resistivity > 5000 ohm-cm
at
saturation. Metal reinforcement should not be used for soils with resistivity less than 1,000
ohm-cm.
Soils with
resistivity between 1000 to 5000 ohm-cm may be used provided the
water extract from the soil does not show chlorides more than 100 ppm., sulphates do not
exceed 200 ppm, and pH ranges from 5-10. Water used for compaction shall have resistivity
more than 700 ohm-cm. Besides, the water used for compaction shall comply to permissible
limits specified by iS-456-2000
i.e. Sulphates as SO3 400 mg/lit.. Chlorides 2000 mg/l, and
pH not less than 6, organic content 200 mg/l, suspended matter 2000 mg/l.
Flyash confirming to IRC:SP- 58 can be used as reinforced as well as retained
fill.
The quality of flyash should be controlled through periodical checks to ensure consistency
and compliance to specifications.
In many regions of the country reinforced
fill as mentioned above
is not available. Clayey/
Sandy Gravel (residual soil)
, classifying as GC, GM or GC-GM. may be used provided the
fines content (defined as combined percentage of
silt and clay
i.e. -75 micron
soil) does
not exceed 20 percent. At the same time additional precautions,
if required, to ensure that
hydrostatic as well as pore pressure
is not developed by providing adequate surface and
sub-surface drainage system should be undertaken.
It is emphasized that the order of preference of reinforced
fill
is as follows:-
a)
Clean,
free
draining,
non-plastic
fill
meeting
gradation
and
plasticity
requirements specified earlier
5

IRC:SP:102-2014
b)
Flyash confirming to !RC:SP-58.
c)
Residual/soil Murum
meeting above
requirements
with due
precautions
mentioned above.
d)
Any other mechanically stabilised
soil, blended by mechanical equipment
and meeting gradation and other requirements mentioned above may be
also used.
In many situations the reinforced
fill and retained soil
is same. Retained soil properties are
used to calculate the lateral pressures;
it is desirable to use value of O using the approach
suggested
for the
reinforced
soil, so
that the appropriate
lateral pressure
is evaluated.
Properties (principally shear strength and density) of the reinforced
fill determine the length
and tensile strength of the reinforcement.
It
is therefore desirable that the angle of internal
friction should be evaluated considering the variability in the backfill, compactibility, state of
quality control practised across the country etc.
For lateral pressure as well as for reinforcement calculations (strength as well as length)
^design should be taken as Op^^^. The value of
may be obtained by conducting a drained
direct shear test as prescribed by IS 2720 part IV. The Direct Shear Test shall be conducted
at 95 percent of Modified Proctor Maximum Dry Density or 80 percent of Relative Density.
Where the
fill contains gravel percentage more than 10 percent
it is advisable to carry out a
direct shear test using a 305 x 305 mm. direct shear box.
These recommendations are on the assumption that adequate drainage
is ensured
in the
reinforced as well as retained zones.

in no case shall exceed 34 degrees or average
value of Opgg^ minus 2
* standard deviation based on the number of tests prescribed
in
section 4.2, as far as the reinforced
fill
is concerned, except for GM-GC soils satisfying the
properties mentioned in the next paragraph.
Where the soil classifies as GM or GC,
is acceptable as per gradation and plasticity norms
and
if
it is ensured that 80
- 90 percent of the quantity of material
is available for the project
value of O^gg.g^ may be based on the results of the large size direct shear box tests mentioned
above with a limiting value of 38 degrees.
3.3
Drainage Bay
Normally, RS
structures are
not designed
for
hydrostatic
pressures. Where
hydrostatic
pressures are likely due to submergence, the design should account for such pressure. To
ensure that these conditions are realised in the field, adequate drainage measures need to be
taken. A drainage bay of minimum 600 mm width at the back of the facing is commonly used.
Appropriately,
profiled blocks are also used for the facia which have provision for placing
granular drainage. The desirable gradation of the aggregate used
in the bay is indicated
in
Table 2. Besides meeting gradation requirements
it should be ensured that the aggregates
are not friable,
flaky, elongated and are sound
in strength. Relevant tests as per MORTH
2013 specifications may be used to judge the suitability of the material used in the drainage
bay.

Alternatively,
a

may
be
provided.
Specifications for Geo-composite should be as recommended
in MORTH
Specifications-
2013 Tables 700-9 and 700-10.
Where RS Walls are provided to support hill cuts, the face of the hill cut is to be considered as a
retained
fill. To ensure that the run -off and sub-surface water is drained, a drainage bay should
be provided between the retained soil and the reinforced soil to ensure proper drainage. The
drainage bay should be designed to carry the discharge and should be provided vertically at
the back of the retained
fill and continued in a horizontal extent to a depth well below the toe
of the RS Wall and lead to a drain meant to carry the discharge away from the RS Wall.
3.4
Facing Elements
The facing
is provided
to prevent
spilling/falling over of the
fill and
also
to provide
firm
anchorage to the reinforcement. Facings should be tough and robust. Facing also provides
an aesthetic architectural finish to the RS structure.
The facing system shall be one of the following (Refer MORTH specifications -2013)
a)
Precast reinforced concrete panels
b)
Precast concrete blocks and precast concrete hollow blocks
c)
Gabion facing
d)
Wrap around facing using geosynthetics
e)
Metallic facing, prefabricated
in different shapes including welded wire grid
and woven steel wire mesh
f)
Other proprietary and proven systems
The facing should be designed to withstand the stresses
it
is subjected
to. Typically the
normal stresses arising would be due to the panels/blocks above
it and forces and moments
arising due to connections to reinforcement.
Connection between the facia panels and the reinforcing element shall be done by using
either nut or bolt, HDPE inserts with bodkin joint, hollow embedded devices, polymeric/steel
strips/rods/pipes, fibre glass dowels or any other material shown
in the drawings. Several
types of connections are being used.
In case of modular block facing where the reinforcement is held by friction between the facia
block and the reinforcement, the results of pullout test as per ASTM D 6638 shall satisfy the
requirement of the Long Term Design Strength of the primary reinforcement.
In the case of block facing the reinforcement
is held by
friction between the
reinforcing
element and the blocks. The connection strength is based on the friction between the blocks

Concrete (minimum M35 concrete strength) panels sliould be of minimum 140 mm. thickness
(at its minimum), excluding architectural finishes and reinforced as per design requirements,
unless otherwise validated by load tests and project reference.
Modular blocks should be manufactured using a block making machine and cast from a
cement sand mix to attain a minimum concrete strength (M35) of 35 N/mm^. In case of blocks,
the hollow area shall not exceed 40 percent of the cross sectional area. The outer side of
the block shall have a minimum thickness of 85 mm and the inner side 45 mm. Blocks may
also be profiled to create hollows between adjacent blocks The hollow space shall be filled
with clean, 20 mm. down sound, aggregate to add to friction between the reinforcing grid
and facia blocks. The blocks and panels manufactured should have consistency/uniformity
in dimensions and shape.
The facing chosen should be compatible with the extensibility of reinforcement. Compatibility
to ensure flexibility of the system should be attained by choosing an appropriate combination
of fascia and reinforcement.
The RS Wall system may be accepted by the Engineer-in-Charge
if
it has certification for
material (mainly reinforcement) and connection strength, from accredited laboratories referred
in IRC:113-2013andTabfe3.
In addition,
it
is desirable to have a CE marking for the reinforcement. Once a system
is
accepted by the Engineer-in-Charge shall not be changed during construction without the
prior approval of the Engineer-in-Charge.
RS Walls because of their superior flexibility offer better resistance in seismic zones. However
to ensure that there is no "falling of blocks", block facing can be used in zones where seismic
activity is high, typically Zone-!V and Zone V, as defined by IRC:6, with additional measures
like mechanical connection which shall transfer
1 00 percent load of long term design strength
in continuity, shear key, pins etc. to enhance the sliding resistance and resistance to falling
off. Use of block facing walls in a single rise beyond
1 0 m. should not be undertaken in these
zones. Such walls should be designed using a berm.
Connections of the panel/block with the reinforcement should be clearly defined and tested
using
relevant ASTM
standards. ASTM D-6916 and
D-6638,
gives
test procedures
for
evaluating block to block friction and block to reinforcement connection strength
(Fig.
5).
Results of these tests should be provided by the supplier.
The
connection
strength
between
the
reinforcing
element and
facing
shall
be
as
per
BS: 8006-2010.
It is once again reiterated that the connection strength and layout once used
in design calculations, shall not be changed during execution, unless approved by Engineer-
in-Charge. The method statement for construction of panels and blocks shall be approved
by the Engineer-in-Charge. Designers and construction personnel should note that, several
failures have occurred due
to improper connections and deviation from the connections
proposed in the approved designs.
In addition, the method of construction shall have quality assurance plan and tolerances as
specified by Clause 3106.6 of MORTH 2013 Specifications.

Reinforcement
Different types of reinforcennents used in reinforced soil walls are:-
Metallic elements like bars, strips, plates etc.
Metallic reinforcement in form of mesh
Polymeric elements like strips, grids, rods, mesh etc.
All types of Reinforcements are taken beyond the Rankine zone into the resistant zone to
ensure sufficient bond and anchorage.
Reinforcement
used
to
resist
lateral
loads
can
be
metallic
(typically
inextensible)
or
polymeric (typically extensible). Polymers are visco-elastic materials. Strength of polymeric
reinforcement
is therefore largely affected by temperature and time (creep). Evaluation of
strength should account for these two important factors. The tensile strength should be
evaluated by conducting a wide width tensile test (ISO 1 031 9 or ASTM D 6637or EN
1 0223-3
for woven steel wire mesh). Ail tests related to the reinforcement should be performed in an
independent accredited laboratory which is accredited by a competent authority.
11



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 80
======================================================================
IRC:SP:102-2014
Partial safety factors are used to arrive at the long term design strength. While accounting for
creep, design life of the adjoining super structure should be taken in to account. For example,
since all the elements of a bridge are designed for 100 years, the strength of the polymeric
reinforcement should also be estimated at the end of 100 years. Creep should be estimated
keeping
in mind the ambient temperature which
in many parts of the country exceeds 40°C
during summer, though in-situ temperatures may not exceed 30° - 35°C, that too for a short
period of the year. The designer shall provide partial safety factors for creep, for 20°, 30° and
40°C degrees. These results should also include creep rupture and creep strain
at these
temperatures.
Partial Safety factor used
in design should correspond to the temperature
calculated by the procedure given
in EN/ISO 20432. The design temperature should be
taken as halfway between the average yearly air temperature and normal daily temperature
(shade temperature) for the hottest month at the site. For obtaining the shade air temperature
in a zone as given by IRC-6 may be referred. Creep factors for different temperature should
be arrived at by conducting tests as per ISO 20432 in independent accredited laboratories.
Polymeric reinforcement shall have minimum of 10000 hours creep test data or SIM test data
at different temperatures to evaluate partial material factor for creep.
It is essential that SIM
test results be backed by few conventional tests taken to some limited hours.
Manufacturing of reinforcement should confirm to ISO 9001 standard, to ensure that quality
processes are stringently followed during manufacturing processes.
Long-term design strength of geosynthetic reinforcement should be determined in accordance
with ISO/TR 20432. The long-term design strength (LTD) of geosynthetic reinforcement
should be determined as:

Metallic reinforcement exhibits relatively negligible creep. The metallic reinforcement should
be coated with zinc to delay exposure and eventual corrosion. The zinc coating should confirm
to relevant BS/IS Code and in any case should not be less than 140 micron. In addition to the
zinc coating, sacrificial thickness of minimum 0.50 mm should be provided on all sides, while
designing. The zinc coated metal reinforcement shall be free of holidays and shall be subject
to 100 percent inspection, since holidays can accelerate corrosion due to galvanic effect.
Care shall be exercised during compaction of granular
fill with zinc coated metal strips to
ensure the integrity of the coating. Metallic reinforcement should be manufactured in a facility
having ISO certification. Metallic elements and fasteners connections should be coated by
zinc coating of 80 micron.

3.6
Traffic Barriers
Traffic barriers (Crasli barriers) are constructed over the front face of the reinforced walls.
Commonly, a friction slab
is used to transfer the lateral loads due to impact of vehicles on
the Barriers. Typically a friction slab varies from 1500 to 2500 mm width and 250 mm thick
depending on the type of crash barrier provided. One aspect to be taken care of is the 'Friction
slab'
in the approach embankments.
Unlike the approach slab which extends throughout
the width of the embankments, the friction slab width depends upon the design adequacy
extending only for the part of the embankment width.
It is necessary to make detailed design
for the friction slab taking care of adequate factor of safety against sliding, overturning etc. in
addition to the structural design of crash barrier.
If the barrier is placed without a shoulder the lateral force due to the impact of a vehicle would
be transferred to the upper layer of the reinforcement. The barrier should be designed for an
impact force as stipulated by the IRC Codes/guidelines. The impact force resulting due to
the impact shall be distributed equally to the upper two rows of the soil reinforcement, which
the reinforcements resist over their full length.
It should be structurally sized to resist at least
3 tonnes per metre. A typical arrangement of a crash barrier without a shoulder is shown in
Fig. 6. Designers should note that there have been several cases of failure of RS Walls due
to improper design, detailing and construction of Traffic/Crash barriers. Friction slab shall be
designed in a manner consistent with the type of crash barrier provided.

4 QUALITY CONTROL TESTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
The different components that go to make up a RS Wall need to be chosen carefully after
carrying out appropriate tests. Besides the quality control tests should be also undertaken
with stringent control with reference to the tests and their frequency.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 80
======================================================================
IRC:SP:102-2014
Before proceeding with the design of RS Walls, adequate geotechnica! exploration should be
carried out to ensure that the all necessary soil properties required for design of the wall are
available. 1RC:78 may referred for details of extent and depth of exploration.
The feasibility of using earth retaining system depends on the existing topography, subsurface
conditions, and soil/rock properties
It is necessary to perform a comprehensive subsurface
exploration to evaluate site stability, likely settlement, need for drainage, etc., before designing
a new retaining wall.
Subsurface
investigations are required
not only
in the area
of the construction
but also
behind and in front of the structure to assess overall performance behaviour. The subsurface
investigation shall enable study of conditions that prevail throughout the construction of the
structure, such as the stability of construction.
4.1
Tests for Resnforcement
The reinforcement is chosen on the basis of the test results provided by the supplier. Such
tests are referred as "index Tests". All tests should have been conducted in an independent
accredited
laboratory. The
laboratoi^/tests
should
have
received
accreditation
from
a
competent authority. Tensile test results furnished by the manufacturer should be recent,
i.e.
tests conducted less than a year old, before proof checking and
fit for construction approval
is accorded.
Tests should include Tensile tests, (Stress strain graph), creep test results, tests to determine
resistance to mechanical and environmental damage, raw material used and other properties
characterising the reinforcement e.g. Aperture size, wt./sq.m. etc.
The tests performed to evaluate the in-situ/life time performance like resistance to installation
damage,
environmental damage,
creep,
type
of raw
material,
carboxyl end group and
molecular weight, should be also provided by the supplier. Creep test results for 20°, 30° and
40°C should be provided. The testing should also include tests to evaluate block to block and
block to reinforcement testing as specified by ASTM tests mentioned
earlier. The supplier
should also clearly indicate the methodology of identifying the reinforcement vis-a-vis
its
strength in the field.
Certification/test report for long-term creep shall state the reinforcement products in their final
configuration (finished product); creep test run on the raw material (resin/yarn) used
in the
manufacture of the geosynthetic material shall not to be considered as representative of the
finished product. The manufacturer shall give a Declaration of Conformity (DoC) stating that
the products
supplied for a project fully comply with the product that were tested for creep
and for which the creep test report/certification are submitted.
Polyester geosynthetics shall have molecular weight greater than or equal to 25000 g/mol
and carboxyl end groups less than or equal to 30 mmol/Kg. Manufacturer shall furnish test
results of these parameters and sign a declaration that the same raw material is used in the
finished product.
Once the design is approved the reinforcement arriving at the site should be tested for tensile
strength, in an independent accredited laboratory, at frequency of 1 set per 5000 sq. m. of wall
facia area or two sets of samples whichever
is higher. Samples should be drawn randomly
from the reinforcement at site in presence of the user or his representative.
14

Metallic reinforcement should confirm to Clause 3103 of MORTH 2013 Specifications.
4.2
Tests for Reinforced and Retained Fill
The
soil which
is proposed
to be used as reinforced
fill
shaii be tested
to ascertain the
suitability for required quantity, grading, type and availability of required quantity etc.
The soil to be used as retained
fill behind the reinforced
fill,
in case
it is not natural soil, shall
be tested for its shear characteristics and permeability to evaluate earth pressure, drainage
characteristics etc. for external stability of the wall.
The backfill is tested at two stages. The first stage is to ascertain the suitability of the fill while the
second stage to ensure that the backfill envisaged in design
is used during construction.
To ascertain the
suitability of the
fill, samples should be drawn from the borrow area by
drawing a grid of 25 m c/c to full depth, logging and sampling for ascertaining suitability of
the borrow material as per MORTH 2013 Specifications. Following tests shall be carried out
as per Indian Standards.
i)
Sieve Analysis - IS: 2720 Part - 2 tests per 3000 cu.m. of soil
ii)
Atterberg Limit Tests- IS: 2720 Part- 5-2 tests per 3000 cu.m. of soil
iii)
Compaction Tests - IS: 2720 relevant part corresponding to modified as well
as Standard Proctor test - 2 tests per 3000 cu.m. of soil
iv)
Direct Shear Tests - IS: 2720 Part 13 & 39 to ascertain the peak angle of
shearing resistance. The tests should be done at 95 percent of Modified
Proctor Density at -2 percent of OMC at a frequency of
1 per 3000 cu.m. of
fill
During construction the quality control should be exercised by conducting one set of density
test of 3000 sq.m. of compacted area considering the importance of compaction in reinforced
soil walls. (Clause 903.2.2 of MORTH 201 3) One set shall consist of 6 tests. The density tests
shall be carried out
in accordance with IS-2720 Part 28. Density measurement by nuclear
gauge may be carried out as an alternative. For such a test the number of tests per set shall
be doubled.
If the retained
fill
is borrowed tests mentioned above should be carried out at
same frequency of reinforced
fill. Frequency during construction shall be as per MORTH
2013 Specifications.
4.3
iVIaterials for Concrete
Materials used for making concrete blocks and panels shall be as per specification and tests
as specified in IRC: 11 2.
5 DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Limit state principles are used in design of Reinforced Soil Walls. Two limit states considered
in design are:
a)
Ultimate limit state (collapse loads)
b)
Serviceability
limit state (ensuring that deformations are within prescribed
limits).
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 80
======================================================================
IRC:SP:102-2014
Limit state design for reinforced soil walls uses partial safety factors applied to imposed loads,
materials used and overall safety factor to include the consequences of failure.
In the limit
state approach, disturbing loads are increased by multiplying specified load factors to arrive
at design load, while resisting forces are reduced by dividing by the specified materia! factors
to arrive at the design strengths.
In addition, for Reinforced Soil walls, a partial safety factor,
f^ is used to account for consequences of failure, frequency of occurrence of loads etc., while
considering the ultimate
limit state, various potential
failure mechanisms are considered.
Internal and external stability is considered for different potential failure mechanisms.
In addition to normal principles of design on the basis of which earth retaining structures are
designed, consideration has to be given to soil/reinforcement interaction while designing
Reinforced soil structures.
Analysis is done in two distinct parts External Stability and Internal Stability.
External stability deals with stability of the reinforced block as a unit, while internal stability deals
with mechanisms of transfer of lateral pressures to reinforcement and related mechanisms
involved.
Once the design loads
(serviceability load
,
or working
load) are carried by the metallic
reinforcement such as bars, plates etc. at an axial strain less than the strain
in the soil, the
reinforcement is classified as "inextensible" reinforcement. Polymeric reinforcements which
are characterised by temperature and time dependent strains (creep) are normally classified
as extensible reinforcements. However, Polymeric and other reinforcements which show less
strain as compared to soil strain may be also classified as inextensible reinforcement.
Normally, when the design load
is sustained
at a
total
axial
strain
1
percent or less the
reinforcement is classified as inextensible (BS-8006).Where the design load
is sustained at
total axial tensile strain exceeding
1 percent the reinforcement is classified as extensible.
The onus of categorising the reinforcement as extensible or inextensible, based on one of
the above mentioned approach, will entirely
lie on the supplier. The supplier should provide
tensile test results from an independent accredited laboratory/certifying agency
in support.
The test to classify the reinforcement needs to be done only at the design stage. Such a test
need not be repeated with local soil. Alternatively, full scale instrumented test results can be
accepted to classify the reinforcement.
Two methods are commonly used for analysing the internal
stability of the reinforced
soil
structures. The
"tie back wedge method" follows
principles used
in
classical analysis of
anchored retaining walls. The "coherent gravity method" is based on monitored and observed
behaviour
of
reinforced
structures
using
inextensible
reinforcement.
For
inextensible
reinforcements,
lateral pressures are estimated using
i.e. earth pressure at rest at top
and shall be linearly tapered to active earth pressure coefficient
at 6m (height measured
from top) and below, while when extensible reinforcement is used, active pressure should be
considered in design throughout the height of the wall.
Limit state approach using partial safety factors is used for design of reinforced soil structures
and structural elements also.

IRC:SP:102-2014
5.1
External Stability
RS Walls with uniform slope have been successfully constructed
in India upto heights 20 m
using polymeric reinforcements as well as metallic reinforcements. For heights exceeding
15 m the walls should be designed with a berm/step at an intermediate height,
if polymeric
reinforcements are used.
External stability of the reinforced soil mass/block is checked for three different conditions:-
a)
Bearing and
tilt failure:- Bearing pressure exerted by the reinforced
soil
mass on the founding strata should be such that there
is sufficient margin
against failure. The design should achieve a Factor of Safety of at least 1 .4 in
the limit state, after considering eccentricity and resultant pressures.
It should
be also ensured that the eccentricity is less than L/6 to avoid development of
tension. Passive pressure in front of the wall should not be considered in the
stability calculations. Minimum depth of embedment shall be 600 mm or H/20
whichever is more.
It should be noted that H is the mechanical height, which
is the vertical distance measured from the inner edge of the wall to the mid-
height of the road crust. While constructing retaining walls on existing roads,
especially concrete roads, the requirement of minimum embedment depth
of 600 mm may be relaxed to 400 mm, provided precautions are taken to
ensure that the front of the wall is protected from excavation post-construction
and sufficient resistance is available to prevent sliding. Arrangement shown
in Annexure AO, which uses a beam and anchor rods
at the toe of the
wall, can be adopted to ensure adequate lateral resistance towards sliding.
Where the bearing capacity
is not adequate, suitable ground improvement
measures need to be undertaken. After construction of walls excavation
in
front of the walls should be
strictly prohibited as
it
is
likely to reduce the
stability of the wall. Annexure A1 gives a summary of ground improvement
measures commonly used. The purpose of giving brief information of ground
improvement methods
is
to
highlight methods beyond
the
conventional
approaches which are overlooked by designers.
b)
Sliding and overturning:- Factor of Safety towards sliding and overturning
due to lateral pressures imposed should be adequate. FS of at least 1.2
in
the limit state should be achieved.
c)
Global stability:- FS against a slip circle failure should be checked. FS of at
least
1 .30 under static conditions and 1.10 under dynamic/earthquake loads
should be ensured considering un-factored load. The analysis should also
check possible failure modes included the possibility of deep seated failure.
The global
stability analysis
shall be carried out using standard software
having capability of modelling reinforcement, different geometries of the wall
and failure modes.

of reinforcement will be summation of lateral pressure arising due to self-weight of
the
fill, surcharge caused by external loading, strip loading applied on the top of
the
fill and shear applied at the contact of the strip loading. Figs. 9A and 9B show
the different forces to be taken in to design. Tensile force/m running length can be
calculated using the expression given below:-
.
T = K3aA + KA(F,S,/B,) + 2S/,F,Q(1-hp)
Eqn.
...

where,
-
Kg is the active earth pressure coefficient, taken as (1
- sin cD)/(1 + sin O)
For a
sloping surcharge and
wall Ka may be estimated
using
the
following
equation
Kg = {(Sin2(a + 0))/[sin2a * (sin (a - 5) [1+ (Vsin (0) + 5) * sin (<D - P) )/(sin (a + (S))]^}
where,
a is the wall face makes with the horizontal
P is the slope makes with the horizontal
O is the angle of internal friction
6 friction angle between the soil and the wall which can be taken as 0.67*cj)
Q^. is the factored vertical stress at the
i*^ level of reinforcement after considering Meyerhofs
distribution
i.e. eccentricity. A distribution of 2v:1h should be considered for evaluation of the
vertical stress due to strip load only.
Note:
a^ = R/(L-2e).
S^. is the vertical spacing of reinforcement at the
i'^ level of reinforcement
is the partial load factor for applied concentrated loads (1.2 for combination A)
is the strip loading applied on a contact area of width b
d is the distance from the inner face of the wall to the centre of the strip load
h. is the distance to the top of the
i**" layer
B. can be taken as (h. + b)
if h. < (2d
- b) or (h. + b )/2 + d
if h. > (2d
- b)
F|^ Horizontal shear force applied to the contact of the loaded area
Q is given by the expression tan (45 - 0/2) /
( d + b/2)
Reduction
in
lateral pressure and tension, due to cohesion
is not to be considered and
neglected since cohesion may be lost under certain conditions.
The resistance of the
i*^ layer should be checked for rupture and adherence.
In addition to
the above checks the wedge stability of the mass above the
i'^ layer should be also checked.

Wedge stability
is ensured when friction forces acting on a potential failure plane and the
tensile resistance offered by the reinforcement are able to
resist loads tending to cause
movements.
Annexure A2 gives the design details for Rupture, Adherence and Wedge stability checks.
These checks will also ensure that the length of the reinforcement in the resistant zone
is
adequate.

Maximum Tension
line for a coherent gravity structure can be approximated as shown
in
Fig. 12. This is commonly referred as Tension line 2. When a structure is subjected to strip load
another tension line needs to be considered. This line is called as tension line
1 (BS-8006).
Tension line
1
is defined in Fig. 13. The tension in the reinforcement should be calculated for
three positions i.e. at the facing, along tension line

a^ while other components would remain unchanged. The value of a^ may be taken as
0.85 for h. < (1 .5

For the tensile force along tension line

a constant a^ while the other components would remain unchanged. The value of a^ may be
taken as
1 for K < b

For Tension force along tension line 2 equation 2 should be used.
The resistance of the
i*^ layer should be checked for rupture and adherence.
In addition to
the above checks the wedge stability of the mass above the
i'^ layer should be also checked.
Wedge stability
is ensured when friction forces acting on a potential failure plane and the
tensile resistance offered by the reinforcement are able to
resist loads tending to cause
movements.
For both the methods described above global stability checks should be carried out in addition
to local stability checks.

H ~ design height of the RS Retaining Wall. The design height should be calculated as depth
of embedment plus the height above the ground level.
Some reinforced soil walls use a passive block at the end of the reinforcement to derive the
benefit of the passive resistance in resisting the tension. Full passive resistance should not be
taken in design since the strain required to mobilise the passive force is large. Such a strain
level can be only attained when the deformation
in the RS Walls
is beyond the permissible
level. The design calculations may only include 20 percent of the passive resistance.

5.4
Serviceability and Settlements
Settlement of the founding
soil and the compression
of the
reinforced mass
contribute
towards the total settlement of a reinforced
soil structure. Settlement of the founding
soil
can be estimated by conventional theories. Post construction settlement of the founding soil
should not exceed 100 mm for discrete panels/and blocks which result in flexible structures.
Settlements arising due to internal compression are normally small once compaction is done
effectively. However the facing should be able to cope up with the internal compression.
Typical safe vertical movements the fascia should resist should be taken as
1
in 150. Total
settlement can
affect functionality
in a specific manner,
differential settlements produces
severe effects on the completed structure (although reinforced
soil mass
is known to be
more accommodative as far as differential settlements are concerned), Typically differential
settlement of
1
in 100 are considered as safe for discrete concrete panels facings (1
in 500
for full height panels).
5.4.1
Construction tolerances and serviceability
Reinforced
soil
structures deform during
construction
if proper care
is
not taken during
compaction and erection. Due consideration should be given to ensure that during construction
and post construction deformations and strains are within limits. Reinforced structures.
1)
Should be visually acceptable, free of bulges and erratic alignments.
ii)
should follow smooth curves.
iii)
wall faces should
not deform
to cause spalling/cracking
of face
panel/s,
closing/opening of joints.
Specifications outlined
in section 3106.6 of MORTH~2013 document shall be referred for
construction and serviceability tolerances, dimensional tolerances of panels and blocks.
5.5
Spacing and Layoyt of Reinforcement in Reinforced Soil WaSfs
The spacing of reinforcement shall be established based on the design principles. However,
in the actual layout of reinforcing elements, the following shall be adhered to as provided
Clause A2 in the MORTH-201 3 guidelines.
i)
To provide a coherent reinforced
soil mass, the vertical spacing of primary
reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm,
in all types of reinforcement.

ii)
For walls constructed with modular blocks and
deriving
their connection
capacity by
friction, and
also
for any
other
facia
configurations, where
connection
capacity
is
by
friction,
the
maximum
vertical
spacing
of
reinforcement shall be two times the block width (measured from front fact to
back face of the block). Further, the maximum spacing of reinforcing elements
shall not exceed 800 mm in all cases.
The maximum height effacing left unreinforced
a)
above the uppermost reinforcing layer and
b)
below the lowest reinforcing
layer,
shall not exceed the width of the
block (measured from the front face to back face of the block.)
ill)
In case modular blocks are used for facia, no more than one intervening
block shall be left without having primary reinforcement.
iv)
In case of wraparound facings for walls, the maximum spacing of reinforcing
elements shall not exceed 500 mm, to protect against bulging.
v)
Where panels are used, the maximum spacing of reinforcement shall not
exceed 800 mm. The spacing of nearest reinforcing element shall be such
that maximum height of facing above uppermost reinforcement layer and
below the lower most reinforcement layer does not exceed 400 mm.
vi)
Reinforcement spacing worked out from the design procedures
shall be
configured to fit the above parameters.
Whereas the role of the primary reinforcement is to carry the tensile forces in the reinforced fill,
secondary reinforcement may be required to protect the slope face from local sloughing and
instability depending upon the facia configuration adopted. Where secondary reinforcement
is used, stability of the area near the slope face shall be checked separately.
Where metallic type facia elements are used, the lower part of the facia element may be
extended into the
fill to serve as a secondary reinforcement. In other types of facia, geogrids
may also be used as a secondary reinforcement. The length of the secondary reinforcement
shall be adequate to provide local stability in the vicinity of the slope face.
6 CONSTRUCTION OF RS WALLS
The performance of the RS structure hinges not only on design but to a larger extent on the
care and accuracy to which the construction
is carried out. Construction of Reinforced soil
structures should be therefore given due importance especially since
it involves layer wise
construction. The responsibility of the construction of a RS Wall will solely lies with the main
contractor. Steps involved in construction are described below in the following section.
A)
Placing and fixing of reinforcement and facing elements with backfill
1)
Foundation treatment,
if required,
shall be
first completed
to ensure that
design parameters are attained.
It should be noted that use of RS Wall
structures does not imply that "no foundation treatment is required."

2)
The
plan
of the
structure
shall be marked on ground as
per approved
drawings.
3)
Excavate and compact
the
base
the ground
to
the embedment depth
and required width, to a dry density of 95 percent of the Modified Proctor
Density.
4)
The trench shall be backfilled using reinforced fill, levelled and well compacted
to achieve 95 percent Modified Proctor Maximum Dry Density.
5)
An
initial levelling pad of 150 mm thick using (minimum) M15 plain cement
concrete having suitable width
to be placed below the
first row of fascia
layer.
6)
The first layer of face block or element on the base and level envisaged
in
the drawing.
7)
The alignment of the
block/facing element must be checked
regularly to
make sure the wall
is straight or curve as per drawing.
8)
The required thickness of drainage material shall be placed at the back facing
block/panel and in the hollows effacing block. The drainage material shall be
compacted with vibratory plate compactor and within the block cavities. No
heavy compaction equipment should be allowed to operate within 1.5 m of
the back of face panel.
9)
Placing the reinforced soil backfill behind the drainage zone and compacting
to a minimum of 95 percent Modified Proctor density/80 percent Relative
Density. The
backfill
should
be
placed
and
compacted
in
layers. The
compacted thickness of each layer shall not exceed 200 mm. At no stage
of construction the compaction or any other equipment shall be allowed to
operate directly on the reinforcement.
10)
When
in direct contact, the backfill material and the drainage material shall
be separated using permeable non-woven geotextile.
11)
The successive face element
shall be
placed
as
per
required
line and
level.
In
several
cases outward movement has been
observed due
to
poor connection
of reinforcement with face element.
Provisions given
in
Section 3.4 should be followed for details of connections. The same procedure
shall be repeated until the final layer of reinforcement is reached.
12)
Before placing the drainage material and
backfill, the reinforcement should
be cut to length and placed on top of the face block. The reinforcement should
be stretched to ensure that there are no wrinkles and the reinforcement
is
taut.
1 3)
Care should be taken to ensure that geogrid is slightly away from the external
junction of outside face of fascia block. This will ensure that the geogrid does
not protrude out of the wall and
is prevented from UV ray exposure.
14)
Second
layer of facia
block
is
laid over the geogrid, so
that geogrid
is
completely interlocked between the blocks. The above procedure is repeated
for subsequent geogrid layers.

1 5)
Where panels are used, the reinforcement should be connected to connector
embedded
in
the
panel.
The
connection
envisaged
should
be
clearly
indicated in the approved design and outlined in the "good/fit for construction
drawings". At no stage of construction the details envisaged in design should
be changed.
1 6)
When panels are used
it is desirable to keep an initial inward better.
It should
be in accordance with MoRTH 31 06.3 which states that
it may be necessary
to set facing
unit at an additional batter than as provided
in the drawings
since there is a tendency for initially positioned units of facia to lean outward
as the
fill materia! is placed and compacted. Care and caution shall be taken
'
-
to accommodate this phenomenon. At the end of the construction, the face
may have a slight residual inward batter.
17)
Where the retained
fill
is borrowed and
is different from the reinforced
fill the
construction should progress simultaneously.
It is desirable that face of the blocks be profiled to have an inward batter of 2-4 degrees.
7 COMMON CAUSES OF FAILURE OF RETAINING WALLS
Design and
construction
of Reinforced
Soil
walls
is an
involved
process
requiring due
diligence and quality control. Moreover, repairs and remedial are often laborious, difficult, time
consuming, expensive, often ineffective in the long run and
in most of the cases impossible
to implement. The designer and the owner should therefore be cautioned that while there are
several advantages of using RS Walls these are not realised unless careful consideration
is
given to design as well as construction procedures. Failures can be in serviceability as well
as collapse.
Common causes of distress and/or failures are summarised below.

GROUND IMPROVEMENT METHODS FOR ENHANCING BEARING
CAPACITY AND STABILITY
A1.1
CohesionSess Soils
Common methods of improving deep cohesionless soils are:
'
'
a)
Heavy Tamping-
It
is the most economical way in which the ground can be
improved up to a substantial depth, of say 15.00 m. The method consists
of dropping a weight W through a distance H, thus imparting an energy of
W*H per blow. The entire area can be covered by this method to improve the
ground to desired shear strength.
Initial trials need to be carried out to prove
the efficacy of the method and also to fine tune the coverage of the entire
.
area. This method should be only used
in areas where resulting vibrations
do not affect the utilities, underground structures and buildings. This method
should not be considered in urban settings.
b)
Blasting - Igniting a charge in a borehole to cause initial liquefaction and /or
change
in volume thus causing the soil to settle to a new compact relative
density. This method can be adopted only when resulting vibrations do not
affect structures and utilities. Therefore, this method should not be considered
in urban areas or areas where utilities and underground structures are likely
to be affected.
c)
Vibrofloatation - A patented method where a "vibrofloat" compacts the soil by
vibrations and the resulting column
is filled with gravel.
d)
In case the improvement is not required up to a substantial depth, replacing
the soil or excavating the soil and backfilling
it with reinforcement (commonly
bi-axial geo-grids) would enhance the bearing capacity. Since the precise
distribution of forces
is not fully understood,
it is recommended that, where
possible, the maximum limit state tensile force T should be provided
in one
reinforcement layer. The reinforcement be restricted to a maximum 2 layers.
Theenhancementin Bearing Capacity can bejudged by estimatingthe Bearing
Capacity Ratio (BCR)/Pressure Ratio (p^) which is defined Bearing Capacity
in reinforced soil to that in the unreinforced soil at the same settlement. The
tensile strength of the reinforcement can be calculated once the required
BCR and the location of the reinforcement and the number of layers are
known.
It is not advisable to use this method of ground improvement for deep
cohesive soils.

e)
Use
of Geocells
to improve the Bearing Capacity
of both cohesive and
cohesionless soils.
i)
Geocells
are three dimensional,
axisymmetric,
interconnected
cells
made up of geosynthetics that are used to improve the properties of
base courses by providing lateral confinement to increase the strength
and
stiffness and reduce permanent surface deformation.
Geocells
are filled with soil/granular material or appropriately graded, forming a
mattress for increased bearing capacity and manoeuvrability on loose
or compressible subsoil.
ii)
Geocells are placed directly on the subsoil surface and propped open
in an accordion-like manner. The opened honeycomb-like spaces are
filled with cohesionless material and compacted using vibratory hand-
operated plate compactors.
iii)
In terms of design, geocell systems mechanics are quite complex to
assess. One can estimate the enhancement in Bearing Capacity using
approaches cited in the literature.
iv)
Empirical equations are available to assess the efficacy of the geocell
mattresses.
v)
Geocell
mattresses
are formed
by
adopting
different
construction
techniques. Such mattresses are also referred to as Basal mattresess.
This method can be used where ground improvement
is required for
shallow depths say upto
1 .00 to
1 .50 m.
f)
In case the improvement is not required upto a substantial depth, replacing
the soil or excavating the soil and backfilling
it with reinforcement (commonly
bi-axial geo-grids) would enhance the bearing capacity. Such reinforcement
can be used
in
2-3
layers
upto a depth
of about
1.00
to 2.00 m. The
enhancement in Bearing Capacity can be judged by estimating the Bearing
Capacity Ratio (BCR) which
is defined Bearing Capacity in reinforced soil to
that in the unreinforced soil. The tensile strength of the reinforcement can be
calculated once the required BCR and the location of the reinforcement
is
known.
It is not advisable to use this method of ground improvement for deep
cohesive soils.

SEISMIC FORCES TO BE CONSIDERED IN EXTERNAL & INTERNAL STABILITY

This annexure of the guidelines provide for seismic analysis of RE wall as provided by
FHWA-NHI-00-043 approach. Designer can adopt seismic analysis as per AFNOR and other
FHWA guidelines as an alternative. As reinforced earth wall
is more flexible compared to
a
relatively
rigid R.C.C
retaining wall the
inertial
effects due to horizontal acceleration
is
considered on part of reinforced volume of earth and vertical acceleration is neglected. Also
only 50 percent of dynamic increment on the earth pressure of retained
fill is considered. No
dynamic increment on earth pressure due to live load surcharge is considered unlike gravity
type retaining walls. Salient features of seismic analysis are as under.
Peak horizontal acceleration
is selected based on the seismic zone (design earthquake)

block as detailed for static/dynamic analysis of normal retaining wall. Inclined slope
is not
supposed to have live load surcharge and will need no consideration.
A3.1
Internal Stability
The internal stability shall be analyzed as follows:
Internal failure can occur mainly in two ways.
•
Failure by excessive elongation or breakage of tensile element
•
Failure by pull-out of tensile element
The following steps are needed for analyzing internal stability -
1)
Selection of type of reinforcement
2)
Location of critical failure surface
3)
Maximum tensile force at each reinforcement level, static and dynamic
4)
Maximum tensile force at the connection to the facing
5)
Pull-out capacity at each reinforcement level
Based on research and experiments the critical failure surface has been established to depend
on type of reinforcements whether the same is extensible or inextensible. Figs. A3. 3(a) and
A3.3(b) shows these two cases giving relevant details. The maximum tensile forces T^^^ in
the element occurs along the line shown
in Figs. A3.3 (a) & A3.3 (b). The anchorage and
strength (shear and bending) of the face panel are also required to withstand the forces to
which these are subjected to from the earth pressure of the backfill.
The failure of tensile element by rupture can take place at the maximum tensile stress point
and solely is a function of its tensile strength. The tensile force is a function of earth pressure
due to self-weight of earth above the element and other super imposed loads, may be live
or dead
load, and
coefficient of earth pressure. The
pull out resistance depends on the
embedment length of tensile element beyond the failure line (effective length), the inter face
friction coefficient and the vertical loads (resultant pressure, of all loads above the level of
element). The first step
is evaluation of T^^^
in the tensile element at particular level. Then
the strength of the element after allowing for various reduction factors
is checked whether
the same can safely withstand T
. Then the pullout resistance of the tensile element in the
'
max
"
resistant zone is evaluated to check whether the element can withstand T^^^ without getting
pulled out. The FoS
is also evaluated against strength of reinforcement as well as pullout
resistance. Thus internal stability of the wall at this level of reinforcement is ensured. Similar
checking
is done at levels of all the tensile elements to ensure safety of the R.E Wall. These
steps are mentioned in Para A3.1 .1
, A3.1 .2 & A3.1 .3.
A3.1 .1
Calculation of Maximum Tensile forces in the Reinforcement Layers
At each reinforcement level the horizontal stress
along the potential failure line from the
weight of the reinforced
fill
Z (Z = elevation of reinforcement) plus uniform surcharge load
q is obtained as
o, = Ka
(Eqn.A3.10)

PAGE 51 of 80

IRC:SP:102-2014
Where,
= y^Z + q,
= Active Earth Pressure Coefficient. The horizontal stress is multiplied
by the area of the wall affecting the reinforcement known as tributary area
and this leads
to Tmax
T™. = <^hA,
(Eqn.3.11)
Kg should be evaluated for extensible and inextensible reinforcement based on the approach
given in Section 5.2
A3.1 .2
Internal stability with respect to rupture (breakage of reinforcement)
The allowable reinforcement strength
is obtained from
its ultimate strength after allowing for
various reduction factors and applying a factor of safety. For wall to be safe against rupture
of reinforcement the allowable strength
is required to be more than T^^^ at the level of the
reinforcement then
(Eqn.A3.12)
where, RF^
is durability reduction factor, Rf^^ is reduction factor due to installation damage,
RF^ is the reduction factor due to creep and coverage ratio R^ = b/S^, with b the gross width of
reinforcing element and S^ is the center-to-center horizontal spacing between reinforcements
(in case of Geogrids R^ =
1 ).
A3. 1.3
Internal Stability with respect to pull-out failure:
The tensile element to be safe against pull out the following criteria is satisfied.

If the criterion

or the vertical spacing may be reduced which would reduce T^^^.
The total length of reinforcement, L, required for internal stability is determined from.

load and
the reinforcement strength needed to resist the dynamic or transient component

RS WALL OF COMPLEX GEOMETRICS
1.
Broken Slope
This geometry
is regarding change
in slope of back
fill near the RE Wall. Two situations
can arise at site depending on the distance from the wall where the slope changes. Where,
however, the change in slope takes place beyond 2H (Height of the wall) all computation of earth
pressure co-efficient etc. shall be done taking surcharge slope without any modification.
There could be two situations, first where the slope changes within the length of reinforcement
and second where the slope changes beyond the reinforcement length but before 2H distance
from the wall. Both these cases are covered in following sketches. In both cases the surcharge
angle (p)
is required to be modified by angle
(I) and
all computation of earth pressure co-
efficient etc. are done using modified surcharge angle. Rest of the computation
is same as
for wall without broken slope.

Back to Back Wall
The back to back wall are those which are near each other such that the reinforced portion of
wall come within the active failure wedge which might form beyond the reinforced soil volume.
As the walls comes closer the earth pressure by the back fill on the reinforce block decreases
and at a point when the reinforcing element of the two wall overlap by O.3H2 (where H2 is the
height of the shorter wall) the earth pressure becomes zero. In a position where the wall is at
a distance such that D >
tan(45°-(j)/2) where there
is no interference of active wedge with
the reinforced volume, they will behave as independent walls and stability shall be obtained
accordingly.
In between these two positions the earth pressure shall be linearly interpolated
for analyzing sliding and over-turning.
The sketches given below show these situations.

Superimposed Walls
Total height of embankment can be covered by providing stepped RE Wall each covering one
part of height. Such arrangement

Wall may fall in following categories depending on offsets.

H2 tan (45° - y) < D < H2 tan (90° -(t)r). The wall internal stability tensile force
lines are as indicated in figure and vertical pressure as given in Fig. 4.8.
These relationships are somewhat empirical and geometrically derived.
The global
stability of the system
(slip
circle
failure through
backfill) has
to be checked
considering all the walls in different tires together for all cases covered by
(i),
(ii),
(iii) and (iv)
above. The upper wall
is considered as a surcharge for the lower wall
in computing bearing
pressure. For location of the failure line Figs. 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 are referred.
The
