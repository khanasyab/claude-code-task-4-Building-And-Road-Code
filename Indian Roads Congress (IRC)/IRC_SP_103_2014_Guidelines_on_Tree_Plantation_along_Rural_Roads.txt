Guidelines  On  Tree  Plantation   
Along   
Rural  Roads
Introduction
The Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree Plantation, First Revision (IRC:SP:21-2009) 
published in November 2009 provides comprehensive guidance on landscaping and roadside 
arboriculture along highways. The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government 
of India requested that the Indian Roads Congress may consider bringing out a special 
publication on plantation of trees along rural roads as the focus of the current publication 
appears to be more towards roads of higher categories.
In view of the urgency expressed on this requirement, the Ministry of Rural Development set 
up a small group comprising a few domain experts from the forest sector to provide inputs to 
the IRC for consideration. (List of Members at Appendix-I).
It was decided to have the Guidelines for Tree Plantation along Rural Roads formulated by 
the Rural Roads Committee (H-5) keeping in view the already published document of the IRC 
on the subject and the special inputs of the Group constituted by the MoRD.
The draft of the said Guidelines was prepared by a small group comprising Shri N.C. Solanki, 
Director (Projects-I), NRRDA and Member-Secretary, H-5 Committee; Dr. I.K. Pateriya, 
Director (Technical), NRRDA and Member H-5 Committee; Dr. B. Mukhopadhyay, Deputy 
General Manager (NHAI) and Members of the group constituted by the MoRD.
The draft was discussed by the H-5 Committee during its meeting held on 1st August, 2014. 
The Committee deliberated over the draft and approved it with some suggestions. The 
Convenor was authorised to modify the same by suitably incorporating the suggestions made 
in the meeting.

The draft finalized by the Rural Roads Committee was discussed by the Highways 
Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 9th August, 2014. The 
document finalized by the HSS Committee was approved by the Executive Committee in 
its meeting held on 18th August, 2014. The IRC Council in its meeting held at New Delhi on 
19th August, 2014 approved the draft IRC:SP:103-2014 “Guidelines on Tree Plantation along 
Rural Roads” for publishing.
1  SCOPE
1.1	
India is witnessing a major development of road infrastructure to catalyse its 
socio-economic development. In order to give a boost to rural connectivity, a Rural Roads 
Programme known as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched 
in December, 2000. Another programme known as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural 
Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is being implemented as a rights-based, demand-
driven and self-selecting scheme with a view to enhance livelihood security to rural 
households. Some roads are being built under this programme. Side by side, several States 
have taken up the construction and improvement of rural roads to all-weather standards to 
provide connectivity to lower size habitations not covered under the PMGSY eligibility criteria. 
Roadside plantation will check deterioration of roads and will contribute to strengthening 
ecological balance and reducing global warming.
1.2	
The Indian Roads Congress (IRC) brought out a document entitled “Guidelines on 
Landscaping and Tree Plantation” (First Revision) in the year 2009 as a special publication, 
IRC:SP:21-2009. This document provides guidelines for plantation of trees and strategies 
for landscaping along highways. This is serving as a very useful guide to the road agencies 
particularly dealing with main roads (National Highways, State Highways, Major District 
Roads) and roads in urban areas. It also covers guidelines on selection of tree species in 
different areas of the country but lacks focus on guidance for rural roads. It is, therefore, felt 



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 45
======================================================================

IRC:SP:103-2014
3
that a separate document on the Guidelines for Plantation of Trees along Rural Roads may 
be prepared that would provide guidance to the road agencies that are implementing the 
PMGSY and other rural roads programmes in the country. This document has been prepared 
and finalized accordingly.
1.3	
It needs to be pointed out that unlike main roads, the rural roads being upgraded 
or constructed under the various programmes rely mostly on voluntary donation of land by 
the local communities. As such, there could be situations where the available Right-of-Way 
is not sufficient enough to accommodate any tree plantation.
1.4	
It is not possible to lay down rigid and uniform standards for tree plantation along 
rural roads, as the plantation scheme to be adopted may vary from place to place depending 
upon the topography, climate and other environmental features. As such, this document 
lays down broad guidelines subject to such modifications as may be governed by local site 
conditions. It would be productive and useful, if the road agencies keep in contact with the 
departments dealing with Forest and Agriculture for seeking their advice as to the selection 
of species and methods of plantation.
1.5	
These guidelines are divided into seven sections to focus attention on different 
aspects of plantation relevant to rural roads, types of species, spacing of plantations, 
maintenance, bio-engineering measures for slope protection duly drawing reference to 
the material already contained in the Special Publication IRC:SP:21-2009 and MoRD 
Specifications for Rural Roads, First Revision (2014).
2  IMPORTANT  ASPECTS  IN  RESPECT  OF  RURAL  ROADS
2.1	
The plantation of trees along rural roads is to be confined to the available Right-
of-Way. No attempt should be made to acquire additional land for the purpose of tree 
plantation.
2.2	
In view of the limited space likely to be available along the PMGSY and other 
rural roads, only single row of plants would generally be provided. A spacing of 4 m to 6 m 
between tree plants may be adopted. In case block areas are available along the road side, 
the spacing grid of 3 m x 3 m may be adopted. Two rows of trees along rural roads may be 
provided where there is adequate Right-of-Way already available for two rows of trees.
2.3	
It should be borne in mind that for plantation, the strategy of using saplings of 
minimum 1.2 m height proves much more effective in reducing the mortality rate. The use of 
seedlings (less than 900 mm in height) shall be avoided in case of rural roads. The mortality 
of such seedlings along the road side is rather high.
2.4	
Sapling should be procured preferably from nursery of the forest department 
or any other Government Department. Further, for providing saplings in the plantations, a 
dedicated nursery of suitable capacity should also be raised. Schemes such as MGNREGS 
can be availed of for such purposes.



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 45
======================================================================
IRC:SP:103-2014
4
2.5	
Only quality planting material should be used for plantation.
2.6	
The plantation should be maintained for a period of four years from the year 
of planting. Vacancy filling/replacement should be carried out regularly from second year 
onwards. During initial stages of plantation, sometimes weeding and other plant diseases 
could occur. This will require particular attention.
2.7	
The raising of avenue plantation should form an integral component of rural road 
including PMGSY. Proper monitoring and evaluation of the plantation should be done as a 
follow-up.
2.8	
Nature has devised vegetation in a manner that only specific varieties thrive in 
particular climates. Planting of vegetation as a part of landscaping along rural roads should, 
therefore, be restricted as far as possible to local species already thriving in the area served 
by the road.
3  GENERAL  CONSIDERATIONS  NEEDING  ATTENTION
3.1	
Existing features along a road alignment, whether natural or man-made, can 
contribute significantly to general road landscape and every effort should be made to preserve, 
incorporate and integrate these into the landscape. A reconnaissance survey should be 
made to identify all valuable natural features such as natural wooded areas, streams, ponds, 
rock outcrops, scenic vistas etc., in addition to man-made features like historical buildings, 
monuments, gardens, etc. During design, and later during construction, every care should be 
taken to avoid damage to them.
3.2	
Conservation of existing grass and plant growth needs no emphasis. In all road 
cuttings, top soil should be preserved and reapplied after completion of grading operations, 
on slopes etc., to help growth of vegetation.
3.3	
While constructing roads in forest areas, felling of trees should be kept to bare 
minimum. Fire should never be used in cleaning operations as this will destroy natural 
regeneration of young trees and drive out wildlife. The effect of felling on undergrowth and 
wildlife also needs to be kept in view.
3.4	
In the design and development of arboriculture, certain restrictions imposed by 
engineering, traffic and safety requirements should be kept in view. Some of these are:
	
●	
Trees should be planted minimum 0.5 meter beyond the toe of the roadway 
and as close to the edge of the Right-of-Way as possible so that they are not 
a safety hazard or affect the required sight distance.
	
●	
Considerations of sight distance and safety be primary.
	
●	
Shrubs and trees should be planted clear of roadside drains and other 
drainage structures so that their root system does not interfere with efficient 
working of the drainage facilities.

3.5	
Typical cross-sections showing the location of trees on rural roads with different 
carriageway width and formation width are given in Figs. 1 to 3. To facilitate systematic 
execution of operations involved in roadside arboriculture, it will be advisable to prepare a 
detailed work plan including necessary drawings for field use. These should cover the scope 
and extent of the proposed activities, pattern, type and location of plantings, plant species to 
be used etc. and should be simple enough that can be easily understood by the field crews.

3.6	
Ornamental and flowering species of plants should be selected for plantation along 
the road, near the entry of village and also near the junctions from the main roads. Species 
with aroma which do not attract cattle should normally be proposed along the road.
3.7	
In areas where limited land is only available and farmers are reluctant for plantation 
because of shadow of plants, particular species like “Poplar” may be used for plantation, 
which leaves its leafs in winter avoiding shadow on crops in the nearby fields.

4  BROAD  GUIDELINES  FOR  ROADSIDE  PLANTATION
4.1	
General
4.1.1	
This section gives broad guidelines about different aspects of roadside arboriculture. 
For proper selection of plant, species of native plants have been recommended for different 
climatic regions. In Appendix-II, principal details of each of the species such as their name 
in different languages, characteristics of growth, and the suggested location of use has been 
described. This Appendix is divided into two categories. Category 1 are the species that are 
to be provided normally in a single row along rural roads. Category 2 are the species which 
can be provided only where two rows are possible.
4.1.2	
From the point of livelihood and nutrient angles, apart from the green factor, the 
plants can be divided into four categories (Refer Appendix-III).
4.2	
Selection of Species for Plantation
Trees, shrubs and climbers have been used to enhance the soft natural ambience against 
harsh elements in most of the enhancement schemes. The planting species are decided 
based on the physical growth characteristics of trees, like form and shape, foliage pattern, 
growth rate, branching pattern, soil characteristics and conditions of the strip like water 
logged areas etc. The selection of plant types and planting arrangement should be based on 
the following considerations:
	
●	
shape (spread of the tree) and size.
	
●	
texture and colour of foliage/flower/fruits in different seasons and stages of 
growth.
	
●	
adaptability and suitability to agro-climatic regions/zones.
	
●	
growth rate (slow/fast), average age of maturity and replacement cycle.
	
●	
after-care and maintenance required for sustenance and growth.
	
●	
economic and other social/recreational benefits.
	
●	
drawbacks and demerits if any, like prone to insects/pests disease, animal 
grazing and human interference.
4.3	
Other Considerations
Plantations along the embankment slopes and near major water bodies play a major role in 
the control of erosion. Similarly, green cover in the form of turfing stabilizes steep slopes and 
high embankments.
4.4	
Ornamental Trees
Generally, only one row of trees would be possible on rural roads. In such cases, ornamental 
species should be planted instead of shade bearing species. A combination of ornamental, 
shade and screening trees have been recommended. The number of rows and the repetition 
of the trees and their type vary with the road cross section and the space available in the 
RoW for tree plantation.

4.5	
Shade Plants
The shade trees in the second row, where sufficient land is already available, should be 
planted at a spacing of 8 to 12 metres. These tree species should be of local significance 
and should be mostly evergreen in nature, which ensures no substantial leaf-fall in winters 
preventing the problem of blockage of roadside drains. Trees with the following characteristics 
should be planted as shade trees:
	
i.	
Trees with high crown forms secure better visibility and are therefore ideal.
	
ii.	
Trees that retain their foliage longest are preferred to deciduous trees.
	
iii.	
Trees with long gestation period and having rapid growth and capacity to 
resist fungal and insects attack form ideal avenues.

Region-wise specific lists have been provided in the Annexes A to E. It is recommended that 
local experts from the Forest department and Horticulture department should be consulted 
before finalizing the choice of species for a particular stretch.
4.5.1	
Fruit Bearing Trees
Fruit bearing trees along the rural roads may be planted where sufficient land is available for 
planting of such trees in such a manner that they do not spread on to the road. For selection 
of fruit bearing trees reference may be made to Appendix-III. Fruit bearing trees and trees of 
medicinal values may also be preferred in case of block plantation. Community participation 
through social mobilization, in case of fruit bearing trees may be resorted to for safeguard of 
plants and fruits. This will also help in improvement of livelihood for rural people.
4.6	
Plantation in Special Areas
4.6.1	
Water Logged Areas
Waterlogged areas along the road are generally a result of inadequate drainage conditions, 
the road acting as a bund and contributing to water logging, high water table of the region or 
the low lying nature of the terrain itself. Planting in such sites after proper drainage is now 
a common practice. Jamun, Mahua and Mango are usually recommended for waterlogged 
areas. Bamboos can also be planted in such areas.
Soils become waterlogged when water builds up and is not able to drain away. This leaves 
no air spaces in the saturated soil, and plant roots literally drown. Waterlogging limits oxygen 
supply to the roots and prevents carbon dioxide from diffusing away. Root function is reduced

or it stops and the roots start to die off, allowing the invasion of rots and decay organisms. 
This has a subsequent effect on the visible parts of the plant, as the leaves and stems are 
unable to obtain enough water and nutrients.
Mounding is essential on wet sites. A study undertaken some time back showed that tree 
survival improved from 65 percent to over 95 percent by mounding on sites prone to seasonal 
waterlogging. On wet sites, mounds should be aligned to allow excess water to drain off 
the site without causing erosion. The drainage furrows created on each side of the mound 
provide important additional drainage. For maximum effect, these should be continuous, and 
connected into the drainage network. The mound should be constructed at least 200 mm to 
300 mm high and about 1000 mm wide. Even larger mounds may be required on very wet 
sites.

Alkaline Soils
Alkaline (Usar) soils are frequently encountered in some areas of the country. The species 
recommended for such soils include; Azadirachta indica, Ailanthus, Terminalia arjuna, 
Pongamia, Albizzia lebbeck, A. procera.

80% afterwards
In localities where a really bad patch of saline soil (usar) occurs, there is a need to dig deep 
pits by augur (mechanical device) to break the kankar pan down below and replacing the soil 
by good quality soil. The pits should be filled with the soil amender Gypsum (1 to 3 kg per pit, 
depending on the pH) along with 2 kg compost and sand. The treatment helps in lowering 
down the pH and thus enabling better survival of plants.
4.8	
Protection Measures
4.8.1	
Brushwood fencing or live fencing should be used to prevent the browsing of 
saplings by the cattle. Bamboo or locally available material may be used for making the tree 
guard. RCC/MS angles should not be used for rural roads.
4.8.2	
Brushwood fencing or live fencing – plantation of shrubs or hedge during the 
preparation of plantation site prior to tree plantation. These should be with spacing of 1 m, in 
two rows, with tree in between.

4.9 
Specifications for Grass Turfing
4.9.1	
The surface is to be prepared adequately for grass sowing. The grasses and 
shrubs planting is done to provide a strong surface cover but needs a well-prepared surface. 
All masses of loose debris should be removed. Any convexities should be removed and 
similarly any concavities are to be filled up by good soil. The surface should have sufficient 
layer of good quality soil (upto 450 mm) so as to have better growth and survival of grasses 
and shrubs.
4.9.2	
Grass lines are used to provide a strong surface cover but need a well-prepared 
surface in which to be planted. If grass is to be an effective form, then it must be allowed to 
establish properly on a slope which does not subject to undue stress from erosion and mass 
movement in its initial stages.
	
i.	
Sowing of grasses is intended to create a strengthened surface that is 
resistant to erosion.
	
ii.	
The condition of the site is good enough for the successful establishment of 
grasses.
	
iii.	
A cover of 25 grams of grass seed per square meter of surface should be 
achieved.
	
iv.	
The timing of sowing is of utmost importance. The seed sowing must be 
carried out before the onset of monsoon (May & June) so that they yield 
desired results. The watering of the surface will be done by tankers till the 
onset of the monsoon.
	
v.	
After sowing, mulch of prepared and dried out herbs should be laid over the 
whole seeded area in a thin layer so that the direct sunlight and transpiration 
loss may not affect the grasses.
4.10	
Activity Schedule
Plantation activities are highly time specific, as the plants respond to the seasonal variations 
in climatic conditions. Generally, plantation works are started in our country with the onset 
of monsoon. However, if it is possible to provide irrigation facilities, it is advisable to utilize 
the high temperatures of summers. Generally plants respond well to irrigation during peak 
summer seasons, as the conditions are very favourable for growth if moisture is not the 
limiting factor.
4.10.1	
Watering of Plants
Water is an essential component of living organism, since it contains 30-40 percent of 
their body weight. Most of the organic and inorganic substances are sparingly, partly and 
completely soluble in it. It is a major raw material for the photosynthesis by which plants 
produce their food.
The essential nutrients for plants are mostly transported by the water either by itself or when 
water mixes with other constituents like elemental, molecular or compound form. Sometimes, 
it may act as a bridge between two or more intra or inter-constituents which will help to supply 
the desired nutrients from soil and also from atmosphere.

The quantity of water requirement depends largely on the nature of species, soil quality, 
depth of the first aquifer and on the climatic condition of that area. The relative humidity, 
temperature, wind speed and wind direction have major role in this regard. About 450 to 650 
litres of water is required per plant per year since the very beginning of the plantation till it 
attains its normal safe size and growth i.e. about 6-7 years from the date of plantation. The 
external supply of water is to be continued till the roots of that species may be able to absorb 
the required quantity of water from the soil strata. The quantity and the frequency of watering 
is given in Table 5.

Training and Pruning of Shrubs
By nature of their growth, shrubs tend to take extra growth or unbalanced growth. Thus 
regular training and pruning by cutting and removal of undesired parts of twigs is required.
4.12.1	
Training
The process of providing desired form and size to a shrub plant is training. This is done by 
cutting away all growth that does not come in the desired frame, shape and size. Training of 
plants is started when they are still young. 3-4 branches are allowed to grow from main stem 
near the ground, radially to different directions. These are further divided into 2-3 branches 
each making oval shape of 3 m diameter in spread near the ground and 1.5 to 2 m high. This 
process is completed in 3-4 operations of cutting and pruning in first 2 years of growth. When 
the plants take their final size and shape, they are annually cut to this shape by pruning extra 
growth once or twice a year.
4.12.2	
Pruning
Pruning involves cutting and removal of parts, twigs, limbs or branches of shrubs. Besides 
giving desired shape and size, pruning helps in:
	
●	
Encouraging vigorous growth by allowing proper air, light and food to the 
parts retained.
	
●	
Removing over-crowding and weak branches.
	
●	
Removing dried up, diseased and pest infested parts.
	
●	
Regulating and increasing flowers/fruit production.
While doing operations of training/pruning; proper tools and implements like pruning knife, 
pruning saw, tree pruner, secateurs & shears etc. should be used. Care should be taken 
that bark of the plants is not damaged, ruptured, or pealed off. After deciding the framework 
to be retained, shoots should be cut back to desired size and shape. All the sick, thin and 
interwining twigs should be removed for allowing air and light to the desired ones.

Generally, flowering buds are produced in 6-8 months old shoots, which are usually cut 
away through repeated indiscriminate cutting without applying scientific principles of pruning. 
Consequently, neither these shrubs take their optimum spread (vertical & lateral) nor produce 
colourful flowers as required.
Time of pruning is important and it should be done only in the season of dormancy i.e. when 
the plants are not in active growth. This period comes usually from December to January & 
May to June. Blooming time is February to June & September to December. However, light 
pruning and pinching of tips can be done any time when it becomes necessary due to other 
emergent reasons of safety and sanitation etc.
5  Bio-Engineering  Measures  in  Slope  Stabilization  and  Protection
5.1	
Bio-engineering measures involving use of living plants shall be undertaken in 
conjunction with engineering solutions for stabilization and protection of road side slopes 
against erosion and to improve drainage. Bio-engineering works would be complementary 
to civil engineering structures and would normally not replace them. The materials and skills 
involving execution of bio-engineering measures are available in rural areas. Plants used 
in bio-engineering would perform one or more of the required functions of anchoring and 
reinforcing the surface material by extending roots down below into firmer strata, catching 
erodible material or debris or draining the excess water discharge from the slopes. Plant 
types and the methodology adopted for the plantation vary in their ability to resolve the 
various slope stabilization requirements. Hence, selection of the plants and the methodology 
for their adoption is a vital function for the success of the bio-engineering techniques. For 
details refer to Section 16 (Clause 1612) of the MoRD Specifications for Rural Roads, 
First Revision, 2014.
6  BRIDGE  STRUCTURES  AND  APPURTENANTS
6.1	
Bridges and Approaches
For bridge structures and their approaches, the following points may be kept in view:
	
i.	
The bridge structure including appurtenants like railings, parapet walls etc. 
should be 	designed to contribute to the overall aesthetics of the road and 
landscape.
	
ii.	
Approaches to bridges should blend with the terrain of the land, retaining 
natural beauty of the surrounding areas. Where possible, the approaches to 
major bridges should be so aligned that the bridge is visible from a distance 
and catches the eye of the road users, thereby breaking the monotony of 
travel.
	
iii.	
Adequate planting and other landscape measures in the proximity of bridges 
can enhance the beauty of the area.

6.2	
Intersections and Junctions with Main Roads
At intersections of rural roads with main roads, the plantation design should consider the 
basic standards of height limitations and appropriate sight lines. The intersection should be 
visible for sufficient distance from all the approaching roads.
7  MAINTENANCE  OF  ROADSIDE  PLANTATION
7.1	
Maintenance of roadside plantation includes a number of operations such as 
(i) tending saplings of trees and plants till they can stand by themselves, (ii) selective pruning 
of shrubs, trees etc., from considerations of traffic operations and safety, and (iii) maintenance 
of grass in turfed areas.
7.2	
Selective pruning or cutting of trees and shrubs will be required in situations where 
these (i) interfere with sight distance, (ii) come in the way of effective street illumination, 
(iii) are too close to the carriageway so as to be hazardous, (iv) conceal desirable views and 
scenic vistas, and (v) have become too old or dead.
7.3	
Maintenance of vegetation should be scheduled for the most effective seasons for 
each class of work. For example, grass mowing should be at intervals governed by growth 
rates, fertilizing of turf should precede maximum growth periods, and selective pruning of 
plants should precede the dormant period. Some items of roadside maintenance such as 
tree removal and tree care, which are not seasonal, may be scheduled for other periods.
7.4	
The trees and plants should be maintained under the guidance of horticulture staff 
and new plants put up wherever necessary in adequate time, especially to replace the dead 
and old trees. Proper working plans should be prepared where the work involves felling of 
mature trees/plantation.

Trees Suitable for Marshy Areas
Areas which remain waterlogged for a considerable period of the year come under this 
ecological environment. Trees suitable for such areas are:
1.	
Barringtonia acutangula
2.	
B. racemosa
3.	
Eucalyptus rostrate
4.	
Hibiscus tilliaceus
5.	
Salix babylonica
6.	
S. tetrasperma
7.	
Tamarix articulate
Of the above species eucalyptus rostrate can not only grow under marshy conditions, but 
has capacity to draw up large quantities of water for transpiration. Sometimes this species is 
used for drying up marshy land.
Trees Suitable for Saline Tracts
Saline tract is present along the coastal areas where the tidal waves submerge the land 
periodically. Besides, vast saline tracts are met within the country where waterlogging is 
a perennial problem. Here the accumulated body of water finds release mainly in to the 
atmosphere through evaporation leaving behind the salts on the surface. This condition for 
decades, or even for centuries, have turned the soil very saline. Trees suitable for such tracts 
are those that can stand drought as well as high concentration of salinity. The example of 
such trees are:
1.	
Acacia auriculiformis
2.	
Butea monosperma
3.	
Casuarina equisetifolia
4.	
Cochlospermum religiosum
