GUIDELINES FOR PARKING FACILITIES IN URBAN AREAS
1 INTRODUCTION
The Guidelines for Parking Facilities in Urban Areas was first published in 1973. With the 
change in urban infrastructural concepts, introduction of multimode of transportation, growth 
in urban population, use of vehicles and vehicles of many wheels, many families needing/
using more vehicles/cars. The Urban Roads, Streets and Transport Committee (H-8)  felt 
the need of revising the Guidelines to meet the challenges of present day parking and the 
challenges of future. A Sub Committee comprising of Dr. P.K. Sarkar,  Shri R. Jai Prasad, Dr. 
B.P. Bagish and Shri R.K. Jaigopal prepared the draft revision of IRC:SP:12 “Guidelines for 
Parking Facilities in Urban Areas”. The H-8 Committee deliberated on the draft revision in a 
series of meetings and approved the same in its meeting held on 15th November, 2014 for 
placing before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS).

The HSS Committee approved the draft revision in its meeting held on 12th January, 2015. The 
Executive Committee in its meeting held on 18th January, 2015 approved the draft revision for 
placing it before the Council. The Council in its 204th meeting held at Bhubaneswar, Odisha 
on 19th January, 2015 approved the draft IRC:SP:12-2015 “Guidelines for Parking Facilities 
in Urban Areas” (First Revision) for publishing.
1.1	
Annual urban population growth rate in last two decades has been above national 
average growth by more than 1%. Urban population constitutes more than 30% of total 
population out of which 41% resides in metropolitan cities. In Metropolitan Cities two to three 
decades earlier, the percentage of two wheelers was as high as 75%, whereas four wheelers 
(cars) were 2% - 3%.  The situation has changed and now two wheelers are 60% and four 
wheelers (cars) are 15% - 20% requiring more parking area. Against decadal rise of 3 to 
9% in number of  two wheelers, rise in four wheelers is 10 to 12% in Metropolitan & in class 
One Cities. Statistics of population, numbers of registered vehicles of top twenty cities of the 
country are in Annexure I. This has happened due to rise in economic level of individuals 
and liberal policy of financial institutions and preference to safety of persons in comparison 
to two wheelers.  Many families have more than one car and need to be encouraged to go for 
carpooling. The statistics of a Metropolitan City in the Country indicates that 30% of cars are 
parked on roads (local to arterial) and a city with 8 Lakh cars with parallel parking requires 
about 2000 km of road network. 
1.2	
The provisions of parking spaces need to be evolved periodically due to fast pace of 
urbanization and rapid motorization, which is making the cities denser and congested. Timely 
planning and implementation will remove the bottlenecks which may be observed due to 
future high density development in future associated with high land cost in urban areas.

1.3	
When dealt positively, parking can form a valuable economic asset for the local 
community.  With proper parking management under well founded parking policies, the parking 
facilities can generate economic opportunities and good revenue, apart from improving the 
liveability of any town, while also supporting sustainable transport and the parking business 
itself. In urban situations, meeting parking demands turns out to be difficult and can transfer 
into a problem.  Yet when managed properly and under well founded parking policy, parking 
will be an asset.
1.4	
Provision of inadequate parking in the cities in the absence of mass transit facilities 
bears a significant effect leading to high degree of traffic congestion and high level of noise 
and air pollution in the cities. Even the incidence of road rage has become a common feature 
due to scarcity of parking supply in a city of Delhi. 
1.5	
In general, a vehicle remains in parking for 8360 hours out of 8760 hours in a year 
(5% of the time in a day). It is a well-established fact that there is a need to ensure availability 
of parking space at least for nearly 22 hours in day where only vehicle is seen in operation for 
two hours out of 24 hours in a day.  It means whenever a new vehicle is added to the street, 
it means that additional demand for parking facility is added in the city. 
1.6	
The generation of traffic demand is not uniform in all activity zones and varies 
according to type and intensity of land uses.  For example, the requirement of parking supply 
would be different for residential areas than that of commercial areas. In industrial areas, the 
generation of traffic is totally different in nature primarily characterized by a large scale of 
goods traffic. Therefore the requirement of parking supply would be to accommodate goods 
vehicles based on the intensity of industrial activities. 
1.7	
The question is to what extent parking supply should be provided for different types 
of land use. What would the rationale to work out a balance between parking demand and 
supply? What kind of parking policy need to be advocated to ensure sustainable growth 
of traffic where parking of vehicles in the city with proper planning and design can be 
accommodated efficiently and safely.
1.8	
Keeping this in view, it is of utmost importance to develop guidelines for parking 
facilities in urban areas for all types of vehicles including passenger and goods vehicles 
under the categories of motorized and non-motorized vehicles.

2 Scope
2.1	
Parking is an act of stopping and disengaging a vehicle and leaving it unoccupied. 
Proper provision of parking plays a pivotal role in transportation, building design, quality 
of life and environmental issues. The provision of off-street or separated on-street parking 
spaces in urban areas benefits a city by way of removal of obstacles from the carriageways, 
thus improving the steady flow of traffic and the carriageway capacity. This contributes to 
a city’s economic activities by ensuring a turnaround of different vehicles rather than long 
stay of the vehicles in commercial areas. It also satisfies the social objectives in terms of 
supplying adequate parking spaces at certain locations for specific social groups like persons 
with special mobility. 
2.2	
The purpose of this guidelines is for the reference of vehicle owners, drivers, 
pedestrian, ULB’s, Government and Concessionaries of PPP projects for parking. Document 
highlights the need for addressing issues of parking in cities consequent to the accelerated 
urban growth and rise in vehicle ownership in last two decades. Provision of parking space 
in different type of buildings/land uses are outlined according to the city size as well as policy 
measures of restrictions for parking are also given for maintaining efficiency of urban transport 
system in general and safety of the road users in particular. Guidelines also describe various 
types of parking systems with their suitability and measures for their efficient usage and 
management policies. 
2.3	
The guidelines are elaborating on innovative approaches for addressing the issue 
of parking in areas like CBD and dense commercial activity areas for all types of vehicles. 
The main objective of the parking provisions in the standards is to concentrate on different 
category of urban roads. The parking provisions for residential, commercial, industrial and 
other types of buildings are regulated by urban local bodies and local governments. Actual 
demand for parking shall be estimated according to the specific local situation in a city.

3 Parking policy objectives and guiding principles
3.1	
Parking demand is gregarious, aggressive, and insatiable. Therefore parking 
provision should aim for parking restraint so as to reduce the growth and usage of car. 
The main principle of a parking policy is to provide parking with a view to not to increase 
more parking demand but manage and restrain its provision to discourage people from using 
personal vehicles. 60% of all trips made in Delhi are short trips which can easily be made on 
the alternate modes of public transport.
3.2	
Objectives of Parking Policy
Broad objectives of the policy for parking in cities are as under:
	
1.	
To provide relief of congestion for improved environment 
	
2.	
To reduce parking demand through increased parking cost 
	
3.	
To promote  public transport for comprehensive mobility
3.3	
The general principles of any parking policy for parking system facility are presented 
as under:
	
1.	
To achieve optimum utilization of available parking spaces
	
2.	
Turnover of each available space must be increased 
	
3.	
To discourage long term parking
	
4.	
To carry out rationalization of available parking spaces
	
5.	
Long term parking shall be accommodated on off street lots
	
6.	
Quality of the parking facility should be considered as important as quantity, 
including aesthetics, security, and accessibility and user information.
	
7.	
High parking fee should be charged in order to make the use of public transport 
attractive. 
	
8.	
The parking fee should reflect the value of the land that is occupied. 
	
9.	
Public transport vehicles and non-motorized modes of transport shall be given 
preference in the parking space allocation. This along with easier access of work 
places to and from such parking spaces can encourage the use of sustainable 
transport systems.
	
10.	 Park and ride facilities for bicycle users with convenient interchange are a useful 
measure.

11.	 Effective management of parking space through use of ITS technologies 
	
12.	 To free the public carriageway from parked vehicles impeding the smooth flow 
of traffic in residential areas also by changing the byelaws. 
	
13.	 Parking is a consumer commodity, not a legal right. No subsidized parking is to 
be provided in public spaces. User must pay full cost of parking facility based 
on land opportunity cost, capital cost, O&M costs and temporal demand.
	
14.	 To ensure accessibility to maximum number of people, parking for para-transport/ 
feeder modes is to be prioritized and subsidized. In areas designated for private 
parking, short term parkers must be prioritized over long-term parkers, in order 
to maximize turnover and enable economic vibrancy.
	
15.	 Spaces already designated for parking must be utilized to highest efficiency 
and financial viability.
	
16.	 Parking management is to be used as a demand management tool – to decrease 
use of private vehicles and thus reduce overall demand of parking, and shift 
travel to public transport, para-transport & non-motorized modes.
	
17.	 Private vehicle must be parked on ‘a fully-paid rented or owned’ private space.
3.4	
Multilevel parking complexes should be made a mandatory requirement in city centres 
that have several high-rise commercial buildings. The investments in such parking facility 
can be made viable through user charges. Commercial complexes with state of art parking 
facilities can come up through public-private partnerships. These would be encouraged to go 
in for electronic metering so that there is better recovery of the cost of using valuable urban 
space in the parking of personal motor vehicles. 
3.5	
Graded scale of parking fee shall be adopted for recovering the economic cost of the 
land used in such parking with the objective of persuading people to use public transport to 
reach city centres.
3.6	
The parking policy lays emphasize on adoption of information and communication 
technology in parking to inform the vehicle users about the availability of parking place (slot) 
in the respective area as they approach the space which will prevent searching for parking 
slots and also disturbance to the traffic on the main carriageway. Signage with variable 
message in some of the cities are provided informing the congestion in certain roads, safety 
measures like seat belts, dark glasses, drunken driving etc. In addition parking details can 
also be displayed along with the nearest & the next parking area & distance. Photos -3.1 and 
3.2.
Latest technology of swipe card (Photo - 3.3) mobile applications and also centralized 
information system about availability of parking space with display on different roads is 
suggested along with adoption of surveillance cameras etc.

Parking Management
3.7.1	
ULBs shall identify roads, areas where, on-street parking is allowed in consultation 
with Traffic Police who control the movement of traffic.  While identifying the roads, due 
publicity shall be given with display boards, type of parking, whether parallel, angle, 
perpendicular, carriageway width and marking.  Parking on alternative days (odd and even 
days) on each side of the road is suggested for adoption so that the riding surface wears 
evenly and facilitates cleaning of road.  
3.7.2	
In commercial and CBD areas near markets, adequate space shall be provided 
for vehicles especially HUV, mini goods vehicles like mini trucks, covered three wheelers.

 Parking Restrictions 
3.8.1	
A few parking management strategies, which have demonstrated significant benefit 
in different cities in the world with considerable reduction of parking demand, are given below 
in Table 3.1. 
Table 3.1 Parking Management Strategies
PARKING MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
Based on Design
Improve parking facility design and operations to help solve 
problems and support parking management
Prices based
Parking fees can be done according to zone, peak hour 
demand, weekdays and weekends, etc. by charging higher 
rates during peak hour with progressive increase in rates per 
hour
TOD based
 Substantially replace ECS with cycle, Para-transport and HOV 
parking in high PTAL zones
Unbundle Parking
Provide parking facilities separately from building space
Improve User Information 
and Marketing
Convenient and accurate information should be provided on 
parking availability and price 
Parking Pricing
Motorists must be directly and efficiently charged for using 
parking facilities
Mobility Management
More efficient travel patterns, like changes in mode, destination, 
timing, and trip frequency must be encouraged
Smart Growth
More compact, multi-modal development must be encouraged 
to allow more parking development

3.8.2	
Specifications prescribing permissible level of parking on different categories of 
urban roads in IRC:103 are as under:
	
 
Arterial: - A general term denoting street primarily for through traffic usually 
on continuous route. It is along with expressways where they exist. It serves 
the principal network for through traffic flows. Parking, loading and unloading 
activities are usually restricted.
	
 
Sub-Arterial:- It is the street primarily for through traffic usually on a continuous 
route but offering somewhat lower level traffic mobility than the arterial. Their 
spacing may vary from 0.5 km in central business district to 3-5 km in sub-urban 
fringes.
	
 
Collector Street:- A street for collecting and distributing the traffic from and to 
local streets and also for providing access to arterial streets. The function of 
collector street is to collect traffic from local streets and distribute the traffic to 
arterial and sub-arterial streets or vice-versa. Full access is allowed on these

streets from abutting land uses.
	
 
Local Street:- It is the street primarily for access to residence, business or 
other abutting land uses. Local streets are intended to serve the function of 
accessibility and normally do not carry large volume of traffic. Local streets may 
be residential, commercial and industrial depending on the predominant use of 
the adjoining land.
In addition to this, it is desirable to prohibit parking at certain locations and for a specified 
period to ensure safety & convenience. Such locations are: 
	
a)	
Near Intersections: the capacity of an intersection is greatly reduced if vehicles 
are allowed to park on the approaches. Visibility is also adversely affected & 
safety is reduced. It is the general practice to prohibit parking for a distance of 
about 50 m on the approaches to a major intersection.
	
b)	
Narrow Streets: Narrow streets with heavy traffic require that all possible 
measures should be taken to remove obstacles to traffic flow. Prohibition of 
parking can have a salutary effect on traffic flow & congestion. In busy street of 
the central area, it is generally desirable to prohibit parking on two-way streets 
with less than 5.75 m width & one-way streets less than 4 m width.
	
c)	
Pedestrian Crossings: Desirable to prohibit parking within about 8.0 m from the 
pedestrian crossings.
	
d)	
Structures: Structures such as bridges, tunnels and underpasses generally 
have a road way width less than the highway and for this reason it is desirable 
to prohibit parking on them.
	
e)	
Entrance Driveways:  Vehicles should be prohibited from parking in front of 
entrance to building. 
	
f)	
Desirable to prohibit parking on roads widened for increasing capacity by 
acquiring land & structures (Photos  3.5 and 3.6)
	
g)	
Prohibit parking on designated roads during peak hours
	
h)	
No parking on arterial roads where available carriageway width is less than 7.25 
m (individually in 4 lanes). No parking on sub-arterial roads where available 
carriageway width is less than 7.5 m.  No parking on collector streets where 
available carriageway width is less than 5.5 m. Parking on one side on local 
streets where available carriageway is not less than 5.5 m and both sides where 
carriageway is more than 10.5 m. (Photos 3.7 and 3.8)

 Parking Facility Construction
	
This is generally the duty of ULBs who identify Government and ULB lands for 
construction of multilevel/basement car parking in CBD areas.  This can also be on land 
reserved for conservancy purpose or vacant land.  Construction of Basement/Multi Level Car 
Parking (MLCP) can be taken up out of own funds or through PPP.  Owners of vacant sites 
can be permitted to use their land as parking areas.  Space underneath HT overhead lines, 
where constructions are banned can be considered for parking.  Some of the ULB lands can 
be developed as parking-cum-shopping malls/multiplex under PPP model as parking alone 
will not be profitable for the Concessionaire.
3.10	
In a few of the large cities, planning management defines types of areas namely A, 
B & C as identified as below:
	
A: 	 Where public transport is easily available
	
B:	
Where public transport is moderately available
	
C:	
Where public transport is scarcely available

Business parking
	
(iii)	 Ordinary parking
Fig. 3.1 Parking Zones in Core Area
The parking fee scales down from A to C depending on the land value.  Annual revision 
of parking fee based on wholesale price index is adopted. In addition, higher fee during 
weekends and peak hours is also recommended.
3.11	
For operating & maintaining on designated streets, Concession Agreement under 
PPP model for parking management can also be proposed wherein Concession period will 
be for five years or as decided by and investment on surveillance cameras, marking, parking 
meters, automatic collection & other requirements will be made by Concessionaire on revenue 
sharing arrangement. 
3.12	
Parking in city residential areas with increased affluence & densification is increasing 
day by day due to misuse of basement/garages. Due to this, the parking in residential area has 
largely been on the streets especially local streets. This inconveniences the residents from 
pulling out their vehicles at times especially during emergency. This needs to be discouraged 
by enforcing provision of city building bylaw & also parking vehicles within the premises. 
3.13	
In order to develop proper guidelines for parking facilities, it becomes imperative 
to revisit some Asian cities to appreciate the provision of parking facilities emerging from 
adoption of transport policies primarily concerned with restraint approach both from the 
point of traffic congestion and parking. The policies adopted successfully in Asian cities of 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul are given in Annexure II.

4 Parking STRATEGIES fOR different modes of transport
4.1	
Parking Strategies with Respect to Category of Vehicle
Cars
	
 
Parking revenue for the Urban Local Bodies shall be generated from pricing of 
parking facilities and no conversion changes or one time parking fee or in-lieu 
parking charges shall be levied for private parking facilities.
	
 
Localized variable scale of parking fee based on time, location and use 
depending on the local demand and congestion level shall be implemented.
	
 
Spill over parking from high-priced areas must be minimized through pricing 
and enforcement, as it may cause excessive congestion within neighbourhood 
streets.  Market rate parking pricing shall be applied to entire zone, not just a 
few streets.  The entire area shall be implemented as a parking benefit district.
Buses
	
 
Multi-use of large public parking facilities can be permitted for use in off-peak 
hours for parking buses and commercial vehicles on chargeable basis.
	
 
Underside of flyovers, overpasses and underpasses should not be permitted 
for parking of any type of transport vehicle to avoid fire hazard.
Trucks
	
 
Parking facility shall be provided for Heavy Transport Vehicles for the purpose of 
loading and unloading only at respective commercial locations like designated 
markets, godowns, industrial areas etc. On road parking of such vehicles shall 
be prohibited in urban limits.
Intermediate Public Transport
	
 
Priority and subsidized parking should be provided for intermediate public 
transport like taxis, auto-rickshaw, feeder van’s etc. at;
	
	
	 All bus terminals and stops
	
	
	 All metro/mono railway stations
	
	
	 Near all important buildings either private, public etc.
	
	
	 Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) like cycle rickshaw’s cycle rental, cycles, 
vendor carts, cycle carts etc. shall be treated in par with IPT for parking 
facilities.

 Parking of Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) like parking of taxis, auto-
rikshaws, feeder vans and similar vehicles.
Emergency Vehicles
All types of emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire engines, police vehicles could be 
parked on all categories of roads at designated and appropriate locations without encroaching 
carriageway, footpath, and cycle track and side shoulders.  They can be demarcated on 
ground with proper signage.
The dimension of non-motorized vehicles with figure & motorized vehicles are given in 
Annexure III
4.2.	
Priority, subsidized and designated parking shall be provided for intermediate public 
transport like, taxis, auto-rickshaws, and feeder vans. While waiting for the passengers at;
	
a.	
All bus terminals and stops
	
b.	
All intercity and intracity railway stations
	
c.	
Near Metro Rail Stations
	
d.	
Near all important buildings either private or public
	
e.	
Within shopping and commercial areas, near entertainment and recreational 
places
4.3	
These parking facilities should not be used for long term parking. Non Motorized 
Transport (NMT) like cycle rickshaws, cycle rental, cycles, vendor carts, cycle carts etc. shall 
be treated on par with Intermediate Public Transport Vehicles (IPT) for parking facilities.
4.3.1	
Parking private vehicles
This category of parking shall be carefully dealt with so that present situation of bursting and 
serious lack of parking facilities shall be converted with time,  into positive form of revenue 
generating mechanism, which shall be a valuable economic asset to the ULB.  This shall 
serve citizenry, for effective and efficient parking system so that, they carry on with their 
normal chores. A synchronized on-street, off-street and multilevel parking system with proper 
enforcement will be a key to its success.  Parking management strategy for private vehicles’ 
shall be;
4.3.2.	
In-house/In-office/In-society parking should be carried out at parking spaces duly 
regulated by building and land enforcement agencies of the area.
4.3.3.	
Parking revenue for the ULB’s shall be generated from pricing of parking facilities 
and no conversion charges or one time parking fee or in-lieu parking charges shall be levied 
for private parking facilities.

4.3.4.	
Localized variable scale of parking fee based on time, location and congestion level 
shall be implemented.
4.3.5.	
Spillover parking from high-priced areas must be minimized through pricing and 
enforcement, as it may cause excessive congestion within neighborhood streets.  Market 
rate parking pricing shall be applied to entire zone, not just a few streets.  The entire area 
shall be implemented as a parking benefit district.
4.3.6.	
In case of heavy activity areas, private parking should be regulated by way of time 
restrictions either by using fee tags, discs, or installing parking meters.
4.3.7.	
Parking of vehicles near schools is hindering free flow of traffic and on the road (Photo 
4.1) should be regulated in accordance with local bye laws. Dedicated and marked parking 
should be provided by the institution either within premises or at the entrance, and shall not 
spill over to connected public roads. The alternative that is being attempted by some cities is 
termed “Safe Way to School” wherein school children are ferried by Govt. Undertaking Buses 
and use of individual vehicles by parents for Drop & Pickup is discouraged.

5 Parking Benefit Districts
5.1	
Urban local bodies shall identify specific urban wards or part of wards or combination 
of wards to identify congested roads, areas, networks where parking supply appears to be 
deficient and/or high levels of encroachment of roads, footpaths, public spaces etc. by private 
vehicle persists.  Such wards or part of wards or combination of urban wards shall be declared 
as “parking benefit districts”.
Parking benefit districts are to be planned to improve availability of on-street and 
off-street parking and promote public transport, cycling and walking spaces.  A parking benefit 
district provides more net available parking space in an area by increasing parking turnover 
through good design, management and pricing of spaces.  A parking benefit district provides 
comprehensive facility provisions for all modes including pedestrians, non motorised transport, 
cycle tracks, IPT parking, vending zones, bus stops, public amenities etc. in addition to on-
street or/and off-street parking for private vehicles.
5.2	
ULBs in consultation with planning bodies, local stakeholders shall develop detailed 
parking benefit district plans with physical design and demarcation of spaces on ground and 
not the least, a rigid and strict enforcement.
5.3	
PBDs are to be planned to improve availability of on-street and off-street parking and 
promote public transport, cycling and walking spaces.  A Parking Benefit District provides more 
net available parking space in an area by increasing parking turnover through good design, 
management and pricing of spaces.  A PBD provides comprehensive facility provisions for 
all modes, including pedestrians, non motorized transport, cycle tracks, intermediate public 
transport vehicles parking, vending zones, bus stops, public amenities etc. in addition to on-
street or/and off-street parking for private vehicles.
5.4	
Establishment of parking benefit districts can serve as a financing tool to support 
improvements in old areas, while also addressing traffic congestion and parking constrains. 
Within a parking benefit district, public parking spaces i.e. both on and off street parking are 
charged on hourly rate designed to keep approximately 15% of the parking spaces vacant. 
Funds collected from parking charges are poured directly into improvements that make 
the PBD more attractive, such as sidewalks, landscaping and other amenities or aesthetic 
improvements. In addition, traffic congestion in the PBD will be reduced by around 30% 
because downtown shoppers and employees will no longer need to circle, block-after-block in 
search of vacant parking spaces. New parking meter technologies have improved customer 
convenience like customers can pay remotely by credit card or through cell phone. Increased 
pricing flexibility like, rates that can be charged in real time based on location, time of day, 
day of week or level of occupancy and also reduce street space occupancy and reduce 
operating costs.

5.5	
Implementing agencies 
Generally ULB’s are the implementing agencies.  A proposal for parking benefit district can 
be initiated by community groups such as respective area merchants association or urban 
neighborhoods whose streets fill up daily with spillover parking by employees and shoppers, 
or it can be solely implemented by respective Urban Local Body.
5.6	
Key to Success
5.6.1. 	 Education and involvement of local businesses
Local businesses may initially resist the idea of parking benefits district, as they think that 
free on-street parking is essential for them to compete with suburban shopping centers. 
Addressing these concerns involves a two-part discussion.  First local area businesses 
must understand and promote the unique qualities, that make their location a more pleasant 
and attractive place for strolling, shopping and dining than shopping malls surrounded by 
a sea of asphalt.  Second they shall be closely involved in developing plans for the use of 
funds generated by the parking meters. All of these are dedicated solely towards improving 
the attractiveness and accessibility of the PBD. If ULB initiates all such activities, then said 
activities shall be co-actively managed by local community and ULB.
5.7	
Planning, Administration and Documenting
5.7.1	
A PBD requires staff support from local administration, planning, public works and 
economic development agencies.  Once all in place, the revenue collection process should 
be fairly easy, but it is important to allocate some staff resources to make sure that the 
community knows how the funds are being utilized.
5.8	
Getting started
5.8.1	
The essential first step to establish PBD is early outreach to businesses and 
neighborhoods.  Business community in particular to be convinced of the benefits of charging 
for parking both in terms of higher turnover and increased parking availability for their 
customers, and ability to reinvest parking revenues to improve local area.  The boundaries, 
pricing level and other parking policies must be considered. New or amended parking rules 
may be passed in ULB or by a state ordinance for implementation of the PBD. While it may 
be politically preferable to start small in terms of district size and pricing, care must be taken 
to ensure that the continued presence of convenient free parking near a proposed district 
does not undermine the long term viability of the PBD.  Once the first parking district is 
implemented, staff will be responsible for managing the operations and allocating revenues 
towards desired improvement projects.

6 TYPES OF PARKING SPACES AND LAYOUTS
6.1	
The urban parking facilities can be divided into three main categories namely: 
	
	
On-Street Parking Facility
	
	
Off-Street Parking Facility
	
	
Special Parking Facilities
As regards operation, there are two main types:  i. Free parking and ii. Paid Parking:
6.1.1	
Free parking
These facilities mainly comprise of company or public administrations for car parks. Parking 
spaces in car parks or commercial garages may belong to, or rented by private companies 
or public administrations that provide free parking to their employees during work time, to 
visitors for business trips, or for commercial vehicles.
6.1.2	
Paid parking
Parking spaces may be made available by private companies or public authorities on payment 
of parking fees. Car parks can be available in open-air or located in buildings. For short 
or medium-duration parking, users pay by the hour, the price being decided upon by the 
operator of the car park. Pricing can be strategic to encourage short term and medium-term 
parking, progressive to dissuade it, free for first hour to encourage short term parking, involve 
reimbursement of parking fee by shop owners to encourage purchases and finally, vary in 
accordance with the purpose of parking in the given area. As regards long-term parking 
connected with work or residence, the car park operators let spaces or propose subscriptions. 
In the case of car parks with concessions, users can, avail if they wish, buy a place with 
guarantee of use for the duration of concession.
6.2	
On-Street Parking Facility
On-street parking facility is usually at the curb side at the edge of the carriageway, on the 
lateral strips parallel to the road way, or on particular road areas such as squares, or other 
surface, forming part of the publically owned road space. This facility is found in shopping 
areas at the door step of shopping units where turnover is high and rapid access to the 
customer. Based on operational and regulatory system there are three types of on-street 
parking facilities.
	
	
Free parking of long duration
	
	
Free parking of limited duration with strict enforcement
	
	
Parking system involving payment of fee



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 59
======================================================================

IRC:SP:12-2015
19
Following are a few types of On-street parking based upon the layout design:
	
	
Parallel parking: Parking the vehicle in line with other vehicles parallel to the 
kerb, front bumper to rear bumper.
	
	
Perpendicular parking: Parking the vehicle side by side, perpendicular to 
kerb.
	
	
Angle parking: Angle parking is similar to perpendicular parking, except the 
vehicles are aligned in an angle.
	
	
Pay and display parking: Pay and displays means that the person who parked 
the vehicle has to walk to the nearest parking machine and buy a ticket.  The 
ticket is placed on the dashboard of the vehicle and enforcement officers audit 
by looking in vehicles for receipts.  These pay and display systems can be used 
both on and off-street.
	
	
Disk parking: On some places where parking time limit is set which it is 
monitored using parking disks.  The owner of the car uses this disk to indicate 
the time when he parked the vehicle; he places a disk on the dash board.  This 
is controlling aspect for revenues.
	
	
On Kerb parking: This may be allowed in residential and less congested 
commercial areas. Kerb in such areas/cases will be mountable to road side to 
give easy access in parking.  
6.3	
Off-Street Parking
These are surface parking lots and car park structures either underground or elevated. 
Underground parking or roof top parking could be used to provide 100% usage of the land. 
Access to these facilities can be made for either public or private use. They can be managed 
by the municipality or by private or semi-public enterprises. 
Off-street is the parking of vehicles at places other than the on-the-streets
Types of Off-street parking commonly considered are: 
	
a.	
Surface car parking	
	
b.	
Underground parking
	
c.	
Multi – level car parking
	
d.	
Roof parking 
	
e.	
Mechanical parking

6.3.1.	
Surface car parking
Usually these are provided at the surface and at some distance from the activity area to be 
catered. These are known as ‘surface lots’. Arrangements are made for the systematic entry 
and exit of the vehicles. Stalls are designated by vehicle types and proper circulation area 
is designed for speedier movements of the parking or un-parking vehicles. Safety provisions 
need to be considered for the drivers and passengers near parking spaces and in circulation 
areas. These can be developed on private or public land and the investment is minimum. This 
is the first option depending on the availability and size of vacant land. Private land owners 
can also be permitted for creating parking facility in vacant lands till permanent structure of 
their own is put-up. Concessions could be extended to the land owners to encourage usage 
of their vacant land for public parking (Fig. -6.1 a to g) High mast lights can be provided for 
illumination.  
Fig. 6.1 a, b, c, d, e, f & g : Surface Car Parking Lots
6.3.2	
Underground parking
It is also known as basement parking. Underground parking spaces are mostly located in city 
centers or below play grounds or at similar locations, where there is not much space available 
to build a parking facility, but there is an immediate need to build one. This can be provided

underneath apartments and also commercial buildings to provide parking facility to inmates 
& also for public, visiting the commercial building (Photos 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 & 6.4).  The norms 
for entry and exit of ramps width as well as gradient are similar to the one recommended for 
MLCP. Underground parking involves large quantities   of excavation, construction of retaining 
walls, ventilation and lighting. These can also be single level or multilevel depending on the 
need and based on type of soil, presence of water table. However the underground parking 
involves considerable investment. 
Photo 6.1  Underground Parking                              Photo 6.2 Two Level Underground Parking
Photos  6.3 and 6.4 Lighting of Underground Parking
Underground parking requires proper illumination during all hours. Minimum illumination of 
50-75 lux shall be provided through proper lighting systems.
Drainage problem in underground parking can be addressed by providing perforated pipes at 
floor level or covered drain network and connected to sump of adequate capacity depending 
on area of parking and water table with automatic pumping. Whenever water table raises or 
filled by smaller drains along and across the basement the water starts collecting in the sump 
which gets automatically pumped out to the nearby drain. 
Provisions of staircase in underground parking shall be made considering safety during fire 
or any other untoward incidences or emergencies.

Where the basement is inadequate ground level parking shall be provided as additional 
parking facility as per norms of the building bylaws of the city. Such provisions are also 
known as stilt parking. In addition, two level parking can be adopted in parking area to create 
additional parking (Photo 6.5) 
Photo 6.5 Two Level parking
6.3.3	
Multi-level parking
Parking comprising of more than two levels should be provided in respect of Apartments 
& Commercial Establishments including Malls, Multiplex for parking of cars. This requires 
considerable investment and also availability of land and investment by urban local body 
and/or private participation. In a few instances, where urban local bodies have invested, they 
are unable to get returns due to reluctance of the vehicle owners not preferring parking in 
multi-level car parking. 
Within developed urban areas, multi-level parking should be developed as mixed use projects 
with the following norms:
	
	
A maximum of 70% of gross/FAR may be utilized as commercial office space, 
with the remaining accommodating residential uses like hostels, service 
apartments, budget hotels, etc.  
	
	
Bus parking sites can have 100% ground coverage to optimized use of land. 
Maximum height shall be as per local constrains like flight paths, heritage zones 
etc.
	
	
There will be no restriction on the number of levels of basement subject to 
structural safety.
	
	
For comprehensive schemes, development controls shall be as per approved 
scheme.
	
	
A comprehensive parking benefit district shall be formed to have overall parking 
control.

This could be successful with joint venture by ULB’s owning land with private investors under 
PPP model with construction of Mall, Multiplex with parking for both commercial and additional 
parking for outsiders (Photos – 6.6 & 6.7). 
Photos  6.6 and 6.7 Commercial Construction with Additional Parking (MLP) under PPP Model 
Following strategies are recommended for successful operation of MLP:
	
i)	
A 1000 m (10 minute walking) radius around the multi-level facility shall be 
designated a strict ‘no-parking’ zone for all streets.  Road space within this zone 
may be reclaimed for Intermediate Public Transport Vehicles/Non Motorized 
Transport parking and pedestrians.  
	
ii)	
In case it is essential to provide on-street parking within the 1000 m zone, it 
should be priced exponentially (minimum 3-20 times higher than the off-street 
parking) so that the multi-level facility has more demand, thus making it viable 
for the parking provider to cross-subsidies the facility.
	
iii)	
On-street parking is the premium, most convenient parking space having 
maximum demand.  Low-pricing of on-street parking will lead to the failure of 
off-street multi-level parking facilities. 
	
iv)	
Public multi-level parking facilities’ (Photos 6.8 and 6.9) cost can never be 
recovered through simple pricing. It should be recovered through cross subsidy 
from on-street pricing within the PBD.
	
v)	
The cost of multi-level parking is too high to recover by simple user pays 
principle.  The only way revenue can be generated for the service provider is, if 
the surrounding area is managed by the same agency and returns on parking 
are generated from the steeply priced short-term on-street parking.  For this 
reason, multi-level parking projects in a PBD must only be implemented as 
comprehensive PBD projects managed eventually by a single public/private 
entity.

Some of the desirable standards for designing of the multi-story car parks are:
	
(i)	
Gradient of the ramp : 1 in 10 generally & 1 in 8 for very short ramps
	
(ii)	
Clear height between floors : 2.1 m Parking stall dimensions 2.5 m X 5 m 	 	
(Photos 6.19 and 6.20)

(iv)	 Width of traffic lane on ramps & entrance : 3.75 m
	
(v)	
Gradient of sloping floors : Not steeper than 1 in 20  (Photos 6.10 and 6.11)
Additional width of at least single lane width to be provided in front of MLCP for entry and exit 
to exit without disturbing the traffic on main carriageway, however it is  preferable to provide 
entry and exit ramps at the rear of MLCP or to the road with  less traffic. However each city 
has its own building bylaws. 
Photos 6.10 and 6.11 Ramps to MLCP
6.3.4	
Roof parking
It is a popular method of solving the parking problems adopted in many cities is to park the 
vehicles on roof tops. Access ramps or mechanical lifts provide the necessary access to the 
roofs. (Photos 6.12 and 6.13)

Automated parking systems
After placing the vehicle on a platform, the automated parking system will move the vehicle to 
available parking space somewhere in the structure. The vehicles can be moved horizontally 
and vertically in the system.  Parking spaces in this system will be smaller, because no 
one needs to get in or out of the vehicle and people do not park it themselves. It is entirely 
automatic and does not require any staff. Automated parking systems are also sometimes 
called:

Mechanical parking system

Semi-automated parking system
A semi-automated parking system uses a mechanical system to move vehicles to their parking 
space, only it needs a human action to work, either by the driver or by an attendant.
6.4.3	
Vehicles are moved in different way from ground level either under the ground or 
above and carried by lifts to different levels of MLCP instead of conventional manually driving 
on ramps.  The different types are:
	
(1)	
Stack Parking 
	
(2)	
Puzzle Parking 
	
(3)	
Tower Parking

Stack Parking 
In this system, two vehicles are parked one above the other and are adopted both under the 
ground and above, in order to provide more parking slots.  This system is electrically and 
mechanically driven. (Photo 6.14)
Photo 6.14  Stack Parking
(2)	
Puzzle Parking
This is fully automated and there will be one or two slots in the parking to move the vehicle to 
the vacant space.  This moves both horizontally and vertically.  This is jointly multi-level and 
above the ground. (Photos 6.15 and 6.16)

Rotary Parking 
This is mechanical parking with turn-table for narrow space.  The vehicles are driven on 
the turn-table and aligned in position.  Vehicles are then driven in to the vacant slot which 
positions at the ground level. (Photo 6.18)

 Parking Design for Differently Able People
In order to ensure universal accessibility, it is essential to provide appropriate parking facilities 
for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. Following guidelines will be adopted while 
designing parking for people with disabilities:
	
	
Sign with the international symbol of accessibility mounted high enough so it 
can be seen while a vehicle is parked in the space.
	
	
If the accessible route is located in front of the space, install wheel stops to 
keep vehicles from reducing width below 90 cms.
	
	
Boundary of the access aisle must be marked. The end may be a squared or 
curved shape.
	
	
Two parking spaces may share an access aisle.
	
	
For parking facilities of less than 50 cars, at least one accessible parking space 
should be provided in every parking facility.
	
	
For parking facilities of a maximum number of 400 spaces, accessible parking 
spaces should at least be provided in the ratio of 1:50.
	
	
For parking facilities of more than 400 spaces, at least 8 accessible parking 
spaces should be provided plus 1 space for each additional increment of 100 
cars over 400.

Dimensions for parking shall be as prescribed here below. The minimum width of parking 
space shall be 3.60 m. However, recommended width is 3.90 m .
 
Fig. 6.8 Width of Accessible Parking
	
	
Access aisle 1.20 m wide located between two ordinary parking spaces.
	
	
In case of indoor parking, the minimum height clearance is 2.40 m.
	
	
For angled parking spaces, the extra space at the end of a row can be used as 
a parking aisle for disabled persons. 
	
	
If a curb exists, curb ramps should be provided to link accessible parking spaces 
to accessible pathways.
Fig. 6.9 Common Access Aisle
If no curb exists, textured surface at least 0.60 m wide must separate the pathway from the 
vehicular area; or else bollards should be used. Pre-cast wheelstops can be used to create 
a passage of at least 0.90 m wide.
6.8	
Multi Use or Shared Parking          
	
(i)	
At least 50% and preferably 100% of the total parking facilities based on 



======================================================================


IRC:SP:12-2015

equivalent car space should be provided for any new/redevelopment/retrofit 
project. Plot area shall be provided as a Shared Parking facility.  Such facilities 
can be shared between different neighbouring uses which have different peak 
hours of demand. Every car shall have free access to exit units.
	
(ii)	
Shared parking locations should be integrated with the Parking Benefit District 
and be universally accessible by walk, Non Motorised Transport or Intermediate 
Public Transport Vehicles facilities.
	
(iii)	 Shared parking facilities may be identified as part of comprehensive 
redevelopment schemes prepared by the Govt. or private party.
	
(iv)	 ‘Unbundling’ of parking cost – The conventional method of including the price of 
parking in an overall lease increases the cost of housing/commercial properties, 
irrespective of whether the tenant/buyer owns a car.  In new projects, shared 
parking provisions would require that parking spaces are provided and leased/
sold separately (“unbundled”) from the rent or sale price of a property.
The cost of investment for different types of parking excluding land cost is estimated as 
below:
	
	
Conventional parking (Multilevel) : 32 m2/ECS : Rs. 4 – 6 lakh / ECS
	
	
Stack parking : 16 m2/Car/Rs. 1.5 lakh /ECS 
	
	
Fully automated : 16 m2/ECS : Rs. 8 – 10 lakh/ECS
The rates for parking must be based on land value and investment. Further the rates for 
surface & multilevel parking must be different.
6.9	
One of the major issues of parking of commercial vehicles due to restriction of their 
entry into the city limits resulting in parking of these vehicles within the Right of way of National 
and State highways (Photo 6.19). This can be approached by converting government land 
away from highway with approaches to and fro and parking vehicles in bye lay. The vehicles 
will be there till such time they are permitted their entry in city limits. Alternatively the goods 
can be shuttled to the cities in mini commercial vehicles.

6.11.2	
CBD is choked with new constructions and hardly there are lands for development 
except stray cases of pulling down old buildings and putting up new construction.
Roads are choked in CBD areas and On Street Parking is hardly available.  Widening roads 
for parking is ruled out as the acquisition of land and structures is expensive with protests / 
litigations from land owners.
Apart from providing park and ride facilities with reference to integration between the road 
and Metro rail/ rail transport systems, such facilities would also need to be provided to reduce 
the problem of parking on main arterial roads in the context of identified work and activity 
centers which may not be directly connected by the MRTS and to encourage use of public 
transport.
1.	
Park and ride facilities for private modes are to be provided only at terminal MRTS 
stations or major multimodal interchanges, not at other stations.
Photo-6.21 Metro Stations Under Construction with Facility for MLCP above the Station 
2.	
Park and ride facilities for bicycle users with convenient interchange at all Metro 
Rail Transport Service (MRTS) stations are a mandatory requirement at all stations. 
(Photo  6.21)
3.	
Park and ride facilities should be provided at border locations abutting highways and 
terminal MRTS/Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS)/Public Rapid Transport System 
(PRTS) stations, coupled with excellent public transport linkages to the city centre and 
various work centres. All will have unhindered exit and entry.
4.	
For special city level events, mandate ‘park-n-ride’ based parking management strategy 
can be adopted. Decentralized parking locations can be allocated for the event and 
mandate event-organizer to arrange for shuttle services from the nearest off-street 
parking facilities and Metro stations.

Drop and Ride
Drop and Ride is a designated area identified by sign board for parents picking up or dropping 
their children by circulation of vehicles, as well as people dropped at metro stations, malls 
and hospitals. The area is separate from the bus embarking/disembarking locations so that 
there is no conflict between two types of operations. In order to function this activity efficiently, 
following procedures need to be followed:
a.	
A safety supervisor or a designated staff from school shall provide supervision. 
b.	
Children embark and disembark from the passenger side of the vehicle only, so that 
they will not have to cross the driveway in front of traffic. 
c.	
Drivers shall remain in the vehicle. The safety supervisor and safety patrols will assist 
with the vehicle door. 
d.	
Vehicles stay in a single file line as they move to and from the Drop and Ride.

7. PARKING NORMS AND STANDARDS
Number of parking spaces required for different type of vehicles depends on the type of land use and socio-
economic characteristics of the population. Many cities have evolved norms for parking spaces to be provided 
in different type of buildings and made it mandatory through their bye laws. Table 7.1 shows recommended area 
requirements for parking in different type of cities.

8 ENFORCEMENT
On Street Enforcement of parking regulations is primarily the responsibility of Police.  As 
parking of vehicles is the sole responsibility of ULB’S, the enforcement responsibility can vest 
with respective ULB’s.  They can do it themselves or outsource to the appropriate agency. 
However, checking of on-street parking offences is tied with local police.
The services of traffic hosts and traffic wardens can be effectively utilized for orderly on-
street parking.  Traffic hosts 
are the people who had the 
task of addressing car-drivers 
who were looking for a parking 
space or intended to or parked 
illegally and to guide them to an 
available parking place, provide 
them with information if needed 
and in doing so prevent illegal 
parking and non-compliance to 
paid parking. This can prevent 
towing of vehicles parked in 
unauthorised manner resulting in 
waste of time and traffic snarls. 
Some cities have formed traffic 
Advisory Committee of representative of stakeholders and citizens to address traffic issues 
including parking. 
Suggested options to mitigate the parking problem are:
(i)	
Reduction in number of registered vehicles where family has already a car
(ii)	
Disposing off old one or paying premium rate for new one (additional)
(iii)	 Certification of availability of parking space inside their premises
(iv)	 Entry and exit to CBD area with premium rate (toll or monthly permits) to discourage 
use of private vehicles in CBD Area. 
(v)	
Planning for the commercial site for improving the access through improvement in public 
transport and capping parking supply. Capping can be done through actual physical 
restriction on further expansion of parking and also by pricing the parking high.
(vi)	  Increase in the penalty for illegal/wrong parking through Amendment Motor Vehicles 
Act 1988.
(vii)	 Introduction of electronics fines, so that enforcement can be improved and also the 
system of compounded offences can be introduced.

(Refer Para 3.13)
BEST PRACTICES OF PARKING POLICIES IN SOME ASIAN CITIES
1.	
Singapore
1.1.	
Vehicle-Related Taxes
The restraining vehicle ownership was first initiated in Singapore in October 1972, when the 
initial registration of a new car, was hiked from 15 to 25 percent of the open market value 
of the car. At the same time the import duty was also increased from 30 to 45 percent and 
annual road taxes were raised slightly for cars larger than 1000 cc and a sliding scale applied 
with higher road tax rates for larger cars. Over the next 18 years until 1990, the Annual 
Registration Fee (ARF) and the road taxes were increased at regular intervals.
1.2.	
Area Licensing 
Vehicles are charged a fee to enter the CBD of the city. This was started  in 1975 and there 
was modification for  a number of times since then. It had resulted in decrease in private car 
travel to the city centre. Parking policies were also directed towards the restraining private 
vehicle access to congested central locations. In 1975 a parking space surcharge tax was 
considered at a rate of S$20 per month per space within the CBD and S$10 in the close by 
areas beyond the CBD. 
1.3.	
Vehicle Quota Scheme (in Singapore)
In 1990 the introduction of the Vehicle Quota Scheme brought a major change in the method of 
restraining private vehicle ownership growth. Under this scheme, the issuance of Certificates 
of Entitlement (COEs) is made each month and bids are made for the limited number in each 
category of vehicles. The philosophy is that the vehicle fleet is allowed to increase only as 
fast as the road network, at approximately 3 percent per year.
The effect of restraint measures on the affordability of car ownership in Singapore over the 
years has been quite significant. 
2.	
Hong Kong
2.1.	
First Registration Tax (FRT) & Annual Vehicle License Fees (ALF) 
First Registration Tax (FRT), which is a purchase tax on the value of the vehicle, was hiked 
to 15 percent of the cost-insurance-freight value of cars and motorcycles. Apart from this, 
Annual Vehicle License Fees (ALF) were approximately made four times. These changes 
had brought the desired effect.

2.2.	
Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) 
The trial for ERP started from 1983 to 1985 and brought a great success, demonstrating 
a very high benefit-cost ratio. However, political concerns about personal privacy and the 
suspicion that this was simply a revenue-raising device prevented the implementation of the 
scheme.
3.	
Tokyo
3.1.	
Credit and Land-Market Policies
In Japan a number of government policies (especially credit and land-market policies) in 
the post-war era, resulted in restraint in private spending on both cars and urban sprawl. 
In the post-war era, the primary underlying reason for private vehicle restraint policies was 
concerned with Japan’s post-war national economic strategy. Under the set of policies known 
as the “Maruyu” system, the primary goal was to bring down the private consumption in order 
to maximise savings, investment and exports.  Some policies include as under:
	
High levels of car-related taxes 
	
Charges and duties in Japan 
	
Toll charges
	
Parking costs
3.2.	
Proof of Ownership of an Off-Street Car Parking Place 
In Tokyo, proof of ownership of an off-street car parking place is needed before a car can get 
registered (with the exception of very small cars of 550 cc or lower engine capacity).
3.3.	
High Parking Cost (in Tokyo)
High parking costs are partly related with extremely high property values in Tokyo and also 
due to the inherent shortage of parking space in the large inner area and even many suburban 
areas that were built up in the pre-car era. 
3.4.	
Tolls (in Tokyo)
Tolls are expensive on Japan’s expressway system, including Tokyo’s expressways, the 
“Shutoko”. 
4.	
Seoul
4.1.	
No-Drive Days (in Seoul)
Seoul made an experimentation with no-drive days, which in Seoul has been called the 
“10th day holiday” (“sibbuje”) system, whereby each vehicle will be off the roads for one

45
weekday out of ten according to license plate number. This was first experimented during the 
Seoul Olympics. 
4.2.	
Parking Restraint Policy 
Seoul did not have official parking restraint policy.   At present  the City Government 
demarcates  Seoul into three zones and sets different prices for public parking lots. 
Most expensive are the old CBD and six other major employment centres. In 1991, an 
increase in 100 per cent parking price in CBD resulted in the  reduction of the demand for 
CBD parking by 20-30 per cent.
4.3.	
Employer-Based Transport Demand Management Programs
Employer-Based Transport Demand Management Programs such as eliminating free 
employee parking, flexible work-hours, public transport incentives and car-pooling matching 
services have been attempted. Enterprises enjoy in receiving an incentive to participate 
through a rebate on their Traffic Impact Fee (which is levied on all building owners of over 
1,000 square metres of floor space. 
4.4.	
Congestion Toll
Seoul in November 1996 initiated a congestion toll on two tunnels beneath the Namsan 
Mountain (which is just to the south of the old CBD) in conjunction with new exclusive bus-
lanes. This has resulted in a reduction of traffic by 26%, with increase in average car speed 
in the tunnels, and an increase in the use of public transport. The number of passengers uses 
car pools of more than 3 persons, during rush hours, increased by 76%.
4.5.	
Other Restraint Policies in Seoul
Other restraint policies include acquisition taxes, high yearly ownership taxes, and subway 
Construction Bonds.  
In pursuit to the policy of public transport, Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong have also 
developed substantial mass transit systems which create a conducive environment for 
competing with private vehicles. They did this before motorization in each city had crossed 
150 private vehicles per 1000 persons. Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are in the transition 
of building mass transit systems. It is expected that both Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, 
motorization will have attained high levels by the time that substantial mass transit systems 
are likely to be in existence.
