1. INTRODUCTION
1
. 1
Due to industrialisation and rapid economic growth,
demand for electricity has risen tremendously. To meet this demand, a
number of coal based thermal power plants have been set up. At
present,
in India thermal power plants produce about 90 million
tonnes offly ash per annum, and hardly 1 3 per cent of it is utilised.
1 .2
When pulverised coal is burnt in the furnace of the
power stations, about 80 per cent of the ash produced is very fine in
nature. This part gets carried along with flue gases and is collected
by using either electro-static precipitator or cyclone precipitator.
This is called fly ash. The remaining ash sinters and falls down at
the bottom of the furnance. This is known as bottom ash. Fly ash
may be disposed in dry form (in ash mounds or through water slurry
in a pond. When fly ash and bottom ash are mixed and disposed in
the form of water slurry to ash ponds, it is called pond ash. For the
purpose of embankment construction either pond ash, bottom ash
or mound ash can be used. Fly ash being a very fine material is not
recommended for embankment construction. However,
it may be
noted that the term "fly ash" is commonly used as a generic term to
denote any type of coal ash. For the purpose of these guidelines the
term
fly ash would denote Pond Ash/Bottom Ash/Mound Ash,
which are to be used for embankment construction.
1 .3
Fly ash is causing environmental pollution, creating
health
hazards
and
requires
large
areas
of precious
land
for
disposal. Due to increasing concern for environmental protection
and growing awareness ofthe ill effects ofpollution, disposal ofash
generated
at thermal power plants has become an urgent and
challenging task. Fly ash can be utilised in many ways as shown
through extensive R&D efforts as well as field demonstration. But
bulk
utilisation
is
possible
in
the
field
of
civil
engineering
applications
especially
construction
of
road
embankments.
Typically, in developed urban and industrial areas, natural borrow
sources are scarce, expensive or inaccessible. The environmental
degradation caused due
to
the use of topsoil
for embankment
construction
is
very
high.
Moreover, many power
plants
are
situated
in urban
areas, and
therefore,
fly ash can provide an
environmentally preferable alternative to natural borrow soil.

======================================================================

======================================================================
|RC:SP:58-2001
1 .4.
The properties of fly ash vary depending upon type of
coal, its pulverisation and combustion techniques, their collection and
disposal systems, etc. Ash collected from the same ash pond may
exhibit different physical and engineering properties depending on point
of collection, depth, etc. Obviously, ash from two different thermal
power plants can be expected to have different properties. These factors
can be easily taken care during characterisation, design and quality
control operations during construction. In spite of variations in its
properties, fly ash possesses several desirable characteristics, such as,
lightweight, ease ofcompaction, faster rate ofconsolidation, etc. Also,
spreading and compaction of fly ash can be started much earlier in
comparison to soil after a rainfall. Fly ash would be a preferred material
for construction ofembankments over weak subsoil.
2. SCOPE
2. 1
.
These guidelines provide salient details regarding
design and construction ofroad embankments using fly ash. The Indian
Roads Congress (IRC) and Ministry ofRoad Transport & Highways
(M/o. RT4H) specifications for earthen embankments can be broadly
applied in general for construction of fly ash embankments. In case of
any deviations, these specifications will take precedence.
3. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
3.1.
The design of fly ash embankments is basically similar
to design of soil embankments. The design process for embankments
involves the following steps:
•
Site investigations
•
Characterisation of materials
•
Detailed design
The design ofembankment is an iterative process. It involves
developing conceptual plans, which satisfy site needs, design
4



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
requirements pertaining to slope stability, bearing capacity, settlement
and drainage. These conceptual designs are finalised based on the
engineering properties of fly ash and specific site conditions.
3.2.
Site Invesigations
The following information concerning the site and surrounding
areas must be collected:
•
Topography: The existing configuration of the
site and the
proposed developments, topographic information is essential for
determining fill volumes, surface drainage and overall site layout.
•
Hydrology: The nature of existing and potential development of
surface water and ground water conditions, flooding if expected.
•
Subsoil investigations: The nature and extent of soil and rock
strata, which influence the design, and performance of project.
For detailed procedure on carrying out site investigations,
1RC:36-1970 may be referred.
3.3.
Characterisation of Materials
The materials to be used in embankment construction should
be characterised to determine their physical and engineering properties.
In certain specific situations, chemical properties may be ofrelevance
as detailed in sections 3.3. 1 .8 to 3.3. 1
. 1 0. Suitability ofthe material
and design parameters are obtained through characterisation tests.
3.3.1.
Flyash
3.3. 1.1. The following information on the fly ash to be used,
should be made available for the Engineer's approval before
5



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
commencement ofwork:
1.
Particle size analysis of the material
1
2.
The maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content
(OMC) as per IS Heavy Compaction test (commonly known as
modified proctor test), and the graph of density plotted against
moisture content, for this test
2
.
3.3.1.2.
Once the Engineer has approved the above
information, it shall form the basis for compaction. The density of fly
ash is considerably lower than density ofmany types ofsoils. So, unlike
soils, fly ash with low MDD value should not be rejected for
using it as a fill material. However, in general, fly ash of density
lower than 0.9 gm/cc may not be suitable for embankment construction.
The design parameters should be rechecked, when fly ash of lower
densities is encountered.
3.3. 1 .3.
To determine engineering properties of fly ash, tests
shall be earned out in accordance with the procedures laid down in
IS:2720 (Method ofTests for Soils-relevant parts).
•
Shear strength parameters, for evaluation of the stability of proposed
slopes and the bearing capacity of foundations located on the
fill.
•
Compressibility characteristics,
for predicting the magnitude and
duration of the fill settlement.
•
Permeability and capillarity are required to assess seepage and
to
design drainage systems.
3.3.1.4.
The design analysis of an engineered
fill or
embankment requires the shear strength of fill material to be determined.
This is accomplished in the laboratory by conducting triaxial shear or
direct shear test. Shear strength is affected by sample density and
moisture content. To determine shear strength parameters
4 c and
1- IS:2720(Part4):1985
2- IS:2720(Part8): 1983
6



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
laboratory shear strength tests should be conducted on samples
compacted to densities equivalent to those expected to be attained in
the field.
3.3. 1 .5.
Fly ash gets consolidated at a faster rate and primary
consolidation is completed very quickly. So it has low compressibility
and shows negligible post construction settlements.
3.3.1 .6.
Liquefaction generally occurs when fly ash is deposited
under loose saturated condition during construction.There is very little
possibility ofliquefaction to occur, when fly ash is used in embankment
construction, as the material is compacted to maximum dry density at
optimum moisture content, i.e., under partially saturated condition. In
regions ofmoderate to high seismic activity, analysis ofembankment
stability should consider liquefaction potential ofthe ash fill. To avoid
the possibility ofany liquefaction to occur, the following precautions
maybe taken:
• Proper compaction of the fill material as per specifications
•
In case water table is high,
it should be lowered by providing
suitable drains or capillary cut-off
• By sandwiching ash between intermediate horizontal soil layers.
3.3.1 .7.
Typical values for different geotechnical properties
of fly ash are given in Table
1 for guidance. In general fly ash with
properties as given
in Table
1
are acceptable
for embankment
construction.

3.3.1.8.
The chemical characteristics of fly ash, which need
to be evaluated, are pozzolanic property, leachability and self-
handening
characteristics. The pozzolanic property of fly ash
would be of importance if stabilisers,
like, lime are used. Self-
hardening property of bituminous coal ashes is insignificant. Fly
ash to be used as
fill material should not have soluble sulphate
content exceeding
1 .9 gm (expressed as S0 3 ) per litre when tested
according to BS: 1377 Test 10 but using a 2:1 water-soil ratio.

3.3.1.9.
The primary environmental concern regarding use of
fly ash for embankments would be contamination ofground and surface
water due to heavy metal leaching. But it may be noted that most fly
ashes are relatively inert. Moreover, coal used in Indian thermal power
plants have high ash content. As a result, enrichment ofheavy metals is
lower compared to fly ash produced by thermal power plants abroad.
Studies have shown that even though constituents in fly ash particle
may dissolve initially but retention by weathered fly ash residues reduces
the possibility oftheir migration into ground water.
3.3.1.10. The leaching problem can be minimised by controlling
the amount ofwater, which infiltrates into fly ash embankment. Normally,
percolation ofwater into the fly ash core will be minimum when sides
and top are protected using good earth. Further, by providing
impervious wearing course to the pavement constructed over the
embankment seepage can be minimised. Side slopes should be properly
benched and protected with soil cover with vegetation or soil cover
with stone pitching. Monitoring of fly ash embankments has indicated
that relatively little water tends to percolate through the complete
embankment. Even in such a case, the alkaline nature of the fly
ash-water solution restricts heavy metal leaching.
3.3.2.
Earth cover
: The fly ash embankments should be
covered on the sides and top by soil to prevent erosion of ash. Good
earth suitable for embankment construction can be adopted as cover
material for fly ash embankments. Gravel may be used to construct
granular cut-off at the bottom. These materials are to be tested as per
MOST Specifications for fill materials used in embankment construction.
The soil used for cover should not have maximum dry density less than
1 .52 gm/cc when height ofembankment is upto 3 m and in areas not
subjected to extensive flooding, otherwise the maximum dry density of
cover soil should not be less than
1 .6 gm/cc when tested according to
IS:2720(Part 8)- 1983. Subgrade/earthen shoulder material should
9



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
have minimum compacted dry density of 1 .75 gm/cc when tested
according to IS: 2720 (Part 8)- 1983. Plasticity index of cover soil
should be between 5 to 9 per cent when tested according to IS: 2720
(Part 5)- 1985. Chemical analysis or determination of deleterious
constituents would be necessary in salt-infested areas or when presence
of salts is suspected in the borrow material. Expansive soils should not
be used for construction ofcover, unless it is properly stabilised using lime.
3.4.
Detailed Design
3.4.1.
The detailed design includes analysis for establishing
structural features ofthe embankment at the selected site. The design
of fly ash embankment is similar to earthen embankments. However,
special emphasis is required with respect to provision ofearth cover
for fly ash embankments since ash is easily erodable. The thickness of
side cover (measured horizontally) would be typically in the range of 1
to 3 m. Height and side slope ofthe embankment govern the thickness
ofearth cover. For embankment upto 3 m height, in general, the earth
cover thickness ofabout 1 m would be sufficient. For high embankments
and for embankments to be constructed in flood prone areas, the cover
thickness may be increased. The side cover should be regarded as a
part of embankment for design analysis. The embankment would,
therefore, be designed as a composite structure with fly ash in the core
and earth cover on the sides. Well-compacted fly ash attains sufficient
shear strength so that the embankment can be constructed with 2
horizontal to
1 vertical side slope. This should be confirmed through
stability analysis for each project.
3.4.2.
The three most common types offailure ofembankment
are toe failure (occurring when foundation soil is stronger than fill
material), slope failure (occurring in a layered embankment when a
strong layer limits the extent ofdevelopment of failure surface) and
base failure (occurring when the foundation soils beneath the base of
the embankment have low strengths). Regardless ofthe type of failure,
the basic principle of stability analysis is to compare those factors
contributing to instability to those resisting a failure. The design methods
10



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
use limit equilibrium method for stability analysis ofembankment. In
this method, stability is considered along a failure surface. Generally in
the slip circle method failure plane is assumed to be circular. A particular
critical circle gives the minimum factor of safety. For more details on
stability analysis, IRC:75-1 979 may be referred.
3.4.3.
Calculation of factor ofsafety ofdifferent circles until
the critical circle is located is a very time consuming process. Computer
programme provides quick solution. Using a computer, different types
of embankment cross-section can be quickly analysed and proper
cross-section can be selected. The software for stability analysis of
high embankments available with the Indian Roads Congress, approved
by Ministry ofRoad Transport & Highways, Government of India,
can be used for design of fly ash embankments. This computer
programme is based on the 'Simplified Bishop Method'. The sliding
earth mass is divided into a number of slices. The factor of safety is
determined by comparing a sum ofactivating moments and resisting
moments ofall the slices.
3.4.4.
It
is recommended
that
factor of safety
for
embankments constructed using fly ash should not be less than
1 .25
under normal serviceability conditions and when checked for worst
combination under seismic and saturated conditions, it should not be
less than 1.0.
3.4.5.
Intermediate soil layers are often provided in the fly
ash embankment for ease ofconstruction, to facilitate compaction of
ash and to provide adequate confinement. Such layers minimise
liquefaction potential also. Embankment with intermediate soil layers
can be adopted in case height ofthe embankment is more than 3 m.
The compacted thickness of intermediate soil layers shall not be less
than 200 mm. One or more layers shall be constructed depending
upon the design requirements. The vertical distance between such layers
may vary from
1 .5 to 3 m. The top 0.5 m ofembankment should be
constructed using selected earth to form the subgrade for the road
pavement. Typical cross-sections of fly ash embankment with and
without intermediate soil layers are shown in Figs.
1 and 2 respectively.

3.4.6.
Properly benched and graded slopes prevent the
erosion of fly ash particles. Fly ash embankments should be benched
at 4 to 6 m vertical intervals to drain surface water run-off to the ends
of the embankment, rather than allowing full volume ofthe run-offto
travel down the face of the embankment to the toe. Run-off from
pavement surfaces should be collected and discharged into proper
drainage system. For more details regarding drainage aspects,
IRC:SP: 50-1 999 may be referred.
4. CONSTRUCTION OF FLY ASH
EMBANKMENTS
4. 1
.
Clearing and Grubbing
This work consists ofcutting, removing and disposal of trees,
bushes, shrubs, roots, grass, rubbish, etc., from the alignment and within
the area of road land which will accommodate road embankment,
drains, and such other areas as specified on the drawi
lgs. During clearing
and grubbing, the contractor shall take adequate precautions against
soil erosion, water pollution, etc. All trees, stumps, etc., falling within
fill area should be cut to atleast 500 mm below ground level and pits
shall be filled with suitable material and compacted thoroughly so as to
make the surface at these points conform to the surrounding area.
4.2.
Stripping and Storing ofTop Soil
When constructing embankment using fly ash, the top soil from
all areas to be covered by the embankment foundation should be
stripped to specified depth not exceeding
1 50 mm and stored in stock
piles of height not exceeding 2 m, for use in covering the fly ash
embankment slopes, cut slopes and other disturbed areas where
re-vegetation is desired. Top soil should not be unnecessarily trafficked
either before strippingor when in stockpiles. Also, these shall not be
surcharged or otherwise loaded and multiple handling should be kept
to minimum.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
4.3.
Setting Out
After the site has been cleared, the limits ofembankment should
be set out true to lines, curves, slopes, grades and sections as shown
on the drawings. The limits ofthe embankment should be marked by
fixing batter pegs on both sides at regular intervals as guides before
commencing the construction. The embankment should be built
sufficiently wider than the design dimensions so that surplus material
may be trimmed, ensuring that the remaining material is ofthe desired
density and in position specified, and conforms to the specified slopes.
Bench marks and other stakes should be maintained as long as in the
opinion of the engineer, they are required for the work.
4.4.
Dewatering
Ifthe foundation ofthe embankment is in an area with stagnant
water, and in the opinion of the Engineer
it is feasible to remove
it,
the same should be removed by pumping or any other means as directed
by the Engineer, and the area ofthe embankment foundation should be
kept dry. Care should be taken to discharge the drained water so as
not
to cause damage to works, crops or any other property.
Construction ofembankments underwater logged conditions shall be
governed by provisions of IRC:36- 1970.
4.5.
Compacting the Ground Supporting Embankment
4.5.1.
Where necessary, the original ground should be
levelled, scarified, mixed with water and then compacted by rolling so
as to achieve minimum 97 percent ofMDD determined as per IS:2720
(Part 8)- 1 983 for the foundation soil. At locations where water table
is high and the soil has potential for rapid and relatively great migration
ofmoisture by capillarity, a granular layer, impervious membrane or a
barrier ofapproved medium shall be inserted so that moisture is not
able to rise to the subgrade level. Sand blanket ofadequate thickness
over full width ofembankment can be adopted as an effective capillary
cut-off. Medium grained sand can be used for this purpose. This will
provide a working platfonn for the construction of fly ash fill and function
14



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
as
capillary
cut-off.
Provision
of geotextile
separating
layer
between drainage blanket and
fly ash
will help the drainage
blanket to function efficiently and prevent intrusion of fly ash into
drainage blanket. Drainage blanket can be nominally compacted
with
or without
vibration. Bottom ash can
also be used
for
construction of drainage blanket.
Its grain
size distribution
is
generally compatible with the grain size distribution of medium
grained sand. Further guidance regarding capillary cut off design
and
its
provision
can
be
obtained
from
IRC:34-1970,
'Recommendations
for Road
Construction
in Water Logged
Areas'.
4.5.2.
Where so directed by the Engineer, any unsuitable
material
occurring
in
the
embankment
foundation
shall
be
removed and replaced by approved materials laid in layers, to the
required
degree
of
compaction. Any
foundation
treatment
specified for embankment especially high embankments, resting
on suspect foundations as revealed by borehole logs should be
carried out in a suitable manner to the depth required. The depth of
boreholes should be related to the height of embankment to be
constucted.
4.6
Handling and Transportation ofFly Ash
4.6.1
Pond
ash
is
typically
delivered
to
the
site
in
covered dumper truck to minimize loss of moisture and dusting.
Pond ash generally contains enough moisture to prevent dusting
and may even contain excess moisture to create road spillage
during transport. In such cases, periodic inspection and lifting of
ash from relatively dry areas ofthe pond would be needed.
15



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
4.6.2.
The fly ash may require on site temporary stockpiling
if the rate at which the ash is supplied to the project site is more than
the contractor's demand for an efficient rate ofplacement. Such cases
should be avoided to the extent possible, and in case stockpiling at site
is inevitable, adequate precautions should be taken to prevent dusting
by spraying water on stockpiles at regular intervals. Otherwise, the
surface of the fly ash stockpile may be covered with tarpaulins or a thin
layer of soil or other granular material not subject to dusting. Traffic
movements may be restricted to those areas which are kept moist, to
prevent tyres ofpassing vehicles dispersing ash into the air.
4.7.
Spreading and Compaction
4.7. 1
.
The side soil cover ofrequired width shall be provided
along with the core and mechanically compacted as the embankment
progresses upwards. The addition of side cover subsequent to the
construction ofthe core is prohibited. The fill material should be spread
by mechanical means, finished by motor grader. The motor grader
blade shall have hydraulic control so as to achieve the speci fied slope
and grade. The most efficient lift thickness is a function of roller weight
and vibratory energy. Smaller vibratory rollers with dead weights of
10 to 15 kN perform well on loose layer thickness of the order of
1 00-1 50 mm. Medium weight vibratory rollers with dead weights in
the range 60- 1 00 kN, provide satisfactory compaction for loose layer
thickness ofabout 250 mm. When vibratory roller ofdead weight 80-
1 00 kN are used, loose layer thickness upto 400 mm can be adopted
if site trials as explained in section 4.7.3 show satisfactory compaction.
When compaction is earned out using only static roller of80- 1 00 kN
weight, loose layer thickness shall not exceed 200 mm. The cover soil
and fly ash should be laid simultaneously before compaction, to ensure
confinement of fly ash. Clods or hard lumps in cover soil shall be broken
to have a maximum size of50 mm.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
4.7.2.
Moisture content ofthe fill material shall be checked
at the site of placement prior to commencement of compaction.
Moisture content of fly ash laid for compaction shall normally vary
from OMC (determined as per IS: 2720 (Part 8): 1983 to OMC ± 2
per cent. The moisture content limits can be varied depending on the
weather conditions, by the Engineer-in-charge, provided specified
compaction is achieved as revealed through actual site trials and there
is no dust problem. It may be noted that grain shape and particle size
of fly ash make the upper layers difficult to compact. At moisture
contents higher than the appropriate range, fly ash may liquefy and
would be difficult to handle and compact. Moisture content ofcover
soil shall be maintained at its OMC. Where water is required to be
added to the fill material, it shall be sprinkled from a water tanker fitted
with a sprinkler capable of applying water uniformly without any
flooding. The water shall be mixed thoroughly by blading, discing or
harrowing or by suitable means until uniform moisture content is obtained
throughout the depth of the layer. If the material delivered to the
construction site is too wet, it shall be dried by aeration and exposure
to sun, till the moisture content is acceptable for compaction.
4.7.3.
Fly ash can be compacted using vibratory or static
rollers. Towed or self-propelled vibratory rollers are recommended.
Regardless ofthe equipment used, fly ash must be compacted as early
as possible after spreading. The contractor shall demonstrate the
efficacy ofthe equipment he intends to use by carrying out compaction
trials. The procedure to be adopted for these site trials shall be first
submitted to the Engineer for approval. The use oftest strips to develop
compaction method specifications (optimum compaction procedure
to satisfy density requirements) for the construction ofthe embankment
is advisable. Typically several test areas are developed where a series
of compaction trials can be conducted. In such trials, usually one
parameter (such as, lift thickness, moisture content, etc.) is varied at a
time while the others remain constant.
17



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
4.7.4.
Each layer of fly ash shall be thoroughly compacted to
the specified density. When vibratory roller is adopted for compaction,
two passes without vibration followed by 5 to 8 passes with vibration
would be sufficient to compact individual layers. Mass per metre width
of roller is recommended to be 2300-2900 kg/m and frequency range
1 800-2200 rpm. The construction of fly ash core and earth cover on
the sides should proceed simultaneously.
4.7.5.
Each compacted layer shall be finished parallel to the
final cross-section of the embankment. The following end product
specifications as given in Table 2, have been suggested for construction
of fly ash embankments.
Table 2.
Specificationsfor Compaction
Minimum dry density after compaction as
percentage ofMDD IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1983
95%
Minimum dry density after compaction when used in
bridge abutments - for embankment length equal to
1 .5
times the height of the embankment
100%
4.7.6.
At locations where compaction ofthe ash fill/earth is
impracticable using rollers, such as, fill portions adjacent to masonry
structures/steep abutments or around concrete drainpipes embedded
in embankment, hand held vibratory tampers shall be used for
compaction. The required moisture contents and compaction
requirements shall be same, as for the rest ofthe embankment, however,
compacted layer thickness should not exceed 100 mm in such cases.
4.7.7. The Engineer may permit measurement of field density
according to agreed procedure. Subsequent layers shall be placed only
after the finished layer has been tested for its density requirements.
The contractor shall maintain record of all such tests. When density
neasurements reveal any soft areas in the embankment, further
18



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
compaction shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer. In spite of
that ifspecified degree ofcompaction is not achieved, the material in
the soft areas shall be removed and replaced by approved material,
moisture content brought to permissible limits and recompacted to the
required density.
4.7.8. Embankment shall be constructed evenly over their full
width and the contractor shall control and direct construction plant
and other vehicular traffic uniformly across the width. Damage by the
construction plant or other vehicular traffic shall be made good by the
contractor with material having the same characteristics and strength
as it had before it was damaged. Embankments shall not be constructed
with steeper side slopes or to greater width than those shown in the
drawings. Whenever embankment construction is to be taken up against
the face of natural slope or sloping earth works face including
embankments, cuttings, and excavations which are steeper than
1 :4
(Vertical:Horizontal), such faces shall be benched immediately before
placing the subsequent fill. A less permeable capping layer ofselected
earth should be constructed on the top of fly ash embankment, which
would form the subgrade for the road pavement. The thickness ofthis
layer should not be less than 500 mm.
4.8.
Precautions Against Corrosion
4.8. 1
.
The sulphate content in fly ash should be within the
limits specified in section 3.3. 1 .8. The sulphate content of fly ash may
sometimes cause concern about possibility ofsulphate attack on adjacent
concrete structures. While no reported failures have occurred, certain
precautions are advisable, in case sulphate attack on concrete structures
is suspected. These consist of painting the adjacent concrete faces
with bitumen or compounds, which offer moisture protection to
concrete. Corrosion of cast iron, lead, copper, PVC or terra cotta
19



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:SP:58-2001
pipes would be minimum due to contact with fly ash. There have been
reported failure ofaluminium conduit materials buried in fly ash. If
protection ofpipes is necessary, polythene sheeting, bituminous coating
or embedding and backfilling with inert materials, like, suitable soil of
minimum cushion thickness of500 mm shall be adequate.
4.8.2.
Where signi ficant volumes ofseepage are encountered,
pipes should be used to drain the water out ofthe embankment area.
Perforated pipe is usually placed in the vicinity ofseep. One-third solid
wall pipe with two-third slotted portion can be used to drain the water
out ofembankment area. PVC or ABC pipe materials are preferred
because oftheir long-term performance. Analysis should be perfonned
to confirm that they provide adequate wall strength to support the
expected embankment loads. To prevent the internal erosion ofthe fill,
filter protection should be provided around the pipes.
4.9.
Finishing Operations
Finishing operations shall include the work of shaping and
dressing the shoulders/verge/road bed and side slopes to conform to
the alignment, levels, cross-sections and dimensions shown on the
drawing or as directed by the Engineer subject to the tolerance. Both
upper and lower ends of side slopes shall be rounded off to improve
appearance and to merge the embankment with the adjacent terrain.
In case turfing is proposed, top soil should be provided so that after
seeding, a dense cover can develop. The depth oftop soil should be
sufficient to sustain plant growth, the usual thickness being 75 to
1 00
mm. Slopes shall be roughened and moistened slightly before the
application of top
soil
in order to provide satisfactory bond.
Embankments constructed in flood prone areas should be protected
by stone pitching as per the provisions ofIRC:89-1 985.

5. QUALITY CONTROL
5.1
.
Quality of compacted material shall be controlled
through periodic checks on the compaction process or the end product,
singly or in combination as directed. The end product must conform
to the specifications.
5.2.
Control Test on Borrow Material
5.2.1.
If fly ash from more than one source is being used at
the project site, monitoring must be done to identify the ash type being
placed. The tests required to be conducted on fly ash to be used as
borrow material for embankment are indicated below. The frequency
of testing indicated refers to the minimum number of tests to be
conducted. The rate oftesting must be stepped up as found necessary,
depending on the compaction methods employed at the project.
•
IS Heavy Compaction Test: At the rate of 2 tests per every
3000 m
3 of ash, as per IS:2720 (Part 8)- 1 983
,
•
Moisture Content: One test for every 250 m
3 of ash, as per
IS:2720(Part2)-1973.
5.2.2.
The samples collected for testing moisture content
should be representative ofthe material being placed. Because fly ash
may air dry relatively rapidly, samples should not be taken from the
surface ofthe lift, but should represent the overall moisture content.
5.3.
Analysis and Acceptance of Density Results
5.3. 1
. Control shall be exercised on each layer by taking at
least one measurement of density for each 1000 square metres of
compacted area, or closer as required to yield the minimum number of
test results for evaluating a day's work on statistical basis. The
determination of density shall be
in accordance with IS:2720
(Part 28)- 1974. Test locations shall be chosen by random sampling
technique. The number of tests to be conducted and acceptance criteria
shall be as outlined in MOST Specifications for Road and Bridge Works,
Section 900.
