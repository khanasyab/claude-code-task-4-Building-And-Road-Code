PREFACE  TO  THE  FIFTH  REVISION
This edition of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works marks the Fifth Revision. In 
the last decade and a half, significant developments have taken place in the highways 
sector. The massive National Highways Development Projects (NHDP) undertaken by the 
Government of India is in progress involving execution of a large number of high value road 
projects. These require adoption of latest international practices so as to achieve technical 
execellence and the best quality. Concrete bridges have also undergone major changes with 
deveopment of new structural forms, new methods of computer based analysis and design 
and development of high strength materials, IRC:112 for concrete bridges based on the limit 
state method has come into force. Over the past few years, many IRC codes have also been 
completely revised necessitating extensive changes in the Ministry’s specifications for road 
and bridge works.
Some of the important additions in this revision of Specifications for Road and Bridge Works 
cover stone mastic asphalt, microsurfacing, sand asphalt base course, prefabricated vertical 
drains (PVD), natural geo textiles, geo cells for use in base and sub base in pavement 
and slope protection, variable message sign boards, soil nailing, cold applied retro-reflective 
paints, audible and vibratory pavement markings, solar powered road markers, traffic 
control & safety devices in construction zone, traffic impact attenuators and advance traffic 
management system. Some of the new areas covered in bridges include high performance 
concrete, HDPE sheathings, Pot-PTFE bearings, jack down method of well sinking, dynamic 
testing of piles and mechanically woven wire crates for gabions.
The Fifth Revision of the Specifications for Road and Bridge Works is the result of the 
concerted efforts of the officers of the Roads Wing and other professionals who contributed 
to the drafting of this document. I wish to express my gratitude to all of them and the Indian 
Roads Congress for undertaking the assignment of bringing out this publication.
Feedback and suggestion for further improvement would be welcome from users of this 
edition.

Passage of Traffic along a Part of the Existing Carriageway under 
Improvement
For widening/strengthening existing carriageway where part width of the existing carriageway 
is proposed to be used for passage of traffic, treated shoulders shall be provided on the side on 
which work is not in progress. The treatment to the shoulder shall consist of providing at least 
150 mm thick granular (Wet Mix Macadam/Water Bound Macadam) base course covered 
with bituminous surface dressing in a width of at least 1.5 m and the treated shoulder shall 
be maintained throughout the period during which traffic uses the same to the satisfaction 
of the Engineer. The continuous length, in which such work shall be carried out, would be 
limited normally to 500 m at a place. However, where work is allowed by the Engineer in 
longer stretches passing places at least 20 m long with additional paved width of 2.5 m shall 
be provided at every 0.5 km interval.

In case of eccentric widening of existing two-lane to four-lane, the additional two-lanes would 
be constructed first and the traffic diverted to it and only thereafter the required treatment to 
the existing carriageway would be carried out. In case of concentric widening, stipulations as 
in paragraph above shall apply.
After the works are completed, with the approval of the Engineer, the treated shoulder 
shall be dismantled, the debris disposed of and the area cleared as per the direction of the 
Engineer.
112.3	
Passage of Traffic along a Temporary Diversion
In stretches where it is not possible to pass the traffic on part width of the carriageway, a 
temporary diversion shall be constructed with 7 m carriageway and 2.5 m earthen shoulders 
on each side (total width of roadway 12 m) with the following provision for road crust in the

The location of such stretch, alignment and longitudinal section of diversion including junctions 
and temporary cross drainage provision shall be as approved by the Engineer.
112.4	
Traffic Safety and Control
The Contractor shall take all necessary measures for the safety of traffic during construction 
and provide, erect and maintain such barricades, including signs, marking, flags, lights and 
flagmen as per the traffic management plan submitted by the Contractor and approved by 
the Engineer, referred to in Sub-Section 112.1. Before taking up any construction, an agreed 
phased programme for the diversion of traffic on the highway shall be drawn up in consultation 
with the Engineer.
All construction equipment working or parked on or within the traffic lanes or shoulders under 
“Traffic maintained” conditions shall be equipped with flashing yellow beacons.
The Contractor shall conduct all operations to minimize any drop-offs (abrupt changes in 
roadway) exposed to traffic. Drop-offs in the travelled way shall be protected by a wedge 
of compacted stable material capable of carrying traffic (the wedge being 1 vertical to 4 
horizontal or flatter).

General
Section 100
21
The Engineer shall authorize other methods, to protect drop-offs when conditions do not 
allow a wedge of compacted, stable material.
Warning signs, barricades, warning lights, and all other traffic control devices shall not 
be removed if the hazard has not been eliminated. Only upon receipt of specific written 
authorization from the Engineer, the Contractor may remove or cease to maintain warning 
signs, barricades, warning lights, and all other traffic control devices.
The barricades erected on either side of the carriageway/portion of the carriageway closed to 
traffic, shall be of strong design to resist violation, and painted with alternate black and white 
stripes. Red lanterns or warning lights of similar type shall be mounted on the barricades at 
night and kept lit throughout from sunset to sunrise.
At the points where traffic is to deviate from its normal path (whether on temporary diversion 
or part width of the carriageway) the channel for traffic shall be clearly marked with the aid of 
pavement markings, painted drums or a similar device to the directions of the Engineer. At 
night, the passage shall be delineated with lanterns or other suitable light source including 
solar energy bulbs.
One-way traffic operation shall be established whenever the traffic is to be passed over part of 
the carriageway inadequate for two-lane traffic. This shall be done with the help of temporary 
traffic signals or flagmen kept positioned on opposite sides during all hours. For regulation of 
traffic, the flagmen shall be equipped with red and green flags and lanterns/lights.
On both sides, suitable regulatory/warning signs as approved by the Engineer shall be 
installed for the guidance of road users. On each approach, at least two signs shall be put 
up, one close to the point where transition of carriageway begins and the other 120 m away. 
The signs shall be of approved design and of reflective type, as directed by the Engineer.
112.5	
Maintenance of Diversions and Traffic Control Devices
Signs, lights, barriers and other traffic control devices, adequate lighting and other 
arrangements, as well as the riding surface of diversions and treated shoulders shall be 
maintained in a satisfactory condition till such time they are required and as directed by the 
Engineer. The temporary travelled way shall be kept free of dust by frequent applications of 
water, if necessary.
112.6	
Measurements for Payment and Rate
All arrangements, as contained in this Section 112 for safety of road users, during construction 
including provision of temporary diversions/temporary cross drainage structures/treated 
shoulders shall be measured and paid as per the BOQ. However their maintenance, 
dismantling and clearing debris shall be considered as incidental to the Works and shall not 
be paid separately.

GENERAL RULES FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF WORKS FOR 
PAYMENT
113.1	
General
All measurements shall be made in the metric system. Different items of work shall be 
measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in the relevant Sections read in 
conjunction with the General Conditions of Contract. The same shall not, however, apply in 
the case of lumpsum contracts.
All measurements and computations, unless otherwise indicated, shall be carried nearest to 
the following limits:
	
i)	
length and width	
	
	
	
	
10 mm
	
ii)	
height, depth or thickness of
	
a)	
earthwork, subgrade,	
	
	
5 mm
	
b)	
sub-bases, bases, surfacing	
	
5 mm
	
iii)	
structural members	
	
	
	
2.5 mm
	
iv)	
areas	
	
	
	
	
	
0.01 sq.m
	
v)	
volume	
	
	
	
	
	
0.01 cu.m
In recording dimensions of work, the sequence of length, width and height or depth or 
thickness shall be followed.
113.2	
Measurement of Lead for Materials
Where lead is specified in the Contract for construction materials, the same shall be measured 
as described hereunder:
Lead shall be measured over the shortest practicable route and not the one actually taken 
and the decision of the Engineer in this regard shall be taken as final. Distances upto and 
including 100 m shall be measured in units of 50 m, exceeding 100 m but not exceeding 1 km 
in units of 100 m and exceeding 1 km in units of 500 m, the half and greater than half of the 
unit shall be reckoned as one and less than half of the unit ignored. In this regard, the source 
of the material shall be divided into suitable blocks and for each block, the distance from the 
centre of placing pertaining to that block shall be taken as the lead distance.
113.3	
Measurement of Pavement Thickness for Payment on Volume Basis 
The finished thickness of sub-bases, base and bituminous layers and concrete courses to be 



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 903
======================================================================
General
Section 100
23
paid on volume basis shall be computed in the following manner:
Levels shall be taken before and after construction, at the grid of points 10 m centre-to-centre 
longitudinally in straight reaches and 5 m centre-to-centre at curves. Normally, on two-lane 
roads, the levels shall be taken at four positions transversely, at 0.75 m and 2.75 m from 
either edge of the carriageway and on single-lane roads, these shall be taken at two positions 
transversely, being at 1.25 m from either edge of the carriageway. For multi-lane roads, levels 
shall be taken at two positions transversely for each lane. The transverse position for levels 
shall be 0.75 m from either edge of the carriageway and the remaining locations shall be at 
equi-distance in the balance portion of carriageway. For paved shoulder an additional level 
shall be taken at the centre of the shoulder.
Suitable references for the transverse grid lines should be left in the form of embedded 
bricks on both ends or by other means so that it is possible to locate the grid points for level 
measurements after each successive course is laid.
For pavement courses laid only over widening portions, at least one line of levels shall be 
taken on each strip of widening, or more depending on the width of widening as decided by 
the Engineer.
Notwithstanding the above, the measurements may be taken at closer intervals also, if so 
desired by the Engineer, the need for which may arise particularly in the case of estimation 
of the volume of the material for profile corrective course (levelling course). The average 
thickness of the pavement course in any area shall be the arithmetic mean of the difference 
of levels before and after construction at all the grid points falling in that area, provided that 
the thickness of finished work shall be limited to those shown on the drawings or approved 
by the engineer in writing.
As supplement to level measurements, the Engineer shall have the option to take cores/
make holes to check the depth of construction. The holes made and the portions cut for 
taking cores shall be made good by the Contractor by laying fresh mix/material including 
compacting as required at his-own cost immediately after the measurements are recorded.
113.4	
Checking of Pavement Thickness for Payment on Area Basis
Where payment for any bituminous course in Section 500 is allowed to be made on the area 
basis, the Engineer may have its thickness checked with the help of a suitable penetration 
gauge at regular intervals or other means as he may decide.
113.5	
Measurement of Bituminous Courses for Payment on Weight Basis
Plant-mixed bituminous materials for pavement courses, where specifically designated in the 
contract to be paid on weight basis, shall be weighed on accurate scales approved by the 
Engineer. Approved scales shall mean scales that are of size, capacity, kind and type suitable 
for the weighing to be done, and these shall be properly installed and maintained. Prior to 



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 903
======================================================================
Section 100
General
24
the use of the scales and as frequently thereafter as the Engineer may deem necessary to 
ensure accuracy, the scales shall be checked and approved by the Engineer, or the Engineer 
may direct the Contractor to have the scales checked by other competent agency at the cost 
of the Contractor.
Location of the scales shall be as designated by the Engineer. Trucks used for hauling the 
material to be weighed shall be weighed empty daily at such times as the Engineer directs, 
and each truck shall bear a plainly legible identification mark.
For materials specified to be measured by weight, the Engineer will have the option to make 
measurements of the finished work by volume in accordance with Section 113.3 and such 
volumes shall be converted into weight for payment purposes. The factor for conversion from 
volume measurement to weight measurement shall be computed from the representative 
density of the compacted material at site determined at locations approved by the Engineer.
114

CLEARING  AND  GRUBBING
201.1	
Scope
This work shall consist of cutting, removing and disposing of all materials such as trees, 
bushes, shrubs, stumps, roots, grass, weeds, rubbish, top organic soil, etc. to an average 
depth of 150 mm in thickness, which in the opinion of the Engineer are unsuitable for 
incorporation in the works, from the area of road land containing road embankment, drains, 
cross-drainage structures and such other areas as may be specified on the drawings or by 
the Engineer. It shall include necessary excavation, backfilling of pits resulting from uprooting 
of trees and stumps to required compaction, handling, salvaging, and disposal of cleared 
materials with all leads and lifts. Clearing and grubbing shall be performed in advance of 
earthwork operations and in accordance with the requirements of these Specifications.
201.2	
Preservation of Property/Amenities
Roadside trees, shrubs, any other plants, pole lines, fences, signs, monuments, buildings, 
pipelines, sewers and all highway facilities within or adjacent to the highway which are not 
to be disturbed shall be protected from injury or damage. The Contractor shall provide and 
install at his own cost, suitable safeguards approved by the Engineer for this purpose.
During clearing and grubbing, the Contractor shall take all adequate precautions against soil 
erosion, water pollution, etc., and where required, undertake additional works to that effect 
vide Clause 306. Before start of operations, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer for 
approval, his work plan including the procedure to be followed for disposal of waste materials, 
etc., and the schedules for carrying out temporary and permanent erosion control works as 
stipulated in Clause 306.3.
201.3	
Methods, Tools and Equipment
Only such methods, tools and equipment as are approved by the Engineer and which will 
not affect any property to be preserved shall be adopted for the Work. If the area has thick 
vegetation/roots/trees, a crawler or pneumatic tyred dozer of adequate capacity may be used 
for clearance purposes. The dozer shall have ripper attachments for removal of tree stumps. 
All trees, stumps, etc., falling within excavation and fill lines shall be cut to such depth below 
ground level that in no case these fall within 500 mm of the bottom of the subgrade. Also, 
all vegetation such as roots, under-growth, grass and other deleterious matter unsuitable 
for incorporation in the embankment/subgrade shall be removed between fill lines to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer. All branches of trees extending above the roadway shall be 
trimmed as directed by the Engineer.
All excavations below the general ground level arising out of the removal of trees, stumps, 
etc., shall be filled with suitable material and compacted thoroughly so as to make the surface 
at these points conform to the surrounding area.

removal of their stumps, including removal of stumps upto 300 mm in girth left over after 
trees have been cut by any other agency, and trimming of branches of trees extending above 
the roadway and backfilling to the required compaction shall be considered incidental to the 
clearing and grubbing operations. Clearing and grubbing of borrow areas shall be deemed 
to be a part of works preparatory to embankment construction and shall be deemed to have 
been included in the rates quoted for the embankment construction item and no separate 
payment shall be made for the same.
Ground levels shall be taken prior to and after clearing and grubbing. Levels taken prior to 
clearing and grubbing shall be the base level and will be accordingly used for assessing the 
depth of clearing and grubbing and computation of quantity of any unsuitable material which 
is required to be removed. The levels taken subsequent to clearing and grubbing shall be the 
base level for computation of earthwork for embankment.

they shall be removed at the cost of the Contractor as ordered by the Engineer. Adequate 
precautions shall be taken to ensure that during construction, the slopes are not rendered 
unstable or give rise to recurrent slides after construction. If finished slopes slide into the 
roadway subsequently, such slides shall be removed and paid for at the Contract rate for 
the class of excavation involved, provided the slides are not due to any negligence on the 
part of the Contractor. The classification of the debris material from the slips, slides etc. shall 
conform to its condition at the time of removal and payment made accordingly regardless of 
its condition earlier.
301.3.10	
Dewatering
If water is met with in the excavations due to springs, seepage, rain or other causes, it 
shall be removed by suitable diversions, pumping or bailing out and the excavation kept 
dry whenever so required or directed by the Engineer. Care shall be taken to discharge the 
drained water into suitable outlets as not to cause damage to the works, crops or any other 
property. Due to any negligence on the part of the Contractor, if any such damage is caused, 
it shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to repair/restore to the original condition at 
his own cost or compensate for the damage.
301.3.11	
Use and Disposal of Excavated Materials

shall be backfilled to the original surface making due allowance for settlement, in layers not 
exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness to the required density, using suitable compaction 
equipment such as trench compactor, mechanical tamper, rammer or plate compactor as 
directed by the Engineer. 
301.4	
Plying of Construction Traffic
Construction traffic shall not use the cut formation and finished subgrade without the prior 
permission of the Engineer. Any damage arising out of such use shall be made good by the 
Contractor at his own cost.
301.5	
Preservation of Property
The Contractor shall undertake all reasonable precautions for the protection and preservation 
of any or all existing roadside trees, drains, sewers, sub-surface drains, pipes, conduits 
and any other structures under or above ground, which may be affected by construction 
operations and which, in the opinion of the Engineer, shall be continued in use without any 
change. Safety measures taken by the Contractor in this respect, shall be got approved from 
the Engineer. However, if any, of these objects is damaged by reason of the Contractor’s 
negligence, it shall be replaced or restored to the original condition at his cost. If the Contractor 
fails to do so, within the required time as directed by the Engineer or if, in the opinion of the 
Engineer, the actions initiated by the Contractor to replace/restore the damaged objects are 
not satisfactory, the Engineer shall arrange the replacement/restoration directly through any 
other agency at the risk and cost of the Contractor after issuing prior notice to the effect.
301.6	
Preparation of Cut Formation
The cut formation, which serves as a sub-grade, shall be prepared to receive the sub-base/
base course as directed by the Engineer.
Where the material in the subgrade has a density less than specified in Table 300-1, the same 
shall be loosened to a depth of 500 mm and compacted in layers in accordance with the 
requirements of Clause 305 adding fresh material, if any required, to maintain the formation 
level as shown on the drawings. Any unsuitable material encountered in the subgrade level 
shall be removed as directed by the Engineer, replaced with suitable material and compacted 
in accordance with Clause 305.
In rocky formations, the surface irregularities shall be corrected and the levels brought 
up to the specified elevation with granular base material as directed by the Engineer, laid 
and compacted in accordance with the respective Specifications for these materials. The 
unsuitable material shall be disposed of in accordance with Clause 301.3.11. After satisfying 



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 903
======================================================================
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
Section 300
51
the density requirements, the cut formation shall be prepared to receive the sub-base/base 
course in accordance with Clauses 310 and 311.
301.7	
Finishing Operations
Finishing operations shall include the work of properly shaping and dressing all excavated 
surfaces.
When completed, no point on the slopes shall vary from the designated slopes by more than 
150 mm measured at right angles to the slope, except where excavation is in rock (ordinary 
or hard) where no point shall vary more than 300 mm from the designated slope. In no case 
shall any portion of the slope encroach on the roadway.
The finished cut formation shall satisfy the surface tolerances described in Clause 902.
Where directed, the topsoil removed and conserved (Clauses 301.3.2 and 305.3.3) shall be 
spread over cut slopes, shoulders and other disturbed areas. Slopes may be roughened and 
moistened slightly, prior to the application of topsoil, in order to provide satisfactory bond. 
The depth of topsoil shall be sufficient to sustain plant growth, the usual thickness being from 
75 mm to 100 mm.
301.8	
Measurements for Payment
Excavation for roadway shall be measured by taking cross-sections at suitable intervals 
before the excavation starts (after clearing and grubbing/stripping etc. as the case may be) 
and after its completion and computing the volumes in cu.m by the method of average end 
areas for each class of material encountered. Where it is not feasible to compute volumes by 
this method because of erratic location of isolated deposits, the volumes shall be computed 
by other accepted methods.
At the option of the Engineer, the Contractor shall leave depth indicators during excavations 
of such shape and size and in such positions as directed so as to indicate the original ground 
level as accurately as possible. The Contractor shall see that these remain intact till the final 
measurements are taken.
For rock excavation, the overburden shall be removed first so that necessary cross-sections 
could be taken for measurement. Where cross-sectional measurements could not be taken 
due to irregular configuration or where the rock is admixed with other classes of materials, 
the volumes shall be computed on the basis of measurement of stacks of excavated 
rubble allowing a deduction of 35% therefrom. When volume is calculated on the basis of 
measurement of stacks of the excavated material other than rock, a deduction of 16% of 
stacked volume shall be allowed.

302.2	
Materials, Tools and Equipment
All the materials, tools and equipment used for blasting operations shall be of approved 
type. The Engineer may specify the type of explosives to be allowed in special cases. The 
fuse to be used in wet locations shall be sufficiently water-resistant as to be unaffected 
when immersed in water for 30 minutes. The rate of burning of the fuse shall be uniform and 
definitely known to permit such a length being cut as will permit sufficient time to the firer to 
reach safely before explosion takes place. Detonators shall be capable of giving effective 
blasting of the explosives. The blasting powder, explosives, detonators, fuses, etc., shall 
be fresh and not damaged due to dampness, moisture or any other cause. They shall be 
inspected before use and damaged articles shall be discarded totally and removed from the 
site immediately.
302.3	
Personnel
The blasting operation shall remain in the charge of competent and experienced supervisor 
and workmen who are thoroughly acquainted with the details of handling explosives and 
blasting operations.
302.4	
Blasting Operations
The blasting shall be carried out during the pre-determined hours of the day preferably during 
the mid-day luncheon hour or at the close of the work as ordered in writing by the Engineer. 
The hours shall be made known to the people in the vicinity.
The Contractor shall notify each public utility company having structures in proximity to the 
site of the work of his intention to use explosives. Such notice shall be given sufficiently in 
advance to enable the companies to take such steps as they may deem necessary to protect 
their property from injury. In advance of any blasting work within 50 m of any railway track or 
structures, the Contractor shall notify the concerned Railway Authority of the location, date, 
time and approximate duration of such blasting operation.
Red danger flags shall be displayed prominently in all directions during the blasting operations. 
The flags shall be planted 200 m from the blasting site in all directions. People, except those 
who actually light the fuse, shall be prohibited from entering this area and all persons including 
workmen shall be kept away from the flagged area, and all persons including workmen shall 
be removed from the flagged area at least 10 minutes before the firing. A warning siren shall 
be sounded for the above purpose. 
Only controlled blasting shall be resorted to along with the safeguard above at locations 
where built-up area, huts and structures in use lie within 200 m. Similarly excavation of hard 
rock without blasting is mandatory where people live within 20 m of blast site.

The charge holes shall be drilled to required depths and at suitable places. Blasting should 
be as light as possible consistent with thorough breakage of the material necessary for 
economic loading and hauling. Any method of blasting which leads to overshooting shall be 
discontinued.
When blasting is done with powder, the fuse cut to the required length shall be inserted into 
the hole and the powder dropped shall be gently tamped with copper roads with rounded 
ends. The explosive powder shall then be covered with tamping material which shall be 
tamped lightly but firmly.
When blasting is done with dynamite and other high explosives, dynamite cartridges shall 
be prepared by inserting the square cut end of a fuse into the detonator and finishing it with 
nippers at the open end, the detonator gently pushed into the primer leaving 1/3rd of the 
copper tube exposed outside. The paper of the cartridge shall then be closed up and securely 
bound with wire or twine. The primer shall be housed into the explosive. Boreholes shall be 
cleared of all debris and explosives inserted. The space of about 200 mm above the charge 
shall then be gently filled with dry clay, pressed home and the rest of the tamping formed of 
any convenient material gently packed with a wooden rammer.
At a time not more than 10 such charges will be prepared and fired. The man in charge shall 
blow a siren in a recognized manner for cautioning the people. All the people shall then be 
required to move to safe distances. The charges shall be lighted by the man-in-charge only. 
The man-in-charge shall count the number of explosions. He shall satisfy himself that all the 
charges have been exploded before allowing the workmen to go back to the work site.
After blasting operation, the Contractor shall compact the loose residual material below 
subgrade and replace the material removed below subgrade with suitable material.
302.5	
Misfire
In case of misfire, the following procedure shall be observed:
	
i)	
Sufficient time shall be allowed to account for the delayed blast. The 
man-in-charge shall inspect all the charges and determine the missed 
charge.
	
ii)	
If it is the blasting powder charge, it shall be completely flooded with 
water. A new hole shall be drilled at about 450 mm from the old hole 
and fired. This should blast the old charge. In case, it does not blast 
the old charge, the procedure shall be repeated till the old charge is 
blasted.
	
iii)	
In case of charges of gelignite, dynamite, etc., the man-in-charge shall 
gently remove the tamping and the primer with the detonator. A fresh 
detonator and primer shall then be used to blast the charge. Alternatively,

the hole may be cleared of 300 mm of tamping and the direction then 
ascertained by placing a stick in the hole. Another hole may then be 
drilled 150 mm away and parallel to it. This hole shall then be charged 
and fired when the misfired hole should explode at the same time. The 
man-in-charge shall at once report to the Contractor’s office and the 
Engineer all cases of misfire, the cause of the same and what steps 
were taken in connection therewith.
If a misfire has been found to be due to defective detonator or dynamite, the whole quantity 
in the box from which defective article was taken must be sent to the authority directed by the 
Engineer for inspection to ascertain whether all the remaining materials in the box are also 
defective.
302.6	
Account
A careful and day to day account of the explosive shall be maintained by the Contractor in 
an approved register and manner which shall be open to inspection by the Engineer at all 
times.
303	
PRESPLITTING  ROCK  EXCAVATION  SLOPES
303.1	
General
Presplitting is defined as the establishment of a specified excavation slope in rock by the 
controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories in properly aligned and spaced drill 
holes.
The presplitting technique shall be used for forming rock excavation slopes at locations 
shown on the drawings or as otherwise decided by the Engineer.
303.2	
Construction Operations
Prior to starting drilling operations for presplitting, the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer 
a plan outlining the position of all drill holes, depth of drilling, type of explosives to be used, 
loading pattern and sequence of firing. The drilling and blasting plan is for record purposes 
only and will not absolve the Contractor of his responsibility for using proper drilling and 
blasting procedures. Controlled blasting shall begin with a short test section of a length 
approved by the Engineer. The test section shall be presplit, production drilled and blasted 
and sufficient material excavated whereby the Engineer can determine if the Contractor’s 
method have produced an acceptable slope.
All overburden soil and weathered rock along the top of the excavation for a distance of 
about 5 to 15 m beyond the drilling limits, or to the end of the excavation, as decided by the 



======================================================================
PAGE 76 of 903
======================================================================
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
Section 300
57
Engineer shall be removed before drilling the presplitting holes. Particular care and attention 
shall be directed to the beginning and end of excavations to ensure complete removal of all 
overburden soil and weathered rock and to expose fresh rock to an elevation equal to the 
bottom of the adjacent lift of the presplitting holes being drilled.
Slope holes for presplitting shall be drilled along the line of the planned slope within the 
specified tolerances. The drill holes shall not be less than 60 mm nor more than 75 mm in 
diameter. Drilling operations shall be controlled by the use of proper equipment and technique 
to ensure that no hole shall deviate from the plane of the planned slope by more than 
300 mm nor shall any hole deviate from being parallel to an adjacent hole by more than 
two-third of the planned horizontal spacing between holes.
The length of presplit holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 9 m.
The spacing of presplit holes shall not exceed 900 mm on centres and shall be adjusted to 
result in a uniform shear face between holes.
Auxiliary drill holes along the presplit line, not loaded or stemmed, may be ordered by the 
Engineer. Except for spacing, auxiliary drill holes shall conform to the provisions for presplit 
holes.
The line of production holes shall be placed inside the presplit lines in such a manner as to 
avoid damage to the presplit face.
If necessary, to reduce shatter and overbreak of the presplit surface, the first line of the 
production holes shall be drilled parallel to the slope line at the top of the cut and at each 
bench level thereafter.
Any blasting technique, which results in damage to the presplit surface, shall be immediately 
discontinued.
No portion of any production holes shall be drilled within 2.5 m of a presplit plane except as 
approved by the Engineer. The bottom of the production holes shall not be lower than the 
bottom of the presplit holes.
A maximum offset of 600 mm will be permitted for a construction working bench at the bottom 
of each lift for use in drilling the next lower presplitting pattern. The drilling operations shall be 
adjusted to compensate for drift of previous levels and for the offset at the start of new levels 
to maintain the specified slope plane.
The maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater than one-half 
the diameter of the presplit hole.

Only standard cartridge explosives prepared and packaged by explosive manufacturing firms 
shall be used in presplit holes. These shall be fired as recommended by the manufacturer. 
Ammonium nitrate composition blasting agents will not be permitted in presplitting 
operations.
Stemming may be required to achieve a satisfactory presplit face. Stemming material shall 
be dry free-running material all of which passes 11.2 mm sieve and 90 percent of which is 
retained on 2.80 mm sieve. Stemmed presplit holes shall be completely filled to the collar.
All charges in each presplitting pattern shall be detonated simultaneously.
303.3	
Tolerances
The presplit face shall not deviate more than 300 mm from the plane passing through 
adjacent drill holes, except where the character of the rock is such that, as determined by the 
Engineer, irregularities are unavoidable. When completed, the average plane of the slopes 
shall conform to the slopes indicated on the plans and no point on the completed slopes shall 
vary from the designated slopes by more than 300 mm. These tolerances shall be measured 
perpendicular to the plane of the slope. In no case shall any portion of the slope encroach on 
the side drains.
As long as equally satisfactory presplit slopes are obtained, then either the slope face may 
be presplit before drilling for production blasting or presplitting the slope face and production 
blasting may be done at the same time, provided that the presplitting drill holes are fired with 
zero delay and the production holes are delayed starting at the row of holes farthest from the 
slope and progressing in steps to the row of holes nearest the presplit lines, which row shall 
be delayed at least 50 milliseconds. In either case the presplitting holes shall extend either 
to the end of the excavation or for a distance of not less than 15 m beyond the limits of the 
production holes to be detonated.
303.4	
Measurements for Payment
The area of presplitting to be paid for, will be measured as square metres of acceptable 
presplit slope surface.
303.5	
Rates
The Contract unit rate for presplitting work shall be payment in full for carrying out the required 
operations for obtaining acceptable presplit slope surfaces. The quantity of rock excavated 
through the production/presplit holes shall be paid for as per Clause 301.9.1.

unless the type of material encountered is such as to require changes, in which case the depth 
shall be as ordered by the Engineer. Propping shall be undertaken when any foundation or 
stressed zone from an adjoining structure is within a line of 1 vertical to 2 horizontal from the 
bottom of the excavation.
Where blasting is to be resorted-to, the same shall be carried out in accordance with 
Clause 302 and all precautions indicated therein observed. Where blasting is likely to

endanger adjoining foundations or other structures, necessary precautions such as controlled 
blasting, providing rubber mat cover to prevent flying of debris etc. shall be taken to prevent 
any damage.
304.3.3	
Dewatering and Protection
Normally, open foundations shall be laid dry. Where water is met with in excavation due to 
stream flow, seepage, springs, rain or other reasons, the Contractor shall take adequate 
measures such as bailing, pumping, constructing diversion channels, drainage channels, 
bunds, depression of water level by well-point system, cofferdams and other necessary works 
to keep the foundation trenches dry when so required and to protect the green concrete/
masonry against damage by erosion or sudden rising of water level. The methods to be 
adopted in this regard and other details thereof shall be left to the choice of the Contractor 
but subject to the approval of the Engineer. Approval of the Engineer shall, however, not 
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the adequacy of dewatering and protection 
arrangements for the quality and safety of the works.
Where cofferdams are required, these shall be carried to adequate depths and heights, be 
safely designed and constructed and be made as watertight as is necessary for facilitating 
construction to be carried out inside them. The interior dimensions of the cofferdams shall 
be such as to give sufficient clearance for the construction and inspection and to permit 
installation of pumping equipments, etc., inside the enclosed area.
If it is determined beforehand that the foundations cannot be laid dry or the situation is found 
that the percolation is too heavy for keeping the foundation dry, the foundation concrete shall 
be laid under water by tremie pipe only. In case of flowing water or artesian springs, the flow 
shall be stopped or reduced as far as possible at the time of placing the concrete.
Pumping from the interior of any foundation enclosure shall be done in such a manner as to 
preclude the possibility of the movement of water through any fresh concrete. No pumping 
shall be permitted during the placing of concrete and for a period of at least 24 hours thereafter, 
unless it is done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete work by a watertight wall 
or other similar means.
At the discretion of the Contractor, cement grouting or other approved methods may be used 
to prevent or reduce seepage and to protect the excavation area.
The Contractor shall take all precautions in diverting channels and in discharging the drained 
water as not to cause damage to the works, crops or any other property.
304.3.4	
Preparation of Foundation
The bottom of the foundation shall be levelled both longitudinally and transversely or stepped 
as directed by the Engineer. Before footing is laid, the surface shall be slightly watered and

rammed. In the event of excavation having been made deeper than that shown on the drawings 
or as otherwise ordered by the Engineer, the extra depth shall be made up with concrete as 
per Clause 2104.1 at the cost of the Contractor. Ordinary filling shall not be permitted to bring 
the foundation to the design level as shown in the drawing.
When rock or other hard strata is encountered, it shall be freed of all soft and loose material, 
cleaned and cut to a firm surface either level or stepped as directed by the Engineer. All 
seams shall be cleaned out and filled with cement mortar or grout to the satisfaction of the 
Engineer. In the case of excavation in rock, annular space around footing shall be filled with 
lean concrete M 15 upto the top level of rock.
If the depth of fill required is more than 1.5 m in soft rock or 0.6 m in hard rock above the 
foundation level, the filling upto this level shall be done with M-15 concrete and portion above 
shall be filled by concrete or by boulders grouted with cement. 
When foundation piles are used, the excavation for pile cap shall be done after driving/casting 
of all piles forming the group. After pile driving operations in a given pit are completed, all 
loose and displaced materials therein shall be removed to the level of the bottom of the pile 
cap.
304.3.5	
Slips and Slip-Outs
If there are any slips or slip-outs in the excavation, these shall be removed by the Contractor 
at his own cost.
304.3.6	
Public Safety
Near towns, villages and all frequented places, trenches and foundation pits shall be 
securely fenced, provided with proper caution signs and marked with red lights at night to 
avoid accidents. The Contractor shall take adequate protective measures to see that the 
excavation operations do not affect or damage adjoining structures. For safety precautions, 
guidance may be taken from IS:3764.
304.3.7	
Backfilling
Backfilling shall be done with approved material after concrete or masonry is fully set and 
carried out in such a way as not to cause undue thrust on any part of the structure. All space 
between foundation masonry or concrete and the sides of excavation shall be refilled to the 
original surface in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness. The compaction shall 
be done with the help of suitable equipment such as trench compactor, mechanical tamper, 
rammer, plate vibrator etc., after necessary watering, so as to achieve the maximum dry 
density.

Construction Operations
305.3.1	
Setting Out
After the site has been cleared to Clause 201, the work shall be set out to Clause 301.3.1 The 
limits of embankment/sub-grade shall be marked by fixing batter pegs on both sides at regular 
intervals as guides before commencing the earthwork. The embankment/sub-grade shall be 
built sufficiently wider than the design dimension so that surplus material may be trimmed, 
ensuring that the remaining material is to the desired density and in position specified and 
conforms to the specified side slopes.
305.3.2	
Dewatering
If the foundation of the embankment is in an area with stagnant water, and in the opinion of 
the Engineer it is feasible to remove it, the same shall be removed by bailing out or pumping, 
as directed by the Engineer and the area of the embankment foundation shall be kept dry. 
Care shall be taken to discharge the drained water so as not to cause damage to the works, 
crops or any other property. Due to any negligence on the part of the Contractor, if any such 
damage is caused, it shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor to repair/restore it to 
original condition or compensate for the damage at his own cost.
If the embankment is to be constructed under water, Clause 305.4.6 shall apply.
305.3.3	
Stripping and Storing Topsoil
When so directed by the Engineer, the topsoil from all areas of cutting and from all areas to 
be covered by embankment foundation shall be stripped to specified depths not exceeding 
150 mm and stored in stockpiles of height not exceeding 2 m for covering embankment 
slopes, cut slopes and other disturbed areas where re-vegetation is desired. Topsoil shall 
not be unnecessarily subjected to traffic either before stripping or when in a stockpile. 
Stockpiles shall not be surcharged or otherwise loaded and multiple handling shall be kept 
to a minimum.
305.3.4	
Compacting Ground Supporting Embankment/Sub-Grade
Where necessary, the original ground shall be levelled to facilitate placement of first layer 
of embankment, scarified, mixed with water and then compacted by rolling in accordance 
with Clauses 305.3.5 and 305.3.6 so as to achieve minimum dry density as given in 
Table 300-2.

In case where the difference between the sub-grade level (top of the sub-grade on which 
pavement rests) and ground level is less than 0.5 m and the ground does not have 97 percent 
relative compaction with respect to the dry density (as given in Table 300-2), the ground 
shall be loosened upto a level 0.5 m below the sub-grade level, watered and compacted in 
layers in accordance with Clauses 305.3.5 and 305.3.6 to achieve dry density not less than 
97 percent relative compaction as given in Table 300-2. 
Where so directed by the Engineer, any unsuitable material occurring in the embankment 
foundation (500 mm portion just below the sub-grade) shall be removed, suitably disposed 
and replaced by approved materials laid in layers to the required degree of compaction.
Any foundation treatment specified for embankments especially high embankments, resting 
on suspect foundations as revealed by borehole logs shall be carried out in a manner and 
to the depth as desired by the Engineer. Where the ground on which an embankment is 
to be built has any of such material types (a) to (f) in Clause 305.2.1.1 at least 500 mm of 
such material must be removed and replaced by acceptable fill material before embankment 
construction commences.
305.3.5	
Spreading Material in Layers and Bringing to Appropriate Moisture 
Content
305.3.5.1	
The embankment and sub-grade material shall be spread in layers of uniform 
thickness in the entire width with a motor grader. The compacted thickness of each layer 
shall not be more than 250 mm when vibratory roller/vibratory soil compactor is used and 
not more than 200 mm when 80-100 kN static roller is used. The motor grader blade shall 
have hydraulic control suitable for initial adjustment and maintain the same so as to achieve 
the specific slope and grade. Successive layers shall not be placed until the layer under 
construction has been thoroughly compacted to the specified requirements as in Table 300-2 
and got approved by the Engineer. Each compacted layer shall be finished parallel to the final 
cross-section of the embankment.
305.3.5.2	
Moisture content of the material shall be checked at the site of placement 
prior to commencement of compaction; if found to be out of agreed limits, the same shall 
be made good. Where water is required to be added in such constructions, water shall be 
sprinkled from a water tanker fitted with sprinkler capable of applying water uniformly with a 
controllable rate of flow to variable widths of surface but without any flooding. The water shall 
be added uniformly and thoroughly mixed in soil by blading, using disc harrow until a uniform 
moisture content is obtained throughout the depth of the layer.
If the material delivered to the roadbed is too wet, it shall be dried, by aeration and exposure 
to the sun, till the moisture content is acceptable for compaction. Should circumstances 
arise, where owing to wet weather, the moisture content cannot be reduced to the required 
amount by the above procedure, compaction work shall be suspended.



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 903
======================================================================
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
Section 300
69
Moisture content of each layer of soil shall be checked in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 2), 
and unless otherwise mentioned, shall be so adjusted, making due allowance for evaporation 
losses, that at the time of compaction it is in the range of 1 percent above to 2 percent below 
the optimum moisture content determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8) as the case 
may be. Expansive clays shall, however, be compacted at moisture content corresponding to 
the specified dry density, but on the wet side of the optimum moisture content obtained from 
the laboratory compaction curve.
After adding the required amount of water, the soil shall be processed by means of graders, 
harrows, rotary mixers or as otherwise approved by the Engineer until the layer is uniformly 
wet.
Clods or hard lumps of earth shall be broken to have a maximum size of 75 mm when being 
placed in the embankment and a maximum size of 50 mm when being placed in the sub-
grade.
305.3.5.3	
Embankment and other areas of fill shall, unless otherwise required in the 
Contract or permitted by the Engineer, be constructed evenly over their full width and their 
fullest possible extent and the Contractor shall control and direct construction plant and other 
construction vehicles. Damage by construction plant and other vehicular traffic shall be made 
good by the Contractor with material having the same characteristics and strength of the 
material before it was damaged.
Embankments and unsupported fills shall not be constructed with steeper side slopes or to 
greater widths than those shown in the drawings, except to permit adequate compaction at 
the edges before trimming back, or to obtain the final profile following any settlement of the 
fill and the underlying material,
Whenever fill is to be deposited against the face of a natural slope, or sloping earthworks 
face including embankments, cuttings, other fills and excavations steeper than 1 vertical to 
4 horizontal, such faces shall be benched as per Clause 305.4.1 immediately before placing 
the subsequent fill.
All permanent faces of side slopes of embankments and other areas of fill shall, subsequent 
to any trimming operations, be reworked and sealed to the satisfaction of the Engineer by 
tracking a tracked vehicle, considered suitable by the Engineer, on the slope or any other 
method approved by the Engineer.
305.3.6	
Compaction
Only the compaction equipment approved by the Engineer shall be employed to compact 
the different material types encountered during construction. Static three-wheeled roller, self 
propelled single drum vibratory roller, tandem vibratory roller, pneumatic tyre roller, pad foot 



======================================================================
PAGE 89 of 903
======================================================================
Section 300
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
70
roller, etc., of suitable size and capacity as approved by the Engineer shall be used for the 
different types and grades of materials required to be compacted either individually or in 
suitable combinations.
The compaction shall be done with the help of self-propelled single drum vibratory roller or pad 
foot vibratory roller of 80 to 100 kN static weight or heavy pneumatic tyre roller of adequate 
capacity capable of achieving the required compaction. The Contractor shall demonstrate the 
efficacy of the equipment he intends to use by carrying out compaction trials. The procedure 
to be adopted for the site trials shall be submitted to the Engineer for approval.
Earthmoving plant shall not be accepted as compaction equipment nor shall the use of a 
lighter category of plant to provide any preliminary compaction to assist the use of heavier 
plant be taken into account.
Each layer of the material shall be thoroughly compacted to the densities specified in 
Table 300-2. Subsequent layers shall be placed only after the finished layer has been tested 
according to Clause 903.2.2 and accepted by the Engineer. The Engineer may permit 
measurement of field dry density by a nuclear moisture/density gauge used in accordance 
with agreed procedure and provided the gauge is calibrated to give results identical to that 
obtained from tests in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 28). A record of the same shall be 
maintained by the Contractor.
When density measurements reveal any soft areas in the embankment/sub-grade/earthen 
shoulders, further compaction shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer. If inspite of 
that the specified compaction is not achieved, the material in the soft areas shall be removed 
and replaced by approved material, compacted using appropriate mechanical means such as 
light weight vibratory roller, double drum walk behind roller, vibratory plate compactor, trench 
compactor or vibratory tamper to the density requirements and satisfaction of the Engineer.
305.3.7	
Drainage
The surface of the embankment/sub-grade at all times during construction shall be maintained 
at such a crossfall (not flatter than that required for effective drainage of an earthen surface) 
as will shed water and prevent ponding.
305.3.8	
Repairing of Damages Caused by Rain/Spillage of Water
The soil in the affected portion shall be removed in such areas as directed by the Engineer 
before next layer is laid and refilled in layers and compacted using appropriate mechanical 
means such as small vibratory roller, plate compactor or power rammer to achieve the 
required density in accordance with Clause 305.3.6. If the cut is not sufficiently wide for use 
of required mechanical means for compaction, the same shall be widened suitably to permit 
their use for proper compaction. Tests shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer to 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
Section 300
71
ascertain the density requirements of the repaired area. The work of repairing the damages 
including widening of the cut, if any, shall be carried out by the Contractor at his own cost, 
including the arranging of machinery/equipment for the purpose.
305.3.9	
Finishing Operations
Finishing operations shall include the work of shaping and dressing the shoulders/verge/
roadbed and side slopes to conform to the alignment, levels, cross-sections and dimensions 
shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer subject to the surface tolerance 
described in Clause 902. Both the upper and lower ends of the side slopes shall be rounded 
off to improve appearance and to merge the embankment with the adjacent terrain.
The topsoil, removed and conserved earlier (Clauses 301.3.2 and 305.3.3) shall be spread 
over the fill slopes as per directions of the Engineer to facilitate the growth of vegetation. 
Slopes shall be roughened and moistened slightly prior to the application of the topsoil in 
order to provide satisfactory bond. The depth of the topsoil shall be sufficient to sustain plant 
growth, the usual thickness being from 75 mm to 150 mm.
Where directed, the slopes shall be turfed with sods in accordance with Clause 307. If seeding 
and mulching of slopes is prescribed, this shall be done to the requirements of Clause 308.
When earthwork operations have been substantially completed, the road area shall be 
cleared of all debris, and ugly scars in the construction area responsible for objectionable 
appearance eliminated.
305.4	
Construction of Embankment and Sub-grade under Special Conditions
305.4.1	
Earthwork for Widening Existing Road Embankment
When an existing embankment and/or sub-grade is to be widened and its slopes are steeper 
than 1 vertical on 4 horizontal, continuous horizontal benches, each at least 300 mm wide, 
shall be cut into the old slope for ensuring adequate bond with the fresh embankment/sub-
grade material to be added. The material obtained from cutting of benches could be utilized 
in the widening of the embankment/subgrade. However, when the existing slope against 
which the fresh material is to be placed is flatter than 1 vertical on 4 horizontal, the slope 
surface may only be ploughed or scarified instead of resorting to benching.
Where the width of the widened portions is insufficient to permit the use of conventional 
rollers, compaction shall be carried out with the help of light weight vibratory roller, double 
drum walk behind roller, vibratory plate compactor or vibratory tamper or any other appropriate 
equipment approved by the Engineer. End dumping of material from trucks for widening 
operations shall be avoided except in difficult circumstances when the extra width is too 
narrow to permit the movement of any other types of hauling equipment.

305.4.2	
Earthwork for Embankment and Sub-Grade to be Placed Against 
Sloping Ground
Where an embankment/subgrade is to be placed against sloping ground, the latter shall be 
appropriately benched or ploughed/scarified as required in Clause 305.4.1 before placing the 
embankment/sub-grade material. Extra earthwork involved in benching or due to ploughing/
scarifying etc. shall be considered incidental to the work.
For wet conditions, benches with slightly inward fall and subsoil drains at the lowest point 
shall be provided as per the drawings, before the fill is placed against sloping ground.
Where the Contract requires construction of transverse subsurface drain at the cut-fill 
interface, work on the same shall be carried out to Clause 309 in proper sequence with the 
embankment and sub-grade work as approved by the Engineer.
305.4.3	
Earthwork over Existing Road Surface
Where the embankment is to be placed over an existing road surface, the work shall be 
carried out as indicated below:
	
i)	
If the existing road surface is of granular type and lies within 1 m of 
the new formation levels, it shall be scarified to a depth of 50 mm or as 
directed so as to provide ample bond between the old and new material 
ensuring that at least 500 mm portion below the top of new sub-grade 
level is compacted to the desired density;
	
ii)	
If the existing road surface is of bituminous type or cement concrete 
and lies within 1 m of the new formation level, the bituminous or cement 
concrete layer shall be removed completely; 
	
iii)	
If the level difference between the existing road surface and the new 
formation level is more than 1 m, the existing surface shall be roughened 
after ensuring that the minimum thickness of 500 mm of subgrade is 
available.
305.4.4	
Embankment and Sub-Grade Around Structures
To avoid interference with the construction of abutments, wing walls or return walls of 
culvert/bridge structures, the Contractor shall, at points, to be determined by the Engineer 
suspend work on embankment forming approaches to such structures, until such time as 
the construction of the latter is sufficiently advanced to permit the completion of approaches 
without the risk of damage to the structure.
Unless directed otherwise, the filling around culverts, bridges and other structures upto a 
distance of twice the height of the road from the back of the abutment shall be carried out

independent of the work on the main embankment. The fill material shall not be placed against 
any abutment or wing wall, unless permission has been given by the Engineer but in any case 
not until the concrete or masonry has been in position for 14 days. The embankment and 
sub-grade shall be brought up simultaneously in equal layers on each side of the structure to 
avoid displacement and unequal pressure. The sequence of work in this regard shall be got 
approved from the Engineer.
The material used for backfill shall not be an organic soil or highly plastic clay having plasticity 
index and liquid limit more than 20 and 40 respectively when tested according to IS:2720 
(Part 5). Filling behind abutments and wing walls for all structures shall conform to the general 
guidelines given in IRC:78. The fill material shall be deposited in horizontal layers in loose 
thickness and compacted thoroughly to the requirements of Table 300-2.
Where the provision of any filter medium is specified behind the abutment, the same shall be 
laid in layers simultaneously with the laying of fill material. The material used for filter shall 
conform to the requirements for filter medium spelt out in Clause 2504 unless otherwise 
specified in the Contract.
Where it may be impracticable to use conventional rollers, the compaction shall be carried out 
by appropriate mechanical means such as small vibratory roller, plate compactor or power 
rammer. Care shall be taken to see that the compaction equipment does not hit or come too 
close to any structural member so as to cause any damage to them or excessive pressure 
against the structure.
305.4.5	
Construction of Embankment over Ground Incapable of Supporting 
Construction Equipment
Where embankment is to be constructed across ground which will not support the weight of 
repeated heavy loads of construction equipment, the first layer of the fill may be constructed 
by placing successive loads of material in a uniformly distributed layer of a minimum thickness 
required to support the construction equipment as permitted by the Engineer. The Contractor, 
if so desired by him, may also use suitable geosynthetic material to increase the bearing 
capacity of the foundation. This exception to normal procedure will not be permitted where, in 
the opinion of the Engineer, the embankments could be constructed in the approved manner 
over such ground by the use of lighter or modified equipment after proper ditching and 
drainage have been provided. Where this exception is permitted, the selection of the material 
and the construction procedure to obtain an acceptable layer shall be the responsibility of the 
Contractor. The cost of providing suitable traffic conditions for construction equipment over 
any area of the Contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor and no extra payment 
will be made to him. The remainder of the embankment shall be constructed as specified in 
Clause 305.3.

conformity with Clause 305.2.1.1 or the material from the approved borrow area.
Where provided, stage construction of embankment and controlled rates of filling shall be 
carried out in accordance with the Contract including installation of instruments and its 
monitoring.
Where required, the Contractor shall surcharge embankments or other areas of fill with 
approved material for the periods specified in the Contract. If settlement of surcharged fill 
results the Contractor shall bring the resultant level up to formation level with acceptable 
material for use in fill.
305.4.8	
Settlement Period
Where settlement period is specified in the Contract, the embankment shall remain in place 
for the required settlement period before excavating for abutment, wing wall, retaining wall, 
footings, etc., or driving foundation piles. The duration of the required settlement period at 
each location shall be as provided for in the Contract or as directed by the Engineer.
305.5	
Plying of Traffic
Construction and other vehicular traffic shall not use the prepared surface of the embankment

SOIL  EROSION  AND  SEDIMENTATION  CONTROL
306.1	
Description
This work shall consist of measures as shown on drawings or as directed by the Engineer to 



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 903
======================================================================
Section 300

control soil erosion, sedimentation and water pollution, through use of berms, dikes, sediment 
basins, fibre mats, mulches, grasses, slope drains, and other devices.
306.2	
Materials
All materials shall meet commercial grade standards and shall be approved by the Engineer 
before being used in the work
306.3	
Construction Operations
Prior to the start of the relevant construction, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer 
for approval his schedules for carrying out temporary and permanent erosion/sedimentation 
control works as are applicable for the items of clearing and grubbing, roadway and drainage 
excavation, embankment/sub-grade construction, bridges and other structures across water 
courses, pavement courses and shoulders. He shall also submit for approval his proposed 
method of erosion/sedimentation control on service road and borrow pits and his plan for 
disposal of waste materials. Work shall not be started until the erosion/sedimentation control 
schedules and methods of operations for the applicable construction have been approved by 
the Engineer.
The surface area of erodible earth material exposed by clearing and grubbing, excavation, 
borrow and fill operations shall be limited to the extent practicable. The Contractor shall provide 
immediate permanent or temporary erosion, slope protection and sedimentation control 
measures to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation that will adversely affect construction 
operations, damage adjacent properties, or cause contamination of nearby streams or other 
water courses, lakes, reservoirs etc. Such work may involve the construction of temporary 
berms, dikes, sediment basins, slope drains and use of temporary mulches, fabrics, mats 
seeding, or other control devices or methods as necessary to control erosion and sedimentation. 
Cut and fill slopes shall be seeded and turfed as shown on the drawings.
The Contractor shall be required to incorporate all permanent erosion and sedimentation 
control features into the project at the earliest practicable time as outlined in his accepted 
schedule to minimize the need for temporary erosion and sedimentation control measures.
Temporary erosion/sedimentation and pollution control measures shall be used to control 
the phenomenon of erosion, sedimentation and pollution that may develop during normal 
construction practices, but may neither be foreseen during design stage nor associated with 
permanent control features on the Project.
Where erosion or sedimentation is likely to be a problem, clearing and grubbing operations 
should be so scheduled and performed that grading operations and permanent erosion or 
sedimentation control features can follow immediately thereafter if the project conditions 
permit; otherwise temporary erosion or sedimentation control measures may be required 



======================================================================

Section 300
79
between successive construction stages. Under no conditions shall a large surface area 
of erodible earth material be exposed at one time by clearing and grubbing or excavation 
without prior approval of the Engineer.
The Engineer may limit the area of excavation, borrow and embankment operations in 
progress, commensurate with the Contractor’s capability and progress in keeping the finish 
grading, mulching, seeding and other such permanent erosion, sedimentation and pollution 
control measures, in accordance with the accepted schedule. Should seasonal limitations 
make such coordination unrealistic, temporary erosion/sedimentation control measures shall 
be taken immediately to the extent feasible and justified.
In the event temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures become 
necessary due to the Contractor’s negligence, carelessness or failure to install permanent 
controls as a part of the work as scheduled or ordered by the Engineer, these shall be carried 
out at the Contractor’s own cost. Temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control 
work required, which is not attributed to the Contractor’s negligence, carelessness or failure 
to install permanent controls, will be performed as ordered by the Engineer.
Temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control may include construction work 
outside the right-of-way where such work is necessary as a result of road construction such 
as borrow pit operations, service roads and equipment storage sites.
The temporary erosion, sedimentation and pollution control features installed by the Contractor 
shall be acceptably maintained by him till these are needed, unless otherwise agreed by the 
Engineer.
306.4	
Measurement for Payment
The soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control works shall be measured in terms of 
units specified in the Bill of Quantities for the respective items.
306.5	
Rates
The Contract unit rate for different items of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution 
control works shall be payment in full for carrying out all required operations including full 
compensation for all labour, materials, tools, equipment and incidentals to complete the 
works to the Specifications.
307	
TURFING  WITH  SODS
307.1	
Scope
This work shall consist of furnishing and laying of the live sod of perennial turf forming grass on 



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 903
======================================================================
Section 300
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
80
embankment slopes, verges (earthen shoulders) or other locations shown on the drawings or 
as directed by the Engineer. Unless otherwise specified, the work shall be taken up as soon 
as possible following construction of the embankment, provided the season is favourable for 
establishment of the sod.
307.2	
Materials
The sod shall consist of dense, well-rooted growth of permanent and desirable grasses, 
indigenous to the locality where it is to be used, and shall be practically free from weeds or 
other undesirable matter. At the time the sod is cut, the grass on the sod shall have a length 
of approximately 50 mm and the sod shall have been freed of debris.
Thickness of the sod shall be as uniform as possible, with some 50-80 mm or so of soil 
covering the grass roots depending on the nature of the sod, so that practically all the dense 
root system of the grasses is retained in the sod strip. The sods shall be cut in rectangular 
strips of uniform width, not less than about 250 mm x 300 mm in size but not so large that it 
is inconvenient to handle and transport these without damage. During wet weather, the sod 
shall be allowed to dry sufficiently to prevent tearing during handling and during dry weather 
shall be watered before lifting to ensure its vitality and prevent the dropping of the soil in 
handling.
307.3	
Construction Operations
307.3.1	
Preparation of the Earth Bed
The area to be sodded shall have been previously constructed to the required slope and 
cross-section. Soil on the area shall be loosened, freed of all stones larger than 50 mm size, 
sticks, stumps and any undesirable foreign matter, and brought to a reasonably fine granular 
texture to a depth of not less than 25 mm for receiving the sod.
Where required, topsoil shall be spread over the slopes. Prior to placing the topsoil, the 
slopes shall be scarified to a depth which, after settlement, will provide the required nominal 
depth shown on the drawings. Spreading shall not be done when the ground is excessively 
wet.
Following soil preparation and top soiling, where required, fertilizer and ground limestone when 
specified shall be spread uniformly at the rate indicated on the drawings. After spreading, the 
materials shall be incorporated in the soil by using disc harrow or other means to the depths 
shown on the drawings.
307.3.2	
Placing the Sods
The prepared sod bed shall be moistened to the loosened depth, if not already sufficiently 
moist, and the sod shall be placed thereon within approximately 24 hours after the same

had been cut. Each sod strip shall be laid edge to edge and such that the joints caused by 
abutting ends are staggered. Every strip, after it is snugly placed against the strips already in 
position, shall be lightly tamped with suitable wooden or metal tampers so as to eliminate air 
pockets and to press it into the underlying soil.
On side slopes steeper than 2 (horizontal) to 1 (vertical), the laying of sods shall be started 
from bottom upwards. At points where water may flow over a sodded area, the upper edges 
of the sod strips shall be turned into the soil below the adjacent area and a layer of earth 
placed over this followed by its thorough compaction.
307.3.3	
Staking the Sods
Where the side slope is 2 (horizontal) to 1 (vertical) or steeper and the distance along the 
slope is more than 2 m, the sods shall be staked with pegs or nails spaced approximately 500 
to 1000 mm along the longitudinal axis of the sods strips. Stakes shall be driven approximately 
plumb through the sods to be almost flush with them.
307.3.4	
Top Dressing
After the sods have been laid in position, the surface shall be cleaned of loose sod, excess 
soil and other foreign material. Thereafter, a thin layer of topsoil shall be scattered over the 
surface of top dressing and the area thoroughly moistened by sprinkling with water.
307.3.5	
Watering and Maintenance
The sods shall be watered by the Contractor for a period of at least four weeks after laying. 
Watering shall be so done as to avoid erosion and prevent damage to sodded areas by 
wheels of water tanks.
The Contractor shall erect necessary warning signs and barriers, repair or replace sodded 
areas failing to show uniform growth of grass or damaged by his operations and shall otherwise 
maintain the sod at his cost until final acceptance.
307.4	
Measurements for Payment
Turfing with sods shall be measured as finished work in square metres.
307.5	
Rate
The Contract unit rate for turfing with sods shall mean paying in full for carrying out all the 
required operations explained above including compensation for

Seeds
The seeds shall be of approved quality and type suitable for the soil on which these are to be 
applied, and shall give acceptable purity and germination to requirements set down by the 
Engineer.
Fertilizers shall consist of standard commercial materials and conform to the grade specified. 
Organic manure shall be fully putrified organic matter such as cow dung.
Mulching materials shall consist of straw, hay, wood shavings, or sawdust and shall be 
delivered in dry condition suitable for placing with a mulch blower. They shall be reasonably 
free of weed seed and such foreign materials as may detract from their effectiveness as a 
mulch or be injurious to the plant growth.
308.2.2	
Topsoil
Topsoil shall not be obtained from an area known to have noxious weeds growing in it. If 
treated with herbicide or sterilents, it shall be got tested by appropriate agricultural authority 
to determine the residual in the soil. Topsoil shall not contain less than 2 percent and more 
than 12 percent organic matter.
308.2.3

Seeding Operations
308.3.1	
Seed-Bed Preparation
The area to be seeded shall be brought to the required slope and cross-section by filling, 
reshaping eroded areas and refinishing slopes, medians etc. Topsoil shall be evenly spread 
over the specified areas to the depth shown on the drawings, unless otherwise approved by 
the Engineer. The seed-bed preparation shall consist of eliminating all live plants by suitable 
means using agricultural implements. All stones 150 mm and larger shall be removed. The 
soil shall be excavated on the contour to a depth of 100 mm. All clods larger than 25 mm 
in diameter shall be crushed and packed. Where necessary, water shall then be applied. 
All topsoil shall be compacted unless otherwise specified or approved by the Engineer. 
Compaction shall be by slope compactor, cleated tractor or similar equipment approved by

Engineer. The addition and removal of surcharge shall be incidental 
to the work except for payment of additional surcharge quantity 
forming part of permanent embankment. The quantity for payment will 
be determined based on the settlements readings observed through 
instrumentation. 
	
vi)	
Instrumentation and Monitoring the Behaviour of Sub-Soil/ 
Embankment : Monitoring the behavior of the sub-soil/ embankment 
construction shall form part of the work. The design shall be based 
on the gain in the shear strength of the subsoil due to consolidation 
process. The following critical parameters shall be monitored : 
	
a)	
Monitoring the Build up and Dissipation of Pore Pressure: 
Casagrande open standpipe type piezometers shall be used for 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Section 300
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
96
the measurement of changes in pore pressure. The specifications 
for the Casagrande piezometer shall be as follows. 
	
	
The piezometer shall be 38 mm in dia and 300 mm in length;
	
	
The air entry value shall be of the order of 0.3 kg/cm2.
	
	
The standpipe shall be more than 16 mm in diameter;
	
	
The piezometer shall be installed in 150 mm borehole, at specified 
depths. Sand cover around the piezometer tip and bentonite seal 
above shall be provided; and

Piezometers including dummy piezometers shall be installed at 
locations specified by the Engineer.
	
b)	
Rate and Magnitude of Vertical Settlements of the Subsoil 
under the Surcharge Load : Settlements shall be measured by 
installing platform type settlement gauges, which consist of the 
following :
	
	
Wooden base plate 1000 mm square and 50 mm thick;
	
	
GI pipe of 25 mm dia fitted to the base plate with a suitable sleeve 
arrangement and nuts and bolts;
	
	
Outer loose fitting sleeve, to prevent soil form coming into contact 
with the inner pipe;
	
	
The pipe and the sleeve consist of 1.5 m long sections, which can 
be screwed on at the top, so that as the surcharge is built up, the 
top of the pipe is well clear of the fill;
	
	
Settlement gauges shall be installed at the ground level, before the 
starting of the fill construction. These shall be installed locations specified 
by the Engineer. The readings of settlement gauges also form the basis 
to estimate the quantity of surcharge forming part of permanent work. 
The number of settlement gauges shall be decided by the Engineer 
keeping in view this aspect.
	
c)	
Measurement of Shear Strength : The shear strength parameters 
of the subsoil [unconfined compressive strength (UCS)] shall be 
measured at locations specified by the Engineer at the end of each 
stage of surcharge loading in order to compare the actual details 
with the design assumptions. For the recovery of undisturbed 
samples from the subsoil for determining UCS, before start 
of construction of surcharge, 100 mm dia casing pipe shall be 
installed into the ground to 3 m depth, preferably by driving; the 
top of the casing pipe shall have provision for adding extensions

======================================================================
Earthwork, Erosion Control and Drainage
Section 300
97
at top by screw coupling; and as the surcharge construction 
proceeds the casing pipe shall be extended. This procedure 
ensures avoiding drilling through the surcharge already placed 
as well as any damage to the installed band drains. Undisturbed 
samples (UDS) are recovered and UCS is determined in the site 
laboratory (sending UDS sample to distant laboratories would 
result in loss of water content and disturbance of the samples 
leading to erroneous values of UCS). Undisturbed samples shall 
be recovered at every 1.5 m depth at the specified locations, so 
that complete strength profile of subsoil is obtained.
	
vii)	
During the placing of the surcharge and compaction, the Contractor shall 
take utmost care so that the monitoring instruments are not damaged. 
Compaction by small vibratory rollers shall be done for 1.5 m around 
the monitoring instruments and bigger rollers shall not be used near the 
monitoring instruments. Similarly care shall be taken that movement of 
dumpers does not damage the monitoring instruments.
	
viii)	 Frequency of Observations : The readings of the piezometers and 
the settlement gauges shall be recorded at the following frequency. 
	
a)	
Daily reading shall be taken in stretches where filling/ surcharge 
operations are in progress. Weekly readings shall be taken in 
stretches, where no filling/ surcharge is being done.
	
b)	
Weekly readings shall be taken after the desired fill/ surcharge 
height is achieved, till the next stage filling commences. All data 
shall be recorded in a register and maintained properly.
	
c)	
The Data from the monitoring instruments provides the background 
for regulating the rate of placing the fill/ surcharge as well as the 
waiting period between stages. 
	
ix)	
Precautions against Pilferage: The observation data shall be recorded 
during construction and for three months thereafter. It is therefore 
essential that the instruments are not tampered and stolen. Suitable 
precautions shall be taken in this regard by the Contractor.
	
x)	
Drainage of Ground Water : The water which will come out from the 
subsoil through vertical drains will be accumulated at temporary ditches 
to be dug at nearby areas and the accumulated water will be dewatered 
regularly from the ditches to the outfalls as directed by the Engineer. 
	
xi)

Construction Operations
401.3.1	
Preparation of Sub-grade
Immediately prior to the laying of sub-base, the subgrade already finished to Clause 301 or 
305 as applicable shall be prepared by removing all vegetation and other extraneous matter, 
lightly sprinkled with water, if necessary and rolled with two passes of 80–100 kN smooth 
wheeled roller. 
401.3.2	
Spreading and Compacting
The sub-base material of the grading specified in the Contract and water shall be mixed 
mechanically by a suitable mixer equipped with provision for controlled addition of water 
and mechanical mixing. So as to ensure homogenous and uniform mix. The required water 
content shall be determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8). The mix shall be spread on 
the prepared subgrade with the help of a motor grader of adequate capacity, its blade having 
hydraulic controls suitable for initial adjustment and for maintaining the required slope and 
grade during the operation, or other means as approved by the Engineer. 
Moisture content of the mix shall be checked in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 2) and suitably 
adjusted so that, at the time of compaction, it is from 1 to 2 percent below the optimum 
moisture content. 
Immediately after spreading the mix, rolling shall be done by an approved roller. If the 
thickness of the compacted layer does not exceed 100 mm, a smooth wheeled roller of 80 to 
100 kN weight may be used. For a compacted single layer upto 200 mm the compaction shall 
be done with the help of a vibratory roller of minimum 80 to 100 kN static weight capable of 
achieving the required compaction. Rolling shall commence at the lower edge and proceed 
towards the upper edge longitudinally for portions having unidirectional crossfall or on super-
elevation. For carriageway having crossfall on both sides, rolling shall commence at the 
edges and progress towards the crown.

LIME  TREATED  SOIL  FOR  IMPROVED  SUB-GRADE/SUB-BASE
402.1	
Scope 
This work shall consist of laying and compacting an improved sub-grade/lower sub-base of 
soil treated with lime on prepared sub-grade in accordance with the requirements of these 
Specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades and cross-sections shown on the 
drawings or as directed by the Engineer. Lime treatment is generally effective for soils which 
contain a relatively high percentage of clay and silty clay.
402.2	
Materials
402.2.1	
Soil
Except when otherwise specified, the soil used for stabilization shall be the local clayey soil 
having a plasticity index greater than 8. 
402.2.2	
Lime
Lime for lime-soil stabilization work shall be commercial dry lime slaked at site or pre-slaked 
lime delivered to the site in suitable packing. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, the 
lime shall have purity of not less than 70 percent by weight of Quick-lime (CaO) when tested 
in accordance with IS:1514. Lime shall be properly stored to avoid prolonged exposure to the 
atmosphere and consequent carbonation which would reduce its binding properties. 
402.2.3	
Quantity of Lime in Stabilized Mix
Quantity of lime to be added as percentage by weight of the dry soil shall be as specified in 
the Contract. The quantity of lime used shall be related to its calcium oxide content which 
shall be specified. Where the lime of different calcium oxide content is to be used, its quantity 
shall be suitably adjusted with the approval of the Engineer so that equivalent calcium oxide 
is incorporated in the work. The mix design shall be done to arrive at the appropriate quantity 
of lime to be added, having due regard to the purity of lime, the type of soil, the moisture-
density relationship, and the design CBR/Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) value 
specified in the Contract. The laboratory CBR/UCS value shall be at least 1.5 times the 
minimum field value of CBR/UCS stipulated in the Contract.
402.2.4	
Water
The water to be used for lime stabilisation shall be clean and free from injurious substances. 
Potable water shall be used.

Equipment for Construction
Stabilised soil sub-bases shall be constructed by mix-in-place method of construction or as 
otherwise approved by the Engineer. Manual mixing shall be permitted only where the width 
of laying is not adequate for mechanical operations, as in small-sized jobs.
The equipment used for mix-in-place construction shall be a rotavator or similar approved 
equipment capable of pulverizing and mixing the soil with additive and water to specified 
degree to the full thickness of the layer being processed, and of achieving the desired degree 
of mixing and uniformity of the stabilized material. If so desired by the Engineer, trial runs with 
the equipment shall be carried out to establish its suitability for work.
The thickness of any layer to be stabilized shall be not less than 100 mm when compacted. The 
maximum thickness can be 200 mm, provided the plant used is accepted by the Engineer.
402.3.4	
Mix-in-place Method of Construction
Before deploying the equipment, the soil after it is made free of undesirable vegetation or 
other deleterious matter shall be spread uniformly on the prepared subgrade in a quantity 
sufficient to achieve the desired compacted thickness of the stabilised layer. Where single-pass 
equipment is to be employed, the soil shall be lightly rolled as directed by the Engineer.



======================================================================
PAGE 133 of 903
======================================================================
Section 400
Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders
114
The equipment used shall either be of single-pass or multiple pass type. The mixers shall be 
equipped with an appropriate device for controlling the depth of processing and the mixing 
blades shall be maintained or reset periodically so that the correct depth of mixing is obtained 
at all times.
With single-pass equipment the forward speed of the machine shall be so selected in relation 
to the rotor speed that the required degree of mixing, pulverisation and depth of processing 
is obtained. In multiple-pass processing, the prepared sub-grade shall be pulverised to the 
required depth with successive passes of the equipment and the moisture content adjusted 
to be within prescribed limits mentioned hereinafter. The lime shall then be spread uniformly 
and mixing continued with successive passes until the required depth and uniformity of 
processing have been obtained.
The mixing equipment shall be so set that it cuts slightly into the edge of the adjoining lane 
processed previously so as to ensure that all the material forming a layer has been properly 
processed for the full width.
402.3.5	
Construction with Manual Means
Where manual mixing is permitted, the soil from borrow areas shall first be freed of all 
vegetation and other deleterious mater and placed on the prepared subgrade. The soil 
shall then be pulverized by means of crow-bars, pick axes or other means approved by the 
Engineer.
Water in requisite quantities may be sprinkled on the soil for aiding pulverisation. On the 
pulverized soil, the lime in requisite quantities shall be spread uniformly and mixed thoroughly 
by working with spades or other similar implements till the whole mass is uniform. After 
adjusting the moisture content to be within the limits mentioned later, the mixed material shall 
be leveled up to the required thickness so that it is ready to be rolled.
402.3.6	
Addition of Lime
Lime may be mixed with the prepared material either in slurry form or dry state at the option 
of the Contractor with the approval of the Engineer.
Dry lime shall be prevented from blowing by adding water to the lime or other suitable means 
selected by the Contractor, with the approval of the Engineer.
The tops of windrowed material may be flattened or slightly trenched to receive the lime.
The distance to which lime may be spread upon the prepared material ahead of the mixing 
operation shall be determined by the Engineer.

Section 400
115
No traffic other than the mixing equipment shall be allowed to pass over the spread lime until 
after completion of mixing.
Mixing or remixing operations, regardless of equipment used, shall continue until the material 
is free of any white streaks or pockets of lime and the mixture is uniform.
Non-uniformity of colour reaction, when the treated material is tested with the standard 
phenolphthalein alcohol indicator, will be considered evidence of inadequate mixing.
402.3.7	
Moisture Content for Compaction
The moisture content at compaction checked vide IS:2720 (Part 2) shall neither be less than 
the optimum moisture content corresponding to IS:2720 (Part 8) nor more than 2 percent 
above it. 
402.3.8	
Rolling
Immediately after spreading, grading and levelling of the mixed material, compaction shall be 
carried out with approved equipment preceded by a few passes of lighter rollers if necessary. 
Rolling shall commence at edges and progress towards the centre, except at super elevated 
portions or for carriageway with unidirectional cross-fall where it shall commence at the inner 
edge and progress towards the outer edge. During rolling, the surface shall be frequently 
checked for grade and crossfall (camber) and any irregularities corrected by loosening the 
material and removing/adding fresh material. Compaction shall continue until the density 
achieved is at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density for the material determined in 
accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8). 
Care shall be taken to see that the compaction of lime stabilised material is completed within 
three hours of its mixing or such shorter period as may be found necessary in dry weather.
During rolling it shall be ensured that roller does not bear directly on hardened or partially 
hardened treated material previously laid other than what may be necessary for achieving the 
specified compaction at the joint. The final surface shall be well closed, free from movement 
under compaction planes, ridges, cracks or loose material. All loose or segregated or otherwise 
defective areas shall be made good to the full thickness of the layer and recompacted.
402.3.9	
Curing
The sub-base course shall be suitably cured for a minimum period of 7 days after which 
subsequent pavement courses shall be laid to prevent the surface from drying out and 
becoming friable. No traffic of any kind shall ply over the completed sub-base unless permitted 
by the Engineer.

404.3	
Construction Operations
404.3.1	
Preparation of Base
The surface of the sub-grade/sub-base/base to receive the water bound macadam course 
shall be prepared to the specified grade and camber and cleaned of dust, dirt and other 
extraneous material. Any ruts or soft yielding places shall be corrected in an approved manner 
and rolled until firm surface is obtained.
Where the WBM is to be laid on an existing metalled road, damaged area including 
depressions and potholes shall be repaired and made good with the suitable material. The 
existing surface shall be scarified and re-shaped to the required grade and camber before 
spreading the coarse aggregate for WBM.
As far as possible, laying water bound macadam course over existing bituminous layer may 
be avoided since it will cause problems of internal drainage of the pavement at the interface 
of two courses. It is desirable to completely pick out the existing thin bituminous wearing 
course where water bound macadam is proposed to be laid over it.
404.3.2	
Inverted Choke/Sub-surface Drainage Layer
If water bound macadam is to be laid directly over the sub-grade, without any other intervening 
pavement course, a 25 mm course of screenings (Grading B) or coarse sand shall be spread 
on the prepared sub-grade before application of the aggregates is taken up. In case of a fine 
sand or silty or clayey sub-grade, it is advisable to lay 100 mm insulating layer of screening 
or coarse sand on top of fine grained soil, the gradation of which will depend upon whether 
it is intended to act as a drainage layer as well. As a preferred alternative to inverted choke, 
appropriate geosynthetics performing functions of separation and drainage may be used 
over the prepared sub-grade as directed by the Engineer. Section 700 shall be applicable for 
use of geosynthetics. 
404.3.3	
Lateral Confinement of Aggregates
For construction of WBM, arrangement shall be made for the lateral confinement of aggregates. 
This shall be done by building adjoining shoulders along with WBM layers. The practice of 
constructing WBM in a trench section excavated in the finished formation must be completely 
avoided. 
Where the WBM course is to be constructed in narrow widths for widening of an existing 
pavement, the existing shoulders should be excavated to their full depth and width up to 
the sub-grade level except where widening specifications envisages laying of a stablised 
sub-base using in-situ operations in which case the same should be removed only up to the 
sub-base level.

Sub-Bases, Bases (Non-Bituminous) and Shoulders
126
404.3.4	
Spreading Coarse Aggregates
The coarse aggregates shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared sub-grade/
sub-base in the required quantities from the stockpiles to proper profile by using templates 
placed across the road about 6 m apart, in such quantities that the thickness of each 
compacted layer is not more than 75 mm. In no case shall these be dumped in heaps directly 
on the area where these are to be laid nor shall their hauling over a partly completed base 
be permitted. Wherever possible, approved mechanical devices such as aggregate spreader 
shall be used to spread the aggregates uniformly so as to minimize the need for manual 
rectification afterwards.
No segregation of coarse aggregates shall be allowed and the coarse aggregates, as spread 
shall be of uniform gradation with no pockets of fine material.
The surface of the aggregates spread shall be carefully checked with templates and all high 
or low spots remedied by removing or adding aggregates as may be required. The surface 
shall be checked frequently with a straight edge while spreading and rolling so as to ensure 
a finished surface as per approved drawings.
The coarse aggregates shall not normally be spread more than 3 days in advance of the 
subsequent construction operations.
404.3.5	
Rolling
Immediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregates, rolling shall be started with 
three wheeled power rollers of 80 to 100 kN capacity or tandem or vibratory rollers of 80 to 
100 kN static weight. The type of roller to be used shall be approved by the Engineer based 
on trial run.
Except on superelevated portions and carriageway with unidirectional cross-fall, where the 
rolling shall proceed from inner edge to the outer, rolling shall begin from the edges gradually 
progressing towards the center. First the edge/edges shall be compacted with roller running 
forward and backward. The roller shall then move inward parallel to the center line of the road, 
in successive passes uniformly overlapping preceding tracks by at least one-half width.
Rolling shall be carried out on courses where coarse aggregates of crushed/ broken stone 
are used, till the road metal is partially compacted. This will be followed by application of 
screenings and binding material where required in Clauses 404.3.6 and 404.3.7. 
However, where screenings are not to be applied as in the case of aggregates like brick 
metal, laterite and Kankar for sub-base construction, the compaction shall be continued until 
the aggregates are thoroughly keyed. Rolling shall be continued and light sprinkling of water 
shall be done till the surface is well compacted.. Rolling shall not be done when the sub-

grade is soft or yielding or when it causes a wave-like motion in the sub-grade or sub-base 
course.
The rolled surface shall be checked transversely with templates and longitudinally with 
3 m straight edge. Any irregularities, exceeding 12 mm, shall be corrected by loosening the 
surface, adding or removing necessary amount of aggregates and re-rolling until the entire 
surface conforms to the desired camber and grade. In no case shall the use of screenings be 
permitted to make up depressions.
Material, which gets crushed excessively during compaction or becomes segregated, shall 
be removed and replaced with suitable aggregates.
404.3.6	
Application of Screenings
After the coarse aggregates have been rolled to Clause 404.3.5, screenings to completely 
fill the interstices shall be applied gradually over the surface. These shall not be damp or wet 
at the time of application. Dry rolling shall be done while the screenings are being spread so 
that vibrations of the roller cause them to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregates. The 
screenings shall not be dumped in piles but be spread uniformly in successive thin layers 
either by the spreading motions of hand shovels or by mechanical spreaders, or directly 
from tipper with suitable grit spreading arrangement. Tipper operating for spreading the 
screenings shall be equipped with pneumatic tyres and operated so as not to disturb the 
coarse aggregates.
The screenings shall be applied at a slow and uniform rate (in three or more applications) so 
as to ensure filling of all voids. This shall be accompanied by dry rolling and brooming with 
mechanical brooms, hand brooms or both. In no case shall the screenings be applied so fast 
and thick as to form cakes or ridges on the surface in such a manner as would prevent filling 
of voids or prevent the direct bearing of the roller on the coarse aggregates. These operations 
shall continue until no more screenings can be forced into voids of the coarse aggregates. 
The spreading, rolling, and brooming of screenings shall be carried out in only such lengths 
of the road which could be completed within one day’s operation.
404.3.7	
Sprinkling of Water and Grouting
After application of screenings, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, swept and 
rolled. Hand brooms shall be used to sweep the wet screenings into voids and to distribute 
them evenly. The sprinkling, sweeping and rolling operation shall be continued, with additional 
screenings applied as necessary until the coarse aggregates have been thoroughly keyed, 
well-bonded and firmly set in its full depth and a grout has been formed of screenings. Care 
shall be taken to see that the sub-base or sub-grade does not get damaged due to the 
addition of excessive quantities of water during construction.

In case of lime treated soil sub-base, construction of water bound macadam on top of it shall 
be taken up after curing as per Clause 402.3.9 and as directed by the Engineer.
Application of binding material : After the application of screenings in accordance 
with Clauses 404.3.6 and 404.3.7, the binding material where it is required to be used 
(Clause 404.2.7) shall be applied successively in two or more thin layers at a slow and uniform 
rate. After each application, the surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water, the resulting 
slurry swept in with hand brooms, or mechanical brooms to fill the voids properly, and rolled 
during which water shall be applied to the wheels of the rollers if necessary to wash down the 
binding material sticking to them. These operations shall continue until the resulting slurry 
after filling of voids, forms a wave ahead of the wheels of the moving roller. 
404.3.8	
Setting and Drying
After the final compaction of water bound macadam course, the pavement shall be allowed 
to dry overnight. Next morning hungry spots shall be filled with screenings or binding material 
as directed, lightly sprinkled with water if necessary and rolled. No traffic shall be allowed on 
the road until the macadam has set. The Engineer shall have the discretion to stop hauling 
traffic from using the completed water bound macadam course, if in his opinion it would 
cause excessive damage to the surface.
The compacted water bound macadam course shall be allowed to completely dry and set 
before the next pavement course is laid over it.

Engineer in accordance with Section 900. 
404.4.3	
The water bound macadam work shall not be carried out when the atmospheric 
temperature is less than 10°C in the shade.
404.4.4	
Reconstruction of Defective Macadam
The finished surface of water bound macadam shall conform to the tolerances of surface 
regularity as prescribed in Clause 902. However, where the surface irregularity of the course 
exceeds the tolerances or where the course is otherwise defective due to sub-grade soil mixing 
with the aggregates, the course to its full thickness shall be scarified over the affected area, 
reshaped with added material or removed and replaced with fresh material as applicable and 
re-compacted. The area treated shall not be less than 10 sq.m. In no case shall depressions 
be filled up with screenings or binding material.

The mix may be spread by a paver finisher. The paver finisher shall be self-propelled of 
adequate capacity with following features:
	
i)	
Loading hoppers and suitable distribution system, so as to provide a 
smooth uninterrupted material flow for different layer thicknesses from 
the tipper to the screed. 
	
ii)	
Hydraulically operated telescopic screed for paving width upto to 
8.5 m and fixed screed beyond this. The screed shall have tamping and 
vibrating arrangement for initial compaction of the layer. 
	
iii)	
Automatic levelling control system with electronic sensing device 
to maintain mat thickness and cross slope of mat during laying 
procedure. 
In exceptional cases where it is not possible for the paver to be utilized, mechanical means 
like motor grader may be used with the prior approval of the Engineer. The motor grader shall 
be capable of spreading the material uniformly all over the surface. 
The surface of the aggregate shall be carefully checked with templates and all high or low 
spots remedied by removing or adding aggregate as may be required. The layer may be 
tested by depth blocks during construction. No segregation of larger and fine particles should 
be allowed. The aggregates as spread should be of uniform gradation with no pockets of fine 
materials.
The Engineer may permit manual mixing and /or laying of wet mix macadam where small 
quantity of wet mix macadam is to be executed. Manual mixing/laying in inaccessible/ remote 
locations and in situations where use of machinery is not feasible can also be permitted. 
Where manual mixing/laying is intended to be used, the same shall be done with the approval 
of the Engineer.
406.3.5	
Compaction
After the mix has been laid to the required thickness, grade and crossfall/camber the same 
shall be uniformly compacted to the full depth with suitable roller. If the thickness of single 
compacted layer does not exceed 100 mm, a smooth wheel roller of 80 to 100kN weight 
may be used. For a compacted single layer upto 200 mm, the compaction shall be done with 
the help of vibratory roller of minimum static weight of 80 to 100 kN with an arrangement

for adjusting the frequency and amplitude. An appropriate frequency and amplitude may be 
selected. The speed of the roller shall not exceed 5 km/h.
In portions having unidirectional cross fall/superelevation, rolling shall commence from the 
lower edge and progress gradually towards the upper edge. Thereafter, roller should progress 
parallel to the center line of the road, uniformly over-lapping each preceding track by at least 
one-third width until the entire surface has been rolled. Alternate trips of the roller shall be 
terminated in stops at least 1 m away from any preceding stop.
In portions in camber, rolling should begin at the edge with the roller running forward and 
backward until the edges have been firmly compacted. The roller shall then progress gradually 
towards the center parallel to the center line of the road uniformly overlapping each of the 
preceding track by at least one-third width until the entire surface has been rolled.
Any displacement occurring as a result of reversing of the direction of a roller or from any 
other cause shall be corrected at once as specified and/or removed and made good.
Along forms, kerbs, walls or other places not accessible to the roller, the mixture shall be 
thoroughly compacted with mechanical tampers or a plate compactor. Skin patching of an 
area without scarifying the surface to permit proper bonding of the added material shall not 
be permitted.
Rolling should not be done when the sub-grade is soft or yielding or when it causes a wave-
like motion in the sub-base/base course or sub-grade. If irregularities develop during rolling 
which exceed 12 mm when tested with a 3 m straight edge, the surface should be loosened 
and premixed material added or removed as required before rolling again so as to achieve 
a uniform surface conforming to the desired grade and crossfall. In no case shall the use of 
unmixed material be permitted to make up the depressions.
Rolling shall be continued till the density achieved is at least 98 percent of the maximum dry 
density for the material as determined by the method outlined in IS:2720 (Part-8).
After completion, the surface of any finished layer shall be well-closed, free from movement 
under compaction equipment or any compaction planes, ridges, cracks and loose material. 
All loose, segregated or otherwise defective areas shall be made good to the full thickness of 
the layer and recompacted.

Both the highest daily mean air temperature and the lowest daily mean air temperatures 
mentioned in Tables 500-5 and 500-6 can be obtained for the weather station nearest to 
the project site from the Indian Meteorological Organization (IMO). This daily mean high 
temperature on a specific day is the same as daily “normal” high temperature for that 
day as usually reported in some newspapers. The highest of the 365 daily mean high air 
temperatures (which usually occurs on some day in May or June) is used in Tables 500-5 and 
500-6. Likewise, the lowest daily mean air temperature (which usually occurs on some day in 
January) can also be obtained from the IMO. Since these are mean temperatures based on 
the average of 30-40 years data, these temperatures are significantly lower than the absolute 
maximum temperatures, which may have occurred in a specific year.
501.2.2	
Coarse Aggregates
The coarse aggregates shall consist of crushed rock, crushed gravel or other hard material 
retained on the 2.36 mm sieve. They shall be clean, hard, durable, of cubical shape, free from 
dust and soft or friable matter, organic or other deleterious matter. Where the Contractor’s 
selected source of aggregates has poor affinity for bitumen, the Contractor shall demonstrate 
through test results that with the use of anti-stripping agents, the stripping value is improved 
to satisfy the specification requirements. The Engineer may approve such a source and, as 
a condition for the approval of that source, the bitumen shall be treated with approved anti-
stripping agents, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations, at the cost of the Contractor.
Where crushed gravel is proposed for use as aggregate not less than 90 percent by weight 
of the crushed material retained on the 4.75 mm sieve shall have at least two fractured 
faces, except that in the case of bituminous concrete the requirement in this regard shall be 
95 percent. .
The aggregates shall satisfy the physical requirements set forth in the individual relevant 
clause for the material.
501.2.3	
Fine Aggregates
Fine aggregates shall consist of crushed or naturally occurring material, or a combination of 
the two, passing 2.36 mm sieve and retained on the 75 micron sieve. They shall be clean,

hard, durable, dry and free from dust, and soft or friable matter, organic or other deleterious 
matter. Natural sand shall not be allowed in binder and wearing courses. However, natural 
sand upto 50 percent of the fine aggregates may be allowed in base courses. Fine aggregates 
shall have a sand equivalent value of not less than 50 when tested in accordance with the 
requirement of IS:2720 (Part 37). The plasticity index of the fraction passing 0.425 mm shall 
not exceed 4 when tested in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 5). The fine aggregates shall 
satisfy the physical requirements set forth in the individual relevant-clause for the material in 
question. 
501.2.4	
Sources of Material
The sources of materials proposed to be used by the Contractor shall be tested to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer who shall give the necessary approval. The Engineer may from 
time to time withdraw approval of a specific source, or attach conditions to the existing 
approval. Any change in aggregate source for bituminous mixes shall require a new mix 
design, and laying trials, where the mix is based on a job mix design. Stockpiles from different 
sources, approved or otherwise, shall be kept separate, such that there is no contamination 
between one material and another. Each source submitted for approval shall contain material 
sufficient for at least 5 days’ work.
501.3	
Mixing
Pre-mixed bituminous materials shall be prepared in a hot mix plant of adequate capacity and 
capable of yielding a mix of proper and uniform quality with thoroughly coated aggregates. 
Appropriate mixing temperatures are given in Table 500-2 of these Specifications. the 
difference in temperature between the binder and aggregate shall at no time exceed 14ºC. In 
order to ensure uniform quality of the mix and better coating of aggregates, the hot mix plant 
shall be calibrated from time to time. The essential features of the hot mix plants are given in

If a continuous type mixing plant is used, the Contractor must demonstrate by laboratory 
analysis that the cold feed combined grading is within the grading limits specified for that 
bituminous bound material. In the case of a designed job mix, the bitumen and filler content 
shall be derived using this combined grading. 
501.4	
Transporting
Bituminous materials shall be transported in clean insulated and covered vehicles. An asphalt 
release agent, such as soap or lime water, may be applied to the interior of the vehicle to 
prevent sticking and to facilitate discharge of the material.
501.5	
Laying
501.5.1	
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Laying shall be suspended:
	
i)	
In presence of standing water on the surface;
	
ii)	
When rain is imminent, and during rains, fog or dust storm;
	
iii)	
When the base/binder course is damp;
	
iv)	
When the air temperature on the surface on which it is to be laid is less 
than 10ºC for mixes with conventional bitumen and is less than 15ºC for 
mixes with modified bitumen;

Spreading
Prior to spreading the mix, the base shall be prepared by carrying out the required operations 
as per Clause 501.8 depending upon the site conditions. Except in areas where paver cannot 
get access, bituminous materials shall be spread, levelled and tamped by an approved self-
propelled paving machine equipped with an electronic sensing device. The essential features 
of the paver finisher shall conform to Annex A of IRC:27. As soon as possible after arrival 
at site, the materials shall be supplied continuously to the paver and laid without delay. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 172 of 903
======================================================================
Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)
Section 500
153
rate of delivery of material to the paver shall be regulated to enable the paver to operate 
continuously. The travel rate of the paver, and its method of operations, shall be adjusted 
to ensure an even and uniform flow of bituminous material across the screed, free from 
dragging, tearing and segregation of the material. In areas with restricted space (such as 
confined space, foot ways, of irregular shape and varying thickness, approaches to expansion 
joints, etc.) where paver cannot be used, the material shall be spread, raked and levelled with 
suitable hand tools by trained staff.
The minimum thickness of material laid in each paver pass shall be in accordance with 
the minimum values given in the relevant parts of these Specifications. When laying binder 
course or wearing course approaching an expansion joint of a structure, machine laying 
shall stop 300 mm short of the joint. The remainder of the pavement up to the joint, and the 
corresponding area beyond it, shall be laid by hand, and the joint or joint cavity shall be kept 
clear of surfacing material. 
Bituminous material, with a temperature greater than 145°C, shall not be laid or deposited 
on bridge deck water-proofing systems, unless precautions against heat damage have been 
approved by the Engineer.
501.5.4	
Cleanliness and Overlaying
Bituminous material shall be kept clean and uncontaminated. The only traffic permitted to run 
on bituminous material to be overlaid shall be that engaged in laying and compacting the next 
course or, where a binder course is to be sealed or surface dressed, that engaged on such 
surface treatment. Should any bituminous material become contaminated, the Contractor 
shall make it good to the satisfaction of the Engineer, in compliance with Clause 501.8.
Binder course material shall be covered by either the wearing course or surface treatment, 
whichever is specified in the Contract.
501.6	
Compaction
Bituminous materials shall be laid and compacted in layers, which enable the specified 
thickness, surface level, regularity requirements and compaction to be achieved.
Compaction of bituminous materials shall commence as soon as possible after laying. 
Compaction shall be substantially completed before the temperature falls below the minimum 
rolling temperatures stated in the relevant part of these Specifications. Rolling of the 
longitudinal joints shall be done immediately behind the paving operation. After this, rolling 
shall commence at the edges and progress towards the center longitudinally except that on 
super-elevated and unidirectionally cambered portions, it shall progress from the lower to the 
upper edge parallel to the center line of the pavement. Rolling shall continue until all roller 
marks have been removed from the surface. All deficiencies in the surface after laying shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 173 of 903
======================================================================
Section 500
Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)
154
be made good by the attendants behind the paver, before initial rolling is commenced. The 
initial or breakdown rolling shall be done with 8–10 tonne static weight smooth-wheel rollers. 
The intermediate rolling shall be done with 8–10 tonne static weight or vibratory roller or with 
a pneumatic tyre roller of 12 to 15 tonne weight, with a tyre pressure of at least 0.56 MPa. 
The Contractor shall demonstrate the efficiency of the equipment proposed to be used by 
carrying compaction trials. The procedure for site trials shall be submitted to the Engineer 
for approval. The finish rolling shall be done with 6 to 8 tonne smooth wheel tandem rollers. 
Rolling shall continue until the specified compaction is achieved.
Where compaction is to be determined by density of cores, the requirements to prove the 
performance of rollers shall apply in order to demonstrate that the specified density can be 
achieved. In such cases the Contractor shall specify the plant, and the method by which he 
intends to achieve the specified level of compaction and finish at temperatures above the 
minimum specified rolling temperature. Laying trials shall then demonstrate the acceptability 
of the plant and method used.
Bituminous materials shall be rolled in a longitudinal direction, with the driven rolls nearest 
the paver. The roller shall first compact material adjacent to joints and then work from the 
lower to the upper side of the layer, overlapping on successive passes by at least one-third of 
the width of the rear roll or, in the case of a pneumatic-tyred roller, at least the nominal width 
of 300 mm.
In portions with super-elevated and unidirectional camber, after the edge has been rolled, the 
roller shall progress from the lower to the upper edge.
Rollers should move at a speed of not more than 5 km per hour. The roller shall not be permitted 
to stand on pavement which has not been fully compacted, and necessary precautions shall 
be taken to prevent dropping of oil, grease, petrol/ diesel or other foreign matter on the 
pavement either when the rollers are operating or standing. The wheels of roller machine 
shall be in good working order, to prevent the mix from adhering to the wheels. Only sufficient 
moisture to prevent adhesion between the wheels of rollers and the mix should be used. 
Surplus water shall not be allowed to stand on the partially compacted pavement.
501.7	
Joints
501.7.1	
Where joints are made, the material shall be fully compacted and the joint 
made flush in one of the following ways:
	
a)	
All joints shall be cut vertical to the full thickness of the previously laid 
mix. All loosened material shall be discarded and the vertical face 
coated with a suitable viscosity grade hot bitumen, or cold applied 
emulsified bitumen. While spreading the material along the joint the 
material spread shall overlap 25 mm to 50 mm on the previously laid 
mix beyond the vertical face of the joint. The thickness of the loose 



======================================================================
PAGE 174 of 903
======================================================================
Bases and Surface Courses (Bituminous)
Section 500
155
overlap material should be approximately a quarter more than the final 
compacted thickness. The overlapped mix shall be dragged back to the 
hot lane so that the roller can press the small excess into the hot side 
of the joint to obtain a high joint density.
	
b)	
By using two or more pavers operating in echelon, where this is 
practicable and in sufficient proximity for adjacent widths to be fully 
compacted by continuous rolling. 
501.7.2	
All longitudinal joints shall be offset at least 300 mm from parallel joints in the 
layer beneath or as directed, and in a layout approved by the Engineer. Joints in the wearing 
course shall coincide with either the lane edge or the lane marking, whichever is appropriate. 
Longitudinal joints shall not be situated in wheel track zones.
501.7.3	
For transverse joints method a) above shall apply. Transverse joints in the 
successive and adjoining layers shall have a minimum offset of 2 m.

To determine this combined proportion, the flaky stone from a representative sample 
should first be separated out. Flakiness index is weight of flaky stone metal divided by 
weight of stone sample. Only the elongated particles be separated out from the remaining 
(non-flaky) stone metal. Elongation index is weight of elongated particles divided by total 
non-flaky particles. The values of flakiness index and elongation index so found are added 
up.

Application of Slurry Seal
A calibrated slurry seal machine, as per requirements of job mix, shall be used to spread the 
material. The surface shall be pre-wetted by fogging ahead of the spreader box (if required 
under hot weather conditions). The rate of application shall be adjusted during the day to suit 
temperature, surface texture and humidity. The mixture shall be agitated and mixed uniformly 
in the spreader box by means of twin shafted paddles or spiral augurs fixed in spreader box. 
A front seal shall be provided to ensure no loss of the mixture at the road contact point. The 
rear seal shall act as final strike off and shall be adjustable. The spreader box and real strike 
off shall be so designed and operated that a uniform consistency is achieved to produce free 
flow of material to the rear strike off. A secondary strike off shall have the same adjustment 
as the spreader box. The spreader box shall have the suitable means provided to side shift 
the box to compensate for variation in pavement geometry. Sufficient amount of material 
shall be carried in all parts of spreader box at all times so that a complete coverage is 
obtained. Overloading of the spreader box shall be avoided. No lumping, balling and unmixed 
aggregates shall be permitted. No streak, caused by oversized aggregates shall be left on the 
finished surface. Longitudinal joints shall correspond with the edges of existing traffic lanes. 
Other patterns of longitudinal joints may be permitted, if pattern will not adversely affect the 
quality of finished surface. In case streak is formed, it shall be corrected immediately by fresh 
material and with use of squeeze. Longitudinal joints, common to two traffic lanes shall be 
butt joints with overlap not exceeding an average of 60-100 mm. The mixture shall be uniform 
and homogeneous after spreading on existing surfaces and shall not show separation of the 
emulsion and aggregates after setting.

516.4.2	
Preparation of the Base
The base on which mastic asphalt is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and conditioned 
to the profile required, in accordance with Clause 501 or 902 as appropriate or as directed 
by the Engineer. In the case of a cement concrete base, the surface shall be thoroughly 
power brushed clean and free of dust and other deleterious matter. Under no circumstances 
shall mastic asphalt be spread on a base containing a binder which might soften under high 
application temperatures. If such material exists, the same shall be cut out and repaired 
before the mastic asphalt is laid.
516.4.3	
Tack Coat
A tack coat in accordance with Clause 503 shall be applied on the base or as directed by the 
Engineer.
516.4.4	
Preparation of Mastic Asphalt
Preparation of mastic asphalt consists of two stages. The first stage shall be mixing of filler and 
fine aggregates and then heating the mixture to a temperature of 170°C to 210°C. Required 
quantity of bitumen shall be heated to 170°C to 180°C and added to the heated aggregated. 
They shall be mixed and cooked in an approved type of mechanically agitated mastic cooker 
for some time till the materials are thoroughly mixed. Initially the filler alone is to be heated 
in the cooker for an hour and then half the quantity of binder is added. After heating and 
mixing for some time, the fine aggregates and the balance of binder are to be added and 
further cooked for about one hour. The second stage is incorporation of coarse aggregates 
and cooking the mixtures for a total period of 3 hours. During cooking and mixing care shall 
be taken to ensure that the contents in the cooker are at no time heated to a temperature 
exceeding 210°C.
Where the material is not required for immediate use it shall be cast into blocks consisting 
of filler, fine aggregates and binder, but without the addition of coarse aggregate, weighing 
about 25 kg each. Before use, these blocks shall be reheated to a temperature of not less 
than 175°C and not more than 210°C, thoroughly incorporated with the requisite quantity of 
coarse aggregates and mixed continuously. Mixing shall be continued until laying operations 
are completed so as to maintain the coarse aggregates in suspension. At no stage during the 
process of mixing shall the temperature exceed 210°C.
The mastic asphalt blocks (without coarse aggregate) shall show on analysis a composition 
within the limits as given in Table 500-42.
The mix shall be transported to the laying site in a towed mixer transporter having arrangements 
for stirring and keeping the mix hot during transportation.

The mastic asphalt shall be laid, normally in one coat, at a temperature between 175°C and 
210°C and spread uniformly by hand using wooden floats or by machine on the prepared 
surface. The thickness of the mastic asphalt and the percentage of added coarse aggregate 
shall be in accordance with Table 500-40 or as specified by the Engineer. Where necessary, 
battens of the requisite dimensions should be employed. Any blow holes that appear in the 
surface shall be punctured while the material is hot, and the surface made good by further 
floating.
Laying surface over existing bridge deck : Before laying bitumen over existing bridge 
deck, the existing cross fall/camber, expansion joint members and water drainage spouts 
shall be carefully examined for their proper functioning in the bridge deck structure and any 
deficiency found shall be removed. Loose elements in the expansion joint shall be firmly 
secured. The existing wearing coat shall be removed, as per Clause 2809. The cracks in the 
concrete surface, if any, shall be repaired and filled up properly or replaced by new concrete 
of specified grade before laying the bitumen mastic over bridge deck.
Laying over new bridge deck : New concrete bridge deck which is not in camber/cross fall 
shall first be provided with required camber and cross fall by suitable concrete or bituminous 
treatment. 
Treatment where mastic asphalt is laid over a concrete surface : In case of laying over 
concrete surface, following measures shall be taken :
	
1)	
For proper bond with new concrete deck, surface shall be roughened 
by means of stiff broom or wire brush and it shall be free from ridges 
and troughs.
	
2)	
A thin bituminous tack coat (with bitumen of grade VG 30) shall be 
applied on the concrete deck before pouring mastic. The deck shall be 
dry. The quantity of bitumen for tack coat shall be as per Table 500-6.
	
3)	
After applying tack coat, chicken-mesh reinforcement of 1.5 mm dia 
steel wire with hexagonal or rectangular openings of 20-25 mm shall 
be placed and held properly in position on the concrete surface before 
pouring mastic.
516.4.6	
Joints
All construction joints shall be properly and truly made. These joints shall be made by warming 
existing mastic asphalt by the application of an excess quantity of the hot mastic asphalt mix 
which afterwards shall be trimmed to leave it flush with the surfaces on either side.

While working out the job mix formula, the Contractor shall ensure that it is based on a 
correct and truly representative sample of the materials that will actually be used in the work 
and that the mix and its different ingredients satisfy the physical and strength requirements 
of these Specifications.
Approval of the job mix formula shall be based on independent testing by the Engineer 
for which samples selected jointly with the Engineer of all ingredients of the mix shall be 
furnished by the Contractor as required by the former.
The approved job mix formula shall remain effective unless and until modified by the

Construction operations
518.2.3.1	
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Construction with cold mix must not be undertaken when ambient temperatures below 10°C 
are expected, during rain, in standing water, or generally when poor weather is predicted. 
Bitumen emulsions and cutbacks depend on the evaporation of water and/or solvent for 
the development of their curing and adhesion characteristics. Cold weather, rain and high 
humidity slow down the rate of curing. Extra manipulation may be required to remove volatiles 
in cool and humid conditions. Wind increases the rate of evaporation.
518.2.3.2	
Preparation of the Base
The base on which cold mix is to be laid shall be prepared, shaped and levelled to the required 
profile in accordance with Clauses 501 and 902 as appropriate, and a prime coat, where 
specified, shall be applied in accordance with Clause 502 or as directed by the Engineer.

from the mixer to the road site shall suit to the Contractor’s proposed laying procedure 
methodology.
518.2.3.5	
Spreading
Designed cold mix shall be placed by a paver or grader as specified in the Contract. The mix 
shall not be placed on any wet surface or when weather conditions will otherwise prevent its 
proper handling or finishing.
If spreading by motor grader, the grader shall have a blade that is straight and sharp and long 
enough to ensure finishing to close, straight, transverse tolerances and all joints and linkages 
must be in good condition. The grader must be heavy enough to hold the blade firmly and 
uniformly on the surface while spreading the mix.
If climatic conditions and aggregate grading do not permit evaporation of moisture or volatiles 
without aeration by manipulation, a grader shall be used to place designed cold mix.
Other methods of spreading may be used as approved by the Engineer.
518.2.3.6	
Compaction
Initial compaction of the laid material shall preferably be carried out using a pneumatic-
tyred roller of a weight appropriate to the layer thickness to be compacted with single layer 
thickness being 25-100 mm and all compaction being in accordance with Clauses 501.6 and 
501.7. Smooth tyres shall be used. Final rolling and smoothening of the surface should be 
completed using steel wheel rollers. The Contractor shall demonstrate at laying trials that his 
proposed laying and compaction methods can achieve a satisfactory result.

RECYCLING  OF  BITUMINOUS  PAVEMENT
519.1	
Scope
This work covers the recycling of existing bituminous pavement materials to upgrade an 
existing bituminous pavement which has served its initially intended purpose. The work shall 
be performed on such widths and lengths as shall be directed by the Engineer and may 
consist of pavement removal, stockpiling of materials from the old pavement, addition of 
new bitumen and untreated aggregates in the requisite proportions, mixing, spreading and 
compaction of the blended materials.
These specifications cover the hot process. 
519.2	
Reclaimed Bituminous Materials for Central Plant Recycling
519.2.1	
The reclaimed bituminous material shall be used in the production of 
bituminous macadam and dense bituminous macadam subject to the Clauses 519.2.3 to 
519.2.8, and subject to satisfactory completion of full investigations in respect of all related 
materials entirely at the Contractor’s cost and subject to the approval of the Engineer. For

243
estimation purposes, an amount not greater than 60 per cent of reclaimed bituminous material 
shall be assumed. 
519.2.2	
Materials for Recycled Pavement
The recycled materials shall be a blend of reclaimed and new materials proportioned to 
achieve a paving mixture with the specified engineering properties. The reclaimed materials 
shall be tested and evaluated to find the optimum blend meeting the mixture requirements. 
Such testing and evaluation shall be carried out on representative sample, either cores 
sampled from the carriageway or samples taken from stockpiles in accordance with current 
practice. The sampling frequency should be sufficient to determine how consistent the 
reclaimed material is and to provide representative samples for composition analysis and 
measurement of properties of recovered binder. As an absolute minimum, one sample to 
represent 500 m two lane carriageway shall be taken.
519.2.3	
Bitumen Extraction
The procedure described in ASTM D-2172 shall be used to quantitatively separate aggregates 
and bitumen from any representative sample of reclaimed bituminous pavement.
519.2.4	
Aggregate Evaluation
Mechanical sieve analysis (IS:2386, Part I, wet sieving method) shall be performed on the 
aggregate portion of the reclaimed bituminous pavement sample to determine the grading. It 
is essential that the reclaimed materials to be recycled are consistent, as variable materials 
will cause problems with the control of quality and impede the efficiency of the recycling 
operation. Suitable sources of consistent material either in existing pavements, from stockpiled 
of known origin or from another suitable source shall be identified before a decision can be 
made on the optimum percentage of reclaimed material.
After selecting the proportion of reclaimed materials to be recycled, the grading of the mixture 
may need adjustment, to meet Specification requirements, by the addition of selected 
aggregate sizes.
519.2.5	
Evaluation of Bitumen
When the amount of reclaimed bituminous materials to be used in the mixture exceeds 
10 percent, the penetration value of the recovered binder from the reclaimed bituminous 
material, before mixing, shall exceed 15 pen, after recovery of binder in accordance with the 
requirements of BS:2000:Part 397, when tested in accordance with IS:1203. Provided the

above requirement is met, hardening of the old binder, during the original mixing process or 
through ageing, can be compensated for by adding softer bitumen, to obtain the appropriate 
final grade of binder.
The determination of the type and amount of binder required to be added in the final mix is 
essentially a trial and error procedure.
After mixing with recycled materials, the binder recovered from the mixture shall have a 
recovered penetration value not less than the value specified in Table 500-48.

Rejuvenators
The use of rejuvenators, and a test to measure their effectiveness, is given in 
Clause 519.6.3.
519.2.7	
Untreated Aggregates
If necessary, fresh untreated aggregates shall be added to the reclaimed bituminous pavement 
to produce a mix with the desired grading. The aggregate shall be checked for quality 
requirements in accordance with Table 500-7 or Table 500-10 as appropriate. Reclaimed 
aggregate, if any, or any aggregate normally used for the desired bituminous mix, or both, 
may be used for this purpose.
519.2.8	
Combined Aggregate Grading
The blend reclaimed and new aggregate shall meet the grading criteria specified in the 
relevant parts of Clauses 505 or 506, as appropriate and as approved by the Engineer. The 
blend of aggregates shall be checked for resistance to stripping as specified in Tables 500-7 
or 500-10 as appropriate.

Mixture Design
The combined aggregate grading and binder content shall comply with the relevant tables in 
Clauses 504 or 505 as appropriate. The mix design shall also comply with the requirements 
of Table 500-10. There may be a variation on three to four sieves with respect to percent 
passing, the permissible variation shall not exceed 3 to 4 percent per sieve.
519.4	
Reclaiming Old Pavement Materials
The removal of pavement materials to the required depth shall be accomplished either at 
ambient temperature (cold process) or at an elevated temperature (hot process), as approved 
by the Engineer.
519.4.1	
Cold  Removal Process
In the cold process, the ripping and crushing operations shall be carried out using scarifiers, 
grid rollers, or rippers or by any other means as directed by the Engineer. The removed 
materials shall be loaded and hauled for crushing to the required size as directed by the 
Engineer. Alternatively, cold milling or planning machines can be used to reclaim bituminous 
pavement to controlled depths. Thereafter the bituminous layers are removed, any remaining 
aggregate materials that are to be incorporated in the recycled hot mix shall be scarified 
and removed. When the pavement material removal is completed, any drainage deficiencies 
shall be corrected. After that, the base/sub-base, as the case may be, shall be cut, graded 
and compacted to the required profile and density.
519.4.2	
Hot Removal Process
In the hot process, the road surface shall be heated, by infra-red/ hot-air heating system, 
before scarification. A self propelled plant fitted with suitable arrangement for heating the 
existing bituminous surface shall be used. A milling drum shall follow the planer for removing 
the heated soft bituminous layer. The depth, width and speed of travel shall be adjusted 
to suit specific requirements as directed by the Engineer. During the heating process, the 
surface temperature of the road shall not exceed 200°C for more than 5 minutes.
519.4.3	
Stockpiling
In the cold process, the reclaimed bituminous pavement material shall be stockpiled with 
height of stockpiles not exceeding 3 m. The reclaimed untreated aggregate base/sub-base 
material shall be stockpiled in the same manner as new aggregate. The number and location 
of stockpiles shall be carefully planned for efficient operation of the hot-mix plant.

the requirements of Clauses 504.3 or 505.4, as appropriate shall apply.
519.6	
In Situ Recycling – The Remix and Repave Processes
519.6.1	
Scope
In the process of repaving, the existing surface is preheated and scarified but the scarified 
material is not removed. A layer of fresh bituminous mix material prepared in the integrated 
mixing unit of the plant is then spread evenly on the scarified surface to give a uniform profile. 
The spread material should be compacted as soon as possible after laying. In the process, 
the total thickness of the pavement is increased by up to 50 mm.
In the remix process, the scarified material should be taken from the mixing unit of the plant 
where it is recycled with fresh binder, aggregate and recycling agent. Then the recycled 
mixture is spread on the preheated surface and tamped and compacted to the required 
profile. 
519.6.2	
Heating and Scarifying
Surfaces to be treated shall be heated by plant with surfaces insulated and fully enclosed. 
The heated width of surfacing shall exceed the scarified width by at least 75 mm on each 
side, except against the edge of the carriageway or kerb face. When new surfacing material 
is spilled onto the road surface it shall be removed before the existing surface is heated and 
scarified. Areas of unscarified material shall not exceed 50 mm x 50 mm. 
The depth of scarification shall be such that the bottom of the scarified layer is parallel to and 
below the finished road surface level by the thickness of wearing course material specified. 
A tolerance of ±6 mm is permissible.
Where street furniture and other obstructions occur, these shall be suitably protected or 
removed and the void covered. Surface dressing and large areas of road markings shall be 
removed by milling, planning scarifying or by similar approved processes.
The heated surface shall be evenly scarified to comply with the requirements of this Clause. 
When street furniture is left in place or raised, the adjacent area shall be scarified by other 
means, with the material either left in place or removed, prior to passage of the machine. If 
furniture needs to be repositioned on completion of work, the new wearing course material 
shall be used to make good the road surface for a maximum width of 200 mm around the 
obstruction.

During the reheating process, the surface temperature of the road shall not exceed 200°C for 
more than 5 minutes.
519.6.3	
Rejuvenator
For Remix, when required, rejuvenator shall be uniformly sprayed across the fullwidth of 
the processed material. The machine shall incorporate a metre for continuous verification of 
quantities which shall be within ±5% of the specified rate. The volume of rejuvenator shall 
vary in relation to the operating speed of the machine, which shall be related to the volume 
of material mixed or scarified. 
The rejuvenator shall be a non-emulsified aromatic extract. Its properties shall be verified 
using the Rolling Thin Film Oven Test.
Rejuvenation of the existing pavement may also be performed by adding new hot-mix 
bituminous material containing a soft binder for restoring the binder in the existing pavement 
to the required viscosity. Use of rejuvenating oil may be resorted to in case the target values 
of viscosity, penetration and softening are not met.
519.6.4	
Mixing
When required, new hot-mix material shall be mixed with the heated and scarified road 
pavement material in a pugmill within the Remix machine, observing the mixing temperatures 
specified in Table 500-2.
After mixing, the recycled bituminous materials shall be automatically led to a finishing unit, 
which spreads and levels the mixture to the specified thickness and cross-section. The new 
bituminous concrete wearing course shall comply with Clause 507.
519.6.5	
Additional Material (General)
The proportion of new hot-mix bituminous material, and the proportion of existing bituminous 
pavement material shall be as directed by the Engineer, together with the amount the road 
surface level is to be raised (if any).
The type and quantity of the new hot-mix material shall be determined by using the 
Marshall Mix Design procedure specified in the Asphalt Institute Manual MS-2, before work 
commences. Remix designs shall incorporate the stated proportion of material sampled from 
the existing road surface.
When additional coarse or fine aggregate or filler are required to be added, they shall comply 
with the requirements of Clause 508.2. The amount of additional coarse or fine aggregate 
or filler to be added to the existing bituminous pavement material shall be notified to the 
Engineer.

New surfacing material shall be bituminous concrete wearing course complying with 
Clause 508, or other wearing course material approved by the Engineer.
The new surfacing material shall be laid on, and compacted with, the reprofiled surfacing, 
which shall be at a temperature within the range of 100ºC to 150ºC.
519.6.8	
Binder
The binder shall be recovered from samples taken from each layer of material laid. The 
method of recovery shall be in accordance with BS:2000: Part 397 or an equivalent test. The 
penetration of the binder shall be in the range 35-70 pen.
519.6.9	
Mixture Design
The surfacing material shall be sampled from the paver hopper or augers. Care shall be 
taken that only the material forming the new surface layer is sampled. The sample shall be 
reduced at site by rifling or quartering to approximately 5 kg and placed loose in an air-tight 
container.
The sample shall only be reheated once whilst within the container. As soon as the sample 
reaches the required temperature, the reheated material shall be remixed and three Marshall 
test specimens prepared in accordance with the procedures specified in MS-2.
The bulk density of each specimen shall be measured before Marshall Stability testing. The 
mean stability and flow of the three specimen measured in accordance with the procedures 
specified in MS-2, shall comply with the requirements of Table 500-11.
The three Marshall specimens shall be combined and the maximum theoretical specific 
gravity (Gmm) of the mix shall be determined in accordance with ASTM D 2041. This maximum 
theoretical specific gravity (Gmm) corresponds to 0% air voids in the mix. The percent air voids 
(Pa) in the specimen of the compacted mixture given by Pa=(Gmm–Gmbx100)/Gmm shall meet 
the requirements of air voids laid down in Table 500-10, where Gmb is the actual bulk specific 
gravity of a Marshall specimen determined in the Laboratory.

Specifications and other relevant IS Specifications.
601.3	
Proportioning of Materials for the Mix
601.3.1	
The mix shall be proportioned with a maximum aggregate cementitious 
material  ratio of 15:1. The water content shall be adjusted to the optimum as per 
Clause 601.3.2 for facilitating compaction by rolling. The strength and density requirements 
of concrete shall be determined in accordance with Clauses 601.7 and 601.8 by making trial 
mixes. Care should be taken to prevent one size of aggregate falling into the other size of the 
hopper of the feeding bin while loading the individual size of aggregates into the bins.
601.3.2	
Moisture Content
The optimum water content shall be determined and demonstrated by rolling during trial 
length construction and the optimum moisture content and degree of compaction shall be 
got approved from Engineer. While laying in the main work, the lean concrete shall have 
a moisture content between the optimum and optimum +2 percent, keeping in view the 
effectiveness of compaction achieved and to compensate for evaporation losses.
601.3.3	
Cement Content
The cement content in the dry lean concrete shall be such that the strength specified in 
Clause 601.3.4 is achieved. The minimum cement content shall be 150 kg/cu.m of concrete. 
In case flyash is blended at site as part replacement of cement, the quantity of flyash shall 
not be more than 20 percent by weight of cementitious material and the content of OPC shall 
not be less than 120 kg/cu.m.
If this minimum is not sufficient to produce dry lean concrete of the specified strength, it shall 
be increased as necessary by the Contractor at his own cost.
601.3.4	
Concrete Strength
The average compressive strength of each consecutive group of 5 cubes made in accordance 
with Clause 903.5.1.1 shall not be less than 10 MPa at 7 days. In addition, the minimum 
compressive strength of any individual cube shall not be less than 7.5 MPa at 7 days. The 
design mix complying with the above Clauses shall be got approved from the Engineer and 
demonstrated in the trial length construction.
601.4	
Sub-grade
The sub-grade shall conform to the grades and cross-sections shown on the drawings and 
shall be laid and compacted in accordance with Clause 305. The subgrade strength shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 277 of 903
======================================================================
Section 600
Concrete Pavement
258
correspond to the design strength specified in the Contract. As far as possible, the construction 
traffic shall be avoided on the prepared sub-grade.
601.5	
Drainage Layer
A drainage layer conforming to Clause 401 shall be laid above the subgrade before laying the 
Dry Lean Concrete sub-base, as specified in the drawings and the Contract.
601.6	
Construction
601.6.1	
General
The Dry Lean Concrete shall be laid on the prepared granular drainage layer. The pace and 
programme of the Dry Lean Concrete  sub-base construction shall be matching suitably 
with the programme of construction of the cement concrete pavement over it. The Dry Lean 
Concrete sub-base shall be overlaid with concrete pavement only after 7 days of sub-base 
construction.
601.6.2	
Batching and Mixing
The batching plant shall be capable of proportioning the materials by weight, each type 
of material being weighed separately in accordance with Clauses 602.9.2, 602.9.3.1 and 
602.9.3.2.
The design features of Batching Plant should be such that the plant can be shifted quickly.
601.6.3	
Transporting
Plant mix lean concrete shall be discharged immediately from the mixer, transported directly 
to the point where it is to be laid and protected from the weather by covering the tipping 
trucks with tarpaulin during transit. The concrete shall be transported by tipping trucks, 
sufficient in number to ensure a continuous supply of material to feed the laying equipment 
to work at a uniform speed and in an uninterrupted manner. The lead of the batching plant to 
paving site shall be such that the travel time available from mixing to paving as specified in 
Clause 601.6.5.2 will be adhered to. Tipping truck shall not have old concrete sticking to it. 
Each tipping truck shall be washed with water jet before next loading as and when required 
after inspection.
601.6.4	
Placing
Lean concrete shall be placed by a paver with electronic sensor on the drainage layer or as 
specified in the Contract. The equipment shall be capable of laying the material in one layer 



======================================================================
PAGE 278 of 903
======================================================================
Concrete Pavement
Section 600
259
in an even manner without segregation, so that after compaction the total thickness is as 
specified. The paving machine shall have high amplitude tamping bars to give good initial 
compaction to the sub-base. One day before placing of the dry lean cement concrete sub-
base, the surface of the granular sub-base/drainage layer shall be given a fine spray of water 
and rolled with a smooth wheeled roller.
Preferably the lean concrete shall be placed and compacted across the full width of the 
two lane carriageway, by constructing it in one go. In roads with carriageway more than 
2 lanes a longitudinal joint shall be provided. Transverse butt type joint shall be provided at 
the end of the construction in a day. Transverse joints in the concrete pavement shall not be 
coterminous with the transverse construction joint of the Dry Lean Concrete.
The Dry Lean Concrete shall be laid in such a way that it is atleast 750 mm wider on each 
side than the proposed width including paved shoulders of the concrete pavement. The 
actual widening shall be decided based on the specifications of the paver, such that the 
crawler moves on the Dry Lean Concrete, and the cost of extra width shall be borne by the 
Contractor.
601.6.5	
Compaction
601.6.5.1	
The compaction shall be carried out immediately after the material is laid 
and levelled. In order to ensure thorough compaction, rolling shall be continued on the full 
width till there is no further visible movement under the roller and the surface is well closed. 
The minimum dry density obtained shall not be less than 98 percent of that achieved during 
the trial length construction in accordance with Clause 601.7. The densities achieved at the 
edges i.e. 0.5 m from the edge shall not be less than 96 percent of that achieved during the 
trial construction.
601.6.5.2	
The spreading, compacting and finishing of the lean concrete shall be carried 
out as rapidly as possible and the operation shall be so arranged as to ensure that the time 
between the mixing of the first batch of concrete in any transverse section of the layer and the 
final finishing of the same shall not exceed 90 minutes when the temperature of concrete is 
between 25ºC and 30ºC, and 120 minutes if less than 25ºC. This period may be reviewed by 
the Engineer in the light of the results of the trial run but in no case shall it exceed 120 minutes. 
Work shall not proceed when the temperature of the concrete exceeds 30ºC. If necessary, 
chilled water or addition of ice may be resorted to for bringing down the temperature. It is 
desirable to stop concreting when the ambient temperature is above 35°C. After compaction 
has been completed, roller shall not stand on the compacted surface for the duration of the 
curing period except during commencement of next day’s work near the location where work 
was terminated the previous day.
601.6.5.3	
Double drum smooth-wheeled vibratory rollers of minimum 80 to 100 kN

static weight are suitable for rolling dry lean concrete. In case any other roller is proposed, 
the same shall be got approved from the Engineer, after demonstrating its performance. The 
number of passes required to obtain maximum compaction depends on the thickness of the 
dry lean concrete, the compactibility of the mix and the weight and type of the roller and the 
same as well as the total requirement of rollers for the jobs shall be determined during trial 
run by measuring in-situ density and the scale of the work to be undertaken.
Except on super elevated portions where rolling shall proceed from the inner edge to the 
outer, rolling shall begin from the edges gradually progressing towards the centre. First, 
the edge/edges shall be compacted with a roller running forward and backward. The roller 
shall then move inward parallel to the centerline of the road, in successive passes uniformly 
lapping preceding tracks by at least one half width.
601.6.5.4	
A preliminary pass without vibration to bed the Dry Lean Concrete down 
shall be given followed by the required number of passes to achieve the desired density 
and, a final pass without vibration to remove roller with vibration marks and to smoothen the 
surface.
Special care and attention shall be exercised during compaction near joints, kerbs, channels, 
side forms and around gullies and manholes. In case adequate compaction is not achieved 
by the roller at these locations, use of plate vibrators shall be made, if so directed by the 
Engineer.
601.6.5.5	
The final lean concrete surface on completion of compaction shall be well 
closed, free from movement under roller and free from ridges, low spots, cracks, loose 
material, pot holes, ruts or other defects. The final surface shall be inspected immediately 
on completion and all loose, segregated or defective areas shall be corrected by using fresh 
lean concrete material, laid and compacted. For repairing honeycombed/hungry surface, 
concrete with aggregates of size 10 mm and below shall be spread and compacted as per 
Specifications. It is necessary to check the level of the rolled surface for compliance. Any 
level/thickness deficiency shall be corrected after applying concrete with aggregates of size 
10 mm and below after roughening the surface. Surface regularity also shall be checked with 
3 m straight edge. Strength tests shall be carried out, and if deficiency in strength is noticed, 
at least three (evenly spread) cores of minimum 100 mm dia per km shall be cut to check 
deficiency in strength. The holes resulting from cores shall be restored by filling with concrete 
of the specified strength and compacted by adequate rodding.
601.6.5.6	
Segregation of concrete in the tipping trucks shall be controlled by moving 
the dumper back and forth while discharging the mix into the same or by any appropriate 
means. Paving operation shall be such that the mix does not segregate.
601.6.6	
Joints
Construction and longitudinal joints shall be provided as per the drawings.



======================================================================
PAGE 280 of 903

Concrete Pavement
Section 600
261
Transverse butt type joint shall be provided at the end of the construction in a day. Longitudinal 
construction joint shall be provided only when full width paving is not possible. Transverse 
joints in Dry Lean concrete shall be staggered from the construction butt type joint in Concrete 
pavement by 800-1000 mm.
Longitudinal joint in Dry Lean Concrete shall be staggered by 300-400 mm from the 
longitudinal joint of concrete pavement.
At longitudinal or transverse construction joints, unless vertical forms are used, the edge of 
compacted material shall be cut back to a vertical plane where the correct thickness of the 
properly compacted material has been obtained.
601.6.7	
Curing
As soon as the lean concrete surface is compacted, curing shall commence. One of the 
following methods shall be adopted:
	
a)	
Curing may be done by covering the surface by gunny bags/hessian, 
which shall be kept wet continuously for 7 days by sprinkling water.
	
b)	
The curing shall be done by spraying with approved resin based 
aluminized reflective curing compound conforming to ASTM-C 309-81 
in accordance with Clause 602.9.12. As soon as the curing compound 
has lost its tackiness, the surface shall be covered with wet hessian for 
three days. The rate of application shall be as recommended by the 
supplier.
	
c)	
Wax-based white pigmented curing compound with water retention index 
of not less than 90 percent shall be used to cure the dry lean concrete. 
The curing compound shall conform to BS:7542. The compound shall 
be applied uniformly with a mechanical sprayer and with a hood to 
protect the spray from the wind. The curing compound shall be applied 
over the entire exposed surface of the Dry Lean Concrete, including 
sides and edges, at the rate of 0.2 litres/sq.m, or as recommended by 
the supplier.
	
	
The first application, referred to as curing application shall be applied 
immediately after the final rolling of Dry Lean Concrete is completed. 
As soon as the curing compound loses tackiness, the surface shall be 
covered with wet hessian for three days. The second application of 
curing compound also referred to as the debonding application, shall be 
applied 24 to 48 hours prior to the placement of the concrete pavement. 
Any damaged Dry Lean Concrete shall be corrected prior to the second 
application. Normally, the manufacturer’s instructions shall be followed 
for its application.

601.7	
Trial Mixes
The Contractor shall make trial mixes of dry lean concrete with moisture contents like 5.0, 
5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 percent using specified cement content, specified aggregate grading 
and aggregate-cement ratio specified in Clause 601.3.1. Optimum moisture and density 
shall be established by preparing cubes with varying moisture contents. Compaction of the 
mix shall be done in three layers with vibratory hammer fitted with a square or rectangular 
foot as described in Clause 903.5.1.1. After establishing the optimum moisture, a set of six 
cubes shall be cast at optimum moisture for the determination of compressive strength on the 
third and the seventh day. Trial mixes shall be repeated if the strength is not satisfactory by 
increasing cement content. After the mix design is approved, the Contractor shall construct a 
trial section in accordance with Clause 601.8.
If during the construction of the trial length, the optimum moisture content determined as 
above is found to be unsatisfactory, the Contractor may make suitable changes in the 
moisture content to achieve the satisfactory mix. The cube specimens prepared with the 
changed mix content should satisfy the strength requirement. Before production of the mix, 
natural moisture content of the aggregate should be determined on a day-to-day basis so 
that the moisture content could be adjusted. The mix finally designed should neither stick to 
the rollers nor become too dry resulting in ravelling of surface.
601.8	
Trial Length
601.8.1	
The trial length shall be constructed at least 14 days in advance of the 
proposed date of commencement of work. At least 30 days prior to the construction of the 
trial length, the Contractor shall submit for the Engineer’s approval a “Method Statement” 
giving detailed description of the proposed materials, plant, equipment, mix proportions, and 
procedure for batching, mixing, laying, compaction and other construction procedures. The 
Engineer shall also approve the location and length of trial construction which shall be a 
minimum of 100 m length laid in two days and for full width of the pavement. The trial length 
shall be outside the main works. The trial length shall contain the construction of at least one 
transverse construction joint involving hardened concrete and freshly laid Dry Lean Concrete 
sub-base. The construction of trial length shall be repeated till the Contractor proves his 
ability to satisfactorily construct the Dry Lean Concrete sub-base.
601.8.2	
After the construction of the trial length, the in-situ density of the freshly laid 
material shall be determined by sand replacement method. Three density holes shall be 
made at locations equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects the trial length and average of 
these densities shall be determined. The density holes shall not be made in the strip 500 mm 
from the edges. The average density obtained from the three samples collected shall be the 
reference density and is considered as 100 percent. The field density of regular work will be 
compared with this reference density in accordance with Clauses 601.6.5.1 and 903.5.1.2.

Storage of Materials
All materials shall be stored in accordance with the provisions of Clause 1014 of the 
Specifications. All efforts shall be made to store the materials in proper places so as to 
prevent their deterioration or contamination by foreign matter and to ensure their satisfactory 
quality and fitness for the work. The platform where aggregates are stock piled shall be 
paved and elevated from the ground atleast by 150 mm. The area shall have slope to drain 
off rain water. The storage space must also permit easy inspection, removal and storage of 
the materials. Aggregates of different sizes shall be stored in partitioned stack-yards. All such

materials even though stored in approved godowns must be subjected to acceptance test as 
per Clause 903 of these Specifications prior to their use.
602.3	
Proportioning of Concrete
602.3.1	
After approval by the Engineer of all the materials to be used in the concrete, 
the Contractor shall submit the mix design based on weighed proportions of all ingredients 
for the approval of the Engineer vide Clause 602.3.4. The mix design shall be submitted at 
least 30 days prior to the paving of trial length and the design shall be based on laboratory 
trial mixes using the approved materials and methods as per IRC:44 or IS:10262. The target 
mean strength for the design mix shall be determined as indicated in Clause 602.3.3.1. The 
mix design shall be based on the flexural strength of concrete.
602.3.2	
Cement Content
When Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is used the quantity of cement shall not be less than 
360 kg/cu.m. In case fly ash grade I (as per IS:3812) is blended at site as part replacement 
of cement, the quantity of fly ash shall be upto 20 percent by weight of cementitious material 
and the quantity of OPC in such a blend shall not be less than 310 kg/cu.m. The minimum of 
OPC content, in case ground granulated blast furnace slag cement blended, shall also not be 
less than 310 kg/m3. If this minimum cement content is not sufficient to produce concrete of 
the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary by the contractor at his own cost.
602.3.3	
Concrete Strength
602.3.3.1	
The characteristic flexural strength of concrete shall not be less than 4.5 MPa 
unless specified otherwise. Target mean flexural strength for mix design shall be more than 
4.5 MPa + 1.65s, where s is standard deviation of flexural strength derived by conducting 
test on minimum 30 beams. While designing the mix in the laboratory, correlation between 
flexural and compressive strengths of concrete shall be established on the basis of at least 
thirty tests on specimens. However, quality control in the field shall be exercised on the 
basis of flexural strength. It may, however, be ensured that the materials and mix proportions 
remain substantially unaltered during the daily concrete production. The water content shall 
be the minimum required to provide the agreed workability for full compaction of the concrete 
to the required density as determined by the trial mixes or as approved by the Engineer and 
the maximum free water cement ratio shall be 0.45 when only OPC is used and 0.50 when 
blended cement (Portland Pozzolana Cement or Portland Slag Cement or OPC blended with 
fly ash or Ground Granulated Blast Furnance Slag, at site) is used.
602.3.3.2	
The ratio between the 7 and 28 day strength shall be established for the mix 
to be used in the slab in advance, by testing pairs of beams and cubes at each stage on at 
least six batches of trial mix. The average strength of the 7 day cured specimens shall be 
divided by the average strength of the 28 day specimens for each batch, and the ratio “R’ 
shall be determined. The ratio ‘R’ shall be expressed to three decimal places.



======================================================================
PAGE 290 of 903
======================================================================
Concrete Pavement
Section 600
271
If during the construction of the trial length or during some normal working, the average 
value of any four consecutive 7 day test results falls below the required 7 day strength as 
derived from the value of ‘R’ then the cement content of the concrete shall, without extra 
payment, be increased by 5 percent by weight or by an amount agreed by the Engineer. 
The increased cement content shall be maintained at least until the four corresponding 
28 day strengths have been assessed for in conformity with the requirements as per 
Clause 602.3.3.1. Whenever the cement content is increased, the concrete mix shall be 
adjusted to maintain the required workability.
602.3.4	
Workability
602.3.4.1	
The workability of the concrete at the point of placing shall be adequate for 
the concrete to be fully compacted and finished without undue flow. The optimum workability 
for the mix to suit the paving plant being used shall be determined by the Contractor and 
approved by the Engineer. The control of workability in the field shall be exercised by the 
slump test as per IS:1199.
602.3.4.2	
The workability requirement at the batching and mixing plant and paving site 
shall be established by slump tests carried during trial paving. These requirements shall be 
established from season to season and also when the lead from batching and mixing plant 
site to the paving site changes. The workability shall be established for the type of paving 
equipment available. A slump value in the range of 25 ± 15 mm is reasonable for paving 
works but this may be modified depending upon the site requirement and got approved by 
the Engineer. These tests shall be carried out on every tipping truck/dumper at batching 
and mixing plant site and paving site initially when the work commences but subsequently 
the frequency can be reduced to alternate tipping trucks or as per the instructions of the 
Engineer.
602.3.5	
Design Mix
602.3.5.1	
The Contractor shall carry out laboratory trials of design mix with the 
materials from the approved sources to be used as per IRC:44. Trial mixes shall be made 
in presence of the Engineer or his representative and the design mix shall be subject to the 
approval of the Engineer. They shall be repeated, if necessary, until the proportions, that will 
produce a concrete which complies in all respects with these Specifications, and conform to 
the requirements of the design/drawings.
602.3.5.2	
The proportions determined as a result of the laboratory trial mixes may 
be adjusted, if necessary, during the construction of the trial length. Thereafter, neither the 
materials nor the mix proportions shall be varied in any way except with the written approval 
of the Engineer.

Section 600
Concrete Pavement
272
602.3.5.3	
Any change in the source of materials or mix proportions proposed by the 
Contractor during the course of work shall be assessed by making laboratory trial mixes and 
the construction of a further trial length of length not less than 50 m unless approval is given 
by the Engineer for minor adjustments like compensation for moisture content in aggregates 
or minor fluctuations in the grading of aggregate.
602.4	
Sub-base
The cement concrete pavement shall be laid over the sub-base constructed in accordance 
with the relevant drawings and Specifications. It shall be ensured that the sub-base is not 
damaged before laying the concrete pavement. If the dry lean concrete sub-base is found 
damaged at some places or it has cracks wider than 10 mm, it shall be repaired with fine 
cement concrete (aggregate size 10 mm and down) or bituminous concrete before laying 
separation membrane layer.
602.5	
Separation Membrane
A separation membrane shall be used between the concrete slab and the sub-base. Separation 
membrane shall be impermeable PVC sheet 125 micron thick transparent or white in colour 
laid flat with minimum creases. Before placing the separation membrane, the sub-base shall 
be swept clean of all the extraneous materials using air compressor. Wherever overlap of 
plastic sheets is necessary, the same shall be at least 300 mm and any damaged sheathing 
shall be replaced at the Contractor’s cost. The separation membrane may be nailed to the 
lower layer with concrete nails. The separation membrane shall be omitted when two layers 
of wax-based curing compound is used.
602.6	
Joints
602.6.1	
The locations and type of joints shall be as shown in the drawing. Joints 
shall be constructed depending upon their functional requirement. The location of the joints 
should be transferred accurately at the site and mechanical saw cutting of joints done as per 
stipulated dimensions. It shall be ensured that the required depth of cut is made from edge-
to-edge of the pavement. Transverse and longitudinal joints in the pavement and Dry Lean 
Concrete sub-base shall be staggered so that they are not coincident vertically and are at 
least 800 to 1000 mm and 300 to 400 mm apart respectively. Sawing of joints shall be carried 
out with diamond studded blades soon after the concrete has hardened to take the load of 
the sawing machine and crew members without damaging the texture of the pavement. 
Sawing operation could start as early as 4-8 hours after laying of concrete pavement but 
not later than 8 to 12 hours depending upon the ambient temperature, wind velocity, relative 
humidity and required maturity of concrete achieved for this purpose.
When the kerb is cast integrally with the main pavement slab, the joint cutting shall also be 
extended to the kerb.

extending upto a contraction joint, and if an interruption occurs, the concrete placed shall be 
removed upto the last preceding joint and disposed of. At all construction joints, steel bulk 
heads shall be used to retain the concrete. The surface of the concrete laid subsequently shall 
conform to the grade and cross sections of the previously laid pavement. When positioning of 
bulk head/stop-end is not possible, concreting to an additional 1 or 2 m length may be carried 
out to enable the movement of joint cutting machine so that joint grooves may be cut and the 
extra 1 or 2 m length is cut out and removed subsequently after concrete has hardened.
After minimum 14 days of curing, in case OPC cement is used and 16 days of curing when 
flyash or blended cement is used, the construction joint shall be widened to accommodate

Section 600
Concrete Pavement
282
transported to the paver site by means of tipping trucks or transit mixers of sufficient capacity 
and approved design in sufficient numbers to ensure a constant supply of concrete. Covers 
shall be used for protection of concrete against the weather. While loading the concrete 
truck shall be moved back and forth under the discharge chute to prevent segregation.  The 
tipping trucks shall be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete in a homogeneous state 
and discharging the same without segregation and loss of cement slurry. The feeding to the 
paver is to be regulated in such a way that the paving is done in an uninterrupted manner 
with a uniform speed throughout the day’s work. Tipping trucks shall be washed at a regular 
frequency as prescribed by the Engineer to ensure that no left-over mix of previous loading 
remains stuck.
602.9.4.2	
Placing of Concrete
The total time taken from the addition of the water to the mix, until the completion of the 
surface finishing and texturing shall not exceed 120 minutes when concrete temperature 
is less than 25ºC and 90 minutes when the concrete temperature is between 25ºC and 
30ºC. When the time between mixing and laying exceed these values, the concrete shall be 
rejected and removed from the site. Tipping trucks delivering concrete shall normally not run 
on plastic sheathing nor shall they run on completed slabs until after 28 days of placing the 
concrete.
The placing of concrete in front of the PQC paver should preferably be from the side placer 
to avoid damage to DLC by concrete tipping trucks. In case of unavoidable situation, truck 
supplying concrete to the paver may be allowed to ply on the DLC with the approval of the 
Engineer. The paver shall be capable of paving the carriageway as shown in the drawings, 
in a single pass and lift.
602.9.4.3	
Where fixed form pavers are to be used, forms shall be fixed in advance 
as per Clause 602.8. Before any paving is done, the site shall be shown to the Engineer, in 
order to verify the arrangement for paving besides placing of dowels, tie-bars etc., as per the 
relevant Clauses of these Specifications. The mixing and placing of concrete shall progress 
only at such a rate as to permit proper finishing, protecting and curing of the concrete in the 
pavement.
602.9.4.4	
In areas inaccessible to paving equipment, the pavement shall be constructed 
using side forms, as per Clause 602.9.7.
602.9.4.5	
In all cases, the temperature of the concrete shall be measured at the point 
of discharge from the delivery vehicle.
602.9.4.6	
The addition of water to the surface of the concrete to facilitate the finishing 
operations will not be permitted except with the approval of the Engineer when it shall be 
applied as a mist by means of approved equipment.

602.9.4.7	
If considered necessary by the Engineer, the paving machines shall be 
provided with approved covers to protect the surface of the slab under construction from 
direct sunlight and rain or hot wind.
602.9.4.8	
While the concrete is still plastic, its surface shall be textured by brush or 
tines as per the instructions of the engineer in compliance with Clause 602.9.11. The surface 
and edges of the slab shall be cured by the application of a sprayed liquid curing membrane in 
compliance with Clause 602.9.12. After the surface texturing, but before the curing compound 
is applied, the concrete slab shall be marked with the chainage at every 100 m interval by 
embossing.
602.9.4.9	
As soon as the side forms are removed, edges of the slabs shall be corrected 
wherever irregularities have occurred by using fine concrete composed of 1:1:2, cement 
: sand : coarse agg (10 mm down) with water cement ratio not more than 0.4 under the 
supervision of the Engineer.
602.9.4.10	
If the requirement of Clause 902.4. for surface regularity fails to be achieved 
on two consecutive working days, then normal working shall cease until the cause of the 
excessive irregularity has been identified and remedied.
602.9.5	
Construction by Slip Form Paver
602.9.5.1	
The slip form paving train shall consist of a power machine which spreads, 
compacts and finishes the concrete in a continuous operation. The slip form paving machine 
shall compact the concrete by internal vibration and shape it between the side forms with 
either a conforming plate or by vibrating and oscillating finishing beams. The concrete shall 
be deposited without segregation in front of slip form paver across the whole width and to a 
height which at all times is in excess of the required surcharge. The deposited concrete shall 
be struck off to the necessary average and differential surcharge by means of the strike off 
plate or a screw auger device extending across the whole width of the slab. The equipment 
for striking-off the concrete shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted for changes of the 
average and differential surcharge necessitated by change in slab thickness or crossfall.
602.9.5.2	
The level of the conforming plate and finishing beams shall be controlled 
automatically from the guide wires installed as per Clause 602.8 by sensors attached at the 
four corners of the slip form paving machine. The alignment of the paver shall be controlled 
automatically from the guide wire by at least one set of sensors attached to the paver. The 
alignment and level of ancillary machines for finishing, texturing and curing of the concrete 
shall be automatically controlled relative to the guide wire or to the surface and edge of the 
slab.
602.9.5.3	
Slip-form paving machines shall have vibrators of variable output, with a 



======================================================================
PAGE 303 of 903
======================================================================
Section 600
Concrete Pavement
284
maximum energy output of not less than 2.5 KW per metre width of slab per 300 mm depth 
of slab for a laying speed upto 1.5 m per minute. The machines shall be of sufficient mass 
to provide adequate reaction during spreading and paving operations on the traction units to 
maintain forward movements during the placing of concrete in all situations. Normal paving 
speed shall be maintained as per Clause 602.9.1.
602.9.5.4	
If the edges of the slip formed slab slump to the extent that the surface of 
the top edge of the slab does not comply with the requirements of Clause 902.3, the work 
shall be stopped until such time as the Contractor can demonstrate his ability to slip form 
the edges to the required levels. The deficient edge shall be temporarily supported by a side 
form and the thickness deficiency shall be made good by adding fresh concrete to the newly 
formed edge and compacting.
602.9.5.5	
Slip-form pavers with adequate width to pave the entire carriageway width 
in one go shall be employed unless specified in the Contract. In situations where full-width 
paving is not possible, paving in part widths may be permitted by the Engineer. Paving in part 
will be avoided, except in unavoidable circumstances. In case of part width paving, care shall 
be taken to ensure that while laying the next lane, bond between the remaining half length of 
tie bar or subsequently inserted tie bars and the newly laid concrete is adequately developed. 
Care shall be taken to avoid damage to the previous lane.
602.9.5.6	
In case paving in separate lanes is allowed, work on the adjacent lane shall 
be permitted when the previously paved lane is cured for at least 14 days and is in a position 
to bear the weight of paving machine. When the wheels or crawler tracks are to ply on the 
already paved surface, necessary precautions shall be taken by placing protective pads 
of rubber or similar material so that texture is not damaged. The wheel or track shall be 
reasonably away from the edge to avoid damage to the previously laid slab.
602.9.5.7	
Tube Floating
Upon the instructions of the Engineer, Contractor shall scrape the concrete surface when in 
plastic state with a 3 m long tube float fixed with a long and stable handle before texturing. 
Tube float shall be of an alloy steel tube of 50 to 60 mm diameter with a long and stable 
handle. The length of tube float shall preferably be longer than half the length of slab i.e., 
half the distance between two transverse contraction joints. This operation shall be done to 
minimise surface irregularity caused due to varied causes like frequent stoppages of work, 
surface deformation due to plastic flow etc. The tube float shall be placed at the centre of 
the slab parallel to longitudinal joint and pulled slowly and uniformly towards the edges. After 
the use of float tube, it shall be frequently cleaned before further use. The slurry removed 
shall be discarded. This activity shall be advanced laterally by providing an overlap of half 
the length of tube float. The removal of the cement slurry from the surface shall be sufficient 
enough such that the texture is formed on a firm surface and is more durable. This operation, 
however, shall be carried out after removing bleeding water.

which spread, compact and finish the concrete in a continuous operation.
602.9.6.2	
The concrete shall be discharged without segregation into a hopper spreader 
which is equipped with means for controlling its rate of deposition on to the sub-base. The 
spreader shall be operated to strike off concrete upto a level requiring a small amount of 
cutting down by the distributor of the spreader. The distributor of spreader shall strike off 
the concrete to the surcharge adequate to ensure that the vibratory compactor thoroughly 
compacts the layer. If necessary, poker vibrators shall be used adjacent to the side forms and 
edges of the previously constructed slab. The vibratory compactor shall be set to strike off the 
surface slightly high so that it is cut down to the required level by the oscillating beam. The 
machine shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted for changes in average and differential 
surcharge necessitated by changes in slab thickness or crossfall. The final finisher shall be 
able to finish the surface to the required level and smoothness as specified, care being taken 
to avoid bringing up of excessive mortar to the surface by over working.

10 mm dia bars at 150 mm spacing in both directions shall be provided at 50 mm below the 
top of the slab. The reinforcement shall be stopped 50 mm short of the contraction joint. Such 
reinforcement shall also be provided in the next slab panel on either side.
602.9.11	
Surface Texture
602.9.11.1	
Tining
After final floating and finishing of the slab and before application of the liquid curing 
membrane, the surface of concrete slabs shall be textured either in the transverse direction 
(i.e., at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the road) or in longitudinal direction (i.e., parallel 
to the centreline of the roadway). The texturing shall be done by tining the finished concrete 
surface by using rectangular steel tines. A beam or a bridge mounted with steel tines shall 
be equipped and operated with automatic sensing and control devices from main paver or 
auxiliary unit. The tining unit shall have facility for adjustment of the download pressure on 
the tines as necessary to produce the desired finish. The tining rakes shall be cleaned often 
to remove snots of slurry. The tines shall be inspected daily and all the damaged and bent 
tines shall be replaced before commencing texturing. Tined grooves shall be 3 mm wide and 
3 to 4 mm deep. Before commencing texturing, the bleeding water, if any, shall be removed 
and texturing shall be done on a firm surface. The measurement of texture depth shall be 
done as per Clause 602.12.
	
a)	
Transverse tining : When the texturing is specified in transverse 
direction, a beam of at least 3 m length mounted with tines shall be 
moved in transverse direction to produce the texture. The grooves 
produced shall be at random spacing of grooves but uniform in width 
and depth. The spacing shall conform to a pattern shown below:

602.9.11.2	
Brush Texturing
Alternatively on the instructions of the Engineer, the brush texturing shall be applied. The 
brushed surface texture shall be applied evenly across the slab in one direction by the use 
of a wire brush not less than 450 mm wide but wider brushes normally of 3 m length are 
preferred. The brush shall be made of 32 gauge tape wires grouped together in tufts placed 
at 10 mm centres. The tufts shall contain an average of 14 wires and initially be 100 mm long. 
The brush shall have two rows of tufts. The rows shall be 20 mm apart and the tufts in one 
row shall be opposite the centre of the gap between tufts in the other row. The brush shall be 
replaced when the shortest tuft wears down to 90 mm long.
The texture depth shall be determined by the Sand Patch Test as described in the 
Clause 602.12. This test shall be performed at least once for each day’s paving and wherever 
the Engineer considers it necessary at times after construction as under:
Five individual measurements of the texture depth shall be taken at least 2 m apart anywhere 
along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart along the pavement. 
No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edges of a concrete slab 
constructed in one pass.
Texture depths shall not be less than the minimum required depth when measurements are 
taken as given in Table 600-5 nor greater than an average of 1.25 mm.

After the application of the brushed texture, the surface of the slab shall have a uniform 
appearance.
Where the texture depth requirements are found to be deficient, the Contractor shall make 
good the texture across the full lane width over the length directed by the Engineer, by 
retexturing the hardened concrete surface in an approved manner.
602.9.12	
Curing
602.9.12.1	
Immediately after the surface texturing, the surface and sides of the slab shall 
be cured by the application of approved resin-based aluminized reflective curing compound 
which hardens into an impervious film or membrane with the help of mechanical sprayer.



======================================================================
PAGE 307 of 903
======================================================================
Section 600
Concrete Pavement
288
602.9.12.2	
The curing compound shall not react chemically with the concrete and the 
film or membrane shall not crack, peel or disintegrate within three weeks of application. 
Immediately prior to use, the curing compound shall be thoroughly agitated in its containers. 
The rate of spread shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions checked during 
the construction of the trial length and subsequently whenever required by the Engineer. The 
mechanical sprayer shall incorporate an efficient mechanical device for continuous agitation 
and mixing of the compound during spraying. The curing compound shall be sprayed in two 
applications to ensure uniform spread.
Curing compounds shall contain sufficient flake aluminum in finely divided dispersion to 
produce a complete coverage of the sprayed surface with a metallic finish. The compound 
shall become stable and impervious to evaporation of water from the surface of the concrete 
within 60 minutes of application and shall be of approved type. The curing compounds shall 
have a water retention efficiency index not less than 90 percent in accordance with BS 
Specification No. 7542 or as per ASTM C-309-81 Type 2.
602.9.12.3	
In addition to spraying of curing compound, the fresh concrete surface shall be 
protected for at least 3 hours by covering the finished concrete pavement with tents mounted 
on mobile trusses as described in Clause 602.7.2, during adverse weather conditions as 
directed by the Engineer. After three hours, the pavement shall be covered by moist hessian 
laid in two layers and the same shall then be kept damp for a minimum period of 14 days after 
which time the hessian may be removed. The hessian shall be kept continuously moist. All 
damaged/torn hessian shall be removed and replaced by new hessian on a regular basis.
602.9.12.4	
The Contractor shall be liable at his cost to replace any concrete damaged 
as a result of incomplete curing or cracked on a line other than that of a joint as per procedure 
in IRC:SP:83.
602.10	
Preparation and Sealing of Joint Grooves
602.10.1	
General
All joints shall be sealed using sealants described in Clause 602.2.10.
602.10.2	
Preparation of Joint Grooves for Sealing
602.10.2.1	
Grooves are saw cut in the first instance just to provide minimum width 
(3-5 mm) to facilitate development of crack at joint locations, as shown in the drawing.
Subsequently before sealing, grooves are widened by sawing as per the dimensions in the 
drawing. Dimension of the grooves shall be controlled by depth/width gauge.
602.10.2.2	
If rough arrises develop when grooves are made, they shall be ground to 
provide a chamfer approximately 5 mm wide. If the groove is at an angle upto 10º from the 
perpendicular to the surface, the overhanging edge of the groove shall be sawn or ground 
perpendicular. If spalling occurs or the angle of the former is greater than 10 degree, the 



======================================================================
PAGE 308 of 903
======================================================================
Concrete Pavement
Section 600
289
joint sealing groove shall be sawn wider and perpendicular to the surface to encompass 
the defects upto a maximum width, including any chamfer, of 20 mm for transverse joints 
and 10 mm for longitudinal joints. If the spalling cannot be so eliminated then the arises 
shall be repaired by an approved thin bonded arrises repair using cementitious/epoxy mortar 
materials.
602.10.2.3	
All grooves shall be cleaned of any dirt or loose material by air blasting with 
filtered, oil-free compressed air. The Engineer shall instruct cleaning by pressurized water 
jets. Depending upon the requirement of the sealant manufacturer, the sides of the grooves 
shall be sand blasted to increase the bondage between sealant and concrete.
602.10.2.4	
The groove shall be cleaned and dried at the time of priming and sealing. If 
sand blasting is recommended by the supplier, the same shall be carried out.
602.10.2.5	
Before sealing the temporary seal provided for blocking the ingress of dirt, 
soil etc., shall be removed. A highly compressible heat resistant paper-backed debonding 
strip as per drawing shall be inserted in the groove to serve the purpose of breaking the 
bond between sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug the joint groove so that the 
sealant may not leak through the cracks. The width of debonding strip shall be more than the 
joint groove width so that it is held tightly in the groove. In the case of longitudinal joints, heat 
resistant tapes may be inserted to block the leakage through bottom of the joint where hot 
poured sealant is used. When cold poured sealant is used a debonding tape of 1.0-2.0 mm 
thickness and 6 to 8 mm width shall be inserted to plug the groove so that the sealant does 
not enter in the initially cut groove.
602.10.3	
Sealing with Sealants
602.10.3.1	
When sealants are applied, an appropriate primer shall also be used if 
recommended by the manufacturer and it shall be applied in accordance with his instructions. 
The sealant shall be applied within the minimum and maximum drying times of the primer 
recommended by the manufacturer. Priming and sealing with applied sealants shall not be 
carried out when the naturally occurring temperature in the joint groove to be sealed, is below 
7ºC.
602.10.3.2	
If hot applied sealant is used it shall be heated and applied from a 
thermostatically controlled, indirectly heated preferably with oil jacketed melter and pourer 
having recirculating pump and extruder. For large road projects, sealant shall be applied with 
extruder having flexible hose and nozzle. The sealant shall not be heated to a temperature 
higher than the safe heating temperature and not for a period longer than the safe heating 
period, as specified by the manufacturer. The dispenser shall be cleaned out at the end of 
each day in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and reheated material 
shall not be used. The Movement Accomodation Factor of the sealant shall be more than 
10 percent.
602.10.3.3	
Cold applied sealants with chemical formulation like polysulphide/ 
polyurethene/ silicone as per IRC:57 shall be used These shall be mixed and applied within 



======================================================================
PAGE 309 of 903
======================================================================
Section 600
Concrete Pavement
290
the time limit specified by the manufacturer. If primers are recommended they shall be applied 
neatly with an appropriate brush. The Movement Accomodation Factor shall be more than 
25 percent.
602.10.3.4	
The sealants applied at contraction phase of the slabs would result in bulging 
of the sealant over and above the slab. Therefore, the Contractor in consultation with the 
Engineer, shall establish the right temperature and time for applying the sealant. Thermometer 
shall be hung on a pole at the site for facilitating control during the sealing operation.
602.10.3.5	
Sealant shall be applied, slightly to a lower level than the slab with a tolerance 
of 3 ± 1 mm.
602.10.3.6	
During sealing operation, it shall be seen that no air bubbles are introduced 
in the sealant either by vapours or by the sealing process. The sealant after pouring, shall be 
allowed to cure for 7 days or for a period as per instructions of manufacturers.
602.11	
Trial Length
602.11.1	
The trial shall be constructed at least one month in advance of the proposed 
start of concrete paving work. At least one month prior to the construction of the trial length, 
the Contractor shall submit for the Engineer’s approval a detailed method statement giving 
description of the proposed materials, plant, equipment and construction methods. All the 
major equipments like paving train, batching plant, tipping trucks etc., proposed in the 
construction are to be approved by the Engineer before their procurement. No trials of new 
materials, plant, equipment or construction methods, nor any development of them shall be 
permitted either during the construction of trial length or in any subsequent paving work, 
unless they form part of further trials. The trial lengths shall be constructed away from the 
carriageway.
602.11.2	
The Contractor shall demonstrate the materials, plant, equipment and 
methods of construction that are proposed for concrete paving, by first constructing a trial 
length of slab, at least 100 m long for mechanised construction and at least 50 m long for hand 
guided methods. The width of the trial section shall be the full carriageway width as shown 
in the drawings. If the first trial is unsatisfactory, the Contractor shall have to demonstrate his 
capability to satisfactorily construct the pavement in subsequent trials.
602.11.3	
The trial length shall be constructed in two parts over a period comprising at 
least part of two separate working days, with a minimum of 50 m constructed each day for 
mechanised construction and a minimum of 25 m on each day for hand guided construction. 
The trial length shall be constructed at a paving rate which is proposed for the main work.
602.11.4	
Transverse joints including expansion joint and longitudinal joint that are 
proposed in the main work shall be constructed and assessed in the trial length.
602.11.5	
The trial length shall comply with the Specifications in all respects including 
the test requirement of Table 900-6 with the following additions.

Concrete Pavement
Section 600
291
602.11.5.1	
Surface Levels and Regularity
	
a)	
In checking for compliance with Clause 902.3 the levels shall be taken 
at intervals at the locations specified in this Clause along any line or 
lines parallel to the longitudinal centre line of the trial length.
	
b)	
The maximum number of permitted irregularities of pavement surface 
shall comply with the requirements of Clause 902.4. Shorter trial lengths 
shall be assessed pro-rata based on values for a 300 m length.
602.11.5.2	
Joints
	
a)	
Alignment of dowel bars shall be inspected in any two consecutive 
transverse joints in a trial length construction by removing the fresh 
concrete in a width of 0.5 m on either side of the joint. The joint pit shall 
be refilled with freshly prepared concrete, after inspection. Alternatively, 
it can be tested by suitable device like MIT SCAN with the permission 
of the Engineer. If the position or alignment of the dowel bars at one 
of these joints does not comply with the requirements and if that joint 
remains the only one that does not comply after the next 3 consecutive 
joints of the same type have been inspected, then the method of placing 
dowels shall be deemed to be satisfactory. In order to check sufficient 
joints for dowel bar alignment without extending the trial length unduly 
joints may be constructed at more frequent joint intervals than the 
normal spacing required in trial slabs.
	
b)	
If there are deficiencies in the first expansion joint that is constructed 
as a trial, the next expansion joint shall be a trial joint. Should this also 
be deficient, further trial of expansion joints shall be made as part of 
the trial length which shall not form part of the permanent works, unless 
agreed by the Engineer.
602.11.5.3	
Density
In-situ density in trial length shall be assessed as described in Clause 903.5.2.2 from at least 
3 cores drilled from each part of the trial length when the concrete is not less than 7 days 
old. Should any of the cores show honey-combing in the concrete, the trail length shall be 
rejected and the construction in the main carriageway shall not be permitted until further trials 
have shown that modification has been made which would result in adequate compaction.
602.11.5.4	
Strength
Minimum of thirty (30) beams for flexural strength and thirty (30) cubes for compressive 
strength shall be prepared from the concrete delivered in front of the paving plant. Each pair 
of beams and cubes shall be from the same location/batch but different sets of beams and 
cubes shall be from different locations/batches. Compressive and flexural strength shall be 
tested after 28 days water curing in the laboratory.

Section 600
Concrete Pavement
292
At the age of 28 days, thirty (30) cores with diameter 150 mm shall be cut from the pavement 
slab when the thickness of concrete pavement  is more than 300 mm. In case the concrete 
pavement thickness is less than 300 mm, the dia of core shall be 100 mm. The cores shall 
be suitably cut at both ends to provide a specimen of plain surface on both ends. The dia 
to height ratio of core shall be 1 to 2. For cylindrical specimen of PQC of dia 150 mm, the 
variation in dia shall be ± 0.5 mm, a tolerance on height shall be ± 1 mm for a specimen of 
height 300 mm or more. For cylindrical specimen of dia 100 mm, the variation in dia shall be 
± 0.3 mm, and a tolerance on height shall be ±1 mm for a specimen height of 200 mm. The 
compressive strength test shall be conducted as per IS:516.
Concrete in the member represented by a core test shall be considered acceptable, if the 
average equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the cube 
strength (characteristic strength) of the grade of the concrete specified for the corresponding 
age of 28 days and no individual core has a strength less than 75 percent.
202.11.6	
Approval and Acceptance
602.11.6.1	
Approval of the materials, plant, equipment and construction methods shall 
be given when the trial length complies with the Specifications. The Contractor shall not 
proceed with normal working until the trial length has been approved.  If the Engineer does not 
notify the Contractor of any deficiencies in any trial length within 7 days after the completion 
of that trial length, the Contractor may assume that the trial length, and the materials, plant, 
equipment and construction methods adopted are acceptable, provided that the 28 days 
strength of cubes and cores extracted from trial length meet the requirement of the Specified 
strength.
602.11.6.2	
When approval has been given, the materials, plant, equipment and 
construction methods shall not thereafter be changed, except for normal adjustments and 
maintenance of plant, without the approval of the Engineer. Any changes in materials, plant, 
equipment, and construction methods shall entitle the Engineer to require the Contractor to 
lay a further trial length as described in this Clause to demonstrate that the changes will not 
adversely affect the permanent works.
602.11.6.3	
Trial lengths which do not comply with the Specifications, with the exception 
of areas which are deficient only in surface texture and which can be remedied in accordance 
with Clause 602.9.11.6 shall be removed immediately upon notification of deficiencies by the 
Engineer and the Contractor shall construct a further trial length.
602.11.7	
Inspection of Dowel Bars
602.11.7.1	
Compliance with Clause 602.6.5. for the position and alignment of dowel 
bars at contraction and expansion joints shall be checked by measurements relative to the 
side forms or guide wires.
602.11.7.2	
When the slab has been constructed, the position and alignment of dowel 
bars and any filler board shall be measured after carefully exposing them in the plastic 



======================================================================
PAGE 312 of 903
======================================================================
Concrete Pavement
Section 600
293
concrete across the whole width of the slab. When the joint is an expansion joint, the top of 
the filler board shall be exposed sufficiently in the plastic concrete to permit measurement 
of any lateral or vertical displacement of the board. During the course of normal working, 
these measurements shall be carried out in the pavement section at the end of days work 
by extending slab length by 2 m. After sawing the transverse joint groove, the extended 2 m 
slab shall be removed carefully soon after concrete has set to expose dowels over half the 
length. These dowels can be tested for tolerances. This joint shall be treated as construction 
joint. The position of dowel bars in any type of transverse joint ie, contraction, construction or 
expansion can alternatively be tested by suitable device like MIT SCAN with the permission 
of the Engineer.
602.11.7.3	
If the position and alignment of the bars in a single joint in the slab is 
unsatisfactory then the next two joints shall be inspected. If only one joint of the three is 
defective, the rate of checking shall be increased to one joint per day until the Engineer is 
satisfied that compliance is being achieved.
602.11.7.4	
After the dowel bars have been examined, the remainder of the concrete 
shall be removed over a width of 500 mm on each side of the line of the joint and reinstated 
to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The dowels shall be inserted on both sides of the 1 m wide 
slab by drilling holes and grouting with epoxy mortar. Plastic sheath as per Clause 602.6.5.5 
shall be provided on dowels on one of the joints. The joint groove shall be widened and 
sealed as per Clause 602.10.
602.11.8	
Inspection of Tie Bars
To check the position of the tie bars, one metre length 0.5 m on either side of the longitudinal 
joint shall be opened when the concrete is green (within 20 to 30 minutes of its laying). The 
pit shall be refilled with the fresh concrete of same mix after checking.
602.12	
Measurement of Texture Depth – Sand Patch Method
602.12.1	
The following Apparatus shall be used:
	
i)	
A cylindrical container of 25 ml internal capacity;
	
ii)	
A flat wooden disc 64 mm diameter with a hard rubber disc, 1.5 mm 
thick, next to one face, the reverse face being provided with a handle;
	
iii)	
Dry natural sand with a rounded particle shape passing a 300 micron 
IS sieve and retained on a 150 micron IS sieve.
602.12.2	
Method
The surface to be measured shall be dried, any extraneous mortar and loose material 
removed and the surface swept clean using a wire brush both at right angles and parallel to 
the carriageway. The cylindrical container shall be filled with the sand, tapping the base 3 
times on the surface to ensure compaction, and striking off the sand level with the top of the 
cylinder. The sand shall be poured into a heap on the surface to be treated. The sand shall

Test  Section
A unit of testing shall be 75 m per lane. If the length of construction is less than 75 m it shall 
be taken as one unit.
602.12.4.3	
Test  Procedure
In each 75 m section, along the diagonal line, 10 points shall be selected for making checks 
of depth, width and spacing of tine grooves. The surface where tests are to be conducted 
shall be cleared carefully with a wire brush or a steel straight edge or using a corborundum 
plate to remove any upward projection of concrete. When the base plate of the gauge is in 
contact with the concrete surface, the gauge shall be pressed to the bottom of groove and 
the depth shall be measured and recorded at this location. At the same location, the spacing 
of tines shall be measured to verify whether the pattern recommended in Clause 602.9.11.1 
is complied or not.
The average of depth and width at 10 locations shall be calculated and recorded to the nearest 
1 mm. The spacing of spectrum measured at 10 locations shall be recorded separately.
602.12.5	
The average depth shall be 3 to 4 mm. When the depth is less than 
2.5 mm and in excess of 4.5 mm, the Contractor shall stop concreting till he corrects his tine

GEOSYNTHETICS  FOR  ROAD  AND  BRIDGE  WORKS
701.1	
Application and General Requirements
The specification covers the various applications of geosynthetic materials for use in road 
and bridge works including supplying and laying as per contract specifications.
Geosynthetic is a general classification for all synthetic materials used in geotechnical 
engineering application. It includes geotextiles, geogrids, geostrips, geomembranes, geonets, 
geocomposites, geocells, geosynthetic mats, paving fabric and glass grid etc. Geo fabrics 
made from natural fibres such as jute, and coir referred to herein under natural geotextiles 
may also be used in different geotechnical engineering applications.
	
i)	
Geotextiles : Any permeable synthetic textile used with foundation, 
soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-related material 
as an integral part of a human-made project, structure, or system.
	
	
The geotextile fabric shall be a woven, non-woven or knitted fabric 
consisting of long-chain polymeric filaments or yarns such as 
polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester or any combination thereof, 
formed into a stable network such that the filaments or yarns retain 
their relative position to each other.
	
	
There are several application areas for geotextiles requiring specific 
functions namely separation, filtration, drainage, reinforcement or a 
combination thereof.
	
ii)	
Geogrids : A deformed or non-deformed netlike polymeric material used 
with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or any other geotechnical engineering-
related material as an integral part of human-made project, structure, 
or system.
	
	
Geogrids have relatively high strength, high modulus, and low-creep-
sensitive polymers with apertures varying from 10 to 100 mm in size or 
more. The openings/holes in geogrids are either elongated ellipse, near 
squares with rounded corners, squares or rectangles. Geogrids can be 
of uni-axial grid, bi-axial grid or three dimensional grids. Geostrip is 
another form of geogrid, which is used in reinforced soil structures. It 
is primarily made of synthetic material in strips and is made from high 
tenacity polyester yarn and contained in a suitable polymer sheath.
	
	
These are used as reinforcement in pavements and reinforced soil 
slopes.
	
iii)	
Geomembranes : An essentially impermeable membrane (liner 
or barrier) used with foundation, soil, rock, earth, or in any other 
geotechnical application as an integral part of human-made project, 
structure, or system, used to control fluid migration.



======================================================================
PAGE 319 of 903
======================================================================
Section 700
Geosynthetics
300
	
	
Geomembranes are made from PVC or polyethylene sheets, which 
are duly protected from ultraviolet exposure by carbon black or any 
antioxidants and thermal stabilizers.
	
	
These are used as capillary cut off in roads in water logged areas.
	
iv)	
Geonets : Geonets are used in combination with other types of 
geosynthetics. These are usually formed by continuous polymeric ribs 
at acute angle to one another. When the ribs are opened relatively 
large size apertures are formed in a net like configuration.
	
	
These are used in combination with other geosynthetic materials to 
form a composite material.
	
v)	
Geocomposite : A manufactured material, which could be a 
combination of any two or more synthetic materials like geotextiles, 
geogrids, geonets and geomembranes etc., in laminated or composite 
form. One of the popular form of geocomposite is Drainage Composite. 
Drainage Composites are formed by combining geotextile or 
geomembrane with a core of geonet or seratted/corrugated polymeric 
materials.
	
	
Prefabricated Vertical Drains (PVD)/Band Drains and Fin Drains come 
under the category of geocomposites.
	
vi)	
Geocell : It is a three dimensional structure with interconnected 
cells. The geocells are made of polyester/polypropylene/high density 
polyethylene stabilized with carbon black.
	
	
Geocells may be used in erosion control of slopes.
	
vii)	
Geosynthetic Mats : These are two dimensional or three dimensional 
mats with specified thickness, made of multi-filaments, with apertures to 
allow vegetation growth for erosion control application. Geosynthetic mat 
consists of UV stabilized non-degradable polypropylene/polyethylene 
or similar polymer fibres that are extruded or heat bonded to provide a 
dimensionally stable matrix. A tension element like steel wire mesh or 
geogrid shall be included in these mats as reinforcement, where these 
mats are required to posses more strength against erosive forces, like 
in steep slopes or in heavy rainfall areas.
	
	
These are used for erosion protection of slopes.
	
viii)	 Natural Geotextiles : These geotextiles are made of natural fibres 
like jute or coir. The blankets/mats/mesh made of these fibres are 
sometimes further reinforced with polymeric nettings to enhance its 
tensile strength and for holding the fibres intact. The polymer netting 
is securely stitched on both sides of the fabric to form a strong quilted 
mat. These fabrics have excellent drapability and aid in quick growth of 
vegetation and are used for erosion control applications.

Section 700
301
	
ix)	
Paving Fabric and Glass Grids : The paving fabrics are non woven 
heat set material, consisting of atleast 85% by weight of polyolefins, 
polyester or polyamides. They are heat bonded only on one side.
	
	
Glass grids are either a composite glass fibre reinforced geogrid with 
continuous filament nonwoven geotextile chemically /mechanically 
bonded to the grid, or bituminous coated glass fibre geogrids with or 
without adhesive on one side of the grid.
	
	
The paving fabric, glass grids and composite of fabric and glass grids 
are used in bituminous pavements to act as stress relieving membrane 
and crack retarding layer within the pavement structure. The paving 
fabric also serves the function of water barrier.

Construction
702.3.1	
General
Exposure of geotextiles to the elements between lay down and cover shall be a maximum of 
14 days to minimize damage potential.
In trenches, after placing the backfill material, the geotextile shall be folded over the top 
of the filter material to produce a minimum overlap of 300 mm for trenches greater than 
300 mm wide. In trenches less than 300 mm wide, the overlap shall be equal to the width of 
the trench. The geotextile shall then be covered with the subsequent course.
Overlap at roll ends and at adjacent sheets shall be a minimum of 450 mm, except when 
placed under water. In such instances, the overlap shall be a minimum of 1 m. Where seams 
are required in the longitudinal trench direction, they shall be joined by either sewing or 
overlapping. All seams and overlaps shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
Care shall be taken during installation so as to avoid any damage to the geotextile. Damages, 
if any, during installation shall be repaired by placing a geotextile patch over the damaged 
area and extending it 1m beyond the perimeter of the tear or damage, or as approved by the 
Engineer.
702.3.2	
Subsurface Drainage
Construction shall conform to Clause 309.3 of the specifications.
702.3.3	
Separation
After preparation of subgrade as per the specifications along the road alignment, geotextile 
shall be rolled out as indicated in the drawings. The entire roll shall be placed on the subgrade

and unrolled as smoothly as possible. Wrinkles and folds in the fabric shall be removed by 
stretching as required.
Adjacent rolls of geotextiles shall be overlapped, sewn, or joined as required. For curves, the 
geotextile shall be folded or cut and overlapped in the direction of construction. Folds in the 
geotextile shall be stapled or pinned approximately 0.6 m centre-to-centre. Before covering, 
the condition of the geotextile shall be checked for damage (i.e., holes, nips, tears, etc) by 
the Engineer.
Before placing the first lift of granular sub-base on the geotextile, a trial stretch of 100 m 
shall be laid as per roll width to establish a proper construction methodology of placing and 
compacting the sub-base in a manner that no damages are caused to the separation layer 
of geotextile.
702.3.4	
Filter Layer Under Stone Pitching for Erosion Control
The geotextile shall be placed in intimate contact of soil ensuring slight tension, to avoid 
wrinkles or folds and shall be anchored on a properly shaped surface as indicated in drawings 
and approved by the Engineer. It shall be ensured that the placement of the overlying material 
be placed in such a manner that it does not tear/puncture the geotextile. Anchoring of the 
terminal ends of the geotextile shall be accomplished as per drawings through the use of key 
trenches or aprons at the crest and toe of slope.
The geotextile shall be placed with the machine direction parallel to the direction of water 
flow. Adjacent geotextile sheets shall be joined by either sewing or overlapping.
The pitching shall begin at the toe and proceed up the slope. Big sized boulders shall not be 
allowed to roll down the slope.
Any geotextile damaged shall be either replaced or repaired with a patch, as directed by the 
Engineer, at the cost of the contractor.
702.4	
Measurement for Payment
The measurement for payment for sub surface drains shall be as per Clause 309.
The geotextile for separation and for filter layer shall be measured in square metres as 
per planned dimensions with no allowance for overlapping at transverse and longitudinal 
joints. Excavation, back fill, bedding and cover material shall be measured separately as per 
relevant clauses of the Contract.
702.5	
Rate
The contract unit rate for subsurface drains using geotextile shall be as per Clause 309.5.

approved by the Engineer. Potholes and locally failed and cracked pavement sections shall 
be repaired as directed by the Engineer. If the existing pavement is rough or has been milled, 
a levelling course shall be provided prior to installation of the Glass grid.
708.3.3	
Tack Coat
The tack coat used to impregnate the fabric and bond the fabric to the pavement shall be 
paving grade Bitumen of VG-10. Glass fiber grids with adhesive on one side may not require 
a tack coat.
The tack coat shall be applied using a calibrated distributor spray bar. Hand spraying, 
squeegee and brush application may be used only in locations where the distributor truck 
cannot reach. The tack coat shall be uniformly applied at a rate to bond the nonwoven scrim 
to the existing pavement surface. The tack coat application rate shall be 1 Kg per square 
metre or as specified in the contract. When using emulsions, the application rate must be 
increased as directed by the Engineer to take into account the water content in the emulsion. 
The temperature of the tack coat shall be sufficiently high to permit a uniform spray. Bitumen 
shall be sprayed at temperatures between 143°C and 163°C. For emulsions, the distributor 
tank temperatures shall be maintained between 55°C and 71°C. The target width of the tack 
coat application shall be equal to the Glass grid width plus 100-150 mm. The tack coat shall 
be applied only as far in advance of Glass grid installation as is appropriate to ensure a tacky 
surface at the time of Glass grid placement. Traffic shall not be allowed on the tack coat. 
Excess tack coat shall be cleaned from the pavement.
708.3.4	
Paving Fabric Placement
The paving fabric shall be placed onto the tack coat using mechanical or manual lay down 
equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum amount of wrinkling or 
folding. The paving fabric shall be placed before to the tack coat cools and loses tackiness. 
After laying the paving fabric, some loose bituminous premix material shall be sprinkled 
on it in the wheel path of the paver and the tipper to ensure that the fabric is not picked up 
between the wheels. Paving fabric shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay 
tapers to a thickness of less than 40 mm. Excess paving fabric which extends beyond the 
edge of existing pavement or areas of tack coat application shall be trimmed and removed. 
When bitumen emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to cure properly such that 
no water/moisture remains prior to placing the paving fabric. Wrinkles or folds in excess 
of 25 mm shall be single-lapped in the direction of the paving operation. Brooming and/
or pneumatic rolling will be required to maximize paving fabric contact with the pavement 
surface. Additional hand-placed tack coat may be required at laps and repairs as determined 
by the Engineer to satisfy bitumen retention of the lapped paving fabric. All areas where 
paving fabrics have been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except necessary 
construction equipment will be allowed to drive on the paving fabric. Turning of the paver 
and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum to avoid movement and

damage to the paving fabric. Abrupt starts and stops shall also be avoided. Damaged fabric 
shall be removed and replaced with the same type of fabric. Overlaps shall be shingle-
lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be placed between the overlap to 
satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be sufficient to ensure full closure 
of the joint but not exceed 150 mm. Transverse joints shall be overlapped in the direction 
of the pavement by 100 to 150 mm or as per the manufacturer’s recommendations or as 
directed by the Engineer. Longitudinal joints shall be overlapped by 20-30 mm or as per the 
manufacturer’s recommendations or as directed by the engineer. The overlay operations 
shall be completed at the earliest after laying the fabric.
708.3.5	
Glass Grid Placement
The glass grid shall be placed on the surface provided by the tack coat using mechanical 
or manual lay down equipment capable of providing a smooth installation with a minimum 
amount of wrinkling or folding. On curves, the Glass grid must be cut and realigned to match 
the curvature.
Glass grid shall not be installed in areas where the bituminous overlay tapers to a compacted 
thickness of less than 40 mm. When emulsions are used, the emulsion shall be allowed to 
cure properly such that no water/moisture remains prior to placing the glass grid. Wrinkles 
severe enough to cause folds shall be slit and laid flat. Brooming and/or rubber-tire rolling will 
be required to maximize glass grid contact with the pavement surface. Additional hand-placed 
tack coat may be required at overlaps and repairs as required by the Engineer. Turning and 
braking of the paver and other vehicles shall be done gradually and kept to a minimum to 
avoid movement and damage to the glass grid. Damaged composite shall be removed and 
replaced with the same type of composite and a tack coat.
All areas where glass grid has been placed shall be paved the same day. No traffic except 
necessary construction traffic shall be allowed to drive on the glass grid.
Overlaps shall be shingle - lapped in the direction of paving. Additional tack coat shall be 
placed between the overlap to satisfy saturation requirements of the fabric. Overlap shall be 
sufficient to ensure full closure of the joint but not exceeding 150 mm.
708.3.6	
Overlay Placement
Bituminous overlay construction shall closely follow the placement of paving fabric or glass-
grid. Excess tack coat that bleeds through the paving fabric or glass grid shall be removed by 
broadcasting hot mix or sand on the glass grid. Excess sand or hot mix shall be removed before 
beginning the paving operation. In the event of rainfall prior to the placement of the asphalt 
overlay, the fabric must be allowed to dry completely before the overlay is placed. Overlay 
asphalt thickness shall meet the requirements of the contract drawings and documents. The 
minimum compacted thickness of the first lift of overlay asphalt concrete shall not be less 
than 40 mm.

Type I or Type II barricades shall be used in situations where traffic is 
maintained through the temporary traffic control zone. They may be used singly or in groups 
to mark a specific condition, or they may be used in a series for channelizing traffic. Type 
I barricades normally would be used on conventional roads or urban streets and arterials. 
Type II barricades have more retro-reflective area and are intended for use on highways and 
expressways or other high-speed roadways.
813.6.3.2	
Type III barricades be used for road closure and may extend completely 
across a roadway or from kerb to kerb. Where provision is made for access of authorized 
equipment and vehicles, the responsibility should be assigned to a person to ensure proper 
closure at the end of each work day.
When a highway is legally closed but access must still be allowed for local traffic, the Type III 
barricade should not be extended completely across a roadway. A sign with the appropriate 
legend concerning permissible use by local traffic shall be mounted.
Signs may be erected on barricades, particularly those of the fixed type, that offer a most 
advantageous facility for this purpose. The ROAD CLOSED and DETOUR or ARROW signs, 
and the large arrow warning signs, for example, can be mounted effectively on or above the 
barricade that closes the roadway.

814.2.1	
The system shall consist of a group or series of free standing plastic barrels 
configured in increasing weights from the impact point towards the object. The array shall be 
designed to transfer the vehicle’s momentum to the increasing masses of sand in the barrels 
and to provide a gradual deceleration. Each barrel is to be designed with a specific weight of 
unbagged sand to absorb the energy of an errant vehicle. The lighter barrels shall be placed 
near the front of arrays to gradually slow the smaller vehicles. Heavier barrels shall be placed 
further back in the array to slow the larger vehicles. The standard module weights are 90 kg, 
180 kg, 315 kg, 640 kg and 950 kg, as recommended by AASHTO. The axis of symmetry of 
the arrays should be directed along the most likely direction. Approach for an arrant vehicle 
for gore areas could be back towards the inter-section of the edges of pavement. Obstacles 
in narrow median should be shielded on both ends and the modules placed on the ends 
(to shield opposite direction traffic) should be placed flushed with down stream edge of the 
obstacle to avoid wrong way hits. The modules should be placed on a concrete or asphalt 
surface with maximum slope of 5 percent in any direction. Each barrel’s location and weight

Rectification
Where the surface regularity of subgrade and the various pavement courses fall outside the 
specified tolerances in Clause 902.4, the Contractor shall be liable to rectify these in the 
manner described below and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
	
i)	
Subgrade: Where the surface is high, it shall be trimmed and suitably 
compacted.  Where the same is low, the deficiency shall be corrected by 
scarifying the lower layer and adding fresh material and recompacting 
to the required density.  The degree of compaction and the type of 
material to be used shall conform to the requirements of Clause 305.



======================================================================
PAGE 439 of 903
======================================================================
Section 900
Quality Control for Road Works
420
	
ii)	
Granular Sub-base: Same as at (i) above, except that the degree of 
compaction and the type of material to be used shall conform to the 
requirements of Clause 401.
	
iii)	
Lime/Cement Stabilized Soil Sub-base: For lime/cement treated 
materials where the surface is high, the same shall be suitably trimmed 
while taking care that the material below is not disturbed due to this 
operation.  However, where the surface is low, the same shall be 
corrected as described herein below.
	
	
For cement treated material, when the time elapsed between detection 
of irregularity and the time of mixing of the material is less than 2 hours, 
the surface shall be scarified to a depth of 50 mm, supplemented with 
freshly mixed materials as necessary and recompacted as per the 
relevant specification.  When this time is more than 2 hours, the full 
depth of the layer shall be removed from the pavement and replaced 
with fresh material to Specification.  This shall also apply to lime treated 
material except that the time criterion shall be 3 hours instead of 2 
hours.
	
iv)	
Water Bound Macadam/Wet Mix Macadam Sub-base/Base: Where 
the surface is high or low, the top 75 mm shall be scarified, reshaped 
with added material as necessary and recompacted as per Clause 404 
in the case of Water Bound Macadam and to Clause 406 in the case of 
Wet Mix Macadam.
	
v)	
Bituminous Constructions: For bituminous construction other than 
wearing course, where the surface is low, the deficiency shall be 
corrected by adding fresh material over a suitable tack coat, if needed, 
and recompacting as per specifications.  Where the surface is high, 
the extra thickness in the affected layer shall be removed and replaced 
with fresh material and compacted to Specifications.
	
	
For wearing course, where the surface is high or low, the full depth of the 
layer shall be removed and replaced with fresh material and compacted 
to specifications.  In all cases where the removal and replacement of a 
bituminous layer is involved, the area treated shall not be less than 5 m 
in length and not less than 3.5 m in width.
	
vi)	
Dry Lean Concrete Sub-Base: The defective length of the course 
shall be removed to full depth and replaced with material conforming to 
Clause 601.  The area treated shall be at least 3 m long, not less than 
1 lane width and extend to the full depth.  Before relaying the course, 
the disturbed subgrade or layer below shall be corrected by levelling, 
watering and compacting.

Section 900
421
	
vii)	
Cement Concrete Pavement: The defective areas having irregularity 
exceeding 3 mm but not greater than 6 mm when tested with a 
3 metre long straight edge may be rectified by scrabbling or grinding 
using approved equipment.  When required by the Engineer, areas 
which have been reduced in level by the above operation(s) shall 
be retextured in an approved manner either by cutting grooves 
(5 mm deep) or roughening the surface by hacking the surface.  If high 
areas in excess 6 mm or low areas in excess of 3 mm occur, exceeding 
the permitted numbers and if the Contractor cannot rectify, the slab 
shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor’s expense 
and in no case the area removed shall be less than the full width of the 
lane in which the irregularity occurs and full length of the slab.
If deemed necessary by the Engineer, any section of the slab which deviates from the specified 
levels and tolerances shall be demolished and reconstructed at the Contractor’s cost.
902.6	
Riding Quality
The riding quality of bituminous concrete wearing surface, as measured by a standard towed 
fifth wheel bump integrator, shall not be more than 2000 mm per Km.
903	
QUALITY  CONTROL  TESTS  DURING  CONSTRUCTION
903.1	
General
The materials supplied and the works carried out by the Contractor shall conform to the 
specifications prescribed in the Clauses for the relevant items of work.
For ensuring the requisite quality of construction, the materials and works shall be subjected 
to quality control tests, as described hereinafter.  The testing frequencies set forth are the 
desirable minimum and the Engineer shall have the full authority to carry out additional tests 
as frequently as he may deem necessary, to satisfy himself that the materials and works 
comply with the appropriate specifications. However, the number of tests recommended in 
Tables 900-3 and 900-4 may be reduced at the discretion of the Engineer if it is felt that 
consistency in the quality of materials can still be maintained with the reduced number of 
tests.
Test procedures for the various quality control tests are indicated in the respective Sections 
of these Specifications or for certain tests within this Section.  Where no specific testing 
procedure is mentioned, the tests shall be carried out as per the prevalent accepted 
engineering practice to the directions of the Engineer.

Test cubes of 150 mm size shall be made immediately from each mix sample.
Cubes shall be made in accordance with the methods described in IS:516 except that the 
cubes shall be compacted by means of a vibratory hammer with the moulds placed on a 
level and rigid base.  The vibrating hammer shall be electric or pneumatic type fitted with a 
square or rectangular foot having an area of between 7500 to 14000 sq.mm.  The compaction 
shall be uniformly applied for 60± 5 seconds with a downward force of between 300 N and 
400 N on to each of the three layers of the lean concrete material placed into the mould.  The 
surface of each compacted layer shall be scarified before the next layer is added to give key 
for the next layer.  The final layer shall be finished flush with the top of the cube mould.
The dry lean concrete shall be cured in accordance with IS:516.
903.5.1.2	
In-situ Density
The dry density of the laid material shall be determined from three density holes at locations 
equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects each 2000 sq.m or part thereof laid each day 
and shall comply with the requirements as per Clause 601.6.5.1. This rate of testing may 
be increased at the discretion of the Engineer in case of doubt or to determine the extent of 
defective area in the event of non-compliance.  Density holes at random may be made to 
check the density at edges.
903.5.1.3	
Thickness
The average thickness of the subbase layer as computed by the level data of sub-base and 
subgrade or lower sub-base shall be as per the thickness specified in the contract drawings. 
The thickness at any single location shall not be 8 mm less than the specified thickness. 
Such areas shall be corrected as stated in Clause 601.6.5.5.  Areas which cannot be repaired 
should be replaced over full width.  The extent of deficient area should be decided based on 
cores.

Sampling and Testing of Beam and Cube Specimens
At least three  beams and three cube specimens, one set of three each for 7 day and 
28 day strength tests shall be cast for every 150 cu.m (or part thereof) of concrete placed 
during construction.  On each day’s work, not less than three pairs of beams and cubes 



======================================================================
PAGE 450 of 903
======================================================================
Quality Control for Road Works
Section 900
431
shall be made for each type of mix from the concrete delivered to the paving plant.  Each 
pair shall be from a different delivery of concrete and tested at a place to be designated 
by the Engineer in accordance with the testing procedure as outlined in Clause 602.3.3. 
Groups of four consecutive results from single specimens tested at 28 days shall be used 
for assessing the strength for compliance with the strength requirements.  The specimens 
shall be transported in an approved manner to prevent sudden impact causing fractures or 
damage to the specimen.  The flexural strength test results shall prevail over compressive 
strength tests for compliance.
903.5.2.2	
A quality control chart indicating the strength values of individual specimens 
shall be maintained for continuous quality assurance.  Where the requirements are not met 
with, or where the quality of the concrete or its compaction is suspect, the actual strength 
of the concrete in the slab shall be ascertained by carrying out tests on cores cut at the rate 
of 2 cores for every 150 cu.m of concrete.  The average of the results of crushing strength 
tests on these cores shall not be less than 0.8 x 0.85 times the corresponding characteristic 
compressive strength of cubes, where the height to diameter ratio of the cores is two.  Where 
height to diameter ratio is not two, necessary corrections shall be made in calculating the 
crushing strength of cubes in the following manner.
The crushing strengths of cylinders with height to diameter ratios between 1 and 2 may be 
corrected to correspond to a standard cylinder of height to diameter ratio of 2 by multiplying 
with the correction factor obtained from the following equation:
	
	
	
	
f = 0.11 n+0.78
where	
f = correction factor and
	
n = height to diameter ratio
The corrected test results shall be analysed for conformity with the specification requirements 
for cube samples.  Where the core tests are satisfactory, they shall have precedence for 
assessing concrete quality over the results of moulded specimens.  The diameter of cores 
shall not be less than 150 mm.
If, however, the tests on cores also confirm that the concrete is not satisfying the strength 
requirements, then the concrete corresponding to the area from which the cores were cut 
should be replaced, i.e., at least over an area extending between two transverse joints where 
the defects could be isolated or over larger area, if necessary, as assessed by additional 
cores and their test results.  The equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be estimated in 
accordance with Clause 602.3.3.2.
In order to ensure that the specified minimum strength at 28 days is attained in 
1 in 20 of all test beams, the mix shall be proportioned to give an average strength at 28 
days exceeding the specified strength by 1.65 times the standard deviation calculated first 
from the flexural strengths of test beams made from the trial mix and subsequently from the 
accumulating result of flexural strengths of job control test beams.

Section 900
Quality Control for Road Works
432
The standard deviation shall be re-calculated from the test results obtained after any change 
in the source or quality of materials and the mix shall be adjusted as necessary to comply 
with the requirements.
An individual 28 day test strength below the specified strength shall not be evidence for 
condemnation of the concrete concerned if the average 28 day strength of this beam plus 
the preceding 5 and succeeding 4 beams exceeds the specified strength by 1.65 times 
the standard deviation and provided that there is no other evidence that the concrete mix 
concerned is substandard.
Beams shall be made each day in pairs at intervals, each pair being from a different batch of 
concrete.  At the start of the work, and until such time as the Engineer may order a reduction 
in the number of beams required, at least six pairs of beams and cubes shall be made each 
day, one of each pair for testing at 28 days for determination of minimum permissible flexural 
strength and the other for testing at an early age for the Engineer to assess the quality of 
the mix.  When the first thirty number of 28-day results are available, and for so long as the 
Engineer is satisfied with the quality of the mix, he may reduce the number of beams and 
cubes required.
During the course of construction, when the source of any material is to be changed, or if 
there is any variation in the quality of the materials furnished, additional tests and necessary 
adjustments in the mix shall be made as required to obtain the specified strength.
The flexural strengths obtained on beams tested before 28 days shall be used in conjunction 
with a correlation between them and the 28 day flexural strengths to detect any deterioration in 
the quality of the concrete being produced.  Any such deterioration shall be remedied without 
awaiting the 28 day strengths but the earlier strengths shall not constitute sole evidence of 
non-compliance of the concrete from which they were taken.
Concrete shall be deemed not to comply with the Specification when more than one test 
beam in a batch has a 28 day strength less than the specified strength and the average 28 
day flexural strength of the batch of beams is less than the specified strength plus 1.65 times 
the standard deviation of the batch.
Should the concrete fail to comply with the Specification for strength as described above, 
the Contractor may, all at his own expense, elect to cut cores from the suspect concrete as 
the Engineer shall direct.  From the relation between cube strength and flexural strength, the 
core strength shall be converted to flexural strength.
The equivalent flexural strength at 28 days shall be the estimated in-situ strength multiplied 
by 100 and divided by the age-strength relation obtained from Table 900-5.
Any concrete that fails to meet the strength specification shall be removed and replaced at 
Contractor’s expense.

In-situ Density
 The density of the compacted concrete shall be such that the total air voids are not more 
than 3 percent. The air voids shall be derived from the difference between the theoretical 
maximum dry density of the concrete calculated from the specific gravity of the constituents 
of the concrete mix and the average value of three direct density measurements made on 
cores at least 150 mm diameter. Three cores shall be taken from trial lengths and in first two 
km length of the pavement, while the slab is being constructed during normal working.  The 
proportions of the mix and the vibratory effort imparted i.e. the frequency and magnitude of 
vibration shall be adjusted to achieve the maximum density.
All cores taken for density measurement in the trial section shall also be checked for thickness. 
The same cores shall be made use of for determining in-situ strength. In case of doubt, 
additional cores may be ordered by the Engineer and taken at locations decided by him to 
check the density of concrete slab or the position of dowel/tie bars without any compensation 
being paid for the same.
In calculation of the density, allowance shall be made for any steel in cores.
Cores removed from the main carriageway shall be reinstated with compacted concrete with 
mix proportions of 1 part of Portland cement : 2 parts of fine aggregate:2 parts of 10 mm 
nominal size single sized coarse aggregate by weight.  Before filling the fine mix, the sides 
shall be hacked and cleaned with water.  Thereafter cement-sand slurry shall be applied to 
the sides just prior to filling the concrete mix.
903.5.2.4	
Thickness
Thickness shall be controlled by taking levels as indicated in Clause 902.3.  Thickness of 
the slab at any point checked as mentioned above shall be within a tolerance of -5 mm to 
+ 10 mm of the specified thickness as per Drawing. Thickness deficiency more than 
5 mm may be accepted and paid for at a reduced rate given in Clause 602.16.3.  In no case, 
however, thickness deficiency shall be more than 10 mm.

Section 1100
457
1101	
DESCRIPTION
1101.1	
This work shall consist of construction of all types of piles for structures in 
accordance with the details shown on the drawings and conforming to the requirements of 
these Specifications or as directed by the Engineer.
1101.2	
The construction of pile foundations requires a careful choice of the piling 
system depending on subsoil conditions and loading characteristics and type of structure. 
The permissible limits of total and differential settlements, unsupported length of pile under 
scour, impact/entanglement of floating bodies and any other special requirements of project, 
are also equally important criteria for selection of the piling system.  The method of installing 
the piles, including details of the equipment shall be submitted by the Contractor and got 
approved from the Engineer before commencement of work.
1101.3	
The work shall be carried out as per IS:2911 except as modified herein.
1102	
SUBSURFACE  INVESTIGATIONS
1102.1	
The complete subsurface investigations of strata in which pile foundations 
are proposed shall be carried out in advance along with in-situ pile tests.  For details of 
geo-technical subsurface explorations, refer Section 2400 of these Specifications.
Borings should be carried up to sufficient depths so as to ascertain the nature of strata 
around the pile shaft and below the pile tip.  Depth of boring shall not be less than:
	
i)	
1.5 times estimated length of pile in soil or 15 m below the proposed 
founding level
	
ii)	
15 times diameter of pile in ordinary / jointed rock but minimum 15 m in 
such rock
	
iii)	
4 times diameter of pile in hard rock but minimum 3 m in such rock
1102.2	
The subsurface investigations shall adequately define stratification of 
substrata including the nature and type of strata, their variation, extent and specific properties. 
The investigations shall be adequate for the purpose of selection of appropriate piling system 
and for estimating design capacities for different diameters and length of piles.
1102.3	
Pressure meter tests may be used in the case of rock, ground or soil for 
direct evaluation of strength and compressibility characteristics.  Though these tests are of 
specialized nature, they are more appropriate for difficult/uncertain substrata and especially 
for important projects.
1102.4	
For piles socketed into rock, it is necessary to determine the uni-axial 
compressive strength of the rock and its quality.



======================================================================
PAGE 477 of 903

Section 1100
Pile Foundations
458
The investigations shall also include location of ground water table and other parameters 
including results of chemical tests showing sulphate and chloride content and any other 
deleterious chemical content in soil and/or ground water, likely to affect durability.
1103	
TYPE  OF  PILES
1103.1	
Piles may be of reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel or timber 
and circular, square, hexagonal, octagonal, “H” or “I” Section in shape.  They may be of solid 
or hollow sections or steel cases filled with concrete. Timber piles may be used for temporary 
bridges. Cast in-situ concrete piles may be driven cast in-situ or bored cast in-situ. Similarly, 
precast concrete piles also may be driven precast or bored precast. In bored precast piles, 
precast piles are lowered into pre-formed bores and annular space grouted.
1103.2	
Minimum diameter of concrete pile shall be 1 m for river/marine bridges. 
For bridges beyond the water zone and bridges on land, the minimum diameter may be 
750 mm.
1104	
MATERIALS
1104.1	
The basic materials shall conform to Section 1000 of these Specifications. 
The specifications for steel reinforcement, structural concrete, prestressed concrete and 
structural steel to be used in pile foundations shall conform to Sections 1600, 1700, 1800 
and 1900 respectively of these Specifications.
1104.2	
Concrete in Piles
For both precast and cast in in-situ piles, the grade of concrete, minimum cement content, 
water cement ratio and slump at the time of placement shall be as per Table 1100-1 :

459
High alumina cements (i.e. quick setting cement) shall not be used in marine conditions. 
When both chlorides and sulphates are present, in soil or ground water, sulphate resistant 
cement shall not be used.  For improving resistance against the penetration of chlorides and 
sulphates from surrounding soils or water, mineral admixtures such as fly ash, silica fumes, 
GGBS conforming to respective BIS/International Standards and as per IRC:112, may be 
used.
1105	
TEST  PILES
1105.1	
Test piles which are shown on the drawings or specified in the contract or 
installed by the Contractor on his own to determine the lengths of piles to be furnished, shall 
conform to the requirements for piling as indicated in these Specifications. Test piles which 
are used to arrive at the load carrying capacity shall not be incorporated in the structure.
All test piles shall be installed with the same type of equipment that is proposed to be used 
for piling in the actual structure.
Test piles which are not to be incorporated in the completed structure shall be removed to at 
least 600 mm below the proposed soffit level of pile cap and the remaining hole so formed 
shall be backfilled with earth or other suitable material.
The piles shall be load tested in accordance with provisions laid down in this Section.
1106	
PRECAST  CONCRETE  PILES
1106.1	
General
Precast concrete piles shall be of the size and shape as shown in the approved drawings. 
If a square section is employed, the corners shall be chamfered by at least 25 mm 
unless otherwise specified on the drawings.  The length of pile shall not normally exceed 
25 m.  However, where special equipments for handling and installation are available to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer, longer length could be permitted.
1106.2	
Stacking, Storing and Handling
Care shall be taken that at all stages of transporting, lifting and handling, the piles are not 
damaged or cracked.  During transport and stacking of piles, they shall be supported at the 
same points as those provided for lifting purposes.  If the piles are put down temporarily 
during handling, they shall be placed on trestles or blocks located at the same points.
Piles shall be stored at least 300 mm above firm level ground, which is not liable to unequal 
subsidence or settlement under the weight of the stack of piles.  They shall be placed on 
timber supports which are level and spaced so as to avoid bending.  The supports in different 
layers, shall be vertically one above the other.  Spaces shall be left round the piles to enable 



======================================================================

them to be lifted without difficulty.  The order of stacking shall be such that the older piles can 
be withdrawn without disturbing newer piles.  Separate stacks shall be provided for different 
lengths of piles.  Where piles are stacked in layers, the number of layers shall not exceed 
three.  Whenever curing is needed during storage, arrangements shall be made to enable the 
piles to be watered.  For detailed precautions with regard to curing operations for structural 
concrete, refer Section 1700 of these Specifications.
Before the operation of handling and driving the piles, the minimum periods counted from the 
time of casting shall be as indicated in Table 1100-2.  Prestressed pile shall not be lifted or 
handled until fully stressed.

Lengthening of Piles
Where a pile is to have additional length cast on it during driving, the longitudinal reinforcement 
shall preferably be joined by full penetration butt welding.  The concrete at the top of the 
original pile shall be cut down to expose not less than 200 mm of the bars to avoid spalling 
of the concrete by heat of welding.  The added bars have to be held accurately and rigidly in 
position during welding.  Where facilities on site are insufficient to make proper butt welding 
practicable, the joint may be made by lapping.  The reinforcement at the head of pile will need 
to be exposed for full anchorage length or 600 mm whichever is greater and the new bars 
over-lapped for this distance.  Unless otherwise specified, the extension of the pile shall be 
formed to the same cross-sectional profile and with concrete of at least the same strength 
as that specified for the original pile.  The stirrup spacing shall in no case be greater than 
150 mm.  Not more than one extension shall be permitted.  In case more than one extension 
is permitted by the Engineer, only approved  mechanical couplers shall be used.
Driving shall not be resumed until:
	
a)	
The strength of the concrete in the extension is at least equal to the 
specified characteristic strength of concrete in pile; and
	
b)	
The approval of the Engineer has been obtained.

Section 1100
461
1106.4	
Removal of Surplus Length
Any length of pile surplus to that required for incorporation in the structure shall be cut off 
neatly and removed.  During the process of cutting off, it shall be ensured that projecting 
reinforcement to be anchored into the pile cap and the prestressing strands/wires are not 
damaged.  When stripping prestressed concrete piles, sudden release of tendons shall be 
avoided.  Reference may also be made to Clause 7.7.1 of IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3) in this 
connection.
1106.5	
Risen Piles
Level of top of each pile shall be taken after driving and again after all the piles are driven. 
Piles which are found to have risen due to ground heave or as a result of driving adjacent 
piles, shall be re-driven to the original depth or resistance unless re-driving tests on adjacent 
piles have shown this to be unnecessary.
1106.6	
Manufacture
The pile should be cast in one continuous operation from end to end of each pile.  Manufacture 
of precast concrete piles shall conform to the guidelines contained in Clause 7.1, 7.2 
and 7.3. or IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3).
Piles shall be provided with suitable metal shoe for protecting the tip of the pile during driving 
in hard ground.
Piles shall not be moved from casting bed until the concrete has hardened sufficiently.
Piles shall not be driven in less than 28 days after casting or unless their strength at the time 
of driving is at least that specified for 28 days.
1106.7	
Prestressed Concrete Piles
Additional specifications for precast prestressed concrete piles shall conform to those 
contained in Clause 8 of IS:2911 (Part I, Section 3).
1107	
CAST  IN-SITU  CONCRETE  PILES
1107.1	
General
Cast in-situ concrete piles may be either installed by drilling a bore into the ground and 
removing the material or by driving a metal casing with a shoe at the tip and displacing 



======================================================================
PAGE 481 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1100
Pile Foundations
462
the material laterally.  The two types of piles are termed as “bored piles” and “driven piles” 
respectively.  Cast in-situ concrete piles may be cast in metal shells which may remain 
permanently in place.  However, other types of reinforced concrete cast in-situ piles, cased 
or uncased, may be used if in the opinion of the Engineer the soil conditions permit their use 
and if their design and the methods of placing are satisfactory.
Certain specific requirements regarding driving of cast in-situ driven piles shall be as per 
Clauses 1110 and 1111.
Any liner or borehole which is improperly located or shows partial collapses that would affect 
the load carrying capacity of the pile, shall be rejected or repaired as directed by the Engineer 
at the cost of the Contractor.
Boring shall be carried out using rotary equipment. Percussion type of equipment shall be 
used only if approved by the Engineer.
The diameter of the finished pile shall not be less than that specified. A continuous record 
shall be kept by the Engineer as to the volume of concrete placed in relation to the length of 
pile that is cast.
Defective piles shall be removed or left in place as judged convenient without affecting the 
performance of adjacent piles or pile cap. Additional piles shall be provided to replace the 
defective piles.
1107.2	
Concreting
Wherever practicable, concrete should be placed in a clean dry hole.  Prior to the placing of 
the reinforcement cage, the pile shaft shall be cleaned of all loose materials. Before concreting 
of the pile is commenced, it is essential to ensure that no debris remains at the bottom of 
the shaft, as inadequate cleaning of the base can lead to formation of a soft base or soft toe 
which may result in reduction of load bearing capacity of the pile.
Reinforcement for the pile as shown on the drawing shall be tied in place to form a cage which 
is lowered into the pile shaft. Suitable spacers shall be provided to maintain the required 
cover to reinforcing steel. Reinforcements at the bottom should not be provided with L-bends 
as these may interfere with cleaning of the pile base.
Where concrete is placed in dry and a casing is present, the top 3 m of the pile shall be 
compacted using internal vibrators.
Where the casing is withdrawn from cohesive soils for the formation of cast in-situ pile, the 
concreting should be done with necessary precautions to minimize the softening of the soil 
by excess water.  Where mud flow conditions exist, the casing of cast in-situ piles shall not 
be allowed to be withdrawn.

Section 1100
463
Care shall be taken during concreting to prevent the segregation of the ingredients. The 
displacement or distortion of reinforcement during concreting and while extracting the casing, 
shall also be avoided.
If the concrete is placed inside precast concrete tubes or consists of precast sections, these 
shall be free from cracks or other damage before being installed.
The concrete shall be properly graded, shall be self-compacting and shall not get mixed with 
soil, excess water, or other extraneous matter.  Special care shall be taken in silty clays and 
other soils which have the tendency to squeeze into the newly deposited concrete and cause 
necking.  Sufficient head of green concrete shall be maintained to prevent inflow of soil or 
water into the concrete.
The placing of concrete shall be a continuous process from the toe level to the top of the pile. 
To ensure compaction by hydraulic static heads, rate of placing concrete in the pile shaft shall 
not be less than 6 m (length of pile) per hour.
1107.3	
Casing
When concreting is carried out for a pile, a temporary casing should be installed to sufficient 
depth so as to ensure that fragments of soil from the sides of the hole do not drop into the 
concrete as it is placed. When the bore hole is stabilized using drilling mud, the temporary 
casing is not required except near the top.
The metal casing shall be of sufficient thickness and strength to hold its original form and 
show no harmful distortion while driving or when adjacent casings are driven.
Cast in-situ concrete driven piles shall be installed using a properly designed detachable 
shoe at the bottom of the casing.
Bored cast in-situ piles in soils which are stable, may often be installed with only a small 
casing length at the top.  A minimum of 2 m length of top of bore shall invariably be provided 
with casing to ensure against loose soil falling into the bore.  In cases in which the side soil 
can fall into the hole, it is necessary to stabilize the side of the bore hole with drilling mud, or 
a suitable steel casing.  Permanent steel liner shall be provided at least up to maximum scour 
level.  The minimum thickness of steel liner shall be 6 mm.
Permanent steel liner shall be provided for the full depth of the pile in the following situations 
where:
	
i)	
The surrounding soil is marine clay
	
ii)	
Soft soil is present
	
iii)	
Surrounding soil has sulphate content equal to or more than 1%

iv)	
Surrounding water has sulphate content equal to or more than 
2500 ppm
	
v)	
Leakage of sewage is expected
For bored cast in-situ piles, casing/liner shall be driven open ended with a pile driving hammer 
capable of achieving penetration of the liner to the depth shown on the drawing or as approved 
by the Engineer.  Materials inside the casing shall be removed progressively by air lift, grab 
or percussion equipment or other approved means.
Where bored cast in-situ piles are used in soils liable to flow, the bottom of the casing shall 
be kept sufficiently in advance of the boring tool to prevent the entry of soil into the casing, 
leading to formation of cavities and settlements in the adjoining ground.  The water level in 
the casing should generally be maintained at the natural ground water level for the same 
reasons.  The joints of the casing shall be made as leak-tight as possible to minimize inflow 
of water or leakage of slurry during concreting.
The diameter of the boreholes shall not be more than the inside diameter of the liner when the 
liners are installed before boring. When the liners are installed after boring, the diameter of 
the boreholes shall not be more than the outside diameter of liner + 2 mm, unless otherwise 
approved by Engineer.
1107.4	
Use of Tremie
The concrete should invariably be poured through a tremie with a funnel, so that the concrete 
can be properly deposited in the hole without segregation. For concreting done by tremie, the 
following requirements which are particularly applicable shall be ensured:
	
a)	
The hopper and tremie should be a leak proof system.
	
b)	
Diameter of tremie shall be not less than 200 mm for use with 20 mm 
diameter down aggregate.
	
c)	
The first charge of concrete should be placed with a sliding plug pushed 
down the tube ahead of it or with a steel plate with adequate charge to 
prevent mixing of concrete and water.  However, the plug should not be 
left in the concrete as a lump.
	
d)	
The tremie pipe should always penetrate well into the concrete with an 
adequate margin of safety against accidental withdrawal of the pipe. 
The tremie should be always full of concrete.
	
e)	
The pile should be concreted wholly by tremie and the method of 
deposition should not be changed part way up the pile, to prevent 
laitance from being entrapped within the pile.
	
f)	
All tremie tubes shall be thoroughly cleaned after use.

g)	
For concrete placed through tremie, there is no need to add 10 percent 
extra cement.
	
h)	
Concreting of piles shall be carried out continuously. In exceptional 
cases of interruption of concreting the tremie shall not be taken out of 
the concrete under any circumstances. The tremie pipe shall be raised 
and lowered slowly from time to time to prevent it from getting stuck in 
the concrete while ensuring its lower and does not come out of concrete. 
The concreting shall be resumed before final setting time of concrete, 
which shall be established before the start of the piling operation. For 
achieving longer setting time of the concrete, super plasticizers having 
retarding properties/retarders can be used. If any of these requirements 
are not met, the pile shall be rejected.
1107.5	
Removal of Concrete above Cut-off Level
It is desirable that the concrete above cut-off level, is removed before the concrete is set. 
This may be done manually or by specially made bailer or other device. Such removal of 
concrete helps in preventing the damage of the good concrete below the cut-off level, which 
results from chipping by percussion method.
The removal of concrete shall be within ± 25 mm from the specified cut off level, preferably 
on the minus side.  After removal of such concrete, the concrete shall be compacted with 
rammer with spikes or vibrated.
In case the concrete is not removed before setting, a groove shall be made on outer perimeter 
by rotary equipment before chipping by percussion method.
The minimum embedment of cast in-situ concrete piles into pile cap shall  not be less then 
50 mm. Any defective concrete at the head of the completed pile shall be cut away and 
made good with new concrete.  The clear cover between the bottom reinforcement in pile 
cap from the top of the pile shall be not less than 25 mm.  The reinforcement in the pile shall 
be exposed for full anchorage length to permit it to be adequately bonded into the pile cap. 
Exposing such length shall be done carefully to avoid damaging the rest of the pile.
1108	
STEEL  PILES
Steel piles shall be of “H” or “I” sections as shown on the drawings and shall be of structural 
steel conforming to Section 1000 of these Specifications.
Steel piles shall be protected by suitable anti-corrosive painting as specified on the drawing 
or as directed by the Engineer.  Piles shall be stored above the ground having protective 
packing to minimize damage to surface coating.  Each pile shall be supplied preferably in one 
piece without splices.



======================================================================
PAGE 485 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1100
Pile Foundations
466
At the option of the Contractor, steel piles consisting of structural steel plates welded together 
may be substituted for the rolled sections specified, provided the depth, width and average 
thicknesses are at least equal to those of the rolled sections, the steel plates conform to 
Section 1000 of these Specifications. The flanges shall be welded to the web with continuous 
fillet welds on either side of the web, and the welding shall conform to Clause 1904.8 of these 
Specifications.
The length of the steel pile may be built up in sections either before or during driving 
operations.  The sections shall be of identical cross-section.  Pile splices shall be made with 
full penetration butt welds over the whole cross-section.  Pile splices shall develop at least 
the yield strength of pile.
The connections shall be made by butt welding the entire cross-section in accordance with 
the provisions in Clause 1904.8 of these Specifications.  Care shall be taken to properly align 
the sections connected so that the axis of the pile will be straight. The number of welded 
connections in the length of pile shall be as few as possible.
1109	
TIMBER  PILES
The Engineer shall stamp each pile on the butt with a stamp which shall make an impression 
that is readily legible.  Treated timber piles will be inspected by the Engineer after treatment. 
Untreated timber piles may be used as test piles. Treated timber piles shall be driven within 
6 months after treatment.
Timber piles shall be furnished with tip protection and protected by the use of steel straps. 
Tip protection shall be suitable for use on timber piling of the size to be driven.  Details of tip 
protection shall be furnished to the Engineer for review and approval before driving piles.  Not 
less than 2 separate steel straps shall be placed within 600 mm of the butt of each pile after 
the pile is square cut.  Not less than 2 separate steel straps shall be placed within 300 mm 
of the tip of each pile.  Additional intermediate steel straps shall be placed at intervals of not 
more than 3 m measured along the length of the pile.
Timber piles which are to be capped shall be separately cut off so that true bearing is obtained 
on every pile.  Piles inaccurately cut off shall be replaced.  Splicing of timer piles shall not be 
permitted except by written permission of the Engineer.
1110	
DRIVING  EQUIPMENT
Piles or their casings may be driven with any type of drop hammer, diesel hammer or single-
acting steam or compressed air hammer, provided they penetrate to the prescribed depth to 
attain the designed resistance without being damaged.  The weight or power of the hammer 
should be sufficient to ensure a penetration of at least 5 mm per blow unless rock has been 
reached.  It is always preferable to employ the heaviest hammer practicable and to limit the 
stroke, so as not to damage the pile.  The minimum weight of the hammer shall be 2.5t. In 



======================================================================
PAGE 486 of 903
======================================================================
Pile Foundations
Section 1100
467
the case of precast concrete piles the mass of the hammer shall be not less than 30 times 
the mass of 300 mm length of pile.
Steam or air hammers shall be furnished along with boiler or air compressor of capacity at 
least equal to that specified by the manufacturer of the hammers.  The boiler or air compressor 
shall be equipped with an accurate pressure gauge at all times. The valve mechanism and 
other parts of steam, air or diesel hammers shall be maintained in first class condition so that 
the length of stroke and number of blows per minute for which the hammer is designed, will 
be obtained.  Inefficient steam, air or diesel hammers shall not be permitted to be used on 
the work.
1111	
DRIVING
1111.1	
General Procedure
Details of the equipment and the method proposed for driving the piles shall be submitted 
for scrutiny and approval of the Engineer.  Piles shall be installed from firm ground or from 
temporary supports or from fixed platform.  The arrangement shall provide sufficient rigidity 
to ensure accuracy of pile driving under all conditions of tide, stream flow or hammer drop.
During driving the top of pile shall be protected by a suitable helmet of substantial steel 
construction.  The helmet shall provide uniform bearing across the top of the pile and shall 
hold the pile centrally under the hammer.  No pile shall be driven unless inspected and 
approved by the Engineer.
Piles shall be driven from a fixed frame of sufficient rigidity to ensure accuracy of driving 
within specified tolerances.  The force of the hammer shall be directed centrally and axially 
during driving. Forces producing undue bending or torsional stresses in piles shall not be 
applied during driving.
The stroke of a single acting or drop hammer shall be limited to 1.2 m unless otherwise 
permitted by the Engineer.  A shorter stroke may be necessary when there is danger of 
damaging the pile.
Piles shall not be bent or sprung into position but shall be effectively guided and held on line 
during the initial stages of driving.  Attempts to correct any tendency for the pile to run off line 
by the application of significant horizontal restraint will not be permitted.  Shortly after the 
commencement of driving and at regular intervals throughout the driving operation, checks 
shall be made to ensure that the pile frame does not exert any undue lateral force on the pile 
due to restraint within the helmet.
If the indications are that a pile will finish outside the specified tolerances, driving operations 
on that pile will cease.  The pile shall be withdrawn, the hole filled and the pile re-driven at 
the cost of the Contractor.



======================================================================
PAGE 487 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1100
Pile Foundations
468
To avoid the possibility of premature “set-up”, pile driving shall be continuous in the later 
stages, without any deliberate stops.  (delays of an hour or less may lead to significant “set-
up” in piles i.e. resistance to further driving increases after driving is stopped).
If any pile is damaged in any way during driving, it shall be repaired or replaced as directed by 
the Engineer, at the cost of the Contractor.  If during driving, the head of a pile is damaged to 
the extent that further driving is not possible, the head shall be cut off and driving continued. 
The cost of cutting off shall be borne by the Contractor and where, as a result of such cutting 
off the head, the pile is too short, the Contractor, shall, at his own cost, supply and splice on 
sufficient length of pile to restore the pile to its correct length.
Piles should be driven to the minimum acceptable penetration shown on the drawings.  This 
may require pre-boring and/or jetting as indicated in Clause 111.2, with the  approval of the 
Engineer.
Piles shall be driven to nominal refusal or the required ultimate dynamic capacity mentioned 
on the drawings or until the top of the pile is at the level required and specified on the drawing 
whichever gives the lowest toe elevation.  The Engineer’s decision in these matters shall be 
final.  Nominal refusal shall be taken as equivalent to 25 mm total penetration for the final 
20 blows using a hammer of driving energy as specified and shall be used as the criterion 
for acceptance for piles founded on rock.  Severe driving which results in an average set per 
blow less than 0.5 mm will not be permitted.
Where hard drilling is encountered because of dense strata or obstructions located above the 
predetermined pile tip level, nominal refusal shall not be considered to have been achieved 
unless the Engineer is satisfied that the total number of blows, as the average driving 
resistance specified for nominal refusal, indicates that further driving will not advance the pile 
through dense strata or obstructions.
The pile shall be driven as accurately as possible to the vertical or to specified batter. Straining 
the pile into position can damage it and the driving equipment should be adjusted as much 
as possible to follow the position of the pile.  Any deviation from the proper alignment shall 
be noted and promptly reported to the Engineer.  If the deviation is to such an extent that the 
resulting eccentricity cannot be taken care of by strengthening the pile cap or pile tips, such 
a pile shall, at the discretion of the Engineer, be replaced or supplemented by an additional 
pile.  Unless otherwise specified, the permissible positional deviation for piles shall be limited 
to those indicated in Clause 1116.
Care shall be taken not to damage the pile by over-driving.  Any sudden change in the rate of 
penetration which cannot be ascribed in the nature of the ground shall be noted and its cause 
ascertained, if possible, before driving is continued.
While withdrawing a casing used in the construction of cast in-situ pile, consideration shall be 
given to the possibility of damaging any other nearby pile.  The danger of damaging is greater 



======================================================================

Section 1100
469
in compact soils than in loose soils.  No pile shall be bored or driven within 3 m of a newly 
cast pile until at least 24 hours after completion of its installation.
Driving piles in loose sand tends to compact the sand which in turn increases the skin friction. 
Therefore, driving a number of friction piles in a group shall proceed outward from the centre 
as otherwise it will be difficult to drive the inner piles to the same depth as the others.
In the case of stiff clay also, the driving for a group of piles shall proceed outward from the 
centre.  However, in case of very soft soil, the driving may proceed from outside to inside, so 
that the soil is restrained from flowing out during driving operations.
If there is a major variation between the depth at which adjacent foundation piles in a group 
meet refusal, a boring shall be made nearby to ascertain the cause of this difference.  If the 
boring shows that the soil contains pockets of highly compressive material below the level of 
the shorter pile, it will be necessary to enforce penetration of all the piles to a level below the 
bottom of the zone which shows such pockets.
1111.2	
Pre-boring and Jetting
Driving of the piles may be assisted by pre-boring holes or by the use of jets or both, subject 
to the approval of the Engineer.  These may be used essentially to achieve the minimum 
penetration shown on the drawings where such penetration is not reached under normal 
conditions of driving indicated in Clause 1111.1.
The diameter of the hole shall not be greater than the diagonal dimension of the pile less 
100 mm.
The maximum depth of the pre-boring shall be such that the specified set (or less) is obtained 
when the toe of the pile is at founding level.  Pre-boring shall be as approved by the Engineer 
and shall be carried out only up to a level of one metre above the founding level. The pile 
shall be driven for at least one metre below the pre-bored hole.  To ensure that the pile is 
properly supported laterally in the hole, any space remaining around the pile at the ground 
level after driving is completed, shall be backfilled with approved granular material.
When water jetting is used, at least two jets shall be attached to the pile symmetrically.  The 
volume and pressure of water at the outlet nozzles shall be sufficient to freely erode material 
adjacent to the toe of the pile.  The maximum depth up to which jetting is carried out, shall be 
such that the specified set (or less) is obtained when the toe of the pile is at founding level. 
Jetting shall cease as directed by the Engineer and shall proceed only up to 1 m above the 
founding level. The pile shall be driven at least 1 m below the pre-bored hole.
To avoid very hard driving and vibration in materials such as sand, jetting of piles by means 
of water may be carried out only with the express permission of the Engineer and in such a 



======================================================================

Section 1100
Pile Foundations
470
manner as not to impair the bearing capacity of piles already in place, the stability of the soil 
or the safety of any adjoining buildings.  Details of the arrangement for jetting shall be got 
approved from the Engineer in advance.
If large quantities of water are used for jetting, provision shall be made for collecting and 
draining away of water when it comes to the surface of the ground, so that the stability of the 
piling plant is not endangered by the softening of the ground.
Jetting shall be stopped before completing the driving which shall always be finished by 
ordinary methods.  Jetting shall be stopped if there is any tendency for the pile tips to be 
drawn towards the pile already driven owing to the disturbance of the ground.
1112	
RAKER  (INCLINED)  PILES
The maximum rake to be permitted in piles shall not exceed the following:
	
I)	
1 in 6 for all bored piles
	
ii)	
1 in 6 for  cast in-situ piles
	
iii)	
1 in 4 for precast driven piles
1113	
PILE  TESTS
1113.1	
Initial Load Test
	
i)	
The number of initial tests shall be determined by the Engineer taking 
into consideration the bore log and soil profile, design length, pile 
diameter and design pile capacity. However, it shall not be less than 
two for each category.
	
ii)	
Initial load test for axial load capacity, including uplift capacity if required, 
on trial piles of the same diameter as of the design pile, shall be carried 
out after 28 days design strength is achieved.  The testing shall be done 
as per the procedure laid down in IS:2911, Part-IV.  The load test shall 
be conducted for not less than 2½ times the design load.  The initial 
load test shall be cyclic load test for piles deriving strength from end 
bearing and side friction.  The maintained load test can be performed 
for end bearing piles which do not rely on friction and for piles socketed 
in rock;
	
iii)	
If the initial load test gives a capacity greater than 25 percent of the 
capacity calculated by static formula and if it is desired to take benefit 
of the higher capacity, another two load tests shall be carried out to 
confirm the earlier value and minimum of the three shall be considered 



======================================================================
PAGE 490 of 903
======================================================================
Pile Foundations
Section 1100
471
as initial load test value. The number of initial tests shall be determined 
by the Engineer taking into consideration the bore log and soil profile.
	
iv)	
Lateral load tests shall be carried out for estimating the lateral load 
capacity of the piles. The test procedure shall be carried out as per 
IS 2911 part IV. However the permissible deflection shall be as per 
IRC:78.
	
v)	
In particular cases where upper part of pile is likely to be exposed later 
due to scour, then the capacity contributed by that portion of the pile 
during load test, shall be accounted for.
1113.2	
Routine Load Tests
Routine load test shall be carried out at actual locations of foundations of bridges to re-confirm 
or modify the allowable loads. The lateral load test may be conducted on two adjacent piles. 
However, results of routine load tests shall not be used for upward revision of design capacity 
of piles. The minimum number of tests to be conducted for confirming the capacity shall be 
as per Table 1100-3.
Table 1100-3 : Minimum Number of Tests
Total Number of Piles for the Bridge
          Minimum Number of Test Piles
Upto 50

3
Beyond 150
2% of total piles (fractional number rounded  to 
next higher integer number)
Note:	
The number of tests may be judiciously increased depending upon the variability of 
foundation strata. For determining the number of piles to be tested for the routine test 
the total no. of piles under all structures of left and right carriageway and the service road 
shall be taken together provided length and diameters of the piles are the same.
1113.3	
Permissible Overload
While conducting routine test on one of the piles belonging to a pile group, if the pile capacity 
is found to be deficient (based on the settlement criteria of 12 mm for piles of diameter up 
to and including 600 mm and 2 percent of the pile diameter for piles of diameter more than 
600 mm at 1.5 times the design load) an overload up to 10 percent of the capacity may be 
allowed. 
1113.4	
For a quick assessment of pile capacity, strain dynamic tests may be 
conducted after establishing co-relation using the results of load tests. However, results of 
strain dynamic tests shall not be used for upward revision of design capacity of pile. Detailed 
guidelines and references are given in IRC:78. These methods can be followed.



======================================================================
PAGE 491 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1100
Pile Foundations
472
To have a fairly good idea about the quality of concrete and construction defects like voids, 
discontinuities etc., pile integrity tests are extensively conducted.  Detailed guidelines in this 
connection are given in IRC:78.
1114	
PILE  CAP
Casting of pile cap should be at a level higher than low water level unless functionally required 
to be below low water level. In such cases dewatering shall be resorted to allow concreting 
in dry conditions. Pile caps shall be of reinforced concrete. A minimum offset of 150 mm shall 
be provided beyond the outer faces of the outermost piles in the group. If the pile cap is in 
contact with earth at the bottom, a leveling course of minimum 80 mm thickness of M 15 
nominal mix concrete shall be provided.  In marine conditions or areas exposed to the action 
of harmful chemicals, the pile cap shall be protected with a coating such as bituminous based 
coaltar epoxy or epoxy based coating or with suitable anti corrosive paint. Concrete with high 
alumina cement, shall not be used in marine environment.
The attachment of the pile head to the cap shall be adequate for the transmission of loads and 
forces.  A portion of pile top may be stripped of concrete and the reinforcement anchored into 
the cap.  Manual chipping may be permitted three days after casting of pile, while pneumatic 
tools for chipping shall be permitted only seven days after casting of pile.  The top of pile after 
stripping shall project at least 50 mm into the pile cap.
The top of concrete in a pile shall be brought above cut-off level to permit removal of all 
laitance and weak concrete before pile cap is laid.  This will ensure good concrete at the cut-
off level.
1115	
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS, INSPECTION/PRECAUTIONS FOR 
DIFFERENT  TYPES  OF  PILES
1115.1	
Driven Cast In-Situ Piles
1115.1.1	
Specialist literature and the guidelines from the pile construction industry 
shall be consulted regarding the method of installation, equipment and accessories for pile 
driving and recording of data.
1115.1.2	
During installation of piles, the final “set” of penetration of pile per blow of 
hammer shall be checked taking an average of last 10 blows.
1115.1.3	
The pile shoes which may be of either cast iron conical type or mild steel 
flat type shall have double reams for proper seating of the removable casing tube inside the 
space between the reams.



======================================================================
PAGE 492 of 903
======================================================================
Pile Foundations
Section 1100
473
1115.1.4	
Before commencement of pouring of concrete, it shall be ensured that there 
is no ingress of water in the casing tube from the bottom.  Further, adequate control during 
withdrawal of the casing tube is essential so as to maintain sufficient head of concrete inside 
the casing tube at all stages of withdrawal.
1115.1.5	
Concrete in piles shall be cast up to a minimum height of 600 mm above the 
designed top level of pile, which shall be stripped off at the time of construction of pile cap.
1115.2	
Bored Cast In-Situ Piles
1115.2.1	
While concreting uncased piles, voids in concrete shall be avoided and 
sufficient head of concrete is to be maintained to prevent inflow of soil or water into the 
concrete.  It is also necessary to take precautions during concreting to minimize the softening 
of the soil by excess water.  Uncased cast in-situ piles shall not be allowed where mudflow 
conditions exist.
1115.2.2	
The drilling mud such as bentonite suspension shall be maintained at a 
level sufficiently above the surrounding ground water level throughout the boring process, to 
ensure the stability of the strata which is being penetrated until the pile has been concreted.
1115.2.3	
Where bentonite suspension is used to maintain the stability of the borehole, 
it is essential that the properties of the material be carefully controlled at stages of mixing, 
supply to the borehole and immediately before concrete is placed.  It is usual to limit :
	
i)	
The density of bentonite suspension to 1.05 g/cc
	
ii)	
The marsh cone viscosity between 30 and 40
	
iii)	
The pH value between 9.5 and 12
	
iv)	
The silt content less than 1 percent
	
v)	
The liquid limit of bentonite not less than 400 percent
These aspects shall act as controlling factors for preventing contamination of bentonite slurry 
for clay and silt.
1115.2.4	
The bores shall be washed by bentonite flushing to ensure clean bottom at 
two stages viz. after completion of boring and prior to concreting after placing of reinforcement 
cage. Flushing of bentonite shall be done continuously with fresh bentonite slurry till the 
consistency of inflowing and outflowing slurry is similar.
1115.2.5	
For concreting of piles using tremie, Clause 1107 of these Specifications 
may be referred.
1115.2.6	
For very long or large diameter piles, use of retarding plasticizer in concrete 
is desirable.



======================================================================
PAGE 493 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1100
Pile Foundations
474
1115.2.7	
For large diameter piles, it may be essential to conduct non-destructive pile 
integrity tests to evaluate integrity of the pile.
1115.2.8	
Where possible, it may be desirable to grout the base of pile with cement 
slurry under suitable pressure after concrete in the pile attains the desired strength.  For this 
purpose, conduit pipes with easily removable plugs at the bottom end, should be placed in 
the bore along with reinforcement cage before concreting.

Section 1200
479
1201	
DESCRIPTION
The work shall consist of construction of well foundation, taking it down to the founding level 
by sinking through all kinds of substrata, plugging the bottom, filling the well with approved 
material, plugging the top and providing a well cap, in accordance with the details shown on 
the drawings and as per these specifications, or as directed by the Engineer.
1202	
GENERAL
1202.1	
Wells may have a circular, rectangular or D-shape in plan and may consist of 
one, two or more compartments in plan.
1202.2	
In case of well foundations of size larger than 12 m diameter, supplemental 
construction specifications will be necessary.
1202.3	
The subsurface geotechnical investigations to be carried out before 
commencement of work of well foundations shall be in accordance with relevant clauses of 
Section 1900 of these Specifications.
1202.4	
In case blasting is anticipated for facilitating sinking through difficult strata 
such as boulders and rock, special protective/strengthening measures for the curb and 
steining of the well will be required.
1202.5	
Pneumatic sinking may have to be resorted to in cases where the well has 
to be sunk through rock/hard strata or where there are obstacles such as tree trunks, large 
sized boulders etc., which cannot be removed by open dredging. In such cases, the decision 
regarding adoption of pneumatic sinking shall be taken on the basis of results of confirmatory 
bores and as directed by the Engineer.
1203	
SETTING  OUT  AND  PREPARATIONS  FOR  SINKING
1203.1	
Necessary reference points shall be accurately fixed to mark x-x axis along 
the direction of traffic and y-y axis normal to direction of traffic. Such reference points shall be 
away from the zone of blow-ups or possible settlements which may result from well sinking 
operations and shall be connected to the permanent stations with the base line on the banks. 
The centre of the individual wells shall be marked with reference to these stations. The 
distances between the wells shall be checked with the help of precision instruments.
1203.2	
A temporary benchmark shall be established near the well foundation, away 
from the zone of blow-ups or possible settlement. The bench mark shall be checked regularly 
with respect to the permanent bench mark established at the bridge site.
1203.3	
For wells located on the banks of the river or in dry area, the bed may be 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Section 1200
Well Foundations
480
prepared by excavating the soil up to 1.5 m, followed by levelling and dressing before placing 
the cutting edge.
1203.4	
For wells which are to be located in water, a sand island shall be constructed 
for laying the cutting edge and well curb. Sand islands are practicable for water depths of up 
to 5 m under stable bed soil conditions. Where the depth of water is greater than 5 m or in fast 
flowing rivers or for locations where soil is too weak to sustain sand island, floating caissons 
may have to be adopted.
The plan dimensions of sand islands shall be such as to have a working space of at least 
2 m all around the steining of the well. Sand islands shall be maintained to perform their 
functions, until the well is sunk to a depth below the original bed level at least equal to the 
depth of water at that location.
The sand island shall be held in position and protected against scour by means of wooden 
ballies properly braced or sheet piles. The top level of the sand island to be decided by the 
Engineer, shall be sufficiently above the prevailing water level so that it is not affected by 
wave action.
1203.5	
Equipment shall be deployed for construction of well foundation as required 
and as directed by the Engineer. Generally, the following equipment may be required for the 
work:
	
a)	
crane with grab buckets – capacity 0.5 cum to 2.0 cum
	
b)	
submersible pumps
	
c)	
air compressors, air locks and other accessories where pneumatic 
sinking of well is anticipated
	
d)	
chisels of appropriate sizes
	
e)	
aqua-header for cutting rocky strata
	
f)	
diving helmets and accessories
	
g)	
batching plants for concrete production
	
h)	
equipment for transportation, placing and compaction of concrete
1204	
CUTTING  EDGE
1204.1	
The cutting edge shall be made from structural steel sections conforming to 
Section 1900 of these Specifications and shall be strong enough to facilitate sinking of the 
well through the type of strata expected to be encountered. The weight of the cutting edge 
shall not be less than 40 kg per metre length. It shall be properly anchored into the well curb 
as shown on the drawing.



======================================================================
PAGE 500 of 903
======================================================================
Well Foundations
Section 1200
481
1204.2	
When there are two or more compartments in a well, the bottom of the cutting 
edge of the inner walls shall be kept at about 300 mm above that of outer walls.
1204.3	
In V shaped cutting edge, the inclined plate should meet the vertical plate in 
such a way that full strength connection by welding is feasible.
1204.4	
The parts of cutting edge shall be erected on level firm ground about 300 mm 
above prevalent water level. Temporary supports shall be provided to facilitate fabrication and 
for maintaining the assembly in true shape. The fabrication may be carried out in the shop 
or at site. Steel sections shall not be heated and forced into shape. However, “V” cuts may 
be made in the horizontal portion, uniformly throughout the length, to facilitate cold bending. 
After bending, such “V” cuts should be closed by welding. Joints in the lengths of structural 
sections, unless otherwise specified, shall be fillet welded using single cover plate to ensure 
the requisite strength of the original section.
1205	
WELL  CURB
1205.1	
The well curb shall be such that it will offer minimum resistance while sinking 
but will be strong enough to be able to transmit superimposed loads from the steining to the 
bottom plug. The shape and outline dimensions of the curb shall be as shown in IRC:78. The 
internal angle of the curb shall be about 30º to 37º depending upon geotechnical data of the 
strata through which the well is to be sunk.
1205.2	
The well curb shall be in reinforced concrete having concrete mix in 
accordance with Table 1700-2 and Table 1700-3 and with minimum reinforcement of 
72 kg/cum excluding bond rods. The steel shall be suitably detailed to prevent spreading and 
splitting of curb during sinking. The outer face of the curb shall be vertical. The bottom ends 
of vertical bond rods of steining shall be fixed securely to the cutting edge with check nuts or 
by welds. Concreting of the well curb shall be done in one continuous operation.
1205.3	
Steel formwork for well curb shall be fabricated strictly in conformity with the 
drawing. The formwork on outer face of curb may be removed within 24 hours after concreting 
while that on inner face shall be removed only after 72 hours.
1205.4	
In case blasting is anticipated, the inner face of the well curb shall be 
protected with steel plates of thickness not less than 10 mm up to the top of the well curb. If 
considered necessary, the inner face of steining may also be protected with steel plates of 
6 mm thickness up to a height of 3 m above the top of the well curb or as specified by the 
Engineer. The curb as well as 3 m height of steining above the curb, shall be provided with 
additional hoop reinforcement of 10 mm diameter bars at 150 mm spacing. Additional hoop 
reinforcement shall be provided in the steining for a further height of up to two times the 
thickness of steining above the plates, so as to avoid cracking which may arise on account 
of sudden change in the effective section due to curtailment of plate.

1206	
FLOATING  CAISSONS
1206.1	
Floating caissons are generally fabricated at or near the banks on dry land or 
in dry docks and then towed into position. For floating caissons, a detailed method statement 
covering fabrication, floating and sinking operations, shall be prepared and furnished to 
the Engineer. Such statement shall include the total tonnage of steel involved, fabrication 
and welding specifications, list of materials and plant and a description of operations and 
manpower required for the work.
1206.2	
Floating caissons shall be of structural steel conforming to Section 1900 of 
these Specifications. The joints of the fabricated structure shall be absolutely leak-tight and 
shall be checked against leakage before floating and being towed to site. The reinforcement 
of the curb and steining of the well shall be fixed inside the shell by welding before the caisson 
is floated. Stability of floating caissons shall be ensured against overturning and capsizing 
under the action of water current, wave pressure and wind while being towed and kept in 
position. To maintain the stability of the shell while being floated, it may be provided with 
ballast in the form of water filling up to required level or filling with small amount of concrete. 
It shall be ensured that the draught of the floating caisson is always less than the depth of 
water available, so as to facilitate its smooth hindrance-free movement while being towed.
1206.3	
Height of caisson shall be planned to ensure that at any given time, at least 
one metre of the shell shall be above water level. In case the location is affected by the action 
of waves, the height shall be suitably increased to avoid water spilling into the caisson. In 
case the bed has soft soil, the caisson shall be provided with 3 to 5 metres of additional 
height, as it may sink by itself after grounding in bed. Simultaneous sinking and concreting is 
required to prevent caisson from tilting. In sandy stratum especially with strong water current, 
appropriate additional height of caisson is necessary for accommodating local scour.
1206.4	
The floating caisson shall be held in position against untoward movement by 
wire ropes/chains, using winches mounted on stationary suitable platforms/buoys or similar 
anchoring systems. Anchoring in minimum three directions, shall be provided to prevent 
unacceptable longitudinal and lateral movement. The anchoring system shall permit small 
movements in order to facilitate correct positioning of the caisson at the exact location of the 
well and until the stage when it is just getting grounded. Special care is necessary where 
variation in water level is frequent, e.g. in tidal zones.
1206.5	
After being held in correct position, concreting of the floating caisson shall be 
commenced. The concrete mixed in batching plants, shall be carried to the floating caisson 
on barges and placed in position through concrete pumps or tremie. When large volumes of 
concreting are involved, the batching plant concrete pump, crane etc, may all be mounted 
on a barge kept in the vicinity of the caisson. As no vibration is possible inside the shell, it 
shall be ensured that the concrete has a slump of 150 to 200; alternatively, self-compacting 
concrete can be used. The concrete shall be carefully placed uniformly all around the caisson 
so that it settles vertically without any tendency to tilt.

Section 1200
483
1207	
WELL  STEINING
1207.1	
The dimensions, shape, concrete strength and reinforcements of the well 
steining shall strictly conform to those shown on the drawings. The formwork shall preferably 
be of M.S. sheets shaped and stiffened suitably. In case timber forms are used, they shall be 
lined with plywood or M.S. sheets.
1207.2	
The height of the first lift of steining to be cast above the well curb shall not 
be more than 2 m and subsequent lifts shall not exceed the diameter of the well or the depth 
of well to be sunk below the bed level at any time. For stability, the first lift of steining shall 
be cast only after sinking the curb at least partially. Concreting of steining may be carried out 
in subsequent lifts of about 2 to 2.5 m. Attempts should be made to minimize the number of 
construction joints. The concreting layers shall be limited to 450 mm restricting the free fall of 
concrete to not more than 1.5 m. Laitance formed at the top surface of a lift shall be removed 
to expose coarse aggregates before setting of concrete at the proposed construction joint. 
As far as possible, construction joints shall not be kept at the location of laps in the vertical 
steining bars.
1207.3	
The steining of the well shall be built in one straight line from bottom to top 
such that if the well is titled, the next lift of steining will be aligned in the direction of the tilt. 
The work will be checked carefully with the aid of straight edges of lengths approved by the 
Engineer. Plumb bob or spirit level shall not be used for alignment. After sinking of a stage is 
complete, damaged portions if any, of steining at top of the previous stage shall be properly 
repaired before constructing the next stage.
1207.4	
For measuring the height of steining, it shall be marked with at least 4 gauges, 
two in traffic direction and two normal to traffic direction, distributed equally on the outer face 
of the well. The marking shall be in the form of a 100 mm wide strip painted on the steining, 
with every metre marked in black paint. Marking of the gauges shall be done carefully and 
accurately with a steel tape, starting with zero at the bottom of the cutting edge. The marking 
shall be continued upwards as each lift of steining is added.
1207.5	
After reaching the founding level, the well steining shall be inspected to 
check for any damage or cracks. The Engineer will direct and the Contractor shall execute 
the remedial measures, if required, before acceptance of the well steining. In case the well 
is found to be unacceptable even after remedial measures are carried out, then it shall stand 
rejected.
1208	
WELL  SINKING
1208.1	
General
The well shall be sunk true and vertical through all types of strata. No well shall be permitted 
to be placed in a pre-dredged hole.



======================================================================
PAGE 503 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1200
Well Foundations
484
Sinking or loading of the well with kentledge shall be commenced only after the steining has 
been cured for at least 48 hours or as specified in the drawings.
The well shall be sunk by excavating the material uniformly from inside the dredge hole 
using cranes with grab buckets of appropriate capacity. Use of water jetting, explosives and 
divers may be adopted for sinking of wells through difficult strata, with prior approval of the 
Engineer. Well sinking can also be carried out by jack down method.
Normally dewatering of well should not be permitted as a means for sinking the well. 
It shall never be resorted to if there is any danger of sand blowing under the well. Dewatering 
shall however be done when well is to be founded in rock. Pneumatic sinking may have to be 
resorted to where obstacles such as tree trunks, large sized boulders etc. are met or when 
there is hard strata which cannot be removed by open dredging. The necessity for adopting 
pneumatic sinking shall be decided by the Engineer.
Complete history of sinking of each well giving details of concreting, sinking and problems 
met, if any, shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1200/I.
1208.2	
Sand Blows in Wells
Dewatering of the well shall not be carried out if sand blows are expected. Any equipment 
or men working inside the well, shall be brought outside the well as soon as there are any 
indications of sand blow occurring. Sand blow can often be minimized by keeping the level of 
water inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding heavy kentledge.
1208.3	
Use of Kentledge for Sinking of Well
Kentledge shall be placed in an orderly and safe manner on the loading platform and in such 
a way that it does not interfere with the excavation of the material from inside the dredge hole 
and also does not in any way damage the steining of the well.
Where tilt has occurred or there is a danger of well developing a tilt, the position of the load 
shall be regulated in such a manner as to provide greater sinking effort on the higher side of 
the well.
1208.4	
Use of Water Jetting
Water jetting can be used to facilitate sinking of wells through clay/hard strata. The decision 
regarding use of water jetting shall be taken at the design stage itself, based on geotechnical 
investigations which may be indicating presence of hard, clayey strata. For carrying out water 
jetting, the required number of steel pipes of 40 to 50 mm diameter shall be embedded in the 
steining of the well, spaced evenly around its periphery. The bottom of the steel pipe shall 
taper down to a nozzle exiting in the sloping face of the well curb. The diameter of the nozzle 



======================================================================
PAGE 504 of 903
======================================================================
Well Foundations
Section 1200
485
shall be 6 mm. The steel pipe shall be kept about 1m above the top of each lift of steining, so 
that it can be extended by means of suitable couplers before the next lift of steining is cast. 
When the well reaches the hard strata and the need for water jetting arises, the tops of the 
embedded pipes shall be connected to pumps of required capacity for pumping in water at 
high pressure. The water jet issuing from the nozzle of the pipe under high pressure, cuts 
through the hard material and loosens it, permitting the well to sink at a faster rate than would 
otherwise have been possible. When water jetting is to be adopted, the Contractor shall 
furnish a method statement for approval of the Engineer covering all aspects of the work 
including the number, capacity and location of the high pressure pumps and other ancillaries 
required for executing the work.
1208.5	
Use of Jack Down Method
The jack down method of sinking shall be adopted as per requirement or as directed by the 
Engineer. The first step shall be to install ground anchors outside the periphery of the well. 
The number, location and depth of ground anchors are decided based on the properties of 
the surrounding soil to develop the necessary resisting force through skin friction. The drill 
holes of about 150 mm diameter along with casings shall be taken down to a depth of about 
20 m or more below the founding level of the well, depending on requirements of design. After 
the holes have been drilled to the required depth, prestressing strands of adequate diameter 
and capacity are cut to the desired length and lowered into the holes. The holes shall then be 
grouted with cement slurry with non-shrink additive. Once the grouting is completed till the 
ground level, the casing is removed. The removal of the casing shall be done before the grout 
sets. In case rock is met with, the anchors shall be socketed into rock.
Heavy duty pressurization girders fabricated of steel, shall be placed over stools resting on 
the steining of the well, against which the hydraulic jacks connected to the ground anchors, 
can exert pressure to push the well down. The hydraulic jacks shall be of capacity 500 T 
or more as per requirement. Before applying pressure from the jacks, 1 m deep sump is 
created inside the well by dredging. Pressure on different jacks is exerted in such a manner 
as to neutralize any tendency of the well to tilt. With the use of the jacks and controlled 
dredging, high rates of sinking can be achieved and the chances of sand blowing can also 
be reduced.
For use of jack down method of sinking, the Contractor shall furnish a method statement for 
approval of the Engineer, giving full details of construction of ground anchors, fabrication 
of pressurizing girder, type, number and capacity of jacks to be used, method of dredging 
and application of jack down force and all other relevant aspects for proper execution of the 
work.
1208.6	
Use of Explosives
Mild explosive charges may be used as an aid for sinking of the well. All prevalent laws 



======================================================================
PAGE 505 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1200
Well Foundations
486
concerning handling, storing and using of explosives shall be strictly followed. All safety 
precautions shall be taken as per IS:4081 “Safety Code for Blasting and related Drilling 
Operations”, to the extent applicable, whenever blasting is resorted to.
When the likelihood of resorting to blasting is predicted in advance, protection of the bottom 
portion of the well shall be done as per Clause 1205.4.
Blasting of any sort shall be done only with prior permission and in the presence of the 
Engineer. Blasting shall not be done before the concrete in the steining has hardened 
sufficiently and is more than 7 days old.
After blasting operations are completed, the well curb and steining should be examined for 
any cracks and remedial measures taken if required.
If blasting has been done after the well has reached the design foundation level, normally 
24 hours shall be allowed to lapse before the bottom plug is laid.
The charges shall be exploded well below the cutting edge by making a sump so as to avoid 
chances of any damage to the curb or to the steining of the well. A minimum sump of 1 m 
depth should be made before resorting to blasting. Use of large charges, 0.7 kg or above, 
may not be allowed, except under expert direction and with the permission of the Engineer. 
The pattern of charges may be suitably arranged with delay detonators so as to reduce the 
number of charges fired at a time. The burden of the charge may be limited to 1 m and the 
spacing of holes may normally be kept as 0.5 m to 0.6 m.
There should be no equipment inside the well nor shall there be any worker in the close 
vicinity of the well at the time of exploding the charges.
If rock blasting is to be done for seating of the well, the damage caused by flying debris should 
be minimised by covering blasting holes with rubber mats before detonating the charge.
1208.7	
Use of Divers
Divers may be used for removal of obstructions during sinking, carrying out rock blasting and 
for inspection. All safety precautions shall be taken as per any acceptable safety code or any 
statutory regulations in force, when divers carry out work under water in the well.
Only persons trained in diving operations shall be employed after being certified fit for diving 
by an approved doctor. They shall work under expert supervision. The raising of the diver 
from the bottom of wells shall be controlled so that decompression rate conforms to the rate 
as laid down in relevant regulations.
The diving and other equipment shall be of acceptable standard and certified to this effect 
by an approved independent agency. They shall be well maintained as per requirements for 
safe use.

Locks shall be located so that the lowest part of the bottom door shall not be less than
1 m above the highest water level in the well.
The supply of fresh air to the working chamber shall at all times be sufficient to permit work 
to be done without any danger or excessive discomfort. All air supply lines shall be fitted with 
check valves.
A man lock shall be used solely for the compression or decompression of workers and not 
for the passage of plant and material and shall be maintained in a reasonably clean and 
sufficiently warm state. However, any hand tool or hand instruments used for the purpose of 
the work may be carried into the man lock.
Where it is not reasonably practicable to provide a separate man lock for use by workers 
only, the lock when it is in actual use for compression or decompression of a person, shall be 
in a reasonably clean and sufficiently warm state and shall not be put simultaneously to any 
other use.
1208.8.3	
Valves
Exhaust valves shall be provided, having risers extending to the upper part of the chamber. 
These shall be operated, whenever necessary specially after a blast. Precautions shall be 
taken that men are not allowed to resume work after a blast, until the gas and smoke have 
cleared.
1208.8.4 
Medical Supervision and Certification
Every employee absent from work for 10 or more consecutive days due to illness or any other 
disability, shall be required to pass the regular physical examination by the doctor before 
being permitted to return to work.
After a person has been employed continuously in compressed air for a period of 2 months, 
he shall be re-examined by the doctor and shall not be permitted to work until such re-
examination has been made and the report is satisfactory.
No person known to be addicted to the excessive use of intoxicants shall be permitted to 
work in compressed air.
The doctor shall, at all times, keep a complete and full record of examination made by 
him, which shall contain dates of examinations, a clear and full description of the persons 
examined, his age and physical condition at the time of examination and a statement as to 
the period for which he has been engaged in such work. Records shall be kept at the place 
where the work is in progress and shall be subject to inspection by authorized officers.

======================================================================
Well Foundations
Section 1200
489
Every man lock shall always have a doctor or a responsible person in attendance. In case the 
person in charge is not a doctor, he must have positive means of promptly communicating with 
and securing the services of a competent doctor in case of emergency. Such arrangements 
shall invariably be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
All cases of compressed-air illness shall be reported and copies of all such reports shall be 
kept in file at the place of work.
1208.8.5	
Lighting
All lighting in compressed air chambers shall be operated only by electricity. Two independent 
electric lighting systems with independent sources of supply shall be used. These shall be so 
arranged that the emergency source shall become automatically operative in case of failure 
of the regularly used source.
The minimum intensity of light on any walkway ladder, stairway, or lower working level shall 
be one-quarter (1/4) candlepower. In all work places, the lighting shall always be such as 
to enable workmen to see their way about clearly. All external parts of lighting fixtures and 
electrical equipment lying within 2.5 m above the floor shall be constructed of non-combustible, 
non-absorbing insulating materials. If metal is used, it must be effectively earthed. Portable 
lamp shall have non-combustible, non-absorbing insulating sockets, approved handles, 
basket guards and approved cables. The use of worn out or defective portable and pendant 
conductors is prohibited.
1208.8.6	
Safety Against Fire Hazard
No oil, gasoline, or other combustible material shall be stored within 30 m of any shaft, 
caisson or tunnel opening. It shall be positively ensured that leaking flammable liquids do 
not flow into such areas. Oil may be stored in suitable tanks in isolated fireproof buildings, 
which are not less than 15 m away from any shaft, caisson, or tunnel opening or any building 
directly connected thereto.
Where feasible, a fire hose connected to a suitable source of water shall be provided at the 
top of every caisson. Where fire mains are not accessible, water shall be stored in tanks near 
the top of every caisson, provided fire pails or suitable pumps are kept available. Approved 
fire extinguishers shall also be provided.
1208.8.7	
Sanitation
Properly heated, lighted and ventilated dressing rooms shall be provided for all employees 
engaged in compressed air work. Such rooms shall contain lockers and benches and be open 
and accessible to person during intermissions between shifts. Adequate toilet accommodation 
of one for every twenty five employees shall be provided.

Section 1200
Well Foundations
490
Care shall be taken to keep all parts of the caissons and other working compartments, including 
locker rooms, dry rooms, rest rooms and other equipment in good sanitary condition and free 
from refuse, decaying or other objectionable matter.
Smoking shall be strictly prohibited and matches and smoking materials shall not be allowed 
to be brought into the locker rooms.
A separate dry room shall be provided where working clothes may be dried in a reasonable 
time.
1208.8.8	
Protection Against Gases
In all cases where release of gas is expected as in the case of sinking through alluvium 
impregnated with decayed vegetable matter, the use of Davy Safety Lamp shall be 
compulsory.
1208.8.9	
Additional Safety Provisions
	
a)	
The weight of the pneumatic platform and that of steining and kentlege, 
if any, shall be sufficient to resist the uplift from air inside, skin friction 
being neglected in this case. If at any section, the total weight acting 
downwards is less than the uplift pressure of air inside, additional 
kentledge shall be placed on the well.
	
	
If it is not possible to make the well heavy enough during excavation, 
“blowing down” may be used. The men should be withdrawn and air 
pressure reduced. The well should then begin to move with small 
reduction in air pressure. “Blowing down” should only be used when 
the ground is such that it will not heave up inside the chamber when the 
pressure is reduced. When the well does not move with the reduction 
in air pressure, kentledge should be added. “Blowing down” should be 
in short stages and the drop should not exceed, 0.5 m at any stage. To 
control sinking during blowing down, use of packing is recommended.
	
b)	
The pneumatic sinking plant and other allied machinery shall not only 
be of proper design and make, but also shall be operated by competent 
and well trained personnel. Every part of the machinery and its fixtures 
shall be minutely examined before installation and use. Availability of 
appropriate spares, standbys, safety of personnel as recommended in 
IS:4138 for working in compressed air must be ensured at site. Codes 
for safety and for working in compressed air and other labour laws and 
practices prevalent in the country, as specified to provide safe, efficient 
and expeditious sinking shall be followed.

Section 1200
491
	
c)	
Inflammable materials shall not be taken into air locks and smoking 
shall be prohibited. Wherever gases are suspected to be issuing out 
of dredge hole, the same shall be analysed by trained personnel and 
necessary precautions adopted to avoid hazard to life and equipment.
	
d)	
Where blasting is resorted to, it shall be carefully controlled and all 
required precautions shall be observed. Workers shall be allowed 
inside after blasting only when a competent and qualified person has 
examined the chamber and steining thoroughly and found the same to 
be safe.
1208.9	
Precautions During Sinking
	
a)	
When wells have to be sunk close to each other and clear distance 
between them is less than the diameter of wells, sinking shall be taken 
up on all wells and they shall be sunk alternately so that the sinking 
proceeds uniformly. Simultaneous and even dredging shall be carried 
out in the wells in such a manner that the difference in the levels of 
the sump and cutting edge in the adjacent wells does not exceed half 
the clear gap between them. Plugging of all the wells shall be done 
together.
	
b)	
During sinking of double D-shaped wells, the excavation in both the 
dredge holes should be carried out simultaneously and equally.
	
c)	
Bore chart shall be referred to constantly during sinking for taking 
adequate care while piercing different types of strata. The type of soil 
as obtained during the well sinking should be compared with bore chart 
so as to take prompt decisions.
	
d)	
Before seasonal floods, all wells on which sinking is in progress shall 
be sunk to sufficient depths below the designed scour level. Further, 
they shall be temporarily filled and plugged so that they do not suffer 
any tilt or shift during the floods.
	
e)	
All necessary precautions shall be taken against any possible damage 
to the foundations of existing structures in the vicinity of the wells, prior 
to commencement of dredging from inside the well.
	
f)	
The dredged material shall not be allowed to accumulate around the 
well. It shall be dumped and spread, as far away as possible, and then 
continuously and simultaneously removed, as directed by the Engineer. 
In case the river stream flows along one edge of the well being sunk, 
the dredged material shall not be dumped on the dry side of the bank 
but on the side on which the river current flows.
	
g)	
Very deep sump shall not be made below the well curb, as it entails 
risk of jumping (sudden sinking) of the well. The depth of sump shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 511 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1200
Well Foundations
492
be generally limited to one-sixth of the outer diameter/least lateral 
dimension of the well in plan. Normally the depth of sump shall not 
exceed 3.0 m below the level of the cutting edge unless otherwise 
specially permitted by the Engineer.
	
h)	
In case a well sinks suddenly with a jerk, the steining of the well shall 
be examined to the satisfaction of the Engineer to see that no damage 
has occurred to it.
	
i)	
In pneumatic sinking, the well shall not, at any time, be dropped to a 
depth greater than 500 mm by the method of “blowing down”.
	
j)	
Dewatering shall be avoided if sand blows are expected. Any equipment 
and men working inside the well shall be brought out of the well as soon 
as there are any indications of a sand-blow.
	
k)	
Sand blowing in wells can often be minimized by keeping the level of 
water inside the well higher than the water table and also by adding 
heavy kentledge.
	
l)	
In soft strata prone to settlement/creep, the construction of the abutment 
wells shall be taken up only after the approach embankment for a 
sufficient distance near the abutment, has been completed.
1208.10	
Tilts and Shifts
Unless otherwise specified, the tilt of any well i.e. its inclination from the vertical, shall not 
exceed 1 (horizontal) in 80 (vertical). The shift of the well i.e. the horizontal displacement of 
the centre of the well at the founding level from its theoretical position, shall not be more than 
150 mm in any resultant direction.
Tilts and shifts shall be carefully checked and recorded regularly during sinking operations 
in the format given in Appendix 1200/II. For the purpose of measuring the tilts along the two 
axes of the bridge, reduced level of the marks painted on the surface of the steining of the 
well shall be taken. For determination of shift, locations of the ends of the two diameters shall 
be precisely measured along the two axes, with reference to fixed reference points.
Whenever any tilt is noticed, adequate corrective measures like placing eccentric kentledge, 
pulling, strutting, anchoring or depositing more dredged material outside the tilted face, 
water/air jetting, shall be adopted before any further sinking. After correction, the dredged 
material shall be removed and disposed of sufficiently away from the affected well. In case of 
sinking by jack down method tilt can be controlled by suitably adjusting jack down pressure 
on one side.
A pair of wells close to each other have a tendency to come closer while sinking. Timber 
struts may be introduced in between the steining of these wells to prevent such movement.



======================================================================
PAGE 512 of 903
======================================================================
Well Foundations
Section 1200
493
Tilts occurring in a well during sinking in dipping rocky strata can be controlled by suitably 
supporting the curb.
In the event of a well developing tilt or shift beyond the specified permissible values, the 
Contractor shall have to carry out, at his own cost, suitable remedial measures to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer, to bring the tilt and shift within permissible values.
If the resultant tilt and shift of any well exceeds 1 in 80 or 150 mm respectively the well so 
sunk shall be regarded as not conforming to specification and classified as substandard 
work. The Engineer in his sole discretion, may consider accepting such a well, provided:
	
i)	
Calculations for foundation pressures and steining stresses, accounting 
for the actual tilt and shift furnished by the Contractor show that the 
well is safe. remedial measures required to bring the stresses within 
permissible values (such as increase in the dimension of the well cap, 
provision of dummy weights on the well cap etc.), shall be carried out 
by the Contractor at his own cost.
	
ii)	
The Contractor shall be subjected to reduction in rates as a penalty in 
accordance with Clause 1215(g).
In case the Engineer, in his discretion, rejects the well, the Contractor shall dismantle the 
rejected well to the extent directed by the Engineer and remove the debris. Further, the 
Contractor shall at his own risk and cost, complete the bridge with modified span arrangement 
acceptable to the Engineer.
1208.11	
Seating of Wells
The well shall be uniformly seated on the founding strata. It shall be ensured by test borings 
that the properties of the soil encountered at the founding level and up to a depth of one and 
a half times the well diameter, is identical to that adopted in the design. The procedure for 
test boring shall be in accordance with the provisions of these Specifications. In case the 
soil encountered is inferior to that adopted in design, the well shall be re-designed by the 
Engineer adopting the soil properties actually encountered and the founding level intimated 
to the Contractor, who shall carry out the work accordingly.
In case of seating of wells in hard rocky strata, where the rock profile is steeply sloping, 
pneumatic methods of sinking may be adopted to seat the well evenly as directed by the 
Engineer. The decision of adopting pneumatic sinking shall be taken by the Engineer. The 
cutting edge may also be embedded for a suitable depth in the rocky strata, as decided by 
the Engineer keeping in view the quality of rock. A sump of depth 300 mm in hard rock or 
600 mm in ordinary rock shall be made inside the well by chiselling or blasting as approved 
by Engineer. Diameter of sump shall be 1.5 m to 2 m less than that of the dredge hole. After 



======================================================================
PAGE 513 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1200
Well Foundations
494
the well has been evenly seated on good hard rock, arrangements shall be made to facilitate 
proper inspection in dry and visible conditions before the bottom plug is laid.
1209	
BOTTOM  PLUG
A bottom plug of concrete shall be provided in all wells, the top level of which shall be kept 
a minimum of 300 mm above the top of the curb, as shown in IRC:78. A suitable sump shall 
be made below the level of the cutting edge. Before concreting the bottom plug, it shall be 
ensured that the inside faces of curb and steining have been cleaned thoroughly.
The concrete mix used in bottom plug shall have a minimum cement content of 330 kg per 
cu.m with a slump about 150 mm, to permit easy flow of concrete through tremie to fill up all 
cavities. Concrete shall be laid in one continuous operation till the dredge hole is filled to the 
required height. For under water concreting, the concrete shall be placed by tremie under still 
water condition and the minimum cement content shall not be less than 330 kg/m3 inclusive 
of all mineral admixtures, if added.
In case of grouted concrete, the grout mix shall not be leaner than 1:2. It shall be ensured 
that the grout fills up all interstices upto the top of the bottom plug by suitable means such as, 
controlling the rate of pumping etc.
Any dewatering required, shall only be done 7 days after casting of bottom plug.
The concrete production and placement equipment should be sufficient to enable under 
water concreting within stipulated time. Necessary standby equipment should be available 
for emergency situation.
Before commencing plugging, all loose material from the bottom of the well shall be removed. 
Concreting shall be done in one continuous operation till the dredge hole is filled up to the 
required height and thereafter soundings shall be taken to ensure that the concrete has been 
laid to the required height. Least disturbance shall be caused to the water inside the well 
while laying concrete in the bottom plug. The concrete after placing, shall not be disturbed in 
any way for at least 7 days.
In order to check whether there is any rise in the level of the bottom plug, soundings should 
be taken at the close of concreting and once every day for the next 3 days.
The soundness of the bottom plug may be tested by dewatering the well to a level 5 m 
below the surrounding water level and checking the rise of water. For foundation subjected to 
artesian pressure, the depth of dewatering by 5 m shall be measured form the still water level 
created inside the well by the construction of false steining. The rate of rise shall preferably be 
less than 10 cm per hour. In case the rate is higher, suitable remedial measures as directed 
by the Engineer, shall be taken by the Contractor at his own cost.

A reinforced cement concrete well cap will be provided over the top of the steining in 
accordance with the drawing. Formwork will be prepared conforming to the shape of well 
cap. In case sand filling has been carried out up to the top of the well, the concrete of the well 
cap may be laid directly on it after it has been suitably levelled. Otherwise, suitable shuttering 
supported on the inside of the steining, shall be provided for carrying the weight of the green 
concrete of the well cap.
Concreting shall be carried out in dry condition. A properly designed false steining may be 
provided where required, to ensure that the well cap is laid in dry condition.
The bottom of the well cap shall be laid preferably as low as possible but above the LWL in 
the active channel. Where the bed level is higher than the LWL, the top of the well cap may 
be suitably raised and kept 1m below existing ground level.
Bond rods of steining shall be anchored into the well cap.
1213	
TOLERANCES
The permissible tilt and shift shall not exceed 1 (horizontal) in 80 (vertical) and the shift at the

DESCRIPTION
This work shall consist of construction of structures with bricks jointed together by cement 
mortar, in accordance with the details shown on the drawings or as approved by the 
Engineer.
1302	
MATERIALS
All materials to be used in the work shall conform to the requirements laid down in 
Section 1000 of these specifications.
1303	
PERSONNEL
Construction of brick work shall be carried out only by masons having sufficient experience/ 
training in the work.
1304	
CEMENT  MORTAR
1304.1	
Proportioning and Mixing of Mortar
Cement and sand shall be mixed in specified proportions given on the drawings. Cement 
shall be proportioned by weight, taking the unit weight of cement as 1.44 tonne per cubic 
metre. Sand shall be proportioned by volume with due allowance for bulking. All mortar shall 
be mixed with a minimum quantity of water to produce desired workability consistent with 
required density. The mix shall be clean and free from soil, acid, alkali, organic matter or 
other deleterious substances.
The mixing shall be done in a mechanical mixer operated manually or by power. As an 
exception, hand mixing can also be resorted to as long as uniform density of the mix and its 
strength are assured. Hand mixing shall be permitted only for very small and isolated works 
like CD works, subject to the prior approval of the Engineer. Hand mixing shall be carried 
out on a clean watertight platform, where cement and sand shall be first mixed dry in the 
required proportion by being turned over and over, backwards and forwards, several times 
till the mixture is of uniform colour. Thereafter, minimum quantity of water shall be added to 
bring the mortar to the consistency of a stiff paste. The mortar shall be mixed for at least two 
minutes after addition of water.
Mortar shall be mixed only in such quantity as required for immediate use. The mix which 
has developed initial set shall not be used. Initial set of mortar with ordinary Portland Cement 
shall normally be considered to have taken place in 30 minutes after mixing. In case the 
mortar has stiffened during initial setting time because of evaporation of water, it can be 
re-tempered by adding water as frequently as needed to restore the requisite consistency, but 
such re-tempering shall not be permitted 30 minutes after mixing. Mortar remaining unused 
for more than 30 minutes after mixing, shall be rejected and removed from site of work.

Testing of Mortar
Necessary tests to determine compressive strength of the mortar, its consistency and water 
resistivity shall be carried out in accordance with IS:2250. For compressive strength tests, 
the frequency of testing shall be 1 cube for every 2 cu.m of mortar, subject to a minimum of 
3 cubes for a day’s work.
1305	
SOAKING  OF  BRICKS
All bricks shall be thoroughly soaked in a tank filled with water for a minimum period of one 
hour prior to being laid. Soaked bricks shall be removed from the tank sufficiently in advance 
so that they are skin dry at the time of actual laying. Such soaked bricks shall be stacked at 
a clean place where they are not contaminated with dirt, earth, etc.
1306	
JOINTS
The thickness of joints shall not exceed 10 mm. All joints on exposed faces shall be tooled 
to give concave finish.
1307	
LAYING
All brickwork shall be laid in an English bond, even and true to line, plumb and level and all 
joints accurately kept in accordance with the drawing or as directed by the Engineer. Half and 
cut bricks shall not be used except when necessary to complete the bond. Closer in such 
cases shall be cut to the required size and used near the ends of the walls. The bricks used 
at the face and also at all angles forming the junction of any two walls shall be selected whole 
bricks of uniform size, with true and rectangular faces.
All bricks shall be laid with frogs up on a full bed of mortar except in the case of tile bricks. 
Each brick shall be properly bedded and set in position by slightly pressing while laying, so 
that the mortar gets into all its surface pores to ensure proper adhesion. All head and side 
joints shall be completely filled by applying sufficient mortar to brick already placed and on 
brick to be placed. All joints shall be properly flushed and packed with mortar so that no 
hollow spaces are left. No bats or cut bricks shall be used except to obtain dimensions of the 
different courses for specified bonds or wherever a desired shape so requires.
The brick work shall be built in uniform layers and for this purpose, wooden straight edge 
with graduations indicating thickness of each course including joint shall be used. Corners 
and other advanced work shall be raked back. Brickwork shall be done true to plumb or in 
specified batter. All courses shall be laid truly horizontal, and vertical joints shall be truly 
vertical. Vertical joints in alternate courses shall come directly one over the other. During 
construction, no part of work shall rise more than one metre above the general construction 
level, to avoid unequal settlement and improper jointing. Where this is not possible, the work 
shall be raked back according to the bond (and not toothed) at an angle not steeper than 
45 degree with prior approval of the Engineer. Toothing may also be permitted where future 
extension is contemplated.

Before laying bricks in foundation, the foundation slab shall be thoroughly hacked, swept 
clean and wetted. A layer of mortar not less than 12 mm thick shall be spread on the surface 
of the foundation slab before the first course of bricks is laid.
1308	
JOINTING  OLD  AND  NEW  WORK
Where fresh masonry is to join with masonry that is partially/entirely set, the exposed jointing 
surface of the set masonry shall be cleaned, roughened and wetted, so as to achieve the 
best possible bond with the new work. All loose bricks and mortar or other material shall be 
removed.
In the case of vertical or inclined joints, it shall be further ensured that proper bond between 
the old and new masonry is obtained by interlocking the bricks. Any portion of the brickwork 
that has been completed, shall remain undisturbed until thoroughly set.
In case of sharp corners specially in skew bridges, a flat cutback of 100 mm shall be provided 
so as to have proper and bonded laying of bricks.
1309	
CURING
Green work shall be protected from rain by suitable covering and shall be kept constantly 
moist on all faces for a minimum period of seven days. Brick work carried out during the day 
shall be suitably marked indicating the date on which the work was done, so as to keep a 
watch on the curing period. The top of the masonry work shall be left flooded with water at 
the close of the day. Watering shall be done carefully so as not to disturb or wash out the 
green mortar.
During hot weather, all finished or partly completed work shall be covered or wetted in such 
a manner as to prevent rapid drying of the brickwork.
During the period of curing, the brick work shall be suitably protected from all damages. At 
the close of day’s work or for other period of cessation, watering and curing shall have to be 
maintained. Should the mortar perish i.e. become dry, white or powdery through neglect of 
curing, work shall be pulled down to the extent required and rebuilt as directed by the Engineer. 
If any stains appear during watering, the same shall be removed from the surface.
1310	
SCAFFOLDING
The scaffolding shall be sound, strong and safe to withstand all loads likely to come upon it. 
The holes which provide resting space for horizontal members shall not be left in masonry 
under one metre in width or immediately near the skew backs of arches. The holes left in the 
masonry work for supporting the scaffolding shall be filled and made good. Scaffolding shall 
be got approved by the Engineer, but its safety shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.

General
All brickwork shall be finished in a workmanlike manner with the thickness of joints, manner 
of striking or tooling as described in these specifications.
The surfaces can be finished by jointing, pointing or plastering, as shown on the drawings.
For a surface which is to be subsequently plastered or pointed, the joints shall be squarely 
raked out to a depth of 15 mm, while the mortar is still green. The raked joints shall be well 
brushed to remove dust and loose particles and the surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and 
wetted.
The mortar for finishing shall be prepared as per Clause 1304.
1312.2	
Jointing
In jointing, the face of the mortar shall be worked out while still green to give a finished 
surface flush with the face of the brick work. The faces of brick work shall be cleaned to 
remove any splashes of mortar during the course of raising the brick work.
1312.3	
Pointing
Pointing shall be carried out using mortar not leaner than 1:3 by volume of cement and sand 
or as shown on the drawing. The mortar shall be filled and pressed into the raked joints 
before giving the required finish. The pointing shall be ruled type for which it shall, while still 
green, be ruled along the centre with half round tools of such width as may be specified by 
the Engineer. The superfluous mortar shall then be taken off from the edges of the lines and 
the surface of the masonry shall be cleaned of all mortar. The work shall conform to IS:2212. 
Raised pointing which projects beyond the face of stone, brick or block shall be avoided.
1312.4	
Plastering
Plastering shall be done where shown on the drawing. Superficial plastering may be done, 
if necessary, only in structures situated in fast flowing rivers or in severely aggressive 
environment.
Plastering shall be started from top and worked down. All holes shall be properly filled in 
advance of the plastering, while the scaffolding is being taken down. Wooden screeds 
75 mm wide and of the thickness of the plaster shall be fixed vertically 2.5 m to 4 m apart,

to act as gauges and guides in applying the plaster. The mortar shall be laid on the wall 
between the screeds using the plasterer’s float and pressing the mortar so that the raked 
joints are properly filled. The plaster shall then be finished off with a wooden straight edge 
reaching across the screeds. The straight edge shall be worked on the screeds with a small 
upward and sideways motion 50 mm to 75 mm at a time. Finally, the surface shall be finished 
off with a plasterer’s wooden float. Metal floats shall not be used.
When re-commencing plastering beyond the work suspended earlier, the edges of the 
old plaster shall be scraped, cleaned and wetted before plaster is applied to the adjacent 
areas.
No portion of the surface shall be left unfinished for patching up at a later period.
The plaster shall be finished true to plumb surface and to the proper degree of smoothness 
as directed by the Engineer.
The average thickness of plaster shall not be less than that specified. The minimum thickness 
over any portion of the surface shall not be less than the specified thickness by more than 
3 mm.
Any cracks which appear in the surface and all portions which sound hollow when tapped, 
or are found to be soft or otherwise defective, shall be cut in rectangular shape and re-done 
as directed by the Engineer.
1312.5	
Curing of Finishes
Curing shall be commenced as soon as the mortar used for finishing has hardened sufficiently 
so as not to be damaged during curing. The curing shall be done for a period of at least 
7 days, during which the finishing shall be suitably protected from all damages.
1312.6	
Scaffolding for Finishes
Stage scaffolding independent of the structure, shall be provided for the work of finishing.
1313	
COPING  FOR  WING/RETURN/PARAPET  WALL

1405.1.1	
General
The dressing of stone shall be as specified for individual type masonry work and it shall 
also conform to the general requirements of IS:1597 and requirement for dressing of stone 
covered in IS:1129. Other specific requirements are covered separately with respect to 
particular types of rubble stone work.
1405.1.2	
Laying
1405.1.2.1	
The masonry work shall be laid to lines, levels, curves and shapes as shown 
on the drawing. The height in each course shall be kept same and every stone shall be fine 
tooled on all beds, joints and faces, full and true. The exposed faces shall be gouged out, 
grooved, regulated and sunk or plain moulded as the case may be. The faces of each stone 
between the draft shall be left rough as the stone comes from the quarry, except where 
sacrificial layer is to be provided or plastering is resorted to in aggressive environment.
1405.1.2.2	
Stones shall be sufficiently wetted before laying to prevent absorption of 
water from mortar.
Stratified stones shall be laid on their natural beds. All bed joints shall be normal to the 
direction of pressure coming on them.

Stones in the hearting shall be laid on their broadest faces so as to give better facility to fill 
the spaces between them.
The courses of the masonry shall ordinarily be pre-determined. They shall generally be of the 
same height. When there is to be variation in the height of courses, the larger courses are to be 
placed at lower levels, heights of courses decreasing gradually towards the top of the wall. The 
height of course shall not be less than 160 mm. placing loose mortar on the course and pouring 
water on it to fill the gaps in stones is not acceptable. Mortar shall be mixed thoroughly and 
poured in the joints in fluid state. No dry or hollow space shall be left anywhere in the masonry 
and each stone shall have all the embedded faces completely covered with mortar.
In tapered walls, the beds of the stones and the planes of course should be at right angles to 
the batter. In case of bridge piers with batter on both sides, the course shall be horizontal.
The bed which is to receive the stone, shall be cleaned, wetted and covered with a layer of 
fresh mortar. All stones shall be laid full in mortar both in bed and vertical joints and settled 
carefully in place with a wooden mallet immediately on placement and solidly embedded 
in mortar before it has set. Clean chips and spalls shall be wedged into the mortar joints 
and bed wherever necessary to avoid thick beds or joints of mortar. When the foundation 
masonry is laid directly on rock, the face stones of the first course shall be dressed to fit into 
rock snugly, when pressed down in the mortar bedding over the rock. No dry or hollow space 
shall be left anywhere in the masonry and each stone shall have all the embedded faces 
completely covered with mortar. For masonry works over rock, a levelling course of 150 mm 
thick M15 concrete, shall be laid over rock and then stone masonry work shall be laid without 
foundation concrete block.
Face works and hearting shall be brought up evenly but the top of each course shall not be 
levelled by the use of flat chips.
For sharp corners specially in skew bridges, through stones shall be used in order to avoid 
spalling of corners.
In case any stone already set in mortar, is disturbed or the joints broken, it shall be taken out 
without disturbing the adjoining stones and joints. Dry mortar shall be thoroughly cleaned 
from the joints and stones and the stones reset in fresh mortar. When freshly laid, no attempt 
shall be made to slide one stone on top of another.
Shaping and dressing shall be done before the stone is laid in the work. No dressing or 
hammering, which will loosen the masonry, will be allowed after the stone is placed in position. 
All necessary chases for joggles, dowels and clamps, should be formed beforehand.
Sufficient transverse bonds shall be provided by the use of bond stone extending from the 
front to the back of the wall and in case of thick wall, from outside to the interior and vice 
versa. In the latter case, bond stones shall overlap each other in their arrangement.
In case headers are not available, precast headers of M15 concrete shall be used. Cast in-
situ headers are not permitted.

Section 1400
511
Stones shall break joint on the face for at least half the height of the course and the bond 
shall be carefully maintained throughout.
In band work at all angle junctions of walls, the stones at each alternate course shall be 
carried into each of the respective walls so as to unite the work thoroughly.
Building up thin faces tied with occasional through stones and filling up the middle with small 
broken stones or even dry packing, is not acceptable.
All quoins and the angles of the opening shall be made from selected stones, carefully 
squared and bedded and arranged to bond alternately long and short in both directions.
All vertical joints shall be truly vertical. Vertical joints shall be staggered as far as possible. 
Distance between the vertical joints of upper layer and lower layer, shall not be less than half 
the height of the course.
Only rectangular shaped bond stones or headers shall be used. Bond stones shall overlap 
each other by 150 mm or more.
All connected masonry in a structure shall be carried up nearly at one uniform level throughout 
but when breaks are unavoidable, the masonry shall be raked in sufficiently long steps 
to facilitate jointing of old and new work. The stepping of raking shall not be more than 
45 degree with the horizontal.
1405.1.3	
Random Rubble Masonry (Uncoursed and Coursed)
1405.1.3.1	
Dressing
The stone shall be hammer dressed on the face, the sides and beds to enable it to come in 
proximity with the neighbouring stone. The bushing on the exposed face shall not be more 
than 40 mm.
1405.1.3.2	
Insertion of Chips
Chips and spalls of stone may be used wherever necessary to avoid thick mortar beds or 
joints and it shall be ensured that no hollow spaces are left anywhere in the masonry. The 
chips shall not be used below hearting stones to bring these upto the level of face stones. 
Use of chips shall be restricted to filling of interstices between the adjacent stones in hearting 
and they shall not exceed 20 percent of the quantity of stone masonry.
1405.1.3.3	
Hearting Stones
The hearting or interior filling of the wall face shall consist of rubble stones not less than 150 
mm long in any direction, carefully laid, hammered down with a wooden mallet into position and 
solidly bedded in mortar. The hearting should be laid nearly level with facing and backing.

of masonry above 600 mm thickness, a set of two or more bond stones overlapping 
each other at least by 150 mm shall be provided in a line from face to back. In case of 
highly absorbent types of stones (porous limestone and sandstones, etc.,) the bond 
stone shall extend only about two-thirds into the wall, as through stones in such 
cases may give rise to penetration of dampness and therefore, for all thicknesses of 
such masonry, a set of two or more bond stones overlapping each other by at least
150 mm shall be provided. One bond stone or a set of bond stones shall be provided for ever 
0.50 sq.m of the masonry surface.
1405.1.3.5	
Quoin Stone
Quoin stone specially selected and neatly dressed for forming an external angle in masonry 
work, shall not be less than 0.03 Cu.m in volume.
1405.1.3.6	
Plum Stone
The plum stones are selected long stones embedded vertically in the interior of the masonry to 
form a bond between successive courses and shall be provided at about 900 mm intervals.
1405.1.3.7	
Laying
The masonry shall be laid with or without courses as specified. The quoins shall be laid 
header and stretcher alternately. Every stone shall be fitted to the adjacent stone so as to 
form neat and close joint. Face stone shall extend and bond well in the back. These shall be 
arranged to break joints, as much as possible, and to avoid long vertical lines of joints.
1405.1.3.8	
Joints
The face joints shall not be more than 20 mm thick, but shall be sufficiently thick to prevent 
stone-to-stone contact and shall be completely filled with mortar.

These shall be square on all joints and beds. The bed joints shall be chisel drafted for at least 
80 mm back from the face and for at least 40 mm for the side joints. No portion of the dressed 
surface shall show a depth of gap more than 6 mm from the straight edge placed on it. The 
remaining unexposed portion of the stone shall not project beyond the surface of bed and side 
joints. The requirements regarding bushing shall be the same as for random rubble masonry.
1405.1.4.2	
Hearting Stones
The hearting or interior filling of the wall face shall consist of flat bedded stone carefully laid, 
on prepared beds in mortar. The use of chips shall be restricted to the filling of interstices 
between the adjacent stones in hearting and these shall not exceed 10 percent of the quantity

masonry, but these, shall be provided at 1.5 to 1.8 metre apart clear in every course.
1405.1.4.4	
Quoin Stone
The quoins shall be of the same height as the course in which they occur and shall be formed 
of header stones not less than 450 mm in length. They shall be laid lengthwise alternately 
along each face, square in their beds which shall be fairly dressed to a depth of a least 
100 mm.
1405.1.4.5	
Face Stone
Face stones shall tail into the work for not less than their heights and at least one-third of the 
stones shall tail into the work for a length not less than twice their height. These shall be laid 
as headers and stretchers alternately.
1405.1.4.6	
Laying
The stones shall be laid on horizontal courses and all vertical joints should be truly vertical. 
The quoin stones should be laid header and stretcher alternately and shall be laid square on 
their beds, which shall be rough chisel dressed to a depth of at least 100 mm.
1405.1.4.7	
Joints
The face joints shall not be more than 10 mm thick, but shall be sufficiently thick to prevent

Ashlar Masonry (Plain Ashlar)
1405.1.5.1	
Dressing
Every stone shall be cut to the required size and shape, chisel dressed on all beds and 
joints, so as to be free from all bushing. Dressed surface shall not show a depth of gap of 
more than 3 mm from straight edge placed on it. The exposed faces and joints, 6 mm from 
the face shall be fine tooled so that a straight edge can be laid along the face of the stone in 
contact with every point. All visible angles and edges shall be true and square and free from 
chippings. The corner stones (quoins) shall be dressed square and corner shall be straight 
and vertical.

Bond Stones
Through bond stones shall be provided for masonry up to 600 mm thickness and for masonry 
above 600 mm thickness, a set of two or more bond stones overlapping each other at least 
by 150 mm, shall be provided in a line from face to back. In case of highly absorbent types 
of stones (porous limestone and sandstones, etc.,) the bond stone shall extend only about 
two-thirds into the wall, as through stones in such cases may give rise to penetration of 
dampness. For masonry with such stones, a set of two or more bond stones overlapping 
each other by at least 150 mm shall be provided. One bond stone or a set of bond stones 
shall be 1.5 to 1.8 metre apart clear in every course.
1405.1.5.3	
Laying
The face stone shall be laid header and stretcher alternately, the header being arranged to 
come as nearly as possible in the middle of stretchers above and below. Stones shall be laid 
in regular courses not less than 300 mm in height and all courses of the same height, unless 
otherwise specified. No stone shall be less in width than its height or less in length than twice 
its height, unless otherwise specified.
1405.1.5.4	
Joints
All joints shall be full of mortar. These shall not be less than 3 mm thick. Face joints shall be 
uniform throughout, and a uniform recess of 20 mm depth from face shall be left with the help 
of a stone plate during the progress of work.
1405.2	
Concrete Block Masonry
1405.2.1	
Laying
The bed, which is to receive the block, shall be cleaned, wetted and covered with a layer of 
fresh mortar. The masonry works shall be laid to lines, levels, curves and shapes as shown 
on the drawing. In battered sections, the beds of blocks and the plane of courses shall be 
horizontal. Face blocks for such sections shall be manufactured specially for the purpose.
The block shall be soaked in water for at least 15 minutes before laying, to prevent absorption 
of water from mortar.
Concrete block masonry shall be constructed generally like fine tooled ashlar masonry. Each 
block must be fitted into its place dry in order that discrepancy of figure may be discovered 
and corrected before it is finally laid in mortar and settled in bed. The block shall be laid full in 
thin mortar, the bed and side joints being not more than 15 mm in thickness. Each block shall 
be struck with a wooden mallet when laid in place in mortar to bring it to solid bearing as to 
bed and joints. All visible edges shall be free from chippings.

The course shall be horizontal and side joints vertical throughout unless otherwise indicated 
in plans. Joints shall be struck.
For bond, face blocks shall be laid header and stretcher alternately unless otherwise ordered 
by the Engineer, the header being arranged to come as nearly as possible in the middle of 
stretchers below. The blocks in the courses above and below shall break joints for about half 
the height of the course and bond shall be carefully maintained throughout section.
While carrying out masonry work, templates prepared to the correct shape and approved 
by the Engineer, shall be used to ensure correct batter as well as correct shape of masonry, 
specially cut and ease water in piers. The finished work shall be checked at every stage by 
the competent authority to ensure that it has the correct shape and batter as required by 
design.
In case of skew bridges and for cut and ease water, the acute angle at the corners shall 
not be less than 45 degree. In case a smaller angle cannot be avoided, then a flat face of 
100 mm shall be provided.

Formwork
Section 1500
519
1501	
DESCRIPTION
Formwork shall include all temporary or permanent forms required for forming the concrete 
of the shape, dimensions and surface finish, as shown on the drawing or as directed by the 
Engineer, together with all props, staging, centering, scaffolding and temporary construction 
required for their support.
1502	
MATERIALS
All materials shall comply with the requirements of IRC:87. Materials and components used 
for formwork shall be examined for damage or excessive deterioration before use/re-use and 
shall be used only if found suitable after necessary repairs. In case of timber formwork, the 
inspection shall not only cover physical damages but also signs of attacks by decay, rot or 
insect attack or the development of splits.
Forms shall be constructed with metal or timber. The metal used for forms shall be of such 
thickness that the forms remain true to shape. All bolts should be countersunk. The use of 
approved internal steel ties or steel or plastic spacers shall be permitted. Structural steel 
tubes used as support for forms shall have a minimum wall thickness of 4 mm. Other materials 
conforming to the requirements of IRC:87 may also be used if approved by the Engineer.
1503	
DESIGN  OF  FORMWORK
1503.1	
The design, erection and removal of formwork shall conform to IRC:87 
“Guidelines for Formwork, Falsework and Temporary Structures” and these specifications. 
The forms shall be such as to ensure that they can be conveniently removed without disturbing 
the concrete. The design shall facilitate proper and safe access to all parts of formwork for 
inspection.
1503.2	
The Contractor shall furnish the design and drawing of complete formwork 
(i.e. the forms as well as their supports) for approval of the Engineer before any erection 
is taken up. If proprietary system of formwork is used, the Contractor shall furnish detailed 
information as per Appendix 1500/I, to the Engineer for approval.
Notwithstanding any approval or review of drawing and design by the Engineer, the Contractor 
shall be entirely responsible for the adequacy and safety of formwork.
1503.3	
In the case of prestressed concrete superstructure, careful consideration 
shall be given to redistribution of loads on props due to prestressing.
1504	
WORKMANSHIP
1504.1	
The formwork shall be robust and strong and the joints shall be leak-proof.
Ballies shall not be used as staging. Staging must have cross bracings and diagonal bracings 
in both directions. Staging shall be provided with an appropriately designed base plate resting 
on firm strata.



======================================================================
PAGE 539 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1500
Formwork
520
1504.2	
The number of joints in the formwork shall be kept to a minimum by using 
large sized panels. The design shall provide for proper “soldiers” to facilitate alignment. All 
joints shall be leak proof and must be properly sealed. Use of PVC joint sealing tapes, foam 
rubber or PVC T-section, is essential to prevent leakage of grout.
1504.3	
As far as practicable, clamps shall be used to hold the forms together. Where 
use of nails is unavoidable, minimum number of nails shall be used and these shall be of the 
double-headed type. Alternatively, if the nails are of the normal type, they shall be left partially 
projecting without being driven to their full length, so that they can be withdrawn easily.
1504.4	
Use of ties shall be restricted, as far as practicable. Wherever ties are used 
they shall be used with HDPE sheathing so that they can easily be removed. No parts prone 
to corrosion shall be left projecting or near the surface. The sheathing shall be grouted with 
cement mortar of the same strength as that of the structure.
1504.5	
Unless otherwise specified, or directed, chamfers or fillets of size 25 mm x 
25 mm shall be provided at all angles of the formwork to avoid sharp corners. The chamfers, 
beveled edges and mouldings shall be made in the formwork itself. Opening for fixtures and 
other fittings shall be provided in the shuttering as directed by the Engineer.
1504.6	
Shuttering for walls, sloping members and thin sections of considerable 
height shall be provided with temporary openings to permit inspection and cleaning out before 
placing of concrete.
1504.7	
The formwork shall be constructed with pre-camber to the soffit to allow for 
deflection of the formwork. This shall be in addition to the pre-camber for the permanent 
structure as shown on the drawings.
1504.8	
Where centering trusses or launching trusses are adopted for casting of 
superstructure, the joints of the centering trusses, whether welded, riveted or bolted shall be 
thoroughly checked periodically. Also, various members of the centering trusses should be 
periodically examined for proper alignment and unintended deformation before proceeding 
with the concreting. They shall also be periodically checked for any deterioration in quality 
due to steel corrosion. Launching truss, casting truss of span more than 40 m and travelling 
forms, shall be load tested before they are put to use.
1504.9	
The formwork shall be so made as to produce a finished concrete true to 
shape, line and levels and dimensions as shown on the drawings, subject to the tolerances 
specified in respective Sections of these specifications, or as directed by the Engineer.
1504.10	
Where metal forms are used, all bolts and rivets shall be countersunk and well 
ground to provide a smooth, plane surface. Where timber is used it shall be well seasoned, 
free from loose knots, projecting nails, splits or other defects that may mar the surface of 
concrete.
1504.11	
Forms shall be made sufficiently rigid by the use of ties and bracings to 
prevent any displacement or sagging between supports. They shall be strong enough to 
withstand all pressure, ramming and vibration during and after placing the concrete. Screw

======================================================================
Formwork
Section 1500
521
jacks or hard wood wedges where required shall be provided to make up any settlement in 
the formwork either before or during the placing of concrete.
1504.12	
The formwork shall ensure the correct final shape of the structure, with the 
calculated amount of positive or negative camber. The deformation of falsework, scaffolding 
or propping and the instantaneous or deferred deformation due to various causes arising in 
prestressed structures, shall be properly accounted for.
1504.13	
Suitable camber shall be provided to horizontal members of structure, 
specially in long spans, to counteract the effects of deflection. The formwork shall be so fixed 
as to provide for such camber.
1504.14	
The formwork shall be coated with an approved release agent that will 
effectively prevent sticking and will not stain the concrete surface. Lubricating oils (machine 
oils) shall be prohibited for use as coating.
1505	
LINING  OF  FORmWORK
The formwork shall be lined with material approved by the Engineer so as to provide a smooth 
finish of uniform texture and appearance. This material shall leave no stain on the concrete 
and shall be so fixed to its backing as not to impart any blemishes. It shall be of the same 
type and obtained from only one source throughout for the construction of any one structure. 
The contractor shall make good any imperfections in the resulting finish as required by the 
Engineer. Internal ties and embedded metal parts shall be carefully detailed and their use 
shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
1506	
PRECAUTIONS
The following precautions shall be observed:
	
i)	
It shall be ensured that any cut-outs or openings provided in any 
structural member to facilitate erection of formwork, are closed with 
the same grade of concrete as that of the structure, after formwork is 
removed.
	
ii)	
Provision for safe access to the formwork shall be made at all levels as 
required.
	
iii)	
Close watch shall be maintained to check for settlement of formwork 
during concreting and any settlement shall be promptly rectified.
	
iv)	
Natural ground shall be checked for bearing capacity and likely 
settlement before erection of the staging.
	
v)	
It shall be ensured that water used for curing or rain water does not 
stagnate near the base plate of the staging.
	
vi)	
For shutters used for deep and narrow member, temporary openings 
in the sides shall be provided to facilitate pouring and compaction of 
concrete.

1507	
PREPARATION  OF  FORMWORK  BEFORE  CONCRETING
The inside surfaces of forms shall, except in the case of permanent formwork or where 
otherwise agreed to by the Engineer, be coated with a release agent supplied by approved 
manufacturer or of an approved material to prevent adhesion of concrete to the formwork. 
Release agents shall be applied strictly in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and 
shall not be allowed to come in contact with any reinforcement or prestressing tendons and 
anchorages. Different release agents shall not be used in formwork for exposed concrete.
Before re-use of forms, the following actions shall be taken :
	
i)	
The contact surfaces of the forms shall be cleaned carefully and dried 
before applying a release agent.
	
ii)	
It should be ensured that the release agent is appropriate to the surface 
to be coated. The same type and make of release agent shall be used 
throughout on similar formwork materials and different types should not 
be mixed.
	
iii)	
The form surfaces shall be evenly and thinly coated with release agent. 
The vertical surface shall be treated before horizontal surface and any 
excess wiped out.
	
iv)	
It shall be ensured that the reinforcement or the surface of the hardened 
concrete shall not come in contact with the release agent.
All forms shall be thoroughly cleaned immediately before concreting.
The Contractor shall give the Engineer due notice before placing any concrete in the forms to 
permit him to inspect and approve the formwork. However, such inspection shall not relieve 
the contractor of his responsibility for safety of formwork, men, machinery, materials and 
finish or tolerances of concrete.
1508	
REMOVAL  OF  FORMWORK
The scheme for removal of formwork (i.e. de-shuttering and de-centering) shall be planned 
in advance and furnished to the Engineer for scrutiny and approval. No formwork or any part 
thereof shall be removed without prior approval of the Engineer.
The formwork shall be so removed as not to cause any damage to concrete. Centering 
shall be gradually and uniformly lowered in such a manner as to permit the concrete to take 
stresses due to its own weight uniformly and gradually to avoid any shock or vibration.
Form work shall not be released unless the concrete has achieved strength of at least twice 
the stress the concrete may be subjected at the time of the removal of formwork. When no

test is conducted for determination of strength of concrete and where the time of removal of 
formwork is not specified, the same shall be as under :
a)
Walls, piers, abutments, columns and vertical faces 
of structural members
12 to 48 hours as may be 
decided by the Engineer
b)
Soffits of Slabs (with props left under)
3 days
c)
Props left under slabs
14 days
d)
Soffits of Girders (with props left under)
7 days
e)
Props (left under girders)
21 days
The above time schedule is applicable when ordinary Portland Cement is used without any 
admixtures at an ambient temperature exceeding 10ºC.
For concrete made with Portland pozzolona cement, Portland slag cement or mineral 
admixtures, additional cube samples shall be taken for verifying the strength of concrete to 
decide the time of deshuttering.
Where there are re-entrant angles in the concrete sections, the formwork should be removed 
at these sections as soon as possible after the concrete has set, in order to avoid cracking 
due to shrinkage of concrete.
Additional precautions as given in Clause 8.17 of IRC: 87, shall also be followed.
1509	
RE-USE  OF  FORMWORK
When the formwork is dismantled, its individual components shall be examined for damage 
and damaged pieces shall be removed for rectification. Such examination shall always be 
carried out before their use again. Before re-use all components shall be cleaned of deposits 
of soil, concrete or other unwanted materials. Threaded parts shall be oiled after cleaning.
All bent steel props shall be straightened before re-use. The maximum permissible deviation 
from straightness is 1/600 of the length. The maximum permissible axial loads in used 
props shall be suitably reduced depending upon their condition. The condition of the timber 
components, plywood and steel shuttering plates shall be examined closely for distortion and 
defects before re-use.
1510	
SPECIALISED  FORMWORK
Specialised formwork such as slipform, floating caisson and travelling form, wherever used 
shall be designed and detailed by competent agencies and a set of complete working drawings 
and installation instructions supplied to the Engineer. In case proprietary equipment is used, 
the supplier shall furnish drawings, details, installation instructions etc, in the form of manuals 
along with the formwork.

1601	
DESCRIPTION
This work shall consist of furnishing and placing coated or uncoated mild steel or high 
strength deformed reinforcement bars of the shape and dimensions shown on the drawings 
and conforming to these Specifications or as approved by the Engineer.
1602	
GENERAL
Steel for reinforcement shall meet the requirements of Section 1000 of these 
Specifications.
Reinforcements may be either mild steel or high strength deformed bars. They may be 
uncoated or coated with epoxy.
1603	
PROTECTION  OF  REINFORCEMENT
Uncoated reinforcing steel shall be protected from rusting or chloride contamination. 
Reinforcements shall be free from rust, mortar, loose mill scale, grease, oil or paints. This 
may be ensured either by using reinforcement fresh from the factory or by thoroughly 
cleaning it using any suitable method such as sand blasting, mechanical wire brushing etc., 
as directed by the Engineer. Reinforcements shall be stored above the ground in a clean 
and dry condition, on blocks, racks or platforms and shall be suitably marked to facilitate 
inspection and identification.
Portions of uncoated reinforcing steel and dowels projecting from concrete, shall be protected 
within one week after initial placing of concrete, with a brush coat of neat cement mixed 
with water to a consistency of thick paint. This coating shall be removed by lightly tapping 
with a hammer or other tool not more than one week before placing of the adjacent pour of 
concrete. Coated reinforcing steel shall be protected against damage to the coating. If the 
coating on the bars is damaged during transportation or handling and cannot be repaired, the 
same shall be rejected.
In case of fusion bonded epoxy coated reinforcement or hot dipped galvanized bars used, 
reference shall be made Clause 1010.3.2 of Section 1000 of these specifications.
1604	
BENDING  OF  REINFORCEMENT
Bar bending schedule shall be furnished by the Contractor and got approved by the Engineer 
before start of work.
Reinforcing steel shall conform to the dimensions and shapes given in the approved Bar 
Bending Schedules.



======================================================================
PAGE 547 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1600
Steel Reinforcement
528
Bars shall be bent cold to the specified shape and dimensions or as directed by the Engineer 
using a proper bar bender, operated by hand or power to obtain the correct shape and radii 
of bends.
Bars shall not be bent or straightened in a manner that will damage the parent material or 
the coating.
Bars bent during transport or handling shall be straightened before being used on work. They 
shall not be heated to facilitate straightening.
1605	
PLACING  OF  REINFORCEMENT
	
a)	
The reinforcement cage should generally be fabricated in the yard at 
ground level and then shifted and placed in position. The reinforcement 
shall be placed strictly in accordance with the drawings and shall be 
assembled in position only when the structure is otherwise ready 
for placing of concrete. Prolonged time gap between assembling of 
reinforcement and casting of concrete, which may result in rust formation 
on the surface of the bars, shall not be permitted.
	
b)	
Reinforcement bars shall be placed accurately in position as shown 
on the drawings. The bars, crossing one another shall be tied together 
at every intersection with binding wire (annealed), conforming to 
IS:280 to make the skeleton of the reinforcement rigid such that the 
reinforcement does not get displaced during placing of concrete, or 
any other operation. The diameter of binding wire shall not be less than 
1 mm.
	
c)	
Bars shall be kept in position usually by the following methods:
	
i)	
In case of beam and slab construction, industrially produced 
polymer cover blocks of thickness equal to the specified cover, 
shall be placed between the bars and formwork, subject to 
satisfactory evidence that the polymer composition is not harmful 
to concrete and reinforcement. Cover blocks made of concrete 
may be permitted by the Engineer, provided they have the same 
strength and specification as those of the member.
	
ii)	
In case of dowels for columns and walls, the vertical reinforcement 
shall be kept in position by means of timber templates with slots cut 
in them accurately, or with cover blocks tied to the reinforcement. 
Timber templates shall be removed after the concreting has 
progressed upto a level just below their location.
	
iii)	
Layers of reinforcements shall be separated by spacer bars at 
approximately one metre intervals. The minimum diameter of 



======================================================================

Steel Reinforcement
Section 1600
529
spacer bars shall be 12 mm or equal to maximum size of main 
reinforcement or maximum size of coarse aggregate, whichever 
is greater. Horizontal reinforcement shall not be allowed to sag 
between supports.
	
iv)	
Necessary stays, blocks, metal chairs, spacers, metal hangers, 
supporting wires etc. or other subsidiary reinforcement shall be 
provided to fix the reinforcement firmly in its correct position.
	
v)	
Use of pebbles, broken stone, metal pipe, brick, mortar or wooden 
blocks etc., as devices for positioning reinforcement shall not be 
permitted.
	
d)	
Bars coated with epoxy shall be placed on supports that do not damage 
the coating. Supports shall be installed in a manner such that planes of 
weakness are not created in hardened concrete. The coated reinforcing 
steel shall be held in place by use of plastic or plastic coated binding 
wires especially manufactured for the purpose. Refer Section 1000 of 
these Specifications for other requirements.
	
e)	
Placing and fixing of reinforcement shall be inspected and approved by 
the Engineer before concreting is commenced.
1606	
BAR  SPLICES
1606.1	
Lapping
All reinforcement shall be furnished in full lengths as indicated on the drawing. No splicing 
of bars, except where shown on the drawing, shall be permitted without approval of the 
Engineer. The lengths of the splice shall be as indicated on drawing or as approved by the 
Engineer. Where practicable, overlapping bars shall not touch each other, and shall be kept 
apart by 25 mm or 1.25 times the maximum size of coarse aggregate, whichever is greater. If 
this is not feasible, overlapping bars shall be bound with annealed steel binding wire not less 
than 1 mm diameter and twisted tight in such a manner as to maintain minimum clear cover 
to the reinforcement from the concrete surface. Lapped splices shall be staggered or located 
at points along the span where stresses are low.
1606.2	
Welding
1606.2.1	
Splicing by welding of reinforcement will be permitted only if detailed on the 
drawing or approved by the Engineer. Weld shall develop an ultimate strength equal to or 
greater than that of the bars connected.
1606.2.2	
While welding may be permitted for mild steel reinforcing bars conforming 
to IS:432, welding of deformed bars conforming to IS:1786 shall in general be prohibited. 
Welding may be permitted in case of bars of other than Fe 240 grade including special

1606.2.3	
The method of welding shall conform to IS:2751 and IS:9417, any 
supplemental specifications and Clause 1904.8 of these Specifications to the satisfaction of 
the Engineer.
Welding may be carried out by metal arc welding process. Oxy-acetelene welding shall not 
be permissible. Any other process may be used subject to the approval of the Engineer and 
necessary additional requirements to ensure satisfactory joint performance. Precautions on 
overheating, choice of electrode, selection of correct current in arc welding etc., should be 
strictly observed.
All bars shall be butt welded except for smaller diameter bars (diameter of less than 
20 mm) which may be lap welded. Single-V or Double-V butt joints may generally be used. 
For vertical bars single bevel or double bevel joints may be used.
Welded joints shall be located well away from bends and shall be not less than twice the bar 
diameter away from a bend.
Generally, shop welding in controlled conditions is to be preferred, where feasible. Site 
welding where necessary shall, however, be permitted when the facilities, equipment, 
process, consumables, operators and welding procedure, are adequate to produce and 
maintain uniform quality at par with that attainable in shop welding, to the satisfaction of the 
Engineer.
Joint welding procedures which are to be employed shall invariably be established by a 
procedure specification. All welders and welding operators to be employed shall be qualified 
by tests prescribed in IS:2751. Inspection of welds shall conform to IS:822 and destructive or 
non-destructive testing may be undertaken when deemed necessary. Joints with weld defects 
detected by visual inspection or dimensional check inspection, shall not be accepted.
Suitable means shall be provided for holding the bars securely in position during welding. 
It must be ensured that no voids are left in welding. When welding is done in two or three 
stages, the surface shall be cleaned properly after each stage. Bars shall be cleaned of all 
loose scale, rust, grease, paint and other foreign matter before carrying out welding. Only 
competent and experienced welders shall be employed on the work with the approval of the 
Engineer. No welding shall be done on coated bars.
M.S. electrodes used for welding shall conform to IS:814.

2)	
Standard concrete is made on the basis of design mix proportioned 
by weight of its ingredients, which in addition to cement, aggregates 
and water, may contain chemical admixtures to achieve certain target 
values of various properties in fresh condition, achievement of which is 
monitored and controlled during production by suitable tests. Generally, 
concrete of grades up to M50 are included in this type.
	
3)	
High Performance Concrete is similar to standard concrete but 
contains additional one or more mineral admixtures providing binding 
characteristics and partly acting as inert filler material which increases 
its strength, reduces its porosity and modifies its other properties in 
fresh as well as hardened condition. Concrete of grades upto M90 are 
included in this type.
	
4)	
For concrete of grades higher than M90, the design parameters may be 
obtained from specialized literature and experimental results.
1703.2	
The minimum grades of concrete and corresponding minimum cement 
content and maximum water/cement ratios for different exposure conditions shall be as 
indicated in Table 1700-2.
1703.3	
For concrete subjected to sulphate attack the minimum grades of concrete, 
minimum cement content and maximum water/cement ratios and types of cement for different 
concentration of sulphate content shall be as indicated in Table 1700-3.

are more stringent than those given in this table, then the former will govern.
OPC: Ordinary Portland Cement, PPC: Portland Pozzolona Cement. PSC: Portland Slag 
Cement, SRPC: Sulphate Resisting Portland Cement.
The minimum cement content shall be as low as possible but not less than the quantities 
specified in Table 1700-2 and 1700-3.
The maximum cement content excluding any mineral admixtures (Portland cement component 
alone) shall not exceed 450 kg/cu.m.
1703.4	
Concrete used in any component or structure shall be specified by designation 
along with prescribed method of design of mix i.e. ‘Design Mix’ or ‘Nominal Mix’. For all items 
of concrete, only design mix shall be used, except where nominal mix concrete is permitted 
as per drawing or by the Engineer. Nominal mix may be permitted only for minor bridges and 
culverts or other incidental construction, where strength requirements are upto M 20 only. 
Nominal mix may also be permitted for non-structural concrete or for screed below open 
foundations.
1703.5	
If the Contractor so proposes, the Engineer may permit the use of concrete 
of higher grade than that specified on the drawing, provided the higher grade concrete meets 
the specifications applicable. The additional cost of such higher grade concrete shall be 
borne by the Contractor.

PROPORTIONING  OF  CONCRETE
Prior to the start of construction, the Contractor shall design the mix in case of design mix 
concrete or propose nominal mix in case of nominal mix concrete, and submit to the Engineer 
for approval, the proportions of materials, including admixtures to be used. Water-reducing 
admixtures (including plasticisers or super-plasticisers) may be used at the Contractor’s 
option, subject to the approval of the Engineer.
1704.1	
Requirements of Consistency
The mix shall have the consistency which will allow proper placement and compaction in the 
required position. Every attempt shall be made to obtain uniform consistency. Slump test 
shall be used to measure consistency of the concrete.
The optimum consistency for various types of structures shall be as indicated in Table 1700-4, 
or as directed by the Engineer. The slump of concrete shall be checked as per IS:516.

2)
RCC structure with widely spaced reinforcements; e.g. 
solid columns, piers, abutments, footings, well steining

3)
RCC structure with fair degree of congestion of 
reinforcement; e.g. pier and abutment caps, box culverts, 
well curb, well cap, walls with thickness greater than 
300 mm
50 – 75
4)
RCC and PSC structure with highly congested 
reinforcements e.g. deck slab girders, box girders, walls 
with thickness less than 300 mm
75 – 125
5)
Underwater concreting through tremie e.g. bottom plug, 
cast in-situ piling
150 – 200 
Notwithstanding the optimum consistency indicated against Sl. No. 1 to 3, the situation should 
be property assessed to arrive at the desired workability with the adjustment of admixture in 
each case, where the concrete is to be transported through transit mixer and placed using 
concrete pump. Under these circumstances, the optimum consistency during placement for 
the items of work of Sl. No. 1 to 3, can be considered ranging from 75 mm to 150 mm. This 
is, however, subject to satisfying the other essential criteria of strength, durability etc. and 
approval of the Engineer.

1704.2.2	
Trial Mixes
The Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer to enable him to be present at the time of 
carrying out trial mixes and preliminary testing of the cubes. Prior to commencement of trial 
mix design, all materials forming constituents of proposed design mix should have been 
tested and approval obtained in writing from the Engineer. Based on test results of material, 
draft mix design calculation for all grades of concrete to be used in the works, shall be 
prepared after taking into account the provisions in the Contract Technical Specifications, 
Guidelines of IS:10262, IS:SP:23 and IRC:112 and submitted to the Engineer for approval. 
Prior to commencement of concreting, trial mix design shall be performed for all grades of 
concrete and trial mix which has been found successful, shall be submitted by the Contractor 
and approval obtained. During concreting with the approved trial mix design, if source of any 
constituents is changed, the mix design shall be revised and tested for satisfying the strength 
requirements.
The initial trial mixes shall be carried out in a laboratory approved by the Engineer. However, 
Engineer may permit the initial trial mixes to be prepared at the site laboratory of the Contractor, 
if a full fledged concrete laboratory has been established well before the start of construction, 
to his entire satisfaction. Sampling and testing procedures shall be in accordance with these 
Specifications.
When the site laboratory is utilized for preparing initial mix design, the concrete production 
plant and means of transport employed to make the trial mixes shall be similar to those 
proposed to be used in the works.
For each trial mix, a set of six cubes shall be made from each of three consecutive batches 
for purposes of testing. Three cubes from each set of six shall be tested at an age of 
28 days and three at an earlier age approved by the Engineer. The cubes shall be made, 
cured, stored, transported and tested in accordance with these Specifications. The mean 
strength of the nine cubes at 28 days shall exceed the specified characteristic strength by the 
current margin minus 3.5 MPa.
1704.2.3	
Control of Strength of Design Mixes
	
a)	
Adjustment to Mix Proportions
	
	
Adjustment to mix proportions arrived at in the trial mixes, shall be made 
subject to the Engineer’s approval, in order to minimize the variability of 
strength and to maintain the target mean strength. Such adjustments 
shall not be taken to imply any change in the current margin.
	
b)	
Change of Current Margin
	
	
When required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall recalculate the 
current margin in accordance with Clause 1704.2.1. The recalculated 



======================================================================
PAGE 560 of 903
======================================================================

value shall be adopted as directed by the Engineer, and it shall become 
the current margin for concrete produced thereafter.
	
c)	
Additional Trial Mixes
	
	
In case any changes are observed in the properties of fresh concrete 
and/or strength of hardened concrete on the basis of early age tests, 
additional mixes and tests shall be carried out during production, so as 
to control and bring the quality of concrete within acceptable limits. In 
case of any change in the source or properties of materials, the design 
of mix shall be established afresh.

b)	
The total water soluble sulphate content of the concrete mix expressed 
as SO3, shall not exceed 4 percent by mass of cement in the mix.
For concrete made with Portland pozzolona cement, Portland blast furnace slag cement or 
mineral admixtures, the setting time and rate of gain of strength are different from those for 
concrete made with OPC alone. Such modified properties shall be taken into account while 
deciding the de-shuttering time, curing period, early age loading and time of prestressing. 
Additional cube samples may be required to be taken for verifying the concrete properties.
1704.5	
Suitability of Proposed Mix Proportions
The Contractor shall submit the following information for the Engineer’s approval :
	
a)	
Nature and source of each material
	
b)	
Quantities of each material per cubic metre of fully compacted 
concrete
	
c)	
Either of the following :
	
i)	
Appropriate existing data as evidence of satisfactory previous 
performance for the target mean strength, current margin, 
consistency and water/cement ratio and any other additional 
requirement (s) as specified.
	
ii)	
full details of tests on trial mixes.
	
d)	
Statement giving the proposed mix proportions for nominal mix 
concrete
Any change in the source of material or in the mix proportions shall be subject to the 
Engineer’s prior approval.
1704.6	
Checking of Mix Proportions and Water/Cement Ratio
In proportioning concrete, the quantity of both cement and aggregate shall be determined 
by weight. Where the weight of cement per bag as given by the manufacturer is accepted, 
a reasonable number of bags shall be weighed separately to check the net weight. Where 
cement is weighed from bulk stock at site and not by bag, it shall be weighed separately from 
the aggregates. Water shall either be measured by volume in calibrated tanks or weighed. 
All measuring equipment shall be maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. Their 
accuracy shall be periodically checked.
The specified water/cement ratio shall always be kept constant and at its correct value. To this 
end, moisture content in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be determined as frequently 
as possible, the frequency for a given job being determined by the Engineer according to the 
weather conditions. The amount of water to be added shall then be adjusted to compensate 



======================================================================
PAGE 562 of 903
======================================================================
Structural Concrete
Section 1700
543
for variations in the moisture content. For the determination of moisture content in the 
aggregates IS:2386 (Part III) shall be referred. Suitable adjustments shall also be made in 
the weight of aggregates to allow for their variation in weight due to variation in their moisture 
content.
1704.7	
Grading of Aggregates for Pumped Concrete
Materials for pumped concrete shall be batched consistently and uniformly. Maximum size of 
aggregate shall not exceed one-third of the internal diameter of the pipe.
The grading of aggregates shall be continuous and shall have sufficient ultra fine materials 
(material finer than 0.25 mm). Proportion of fine aggregates passing through 0.25 mm shall be 
between 15 and 30 percent and that passing through 0.125 mm sieve shall not be less than 
5 percent of the total volume of aggregate. Admixtures to increase workability can be added. 
When pumping long distances and in hot weather, set-retarding admixtures can be used. 
Fluid mixes can be pumped satisfactorily after adding plasticisers and super plaslicisers. 
Suitability of concrete shall be verified by trial mixes and by performing pumping test.
1705	
ADMIXTURES
1705.1	
Chemical Admixtures
Chemical admixtures such as superplasticisers, or air entraining, water reducing, accelerating 
and retarding agents for concrete, may be used with the approval of the Engineer.
As the selection of an appropriate concrete admixture is an integral part of the mix design, 
the manufacturers shall recommend the use of any one of their products only after obtaining 
complete information of all the actual constituents of concrete as well as methodologies of 
manufacture, transportation and compaction of concrete proposed to be used in the work. 
Admixtures/additives conforming to IS:9103 may be used subject to approval of the Engineer. 
However, admixtures/additives generating hydrogen or nitrogen and containing chlorides, 
nitrates, sulphides, sulphates or any other material likely to adversely affect the steel or 
concrete, shall not be permitted.
The general requirements for admixtures are given in Clause 1007 of these Specifications.
Compatibility of the admixtures with the cement and any other pozzolona or hydraulic addition 
shall be ensured by for avoiding the following problems
	
i)	
Requirement of large dosage of superplasticiser for achieving the 
desired workability,
	
ii)	
Excessive retardation of setting,

BATCHING,  MIXING,  TRANSPORTING,  PLACING  AND  COMPACTION
1708.1	
General
Prior to start of concreting, the Contractor shall submit for approval of the Engineer, his 
programme along with list of equipment proposed to be used by him for batching, mixing, 
transporting and placing concrete.
1708.2	
Batching of Concrete
In batching concrete:
	
●	
The quantity of cement, aggregate and mineral admixtures, if used, 
shall be determined by mass.
	
●	
Chemical admixtures, if solid, shall be determined by mass.
	
●	
Liquid admixtures may be measured in volume or mass, and
	
●	
Water shall be weighed or measured by volume in a calibrated tank.
The concrete shall be sourced from on-site or off-site batching and mixing plants, or from 
approved Ready Mixed Concrete plants, preferably having quality certification.
Except where supply of properly graded aggregate of uniform quality can be maintained 
over a period of work, the grading of aggregate should be controlled by obtaining the coarse 
aggregate in different sizes and blending them in the right proportions when required, the 
different sizes being stocked in separate stock piles. The materials should be stock piled 
several hours, preferably a day before use. The grading of coarse and fine aggregate should 
be checked as frequently as possible to ensure that the specified grading is maintained.
The water/cement ratio shall always be maintained constant at its correct value. To this end, 
determination of moisture content in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as 
frequently as possible, depending on weather conditions. The amount of added water shall 
be adjusted to compensate for any observed variations in the moisture content. To allow for 
the variation in mass of aggregate due to variation in moisture content, suitable adjustment 
in the mass of aggregate, shall also be made. Accurate control shall be kept on the quantity 
of mixing water, which when specified, shall not be changed without approval.

1708.3	
Mixing Concrete
1708.3.1	
Mixing at Site
All concrete shall be machine mixed. In order to ensure uniformity and good quality of concrete 
the ingredients shall be mixed in a power driven batch mixer with hopper and suitable weigh 
batching arrangement or in a central mix plant. Hand mixing shall not be permitted. The mixer 
or the plant shall be at an approved location considering the properties of the mixes and the 
transportation arrangements available with the Contractor. The mixer or the plant shall be 
approved by the Engineer.
Mixing shall be continued till materials are uniformly distributed, a uniform colour of the 
entire mass is obtained and each individual particle of the coarse aggregate shows complete 
coating of mortar containing its proportionate amount of cement. In no case shall mixing be 
done for less than 2 minutes. It shall be ensured that the mixers are not loaded above their 
rated capacities and are operated at a speed recommended by the manufacturer. When 
mineral admixtures are added at the mixing stage, their thorough and uniform blending with 
cement shall be ensured, if necessary by longer mixing time. The addition of water after the 
completion of the initial mixing operation, shall not be permitted.
Mixers which have been out of use for more than 30 minutes shall be thoroughly cleaned 
before putting in a new batch and also before changing from one type of cement to another.
1708.3.2	
Ready Mix Concrete
Use of ready mix concrete proportioned and mixed off the project site and delivered to site 
in a freshly mixed and unhardened state conforming to IS:4926, shall be allowed with the 
approval of the Engineer.
1708.4	
Transporting Concrete
Mixed concrete shall be transported from the place of mixing to the place of final deposit as 
rapidly as possible by methods which will prevent the segregation or loss of the ingredients. 
The method of transporting or placing of concrete shall be approved by the Engineer. 
Concrete shall be transported and placed as near as practicable to its final position so that 
no contamination, segregation or loss of its constituents materials take place.
Concrete may be transported by transit mixers or properly designed buckets or by pumping. 
Transit mixers or other hauling equipment when used should be equipped with the means 
of discharge of concrete without segregation. During hot or cold weather, concrete shall be 
transported in deep containers. Other suitable methods to be reduce the loss of water by 
evaporation in hot weather and heat loss in cold weather may also be adopted.



======================================================================
PAGE 567 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1700
Structural Concrete
548
When concrete is conveyed by chute, the plant shall be of such size and design as to ensure 
practically continuous flow. Slope of the chute shall be so adjusted that the concrete flows 
without excessive quantity of water and without any segregation of its ingredients. The 
delivery end of the chute shall be as close as possible to the point of deposit. The chute shall 
be thoroughly flushed with water before and after each working period and the water used for 
this purpose shall be discharged outside the formwork.
In case concrete is to be transported by pumping, the fresh concrete should have adequate 
fluidity and cohesiveness to be pumpable. Proper concrete mix proportioning and initial trials 
should ensure this. The conduit shall be primed by pumping a batch of mortar through the line 
to lubricate it. Once the pumping is started, it shall not be interrupted, as concrete standing 
idle in the line is liable to cause plug. The operator shall ensure that some concrete is always 
there in the pump’s receiving hopper during operation. The lines shall always be maintained 
clean and free of dents.
Pipelines from the pump to the placing area shall be laid with minimum bends. For large 
quantity placements, standby pumps shall be available. Suitable air release valves, shutoff 
valves etc. shall be provided as per site requirements. The pumping of priming mix i.e. rich 
mix of creamy consistency, to lubricate the concrete pump and pipelines, shall precede 
the pumping of concrete. Continuous pumping shall be done to the extent possible. After 
concreting, the pipelines and accessories shall be cleaned immediately. The pipes for 
pumping shall not be made of material which has adverse effect on concrete. Aluminium 
alloy pipelines shall not be used.
1708.5	
Placing of Concrete
All formwork and reinforcement contained in it shall be cleaned and made free from standing 
water, dust, snow or ice immediately before placing of concrete.
No concrete shall be placed in any part of the structure until the approval of the Engineer 
has been obtained. If concreting is not started within 24 hours of the approval being given, 
the approval shall have to be obtained again from the Engineer. Concreting shall proceed 
continuously over the area between the construction joints. Fresh concrete shall not be 
placed against concrete which has been in position for more than 30 minutes, unless a 
proper construction joint is formed.
The concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable in its original position to avoid re-
handling. Methods of placing should be such as to preclude segregation. Care should be 
taken to avoid displacement of reinforcement or movement of formwork. To achieve this, 
concrete should be lowered vertically in the form and horizontal movement of concrete inside 
the forms should, as far as practicable, be minimised.



======================================================================
PAGE 568 of 903
======================================================================
Structural Concrete
Section 1700
549
The concrete shall be placed and compacted before its initial setting so that it is amenable to 
compaction by vibration. The workability of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate 
for the compaction equipment to be used. If there is considerable time gap between mixing 
and placing of concrete, as in the case of ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and 
mixing plants, concrete mix shall be designed to have appropriately higher workability at the 
time of discharge from the mixer, in order to compensate the loss of workability during transit. 
This is generally achieved by suitable chemical admixtures. Keeping these considerations in 
view, the general requirement for ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing 
plants, is that concrete shall be discharged from the truck mixer within two hours of the time 
of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable retarding admixtures are used.
In wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should preferably be used to lower 
concrete to the bottom of the form. As a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete 
may not exceed 1.5 metres and under no circumstances shall it be more than 2 metres. 
When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete having adequate fluidity, 
cohesiveness and viscosity and which uniformly and completely fills every corner of the 
formwork by its own weight without segregation, shall be used.
Except where otherwise agreed to by the Engineer, concrete shall be deposited in horizontal 
layers to a compacted depth of not more than 450 mm when internal vibrators are used and 
not more than 300 mm in all other cases.
Concrete when deposited shall have temperature of not less than 5ºC and preferably not 
more than 30ºC and in no case more than 40ºC. In case of site mixing, fresh concrete shall 
be placed and compacted in its final position within 30 minutes of its discharge from the 
mixer. When the concrete is carried in properly designed agitator operating continuously, the 
concrete shall be placed and compacted within 1 hour of the addition of cement to the mix 
and within 30 minutes of its discharge from the agitator. It may be necessary to add retarding 
admixtures to concrete, if trials show that the periods indicated above are unacceptable. In 
all such matters, the Engineer’s decision shall be final.
1708.6	
Compaction of Concrete
Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted by vibration or other means during placing and 
worked around the reinforcement, tendons or duct formers, embedded fixtures and into 
corners of the formwork to produce a dense homogeneous void-free mass having the 
required surface finish. When vibrators are used, vibration shall be done continuously during 
the placing of each batch of concrete until the expulsion of air has practically ceased and in 
a manner that does not promote segregation. Over-vibration shall be avoided to minimize 
the risk of forming a weak surface layer. When external vibrators are used, the design of 
formwork and disposition of vibrator shall be such as to ensure efficient compaction and to 
avoid surface blemishes. Vibrations shall not be applied through reinforcement and where 



======================================================================
PAGE 569 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1700
Structural Concrete
550
vibrators of immersion type are used, contact with reinforcement and all inserts like ducts 
etc., shall be avoided.
When internal vibrators are used, they shall be inserted vertically to the full depth of the layer 
being placed and ordinarily shall penetrate the layer below for a few centimetres. The vibrator 
should be kept in place until air bubbles cease escaping from the surface and then withdrawn 
slowly to ensure that no hole is left in the concrete, care being taken to see that it remains 
in continued operation while being withdrawn. The internal vibrators shall be inserted in an 
orderly manner and the distance between insertions should be about one and half times the 
radius of the area visibly affected by vibration. Additional vibrators in serviceable condition 
shall be kept at site so that they can be used in the event of breakdown.
Mechanical vibrators used shall comply with IS:2502, IS:2506, IS:2514 and IS:4656.
1709	
CONSTRUCTION  JOINTS
Construction joints shall be avoided as far as possible. In no case shall the locations of such 
joints be changed or increased from those shown on the drawings except with the express 
approval of the Engineer.
Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and concreting. 
Construction joints should be positioned to minimize the effects of the discontinuity of the 
durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure. As far as possible, joints should 
be provided in non-aggressive zones, but if joints in aggressive zones cannot be avoided, 
they should be sealed. Joints should be located away from the regions of maximum stress 
caused by loading; particularly where shear and bond stresses are high.
In beams and slabs joints should not be near the supports. Construction joints between slabs 
and ribs in composite beams, shall be avoided. For box girders, there shall be no construction 
joint between the soffit and webs.
Joints should be either vertical or horizontal. For a vertical construction joint, the lifts of 
concrete shall finish level or at right angles to the axis of the member. Concreting shall be 
continued right up to the joint.
Before resuming work at a construction joint when concrete has not yet fully hardened, all 
laitance shall be removed thoroughly. The surface shall be roughened, taking care to avoid 
dislodgement of coarse aggregates. Concrete shall be brushed with a stiff brush soon after 
casting, while the concrete has only slightly stiffened. If the concrete has partially hardened, 
it may be treated by wire brushing or with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying with 
an air jet, immediately before the new concrete is placed. Fully hardened concrete shall be 
treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack aggregate 
particles. The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout when concreting joints, shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 570 of 903
======================================================================
Structural Concrete
Section 1700
551
be avoided. The old surface shall be soaked with water, without leaving puddles, immediately 
before starting concreting. The new concrete shall be thoroughly compacted against it.
Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement 
shall be protected. In all cases, where construction joints are made, the joint surface shall not 
be contaminated with release agents, dust, or sprayed curing membrane and reinforcement 
shall be firmly fixed in position at the correct cover.
The sequence of concreting, striking of forms and positioning of construction joints for every 
individual structure, shall be decided well in advance of the commencement of work.
1710	
CONCRETING  UNDER  WATER
When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods, equipment, materials 
and proportions of mix to be used, shall be got approved from the Engineer before any work 
is started.
Concrete shall not be placed in water having a temperature below 5ºC. The temperature of 
the concrete, when deposited, shall not be less than 16ºC, nor more than 30ºC.
Coffer dams or forms shall be sufficiently tight to ensure still water conditions, if practicable, 
and in any case to reduce the flow of water to less than 3 m per minute through the space 
into which concrete is to be deposited. Coffer dams or forms in still water shall be sufficiently 
tight to prevent loss of mortar through the joints in the walls. Pumping shall not be done 
while concrete is being placed, or until 24 hours thereafter. To minimise the formation of 
laitance, care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete as far as possible while it is being 
deposited.
All under water concreting shall be carried out by tremie method only. The number and 
spacing of the tremies should be worked out to ensure proper concreting. However, it is 
necessary to have a minimum number of 2 tremies for any concreting operation, so that even 
if one of the tremies goes out of commission during concreting, the other one can be used to 
complete the work. The tremie concreting when started, should continue without interruption 
for the full height of the member being concreted. The capacity of the concrete production 
and placement equipment should be sufficient to enable the underwater concreting to be 
completed uninterrupted within the stipulated time.
The top section of the tremie shall have a hopper large enough to hold one full batch of the 
mix or the entire contents of the transporting bucket, as the case may be. The tremie pipe 
shall not be less than 200 mm in diameter and shall be large enough to allow a free flow 
of concrete and strong enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it 
is suspended, even if a partial vacuum develops inside the pipe. Preferably, flanged steel 
pipe of adequate strength shall be used. A separate lifting device shall be provided for each 



======================================================================
PAGE 571 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1700
Structural Concrete
552
tremie pipe with its hopper at the upper end. Unless the lower end of the pipe is equipped 
with an approved automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall be plugged with a 
wadding of gunny sacking or other approved material before delivering the concrete to the 
tremie pipe through the hopper, so that when the concrete is forced down from the hopper to 
the pipe, it will force the plug (and along with it any water in the pipe) down the pipe and out 
of the bottom end, thus establishing a continuous stream of concrete. It will be necessary to 
raise the tremie slowly in order to allow a uniform flow of concrete. At all times after placing 
of concrete is started and until all the required quantity has been placed, the lower end of the 
tremie pipe shall be kept below the surface of the plastic concrete and shall not be taken out 
of concrete. This will cause the concrete to build up from below instead of flowing out over 
the surface and thus avoid formation of layers of laitance. It is advisable to use retarders or 
suitable superplasticizers to retard the setting time of concrete, which shall be established 
before the commencement of work.
1711	
CONCRETING  IN  EXTREME  WEATHER
1711.1	
Concreting in Cold Weather
Where concrete is to be deposited at or near freezing temperature, precautions shall be 
taken to ensure that at the time of placing, it has a temperature of not less than 5ºC and 
that the temperature shall be maintained above 4ºC until the concrete has hardened. When 
necessary, concrete ingredients shall be heated before mixing but cement shall not be heated 
artificially other than by the heat transmitted to it from other ingredients of the concrete. Stock-
piled aggregate may be heated by the use of dry heat or steam. Aggregates shall not be 
heated directly by gas or on sheet metal over fire. In general, the temperature of aggregates 
or water shall not exceed 65ºC. Salt or other chemicals shall not be used for the prevention of 
freezing. No frozen material or materials containing ice shall be used. All concrete damaged 
by frost shall be removed. Concrete exposed to freezing weather shall have entrained air and 
the water content of the mix shall not exceed 30 litres per 50 kg of cement. To counter slower 
setting of concrete, accelerators can be used with the approval of the Engineer. However, 
accelerators containing chloride shall not be used.
1711.2	
Concreting in Hot Weather
When depositing concrete in hot weather, precautions shall be taken so that the temperature 
of wet concrete does not exceed 30ºC while placing. This shall be achieved by using chilled 
mixing water, using crushed ice as a part of mixing water, shading stock piles of aggregates 
from direct rays of the sun, sprinkling the stock piles of coarse aggregate with water to keep 
them moist, limiting temperature of cement below 30ºC at the time of use, starting curing 
before concrete dries out and restricting time of concreting as far as possible to early mornings 
and late evenings. When ice is used to cool mixing water, it will be considered as part of 
the water in design mix. Under no circumstances shall the mixing operation be considered 
complete until all ice in the mixing drum has melted. The Contractor will be required to state 



======================================================================
PAGE 572 of 903
======================================================================
Structural Concrete
Section 1700
553
his methodology for the Engineer’s approval when temperatures of concrete are likely to 
exceed 30ºC during the work.
1712	
PROTECTION  AND  CURING
1712.1	
General
Concreting operations shall not commence until adequate arrangements for concrete curing 
have been made by the Contractor. Curing and protection of concrete shall start immediately 
after compaction of the concrete.
The concrete shall be protected from:
	
a)	
Premature drying out particularly by solar radiation and wind
	
b)	
High internal thermal gradients
	
c)	
Leaching out by rain and flowing water
	
d)	
Rapid cooling during the first few days after placing
	
e)	
Low temperature or frost
	
f)	
Vibration and impact which may disrupt the concrete and interfere with 
its bond to the reinforcement.
	
g)	
Vibration caused by traffic including construction traffic.
Concrete shall be protected, without allowing ingress of external water, by means of wet 
(not dripping) gunny bags, hessian etc. Once the concrete has attained some degree of 
hardening (approximate 12 hrs after mixing), moist curing shall commence and be continued 
through the requisite period. Where members are of considerable size and length, with high 
cement content, accelerated curing methods may be applied, as approved by the Engineer.
1712.2	
Water Curing
Water for curing shall be as specified in Section 1000 of these specifications.
Sea water shall not be used for curing. Sea water shall not come into contact with concrete 
members before they have attained adequate strength.
The concrete should be kept constantly wet by ponding or covering or use of sprinklers/ 
perforated pipes for a minimum period of 14 days after concreting, except in the case of 
concrete with rapid hardening cement, where it can be reduced to 5 days. Water should be 
applied on surfaces after the final set. Curing through watering shall not be done on green 
concrete. On formed surfaces, curing shall start immediately after the forms are stripped. 
The concrete shall be kept constantly wet with a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian or similar 
absorbent material.



======================================================================
PAGE 573 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1700
Structural Concrete
554
1712.3	
Steam Curing
Where steam curing is adopted, it shall be ensured that it is done in suitable enclosure to 
contain the live steam in order to minimize moisture and heat losses. The initial application 
of the steam shall be after about four hours of placement of concrete to allow the initial set 
of the concrete to take place.
Where retarders are used, the waiting period before application of the steam shall be increased 
to about six hours.
The steam shall be at 100 percent relative humidity to prevent loss of moisture and to provide 
excess moisture for proper hydration of the cement. The application of steam shall not be 
directly on the concrete. Steam curing is applied in enclosures or tunnels through which 
concrete members are transported on a conveying system. Alternatively, portable enclosures 
or plastic covers are placed over precast members and steam is supplied to the enclosures. 
The rate of increase or decrease of temperature should not be more than 10ºC to 20ºC per 
hour and the maximum temperature shall be about 70ºC. The maximum temperature shall be 
maintained until the concrete has attained the desired strength required at the end of steam 
curing period and shall be decided by prior trials. When steam curing is discontinued, the air 
temperature shall not drop at a rate exceeding 10ºC per hour, until a temperature of about 
10ºC above the ambient temperature outside has been reached. Steam curing of concrete 
shall be followed by water curing for at least 7 days. The concrete shall not be exposed to 
temperatures below freezing for at least six days after curing.
1712.4	
Curing Compound
Membrane forming curing compounds consisting of waxes, resins, chlorinated rubbers etc. 
may be permitted by the Engineer in special circumstances. Curing compounds shall not 
be used on any surface which requires further finishing to be applied. All construction joints 
shall be moist cured and no curing compound shall be permitted in locations where concrete 
surfaces are required to be bonded together.
Liquid membrane forming compounds shall conform to ASTMC 309 and the curing efficiency 
shall be as per ASTMC 156.
Curing compounds shall be continuously agitated during use. All concrete cured by this 
method shall receive two applications of the curing compound. The first coat shall be applied 
immediately after acceptance of concrete finish. If the surface is dry, the concrete shall be 
saturated with water and curing compound applied as soon as the surface film of water 
disappears. The second application shall be made after the first application has set. Placement 
in more than two coats may be required to prevent streaking. The membrane formed shall 
be stripped off after 14 days, when curing is complete. Impermeable membranes, such as 
sheet materials for curing concrete conforming to ASTM C 171 or polyethylene sheeting 



======================================================================

555
covering closely the concrete surface, may also be used to provide effective barrier against 
evaporation.
1713	
FINISHING
Immediately after the removal of forms, exposed bars or bolts, if any, shall be cut inside the 
concrete member to a depth of at least 50 mm below the surface of the concrete and the 
resulting holes filled with cement mortar. All fins caused by form joints, all cavities produced 
by the removal of form ties and all other holes and depressions, honeycomb spots, broken 
edges or corners, and other defects, shall be thoroughly cleaned, saturated with water and 
carefully pointed and rendered true with mortar. The mortar shall be of cement and fine 
aggregate mixed in the proportions used in the grade of concrete that is being finished and 
of as dry a consistency as possible. Considerable pressure shall be applied in filling and 
pointing to ensure thorough filling in all voids. Surfaces which have been pointed shall be 
kept moist for a period of twenty four hours. Special pre-packaged proprietary mortars shall 
be used where appropriate or where specified in the drawing.
All construction and expansion joints in the completed work shall be left carefully tooled and 
free from any mortar and concrete. Expansion joint filler shall be left exposed for its full length 
with clean and true edges.
Immediately on removal of forms, the concrete work shall be examined by the Engineer 
before any defects are made good. The work that has sagged or contains honeycombing to 
an extent detrimental to structural safety or architectural appearance of the member, shall be 
rejected. Surface defects of a minor nature may be accepted. On acceptance of such work, 
the same shall be rectified as directed by the Engineer.
1714	
CONCRETE WITH BLENDED CEMENTS OR MINERAL ADMIXTURES
1714.1	
Production of Concrete
In order to improve the durability of the concrete, use of blended cement or blending of 
mineral admixtures, is permitted. The maximum limit of flyash and ground granulated blast 
furnace slag in concrete, shall be as specified in Clause 1715.2. Blending at site shall be 
permitted only through a specific facility with complete automated process control to achieve 
the specified design quality or through RMC plants with similar facility.
1714.2 
Modified Properties
For concrete made with Portland Pozzolona Cement, Portland Blast furnace slag cement 
or mineral admixtures, the setting time and rate of gain of strength are different from those 
of concrete made with OPC alone. Cognizance of such modified properties shall be taken

in deciding de-shuttering time, initial time of prestressing, curing period and for early age 
loading.
1714.3	
Compatibility of Chemical Admixtures
Compatibility of chemical admixtures and superplasticizers with Portland Pozzolona cement, 
Portland blast furnace slag cement and mineral admixtures shall be ensured by trials outlined 
in Clause 1705.
1714.4	
Additional Tests
In addition to the strength tests prescribed in other Sections of these Specifications, the 
following additional tests are required to be carried out from considerations of durability.
	
i)	
Rapid Chloride Ion Permissibility Test
	
	
Rapid Chloride Ion permeability test on as per ASTM C 1202 at 
56 days for extreme, very severe and severe conditions of exposure. The 
permissible value of Chloride-Ion permeability for extreme condition 800 
Coulombs very severe condition 1200 coulombs and severe exposure 
condition 1500 coulombs.
	
ii)	
Water Permeability Test
	
	
Water permeability test as per DIN: 1048 Part 5-1991 shall be carried 
out as described in Clause 1717.2.5.5.
1715	
High  Performance  Concrete
1715.1	
General
High Performance Concrete shall be used where special performance requirements of high 
strength, high early strength, high workability, low permeability and high durability for severe 
service environments, are required. Production and use of such concrete in the field shall 
be carried out with high degree of uniformity between batches and very stringent quality 
control.
1715.2	
Materials
Cement, mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures, aggregates and water shall conform to 
Section 1000 of these Specifications and this Section.

1715.5	
Workability and Other Requirements
Workability, concrete mix design, field trial mixes, chloride and sulphate contents shall be as 
laid down in other Sections of these Specifications.
1715.6	
Mixing of Concrete
The concreting plant and means of transportation employed to make trial mixes and to 
transport them to representative distances shall be similar to the corresponding plant and 
transport to be used in the works. The optimum sequence of mixing of ingredients shall be 
established by trials. Mixing time may be longer than in normal grade concrete mixes.
The temperature of concrete at the time of placement shall not exceed 25°C. The temperature 
of concrete at the mixing stage should be lower, to allow for rise in temperature during 
transport. When considerable distance of transport is involved, particular attention should be 
paid to ensure retention of slump as targeted for placement.
1715.7	
Prototype Testing
Mock-up trials or prototype testing may be carried out to ensure that the concrete can be 
satisfactorily placed and compacted, taking into account the location of placement and 
provision of reinforcement, and required adjustments made in concrete mix design and/or 
detailing of reinforcement.
1715.8	
Curing of Concrete
High performance concrete containing silica fume is more cohesive than normal mixes hence, 
there is a little or no bleeding and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset water loss 
due to evaporation. Plastic shrinkage cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial curing 
should commence soon after initial setting of concrete. Concrete should be covered with 
moist covers, opaque colour plastic sheets or suitable curing compound. Final moist curing 
should commence after final setting of concrete and continue for at least 14 days.
1715.9	
Additional Tests for Concrete
Apart from the strength tests prescribed in other Sections of these Specifications, the 
additional tests as specified under Clause 1714.3, shall also be carried out.
1716	
TOLERANCES
Tolerances for dimensions/shape of various components shall be as indicated in these 
Specifications or shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.
1717	
TESTS  AND  STANDARDS  OF  ACCEPTANCE
1717.1	
Concrete shall conform to the surface finish and tolerance as prescribed in 
these Specifications for respective components.

28 days cube strength of concrete.
1717.3	
Concrete under acceptance, shall be notionally divided into lots for the 
purpose of sampling before commencement of work. The basis of delimitation of lots shall be 
as follows:
	
i)	
No individual lot shall be more than 30 cu.m in volume
	
ii)	
Different grades of mixes of concrete shall be divided into separate lots.
	
iii)	
Concrete of a lot shall be used in the same identifiable component of 
the bridge.
1717.4	
Sampling and Testing
Concrete for preparing 3 test cubes shall be taken from a batch of concrete at point of delivery 
for construction, according to procedure laid down in IS:1199.
A random sampling procedure shall be adopted which ensures that each of the concrete 
batches forming the lot under acceptance inspection has equal chance of being chosen for 
taking cubes.
150 mm cubes shall be made, cured and tested at the age of 28 days for compressive 
strength in accordance with IS:516. The 28 day test strength result for each cube shall form 
an item of the sample. Tests at other age shall also be performed, if specified.
Where automated batching plant/Ready Mixed Concrete Plant is located away from the place 
of use and the time gap between production and placement is more than the initial setting 
time or where any ingredients are added subsequent to mixing, separate sets of samples 
shall be collected and tested at batching plant and at location of placement. The results shall 
be compared and used to make suitable adjustment at batching plants so that properties of 
concrete at placement are as per the requirements.
1717.5	
Test Specimen and Sample Strength
Three test specimens shall be made from each sample for testing at 28 days. Additional 
cubes may be required for various purposes such as to determine the strength of concrete at 
7 days or for any other purpose.
The test strength of the sample shall be the average of the strength of 3 cubes. The individual 
variation should not be more than ±15 percent of the average. If variation is more, the test 
results of the sample are invalid.

Positioning
1805.3.1	
Post Tensioning
Prestressing tendons shall be accurately located and maintained in position, both vertically 
and horizontally, as per drawings.
Tendons shall be so arranged that they have a smooth profile without sudden bends or 
kinks.
The location of prestressed cables shall be such as to facilitate easy placement and vibration 
of concrete in between the tendons. High capacity tendons shall be used to reduce the 
number of cables thereby eliminating the necessity of grouping. The selected profiles of the 
tendons shall be such that their anchorages are not located in the top deck surface. Where 
two or more rows of cables have to be used, the cables shall be vertically in line to enable 
easy flow of concrete. The clear vertical and horizontal distance between any two cable ducts 
shall in no case be less than 50 mm or diameter of duct, whichever is greater, when grouping 
of cable is not involved. Where precast segments are used, the clear distance between 
cables shall be at least 150 mm.
Sheathing shall be placed in correct position and profile by providing suitable ladders and 
spacers. Such ladders may be provided at intervals of approximately 1.0 m. Sheathing 
shall be tied rigidly with such ladders/spacer bars, so that they do not get disturbed during 
concreting.
The method of supporting and fixing shall be such that profile of cables is not disturbed during 
vibrations, by pressure of wet concrete, by workmen or by construction traffic.
Sheathing in which the permanent tendon will not be in place during concreting shall have a 
temporary tendon inserted or shall be stiffened by some other method to the approval of the 
Engineer. The temporary tendon shall be pulled out by a special threading machine or other 
contrivance, before threading the permanent tendon.
Where possible, tendons shall be placed prior to stressing. Tendons shall be handled with 
care to avoid damage or contamination, to either the tendon or the sheathing. Any tendons 
which are damaged or contaminated shall be cleaned or replaced.
1805.3.2	
Pre-tensioning
Prestressing steel shall be accurately located and maintained in position, both vertically and 
horizontally, as per drawings.

1805.3.3	
Each anchorage device shall be set square to the line of action of the 
corresponding prestressing tendon and shall be positioned securely to prevent movement 
during concreting.
The anchorage devices shall be cleaned to the satisfaction of the Engineer, prior to the 
placing of concrete. After concreting, any mortar or concrete which adheres to bearing or 
wedging surfaces, shall be removed immediately.
1805.4	
Cutting
Cutting and trimming of wires or strands shall be done by suitable mechanical or flame 
cutters. When a flame cutter is used, care shall be taken to ensure that the flame does not 
come in contact with other stressed steel. The flame cutting of wire or strand shall be carried 
out at least 75 mm beyond the point where the tendon will be gripped by the anchorage or 
jacks.
In post tensioned members, the ends of prestressing steel projecting beyond the anchorages, 
shall be cut after the grout has set.
1805.5	
Protection of Prestressing Steel
Prestressing steel shall be continuously protected against corrosion, until grouted. The 
corrosion protector shall have no deleterious effect on the steel or concrete or on the bond 
strength of steel to concrete. Grouting shall conform to these Specifications or as directed by 
the Engineer.
In the case of external prestressing, steel shall be encased in suitable polyethelene pipes 
before grouting.
1805.6	
Sheathing Duct Joints
1805.6.1	
General
The sheathing and all joints shall be water tight and shall withstand a pressure of 1.1 times 
the grouting pressure and maximum grouting head due to grout. Any temporary opening in 
the sheathing shall be satisfactorily plugged and all joints between sheathing and any other 
part of the prestressing system, shall be effectively sealed to prevent entry of mortar, dust, 
water or other deleterious matter. Sheathing shall be neatly fitted at joints without internal 
projection or reduction of diameter.
Enlarged portions of the sheathing at couplings or anchorages shall be of sufficient length to 
provide for the extension of the tendons.

Special attention shall be paid to the junction at the anchorage end, where the sheathing must 
be tightly fitted on the protruding trumpet end of anchorage and thereafter sealed preferably 
with tape, to make it water-proof.
1805.6.2	
Coupling of MS Sheathing Ducts
For major projects, the sheathing duct should preferably be manufactured at the project site 
utilizing appropriate machines. With such an arrangement, long lengths of sheathing ducts 
may be used with consequent reduction in the number of joints and couplers.
Where sheathing duct joints are unavoidable, they shall be made cement slurry tight by the 
use of corrugated threaded sleeve couplers, which can be tightly screwed on to the outer 
side of the sheathing ducts.
The length of the coupler should not be less than 150 mm but should be increased upto 
200 mm wherever practicable. The joints between the end of coupler and duct shall be sealed 
with tape to prevent penetration of slurry during concreting. The couplers of adjacent ducts 
shall be staggered wherever practicable. As far as possible, couplers should not be located 
in curved zones. The corrugated sleeve couplers can be conveniently manufactured using 
the sheath making machine with the next higher size of die set.

surface shall be painted with two coats of epoxy of suitable formulation having a dry film 
thickness of 80 micron per coat and entire recess shall be filled with concrete or non-shirk/
pre-packaged mortar of epoxy concrete.
1806	
SUPERVISION
Prestressing operation and grouting shall be entrusted only to specially trained and qualified 
personnel. All prestressing accessories shall be procured from authorized manufacturers 
with in-house testing facilities. The Contractor shall be required to engage specialized 
agencies who should also be entrusted with the total service contract for fabrication of cables, 
protection of cables during concreting, prestressing and grouting. Necessary certificates shall 
be accorded by such specialized agencies that the work has been carried out in accordance 
with prescribed specifications. In exceptional cases, the prestressing and grouting operations 
could be entrusted to the bridge Contractor himself, if the Employer is convinced that he is 
well experienced and has qualified personnel and sufficient track record to substantiate his 
performance in the particular system of prestressing being adopted,.
1807	
TENSIONING  EQUIPMENT
All tensioning equipment shall be procured from authorized manufacturers only and be 
approved by the Engineer prior to use. Where hydraulic jacks are used, they shall be power-
driven unless otherwise approved by the Engineer. The tensioning equipment shall satisfy 
the following requirements :
	
i)	
The means of attachments of the prestressing steel to the jack or any 
other tensioning apparatus shall be safe and secure.
	
ii)	
Where two or more wires/strands constitute a tendon, a single multi-

Section 1800
573
	
iii)	
The tensioning equipment shall be such that it can apply controlled total 
force gradually on the concrete without inducing dangerous secondary 
stresses in steel, anchorage or concrete.
	
iv)	
Means shall be provided for direct measurement of the force by use of 
dynamometers or pressure gauges fitted in the hydraulic system itself 
to determine the pressure in the jacks. Facilities shall also be provided 
for the liner measurement of the extension of prestressing steel to the 
nearest mm and of any slip of the gripping devices at transfer.
All dynamometers and pressure gauges including a master gauge shall be calibrated by an 
approved laboratory immediately prior to use and then at intervals not exceeding 3 months 
and the true force determined from the calibration curve.
Pressure gauges shall be concentric scale type gauges accurate to within two percent of 
their full capacity. The minimum nominal size of gauge shall be 100 mm. The gauge shall be 
so selected that when the tendon is stressed to 75 percent of its breaking load, the gauge is 
reading between 50 percent and 80 percent of its full capacity. Suitable safety devices shall 
be fitted to protect pressure gauges against sudden release of pressure.
Provision shall be made for the attachment of the master gauge to be used as a check, 
whenever requested for by the Engineer.
Jack and pump shall be calibrated from an approved laboratory prior to use and then at 
intervals not exceeding three months.
1808	
POST  TENSIONING
Tensioning force shall be applied in gradual and steady steps, in such a manner that the 
applied tensions and elongations can be measured at all times. The sequence of stressing, 
applied tensions and elongations shall be in accordance with the approved drawing or as 
directed by the Engineer.
It shall be ensured that in no case, the load is applied to the concrete before it attains the 
strength specified on the drawing or as stipulated by the prestressing system supplier, 
whichever is more.
After prestressing steel has been anchored, the force exerted by the tensioning equipment 
shall be decreased gradually and steadily so as to avoid shock to the prestressing steel or 
anchorage.
The tensioning force applied to any tendon shall be determined by direct reading of the 
pressure gauges or dynamo-meters and by comparison of the measured elongation with the 
calculated elongation. The calculated elongation shall be invariably adjusted with respect to 
the modulus of elasticity of steel for the particular lot as given by the manufacturer.



======================================================================
PAGE 593 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1800
Prestressing
574
The difference between calculated and observed tension and elongation during prestressing 
operations shall be regulated as follows :
	
a)	
If the calculated elongation is reached before the specified gauge 
pressure, continue tensioning till the specified gauge pressure is 
attained, provided the elongation does not exceed 1.05 times the 
calculated elongation. If 1.05 times the calculated elongation is reached 
before the specified gauge pressure is attained, stop stressing and 
inform the Engineer.
	
b)	
If the calculated elongation has not been reached at the specified 
gauge pressure, continue tensioning by intervals of 5 kg/sq. cm until 
the calculated elongation is reached, provided the gauge pressure 
does not exceed 1.05 times the specified gauge pressure.
	
c)	
If the elongation at 1.05 times the specified gauge pressure is less than 
0.95 times the calculated elongation, the following measures must be 
taken, in succession, to determine the cause of this discrepancy:
	
i)	
Check the correct functioning of the jack, pump and leads.
	
ii)	
De-tension the cable. Slide it in its duct to check that it is not 
blocked by mortar which has entered through holes in the sheath. 
Re-tension the cable, if free.
	
iii)	
Re-establish the modulus of elasticity of steel for the particular lot 
from an approved laboratory.
	
	
If the required elongation is still not obtained, further finishing 
operations such as cutting or sealing, should not be undertaken 
without the approval of the Engineer.
	
d)	
When stressing from one end only, the slip at the end remote from the 
jack, shall be accurately measured and an appropriate allowance made 
in the measured extension at the jacking end.
A complete record of prestressing operations along with elongation and jack pressure data 
shall be maintained in the format given in Appendix 1800/II.
The number of stages of prestressing and grouting shall be kept to a minimum, preferably 
two in the case of simply supported girders.
1809	
GROUTING  OF  PRESTRESSED  TENDONS
Grouting of prestressed tendons shall be carried out in accordance with provisions given in 
Appendix 1800/III.  A record of grouting operations shall be maintained in the format given in 
Appendix 1800/IV.

Pre-tensioning
1810.1	
General
The planning and construction aspects of the tensioning bed, tensioning bench, abutments 
at location of anchorage, steam curing system, formwork of the concrete elements and 
arrangements for de-moulding, lifting, stacking and transportation of the pre-tensioned 
concrete elements are all specialised items of work and shall be entrusted to engineers 
specifically experienced in this type of work.
1810.2	
Concrete Mix Requirements
Minimum cement content, maximum water cement ratio and other durability requirement 
shall be same as indicated in Table 1700-2 and Table 1700-3 of these Specifications except 
that minimum grade of concrete shall be M40.
1810.3	
Form Work
All sides, bottoms and header forms shall be of steel or any other suitable material. Forms 
shall be of sufficient thickness, with adequate external bracing and shall be stiffened and 
adequately anchored to withstand the forces due to placement and vibration of concrete. All 
joints of form work shall be leak proof. The bottom shutter shall have arrangement to permit 
longitudinal movement of girder concrete, which occurs while imparting prestress. Identifying 
marks shall be placed on the girders to indicate the correct orientation to ensure correct 
debonding locations, which may not be symmetrical, longitudinally.
1810.4 
Laying of Deflected Tendons
For long span pre-tensioned girders, deflected tendons shall be used instead of the 
conventional straight tendons. This requires the use of hold-up/hold-down devices at each 
deflected location, in order to hold the tendons in the desired profile and location. A hold-
down device normally consists of rollers attached to a vertical rod, which passes through the 
bottom form and is anchored to the form substructure or foundation to resist the prestress 
force. The force which must be resisted by the hold-up/hold-down device, and therefore its 
size, depends on the number of deflected strands and the trajectory angles of the strands. 
The strand can be either tensioned after it is held in its deflected profile by means of hold-up/
hold-down devices or it can be tensioned first and then brought into its deflected profile. The 
number of deflected strands and their angle directly influence the size and cost of the hold-
up/hold-down devices.
1810.5	
Production and Testing of Concrete
A fully automated, computer-controlled batching plant shall be used. The batching plant shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 595 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1800
Prestressing
576
be provided with moisture measuring and compensating devices and automatic pump for 
dispensing admixtures.
Sampling and testing of concrete shall be as per Section 1700 of these Specifications. 
Additional cubes shall be prepared to determine the concrete strength at the time of removal of 
forms and transfer of prestress. Adequate number of samples shall be taken for this purpose, 
which shall be cured in identical conditions to those of the concrete of respective girders.
1810.6	
Compaction, Removal of Form Work and Curing
Compaction of concrete may be achieved through needle vibrators or form vibrators along with 
needle vibrators. For casting of precast beams, any of the two commonly known techniques 
of precasting viz. (i) Long Line method or (ii) Short Line method maybe used.
The girders shall not be moved from the casting location until stipulated strength requirements 
have been attained. The concrete shall have attained a minimum compressive strength of 
20 MPa at the time of removal of forms. Curing of concrete may be achieved through water 
or steam followed by water curing. Approved curing compound may also be used.
Longitudinal movement of the girders that takes place while releasing the prestress shall 
be suitably catered for. In case of long line method of precasting, adequate longitudinal 
gap shall be provided between girder ends during precasting, to accommodate projecting 
reinforcement and required length of the projecting strands.
1810.7	
Stressing Bed for Pre-tensioning
The abutments and bed for pre-tensioning of tendons shall be designed to withstand the total 
tensioning force.
A notice shall be displayed adjacent to the stressing bed showing the maximum tensioning 
force permitted.
Where concrete elements are cast and prestressed individually, the stressing bench or moulds 
shall be rigid enough to sustain the reaction of the prestressing force without distortion.
In the long line method of prestressing, sufficient locator plates should be distributed 
throughout the length of the bed to ensure that the wires are maintained in their proper 
position during concreting. The moulds shall be free to slide in the direction of their length 
and thus permit the transfer of the prestressing force to all the concrete elements along the 
whole line.
Sufficient space shall be left in between the ends of concrete elements to permit access for 
cutting the strands/wires after transfer. Hold-downs or deflectors shall be used for holding 



======================================================================

Prestressing
Section 1800
577
or deflecting the tendons in required position firmly. Deflectors which are in contact with the 
tendon shall have a diameter not less than the tendon or 15 mm, whichever is more.
The tensioning force required to be applied as stated on the drawings shall be the force 
remaining in the strands/wires after all strands/wires have been anchored to the abutments 
of the stressing bed and after the anchorage slip has already taken place. The tensioning 
force shall be determined by direct reading of the pressure gauges or dynamo-meters and by 
the measured elongation after slip.
The Contractor shall submit method of tensioning the tendons including the arrangement 
and layout of prestressing beds and all tendon deflection points, to the Engineer for approval 
before manufacture commences. The Contractor shall carry out trial stressing operations to 
establish the frictional resistance offered by the hold-downs and the slip during anchoring.
Debonding of strands, wherever required, shall be carried out using HDPE debonding tubes. 
PVC tubes shall not be permitted for this purpose. After pre-tensioning the strands and before 
concreting, a recheck shall be made to ensure that the debonding tubes are placed at the 
intended locations. Both ends of debonding tubes shall be effectively sealed against ingress 
of any cement slurry using epoxy putty or any other suitable material.
The Contractor shall also submit calculation showing that the hold-downs have been 
designed and constructed to withstand concentrated loads resulting from the application of 
the tensioning force.
1810.8	
Pre-tensioning and De-tensioning Operations
1810.8.1	
Pre-tensioning of Strands
Pretensioning of strands may be carried out either using single-pull jack or multi-pull jack. 
In case of the former, it shall be ensured at each stage, that the strands are stressed 
symmetrically, so that the supporting system of the strands does not rotate or distort. This 
may be achieved through suitably designed moving trolley engaging the strands or any other 
suitable arrangement. Prestressing force shall be transferred to metallic spacer, trolley, etc. 
so that the force does not remain on the hydraulic system for long.
It is necessary to apply a small prestressing force, through hydraulic jacks to remove slackness 
of the strands. After removal of the slackness, the strands must be thoroughly examined 
to ensure correct alignment, including that of the debonding tubes. Reference marks for 
measuring elongation shall then be established and the full strand load is applied thereafter. 
Loads indicted by the gauging system shall control the tensioning, with elongation checked 
on every strand.



======================================================================
PAGE 597 of 903
======================================================================
Section 1800
Prestressing
578
It shall be ensured that the entire length of each strand between the grips is free of any 
defects. This is of particular importance while precasting girders using long line method 
entailing, longer pieces of strands between the grips.
Transfer of prestress shall not proceed until the Engineer has approved the proposed 
method. Strands and deflection devices shall be released in such a pre-determined order 
that unacceptable tensile stresses are not induced in the concrete.
Prior to transfer of the force to the units, all strands shall be tested for tightness and any loose 
strands shall be reported to the Engineer, who will decide whether the affected units should 
be rejected.
The Engineer may require that strands be marked at each end of any unit to allow 
measurement of the pull-in of the strands.
The sequence of transfer of prestressing force shall be done strictly as indicated in the 
drawings and ensuring that eccentricities of the prestressing force in the vertical and horizontal 
directions of the concrete element are minimum during the entire sequence.
The maximum slip of any tendon during transfer shall not exceed 3 mm for bottom strands and 
5.5 mm for a top strands at any end of the concrete element. In case the slip exceeds above 
value, design of the member shall be got checked for the actual slip before acceptance.
1810.8.2	
De-tensioning of Strands
Detensioning, in order to impart the prestress shall be effected gradually, so that there is no 
significant loss of bond due to slippage of strands and consequent increase in the transmission 
length. For detensioning, the trolley is pulled outward by a small distance, in order to release 
the metallic spacers, before releasing the prestressing force. Even when the pretensioning is 
carried out through single-pull jack, the release of the force in all the strands, while imparting 
the prestress to the concrete, shall be simultaneous. It shall be ensured that, during this 
process, prestressing forces at any stage does not exceed 90 percent of 0.1 percent proof 
stress.
1810.9	
Cutting of Strands
Cutting of strands shall be carried out carefully so as not to affect the untensioned 
reinforcement which is in their close proximity. Diamond bit saw shall be used to cut the 
strands. Strands and untensioned reinforcement shall be so arranged that the untensioned 
reinforcement and those strands which are required to be extended into the adjoining cast 
in-situ concrete, do not get affected during cutting operation.
Under factory conditions, flame cutting may be resorted to. Yellow flame should be used 
first to heat the strand without introducing undue stresses and then blue flame for the 



======================================================================
PAGE 598 of 903
======================================================================
Prestressing
Section 1800
579
actual cutting. Heat cutting of strand shall be carried out symmetrically about the vertical axis 
of the members. One strand at a time on each side of the vertical axis for all girders in a long 
line shall be cut in the same manner. The above process shall be repeated till all the strands 
are cut. This will ensure gradual and uniform transfer of prestress to girders.
1811	
Protection  of  Ends
The exposed ends of the strands and the concrete surfaces of the ends of the units shall be 
wire brushed clean of all rust, loose mortar, grease and dirt.
The exposed ends of the strands and concrete surface within 50 mm of tendons shall be then 
abraded to provide a clean sound surface. An epoxy tar paint suitably formulated to give a 
dry film thickness of 80 micron per coat, shall then be immediately applied over the ends of 
the tendons unless otherwise directed.
A second coat of paint shall be applied prior to the drying out of the first coat.
1812	
Safety  Precautions  During  Tensioning
Care shall be taken during tensioning to ensure the safety of all persons in the vicinity.
Jacks shall be secured in such a manner that they will remain in position, even if their grip on 
the strand is lost.
No person shall be allowed to stand behind the jacks or close to the line of the tendons while 
tensioning is in progress.
The operations of the jacks and measurement of the elongation shall be carried out in such 
a manner and that the safety of all concerned is ensured.
A safety barrier shall be provided at both ends to prevent any tendon which might become 
loose, from recoiling unchecked.
During actual tensioning operation, warning signs shall be displayed at both ends of the 
tendon.
After prestressing, concrete shall not be drilled cut, chipped, or disturbed in anyway, without 
express approval of the Engineer.
No welding shall be permitted on or near strands nor shall any heat be applied to tendons. 
Any strand which has been affected by welding or weld spatter or heat shall be rejected.
1813	
Surface  Preparation
All surfaces, coming in contact with deck slab/ diaphragm shall be adequately prepared by 
green cutting, using surface retarders, by mechanical means to remove the laitance and 



======================================================================

just expose the aggregates. Usually, precast girders join the cast in-situ concrete of end 
diaphragms at the points of high shear stress. Therefore, it is extremely important to adequately 
prepare the end faces of the girders for effective bonding of the new concrete. This shall be 
done using suitable mechanical means(such as 100% hacking) to ensure that the course 
aggregates are just exposed. Surface retarders, may also be used for this purpose.
1814	
Transportation 
Storage 
and 
Handling 
of 
Precast 
Girders
Precast girders shall be transported in an upright position. Points of support and the direction of 
the reactions with respect to the girder shall approximately be the same during transportation, 
and storage as when the girder is placed in final position.
Method of transportation should be planned in such a way that the vehicle employed to 
transport the long girders can successfully negotiate the available road geometry. Adequate 
care shall be taken to ensure that the girder being transported does not topple due to unstable 
arrangement. For this purpose, height of the vehicle shall be kept as low as possible. This will 
also help in accommodating greater height of the system during transportation below existing 
bridges or through any other constraints. Girders should be transported only after 28 day 
concrete strength is achieved.
When members are to be stacked, they shall be firmly supported at such bearing positions 
as will ensure the stresses induced in them are always less than the permissible design 
stresses. Further, inclined side supports shall be provided at the ends and along the length 
of a precast girder to prevent lateral movements or instability.
Care shall be taken during storage, hoisting and handling of precast units to prevent them 
from being cracked or damaged. Units cracked or damaged by improper storing or handling, 
shall be replaced by the Contractor at his cost.
Handling of precast girders from precasting location to the bridge site requires careful 
operation. Lifting location shall be strictly as indicated on the construction drawings.
Lifting devices generally consist of loops of prestressing strand or mild steel bars or any 
other suitable arrangement. If it is anticipated that embedded material for lifting devices will 
be cast into the face of the member that will be exposed to view or to corrosive materials in 
the completed structure, the depth of removal of the embedded material and the method of 
filling the resulting cavities, shall be as shown on the construction drawings. The depth of 
removal shall not be less than the clear cover required to the reinforcing steel. The cavity 
so formed shall be suitably grouted for protecting the embedded metal. Also, the projecting 
reinforcement shall be suitably protected against corrosion.

compliance of codal requirements.
All joint surfaces for bolted connection including bolts, nuts and washers shall be free of 
scale, dirt, burrs, other foreign material and other defects that would prevent solid seating of 
parts. The slope of surface of bolted parts in contact with bolt head and nuts shall not exceed 
1:20 plane normal to bolt axis; otherwise suitable tapered washer shall be used.
All fasteners shall have a washer under nut or bolt head, whichever is turned in tightening.
Each fastener of joint shall be tightened to specified value or to 70 percent of specified 
minimum tensile strength by hand wrenches (turn of nut method) or calibrated wrenches, 
manual torque wrenches, impact wrench or any other method specified by the Engineer.
When ‘turn of nut’ method is used for tightening the bolts in a joint, all bolts shall be first 
brought to snug-tight condition i.e. tightening by full manual effort using ordinary wrench or by 
a few impacts of any impact wrench. All bolts in the joint shall then be tightened additionally 
by applicable amount of nut rotation as specified in IS:4000.
The Engineer shall observe the installation and tightening of bolts to ensure that correct 
tightening procedure is used and all bolts are tightened. Regardless of tightening method 
used, tightening of bolts in a joint should commence at the most rigidly fixed or stiffest point 
and progress towards the free edges, both in initial snugging and in final tightening.
The tightness of bolts in connection shall be checked by inspection wrench, which can be 
torque wrench, power wrench or calibrated wrench.
Tightness of 10 percent bolts, but not less than two bolts, selected at random in each 
connection shall be checked by applying inspection torque. If no nut or bolt head is turned 
by this application, connection can be accepted as properly tightened, but If any nut or head 
has turned, all bolts shall be checked and, if necessary, re-tightened.

These include paints based on drying oils, alkyd resin, modified alkyd 
resin, phenolic varnish epoxy, etc.
	
	
Ordinary painting can generally be sub-divided into two types:
	
a)	
Primary Coats :
	
	
This shall be applied immediately after the surface preparation 
and should have the properties of adhesion, corrosion inhibition 
and imperviousness to water and air.
	
b)	
Finishing Coats :
	
	
This shall be applied over the primary coat and should have the 
properties of durability, abrasion resistance, aesthetic appearance 
and smooth finish.
	
ii)	
Chemical Resistant Paints
	
	
The more highly corrosion resistant paints can be divided into two main 
groups :
	
a)	
One pack paints (ready for use)
	
b)	
Two pack paints (mixed before use)
	
	
The two pack paints shall be mixed together just before use since 
they remain workable thereafter only for a restricted period of 
time.
	
iii)	
Other types of paints as mentioned in Clause 1903.4 of this Section 
may also be used, subject to approval by the Engineer.
All paints shall conform to relevant IS Standards as appropriate.
1906.1.2	
Surfaces which are inaccessible for cleaning and painting after fabrication 
shall be painted as specified before being assembled for riveting.
All rivets, bolts, nuts, washers etc., are to be thoroughly cleaned and dipped into boiling 
linseed oil conforming to IS:77.
All machined surfaces are to be well coated with a mixture of white lead conforming to IS:34 
and mutton tallow conforming to IS:887.
In site painting, the whole of the steel work shall be given the second cover coat after final 
passing and after touching up the primer and cover coats, if damaged in transit.

cleaned surface before any deterioration of the surface is visible. In any case, the surface 
shall receive one coat of primer within 4 hours of abrasive blast cleaning.
All coats shall be compatible with each other. When metal based coatings are used, the 
undercoat shall be compatible with the concerned metal base. The undercoat and finishing 
coat shall preferably be from the same manufacturer. Successive coats of paints shall be of 
different shades or colours and each shall be allowed to dry thoroughly before the next is 
applied. Particular care shall be taken with the priming and painting of edges, corners, welds 
and rivets. Typical guidelines for epoxy based paints and the conventional painting system 
for bridge girders as given below, may be complied with :
	
a)	
Epoxy Based Painting
	
i)

application, shall be coated first by brushing.
Oil based red lead primers must be applied by brush only, taking care to work into all corners 
and crevices.
The primer, intermediate and finishing coats shall all be applied so as to provide smooth coatings 
of uniform thickness. Wrinkled or blistered coatings or coatings with pinholes, sags, lumps or 
other blemishes shall not be accepted. Where the Engineer so directs, the coating shall be 
removed by abrasive blast cleaning and replaced by the Contractor at his own cost.
1906.7	
Protective Coatings in Different Environments
Since the severity of corrosion depends upon atmospheric conditions and these vary 
enormously, there is no single protective system or method of application that is suitable for 
every situation.
Table 1900-3 gives guidelines for various types of coatings to be used in various 
environmental conditions. Approximate life to first maintenance is also indicated.

Section 2000
Bearings
640
For the purpose of grading levels of acceptance testing, a lot size of 24 or larger number of 
bearings shall be defined as a ‘large lot’, while a lot size of less than 24 number of bearings 
shall be defined as a ‘small lot’. 
When the number of bearings of equal or near equal size for a single bridge project is large 
and phased production and acceptance is permitted, the number of bearings supplied in any 
single phase of supply shall comprise a lot under acceptance. When such phased supply 
is made, each such lot shall be considered as a large lot for the purpose of acceptance 
testing.
2005.4.2	
Levels of Acceptance Testing
The following two Levels of acceptance testing shall be adopted, depending on lot size :
Acceptance testing Level 1 is a higher level of inspection and testing and shall be applicable 
to large lots only, unless otherwise specified. This shall involve manufacture of two extra 
bearings for each lot to be used as test bearings and eventually consumed in destructive 
testing.
Acceptance testing Level 2 shall be applicable to small lots only, for which one extra bearing 
shall be manufactured and shall not involve destructive testing of finished bearing. Out of the 
lot, one bearing shall be selected at random for carrying out material tests. This bearing shall 
be excluded from the lot accepted.
Acceptance testing Level 1 may be specified for small lots also at the sole discretion of the 
Engineer taking into account the special importance of a bridge project. The cost of extra 
bearings, in such cases shall be borne by the user, while the cost of all other materials, 
equipment and testing shall be borne by manufacturer.
2005.4.3	
Testing
Acceptance testing shall comprise general inspection, test on specially moulded test pieces 
and test on complete bearings or sections for measurement of various quality characteristics 
detailed below :
2005.4.3.1	
Acceptance Testing Level 1
	
General Inspection
	
i)	
All bearings of the lot shall be visually inspected for absence of any 
defects in surface finish, shape, hardness or any other discernible 
superficial defects.
	
ii)	
All bearings of the lot shall be checked for tolerances for overall 
dimensions, mean bearing thickness, parallelism of bearing surfaces 
and flatness of load bearing surfaces as specified in Table 2000-3.

Section 2000
641
	
iii)	
The test shall be carried out on all bearings as part of the standard 
production process. The temperature of the room in which the bearings 
are tested shall not vary more than 10 ºC. The main objective of this 
test is to eliminate poorly made bearings by visual inspection in a quick 
and efficient way. All bearings of the lot shall be subjected to an axial 
load to correspond to the design load at serviceability limit state while 
visual examination is made to check for discernible defects like:
	
	
Misalignment of reinforcing plates
	
	
Poor bond at laminate/steel interface
	
	
Variation in elastomer layer thickness
	
	
Any surface defects developed during testing
	
iv)	
During acceptance testing, complete test data shall be furnished by the 
manufacturer and one bearing per lot shall be selected at random and 
the same test shall be repeated. The bearings shall then be visually 
inspected for defects and the stiffness shall also be measured.
	
v)	
During the test, the deflection between 30 percent and 100 percent of 
the maximum load for the application shall be recorded and used to 
check the consistency of the stiffness value. Variation in stiffness of 
any individual bearing from the mean of the measured values for all 
such bearings of the lot, shall not be larger than 20 percent of the mean 
value.
	
vi)	
In case of any visual defect or unacceptable stiffness during acceptance 
testing, all bearings of the lot shall be subjected to the same test again 
and only the bearing that passes the test in all respects, shall be 
accepted.
	
Tests on Specially Moulded Test Pieces
	
i)	
Test pieces shall be moulded by the manufacturer with identical 
compound and under identical vulcanising conditions as used in the 
manufacture of the bearings of the acceptance lot. The process shall 
be open to inspection by the Inspector/Engineer.
	
ii)	
Test pieces offered for inspection shall be identified by suitable markings 
and duly certified by the manufacturer.
	
iii)	
The quality characteristics to be tested are listed below. The specification 
reference in parenthesis shall define the corresponding specification 
for test piece, test method and criterion for acceptance.

Ozone resistance test can be waived by the Engineer for bearings of CR when satisfactory 
results of ozone resistance tests on similar grade of elastomer may be available from 
process control records or development test data furnished by the manufacturer.
	
Where such process control data are not available or the frequency of testing not deemed 
adequate, ozone resistance test shall be mandatory for acceptance of bearings of CR.
	
However, such tests may not be insisted upon for bearings not located in adverse 
conditions of exposure and where the test on accelerated ageing could be considered as 
adequate.
	
Process and acceptance control tests for ozone resistance by an independent testing 
agency shall be acceptable.

shall not be deemed to secure bearings against displacement for the 
purpose of design.
	
ix)	
Lifting of a cast in-situ post-tensioned bridge deck for relieving time 
dependent deformation shortly after installation of bearings, should be 
avoided. In case such lifting is unavoidable, the lifting arrangement, 
proper seating of the girder on the bearing, etc. shall be rigidly controlled 
to avoid any risk of misalignment.
	
x)	
Bulging of the rubber layer between the reinforcing steel laminates on 
free exposed perimeter under load, which is a normal phenomenon, 
shall be examined carefully for detecting any evidence of crack or bond 
failure.
	
xi)	
In case seating of bearings on a non-horizontal plane is required, it shall 
be carried out in accordance with acceptable practice and particular 
specifications as may be laid out and directed by the Engineer.
	
xii)	
As a measure of ample precaution against accidental displacement,

Installation
2006.5.1	
General
	
i)	
Bearings shall be so located as to avoid the accumulation of dirt and 
debris on or around them. Detailing of the structure shall be such that 
water is prevented from reaching the bearings.



======================================================================
PAGE 676 of 903
======================================================================
Bearings
Section 2000
657
	
ii)	
In order to avoid contamination of moving surfaces, bearings should 
not normally be dismantled after leaving the manufacturer’s workshop. 
However, if for any reason, a bearing is required to be dismantled, it 
shall be done only under expert supervision for which the manufacturer’s 
help may be sought.
	
iii)	
Transfer of load from the superstructure to the bearings should not be 
allowed until the bedding material has developed sufficient strength. 
Temporary clamping devices should be removed at the appropriate 
time before the bearings are required to accommodate movement. 
The holes exposed on removal of temporary transit clamps should be 
filled with selected material. Where re-use of these fixing holes may 
be required, the material used for filling the holes should be capable of 
being easily removed without damaging the threads.
	
iv)	
Suitable temporary supporting arrangements under bearing base 
plates should be made to accommodate thermal movement and elastic 
deformation of the incomplete superstructure. Such temporary supports, 
if provided, should be removed once the bedding material has reached 
its required strength. Any voids left as a consequence of their removal 
should be made good using the same bedding material. Steel folding 
wedges and rubber pads are suitable for use as temporary supports 
under bearing plates.
2006.5.2	
Bedding
	
i)	
The bedding material shall be selected keeping in view a number of 
factors such as the type and size of bearing, construction sequence, 
load on the bearing, required setting time, friction requirements, access 
around bearings, design and condition of surface in the bearing area 
and thickness, strength and shrinkage of bedding material.
	
ii)	
Commonly used bedding materials are cementitious or chemical resin 
mortar and grout. In some cases, it may be necessary to carry out trials 
to ascertain the most suitable material.
	
iii)	
The bedding material, whether above or below the bearing, should 
extend over the whole area of the bearing in order to ensure even 
loading. After installation, there shall be no voids or hard spots. The top 
surface of any extension of the bedding beyond the bearing shall have 
a downward slope away from the bearing.
	
iv)	
The bedding material shall be capable of transmitting the applied load 
to the structure without being damaged. Surfaces to receive bedding 
mortar shall be suitably prepared so as to be compatible with the mortar 
chosen.

2006.5.3	
Fixing of Bearings
	
i)	
Bearings should be anchored in order to counter vibration and accidental 
impact. Anchorage should be accurately set into recesses cast into the 
structure using templates. The remaining space in the recesses should 
be filled with material capable of withstanding the loads.
	
ii)	
Bearings that are to be installed on temporary supports should be 
firmly fixed to the substructure by anchorage or other means to prevent 
disturbance during subsequent operations. Voids beneath the bearings 
should be completely filled with bedding material using the appropriate 
method.
	
iii)	
Bearings may be fixed directly to metal bedding plates that may be cast 
in or bedded on top of the supporting structure to the correct level and 
location.
	
iv)	
If the structure is of steel, the bearings may be bolted directly onto it. 
Care shall be taken to ensure that there is no mismatch between the 
bolt holes of the structure and those of the bearing.
	
v)	
Threaded fasteners shall be tightened uniformly to avoid overstressing 
of any part of the bearing.
2006.5.4	
Bearings Supporting In-situ Concrete Deck
	
i)	
Where bearings are installed prior to casting of an in-situ concrete deck, 
formwork around bearings should be properly sealed to prevent grout 
leakage. It is essential that the bearings and particularly the working 
surfaces are protected during concreting operations. Sliding plates 
should be fully supported and care taken to prevent tilting, displacement 
or distortion of the bearings under the weight of green concrete. Any 
mortar contaminating the bearings should be completely removed 
before it sets.
	
ii)	
For bearings supporting precast concrete or steel beams, a thin layer 
of synthetic resin mortar should be used between bearings and the 
beams. Bearings shall be bolted to anchor plates or sleeves embedded 
in precast concrete elements or to machined sole plates on steel 
elements.
2006.5.5	
Installation Tolerances
Bearings shall be located so that their centre lines are within ± 3 mm of their correct position. 
The level of a bearing or the mean levels of more than 1 bearing at any support, shall be 
within a tolerance of ± 0.0001 times the sum of the adjacent spans of a continuous girder, but 
not exceeding ± 5 mm. Bearings shall be placed in a horizontal plane within a tolerance of 
1 in 200 in any direction, even under superstructure in gradient.

WORKMANSHIP
2104.1	
Preparation of Foundations
Excavation for laying the foundation shall be carried out in accordance with Section 300 of 
these Specifications. The last 300 mm of excavation shall be done just before laying of lean 
concrete below foundation. Excavation shall be made only to the exact depth as shown 
on the drawing. In the event of excavation having been made deeper than that shown on 
the drawing or as ordered by the Engineer, the extra depth shall be made up with M10 
concrete in case of foundation resting on soil and with concrete of the same grade as that 
of the foundation, in case of foundation resting on rock. This shall be done at the cost of the 
Contractor and shall be considered as incidental to the work.
Open foundations shall be constructed in dry conditions and the Contractor shall provide for 
adequate dewatering arrangements, wherever required, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

Section 2100
Open Foundations
664
Where light blasting is required for excavation in rock or other hard strata, the same shall be 
carried out in accordance with Clause 302 of these Specifications.  Where blasting is likely 
to endanger adjacent foundations or other structures, controlled blasting with all necessary 
precautions shall be resorted to.
2104.2	
Setting Out
The plan dimensions of the foundation shall be set out at the bottom of foundation trench and 
checked with respect to original reference line and axis.
2104.3	
Construction
	
i)	
Excavation for open foundations shall be carried out in accordance 
with Section 300 of these Specifications. For guidance regarding 
safety precautions to be taken, IS:3764 may be referred.
	
ii)	
For foundation resting on soil, a layer of M10 concrete of minimum 
thickness 100 mm shall be provided above the natural ground to 
provide an even surface to support the foundation concrete. Before 
laying of lean concrete layer, the earth surface shall be cleaned of all 
loose material and wetted. Care shall be taken to avoid muddy surface. 
If any part of the surface has become muddy due to over-wetting, the 
same shall be removed. If required, the M10 concrete may be laid to a 
thickness of more than 100 mm, as per the direction of the Engineer. No 
construction joint shall be provided in the lean concrete. For foundations 
resting on rock, the rock surface shall be cleaned of any lose material 
and then levelled with a layer of concrete of the same grade as that of 
the foundation, so as to provide an even surface.
	
iii)	
No point of the surface of the lean concrete, in the case of foundation 
on soil or the surface of hard rock, in the case of foundation on hard 
rock, shall be higher than the founding level shown on the drawing or 
as ordered by the Engineer. Levels of the surface shall be taken at 
intervals of not more than 3 metres centre-to-centre in each direction, 
subject to a minimum of nine levels on the surface.
	
iv)	
No formwork is necessary for the lean concrete layer. Side formwork shall 
be used for foundation concrete work. When concrete is laid in slope without 
top formwork, the slump of the concrete shall be carefully maintained 
to ensure that compaction is possible without slippage of freshly placed 
concrete down the slope. In certain cases it may be necessary to build 
the top formwork progressively as the concreting proceeds up the slope. 
Reinforcement shall be laid as shown on the drawing.
	
v)	
Before laying foundation concrete, the lean concrete or hard rock 
surface shall be cleaned of all loose material and lightly moistened. 
Foundation concrete of required dimensions and shape shall be laid

continuously up to the location of construction joint shown on the 
drawing or as directed by the Engineer.
	
vi)	
The concrete surface shall be finished smooth with a trowel. The 
location of construction joint and its treatment shall be done as per 
requirements of Section 1700 of these Specifications. Formwork 
shall not be removed earlier than 24 hours after placing of concrete. 
Where formwork has been provided for top surface, the same shall be 
removed as soon as concrete has hardened. Curing of concrete shall 
be carried out by wetting of formwork before removal. After its removal, 
curing shall be done by laying not less than 100 mm thickness of loose 
moistened sand free from clods or gravel, over the concrete. The sand 
shall be kept continuously moist for a period of 7 days. Before backfilling 
is commenced, the loose sand shall be removed and disposed ofas 
directed by the Engineer.
	
vii)	
Normally, open foundations shall be laid dry. Where dewatering is 
necessary for laying of concrete, it shall be carried out adopting any one of 
the following methods or any other method, approved by the Engineer:
	
a)	
A pit or trench of suitable size, deeper than the founding level as necessary, 
is dug beyond the foundation excavation so that the water flows into it 
and the excavated surface at founding level is fully drained.
	
b)	
Water table is depressed by well point system or other methods.
	
c)	
Steel/concrete caissons or sheet piling are used for creating an enclosure 
for the foundations, which can subsequently be dewatered.
	
	
No pumping of water shall be permitted from the time of placing of 
concrete up to 24 hours after placement.
	
viii)	 In situations where foundations cannot be laid dry or where percolation 
is too heavy to keep foundation strata dry, concrete may be laid under 
water only by tremie. In case of flowing water or artesian spring, the 
flow shall be stopped or reduced to the feasible extent at the time of 
placing the concrete.
	
ix)	
Where blasting is required, it shall be carried out in accordance with 
Section 300 of these Specifications, observing all precautions indicated 
therein. Where blasting is likely to endanger adjoining foundations or 
other structures, necessary precautions such as controlled blasting, 
providing rubber mat cover to prevent flying of debris etc., shall be 
taken to prevent any damage.
	
x)	
All spaces excavated and not occupied by the foundations or other 
permanent works shall be refilled with earth up to surface of surrounding 
ground with sufficient allowance for settlement. All backfill shall be 
thoroughly compacted and in general, its top surface shall be neatly 
graded. Backfilling shall be in accordance with Section 300 of these 
Specifications.

In case of excavation in rock, the annular space around the footing shall 
be filled with M15 concrete up to the level of top of rock. Filling with M15 
concrete shall also be carried out for excavations having depth up to 
1.5 m in ordinary rock or 0.6 m in hard rock. In case, the excavations 
are even deeper so as to require further filling up to the level of top of 
rock, the same shall be done by boulders grouted with cement.

Section 2300
Concrete Superstructure
678
Pre-cambering of the superstructure during construction shall be done in such a manner that 
the finally constructed structure under permanent load attains the final profile intended in the 
drawings.
2305.3.1	
Grades of Concrete
Minimum grades of concrete, minimum cement content, maximum water-cement ratio and 
other durability requirements shall be as indicated in Tables 1700-2 and 1700-3 of these 
Specifications.
2305.3.2	
Precasting
All sides, bottom inside and header forms shall be of steel. Forms shall be of sufficient 
thickness, with adequate external bracing and shall be stiffened and adequately anchored 
to withstand the forces due to placement and vibration of concrete. Compaction of concrete 
may be achieved through needle vibrators or form vibrators along with needle vibrators.
For casting of precast segments, any of the two commonly used techniques of precasting viz. 
Long Line method or Short Bench method may be used. After the first segment of each unit is 
cast, succeeding segments shall be match cast against the previous ones and shall be given 
a unique identification mark so that it is placed at the intended locations in the superstructure. 
A bond breaking material such as flax, soap, talc, wax or any other approved material shall 
be used between previously cast segment and newly cast segments, as well as the end 
headers, where required.
Segments shall not be moved from the casting yard until stipulated strength requirements 
have been met. They shall be supported in a manner that will minimize warping. Under all 
circumstances, the concrete shall have attained a minimum compressive strength of 20 MPa 
at the time of removal of forms. At the time of lifting and assembly of precast segments, the 
concrete shall have attained sufficient strength to withstand the handling stresses. Curing of 
segments may be achieved through water curing or steam curing followed by water curing. 
Approved curing compound may also be used.
In case of spliced girder system, match casting is not necessary because the gap between the 
girder segments is filled with concrete or epoxy material at the location of splices. The faces 
which are required to receive the cast-in-situ stitch concrete, shall be adequately roughened 
and prepared as construction joint before pouring the stitch concrete. In case of epoxy jointed 
spliced girder system (with no gap between the girder segments), match casting shall be 
resorted to and all provisions of epoxy jointed segmental structure shall apply.

Shear Keys
Shear keys covering as much area of the cross-section as possible, shall be provided at 
match cast joints of precast segments. Shear keys in the webs shall be smaller in size and 
more in number than those in top flange and bottom flange, which may have larger sizes 
and lesser numbers. Shear keys shall be dimensioned in the form of trapezium and shall 
be located away from tendon holes. In case of spliced girder superstructure, where match 
casting is not used, large amplitude shear keys may be used.
2305.3.5	
Epoxy Jointing of Segments
For epoxy jointed superstructure, mating surfaces of both adjoining segments shall be 
effectively prepared by wire brushing, water jetting or any other approved means to ensure 
that bond breaking material is completely removed. Epoxy of about 1 mm thickness shall 
be applied (usually by hand) on each of the mating surfaces. The epoxy should not have 
crossed 70 percent of its shelf life at the time of application. The segments shall then be 
brought in contact and an axial temporary compression of at least 0.3 MPa shall be applied 
by approved means for a minimum of 24 hours. The erection system shall be so planned by 
the Contractor that the time elapsed between mixing of components of epoxy and application 
of temporary axial surface, does not exceed 60 minutes. No epoxy from a batch for which the 
time since combining the components, has exceeded 20 minutes, shall be used.

2305.3.5.1	
Sequence of Operation
The broad sequence of operations shall generally comprise placing of all segments which 
are to be assembled and prestressed in one stage touching each other and then visually 
examining the matching of mating surfaces. Subsequently, each segment shall be separated 
from adjoining segment by a distance just sufficient to enable application of the epoxy. 
The temporary axial compression shall then be imparted and maintained for a minimum of 
24 hours.
Thereafter, intended permanent prestress shall be imparted prior to demobilizing the 
temporary axial prestress.
2305.3.5.2	
Epoxy
Depending on the ambient temperature range, the following types of epoxies may be used: 
	
5º to 20º Celsius	 	
:	
Fast reacting
	
15º to 30º Celsius	
:	
Medium fast reacting
	
25º to 40º Celsius	
:	
Slow reacting
Resin, which is one component of the epoxy, must be stirred by a mixer in its container for 
about 10 seconds or until homogeneity is achieved. Thereafter, the hardener which is the 
second component, must be added and mixing continued. For a mix of 5 kg batch, a mixing 
rotor attached to 350 W, 400 rpm electric hand drilling machine may be used. The speed 
of revolution should not exceed 400 rpm in order to avoid entrapment of air and excessive 
frictional heat leading to shorter pot life. The mixing time should not exceed 3 minutes. For 
fast reacting and medium fast reacting formulations, the temperature should not be allowed 
to rise above 40ºC while for slow reacting formulations, it should not rise above 60ºC. The 
mixing paddles should scrape the bottom and sides of the container so as to ensure complete 
mixing of the two components. The mixing should be carried out as close as possible to the 
site where the epoxy is to be used, so as to avoid loss of time and wastage of pot life in 
transport.
Epoxy shall be tested for its conformance to the FIP-1978 “Proposal for Standard Tests and 
Verification of Epoxy Bonding Agents for Segmental Construction”. Some of the important 
properties of epoxy (minimum values) are as follows:
	
Pot life	
:	 20 minutes at upper temperature limit
	
Open time	
:	 60 minutes at upper temperature limit
	
Compressive strength

Cast In-Situ Concrete Pour
In every unit of superstructure, consisting of precast segments, there shall be suitable 
numbers (at least one) cast in-situ concrete pour/stitch so as to ensure longitudinal alignment 
of the segment.
2305.3.7	
Spliced Girder System
Spliced girder system in which smaller segments, usually pre-tensioned at precasting yard, 
are assembled together using cast in-situ concrete or epoxy and post tensioned, may be 
used to obtain large girder spans. For this purpose, the girder segments are temporarily 
supported over centering/steel tower or assembled at ground level and then post tensioned 
after jointing. In case of superstructures curved in plan, straight girder segments are placed 
along the chord line of the curvature to obtain the required geometry. In such cases, it is 
necessary to provide a cast in-situ cross diaphragm at each such kink in plan coinciding with 
the splice. The splicing can be done either before casting the deck or along with the deck. In 
the former case, post tensioning is imparted to the girder section alone whereas in the latter 
case, the post tensioning is imparted to the composite section.
A preferred location of splice will be the points of minimum stress such as one-third span 
points. At each cast in-situ splice location, adequately designed untensionsed reinforcement 
shall be provided by lapping, welding or use of mechanical couplers subject to the limitation 
of the relevant codes. However, in case of epoxy jointed splice, such reinforcement is not 
provided.
2305.3.8	
Prestressing Ducts
In the case of dry jointed segments, the prestressing ducts shall necessarily be of HDPE. 
In the case of epoxy jointed segments, either metallic or HDPE ducts may be used. The 
ducts shall be corrugated and shall have size and thickness as per the provisions of Clause 
1802.2.2 of these Specifications. Adequate precaution shall be taken to ensure that epoxy 
material does not leak into the joints of the ducts.

Prestressing Couplers
In case prestressing couplers are used, in general, not more than 50 percent of the 
prestressing cables passing through a section shall be coupled at that section. Longitudinally 
the couplers shall be staggered by at least a distance equal to segment length or twice 
the overall depth of girder, whichever is more. Usual practice is to couple half the cables in 
one span and the other half in the next span and so on. Two immediately adjacent cables 
shall not be provided with couplers at one section.
2305.4	
Precast Pre-Tensioned Girders
Precast pre-tensioned girders can be used for superstructure of bridges in association with 
cast in-situ/precast deck slabs and diaphragms. They can also be made continuous either 
through untensioned reinforcement at the intermediate support or through post tensioning.
All construction requirements of precast pre-tensioned girders shall be in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 1800 of these Specifications.
2306	
CAST  IN-PLACE  VOIDED  SLABS
Voided slabs can be either in reinforced concrete or in prestressed concrete.
Voids can be either circular or rectangular in shape. Void formers may be manufactured 
from steel sheets, fibre reinforced cement, expanded polystyrene, HDPE, etc. They are 
generally corrugated to attain sufficient rigidity in order to prevent distortion or collapse during 
concreting. They should also be leak tight.
Void formers shall be suitably tied down in order to prevent flotation during concreting. Care 
shall be taken during placement of concrete to ensure that the concrete flows fully into the 
space beneath the void formers.

Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation
Section 2400
687
2401	
DESCRIPTION
2401.1	
The work shall cover investigation to determine the suitability or otherwise 
of the soil or rock to support the foundations of the bridge or other structure and also to 
determine soil parameters and rock characteristics required for the design of foundations 
by in-situ testing or testing of samples/cores taken from bores/drill holes. The subsurface 
investigation shall be carried out in such a way that the profiles of different types of soil for the 
entire length of the proposed structure are obtained and recorded. Other information to be 
obtained are mechanical and physical properties such as grain-size distribution, sensitivity, 
existence of deleterious material in soil or ground water, porosity of rock,  subsidence due 
to mining, ground water level, artesian condition, likely sinking and driving effort and likely 
constructional difficulties.
2401.2	
The field work shall consist of excavation, drilling of boreholes for the 
purpose of collection of undisturbed and disturbed samples, standard penetration tests, in-
situ vane tests, static and dynamic cone penetration tests, other field tests, as specified by 
the Engineer and preparation of bore logs.  It will also include collection, preservation and 
testing of disturbed and undisturbed samples from boreholes, borrow pits, etc. as specified 
by the Engineer. All in-situ tests shall be supplemented by laboratory investigations. Relevant 
Indian Standards such as IS:1498, IS:1888, IS:1892, IS:2131, IS:2132, IS:2720, IS:4434 and 
IS:4968 and Annex 2 of IRC:78 shall be followed for guidance.
2401.3	
The soundings by dynamic method, where required shall be carried out in 
bore holes using a standard sampler as specified in IS:2131.
2402	
EXTENT  AND  NUMBER  OF  BORES
2402.1	
Investigations shall cover the entire length of the bridge and also extend on 
either side for a distance about twice the depth below bed of the last main foundation. Bores 
shall be taken at the location of each pier and abutment of the bridge. A minimum of two 
bores shall be taken in the approaches on either side, along the centre line of the alignment, 
at a distance of 50 m and 120 m behind the abutment positions. In case of viaducts in 
the approaches on either side of the bridge, bores shall be taken at the location of each 
foundation of the viaduct spans.
2402.2	
Where detailed investigation indicates appreciable variation or where 
variations in a particular foundation are likely to appreciably affect the construction (specially 
in case of bridge foundations resting on rock), it will be necessary to take additional bores in 
the transverse direction also, to establish complete profile of the underlying strata. The number 
of additional bores shall be decided depending upon the extent of variation in local geology 
at a particular foundation location and should cover the entire area of that foundation.

2403	
DEPTH  OF  BORES
2403.1	
The bores shall be taken below the proposed founding level to a depth of at 
least 1½ times the width of foundation. In case the soil at that level is found to be unsuitable 
or of doubtful bearing capacity, the depth of investigation below the proposed founding level, 
shall be extended to 4 times the width of foundation or till firm and stable soil or rock is met 
with. If rock is met with, the depth of drilling into rock having RQD more than 75, may be 
limited to 3 metres.
2403.2	
For embankments and guide bunds, the depth of bore should cover all 
strata likely to cause undesirable settlement affecting their stability. The depth of bore holes 
below the ground level may ordinarily be 2.5 times the maximum height of the embankment/ 
guide bund, subject to a minimum of 20 m. However, borings can be terminated at shallower 
depths when firm strata or bed rock is encountered. Where highly compressible strata are 
encountered, the boring may have to be taken deeper. In order to ensure that firm strata is 
sufficiently thick, the boring should extend 3 metres into the firm strata.
2404	
DETAILED  INVESTIGATION
2404.1	
The subsurface investigation for bridges shall be carried out in the following 
three zones:
	
i)	
between bed level and up to anticipated maximum scour depth 
(below H.F.L.)
	
ii)	
from the maximum scour depth to the founding level
	
iii)	
from founding level to a depth of about 1½ times the width of the 
foundation
The data required to be obtained from each zone will cover soil classification, particle size 
distribution, shearing strength characteristics, compressibility and permeability as detailed in 
Table 1 of Annex 2 of IRC:78.In all cases, samples of soils shall be collected at every 1 m to 
1.5 m depth or at change of strata.
2404.2	
For high embankments, the average sheer stress of each strata below 
ground level and compressibility of clayey strata, if present, shall be ascertained. The location 
and depth of bore for undisturbed sampling, shall be such as to give information regarding 
boundaries of the various strata. At least one representative undisturbed sample should be 
collected from each strata. When the homogeneous strata is very thick, one representative 
sample shall be collected for each 3 m thickness of the strata.
2404.3	
Whenever a change in the subsoil strata/rock profile is encountered during 
construction, further investigations shall be carried out to establish the correct data required 
for revised design of foundations, if necessary.

2404.4	
Logging of bore holes by radioactive methods for detailed investigations, if 
required, shall be done as specified in the contract or in special provisions.
2404.5	
For bridge works, the investigations shall be comprehensive enough to give 
the following information to the designer:
	
i)	
the engineering properties of the soil/rock,
	
ii)	
the location and extent of soft layers, cavities and gas pockets, if any,

DETAILED  INVESTIGATION  FOR  BRIDGE  FOUNDATIONS  RESTING 
ON  ROCK
2405.1	
Investigation and interpretation of data of rock strata, is a specialised 
work for which the services of an engineering geologist shall be availed of. To arrive at the 
characteristic strength of rock mass, reliance shall be placed more on in-situ tests than on 
laboratory tests.
2405.2	
Identification and classification of rock types for engineering purposes may 
in general be limited to broad, basic geological classes in accordance with accepted practice. 
Strength of parent rock alone is of limited value because overall characteristics depend to a 
large extent on character, spacing and distribution of discontinuities such as joints, bedding 
planes, faults and weathered seams in the rock mass. An important factor affecting the 
behaviour of the rock is the weathered zone at top.
2405.3	
Basic Information Required from Investigations
	
i)	
Geological system
	
ii)	
Depth of rock strata and its variation over the length of the bridge

vi)	
Properties of rock material – strength, geological formation, etc.
	
vii)	
Colour, quality and quantity of water coming out of drill holes
	
viii)	 Erodability of rock to the extent possible, where relevant
2405.4	
Extent of Investigation
2405.4.1	
The extent of investigation shall be adequate enough to cover the whole 
area of the bridge site for general characteristics and in particular, the foundation locations, to 
obtain definite information regarding depth of rock and its variation over the foundation area. 
A complete picture of the rock profile both in depth and across the channel width is necessary 
to assess the constructional difficulties in reaching the founding levels.
2405.4.2	
The depth of boring in rock depends primarily on local geology, erodibility 
of the rock and extent of structural loads coming on the foundations. Normally, the bore 
shall pass through the upper weathered or otherwise weak zone and to sufficient depth to 
distinguish an isolated boulder from a continuous rock formation.
2405.5	
Drilling through rock is a very specialised work requiring careful noting and 
recording of every change that occurs during drilling. The time required to drill through a 
certain depth, amount of core recovery, physical condition, length of pieces of core, joints, 
colour of water residue, weathering and evidence of disturbance and other effects shall be 
carefully noted and entered in the drilling log. For guidance, IS:5313 may be referred. The 
data shall be recorded in accordance with IS:4464. The cores shall be stored properly in 
accordance with IS:4078.
2405.6	
Core Recovery and Rock Quality Designation
The quality of rock cores shall be classified according to Rock Quality Designation as given 
in Table 2400-1.

2405.7	
The rock cores obtained shall be subjected to the following tests:
	
i)	
Visual identification for texture, structure, composition, colour and grain 
size.
	
ii)	
Laboratory tests for specific gravity, porosity and moisture content.
2405.8	
In-situ tests shall be carried out for measuring strength and deformation 
characteristics. The in-situ tests shall be in accordance with IS:7292; IS:7317; and IS:7746. 
Bore hole photography will also be desirable to evaluate the presence of faults, fissures or 
cavities, etc. In addition, laboratory tests can also be made on samples.
2405.9	
Special Cases
2405.9.1	
Investigation for Conglomerate
A drill hole shall be made same as for rock. The samples collected shall be subjected to suitable 
tests depending on the material. Care shall be taken to ascertain erodibility of the matrix. 
Where possible, especially for shallow foundation, Plate Load Test shall be conducted.
2405.9.2	
Investigation for Laterites
The investigation shall be generally similar to that required for cohesive soils. Use of 
penetration tests shall be preferred, if suitable correlation charts are available. These may 
be static or dynamic penetration tests or vane shear tests. In the case of hard laterite, core 
drilling as for soft rocks may have to be resorted to. For laterites at shallow depths, use of 
Plate Load Test may be advantageous.
2405.10	
Caution
2405.10.1	
The interpretation of laboratory results on rock samples depends upon 
the relationship of the specimens tested to the overall rock characteristics, enumerated in 
Annex 2 of IRC:78. For this purpose, care shall be exercised in the choice of specimen size 
and its orientation in relation to the joint pattern.
2405.10.2	
In some cases, the foundation behaviour will be dominated by a possible 
mode of failure involving movement along some joint planes, fissures or weak layer within 
a generally strong rock system and also by possible weathering. In-situ shear tests may be 
conducted wherever feasible, as such tests are likely to give more representative data than 
the shear tests conducted on core samples.

BORING
Boring shall be done by any of the following methods depending on the soil type and types 
of samples required for the investigation.
	
i)	
Auger Boring
	
ii)	
Shell and Auger Boring
	
iii)

Rotary Boring
For detailed subsurface investigation, only rotary drills shall be used. Casing shall also be 
invariably provided with diameters not less than 150 mm up to the level of rock, if any. Use of 
percussion or wash boring equipment shall be permitted only to penetrate through bouldery 
or gravelly strata for progressing the boring but not for the collection of samples. While 
conducting detailed borings, the resistance to the speed of drilling i.e. rate of penetration, 
core loss, etc., as specified in Annex-2 of IRC:78 shall be carefully recorded to evaluate the 
different types of strata and specially to distinguish sand from sandstone, clay from shale, 
etc.
2407	
RECORDS  OF  BORINGS  AND  TRIAL  PITS
2407.1	
The field records for the preliminary and detailed investigation shall contain 
the date when the boring was made, the location of the boring with reference to a permanent 
system of co-ordinates and the elevation of the ground surface with respect to a permanent

of each of the successive soil strata were encountered, the investigator’s classification 
of the layer on the basis of general information obtained from field examination (refer to 
Appendix 2.1 of IRC:75) and the value of the resistance obtained by means of Standard 
Penetration Test. The type of tools used for borings shall be recorded. If the tools were 
changed at any stage, the depth at which the change was made and the reason therefore 
shall also be noted. Incomplete and abandoned borings shall be described with no less 
care than successfully completed ones. The notes shall contain everything of significance 
observed on the job such as the elevation at which wash water was lost from the hole.

PROCEDURE  FOR  TAKING  SAMPLES
2409.1	
For proper identification of subsurface material, sample should be recovered 
containing all the constituents of the materials in their proper proportion. In clayey deposits, 
such samples could be collected by split spoon samplers. In sandy deposits, sampling 
spoons shall be fitted with suitable devices for retaining samples. All data required for soil 
identification (Appendix-2.1 of IRC:75) should be collected from the samples so extracted 
when undisturbed samples, are not available. Penetration test should be carried out with 
the standard splitspoon sampler or penetrometers if the soil is coarse grained. If the soil 
profile is known to be fairly regular, preliminary and detailed investigation may be combined. 
Tube samplers can be used in place of split spoon samplers for collecting samples in clayey 
strata.
2409.2	
Disturbed Soil Samples
2409.2.1	
Disturbed samples of soil shall be obtained in the course of excavation and 
boring. For procuring samples from below the ground water level, where possible, special 
type of sampler shall be used. Where Standard Penetration Test is conducted, representative 
samples shall be obtained from the split spoon. While collecting disturbed samples from 
borrow areas it shall be ensured that the samples collected represent all types of borrow 
materials to be used in the construction of embankment and subgrade.
2409.2.2	
The size of sample generally required shall be as given in Table 2400-2.

2409.2.3	
While taking out disturbed soil samples, Standard Penetration Test may also 
be conducted to find out the bearing capacity of the subsoils at specified levels.
2409.3	
Undisturbed Soil Samples
2409.3.1	
The location of the bore-hole shall be as indicated on the drawing or given 
by the Engineer. The depth of the bore-hole shall be as indicated on the drawing or shall be 
governed by the criteria given therein or as directed by the Engineer.
2409.3.2	
Samples shall be obtained in such a manner that their moisture content and 
structure do not get altered. This may be ensured by use of correctly designed sampler and 
by careful preservation and packing.
2409.3.3	
Standard Penetration Test may have to be conducted in each case to obtain 
additional data as directed by the Engineer. In soft clay, in-situ vane shear test as per IS:4434 
may have to be conducted. Where all the three operations have to be carried out in one layer, 
the sequence shall be as follows: undisturbed soil sampling, in-situ vane shear test, Standard 
Penetration Test.
2409.3.4	
For compression test samples, a core of 40 mm diameter and about 150 to 
200 mm length may be sufficient, but for other laboratory tests, a core of 100 mm diameter 
and 300 mm length shall be taken unless otherwise specified by the Engineer.
2409.3.5	
The upper few millimeters of both types of sample shall be removed as the 
soil at the bottom of the bore hole usually gets disturbed by the boring tools.
2409.4	
Rock Samples
2409.4.1	
Disturbed Samples
The sludge from percussion borings or from rotary borings which have failed to yield a core, 



======================================================================
PAGE 715 of 903
======================================================================
Section 2400
Surface and Subsurface Geotechnical Investigation
696
shall be collected to serve as a disturbed sample. It may be recovered by settlement of 
circulating water in a trough.
2409.4.2	
Undisturbed Samples
Block samples taken from the rock formation shall be dressed to a size of about 
90 mm x 75 mm x 50 mm.
Cores of rock shall be taken by means of rotary drills fitted with a coring bit with core retainer, 
if warranted.
2409.4.3	
In case rock is met with at shallow depths, test pits or trenches may be 
dug. These are most dependable since they permit a direct examination of the surface, the 
weathered zone and discontinuities, if any. It is also possible to take representative samples 
for tests. For guidance, IS:4453 may be referred.
2410	
Preservation,  Handling  and  Labelling  of  Samples
2410.1	
The samples shall be labelled and handled carefully so that they are received 
in the laboratory in a fit state for examination and testing and can be correctly identified as 
coming from a specified trial pit or bore.
2410.2	
The disturbed material in the upper end of the tube shall be completely 
removed before applying wax for sealing. The length and type of material so removed should 
be recorded.
2410.3	
The soil at the lower end of the tube shall be reamed for a length of about 
20 mm. After cleaning, both ends shall be sealed with wax applied in such a way that it does 
not enter the sample. Wax used for sealing should not be heated to more than a few degrees 
above its melting temperature. The empty space in the samplers, if any, should be filled with 
moist soil or saw dust and the ends covered with tight fitting caps.
2410.4	
Labels Giving the Following Information Should be Affixed to the Tubes:

TESTS FOR INVESTIGATION OF SHALLOW FOUNDATIONS OF 
BRIDGES
2411.1	
Digging of test pits or trenches is the most dependable method of investigation, 
since it permits direct and reliable visual examination of the type of soil and its stratification. 
In-situ tests like plate bearing tests, shear tests and uni-axial jacking tests can also be 
conveniently carried out in the test pits.
2411.2	
Tests shall be conducted on undisturbed samples, which may be obtained 
from open pits. The use of Plate Load Test (as per IS:1888) is considered desirable to 
ascertain the safe bearing capacity and settlement characteristics. A few exploratory bore 
holes or soundings extending to a depth of about 1½ times the proposed width of foundation 
shall also be made to ascertain whether there is any weak strata underlying the foundation.
The results of laboratory tests shall be correlated with those of in-situ tests like Plate Load 
Tests and Penetration Test.
2412	
TESTS  FOR  INVESTIGATION  FOR  DEEP  FOUNDATIONS  OF 
BRIDGES
2412.1	
The tests to be conducted for obtaining the properties of soil are different for 
cohesive soils and for cohensionless soils. These are enumerated below and shall be carried 
out, wherever practicable, according to soil type. While selecting the tests and interpreting 
the results, limitation of applicability of particular tests shall be taken into account. A most 
suitable and appropriate combination of tests shall be chosen, depending on the properties 
needed for design and constructional aspects.

For both cohesionless and cohesive soils where dewatering is expected, 
permeability tests may be conducted as per IS:2720 Part XVII.
2412.2	
The subsoil water shall be tested for chemical properties to ascertain 
whether there is any hazard which may cause deterioration of concrete in foundations. 
Where dewatering is expected to be required, permeability characteristics shall also be 
determined.
2413	
TESTING OF MATERIAL FOR FOUNDATIONS OF GUIDE BUNDS AND 
HIGH  EMBANKMENTS
2413.1	
The soil properties of the embankment foundation shall be got verified prior 
to start of construction in order to ascertain whether they conform to the requirements as 
specified in particular specifications. In case they do not, then the embankment design will 
have to be got revised.
2413.2	
In addition to the relevant identification tests, mentioned in IRC:75, it shall be 
necessary to conduct some of the following tests on the undisturbed samples collected from

Section 2500
River Training and Protection Work 
708
Wire crates for shallow or accessible situations shall be 3 m x 1.5 m x 1.25 m in size. Where 
these have to be deposited and there is a possibility of overturning, the crate shall be divided 
into 1.5 m compartments by cross netting.
For deep or inaccessible situations, wire crates can be made smaller subject to the approval 
of the Engineer.
Wire crates built in-situ, shall not be larger than 7.5 m x 3 m x 0.6 m, nor smaller than 
2 m x 1 m x 0.3 m. Sides of large crates shall be securely stayed at intervals of not more than 
1.50 m to prevent bulging.
The netting shall be made by fixing a row of spikes on a beam at a spacing equal to the 
mesh. The beam must be a little longer than the width of netting required. The wire is to be 
cut to lengths about three times the length of the net required. Each piece shall be bent at the 
middle around one of the spikes and the weaving commenced from the corner.
A double twist shall be given at each intersection. The twisting shall be carefully done by 
means of a strong iron bar, five and half turns being given to the bar at each splice.
The bottom and two ends of the crate or mattress shall be made at one time. The other two 
sides shall be made separately and shall be secured to the bottom and the ends by twisting 
adjacent wires together. The top shall be made separately and shall be fixed in the same 
manner as the sides after the crates or mattress have been filled.
2503.3.3	
Laying of Wire Crates
Wherever possible, crates shall be placed in position before filling with boulders. Undulations 
in the bed shall be levelled prior to placement of wire crate units. The crates shall be filled by 
carefully hand-packing the boulders as tightly as possible and not by merely throwing in the 
stones or boulders.
Where the crates are to be laid on the sides and bed of the stream in underwater conditions, 
they shall be prefilled on dry area, lifted by cranes using suitable size frames with lifting slings 
at every 0.5 m to 1 m maximum spacing and placed at designated locations. Sacrificial steel 
rods of diameter 20 mm to 25 mm may also be used, in place of frame, by tying them to the 
edges and lifting directly with closely spaced slings. Once placed, divers shall lace the crates 
together at all contact surfaces. For sides of the banks a tilting platform, pantoon or barge 
can be used where mattresses are filled with stones on the level platform, resting at one end 
on the bank and has the other edge hinged to the pantoon/barge. One end of the filled wire 
crate is anchored to the dry edge of the slope and then the pantoon/barge is moved away

is perpendicular to the face of the slope, unless such dimension is greater than the specified 
thickness of pitching.
The largest stones shall be placed in the bottom courses and for use as headers for subsequent 
courses.
In hand placed pitching, the stone of flat stratified nature should be placed with the principal 
bedding plane normal to the slope. The pattern of laying shall be such that the joints are 
broken and voids are minimum by packing with spalls, wherever necessary, and the top 
surface is as smooth as possible.
When full depth of pitching can be formed with a single stone, the stones shall be laid breaking 
joints and all interstices between adjacent stones shall be filled in with spalls of the proper 
size wedged in with hammers to ensure tight packing.
When two or more layers of stones must be laid to obtain the design thickness of pitching, 
dry masonry shall be used and stones shall be well bonded. To ensure regular and orderly 
disposition of the full intended quantity of stone as shown, template cross walls in dry masonry 
shall be built about a metre wide and to the full height of the specified thickness at suitable 
intervals all along the length and width of the pitching. Within these walls the stones shall be 
hand packed as specified.

Terminology
Double twisted wire mesh: a non-ravelling mesh made by twisting continuous pairs of wires 
through three one-half turns (commonly called double-twisted) to form hexagonal shaped 
openings which are then interconnected to adjacent wires to form hexagonal openings.
Gabion: a double-twisted wire mesh container of variable sizes, uniformly partitioned into 
internal cells, inter-connected with other similar units, and filled with stone at the project 
site to form flexible, permeable monolithic structures for earth retaining and erosion control 
projects (Fig. 1).
Revet Mattress: a double-twisted wire mesh container uniformly partitioned into internal cells 
with relatively smaller height in relation to other dimensions, having smaller mesh openings 
than the mesh used for gabions; revet mattresses are generally used for riverbank protection 
and channel linings (Fig. 2).
Selvedge Wire: a terminal wire used to edge the wire mesh perpendicular to the double twist 
by mechanically wrapping the mesh wires around it at least 2.5 times (Fig. 3).
Edge Wire: a terminal wire of the same diameter as the selvedge wire used to edge the wire 
mesh parallel to the double twist by continuously weaving it mechanically into the wire mesh 
(Fig. 3).
Lacing Wire: a galvanized wire or galvanized wire with PVC coating used to assemble and 
interconnect empty units, to close and secure stone-filled units, and for internal stiffeners 
(Fig. 4).
Diaphragm: an internal partition made of same double twisted wire mesh panel in a gabion/
revet mattress that is attached to the bottom, the sides, and, after the gabion cage is packed 
with stones, to the lid of the cage (Fig. 1).
Bracing Wire: a length of galvanized wire or galvanized wire with PVC coating used for 
support of facing by connecting the front panel to the back panel of a gabion and having the 
same diameter as the lacing wire (Fig. 5).

stiffeners shall be certified by the steel wire/ PVC Coated steel wire 
producers for conformance to the requirements of Para 3 above.
	
ii)	
A minimum of three tests each for conformance to strength of galvanized 
steel wire mesh parallel to twist and perpendicular to twist shall be 
performed. A retest for conformance with the aforementioned strength 
tests shall be required when changes of the physical characteristics of 
the mesh products occur. For galvanized steel wire with PVC coating, 
the same requirements as for the galvanized steel wire mesh shall be 
followed. The results of all three tests must meet the requirements of 
Table-2500/1.
5	
Test Methods
5.1	
Tensile Strength of Wire Mesh Panel
The wire mesh specimens shall be representative of proper field construction as to materials, 
mesh geometry, and workmanship, and shall be as large as practical to minimize the effect 
of variations. The tests shall be run with the load applied parallel to the axis of the twist and 
repeated on a separate test specimen with the load applied perpendicular to the axis of the 
twist.
Place the mesh into the machine grips such that the gripped mesh will be maintained in the 
mesh geometry characteristic of field use. The specimen of approximately 0.8 m width and 
0.5 m height shall be tested. The effective width to be considered for test specimen shall be 
the distance between two extreme gripping points. The specimen should extend by at least 
one mesh repetition beyond the extreme gripping points on either side. However, specimen 
should not extend more than two mesh repetitions beyond extreme gripping points. The 
mesh shall be pre-loaded to 10 percent of the specified minimum strength and machine head 
travel stopped. The mesh gauge dimensions shall be recorded at this time and taken as the 
initial dimensions of the specimen where such dimensions are required. If the sample slips 
at any of the gripping point during the test, such a test shall be discarded and a new sample 
shall be taken. The loading shall then continue uniformly maintaining the displacement rate of 
75 to 100 mm per minute, until first fracture or unwrapping of an individual wire in the system 
occurs. The distortion of the mesh or changes in gauge length shall be measured to accuracy 
consistent with reporting the percent elongation to the nearest 0.5 percent.
5.2	
Punch Test
The punch test could be done using two different apparatus.
	
i)	
Pre-Tensioned Punch Test
	
	
An uncut section of 1.82 m in length (unselvedged) and not less than 
0.91 m in width shall have the ends securely clamped for 0.91 m along 



======================================================================
PAGE 738 of 903
======================================================================
River Training and Protection Work 
Section 2500
719
the width of the sample. When the width of the section under test exceeds 
0.91 m, the clamps shall be centered along the width and the excess 
width will be allowed to fall free on each side of the clamped section. 
The sample shall then be subjected to tension sufficient to cause 10 % 
elongation of the sample section between the clamps. After elongation 
and while clamped as described above (and otherwise unsupported), 
the section shall be subjected to a load over 960 cm2 of area applied to 
the approximate center of the sample section between the clamps and 
in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the tension force.
	
ii)	
Secured Punch Test
	
	
An uncut section of 1.24 m in length and not less than 0.9 m in width 
(selvedged), including all selvedge bindings, shall have the sides and 
the ends securely clamped at every mesh opening to a rigid frame. 
After being secured as described above, the section shall be subjected 
to a load over 960 cm2 applied to the approximate center of the sample 
section between the clamps and in a direction perpendicular to the 
direction of the tension force.
	
	
The sample shall withstand, without rupture of any strand or opening 
of any mesh fastening, an actual load applied by means of a circular 
ram at a uniform rate not to exceed 220 N/s equalling or exceeding 
the values shown in Table-2500/1. The ram head used in the test shall 
be circular with a 350 mm diameter and have its edges bevelled or 
rounded to prevent cutting of the wire strands.
	
iii)	
Pull-Apart Resistance Test
	
	
A set of two identical rectangular gabion panels, each with a width about 
10
1
2  mesh openings along a selvedge wire, shall be joined by properly 
installed wire fasteners along the two selvedge wires so that each 
fastener confines two selvedge and two mesh wires. If the fasteners 
are also to be used to join two individual empty gabion baskets, two 
additional selvedge wires that are each mechanically wrapped with 
mesh wires shall be included so that each fastener confines four

INSTALLATION  OF  EXPANSION  JOINTS
2610.1	
General Procedure
	
i)	
Expansion Joints shall be installed under close supervision of the 
manufacturer’s/supplier’s engineer in order to ensure the quality of 
installation and its function as intended during the entire life span. 
Detailed Installation Manual shall be supplied by the manufacturer/
supplier.
	
ii)	
The dimensions of the recess in the deck shall be established in 
accordance with the drawings or design data of the manufacturer, 
taking into account the width of gap for movement of the joint.
	
iii)	
The pre-setting of expansion joint shall be done by means of an auxiliary 
construction.
	
iv)	
The road surfacing/wearing coat shall be laid before commencing 
installation of joint. Before laying wearing coat, the recess portion shall 
be filled with sand and wearing coat shall be laid in a continuous manner 
over the deck slabs and recess portion. Prior to installation of the joints, 
portion of wearing coat over the recess shall be removed by a suitable 
method e.g. saw cutting and the infill sand shall also be removed.
	
v)	
Preparation of the Recess : The size and form of recess shall suit the 
geometry of the expansion joint. However, the width shall not be less 
than the specified value for a particular type of joint. In order to avoid 
difficulties during installation, the following points must be checked and 
considered:
	
a)	
Dimension of recess
	
b)	
Levels
	
c)	
Skew and slope
	
d)	
Designed gap between bridge deck and abutment and/or between 
adjoining decks
	
e)	
Existing structural reinforcement according to the drawings
	
	
Reinforcing bars that would obstruct the installation of expansion joint 
shall be bent to accommodate the expansion joint anchorages. Cutting 
off or removal of interfering reinforcing bars shall only be done after 
consultation with the Engineer.



======================================================================
PAGE 756 of 903
======================================================================
Expansion Joints
Section 2600
737
	
	
The recess shall be cleaned thoroughly. If necessary, the surface 
should be roughened. All loose dirt and debris shall be removed by 
wire brushing, air blowing and dried with hot compressed air.
	
vi)	
Shuttering : Shuttering must be used to seal the space between the 
underside of the joint and the vertical face of the recess. The shuttering 
must be fitted in such a way that it forms an appropriate seal against 
the edge of the recess. The recess shall be shuttered in such a way 
that dimensions shown on the drawing are maintained. The formwork 
shall be rigid and firm.
	
vii)	
Placing in the Recess : Level marks shall be set next to the recess. 
This enables a controlled leveling of the expansion joint. Lowering the 
expansion joint/joint construction/insert into the recess shall be done 
in such a way that the entire length of the joint is evenly lowered into 
the recess. Thereafter, the joint/joint construction/insert is precisely 
leveled and adjusted in the longitudinal, transverse and vertical planes. 
If required, the joint must also be adjusted to the gradient of the final 
surface level.
	
viii)	 Connection
	
a)	
The expansion joint/joint construction/insert shall be installed 
preferably in the early morning when the temperature is distributed 
almost uniformly over the whole bridge. Immediately before 
the installation, the actual temperature of the bridge shall be 
measured. If it is not within the considered tolerance, the preset 
adjustment shall be corrected. The joint/joint construction/insert 
shall be lowered in a predetermined position. Following placement 
of the joint/joint construction/insert in the prepared recess, the 
joint/joint construction/insert shall be leveled and finally aligned 
and the anchorage steel on one side of the joint welded to the 
exposed reinforcement bars of the structure. Upon completion, 
the same procedure shall be followed for the other side. With the 
expansion joint/joint construction/ insert finally held at both sides, 
the auxiliary brackets shall be released, allowing it to take up the 
movement of the structure. After carrying out the final fixing, the 
protection against corrosion shall be completed.
	
b)	
For fully assembled joints with one end fixed and other end 
movable e.g. modular strip/box seal joint, connection shall be as 
detailed below:
	
	
The 1st  side : The fixed side of the assembled joint (either the abutment 
or the bridge deck side) is designated the 1st side for connecting the 
joint. The preliminary fixing is made by evenly placing and welding of 
reinforcing bars over the entire length between the anchor loops and the 



======================================================================
PAGE 757 of 903
======================================================================
Section 2600
Expansion Joints
738
deck reinforcement. To facilitate concreting, it the gap between recess 
and shuttering is sealed by a grout seam. The seam must be left to dry 
prior to final concreting. After this, additional reinforcing bars are welded 
until all anchor loops are firmly connected to the deck reinforcement. 
The expansion joint shall be considered sufficiently fixed when no 
vibration is noted when it is lightly tapped. The expansion joint shall not 
be subjected to any loads that could in any way displace the precise 
location of this fixing.
	
	
The 2nd side : Depending on the size of the expansion joint and the 
expected movement during installation, the most suitable time must be 
determined for fixing of the 2nd (moveable) side. Usually this is the early 
morning hours with the smallest temperature deviations. The procedure 
is identical to that for the 1st side. The joint shall be provisionally fixed 
to the reinforcement as fast as possible.
	
	
Immediately afterwards, the fixation brackets shall be removed. 
Thereafter, the gap between recess and shuttering shall be sealed with 
grout seam and the remaining reinforcing bars welded as described 
previously.
	
ix)	
Concreting
	
a)	
Prior to final concreting, the position of the joint/joint construction/
insert must be recorded. The Engineer must give written 
confirmation of the correct position of the joint and recess 
concreting. The recess shall be thoroughly watered. Before 
pouring the concrete the joint construction should be protected 
by a cover. Controlled concrete having strength not less than that 
in superstructure subject to a minimum of M35, shall be filled into 
the recess. The water cement ratio shall not be more than 0.4. If 
necessary, admixtures may be used to improve workability. The 
concrete must exhibit low shrinkage. The freshly placed concrete 
shall be properly vibrated. Damage to the shuttering shall be 
avoided during vibration. The concrete shall be finished flush with 
the carriageway surfacing. The concrete shall be kept damp until 
it has cured in order to avoid fissures caused by drying too fast. 
After the concrete has cured, the movable installation brackets 
and shuttering still in place shall be removed.
	
b)	
For modular strip seal joint the space beneath the joint boxes shall 
be completely filled with concrete. So that traffic loads are safely 
transmitted into the structure.
	
x)	
As soon as the concrete in the recess has become initially set, a sturdy 
ramp shall be placed over the joint to protect it from traffic at site.

within 24 hours of fixing the steel inserts. In such cases, spacer 



======================================================================
PAGE 761 of 903
======================================================================
Section 2600
Expansion Joints
742
bars should be removed just after concreting is finished. If there 
is a substantial time lag between fixing of inserts and concreting, 
then any one of the following methods shall be adopted, depending 
on the support condition:
	
	
For simply supported bridge resting on simple elastomeric 
bearings, (with no dowel pins), insert shall be placed in position 
with spacer bars at every alternate joints. Such joints shall be 
called restrained joints hereafter. In other words, inserts shall not 
be fixed simultaneously at two ends of one span. If the above 
condition is satisfied, inserts with spacer bars shall be kept in 
position for a substantially longer period at such restrained joints. 
Spacer bars shall be removed after concreting of such restrained 
joints and inserts placed in position with spacer bars at the other 
unrestrained joints thereafter.
	
	
For bridges resting on other than elastomeric bearings (including 
bearings with dowel pins at one end), after placing and aligning the 
inserts and securing the same, the spacer bars shall be removed. 
Concreting shall be done with great care so that inserts are not 
dislocated or distorted.
	
c)	
While removing the spacer bar after concreting, one must take 
care to see that the concrete is not damaged during withdrawal of 
spacer bar. If the spacer bar happens to be snugly fitted, it shall 
not be pulled by any means; it shall be gas cut in two pieces and 
then removed.
	
iii)	
Concreting of Pocket
	
a)	
Concreting of pocket shall be done with great care using proper 
mix conforming to grade similar to that of the deck casting 
besides ensuring efficient bonding between deck and steel insert. 
Also proper care shall be given for ensuring efficient bonding 
with the already cast concrete. Requirement of concrete as per 
Clause 2610.9.1 shall be followed.
	
b)	
Needle vibrators shall be used. Care shall be taken so that the 
position of steel insert is not disturbed during vibration.
	
c)	
Spacer bar shall be removed within an appropriate time before 
the joint is required to permit movement.
	
iv)	
Fixing of Elastomeric Slab Unit (ESU)
	
a)	
Special jig shall be used to preset the ESU during installation
	
b)	
ESU (mounted on the jig, if preset) shall be lowered to position.



======================================================================
PAGE 762 of 903
======================================================================
Expansion Joints
Section 2600
743
	
c)	
The line and level on the ESU should be adjusted.
	
d)	
ESU shall be removed and coated with special adhesive
	
e)	
ESU shall be placed in position again, ensuring waterproof joining 
at required faces.
	
f)	
ESU shall be tightened with stainless steel nuts an lock washers 
in position. Tightened nuts shall be locked with lock washers.
	
g)

h)	
The elastomeric plugs shall be pressed in position after applying 
adhesive on the appropriate surface.
	
i)	
ESU shall be fitted in position after completion of wearing course. 
While completing this part of the wearing course, adequate care 
shall be taken to ensure a waterproof joining with the already 
existing wearing course.
	
v)	
Pre-setting
	
a)	
The main purpose of pre-setting of the steel inserts at the time of 
its installation is to ensure as closely as possible the condition that 
in the long run at the mean average annual temperature, the ESU 
remains at its nominal state.
	
	
The steel insert unit of expansion joint can be fixed in any month of 
the year. The expansion gap between bridge super structures may 
vary from time to time; hence the initial fixing distance between 
fixing points will obviously depend on the month of installation 
of steel insert. The c/c distance between stainless steel fixing of 
bolts as indicated in the drawing can be taken as only nominal. 
The same shall be modified by pre-setting depending on:
	
	
The difference between the mean temperature of the month of 
fixing of steel insert and the annual average temperature, and
	
	
The elapsed period between the casting and/or pre-stressing 
and fixing of steel insert for calculating the remnant creep and 
shrinkage.
	
vi)	
Special Requirements for Installation
	
a)	
The supplier shall provide detailed working drawings showing 
the location of all bolts, recesses and holes necessary for the 
installation of the joint shall be obtained from the supplier before 
construction of bridge deck area adjacent to the joint. If required 
detailing of reinforcing bars in superstructure shall be modified to 
ensure that there will be no interference in the installation of the 
joint.

Precautions for Application
	
a)	
Temperature of components A and B, i.e., resin and hardener shall 
be between 10°C and 35°C at the time of mixing unless otherwise 
specified.
	
b)	
Temperature of structural member during epoxy injection shall be 
between 10°C and 35°C unless otherwise specified.
	
c)	
Immediately prior to use, each component shall be thoroughly mixed 
with a clean paddle. The paddle shall be of a type that does not propel 
air into the material. Separate clean paddle must be used for each 
component.
	
d)	
Any heating of the adhesive components shall be done by application 
of indirect heat, in case the work is to be done in cold climate.
	
e)	
Just before use, the two components shall be thoroughly mixed in the 
ratios specified by the manufacturer. The mixing time shall be strictly in 
accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations. When adhesives 
with different coloured components are mixed, the mixture shall have a 
uniform colour without streaks.
	
f)	
The use of solvents and thinners shall not be permitted except for 
cleaning of equipment.
2803.9	
Testing
2803.9.1 
Material Testing 
Prior to approval of material, the following tests shall be carried out by the Contractor at site 
or in an authorised laboratory for each batch of resin and hardener and each combination.
	
i)	
Viscosity test for resin and hardener and the mix: three specimens 
each.
	
ii)	
Pot life test: three specimens each.
	
iii)	
Bond test: three specimens each.
	
iv)	
Shear test: six specimens each, 3 after 24 hours and the other three 
after 72 hours of curing.
Subsequent tests shall be carried out as directed by the Engineer. Procedure for tests shall 
be as below:
	
i)	
Pot Life Test
	
a)	
500 gm of resin formulation shall be prepared by thoroughly 
mixing 
the 
resin 
and 
hardener /accelerator /catalyst 
component in proposed proportion in a 1 kg capacity hemispheric

porcelain bowl by means of a spatula or any other agitating device 
and time and the ambient temperature noted.
	
b)	
The resin formulation shall be applied with a clean dry 25 mm size 
painter’s brush, on a clean dry surface such as cement concrete 
over 150 mm - 200 mm length, starting immediately after mixing 
the formulation and repeating the operation every five minutes. 
When it becomes just difficult to spread the resin properly with 
the brush, the time is noted. The time elapsed since completion of 
mixing of resin formulation, is taken as its pot life.
	
c)	
One pot life test shall be performed on commencement of work 
and the same shall be repeated every four hours.
	
d)	
In case the material fails to satisfy the pot life test, it shall not be 
used for injection.
	
	
Where the resin and hardener get mixed at point of injection, the pot life 
is not important and no tests may be required.
	
ii)	
Bond Test
	
	
A standard 150 mm diameter and 300 mm long concrete cylinder shall 
be cast in 2 pieces by providing a separating medium at an axis of 
45 degrees to the longer axis of the cylinder as shown in Fig. 1 of 
Appendix 2800/1.
	
	
Three such split cylinders shall be prepared. Two pieces of each cylinder 
shall be joined with epoxy mortar at four points to give a clear gap 
of about 0.2 mm, which will be injected with epoxy resin at site. After 
epoxy has been cured, load test shall be carried out on the cylinder. The 
failure shall not take place at the joint injected with epoxy resin. Also the 
strength of cylinder at failure shall not be less than 80 percent of the 28 
days cube strength of the concrete mix.
	
iii)	
Shear Tests
	
	
Two steel plates, minimum 3 mm thick, shall be bonded with epoxy at 
site using the same resin mix as used/proposed to be used for injection. 
The assembly shall be kept in mechanical clamp till epoxy is cured. A 
total of six specimens shall be prepared for each batch of materials. 
Three test specimens shall then be subjected to a shear force along the 
axis after 24 hours and the minimum shear strength before failure shall 
not be less than 1 MPa (Refer Fig. 2 of Appendix 2800/1).
	
	
The remaining test specimens shall be similarly tested after 72 hours 
of curing. The shear strength before failure shall not be less than 
2.5 MPa.

Core Test  
If directed by the Engineer, cores shall be tested for the acceptance of the work. The selection 
of the location of cores shall be as directed by the Engineer in such a way that damage in 
critical/stressed areas of the structure is avoided.
The Contractor shall obtain 50 mm diameter initial core samples in the first 50 linear metres. 
Thereafter, frequency of core sampling shall be as specified or as agreed by the Engineer. 
The depth of the core shall normally be less than 200 mm.
Tests and Acceptance Criteria shall be as follows:
	
a)	
Penetration- Visual examination of the core should show epoxy adhesive 
filling a minimum of 90 percent of the crack.
	
b)	
Bond Strength- When tested for bond, concrete failure should occur 
before adhesive failure. Also, minimum bond strength of 40 MPa should 
be developed with no failure of either concrete or adhesive.
If the cores taken in first 50 m length pass tests as specified above, epoxy adhesive injection 
work at area represented by cores will be accepted.
If cores fail either by lack of penetration or bond strength, work shall not proceed further until 
the areas represented by the cores are re-injected and re-tested for acceptance.
Filling of Core Holes
Two-component bonding agent shall be applied to surfaces of cored holes followed by filling 
of non-shrink cement grout mix placed by hand trowel, thoroughly rodded and tamped in 
place. The surface shall be finished to match the finish and texture of existing concrete to the 
satisfaction of the Engineer. Materials to be used and procedures for filling core holes shall 
be got approved by the Engineer before proceeding with work.
2803.9.3	
Test for Injection Equipment
At all times during the course of the work, the Contractor shall keep complete and accurate 
records and make available to the Engineer, the results of the pressure and ratio tests 
specified below so that the efficacy and accuracy of the injection equipment is verified.
The Engineer at any time may direct the Contractor to conduct additional tests in his 
presence.

2 minutes.
	
	
The pressure test shall be run for each injection unit at the beginning 
and after break of every shift.
	
b)	
Ratio Test
	
	
The mixing head of the injection equipment shall be disconnected 
and the two adhesive components shall be pumped simultaneously 
through the ratio check device, which shall consist of two independent 
valved nozzles. There shall be a pressure gauge capable of controlling 
back pressure by opening or closing valved nozzles capable of 
sensing the back pressure behind each valve.The discharge pressure 
shall be adjusted to read 5 bar for both adhesive components, 
which shall be simultaneously discharged into separate calibrated 
containers during the same time period. The amounts thus discharged 
shall be compared to determine whether the volume/discharge 
conforms to the manufacturer’s recommended ratio for applicable 
material.

colour. For a total weight of 1kg or less, the components shall be mixed for 3 minutes in a slow 
speed (400-600 rpm) mixer. The stirrer shall be moved up and down and along the sides until 
uniform colour without streaks, is obtained. While stirring, it shall be ensured that excessive 
amount of air is not entrapped. If no power is available, a flat putty knife may be used to reach 
into the corners of the can and hand mixing done for at least 5 minutes.
2804.1.3	
Surface Preparation 
Two general methods of surface preparation shall be followed:
	
a)	
Mechanical that includes grinding, grit blasting, water blasting and 
scarification.
	
b)	
Chemical that includes acid etching with 15 percent by weight of 
hydrochloric solution, followed by repeated flushing with high pressure 
stream of water
Contaminants, such as oil, grease, tar, asphalt, paint, wax, curing compounds, surface; 
impregnants like linseed oil or silicons and laitance, loose material and unsound concrete, 
shall be removed from the surface on which epoxy mortar is to be placed.
2804.1.4	
Application
The epoxy primer coat which acts as a bonding agent, shall consist of resin and hardener 
mixed in the proportions as given by the manufacturer. Epoxy bonding agent shall be applied 
only on a dry surface and shall not be applied when it rains or in standing water. The overlay, 
whether epoxy or cement based, shall be done within the pot life of the epoxy primer coat. 
Epoxy primer coat shall be applied with the help of stiff nylon bristle brushes or hard rubber 
rollers or spray gun, depending upon the nature of surface and extent of work area. As far as 
possible, the coating shall be uniformly thick.
Before the primer coat is fully cured, epoxy mortar shall be applied by means of trowels 
and floats. The interval between the application of primer coat and epoxy mortar shall be 
approximately 15/30 minutes depending upon the ambient temperature.
Seal coat shall be applied 24 hours after curing and mild roughening of the surface of the 
mortar.
2804.1.5	
Coverage
The coverage of resin mix would depend on the system of resin used. However, as a general 
guideline the coverage area shall be as under:
	
a)	
Primer Coat. An area of 3-6 square metres will be covered by 1 kg of 
resin hardener mix, depending on the finish of the concrete.



======================================================================
PAGE 786 of 903
======================================================================
Repair of Structures
Section 2800
767
	
b)	
Epoxy Mortar. One square metre of surface requires approximately 
20-24 kg of epoxy mortar, when laid to a thickness of 10 mm.
	
c)	
Seal Coat. An area of 4 to 6 square metres will be covered by 1 kg 
depending on the temperature of application.
2804.1.6	
Cleaning and Maintenance of Equipment 
Tools and equipment are best cleaned immediately after use since the removal of cured 
resin is difficult and time consuming. The bulk of resin shall be removed using a scraper 
and remainder washed away completely using solvents such as toluene, xylene or acetone. 
Equipment shall always be cleaned before the epoxy hardens. Solvents used for this purpose 
may be Acetone (flammable), Methyl Ethyl Kethone (flammable), Methyl Chloride (non-
flammable). Cured epoxies may be removed using Methylene Chloride
2804.1.7	
Testing
Epoxy used for making mortar shall conform to all requirements and testing procedures as 
laid down in Clause 2803.9.
2804.1.8	
Personnel and Environment Safety
Any skin contact with epoxy materials, solvents and epoxy strippers should be avoided. 
Epoxy resins and particularly epoxy hardeners (B component) may cause a rash on the skin. 
The official toxicity classification on the container labels may be looked at before starting 
work.
Rubber gloves, with a cloth liner, and protective clothing shall be worn. Barrier creams are 
recommended but are not substitutes for protective clothing. Eyes shall be protected where 
splashing could occur while spraying or mixing. Good ventilation shall be ensured and 
inhalation of vapours avoided. If materials are sprayed, a respirator shall be used.
If contact occurs with the skin, it shall be immediately washed with a cleaner, followed by 
soap and water. Should eye contact occur, it shall be flushed immediately with plenty of water 
for 15 minutes and a doctor called for.
If contact occurs with the clothing, it shall be immediately changed to prevent further skin 
contact, and if the contact occurs with components A or B, the clothing shall be thrown away. 
Hardened epoxy is not harmful but will break the clothing.
All emptied, used buckets, rags and containers shall be removed from site. These shall be 
stored in waste disposal bags and suitably disposed of.

the 
manufacturer 
and 
to 
satisfy 
requirements 
given 
in 
Clause 2804.2.1.
2805	
EPOXY  BONDING  OF  NEW  CONCRETE  TO  OLD  CONCRETE
2805.1	
Epoxy resin used for bonding shall be obtained from a reputed manufacturer. 
The pot life of such bonding epoxy shall not be less than 60 minutes at normal temperature.
2805.2	
The entire surface of the existing concrete member should be thoroughly 
cleaned by wire brush and then with compressed air to remove dust and loose particles 
from the surface. Any crack or spalling of concrete shall be sealed by epoxy injection/epoxy 
mortar/grouting as decided by the Engineer. A coating of suitable epoxy resin at the rate of 
0.8 kg/sq.m (minimum) should then be applied on the surface of the existing concrete 
members. Fresh concrete shall then be placed within the pot life of the resin system.
2805.3	
Testing
2805.3.1	
Epoxy used for bonding work shall satisfy the criteria mentioned in 
Clause 2803.9.
2805.3.2	
Two concrete cubes of 150 mm size cast as per approved design mix shall 
be placed at a distance of 150 mm from each other, as shown in Fig. 3 of Appendix-2800/1. 
Epoxy resin system suggested for bonding new to old concrete shall be applied on the 
opposite faces of the cubes.
Fresh cement concrete cube of grade as per approved design mix shall be cast with water 
cement ratio of 0.4 or less in the manner shown in Fig. 3 of Appendix 2800/1. The assembly 
shall be cured in water for 28 days and steel spacer removed thereafter.
The cube assembly shall be subjected to compression load after 28 days of curing, thereby 
subjecting the bond to shearing load. Failure must not occur at this joint.
2806 
CEMENT  GROUTING
2806.1 
Material
Grouting shall normally be performed with a mixture of neat Portland cement and water. Other 
additives and admixtures may be added to improve the impermeability and strength, with the 
approval of the Engineer. The size of the particles and the consistency of the grout must be 
suited to the passageways it must follow. Neat grout will not flow freely into holes smaller 



======================================================================
PAGE 789 of 903
======================================================================
Section 2800
Repair of Structures
770
than about three times the largest cement particle. Except in large cavities where thick mortar 
can be placed, the sand should all pass the 28-mesh sieve and have a large portion passing 
the 50-mesh and 100-mesh sieves. The proportions of Ordinary Portland cement to sand 
will depend upon the size of the spaces to be filled and will vary from a neat grout to about 
1:1 mix. The amount of water to be added depends upon the consistency required. Grouts 
with as little as 16 litres of water per bag of cement could be used and it should seldom be 
necessary to use more than 35 to 40 litres of water per bag of cement.
Where necessary and approved by the Engineer, additives and admixtures may be added 
to Portland cement grout mixtures for improving impermeability and strength, delaying the 
setting time, increasing flowability and minimizing segregation and shrinkage.
2806.2	
Preparation
The surface shall be cleaned with wire brush and compressed air. Thereafter holes of 15 mm 
dia and 150 mm to 200 mm deep may be drilled along the length of the cracks at a spacing 
of 500 mm by wet drilling using rotary percussion drills and nipples shall be inserted in these 
holes.
2806.3 
Proportioning, Mixing and Equipment for Grouting
The cement grout shall be mechanically mixed using a system of power-driven paddles 
of high speed centrifugal pump. The grout pump to be used shall permit close control of 
pressures to allow a flexible rate of injection with minimum clogging of valves and ports. 
The most satisfactory equipment for injecting grout is a pump of the double-acting flexible 
reciprocating type giving a steady flow. The grout pump shall be so placed as to reduce the 
waste in cleaning lines. It is preferable to put 50 percent or more of the mixing water into the 
mixer before adding the dry ingredients and then the remaining water. A continuous supply 
of grout is preferable to an intermittent one. Consistency of the grout may be determined by 
trials starting with thin grout i.e. about 40 litres of water per bag of cement and progressively 
decreasing the water content to about 15 litres per bag of cement.
Where the mixer and pump are combined in one unit, the dry material shall be screened 
before mixing. If the mixer and pump are in separate units, the grout shall pass through a 
screen before it enters the pump.
2806.4	
Application
Highest practical pressure within the limits of 100 kPa - 400 kPa should be used in order to 
force the surplus water from the grout. As the pressure may be distributed hydraulically over 
considerable areas, vigilance must be exercised to prevent damage or needless waste of 
grout. Adequate precaution shall be taken to ensure that leakage of grout does not occur.



======================================================================
PAGE 790 of 903
======================================================================
Repair of Structures
Section 2800
771
Pressure shall be steady to ensure a continuous flow of grout. Grouting shall not be continued 
till the hole consumes mix at the rate of not less than 30 litres in 20 minutes or until refusal 
at the grouting pressure of 400 kPa at any hole. Should the grout escape from an adjacent 
nipple, it should be plugged or capped. Any seam, crack or joint through which grout escapes 
shall be caulked with epoxy mortar as soon as thick grout appears.
2806.5	
Cleaning of Equipment
After completion of each grouting operation or temporary shutdown, it is advisable to force 
clear water through the pump until the discharge line shows no colour, after which the pump 
covers shall be removed and the valve chambers thoroughly cleaned.
2806.6	
Testing
Percolation test done at the end of grouting operation shall give a value of less than 2 lugions. 
For specialised treatment like polymer modified cementitious grout injection, manufacturer’s 
literature and specification shall be followed.
2807 
GUNITING/SHOTCRETING
2807.1	
The gunite shall comprise 100 parts by weight of cement, 300 parts by 
weight quartz sand, 35-50 parts by weight water and 2 parts by weight approved quick setting 
compound. In general, dry mix shotcrete shall be used.
2807.2	
Ordinary Portland cement conforming to IS:269 shall be used in guniting.
2807.3	
Sand for guniting shall comply with the requirements stipulated in IS: 383. In 
general, sand should neither be too coarse to increase the rebound nor too fine to increase 
the slump. Sand should preferably have moisture content between 3 to 6 percent.
The grading of sand shall lie within the limits given below:
	
IS Sieve	 	
	
	
Percent Passing the Sieve
	
Designation
	
4.75 mm	 	
	
	
95–100

300 micron	
	
	
10–22
	
150 micron	
	
	
2–8
2807.4	
For thick sections it may be advantageous to incorporate coarse aggregate 
in the mix provided adequate guniting equipment is available. Coarse aggregate, when used, 



======================================================================
PAGE 791 of 903
======================================================================
Section 2800
Repair of Structures
772
shall conform to grading given in Table-1 of IS:9012. The percentage of coarse aggregate 
may normally be kept as 20 to 40 percent of the total aggregate and the mix shall be suitably 
designed.
2807.5	
Water/cement ratio for guniting shall fall within the range of 0.35 to 0.50 by 
mass; wet enough to reduce the rebound. Drying shrinkage may be between 0.06 percent 
and 0.10 percent. The quick setting compound shall be added at the nozzle with water just 
before guniting.
2807.6	
Workmanship
The cement and sand shall be batched and mixed and conveyed through a hose pipe with 
the help of compressed air. A separate line shall bring the water under pressure. The cement, 
sand and water mix shall be passed through and intimately mixed in a special manifold and 
then projected at high velocity to the surface being repaired. The density of gunite shall not 
be less than 2000 kg/cu.m. The strength of gunite shall not be less than 25 MPa. For effective 
guniting, the nozzle shall be kept 600 mm to 1500 mm away from the surface, preferably 
normal to that surface. While enclosing reinforcement bars during repairs the nozzle shall be 
held closer at a slight angle and the mix shall be wetter than the normal.
2807.7	
Test panels simulating actual field conditions shall be fabricated for 
conducting preconstruction testing. The procedure for testing the cubes or cylinders taken 
from the panels stipulated in Clause 6 of IS:9012 shall be followed.
2807.8	
It should be ensured from tests that strength of about 25 MPa at 28 days is 
available for the mortar/concrete mix.
2807.9	
The defective concrete shall be cut out to the full depth till sound concrete 
surface is reached. Under no circumstances should the thickness of concrete to be removed 
be less than clear cover to the main reinforcement. No square shoulders shall be left at 
the perimeter of the cut-off portion and all edges shall be tapered. Thereafter, all loose and 
foreign materials should be removed and the surface sand blasted to make it rough to receive 
shotcrete after applying a coat of epoxy bonding as per recommendation of the manufacturer 
at the rate of 1.0 kg per 1.5 sq.m. of surface area.
2807.10	
The exposed reinforcement shall be thoroughly cleaned free of rust, scales 
etc. by wire brushing. Wherever the reinforcements have been corroded, the same shall be 
removed and replaced by additional reinforcement. Before application of gunite, a coat of 
neat cement slurry should be applied on the surface of the reinforcement.
2807.11	
Sufficient clearance shall be provided around the reinforcement to permit 
encasement with sound gunite. Care shall be taken to avoid sand pockets behind the 
reinforcement.

2807.12	
A thickness of 25 mm to 40 mm of gunite can normally be deposited in one 
operation. If, for some reason, the total thickness is to be built up in successive operations, 
the previous layer should be allowed to set but not become hard before the application of the 
subsequent layer. Guniting shall always be done on a damp concrete surface.
2807.13	
Where required, welded wire fabrics 50 mm x 50 mm x No. 10 gauge shall 
be provided in the first layer of guniting. The fabric shall be tied properly. In case the damage 
to the concrete member is very deep, the specifications for guniting as well as requirement 
of placement of wire mesh, has to be decided as per field conditions.
2807.14	
The stipulations given in IS:9012 regarding application of gunite should be 
followed so as to keep the rebound to the minimum. The quality of guniting and workmanship 
shall be such that the percentage of rebound mentioned in IS:9012 can be adhered to. In no 
circumstances shall the rebound material be re-used in the work.
2807.15	
It would be desirable that green gunite is moistened for at least 7 days. 
Guniting work shall not be done during windy or rainy conditions.

2903	
EXCAVATION  FOR  PIPE
The foundation bed for pipe culverts shall be excavated true to the lines and grades shown on 
the drawings or as directed by the Engineer.  The pipes shall be placed in shallow excavation 
of the natural ground or in open trenches cut in existing embankments, taken down to levels 
as shown on the drawings.  In case of high embankments where the height of fill is more 
than three times the external diameter of the pipe, the embankment shall first be built to an 
elevation above the top of the pipe equal to the external diameter of the pipe, and to width 
on each side of the pipe of not less than five times the diameter of pipe, after which a trench 
shall be excavated and the pipe shall be laid.
Where trenching is involved, its width on either side of the pipe shall be a minimum of 
150 mm or one-fourth of the diameter of the pipe whichever is more and shall not be more 
than one-third the diameter of the pipe.  The sides of the trench shall be as nearly vertical as 
possible.
The pipe shall be placed where the ground for the foundation is reasonably firm.  Installation 
of pipes under existing bridges or culverts shall be avoided as far as possible.  When during 
excavation the material encountered is soft, spongy or other unstable soil, and unless other 
special construction methods are called for on the drawings or in special provisions, such 
unsuitable material shall be removed to such depth, width and length as directed by the 
Engineer.  The excavation shall then be backfilled with approved granular material which 
shall be properly shaped and thoroughly compacted upto the specified level.
Where bed-rock or boulder strata are encountered, excavation shall be taken down to atleast 
200 mm below the bottom level of the pipe with prior permission of the Engineer and all rock/
boulders in this area be removed and the space filled with approved earth, free from stone 
or fragmented material, shaped to the requirements and thoroughly compacted to provide 
adequate support for the pipe.

2904	
BEDDING  FOR  PIPE
The bedding surface shall provide a firm foundation of uniform density throughout the length 
of the culvert, shall conform to the specified levels and grade, and shall be of one of the 
following two types as specified on the drawings :
	
i)	
First Class Bedding : Under first class bedding, the pipe shall be evenly 
bedded on a continuous layer of well compacted approved granular 
material, shaped concentrically to fit the lower part of the pipe exterior 
for atleast ten percent of its overall height or as otherwise shown on the 
drawings.  The bedding material shall be well graded sand or another 
granular material passing 5.6 mm sieve suitably compacted/rammed. 
The compacted thickness of the bedding layer shall be as shown on the 
drawings and in no case shall it be less than 75 mm.
	
ii)	
Concrete Cradle Bedding : When indicated on the drawings or directed 
by the Engineer, the pipe shall be bedded in a cradle constructed of 
concrete having a mix not leaner than M 15 conforming to Section 1700. 
The shape and dimensions of the cradle shall be as indicated on the 
drawings.  The pipes shall be laid on the concrete bedding before the 
concrete has set.
2905	
LAYING  OF  PIPE
No pipe shall be laid in position until the foundation has been approved by the Engineer. 
Where two or more pipes are to be laid adjacent to each other, they shall be separated by a 
distance equal to at least half the diameter of the pipe subject to a minimum of 450 mm.
The arrangement for lifting, loading and unloading concrete pipes from factory/yard and at 
site shall be such that the pipes do not suffer any undue structural strain, any damage due to 
fall or impact.  The arrangement may be got approved by the Engineer.
Similarly, the arrangement for lowering the pipe in the bed shall be got approved by the 
Engineer.  It may be with tripod-pulley arrangement or simply by manual labour in a manner 
that the pipe is placed in the proper position without damage.
The laying of pipes on the prepared foundation shall start from the outlet and proceed towards 
the inlet and be completed to the specified lines and grades.  In case of use of pipes with 
bell-mouth, the belled end shall face upstream.  The pipes shall be fitted and matched so that 
when laid in work, they form a culvert with a smooth uniform invert.

JOINTING
The pipes shall be jointed either by collar joint or by flush joint.  In the former case, the collars 
shall be of RCC 150 to 200 mm wide and having the same strength as the pipes to be jointed. 
Caulking space shall be between 13 and 20 mm according to the diameter of the pipe. 
Caulking material shall be slightly wet mix of cement and sand in the ratio of 1:2 rammed with 
caulking irons.  Before caulking, the collar shall be so placed that its center coincides with the 
joint and an even annular space is left between the collar and the pipe.
Flush joint may be internal flush joint or external flush joint.  In either case, the ends of the 
pipes shall be specially shaped to form a self centering joint with a jointing space 13 mm wide. 
The jointing space shall be filled with cement mortar, 1 cement to 2 sand, mixed sufficiently 
dry to remain in position when forced with a trowel or rammer.  Care shall be taken to fill all 
voids and excess mortar shall be removed.
For jointing pipe lines under light hydraulic pressure, the recess at the end of the pipe shall 
be filled with jute braiding dipped in hot bitumen or other suitable approved compound.  Pipes 
shall be so jointed that the bitumen ring of one pipe shall set into the recess of the next pipe. 
The ring shall be thoroughly compressed by jacking or by any other suitable method.
All joints shall be made with care so that their interior surface is smooth and consistent with 
the interior surface of the pipes.  After finishing, the joint shall be kept covered and damp for 
at least four days.
2907	
BACKFILLING
Trenches shall be backfilled immediately after the pipes have been laid and the jointing 
material has hardened.  The backfill soil shall be clean, free from boulders, large roots, 
excessive amounts of sods or other vegetable matter, and lumps and shall be approved by 
the Engineer.  Backfilling upto 300 mm above the top of the pipe shall be carefully done and 
the soil thoroughly rammed, tamped or vibrated in layers not exceeding 150 mm, particular 
care being taken to thoroughly consolidate the materials under the haunches of the pipe. 
Approved pneumatic or light mechanical tamping equipment can be used.
Filling of the trench shall be carried out simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in such a 
manner that unequal pressures do not occur.
In case of high embankment, after filling the trench upto the top of the pipe in the above said 
manner, a loose fill of a depth equal to external diameter of the pipe shall be placed over the 
pipe before further layers are added and compacted.

Section 3100
815
reinforcing elements, the following shall be adhered to as provided in the guidelines of FHWA 
NHI-10-025.
	
i)	
To provide a coherent reinforced soil mass, the vertical spacing of primary 
reinforcement shall not exceed 800 mm, in all types of reinforcement.
	
ii)	
For walls constructed with modular blocks and deriving their connection 
capacity by friction, and also for any other facia configurations, where 
connection capacity is by friction, the maximum vertical spacing 
of reinforcement shall be two times the block width (measured from 
front fact to back face of the block). Further, the maximum spacing of 
reinforcing elements shall not exceed 800 mm in all cases.
	
	
The maximum height of facing left unreinforced a) above the uppermost 
reinforcing layer and b) below the lowest reinforcing layer, shall not exceed the 
width of the block (measured from the front face to back face of the block.)
	
iii)	
In case modular blocks are used for facia, no more than one intervening block 
shall be left without having primary reinforcement.
	
iv)	
In case of wraparound facings for walls, the maximum spacing of reinforcing 
elements shall not exceed 500 mm, to protect against bulging.
	
v)	
Where panels are used, the maximum spacing of reinforcement shall not 
exceed 800 mm. The spacing of nearest reinforcing element shall be such 
that maximum height of facing above uppermost reinforcement layer and 
below the lower most reinforcement layer does not exceed 400 mm.
	
vi)	
Reinforcement spacings worked out from the design procedures shall be 
configured to fit the above parameters.
A2-1.2	
Where as the role of the primary reinforcement is to carry the tensile forces 
in the reinforced fill, secondary reinforcement may be required to protect the slope face 
from local sloughing and instability depending upon the facia configuration adopted. Where 
secondary reinforcement is used, stability of the area near the slope face shall be checked 
separately.
Where metallic type facia elements are used, the lower part of the facia element may be 
extended into the fill to serve as a secondary reinforcement. In other types of facia, geogrids 
may also be used as a secondary reinforcement. The length of the secondary reinforcement 
shall be adequate to provide local stability in the vicinity of the slope face.
A3	
REINFORCED  SOIL  SLOPES
A3-1.1	
Reinforced Soil Slopes
Reinforced soil slopes are used in a wide variety of situations, such as
	
a)	
Construction of new embankments
	
b)	
Widening of existing slopes.
	
c)	
To construct a reinforced slope above a reinforced soil wall.



======================================================================
PAGE 835 of 903
======================================================================
Section 3100
Reinforced Soil
816
Reinforced slopes with face angle between 70° and 45° are classified as steep slopes and 
those with face angle flatter than or equal to 45° are classified as shallow slopes.
Design: The design and spacing of reinforcement shall be established based on the design 
principles of Clause A1 and per the provisions in standards BS:8006-1-2010, FHWA-NHI-10-
024 and FHWA-NHI-10-025. The design is mainly based on rotational stability analysis.
Steep slopes require a suitable facing to hold the reinforcement in-place as well as to protect 
the slope from local instability adjacent to the face. In the case of flatter slopes also, facing 
may be called for. Depending upon the properties of the fill and local climatic conditions of 
the area, suitable slope protection measures need to be adopted.
Where wrap around facia, gabion facia, woven and welded wire mesh facia are used suitable 
batter needs to be given. This batter may also be achieved by means of providing stepped 
offsets in placing the facia elements.
A3-1.2	
Facia
Facing shall enable the construction within specified tolerances of vertical and horizontal 
alignment and it should perform over the design life. The facing system should be able 
to meet the functional requirements such as rigidity, flexibility, aesthetics, environmental 
considerations etc. depending on location, purpose and use of structure.
For reinforced soil slopes of permanent nature, the durability of basic material for facing shall 
be ensured. A suitable filter should be provided behind the woven or welded steel wire mesh 
elements when they are provided in wrap around form. For steeper slopes in high rainfall 
intensity and/or high seismicity areas, combination of woven and welded steel wire mesh 
elements with additional stiffening elements and filter cloth shall be used to achieve flexibility, 
erosion prevention and stiffness requirements.
Where geosynthetics are used as facing for permanent reinforced slope structures, outer 
facia elements are required to be protected against UV degradation from sunlight. When 
vegetation is used as the facia cover, the face should provide a suitable medium like coir or 
jute for the establishment and continued growth of vegetation. For a vegetated face, several 
interrelated aspects need to be considered, including the climate, water requirements of plants 
and water availability, site location aspect, altitude, amount and frequency of precipitation, 
exposure, form of facing and erosion resistance capability to ensure permanent vegetative 
covering throughout the design life . If the characteristics of back fill soil are not adequate to 
support vegetation, suitable top soil material may be placed at the front face separated from 
the fill by an appropriate separator.
The contractor shall provide facing for the reinforced soil slope as approved by the designer 
and shown in the drawing plan.

Section 3200
821
3201	
SCOPE
The specifications shall apply to soil nailing works as required to be carried out under the 
Contract or as directed by the Engineer.
3202 
NAIL  INSTALLATION  METHODS
3202.1	
Generally used soil nail installation techniques in practice are: (i) drilled and 
grouted soil nails, and (ii) driven soil nails. Grouted nails are recommended for all types of 
soil nail walls applications; and in particular, for walls with vertical height more than 7 m. 
Driven nails shall only be used when wall heights are smaller (less than or upto 7.0 m). The 
major difference between the two is the pullout resistance of the soil nails and grouted soil 
nails are expected to have higher pull out resistance. Pull out test is desirable to check the 
values of pullout resistance which is useful in soil nail design.
3202.2	
Drilled and grouted soil nails (or simply grouted nails), are approximately 
75 mm to 200 mm diameter nail holes drilled in the soil mass to be retained, which shall be 
followed by placing of steel reinforcement bars (tendon) and the grouting of the drill hole.
3202.3	
Driven soil nails are relatively small in diameter (20 mm to 25 mm) and are 
mechanically driven into the ground. They are usually spaced approximately 0.5 m to 1.0 m 
apart.
3203 
CONSTRUCTION  MATERIALS
Following covers the general materials required for the construction of typical soil nailing 
structure.
3203.1	
Reinforcement Bar (Nail or Tendon)
The reinforcing element (tendon) shall be high strength steel reinforcing bar conforming to 
IS:1786 with a characteristic tensile strength of 415 MPa or higher which may be threaded at 
one end. Minimum recommended diameter of reinforcement bar (tendon) is 16 mm.
3203.2	
Nail head
The nail head shall comprise of following main components: the bearing-plate, hex nut, and 
washers; and the headed-stud. The bearing plate with a central hole (with diameter greater 
than reinforcement bar) shall be of minimum Fe250 grade steel, typically square in shape 
with 200 to 250 mm side dimension and 19 mm thickness. Washers and nuts shall be made 
of steel with a grade consistent with that of the nail bar commonly of 415 MPa or higher. 
Nuts may be tightened with a hand-wrench. The headed-stud connection may consist of four 
headed studs welded near the four corners of the bearing plate to provide anchorage of the

======================================================================
Section 3200
Soil Nailing
822
nail head into the permanent facing. For temporary walls, the bearing plate shall be on the 
outside face of the shotcrete facing.
3203.3	
Grout
Grout for soil nails is required to fill the annular space between the nail bar and the surrounding 
ground, and for shotcreting of the temporary facing. Grout for soil nail walls is commonly a 
neat cement grout with the water/cement ratio typically ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. Grout mix shall 
be prepared in accordance with IS:9012. Grout shall have a minimum 28 days characteristic 
strength of 20 MPa. For filling up nail holes, grout shall be pumped shortly after the nail bar 
is placed in the drillhole to reduce the potential for hole squeezing or caving. In solid nail bar 
applications, the grout may be injected by tremie methods through a grout pipe, which is 
previously inserted to the bottom of the drillhole, until the grout completely fills the drillhole.
3203.4	
Centralizers
Centralizers are devices made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other synthetic materials that 
are installed at various locations along the length of each nail bar to ensure that a minimum 
thickness of grout completely covers the nail bar. Centralizers shall be installed at regular 
intervals, typically not exceeding 2.5 m, along the length of the nail and at a distance of about 
0.5 m from each end of the nail.
3204	
FACING  TYPES
Soil nail walls are generally provided with two types of facings: (a) temporary facing and
(b) permanent facing.
3204.1	
Temporary Facing
Temporary facing shall be constructed by providing reinforcement in the form of welded wire 
mesh (conforming to IS:1566) throughout the wall face, and by additional bearing plates (see 
Clause 3203.2.) and waler bars (rebars of smaller lengths placed in the vicinity of nail head) 
at the nail heads; which is, subsequently shotcreted in accordance with IS:9012. Overall 
temporary facing thickness shall vary from 75 mm to 200 mm.
3204.2	
Permanent  Facing
Permanent facing may be constructed as cast-in-place reinforced cement concrete 
conforming to IS:456, precast concrete or any suitable material to achieve desired strength 
and aesthetics. Reinforcement in the permanent facing may be adopted in the form of welded 
wire mesh or reinforcement bars in either direction. Permanent facing shall be connected 
to the temporary facing by means of headed-studs (usually four numbers per plate) welded 
on the bearing plates installed during construction temporary facing. Minimum thickness of 
permanent facing shall not be less than 200 mm.

3205	
CONSTRUCTION  SEQUENCE
3205.1	
Typical sequence of construction of a soil nail wall shall be in accordance 
with following steps:
Step 1:	
Excavation of initial cut of 1.0 m to 2.0 m depending upon the capacity of in-
situ soil to stand unsupported for about 12-24 hrs;
Step 2:	
Drilling hole for nail;
Step 3:	
Installation of nails followed by grouting and placing of drainage strip;
Step 4:	
Placing of construction facing and installation of bearing plates;
Step 5:	
Repetition of process till final level is reached; and
Step 6:	
Placing of final facing.
3206	
GEOTECHNICAL  ASPECTS
3206.1	
Soil Investigation
For soil nail walls more than 30 m long, exploratory borings should be spaced between 30 to 
60 m along the proposed centerline of the wall. For walls less than 30 m long, at least one 
boring is necessary along the proposed centerline of the wall. Borings are also necessary 
in front and behind the proposed wall. Borings behind the wall should be located within a 
distance up to 1 to 1.5 times the height of the wall behind the wall and should be spaced up to 
45 m along the wall alignment. Borings in front of the wall should be located within a distance 
up to 0.75 times the wall height in front of the wall and should be spaced up to 60 m along 
the wall alignment. The depth of borings should extend at least one full wall height below the 
bottom of the excavation.
3206.2	
Bond Strength
The bond strength is the mobilized shear resistance along the soil-grout interface. The 
bond strength adopted for the design of soil nails is commonly based on conservative 
estimates obtained from field correlation studies and local experience in similar conditions. 
Consequently, some percentage of the soil nails shall be load tested according to standard 
procedure (pullout tests) in the field to verify bond strength design.
3206.3	
Suitable In-Situ Ground Conditions
Following are the in-situ conditions considered favorable for the prospective use of soil nailing 
technique.
	
a)	
Soil shall be able to stand unsupported to a depth of about 1 m – 
2 m high vertical or nearly vertical cut for 12-24 hours.



======================================================================
PAGE 843 of 903
======================================================================
Section 3200
Soil Nailing
824
	
b)	
Groundwater table shall be sufficiently below level of the lowermost 
soil nail at all cross-sections.
	
c)	
Favorable soils: Stiff to hard fine –grained soils, dense to very dense 
granular soils with some apparent cohesion, weathered rock with no 
weakness planes and glacial soils.
3207 
ANALYSIS  OF  FAILURE  MODES
3207.1	
Analysis of various failure modes of soil nail structures shall be performed 
using allowable stress design methodology in accordance with IRC publication “Interim 
Guidelines for Soil Nailing Technique in Highway Engineering Applications” or any 
other state-of-art standard for analysis, design and construction of soil nail walls. For rigorous 
analyses, use of computational tools based on advanced numerical techniques such as finite 
element method, is strongly recommended.
3208	
INITIAL  DESIGN  CONSIDERATIONS
3208.1	
Wall layout
Establish the layout of the soil nail wall, including: (1) wall height; (2) length of the wall;
(3) backslope; and (4) wall face batter. Wall face batter typically ranges from 0º to 10º. The 
evaluation of the wall layout also includes developing longitudinal profile of the wall, locating 
wall appurtenances (e.g., traffic barriers, utilities, and drainage systems), and establishing 
ROW limitations.
3208.2	
Soil Nail Vertical and Horizontal Spacing
Typically, same nail spacing can be adopted in both horizontal Sh and vertical S­v directions. 
Nail spacing ranges from 1.25 to 2 m (commonly 1.5 m) for conventional drilled and grouted 
soil nails, and as low as 0.4 m for driven nails. As a general rule, soil nail spacing in horizontal 
and vertical direction must be such that each nail has an influence area Sh × Sv ≤ 4m2.
3208.3	
Soil Nail Pattern on Wall Face
The soil nail pattern on wall face may be adopted as one of the following: (1) square (or 
rectangular); (2) staggered in a triangular pattern; and (3) irregular (at limited locations) 
depending upon the ease of construction and site-specific constraints.
3208.4	
Soil Nail Inclination
 Soil nails are typically installed at an inclination ranging from 0 to 30 degrees from horizontal 
with a typical inclination of 10-25 degrees.

PAGE 844 of 903
======================================================================
Soil Nailing
Section 3200
825
3208.5	
Soil Nail Length and Distribution
The distribution of soil nail lengths in a soil nail wall can be selected as either uniform (i.e., 
only one nail length is used for the entire wall), or variable, where different nail lengths 
may be used for individual soil nail levels within a wall cross section. Uniform nail pattern is 
recommended for most applications.
3209	
OTHER  DESIGN  CONSIDERATIONS
3209.1	
Loads and Load Combinations
Soil nail walls used on typical highway projects are typically subjected to the following different 
loads during their service life: (i) Dead loads DL (e.g., weight of the soil nail wall system, 
lateral earth pressure, weight of a nearby above-ground structure); (ii) Live loads LL (e.g., 
traffic loads); (iii) impact loads IL (e.g., vehicle collision on barriers above soil nail wall); and 
(iv) earthquake loads EQ. Following load combinations are recommended to assess the 
most critical loading condition:
	
(a)	
DL + LL
	
(b)	
DL + LL + IL
	
(c)	
DL + EQ
For earthquake loads, allowable stresses shall be increased by 133 percent from the values 
obtained with factors of safety for static loads.
3209.2	
Permissible Soil Nail Wall Deformations
The maximum permissible lateral deformation at the top of the soil nail walls constructed 
in weathered rock and stiff soils is 0.1%H; sandy soils is 0.2%H and for fine-grained soils 
is 0.3%H. Under no circumstances maximum permissible lateral deformation shall exceed 
0.3%H, where: H is the vertical height of the soil nail wall. Permissible vertical deformation 
(i.e., settlement) shall be considered to be same as the permissible horizontal deformation. 
3209.3 
Drainage Measures
3209.3.1	
Short Term Drainage Measures
Surface water and groundwater must be controlled both during and after construction of the 
soil nail wall. A surface water interceptor ditch, excavated along the crest of the excavation 
and lined with concrete, is a recommended element for controlling surface water flows. 
Additionally, if ground water impacts are temporary or localized, suitable dewatering measures 
may be taken for lowering the groundwater table:



======================================================================
PAGE 845 of 903
======================================================================
Section 3200
Soil Nailing
826
3209.3.2	
Long Term Drainage Measures
Long term drainage shall be provided by means of the drainage system comprising of:
(i) vertical geo-composite drain strips placed suitably along the face of wall; (ii) weep holes 
in the form of perforated PVC pipes of typical diameter as 50-100 mm and 300- 600 mm 
length, placed through the face at the location of expected localised seepage; (iii) provision of 
horizontal or slightly inclined drain pipes of typical diameter 50 mm installed at the locations 
where it is necessary to control the groundwater pressures imposed on the retained soil 
mass; (iv) installation of permanent interception ditch behind the wall at its crest to prevent 
surface water runoff from infiltrating behind the wall or flowing over the wall edge; and
(v) provision of a vegetative protective cap/cover to reduce or prevent water infiltration into 
the soil.
3209.4	
Corrosion Protection
Corrosion potential of the soil must be evaluated for all permanent soil nail walls and, in some 
cases, for temporary walls.
Corrosion protection measures: (a) Specify a minimum grout cover of 25 mm between 
the reinforcement nail bar and the soil; (b) recommend epoxy coating of minimum thickness 
0.4 mm on the nail bars shall be applied by the manufacturer prior to shipment of nails to the 
construction site, which is, subsequently to be encased in grout cover; and (c) adopt other 
site-specific suitable corrosion protection measures.
3210	
FIELD  PULLOUT  TESTING
3210.1	
Field pullout testing of soil nails shall be conducted (a) to verify that the nail 
design loads can be carried without excessive movements and with an adequate safety 
factor for the service life of the structure, and (b) to verify the adequacy of the contractor’s 
drilling, installation, and grouting operations prior to and during construction of production soil 
nails.
3210.2	
Types of Field Pullout Tests
Depending upon the type of test being performed, the maximum test load, the load increments, 
and the time that each load increment is held shall be determined. To prevent chances 
of explosive failure of the steel, in no case, the soil nail tendon be stressed to more than 
80 percent of its minimum ultimate tensile strength for grade Fe415 steel, or more than 
90 percent of the minimum yield strength for grade Fe500 steel.

======================================================================
Soil Nailing
Section 3200
827
3210.2.1	
Verification Test
A verification test on soil nail is performed: (a) to determine the ultimate bond capacity (if 
carried to pullout failure); (b) verify the design bond factor of safety, and (c) to determine the 
soil nail load at which excessive creep occurs. Verification tests are generally conducted on 
non-production “sacrificial” nails as a first order of work prior to construction.
3210.2.2	
Proof Test
A proof test is typically performed on a specified number of the total number of production 
soil nails installed. Typically, successful proof tests shall be performed on 5 percent of the 
production nails in each row or a minimum of 1 test per row. Proof tests provide information 
necessary to evaluate the ability of production soil nails to safely withstand design loads 
without excessive structural movement or long-term creep over the structure’s service life.
3210.2.3	
Creep Test
Creep tests are generally performed as part of a verification or proof test to ensure that nail 
design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure service life.
3211 
MEASUREMENT  FOR  PAYMENT
Measurements for earthwork shall conform to IS:1200(Part I), concrete work shall conform 
to IS:1200(Part II) and steelworks shall conform to IS:1200(Part VIII). Measurement of facia 
shall be in sq. metres.
3212	
RATES
Rates for labour, machinery and various structural components shall conform to the local 
schedule of rates in practice.

Method of Sieving for Wet Soils to 
Determine the Degree of PulVerisation
 
1. 
A sample of pulverised soil approximately 1kg in weight should be taken 
and weighed (W1).
 
2. 
It should be spread on the sieve and shaken gently, care being taken to 
break the lumps of soils as little as possible. Weight of soil retained on 
the sieve should be recorded (W2). Lumps of finer soils in the retained 
material should be broken until all the individual particulars finer than 
the aperture size of the sieve are separated.
 
3. 
The soil should again be placed on the sieve and shaken until sieving 
is complete. The retained material should be weighed (W3).
 
4. 
Weight of soil by percent passing the sieve can than be calculated from

(Refer Clause 509.2.4)
Anti-Stripping Agents Used for Bituminous
Materials and Mixes
1	
Scope
1.1 
Anti-stripping agents are used for bituminous materials and mixes to ensure 
adhesion between aggregates (hydrophilic in nature) and bitumen, even under submergence 
in water. Prior approval of the Engineer shall be taken in respect of both qualitative and 
quantitative use of a particular product.
2	
Materials
2.1 
The anti-stripping agents shall be fatty acid amines having a long hydrocarbon 
chain.
2.2	
Physical and Chemical Requirements: The anti-stripping agents shall 
conform to the physical and chemical requirements as detailed in Table A4-1.
2.3	
Storage and Handling: Anti-stripping agents shall be properly stored in 
closed containers made of steel or aluminium. Containers made of zinc, copper, polythene 
PVC and most types of rubber are not suitable for use. As most of the anti-stripping agents 
cause irritation when in contact with human skin and are also irritating to the eyes, protective 
gloves for hands and goggles for the eyes shall be used while handling them, specially in 
case of liquid anti-stripping agents.
3	
Use in Sprayed Work
3.1	
Additive Dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature 
(stripping value) of the aggregate and the size of aggregate. While the recommended minimum 
dose of anti-stripping agent for sprayed work is given in Table A4-2, the actual dosage shall 
be determined in the laboratory as directed by the Engineer.
3.2	
Mixing Procedure During Construction: The anti-stripping agent supplied 
in liquid, solid or concentrate form shall be thoroughly mixed with liquid bituminous material 
or with straight run bitumen. When used with straight run bitumen, the correct dose of 
antistripping agent shall be mixed in a hot bitumen tank boiler.
The two constituents shall be agitated till the ani-stripping agent is thoroughly mixed. The 
dose of anti-stripping agent shall suitable be increased if the binder is to remain in bitumen 
boiler for a longer period.
4	
Use in Premix Work
4.1	
Additive Dosage: The dosage shall be determined depending on the nature 
(stripping value) of the aggregate and the percent voids in the mix. While the recommended 
minimum doses for different types of bituminous premix materials in terms of voids content 
are given in Table A4-3, the actual dosage shall be determined in the laboratory as directed 
by the Engineer.

Mixing Procedure During Construction : The required dose of the anti-
stripping agent shall be poured into hot bitumen tank and allowed 15 to 30 minutes of circulation 
or stirred to ensure a homogeneous mix. It is necessary to use a stable antistripping agent 
or increase the dose according to expected degradation. Alternatively, the correct dose shall 
be injected into the bitumen line by means of a pump. The agent is fed into the bitumen first 
before it is sprayed on the aggregate in the mix; thus, no separate mixing time for mixing 
the agent with bitumen is required. In rolled asphalt and bitumen mastic surfacing works, 
precoated chippings are pressed into the hard surface while the mix is still hot to make the 
newly laid surface skid resistant. These chippings shall be precoated with bitumen treated 
with antistripping compound.

Testing Procedure for Solubility of 
Antistripping Agent in Diesel Oil
Procedure: 98 ml of diesel oil (HDO or LDO) and 2 ml of antistripping agent shall be taken in 
a measuring cylinder with stopper. The cylinder along with its contents shall be dept in water 
bath, maintained at 50º + 1ºC for half an hour. It shall then be taken out from water bath and 
shaken vigorously for 10 minutes. The stopper shall be removed and the cylinder kept in 
water bath for half an hour and examined for separation or settlement.
Reporting of Results: An antistripping agent is reported to be completely soluble in diesel 
oil if no separation or settlement is observed for half an hour.
Testing Stripping Value of Aggregates Using Bitumen with 
Varying Percentages of Antistripping Agent
Procedure: Coarse aggregate passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm sieve shall 
be washed and dried in an oven for 24 hours at 110ºC. Such dried 200 gms of coarse 
aggregates shall be heated at 149ºC and then mixed with 80/100 penetration grade bitumen 
5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate heated upto 163ºC. The mixture shall be mixed 
thoroughly for uniform coating of aggregates by bitumen. The mix shall then be transferred to 
a 500 ml beaker and allowed to cool to room temperature. Distilled water shall be added in 
the beaker, which shall be placed in a water bath maintained at 40º ± 1ºC for 24 hours. The 
percentage degree of stripping shall be assessed visually. The test shall also be conducted 
with water containing 1 percent Sodium Chloride, as a precautionary measure to eliminate 
water contamination. The test is repeated using bitumen containing upto one percent of 
antistripping agent in stages of 0.25 percent.
Testing Efficacy of Antistripping Agent to Coat Aggregates 
with Bitumen in Presence of Water
Procedure: The antistripping agent shall be added in percent contents of 0.0, 0.25, 0.50., 0.75, 
1.00 and 1.25 to cutback bitumen MC3 (4 parts of bitumen 80/100 and 1 part of kerosene oil). 
The blends shall be used for testing their ability to coat the road aggregates under water.

The bottle shall be filled to 3/4 of its volume with distilled water at 40ºC. The bitumen-
antistripping agent blend shall be added in the bottle at the rate of 7.5 percent by weight of 
stone dust. The stopper shall be replaced and the bottle shall be vigorously shaken for two 
minutes. The water shall be then drained off and the stone dust shall be transferred to a 
piece of paper and examined visually for satisfying complete coating. The minimum percent 
content of antistripping agent at which the stone dust sample is thoroughly coated shall be 
rocorded. The test shall be repeated at 60ºC in water as well as 1 percent solution of Sodium 
Chloride in water for both the testing temperatures.
 
(b) 
The under water coating test further be conducted with coarse 
aggregate, passing 19 mm sieve and retained on 13.2 mm siee. In this 
case, the percent content of the cutback-antistripping agent blend shall 
be kept at 5 percent by weight of coarse aggregate. In order to take 
care of contamination in water, the test shall also be carried out in the 
1 percent Sodium Chloride in water.
The minimum percent content of antistripping agent at which stone dust/coarse aggregate is 
thoroughly coated as per (a) and (b) shall be taken as the dose of antistripping agent.
Testing for Thermal Stability of Antistripping Agent
Procedure: Blends of antistripping agent and bitumen of 80/100 grade shall be prepared 
with 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 percent contents of antistripping agent and kept in oven 
at 163ºC for five hours. After the heat exposure, the blend samples are fluxed with kerosene 
oil to obtain the consistency of MC 3 and tested for under water coating test.
Reporting of Test Results: An antistripping agent shall be deemed to be heat resistant if the 
dose requirement before and after heat exposure remains unchanged.
Quantitative Evaluation of Retained Marshall Stability 
Values After Immersion in Water
Procedure: For Quantitative evaluation, the tests shall be carried out as stipulated in 
ASTM D1075 (Effect of Water on Cohesion of Compacted Bituminous Mixtures). The gradation 
of aggregates shall be such as to give sufficient voids in the compacted bituminous mix to 
bring out the effects of stripping. The gradation of aggregates shall be as under:

The Marshall test specimens shall be prepared using 5 percent bitumen of 80/100 grade 
by weight of aggregates blended with varying percentages of antistripping agents from 0 
to 1 percent in steps of 0.25 percent. The test samples shall give a void content of about 6 
percent. At least 8 standard Marshall specimens for each of the varying antistripping agent 
percentages shall be prepared. Each set of 8 test specimens shall be sorted out in two groups 
of 4 each so that the average specific gravity of the specimen in Group I shall be essentially 
the same as in Group II. Group-I shall be tested for Marshall Stability in the usual procedure 
ASTM D1559. Group-II specimens shall be immersed in water for 24 hours at 60ºC ± 1ºC and 
then shall be tested immediately for Marshall stability as per ASTM D 1559.
Calculation: The numerical index of resistance of bituminous mixtures to the detrimental 
effect of water shall be expressed as the index of retained stability:
	
	
Average Marshall Stability of Group-II

SPECIFICATION FOR CONSTRUCTION JOINTS
Location
The location of construction joint shall be as shown on the drawing or as approved by the 
Engineer. If additional/new joints are approved by the Engineer, the following considerations 
for their location shall be taken into account:
 
(i) 
Joints shall be provided in non-aggressive zones or in non-splash 
zones. If not feasible, the joints shall be sealed.
 
(ii) 
Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for 
preparation and concreting , such as location where the cross-section 
is relatively small, and where reinforcement is not congested.
 
(iii) In beams and slabs, joints should not be near the supports. Construction 
Joints between slabs and ribs in composite beams should be avoided.
 
(iv) For box girders, it is preferable to cast the soffit and the webs without 
any joint.
 
(v) 
Location of joints shall minimize the effects of the discontinuity on the 
durability, structural integrity and the appearance of the structure.
Preparation of Surface of the Joint
Laitance shall be removed before fresh concrete is cast. The surface shall be roughened. 
Care shall be taken that they should not dislodge the coarse aggregates. Concrete may be 
brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting while the concrete is still fresh.
If the concrete has partially hardened, it shall be treated by wire brushing or with a stiff water 
jet followed by drying with air jet immediately.
Fully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking 
care not to split or crack aggregate particles.
Before further concrete is cast, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to remove debris 
and accumulated rubbish, one effective method being by air jet.
Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement 
shall be protected. Before the next lift is placed, rust, loose mortar or other contamination shall 
be removed from the reinforcements. In aggressive environment, the concrete shall be cut 
back to expose the reinforcements for a length of about 50 mm to ensure that contaminated 
concrete is removed.



======================================================================
PAGE 881 of 903
======================================================================
Appendices
Appendices
862
The joint surface shall not be contaminated with release agents, dust or curing membrane.
Concreting of Joints
The old surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and soaked with water. Standing water shall be 
removed shortly before the new concrete is placed and the new concrete shall be thoroughly 
compacted. Concreting shall be carried out continuously upto the construction joints.
Surface retarders may be used to improve the quality of construction joints.
For a vertical construction joint, a stopping board shall be fixed previously at the predetermined 
position and shall be properly stayed to prevent its displacement or bulging when concrete is 
compacted against it. Concreting shall be continued right upto the board.

TESTS ON SHEATHING DUCTS
All tests specified below shall be carried out on the same sample in the order given below.
At least 3 samples for one lot of supply (not exceeding 7000 metre length) shall be tested.
The tests are applicable for sheathing transported to site in straight lengths when the 
prestressing cable is threaded inside the sheathing prior to concreting. These tests are not 
applicable for sheathing not for coiled cable and transported to site as an assembled unit, 
nor for sheathing ducts placed in position without threading of prestressing cable prior to 
concreting.
(A)	
WORKABILITY TEST
A test sample 1100 mm long is soldered to a fixed base plate with a soft solder 
(Fig.1800/I-1). The  sample   is  then  bent to a radius  of  1800  mm alternately on either side to 
complete 3 cycles.
Thereafter, the sealing joints will be visually inspected to verify that no failure/opening has 
taken place.
(B)	
TRANSVERSE LOAD RATING TEST
The test ensures that stiffness of the sheathing is sufficient to prevent permanent distortion 
during site handling.
The sample is placed on a horizontal support 500 mm long so that the sample is supported 
at all points of outward corrugations.
A load as specified in Table 1 is applied gradually at the centre of the supported portion through 
a contact surface 12 mm long. It shall be ensured that the load is applied approximately at the 
centre of two corrugations, Fig. 1800/I-2. The load as specified is applied in increments.

SPECIFICATIONS FOR GROUTING OF POST-TENSIONED 
CABLES IN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE BRIDGES
1	
GENERAL
1.1 
The recommendations cover the cement grouting of post- tensioned tendons 
of prestressed concrete members of bridges. This also covers some of the essential protective 
measures to be adopted for minimising corrosion in PSC bridges.
1.2 
The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post-
tensioned steel against corrosion and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and 
the surrounding structural concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline 
environment for corrosion protection and by filling the duct space, it prevents water collection 
and freezing.
2	
MATERIALS
2.1	
Water
Only clean potable water free from impurities conforming to Section 1000 shall be permitted. 
No sea or creek water is to be used at all.
2.2	
Cement
Ordinary Portland cement should be used for preparation of the grout. It should be as fresh 
as possible and free of any lumps. Pozzolana cement shall not be used.
2.3	
Sand
It is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing tendons. In case the internal 
diameter of the ducts exceeds 150 mm, use of sand may be considered. Sand used, shall 
conform to IS:383 and shall pass through IS Sieve No. 150. The weight of sand in the grout 
shall not be more than 10 percent of the weight of cement, unless proper workability can be 
ensured by addition of suitable plasticizers.
2.4	
Admixtures
Acceptable admixtures conforming to IS:9102 may be used if tests have shown that their use 
improves the properties of grout, i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or 
expanding the grout. Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates, sulphides, sulphites or 



======================================================================
PAGE 893 of 903
======================================================================
Appendices
Appendices
874
any other products which are likely to damage the steel or grout. When an expanding agent 
is used, the total unrestrained expansion should not exceed 10 percent. Aluminum powder 
as an expanding agent is not recommended for grouting because its long term effects are 
not free from doubt.
2.5	
Sheathing
2.5.1 
For specifications of sheathing, Section 1800 may be referred
2.5.2 
Grout openings or vents
 
a) 
All ducts should have grout openings at both ends. For this purpose 
special openings should be provided where such openings are not 
available at end anchorages. For draped (curved) cables vents shall 
be provided at all crown and valley points. It is a good practice to 
provide additional air vents at suitable intervals not exceeding 20 m. 
All grout openings or vents should include provisions for preventing 
grout leakage.
 
b) 
Standard details of fixing Couplers, inlets, outlets and air vents to the 
duct anchorage shall be followed as recommended by the supplier of 
the prestressing system.
2.5.3 
Ducts should be securely fastened at close intervals. All un-intended holes or 
openings in the duct must be repaired prior to concrete placing, The joints of the couplers and 
the sheathing should be made water proof by use of adhesive tape or similar suitable system 
capable of giving leak proof joints, Grout openings and vents must be securely anchored to 
the duct and to either forms or to reinforcing steel to prevent displacement during concreting 
operations due to weight, buoyancy and vibrations.
2.5.4 
Ducts require very careful handling as, being of thin metal, they are susceptible 
to leakage due to corrosion in transit or storage, by tearing/ripping in handling particularly 
when placed adjoining to reinforcing steel, by pulling apart at joints while inserting tendons 
prior to concreting, or by accidental puncturing while drilling for form ties/inserts. Ducts are 
also liable to damage by rough use of internal vibrator and sparks from welding being done 
close by.
3	
EQUIPMENT
3.1	
Grout Mixer and Agitator
It is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogeneous State and of uniform consistency 
so that there is no separation of cement. Use of grout mixers to obtain a colloidal grout is 
essential. The mixer should have an additional storage device with an agitator to keep the 



======================================================================
PAGE 894 of 903
======================================================================
Appendices
Appendices
875
grout moving continuously before it is pumped in the duct. Positive reciprocating type grout 
pumps should be used.
3.2	
Grout Pump
The pump should be a positive displacement type and should be capable of ejecting the 
grout in a continuous operation and not by way of pulses. The grout pump must be fitted with 
a pressure gauge to enable pressure of injection to be controlled. The minimum pressure 
at which grout should be pumped shall be 0.3 MPa and the Grout Pump must have a relief 
arrangement for bypass of the grout incase of buried up of pressure beyond 1 MPA. The 
capacity of the grout pump should be such as to achieve forward speed of grout of around 
5 to 10 metres per minute. The slower rates are Preferable as they reduce the possibility 
of occurrence of voids. If the capacity of the pump is large, it is usual to grout two or more 
cables simultaneously through a common manifold.
Use of hand pumps for grouting is not recommended. Use of Compressed air operated 
equipment for injection is prohibited, as it is likely that there will be some air trapped in 
grout.
3.3	
Water Pump
Before commencement of grouting, a stand by direct feed high pressure water pump should 
be available at site for an emergency. In case of any problem in grouting the ducts, such 
pump shall immediately be connected to the duct and all grout flushed by use of high pressure 
water flushing. It is, therefore, necessary to have adequate storage of clean potable water for 
operation of the water pump for such emergencies.
3.4	
Grout Screen
The grouting equipment should contain a screen having a mesh size of IS:106 (IS:105 if 
sand is used). Prior to introduction into the grout pump, the grout should be passed through 
such screen. This screen should be easily accessible for inspection and cleaning.
3.5	
Connections and Air Vents
Standard details of fixing inlets, outlets and air vents to the sheathing and/or anchorage 
should be followed as recommended by specialist supplier of the system of prestressing. In 
general, all connections are to be of the “Quake couple” type and at change of diameters 
suitable reducers are to be provided.

PROPERTIES OF THE GROUT
4.1 
Water/Cement ratio should be as low as possible, consistent with workability. 
The ratio should not normally exceed 0.45. The temperature of the grout shall not exceed 
25ºC.
4.2 
Before grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested in a laboratory 
depending on the facilities available. Test should be conducted for each job periodically. The 
recommended tests are described below:
 
1) 
Deleterious Materials
 
 
No chloride, sulphates shall be separately added to the grout. The 
constituent may contain chlorides/sulphates. However, its net effect 
should not exceed the following limits in the grout:
 
 
- Chlorides (Cl) not more than 0.1 percent by weight of cement.
 
 
- Sulphate (SO3) not more than 4 percent by weight of cement.
 
 
Sulphide-ions(s) not more than 0.01 percent by weight of cement
	
2.	
Compressive Strength
 
 
The compressive strength of 100 mm cube of the grout shall not be less 
than 27 MPa at 7 days or 30 MPa at 28 days. Cubes shall be cured in 
a moist atmosphere for the first 24 hours and subsequently in water. 
These tests shall be conducted in advance to ascertain the suitability 
of the grout mix. The 7 day strength is not mandatory if the 28 day 
strength requirement is met.
 
1) 
Setting Time
 
 
Initial setting time of grout shall be more than three hours and 
less than 12 hours. The final setting time shall not be less than 24 
hours.
 
2) 
Bleeding
 
 
Bleeding is the separation of free water from the grout mix. It 
includes the filtering effect of strands where the cavities between 
the wires constituting the strand, block cement particles and 
permit water under pressure to move ahead of the grout in the 
direction of general flow of grout. The bleeding shall be sufficiently 
low to prevent excessive segregation and sediment of the grout 
material. The bleeding shall not exceed 0.3 percent of volume of 
the initial volume of grout after three hours kept at rest.
 
3) 
Volume Change
 
 
The volume change of grout kept at rest for 24 hours and tested 
as per ASTM C 1090 shall be within range of 1% and 5 % of the 
original volume.

877
	
4) 
Fluidity
 
 
Fluidity is tested as per ASTM C 939 standard using standard 
flow cone.
Note: 
The fluidity of grout changes from time of mixing to time of setting in the ducts. The 
requirement given above may be modified as per the specific application, depending upon 
the total temperature, length of tendons, head of pumping, requirement of simultaneous 
grouting of closely spaced tendons etc. provided that other specifications and functions 
are satisfied.
5	
MIXING OF GROUT
5.1 
Proportions of materials should be based on field trials made on the grout 
before commencement of grouting, but subject to the limits specified above. The materials 
should be measured by weight.
5.2 
Water should be added to the mixer, first, followed by Portland cement and 
sand, if used. Admixture if any, may be added as recommend by the manufacturer.
5.3 
Mixing time depens upon the type of the mixer, but will normally be between 
2 and 3 minutes. However, mixing should be for such a duration as to obtain uniform and 
thoroughly blended grout, without excessive temperature increase or loss of expansive 
properties of the admixtures. The grout should be continuously agitated until it is injected.
5.4 
Once mixed, no water shall be added to the grout to increase its fluidity.
5.5 
Hand mixing is not permitted.
6	
GROUTING OPERATIONS
6.1	
General
 
a) 
Grouting shall be carried out as early as possible but not later than 
2 weeks of stressing a tendon. Whenever this stipulation cannot be 
complied with for unavoidable reason, adequate temporary protection 
of the steel against corrosion by methods or products which will not 
impair the ultimate adherence of the injected grout should be ensured 
till grouting. The sealing of the anchorage ends after concreting is 
considered to be a good practice to prevent ingress of water. For 
structures in aggressive environment, sealing of the anchorage ends is 
mandatory.
Notes :
i) 
Application of some patented water soluble oils for coating of steel/VPI powder injection/ 
sending in of hot, dry, oil-free compressed air through the vents at frequent intervals have 
shown good results.



======================================================================
PAGE 897 of 903
======================================================================
Appendices
Appendices
878
ii) 
Some of the methods recommended for sealing of anchorages are to seal the openings 
with bitumen impregnated gunny bag or water proof paper or by building a brick pedestal 
plastered on all faces enclosing the exposed wires outside the anchorages.
iii) 
Any traces of oil if applied to steel for preventing corrosion should be removed before 
grouting operation.
iv) 
Ducts shall be flushed with water for cleaning as well as for wetting the surfaces of the 
duct walls. Water used for flushing should be of same quality as used for grouting. It may, 
however, contain about 1 percent of slaked lime or quick lime. All water should be drained 
thorough the lowest vent pipe or by blowing compressed air through the duct.
v) 
The water in the duct should be blown out with oil free compressed air.
 
Blowing out water from duct for cables longer than 50 m draped up at both ends by 
compressed air is not effective. Outlet/ vent provided at or near the lowest point shall be 
used to drain out water from duct.
vi) 
The connection between the nozzle of the injection pipe and duct should be such that air 
cannot be sucked in.
vii) 
All outlet points including vent openings should be kept open prior to commencement of 
injection grout.
viii) 
Before grouting, all air in the pump and hose should be expelled. The suction circuit of the 
pump should be air-tight.
6.2	
Injection of Grout
 
a) 
After mixing the grout should be kept in continuous movement.
 
b) 
Injection of grout must be continuous and should not be interrupted.
 
c) 
For vertical cable or cables inclined more than 60 degrees to the 
horizontal, injection should be effected from the lowest anchorage or 
vent of the duct.
 
d) 
The method of injection should ensure complete filling of the ducts. To 
verify this it is advisable to compare the volume of the space to be filled 
by the injected grout with the quantity of grout actually injected.
 
e) 
Grouting should be commenced initially with a low pressure of injection 
of upto 0.3 MPa increasing it until the grout comes out at the other end. 
The grout should be allowed to flow freely from the other end until the 
consistency of the grout at this end is the same as that of the grout 
at the injection end. When the grout flows at the other end, it should 
be closed off and building up of pressure commenced. Full injection 
pressure at about 0.5 MPa shall be maintained for at least one minute 
before closing the injection pipe. It is recommended practice to provide 
a stand pipe at the highest point of the tendon profile to hold all water 
displaced by sedimentation or bleeding. If there is a built up of pressure 
much in excess of 1 MPa without flow of grout coming at the other 
end; the grouting operation should be discontinued and the entire duct 
flushed with high pressure water. Also, the bypass system indicated in 
para 3.2 above is essential for further safety.

f) 
In the case of cables draped downwards e.g. in cantilever 
construction simultaneous injection from both ends may be adopted. 
Fig. 1800/III-1.
 
g) 
Grout not used within 30 minutes of mixing should be rejected.
 
h) 
Disconnection is facilitated if a short length of flexible tube connects the 
duct and injection pipe. This can be squeezed and cut off after the grout 
has hardened.
7	
PRECAUTIONS 
AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR 
EFFECTIVE 
GROUTING
 
a) 
In cold and frosty weather, injection should be postponed, unless special 
precautions are taken. If frost is likely to occur within 48 hours after 
injection, heat must be applied to the member and maintained for at 
least 48 hours after injection so that the temperature of the grout does 
not fall below 5 degrees Celsius. Prior to commencement of grouting, 
care must be taken to ensure that the duct is completely free of frost/
ice by flushing with warm water, but not with steam.
 
b) 
The temperature of the grout shall not exceed 25 degrees Celsius. For 
increasing the workability of grout, its temperature may be lowered 
by use of chilled water or by putting ice outside the grout storage 
container.
 
c) 
When the cables are threaded after concreting, the duct must be 
temporarily stiffened during concreting by inserting bunch of strands, 
Wires or reinforcement or a rigid PVC pipe or any other suitable 
method.
 
d) 
During concreting, care shall be taken to ensure that the sheathing is 
not damaged. Needle vibrators shall be used with extreme care by well 
experienced staff only, to ensure against such damage.
 
e) 
It is a good practice to move the cables in both directions during the 
concreting operations. This can easily be done by light hammering the 
ends of the wires/strands during concreting. It is also advisable that 
3 to 4 hours after concreting the cable should be moved both ways 
through a distance of about 20 cms. With such movement, any leakage 
of mortar which has taken place in spite of all precautions, loses bond 
with the cables, thus reducing the chance of blockages. This operation 
can also be done by fixing prestressing jacks, at one end pulling the 
entire cable and then repeating the operation by fixing the jack at the 
other end.
 
f) 
The cables to be grouted should be separated by as much distance as 
possible.

Appendices
881
 
g) 
In case of stage prestressing, cables tensioned in the first stage should 
not remain ungrouted till all cables are stressed. It is good practice, 
while grouting any duct in stage prestressing, to keep all the remaining 
ducts filled up with water containing 1 percent lime or by running water 
through such ducts till the grout has set. After grouting the particular 
cable, the water in the other cables should be drained and removed 
with compressed air to prevent corrosion.
 
h) 
Care should be taken to avoid leaks from one duct to another at joints 
of precast members in particular.
 
i) 
End faces where anchorages are located are vulnerable points of 
entry of water. They have to be necessarily protected with an effective 
barrier, Recesses should be packed with mortar concrete and should 
preferably be painted with water proof paint.
 
j) 
After grouting is completed, the projecting portion of the vents should 
be cut off and the face protected to prevent corrosion.
