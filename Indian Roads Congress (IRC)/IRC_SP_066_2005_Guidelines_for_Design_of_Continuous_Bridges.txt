1.2. At its first meeting on 29* April, 2003, the
Committee felt that in the light of the massive
construction programme
that
was
under
executionin the highway sector, it was necessary
to bring out guideUnes on certain topics which were
not adequately covered in the existing IRC Codes
and Standards. The design and construction of
continuous bridges was one of the topics selected.
It was decided that while highlighting the special
design and detailing requirements in each case,
the guidelines would be generally in Line with IRC: 1
and IRC:21 with additional inputs from BS:5400,
EURO
and AASHTO
codes,
wherever
necessary.
1.3. The
initial draft of the guidelines was
prepared by Shri Alok Bhowmick. The draft was
discussed by the B-6 Committee at
its several
meetings and finalized in its meeting held on 3"^
September, 2004. The draft document was
approved by Bridges Specifications and Standards
Committee in its meeting held on 20* December,
2004. The document was considered by IRC
Council in its 173"^ meeting held on 8* January,
2005 in Bangalore and approved subject to certain
modifications. The required modifications were
accordingly carried out by the Convenor, B-6
Committee before sending the doucument for
pubUcation.
2.
SCOPE
The guidelines cover the analysis and design
requirements for the following types of concrete
bridges
a) Continuous Bridges
b) Bridges made continuous through deck
slabs.
The guidelines are applicable for the design
of continuous type of bridges in reinforced concrete

or
in prestressed concrete or precast girder
bridges made fully continuous for superimposed
loads & live load by providing in-situ concrete
diaphragm at support or bridges with tied deck
slabs with continuity provided using dowel bars
debonded from girder at support. It shall be read
in conjunction with the existing provisions in the
relevant IRC Codes.
3.
DEFINITIONS
3.1. Continuous Bridges
Continuous bridge
is
a bridge with the
superstructure longitudinally continuous over
intermediate supports on bearings. There are
several methods of achieving the continuity in
Superstructure. Fig.l shows some of such
methods.
,.
.
3.2. Bridges made Continuous through
Deck Slab
These are bridges built using girders, which
are simply supported, and made continuous through
cast-in-situ deck slab.
4. IMPACT FACTOR
For continuous bridges, the live load impact
factor shall be calculated in accordance with
Clause 211 of IRC:6-2000, wherein the span length
to be considered shall be as under
:
(i)
For bridges with spans of equal effective
length, the effective span length (c/c of pier).
(ii)
For bridges with spans of unequal effective
length, the least effective span length.
(iii) For bridges with only deck continuity, the
effective span on which the load is placed.
5.
CONTINUOUS BRIDGES
5.1. Analysis
5.1.1. Elastic method of analysis shall be used to
determine the forces and deformations, taking into
account all aspects of response of the structure to
loads and imposed deformations.
5.1.2. The effects of creep and shrinkage of
concrete, temperature difference and differential
settlements need not be considered while checking
the safety against ultimate stage failure*"
.
5.1.3. Secondary effects due to hyperstatic
reactions of prestress shall be taken into account
while analyzing the structure. For ultimate stage
checks, the load factor for prestress (including the
hyperstatic effects) shall be taken as 1.0
5.1.4. Due account shall be taken of the change
in nature of the structural system and in material
properties that occur during the construction
sequence of a continuous bridge. The behaviour
at any stage of the construction sequence shall be
analyzed, duly taking into account the effect of
creep redistribution.
5.1.5. The critical section for shear shall be as
follows
(i) When the reaction in the direction of the
applied shear introduces compression into the
end region of the member, sections located at
a distance less than
'd' from the face of the
support may be designed for the same shear
as that computed at distance
'd'.
(ii) When the reaction in the direction of the
applied shear introduces tension into the end
region of the member, shears computed at the
face of the support shall be used in the design
of the member at that section.
5.2. Design
The
design bending moment over an
intermediate support of a continuous deck
supported on bearings may be calculated by
equation'^'
Mj = (M - qaV8) or 0.9M, whichever is greater,
where,
M, = Design bending moment.

5.3. Dimensioning & Detailing
5.3.1. Bearing Layout & Movements: The
selection of the bearing type and the bearing
layout in a continuous structure is an important
task, which shall be estabhshed during the initial
design process itself. The layout of the bearings
shall correspond to the structural analysis of the
whole
structure. The expected bearing
movements and rotations shall be determined
taking into account the sequence of construction.
In case of stage by stage construction, stability
of the partially completed unit shall be ensured
by suitable means, which shall be clearly spelt
out by the designer in the working drawings.
Some of the typical layout ofbearings for various
forms of continuous structures are as shown in
Figs. 3, 4 and 5.
a)
The layout of cover for straight continuous
girders, curved continuous structures - Fig. 4
and skewed continuous structures are shwon
in Figs. 3,4 & 5 respectively.
The arrangement shown in the Fig. 3, 4 and 5
are only indicative and any other layout
/
arrangement of bearings can also be adopted.
Methods of analysis, shall take into account the
bearing orientations to determine the bearing
movements and corresponding forces transferred
to the substructure.
5.3.2. The horizontal earthquake forces that are
being transferred through the fixed bearing in a
continuous bridge
is usually large. There
is a
concentration of stress at the joint and suitable tie
back reinforcement may be necessary
at the
junction of fixed bearing with deck. Additional
reinforcement may be required to be provided

within the influence width, in concrete adjoining
the fixed bearing, which shall be designed to resist
the horizontal force that is transferred through the
bearings. These reinforcements shall be of length
sufficient to ensure proper transfer of force.
Fig.
6 shows a typical detail of such reinforcement.
5.3.3. When couplers are used for extending
prestressing cables, not more than 50 per cent of
the longitudinal post tensioning tendons shall be
coupled at any one section
6. BRIDGES
MADE
CONTINUOUS
THROUGH DECK SLAB
For bridges made continuous through deck
slab, two generic type of connections normally
adopted for different situations are as described
below:
Type
1: Continuous separated deck slab in
which the deck slab is continued monolithically
over the intermediate piers, without continuing the

girders. The length of the separated deck slab
between the girders shall be sufficient to provide
both short-term and long-term flexibility required
to accommodate rotation of the girders.*^* (Fig. 7a
& Fig. 7b).
This type of connection is simple in design
and construction. However
it does not provide
moment continuity at the supports.
Type 2
: Tied deck slab in which the deck slab
is hinged over the pier using partly debonded
doweUing (Fig. 8).
This type of detailing is applicable for short to
medium span lengths and is aimed at minimising
the number of expansion joints and improving riding
quality. However the tied deck joint retains the
rotational capacity, with a sealed notch provided
in the deck surfacing.
It should be noted that bridges made
continuous through deck slab do not provide
moment continuity and thus in terms of structural
action for vertical loads, the bridge can be
a

considered as simply supported for the design of
girders. Hence specific clauses pertaining to
continuous structure do not apply for these
bridges. For lateral loads however, the bridge is
to be treated as continuous. The continuity slab
over pier shall be designed for the forces arising
out of the effect of such continuity, duly taking
into account the effect of rotation of the girders
subsequent to casting of the continuity slab. For
the purpose of design of continuity slab, the
permissible reduction in allowable stress in
reinforcement shall be considered as 80 per cent
to account for fatigue.
In case of bridges with deck continuity, the
detailing of crash barrier for the continuity slab
portion shall be done carefully. Gaps shall be left
in crash barrier at the ends of continuity slab to
allow for flexing of the slab.
