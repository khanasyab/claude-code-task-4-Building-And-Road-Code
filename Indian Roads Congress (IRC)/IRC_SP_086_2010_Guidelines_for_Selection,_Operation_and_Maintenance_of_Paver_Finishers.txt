======================================================================
1. BACKGROUND
IRC:SP:86-2010
Paver finishers were first introduced at the beginning of 1 930 for road construction works.
They were used
for laying
(a) Aggregate layer and
(b) Bituminous
layer. Necessary
modifications in design of the Paver were carried out from time to time based on experience
gained and the need to achieve desired road specifications. Basic function of the Paver is
to spread and pre-compact the aggregates/bituminous mix. Presently, Hydrostatic Paver
Finishers with sensor control device are being used to achieve quality control in respect of
road evenness, desired laying thickness compactable to grading. Pre-1960, Pavers with
fixed screed were in use. Thereafter, floating screed Pavers were introduced.
2. FUNCTION
Following are the main functions of Paver Finisher:
a)
To lay and spread the mix to attain specified surface quality.
b)
To facilitate the attainment of specified surface quality and correct grade to
meet the road design specifications for a safe and comfortable ride.
c)
To achieve specified camber and super elevation in normal reach.
d)
To achieve required thickness, uniform degree of compaction, homogenous
quality of mix during laying and uniform bearing capacity over the entire
surface.
3.
CLASSIFICATION
Paver finishers are classified based on the following factors:
a)
Type of Paver
b)
Type of Traction
c)
Capacity
d)
Mobility
3.1
Type of Paver
The Pavers are classified
into Mechanical and Hydrostatic types based on
a) Control
mechanism for screed elevation via tow point mounting/actuation and b) Control of screed
extension. The hydrostatic drive
is through a variable displacement motor and pump for
infinitely variable paving and travel speed.

IRC:SP:86-2010
3.2
Type of Traction
Two types of traction effort can be applied on Paver finisher, which are based on the design
of tractor unit.
;
;
:
a)
Track Chain Paver Finisher (Fig. 1)
It is mounted on crawler tracks, which shall be provided with a spring tensioning device or
automatic hydraulic track tensioning assembly with suitable rollers, sprockets and idlers,
having adequate lubricating system. The bearing pressure of crawler assembly should not
exceed 22 N/cm^. Following are the features of Track Chain Paver Finisher:
1)
The large contact area of tracks gives good traction effort.
2)
It can be used for laying in large width upto 16 m.
3)
It is more suitable to work on soft or loose sub-bases, difficult under foot
conditions and steep gradient.
4)
There is no slippage on tack coat.

b)
Wheeled Paver Finisher
It is mounted on wheels.
It can have single/double bogie axle wheels in the front and single/
double drive axles in the rear. The bogie wheels are made of steel with moulded rubber and
drive wheels with pneumatic tires which shall be of adequate capacity having good traction
effort. Normally, single drive axle is suitable upto 5 m width and double drive axle upto 8.5 m
width. Wheeled Paver can travel more easily and at higher speeds, therefore, making its use
more convenient and economical. Figs. 2,3 & 4.

======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 52
======================================================================
1RC:SP:86-2010
The Wheeled Paver has the following features:
1 )
It is primarily used on hard surfaces and relatively narrow paving widths.
2)
In Wheeled Paver finisher there are fewer datum sensing points and have
individual effect based on rolling contact length of tires. Thus, the time of
application to tow points is less. Once the wheel has passed the undulations,
it has no further effect on Paver finisher
until the arrival of next wheel.
Therefore, Wheeled Paver finisher is less affected by undulations in the base.
3)
There is time saving in movement from one lane to another and end to end.
4)
Less traction in two wheels drive version can result in slippage on tack coat.
5)
The wear and tear of the tyres is more and causes their frequent replacement.
The Paver finisher whether mounted on tracks or wheels should be powered with an engine
providing sufficient traction effort, while working on a firm unyielding base, to push up a fully
loaded dumper at
1 0 percent gradient.
3.3
Laying Capacity
Laying
capacity of Paver finisher is expressed in tonne per hour.
It depends on following
factors:
a)
Paving speed
b)
Paving width
c)
Mat thickness
d)
Type of material to be paved
e)
Prime mover's output
3.3.1
Paving and travel speed
The paving speed should match with feeding of material in the hopper as well as its laying
on the surface. Table 1 gives the range of paving speed and travel speed available in Paver
Finisher.

Paving widtfi
The screed of the Paver Finisher decides the paving width. Normally, Paver Finishers are
provided with the following screed.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:86-2010
a)
Mechanically Extendable Screed
Mechanically extendable screed needs bolt on extension boxes for larger width. The extension
needs shims for alignment of bottom plate. The Paver finisher using such screed is known
as Mechanical Paver Finisher, in which
screed width
is 2.5 m with mechanical extension
upto4.0m.
The Paver having minimum
1 .5 m screed width can be used for hill roads and shoulders on
other roads.
b)
Hydraulically Extendable Screed (Fig. 5)
Hydraulically extendable screed is telescopic, operated through hydraulic pump.
In Hydrostatic Paver Finisher, the basic width of the screed is 2.5 to 3.0 m with infinite variable
hydraulic screed width normally upto 6.0 m.
It can further be extended upto 10 m with the
provision of screed extensions.
For Hydrostatic Paver for paving width beyond 10 m, Mechanical Screeds with heating system
upto 16 m width are also available, Fig. 6.

IRC:SP:86-2010
3.3.3
Paving thickness
The following paving thickness is normally possible for laying the mix.
a)
Mechanical Paver finisher
10 mm to 200 mm
b)
Hydrostatic Paver finisher
:
10 mm to 350 mm
3.3.4
Type of material to be paved
-
The Paver should be capable of laying any of the following types of materials
:
a)
Aggregate mixes such as wet mix macadam.
'
b)
Bituminous mixes, such
as, bituminous macadam, dense bituminous
macadam, semi-dense bituminous concrete, bituminous concrete, etc.
In case paving width requirement
is 8 m and above,
it
is recommended to use Tracked
Paver for better control over traction and pavement quality also.
3.3.5
Prime mover's output
The prime mover fitted on the Paver Finisher should be diesel engine of repute make, with
adequate capacity conforming to IS/BIS/DIN Standards.
3.3.6
Output of paver finislier
Output of the Paver Finisher (lay down rate) is measured in tonnes per hour and depends on
the following factors:
a)
Width being paved
b)
Thickness being paved
c)
Paving speed
d)
Density of mix
The time to complete the paving operation during specified period plays an important role
on the output of Paver finisher. The output of different types of Paver finisher is in the following
range:
1)
Mechanical Paver Finisher
Upto 100 tonnes per hour
2)
Hydrostatic Paver Finisher
Upto 700 tonnes per hour
It
is essential that paver stoppages should be minimum during paving operation. More
frequency of stoppages will result in poor riding quality and surface finish of the pavement
being laid.
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:86-2010
The requirement of Paver Finisher on a specific project shall depend on the frequency
and distance to which the Paver is to be shifted from one site to other.
It is recommended
that a wheeled Paver be used,
if there is frequent shifting involved during the execution of
paving job.
4.
PAVER COMPONENTS AND THEIR FUNCTION
The Paver consists of following two units (Fig. 7):
a)
Tractor Unit
b)
Screed Unit
Tractor is the front part of Paver Finisher, which houses the prime mover, conveyors, augers,
hydraulic system, operator's cabin and driving system. The primary function of the tractor is
to propel the tipper, to convey and distribute the paving material through the augers and tow
the screed. The main components and functions of tractor unit of the Paver Finisher are as
under:
..-..^m-,.
.
a)
Pushing Rollers
The front end of the main frame of the tractor are equipped with two cylindrical steel rollers
with adjustable height and oscillation arrangement, properly spaced to contact the rear wheel
of tipper, when feeding premixed material from tipper
into the receiving hopper of Paver
finisher (Fig. 8 & Fig. 9).

Pushing roller
Fig. 8 Components of Tracked Paver Finisher
Fig. 9 Main Components of Tractor Unit of Paver Finisher
b)
Receiving Hopper and Feeding Conveyor
1)
The size of the hopper should be adequate. Larger size of hoppers can
accept larger quantities of mix which helps to keep the mix hot for longer
period. Besides, a larger size of hopper enables the Paver to continue the
work, even when the tippers are being interchanged.
2)
The Paver finisher shall be provided with a wear resistant steel hopper to
receive the material directly from tippers. The hopper for the Paver finisher
shall have two bar (slat) type conveyors with variable hydrostatic drive
arrangement for independent traction transmission and
their individual
operation.
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 52
======================================================================
|RC:SP:86-2010
3)
The floor of the hopper shall be constructed of abrasion resistant steel plate.
The size of the hopper shall consist of wings so arranged, that each hopper
wing may be individually raised or lowered by hydraulic ram to a position
within the Paver's overall width for travel or to prevent accumulation of material
in the corners of the hopper. This is essential as the material in contact with
any outside part of the Paver tends to cool more rapidly.
4)
The conveyor moves the premixed material from hopper to rear of the
machine in front of spreading augers. The speed and size of the conveyors,
governs the capacity of a Paver. The volume of material moved is controlled
by variable speed conveyor motors. The feed is controlled using either limit
switches or non contact type ultrasonic sensors which automatically control
the conveyors on either side independently, to ensure even flow of material
to the screed so that surging is avoided and the required "Head of Material"
maintained constantly.
NOTE:
For large production jobs, where large widths have to be paved and high tonnage
laid accurately, non contact type ultrasonic sensors should be used for controlling
conveyors, unlike old design pavers which are fitted with contact type ON-OFF
limit switches (for controlling the slat conveyors and augers).
c)
Auger System
The Paver finisher should be provided with two spreading augers having independent drives
/
and capable of distributing the material evenly, delivered by the bar (slat) type conveyor over
the desired width to be surfaced. The material for augers shall be Ni-hard steel, which shall
be hydraulically operated.
It
is possible to raise or lower the augers mechanically or
hydraulically, to suit the varying layer thickness.
The auger system consists of two types:
1)
Both screw conveyors driven by a central gear unit (Fig. 10),
2)
The augers driven by separate drive units at the outer end of the shafts.

IRC:SP:86-2010
The direction of screws of auger system shall be as follows:
Two screws can rotate in opposite directions (one auger shall have a right hand thread and
other left hand thread) allowing the material to be conveyed in different direction
:
1)
From the center to the side
ii)
From the sides to the center
iii)
Over full width of the screed
Reverse direction auger flights, one each on either side, should be provided at the middle to
ensure positive head (pressure) of material at the center of the augers so as to avoid any
"segregation" at the center.
The capacity of auger is governed by its diameter, pitch of the flights and maximum revolutions
per minute.
Optional:
Contact less ultrasonic sensors are provided at auger ends (out board position) of the screed
to ensure smooth material flow as shown in Fig.11
. The function and advantages of contactless
ultra sonic sensor in the Paver finisher are as under:
a)
The sensor does not come in contact with material.
b)
Smooth material flow can be controlled by the operator by turning a knob
placed on, outside the governor.
c)
Quantity of material can be controlled via auger.
d)
It allows smooth and desired quantity of material flow to screed
in best
possible manner.

For large production jobs, contactless type ultrasonic sensors may be used in receiving hopper
and feeding conveyor system to control augers for better control of material flow.
4.2
Screed Unit
It is the most important part of paving machine which lays and finishes the mat surface to the
desired profile, grade and slope. The screed unit consists of
:
a)
Screed
b)
Two tow arms
c)
Mat thickness adjustment mechanism
The screed is attached to the Paver by two arms at the tow points on each side of the Paver.
The screed is mounted to the tow arms at each screed pivot point as shown in Fig. 12.
Fig. 12
Function of Screed and its Angle of Attack
4.2.1
Function of screed
The function of the screed is to strike off the material in preparation for further compaction,
as shown in the Fig. 12.
The screed on Paver is
"floating,
self leveling" type. As the Paver tows the screed unit
forward, paving material flows under the screed. This causes the screed to float on the mat
of the material, thus establishing mat thickness as shown
in Fig. 12. Since, the screed
is
mounted to the Paver only at tow points, the screed is completely free to float up or down.
The screed will always seek its own "Planning Angle, or Angle of Attack"
, depending on the
combination of forces acting upon the screed.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:86-2010
The key to the leveling performance of the screed
is to
fill
in low spots and decrease the
influence of high spots, thus acting as an averaging device (Fig. 13). As the screed's angle
of attack changes, the mat thickness also varies. The amount of self leveling is determined
by the length of the tow arms and the wheel base of the Paver. A longer wheel base and
longer tow arms tend to increase the Paver's ability to average high and low spots in new
mat surface.

4.2.1.1
Major forces acting upon a floating, self-leveling screed
Major forces acting upon the screed are shown in Fig.1 4. The key element of smooth pavement
is to keep these forces as constant as possible. Change in any of these forces will result in
change of screed angle of attack ultimately affecting the mat thickness as per details shown
below:
P
-
Pulling Force
The tractor unit's primary function is to provide motive force to the machine, move
it forward,
convey and distribute the paving material in front of the screed. Force -P will remain constant
if the total resistance to forward motion is constant.
If any component of the forces resisting
forward motion
is changed, such as a) Tipper bumping b) Holding tipper's brakes
c) A
significant change in head of material and
d) Changing the width of an extendable screed;
the total forces resisting forward motion will change and result in change of Paver speed
. As
a consequence of change
in Paver speed, the screed
will tend
to rise or fall (Fig. 14).
Therefore,
it is essential to maintain a constant paving speed to minimise the fluctuations in
the pulling force.
If change
in speed
is unavoidable,
it should be made as gradually as possible. This will
stretch the effect of changes in screed forces over a longer paving distance and reduce mat
irregularities. The proper paving speed is reached when the amount of material being placed
matches the material delivery rate at the site.

Weight of Screed
Weight of screed-W, or downward pressure exerted by the screed on the paving material
should remain constant. The downward pressure of the screed, can be significantly altered
during the paving operation by three common changes.
The extendable screed weight remains the same, whether used
in fully retracted or fully
extended mode. However, the wider the extension of the screed, the greater shall be the
surface area of paving material to support the screed. Therefore, force of screed on mat
surface (kg/cm^) will vary with changes in screed width, ultimately affecting the mat thickness.
Reaction
of Material under Screed
Ideally, material delivered by every tipper to the Paver would be exactly the same. However,
it has been observed in practice that changes in mix characteristics such as mix temperature,
density, gradation, fines etc. will affect the internal stresses developed within the mix, which
in turn affects the resistance of the mix to the weight of the screed. The screed passing over
the paving material will compact
it to a certain degree. Variations in the resistance of the
material to compaction forces will cause change in screed's angle of attack, which in turn will
affect mat thickness and its smoothness. The reaction of the material under the screed will
be normal to the surface.
The forces H and V represent the net of the resolved components of the forces (Reaction,
Friction and Shearing) acting on the screed.

4.2.1.2
Head of material
The primary function of the Paver tractor is to convey and distribute paving material onto the
ground in front of the entire width of the screed. The screed will pass over the head of the
material deposited in front of the screed. For smooth paving, the head of material should be
maintained as constant as possible. The head of material affecting the height of screed is
shown in Fig. 15.
If head of material is too low,
screed is forced downwards
If head of material is too high,
screed is forced upwards
Ideal
condition
If 2/3
auger is covered with material, total forces acting on
screed are in equilibrium and it maintains the desired level

Screed assist system
a
Compaction Effect
The compaction effect of a screed is determined by
:
1)
Screed weight and contact area of tamping or vibrating element
Harsh mixes and stabilized gravel require heavy screed to achieve desired
pre-compaction and uniform even surface; while tender bituminous mixes in
which screed has a tendency to sink, need light screed. The contact area of
compacting element determines the compaction force on a certain unit area.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 52
======================================================================
I IRC:SP:86-2010
The tamper should have a small contact area to achieve good compaction
effect.
Paving speed
Higher the paving speed, lesser shall be the number of tamper impacts per
unit area, ultimately lower shall be the density achieved.
Frequency and amplitude of tamping unit and screed plate
Tamping Unit:
The tamping bars, provided all along the length of the screed, are steel bars
with chamfered edges, which provide pre compaction to the mix being paved.
The tamper bars move up and down vertically with an amplitude between 3
to 5 mm. They operate at a frequency between 0-2000 strokes per minute,
which should be infinitely adjustable within this range (Fig. 16).
All wearing parts of the tamping unit should be made of high heat and wear
resistance
alloy steel and
easily replaceable
(Fig.
17). An adjustment
mechanism should be provided to obtain the optimum position of the tamping
bars with respect to screed plates as they wear out. The tamping action
shall provide sufficient initial compaction to the material. The tamping bar
shall be operated hydraulically. The inclined tamping stroke in comparison
to vertical one gives better compaction effect and reduces the tendency
towards crushing the aggregate as shown in Fig. 18.

NOTE:
On high quality and precision jobs, the Paver finisher should be equipped with an

for tamper to achieve the desired/preset frequency) during stopping and starting
of the Paver to eliminate crushing of aggregates and related mat defects.

Vibration System of Screed Plate:
I
^
This
is necessary to smootlien out the tamper edge marks on the pre
compacted mat and provide additional compaction and smooth finish to
it. A
hydraulically operated system, capable of providing low amplitude, high
frequency vibration
to the screed
plates
shall be provided. A variable
frequency ranging from 0 to 3700 vibrations per minute normally achieves
the optimum frequency in relation to mat thickness, density, working speed
and material specification.
4)
Physical Condition of Compacting Elements
New screed plate or tamper will produce the best pre-compaction effect and
surface evenness. In case screed plate/tamper is worn out due to their use,
the compaction effect shall be reduced, resulting in an open textured mat.
Thus, the same should be replaced.
b)
Heating System
This system
is provided to preheat the screed plate and tamper, to desired temperature
before starting the paving of hot bituminous mixes which prevent the bitumen picking up or
sticking
. There are three types of heating devices a) Diesel/Oil fired burners b) Gas burners
c) Electrical heaters.
Gas is a cleaner and gentler device provided on baffle plate. Safety device may be provided
to protect the crew against risk of explosion.
Electrical heating system requires an extra generator.
It is power consuming and slower as
compared
to other systems.
It takes approximately 45 minutes to reach the operating
temperature. The choice of system will depend on the supply of fuel and selection of purchaser.
The screed
is required to heated
before putting
it to use. Thereafter
it
is heated by the
temperature of the Hot Mix.
c)
Screed Assist System
This system provides partial neutralization of screed load and ensures constant pressure of
the screed on the mix regardless of the bearing capacity of mix and width being paved.
It
also enables transferring part of the screed weight to the drive axle/tracks of the machine, in
order to avoid spinning of the wheels/tracks under adverse gradients or underfoot conditions.
4.2.1.3
Adjustment of screed
a)
The screed shall be so carried and drawn over the material that
it will maintain
the required grade level and profile and will not be affected by sudden or
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:86-2010
minor changes in the level of the base layer, over which the material is being
paved. The screed shall be equipped with mechanism for adjusting the angle
of attack. The height of tow points to which the side arms are attached shall
be hydraulically adjustable to enable the changes in the angle of attack during
operation. The required thickness being laid is achieved by varying the angle
of attack of the screed either manually or automatically by longitudinal and
transverse electronic leveling devices (grade controller and slope controller
respectively), attached to the screed.
b)
For paving width upto 6 m the basic screed shall be hydraulically extendable,
so that the width of the mat is infinitely variable between the minimum and
maximum specified width. The telescopic system of the hydraulic extensions
shall have independent operating guide cylinders (to have higher stability/
rigidity of the hydraulic screed extensions,
it shall be preferred to have two
such telescopic guide cylinders on each side). Screed extensions must have
the arrangement for compaction such as tamper and vibration and also
provision for heating.
c)
For paving width between 6.00 and 10.00 m, suitable mechanical screed
extensions, auger extensions, strengthening and locking devices fitted with
tampers, vibrators and heating system must be provided.
d)
For paving widths more than 10 m, a fixed screed
(mechanical type)
comprising of mechanical extension pieces, each equipped with tampers,
vibration, heating system and suitable tensioning system (using tie-bars or
hydraulic system) for rigid locking of screed elements should be provided.
e)
All screed wear parts coming into contact with material being paved, shall
be constructed from abrasion resistant steel and shall be replaceable.
f)
To facilitate travel of the Paver during shifting, a hydraulic system shall be
provided to raise the screed unit by a power operated hydraulic ram or similar
device to a raised position clear of the road surface. Mechanical locks shall
be provided for holding the screed
in the raised position while moving the
Paver from one working point to another.
4.2. 1.4
Adjustment of screed plate for normal crossfall/superelevation
The screed plate can be adjusted at the centre through its a) Leading b) Trailing edge. Leading
edge of screed plate should be provided with slightly more crown, to ensure better flow of
material to trailing edge. Adjustment of screed plate
is done while paving and set at that
point, where best surface texture of mat behind Paver is achieved (Fig. 19).

AUTOMATIC LEVELLING CONTROL SYSTEM
This system consists of electronic sensing instruments fitted on Hydrostatic Paver finisher
which automatically controls the mat thickness for precision laying.
5.1
Operation of Automatic Leveling Control System
Basically, automatic leveling control system can be operated in two ways,
a)
Surface String Line System
In this method, the grade reference is established by erecting a string line with the help of
nylon stretched wire and grade shakes to the desired level of the profile by a survey crew on
one side of the pavement. A vane fitted to the sensor remains in contact with tensioned wire
and transmits signals to the control system as shown in Fig. 21
. The accuracy of string line
system depends on the accuracy of fixing tensioned wire. The string line should be supported
by grade stakes not more than 8 m apart and proper amount of tension maintained to keep
it true without sagging.

b)
Sonic System
It is a non contacting grade control system based on sonic pulses in which pulses of high
frequency sound are sent and the time for the echoes reflected from physical objects are
measured. The speed of sound calculates the exact distance of the object. The control box
based on this evaluated information raises or lowers the tow point cylinders and maintains
proper mat thickness.
5.2
Components of Automatic Leveling Control System
Following are the components of Automatic leveling control system:
a)
Control Box - 2 no.
It is fitted on both sides of the Paver finisher, receives the signals from sensors
(elevation
control sensor/slope sensor), determines the correction in grade or slope and transmits the
signals to the valves, controlling the tow point cylinders on each side of machine, which
raises or lowers them thus maintaining correct mat thickness.
b)
Elevation Control Sensor
- 2 no.
It controls the grade or slope with respect to a reference surface, automatically maintains the
height of screed and layer thickness of the material. The reference level should be as leveled
as possible, to achieve the best result. Elevation control sensor either in sonic/string line
sends the information to the control box, which evaluates and raises or lowers the tow point
cylinder to maintain proper mat thickness.
c)
Slope Sensor
- 1 no.
It is a precision electronic sensor which functions like a precision carpenter's level.
It maintains
the specified left and right hand cross slope of the mat during laying.
It detects any deviation

in inclination
(tilt) of the screed from a preset cross slope and sends the signals to both
control boxes to restore the original setting.
d)
Junction Box
- 2 no.
Its primary function is to route power from paving machine to control box, correction signals
from elevation control sensor or slope sensor to control box and corrected signals from control
box to hydraulic valves of paving machine.

6.1
Construction of Transverse Joint
It can be made in two ways:
a)
By cutting the road end section perpendicular to
the mat known as

front of the Paver, where paving operation is to be completed.
b)
The mix material coming out from the Paver, can be used to support the
wooden block as well as formation of ramp.
c)
The wooden block and the ramp already laid shall be removed on subsequent
day, before commencement of work. Thereafter, the material is laid with the
help of a paver.

MAT QUALITY CONTROL
The basic purpose of bitumen Paver is to lay a smooth mat of material. The function of the
sensor control is to adjust the vertical and lateral movement of screed in relation to the surface
being paved. The mat quality depends not only on the sensor control but on other factors
also.
a)
Continuous Operation of Paver
The Paver should be allowed to work continuously,
It should not be allowed to wait for the
tippers for unloading the mix during laying.
In case the Paver stops every time, the forces
acting upon the screed are severely disturbed resulting in the screed to settle down in fresh
mat and leave a mark. During restarting the Paver, the material force against the screed will
increase, causing the screed to rise.
It takes approximately 3 to 4 tow arm lengths for the
screed to restabilise at the previous planned angle with a resultant bump. Thus, the Paver
speed should match the rate of material delivery to allow continuous operation of Paver and
eliminate its starting and stopping.
b)
Constant Speed of Paver
The Paver should move continuously, uninterrupted to produce smooth, seamless pavement.
An abrupt change in paving speed causes an immediate disturbance in the balance offerees
acting upon the screed. Sometimes
it is not possible to maintain constant forward speed of
Paver;
in such cases the interruptions should be minimised and change in paving speed
carried out gradually to achieve smoother finished mat.
c)
Excliange of Tipper
The exchange of tipper should be carried out as smoothly as possible to avoid disturbing the
27



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:86-2010
smooth, uninterrupted forward motion of the Paver. The following precautions should be taken
in this connection:
1 )
The mix delivery tipper should be stopped close but not too short of the Paver.
The Paver should be allowed to pick up tipper for shifting of mix during running.
2)
Never allow tipper to bump the Paver.
3)
The applying and holding the brakes of tippers excessively while dumping
their load may cause the Paver to slow down which
in turn will cause the
screed to rise. The tipper driver should apply only light pressure on the brakes
sufficient to maintain contact with the Paver.
4)
Avoid tippers pulling away prior to completely dumping
all material
in the
hopper.
d)
Constant Head of Material
The head of material should be maintained across the entire width of screed and the material
should cover approximately 2/3rd auger screw as shown in Fig. 30.
If the head of material is
too high, the resistance to forward travel increases and the screed starts to rise resulting in
the formation of ridge in the mat and excessive wear on augers. In case the head of material
is low, the screed will settle because there is not enough material to support
it.
Ideal condition
If 2/3'"'' Auger screw is covered with material, total forces acting on the screed are in
equilibrium and it maintains the desired level of screed

Segregation
It is a material deficiency caused by separations of larger size aggregates
from the bulk of paving material.

3)
Mix temperature
The temperature of the mix should be uniform while dumping
it from the tipper
to hopper of Paver, for which following precautions should be observed:
-
All tippers should take the shortest and most practical route to the Paver.
-
Ensure all tippers take the same route to the Paver. All tippers arrive in
same order, in which they were loaded at hot mix plant.
-
No bunching of tippers should occur at the Paver. The "lay down rate"
should match the material delivery rate.
f)
Screed Compaction
The Paver must be maintained in sound mechanical condition to deliver a smooth mat.
g)
Quality of Base being Paved
In case there are undulations in base being paved, the affected stretch should be paved in
multiple lifts, to increase the averaging effect of screed.
8.
LAYING OF BITUMEN MIX
It is the normal practice to lay the bitumen mix from Paver finisher by discharging the mix
from tipper to receiving hopper of Paver, with its transfer to conveyor, auger screw and screed.
There is a pair of free running push rollers in the front of hopper of Paver Finisher, which
remains in contact with rear tyres of delivery tipper during unloading of mix from tipper to
Paver Finisher. The tipper deposits the mix in receiving hopper of Paver in a steady flow
manner, while Paver is in motion slowly pushing the tipper ahead of it.
Some times due to bumping of tipper with pushing rollers of Paver, insufficient material in
hopper of tipper; the screed is adversely affected due to change of various forces acting on
it and mat surface gets undulations.
IVIobile Feeder (Fig. 31):
To avoid the above situation, an equipment known as Mobile feeder can be inducted between
tipper and Paver Finisher.
It is a transport and conveying system which
is used as a non-
contact connecting element between Paver finisher and tipper to carry out mixed material.
The equipment mainly consists of engine, hopper, conveyor and hydraulic system. The hopper
of mobile feeder is used to store the mix material. The hopper wings can be folded up for
better emptying and even distribution of mix material. The mix material is transported on a
heat- resistant rubber type belt conveyor, which leads the material to a sensor controlled,
automatically height adjusted conveyor belt at the front end of the feeder.
It prevents the mix
from cooling down and from segregation. Normally, the capacity of hopper is 20-30 tonnes.

IRC:SP:86-2010
For transportation of mobile feeder on a truck, the conveyor along with foldable sun roof can
be lowered down. The mobile feeder is commonly used for construction of roads in Europe,
Canada and USA.

Mobile Feeder
Truck Hitches (Fig. 32)
:
Truck hitches (Fig. 32) are used to keep the truck in contact with the paver, to keep
it from
rolling away. The Paver operator controls the truck hitches.
Truck hitches hold the truck
against the paver. The truck must back in straight to avoid the truck hitch popping a tyre.
On the front of the Paver are the push rollers (Fig. 33) and the truck hitches. The truck rests
against the push rollers as the Paver is pushing
it while paving. The rollers must be kept
clean and be free to rotate while pushing the truck.

9. MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF PAVER FINISHER
Proper maintenance and upkeep of Paver finisher shall lead to its longer life, avoidance of
frequent breakdown,
i.e. saving
in unnecessary expenses
for stoppage
of work and
replacement of components. Following measures should be taken in this regard.
a)
Follow the instructions given in the manufacturer's maintenance manual.
b)
The schedule for routine maintenance given below should be observed.
1) Daily schedule.
2) Weekly schedule (50-60 hours operation)
3) Monthly schedule (200-250 hours operation)
4) Quarterly schedule (800-1 000 hours operation)
Periodical overhauling should also be carried out based on manufacturer's
guidelines.
c)
Sufficient quantity of fast moving spare parts and P.O.L. should be available
in the store.
d)
Necessary action for procurement of spare parts likely to be worn out in near
future should be taken in advance, to avoid equipment remaining idle.
e)
The tools required
for day
to day maintenance and on other specific
jobs, should be made available
at works
site, as per manufacturer's
recommendations.
f)
In case Tracked Pavers is to move more than 250 m,
it is suggested to use
a trailor rather than to move the machine on
its own power. The wear and
tear of rubber pads on crawler shoes should be avoided, due to
its high
travel speed.
