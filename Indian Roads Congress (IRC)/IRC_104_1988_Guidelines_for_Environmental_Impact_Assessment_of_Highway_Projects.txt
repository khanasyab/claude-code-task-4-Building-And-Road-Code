GENERAL
1.1.
The Council of the Indian
Roads
Congress
in
their
meeting
held
on
1st December, 1972 had set up a Committee to
study
the
subject of Highway Environment and Pollution.
The
Committee had constituted two
panels
one
for
Environmental
Impact
Statement
(E.I.S.)
for
Non-urban
Roads and other for
Urban
Roads.
Three
case
studies,
Delhi-Palwal
Section
of
National Highway No.
2, Delhi-Meerut Section of State Highway
No. 45 and Ring Road between Indraprastha Estate and
Dhaula
Kuan for the Preparation
of Environmental
Impact
Statement
had been completed by the School of Planning and
Architecture
and
one
case Study of 40 km stretch
of National Highway No.
47, on the Northern and
Southern
side
of Trivandrum
for the
E.I.S. had been completed by National Transportation
Planning
and Research
Centre.
In
light
of
the reports
prepared
as
a
result of the
case
studies,
the
draft
Manual

The draft prepared
by the
Committee
was
discussed
by the Specifications and Standards Committee in
their
meeting
held at New
Delhi
on
the
28th
August,
1986.
The Committee
noted
that
after
the
draft
was
prepared,
the
Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986 has
come
into
force
and
the
draft
did
not
contain
the
quantification
of standard
of
noise,
air
and
environmental pollution and, therefore, would not help much
in
finalising new projects.
The
Convenor
stated
that
a
question-
naire
need
to be added to take care of the points and
quantified
factors to take care of environment factors, and
the
Committee
decided that the draft should be revised by the group
under
the
Chairmanship of the Convenor of the Committee.
1.3.
The draft prepared by
Shri
K.
Arunachalam
under
the guidance of the
Convenor
was
discussed
by
the Highway
Specifications and Standards Committee
in their meeting held at
New
Delhi
on
the 21st September, 1988 and Committee desired
that the document should be redrafted on the basis of
the
com-
ments of
the members by Shri K. Arunachalam
assisted
by
the
Member-Secretary and finalised by the Convenor. The document
finalised by them
got
the
approval
of the Executive Committee
and
the
Council
in
their meetings held on the
16th November,
and 10th December, 1988 respectively.
1.4.
These guidelines supplements the IRC
: SP
: 19 ''Manual
for Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road Projects" in so
far as environmental
assessment
are
concerned
and should be
read in continuation of that manual.

INTRODUCTION
2.1.
Highway network
is one of the important components
of
transportation
system at the National, State and local
levels.
In order to increase the efficiency of
the
transportation
system,
construction
of new
roads and improvements to existing roads
are being undertaken in urban and rural areas.
Construction of
highways
is often coupled with environmental
deterioration.
It
is
not
only
important
but
essential
at
planning stage itself to
consider environmental impact of the proposed
highway
works.
In
the
case
of major works on existing highways, the impact of
these works on the surroundings should be studied and
attempts
should be made to enhance
the
environmental
quality
through
improvements.
2.2.
The increase in public concern regarding "quality
of
life" has intensified the need for rational identification, measure-
2



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 36

ment
and
evaluation
of environmental
impacts.
In
order to
achieve
the
desired harmony between the road and its surroun-
dings,
it becomes necessary to study the environmental effects
at
the
planning
stage
itself.
At present, in the course of planning
and designing a highway the
main
aspects
taken
into
account
are those of economy and traffic flow. As a result of this limited
approach,
many
environmental
problems
such
as
noise,
air
pollution,
aesthetic deterioration and ecological disturbance that
get created are overlooked.-
Such problems can
be
avoided
if
their cause and effects are understood at the planning
stage
and
remedial measures incorporated during the design phase.
2.3.
The factors influencing the environment can
be
con-
sidered in three categories.
The first category
"traffic
factors,',
comprises
those
that
arise from the actions and characteristics
of the traffic, viz. noise, air pollution and vibration.
The second
category, "highway factors", include visual intrusion,
severence,
land consumption and change in
land
access
which,
although
affected
by
traffic,
exist
irrespective
of
use
of
the
highway.
Under the third category fall the noise and air
pollution
arising
as a
result
of construction activities
The guidelines contained
in this publication are based on current
knowledge
and
experi-
ence.
The
noise
and
air
pollution
can
be
related
to riding
quality
of
the
road,
traffic
volumes, speeds and distances, but
vibration
levels
are
more
difficult to predict.
Visual intrusion
usully has to be subjectively assessed at sites or from photographs,
drawings and sketches.
2.4.
It
is
observed
that
the
methodologies
for
assessing
environmental impact developed in other
countries, can
not
be
applied in their original form under Indian conditions.
Keeping
in view the principal objectives, data resource and availability of
technically equipped personnel for preparation of the assessment
for new and existing highways, a combination of
subjective
and
conjective procedure
is suggested.
3.
OBJECTIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
ASSESSMENT (EIA)
3.1.
The
environmental
impact
assessment
has
become
an integral part of the highway
planning
and
design
in many
advanced
countries.
The
main
purpose
of EIA is to identify
environmental impacts of the project and the alternatives, weigh
their significance,
propose
possible
mitigating
treatments
and
provide
necessary
information
for
making
decision
whether
the project
is acceptable from environmental angle or not.

IRC
:
104-1988
3.2.
The case for introducing such a tool in this country
is
even stronger, as many new highway projects are
being
planned
and/or implemented at State and Central Government
levels
in
the
wake
of
rapid
development
in
the country.
It is vital to
ensure that these new/improved highways are not only safer
and
more efficient but are also environmentally acceptable.
3.3.
However, considering the paucity of information
and
non-availability
or
adequate
technical
expertise to perform the
task of preparing such assessments
it will be necessary to simplify
the same initially.
Subsequently, with advancement in the
field,
the procedure could be refined to make
it a more comprehensive
and sharper instrument to evaluate critically various
alternatives
and compare them.
4.
SCOPE
4.1.
This publication provides guidelines on
the
prepara-
tion of EIA for highway projects involving either construction of
a new road or major improvements to an
existing
road.
These
guidelines
assist
in
(i)
providing
useful information about the
possible
environmetnal impacts of the project,
(ii) assessing and
evaluating alternatives directed towards choice
of
the
environ-
mentally acceptable one which
is also economically feasible, and
(iii) identifying mitigating measures for incorporation in the pro-
ject proposals.
4.2.
The procedures for environmental impact
assessment
given in this publication are
for
general
guidance of
engineers
preparing
highway
projects
and
not
for
any administrative
action.
It is intended that the assessment will be required
only
for major highway projects,
in
particular,
construction
of new
highways.
Also, the extent of investigations and
data
coverage
will
depend
on
the
size
and importance of the project and
its
anticipated impact on
the
environment.
Where EIA
is
to
be
prepared for a project,
it is recommended that the project autho-
rities have close interaction with the Department of Environment
and Forests.
4.3.
Section 5 of this publication gives
the
procedure
for
environmental assessment and
provides
formats
for
recording
baseline data, evaluation of alternatives
and
assessment
of
the
environmental impact of the chosen alternatives.
Section 6 pro-
vides an approach to data collection and evaluation
for
prepar-
ing the EIA as also measures for mitigating the adverse impacts.

4.4.
It
may
be
noted
that
the
science of assessment
of
environmental impact of highway projects
is still
in
its infancy
in the country, and for many features there
is
no alternative but
to
resort
to
subjective
assessment
for the present.
However,
with more experience and information from results
of
research,
it will be possible to refine the assessment
procedures
to
make
the EIA a more positive tool.
Towards
this
end,
this
publica-
tion would need to be revised in course of time.

APPROACH TO DATA COLLECTION AND
INVESTIGATIONS FOR PREPARING E.I.A.
AND MITIGATING MEASURES
6. 1
.
General
6.1.1.
For preparing a highway project,
surveys and inves-
tigations are usually conducted in different stages.
First
is
the
Reconnaissance Survey** during which a number
of
alternative
alignments are studied on maps/drawings/photographs, etc., and
then
investigated
in
the
field.
During
this phase, information
on terrain, topographic
features,
soils, materials, drainage, etc.,
are
collected
and
analysed.
A
plan-profile
drawing
to
the
scale of 1:50,000
is
also
prepared.
Based
on the information,
the alternative alignments are
evaluated
alongwith
cost
factors
so as to enable the
choice
of
the
most
suitable
alignment
for
further
detailed
investigations.
The
collected
information,
analysis of
alternatives
and
recommendations
are presented in
the Reconnaissance Report.
6.1.2.
The
time
of
reconnaissance
survey
is
considered
appropriate for
collecting
information
for
preparation
of
the
draft E.I.A.
The
draft
E.I.A. should be prepared side by side
**See IRC SP
: 19 "Manual for Survey, investigation and Preparation of Road
Projects" for survey procedures, data to be collected, etc.
14



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 36
======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
the with the Rconnaissance
Report
so
that
both
are
evaluated
together for selection of the most appropriate alignment/route on
which more detailed investigations in the
Preliminary
Survey**
phase are to
be
conducted.
The
draft
E.I. A.
should
then
be
finalised based on any new information
coming
forth
from
the
Preliminary Survey.
6.2.
Investigations
6.2.1.
The degree of impact of
road
construction
on
the
different environmental aspects vary depending
on
factors
such
as the types of area (urban or rural), the terrain (plain, rolling or
hilly), the land-use pattern of the
area
(residential,
educational,
industrial, etc.)-
For
example, road construction in the hills
is
beset with problems like landslides, soil
erosion,
etc
, which are
of serious environmental consequences.
In residential and other
urban areas, quality of air, noise pollution, proper
traffic
circu-
lation and the like are more important.
In the rural areas where
speeds are high,
it
is more a question of
having
an
aesthetically
pleasing alignment
fitted
gracefully
into
the
surroundings and
providing
pleasing
visual
experience.
Where
a
road
has
to
pass through forest land, obtaining necessary clearance from
the
Department
of
Forests
and
Wildlife
is
important.
Thus,
depending
on
the
situation,
the
aspects
requiring
detailed
study
should
be
identified
and
the
investigations
organised
accordingly.
6.2.2.
It
is
desirable
that the investigations for preparing
E.I. A. are conducted by a multi-disciplinary team
comprising
a
Highway/Traffic
Engineer,
an
Environmental
Specialist and an
Horticulturist.
For roads
in
urban
areas,
a
Town
Planner
should be included.
Similarly, for roads in the hills, a Geologist/
Gpetechnical Engineer should be included.
6.2.3.
Investigations for the existing roads
6.2.3.1.
Table
1 of the E.I. A. format will-be required to be
filled
in
for
cases
where
major
redevelopment
of the existing
road
is
envisaged
or
a
new
road
along a different route (e.g.
bypass) is to be constructed.
The
data
to
be
collected
would
include
:
(i) Inventory data of the road— from Inventory Survey
(ii) Terrain— from tbpo sheets and site inspection
(iii) Structural condition of road and road structures—from site
investigations
See IRC
: SP
: 19 for survey procedures, data to be collected, etc.

======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 36
======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
(iv) Land-use—from Town
planning
organisations,
area/city
development authority
(v)
Traffic
—from traffic count and classification study,
speed-
delay studies, etc.
(vi) Accident —from police authorities
(vii) Environmental factors
Climatic features— from Meterological Deptt.
Wild life
—from Wildlife Deptt.
Air pollution
—see para 6.2.6.
Noise level
—see para 6.2.7.,
Others
—from site inspection
6.2.3.2.
The road should be divided into sections of similar
physical
and
environmental
features,
and
data
collected
and
presented for each section separately.
6.2.3.3.
The
purpose
of
assessment
of the environmental
quality of the existing route is for comparison with the estimated
environmental
quality after the implementation of the proposed
highway alternative.
6.2.4.
Road construction in hilly areas
6.2.4.1.
Construction of a road
in
the
hills
is
a human
necessity
for
providing
the
basic
communication
facility, but
this activity invariably disturbs the
natural
setting
and
creates
conditions conducive to large-scale
landslides
in
the
first
few
years
of
construction.
Even
dense
forests are not immune to
this problem.
With the removal of vegetative cover,
destructive
action of water
gets
further
pronounced
and
accelerates
the
process of soil erosion
and
formation
of deep
gullies.
Conse-
quently,
the
hill faces are bared of soil and vegetative cover and
enormous quantities of soil and rock move down the
rivers,
and
in some cases the road itself is washed out.
6.2.4.2.
While the adverse effects of hill road
construction
on
the
environmental/ecological
system
cannot
be eliminated
altogether, counter measures must be taken by the road constru-
ction agencies to bring down
the
adverse
effects
to
the
barest
minimum
possible.
This
calls
for
careful attention right from
the stage of conception of the road to surveys and
investigations,
alignment
selection
and
project
formulation,
construction,
and
subsequent
maintenance.
To
ensure
that
best
results
are
achieved
and
expensive
maintenance
is
avoided,
mea-
sures taken should not be considered in
isolation
but
built
into

the
road
project
itself
as
an
integral
part
with all necessary
provisions for the purpose.
Important among these are
brought
out under broad activity headings in Appendix
1.
6.2.4.3.
To ensure
that
measures
for
prevention
of
soil
erosion
and
land
degradation
are
planned and
executed in a
systematic
manner and that no important features are lost sight
of, a check list
is
suggested,
vide
Appendix 2.
Preferably
this
check
list
should
form
a
part
of
the
road
project
itself for
facilitating
cross
checking
of
the
requirements
at
different
stages.
6.2.5.
Pollution control - general
6.2.5.1.
There are about
30 major
enactments
related
to
control of pollution now being administered by the
Central and
State Govts.
The enforcement
of
the
Acts
for Prevention and
Control of Pollution of Water (1974)
and
Air (1981),
as also in
respect of Water
Cess
Act
(1977)
is
carried
out
through
the
Central Board for
Prevention
and
Control
of Water Pollution
(CBP CWP).
The Central Board also coordinates
activities
of
the 18
State
Central
Boards
statutorily
constituted
in various
States and Union Territories
for
nationwide
implementation of
pollution control.
For providing a single focus for
all
environ-
mental issues in the country and to plug loopholes in the existing
Acts, the Govt, of India
enacted
the Environment
(Protection)
Act, 1986.
This Act confers on
the
Central
Govt,
to
take
all
necessary measures for protecting the quality of environment, to
lay down standards for
discharge
of environmental
pollutants,
etc.
6.2.5.2.
Towards monitoring air
quality,
the
Ministry
of
Environment
and
Forests
have
set
up
75
ambient air quality
monitoring stations spread throughout
the
country.
Similarly,
monitoring
stations
have
been
set
up
on the river systems for
assessment of water quality.
6.2.6.
Air pollution
6.2.6.1.
Air
pollution
to
the
highway
environment
is
caused
by
road
vehicles.
For
petrol
driven
vehicles, carbon
monoxide (CO)
discharged
from
the
exhaust
of vehicles is the
pollutant.
For
diesel
driven
vehicles
it
is
the
density of the
smoke
emitted
which
though
of
not
of major importance in
respect of health
is serious from the point of view of
obstruction
to visibility, soiling of structures, public property, etc.

======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
6.2.6.2.
The
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards
have prepared
emission standards for both
petrol
and
diesel
vehicles.
These
are
:
(a)
IS
: 9057-1979,
"Emission
Limits for Carbon
Monoxide
for
Vehicles Powered
by
Spark
Ignition
Engines".
This Stan-
dard stipulates the following emission standards for CO
:
(i)
Vehicles
which
have
completed
5
years
of
life
or
80,000 km
distance,
whichever
is
earlier.
CO content
of exhaust gases by volume during idling
...Max
3 per cent
(ii)
Other vehicles.
CO content of exhaust gases by volume
during idling
...Max. 4.5 per cent
The CO
content
is
to
be
determined
as
prescribed
in
IS: 5182
(Part X)— 1977,
"Methods
for
Measurement
of
Air
Pollution
: Part X—Carbon Monoxide.
(b)
IS
: 8118-1976, "Smoke Emission Levels for Diesel Vehicles."
This
standard
prescribes
the
following
maximum
smoke
density levels
:
(i)
For
vehicles
operating
in
urban
areas,
the
smoke
density
shall
not
exceed
65
Hartridge smoke
units as
measured
by
free
acceleration method; or 5.2 Bosch or
75
Haitridge
smoke
units
as
measured
by
full
load
method.
(ii)
For
vehicles
operating
in
non-urban areas,
the smoke
density
shall
not
exceed
70 Hartridge smoke
units
as
measured by free acceleration method; or 5.5 Bosch or 80
Hartidge smoke units as measured by full load method.
The
above
standard
also
includes
the
procedure
for
measurement.
6.2.6.3.
The above mentioned vehicle emission
standards
have not yet been
made
statutory.
Also,
there
is
no national
standard for ambient air quality.
The present efforts
as regards
controlling air pollution from automobiles
have
been
restricted
to survey of the level of discharge of pollutants from the vehicles
and making suitable recommendations.
6.2.6.4.
The level of ambient air pollution because of road
vehicles depends on several factors such as the condition of
the
vehicles, the level of traffic
congestion
causing
frequent
accele-
ration/deceleration or stopping, the wind velocity and
direction,
etc.
At present, no indigenous data or models are
available for
predicting the level of ambient air pollution under
given
sets
of
conditions.
Till such time the
data/models
are
available,
it
is
suggested
that
both
the number of
motorised vehicles and the
volume/capacity
ratio
(lower
the
ratio, lesser
is the congestion
18

IRC
: 104-1988
and
lower
pollution)
be
taken
as
indicators
for air pollution
levels.
6.2.7.
Noise pollution
6.2.7.1.
Road traffic causes noise.
The noise level depends
on factors such as traffic intensity, the type and condition
of the
vehicles,
acceleration/deceleration
depending
on
the
level
of
congestion,
smoothness
of road
surface,
etc.
The BIS has re-
commended the acceptable noise levels under different situations.
The noise levels for residential areas
as
given
in
IS
: 4954-1968
are as follows
:
SI.
Location
Acceptable outdoor noise
The BIS has also brought out a number of standards on the"
measurement of noise.
These
are
:
(i)
IS
: 3028-1980,
Measurement
of Noise Emitted
by
Moving
Road Vehicles.
(ii)
IS
: 4758-1968, Method of Measurement of Noise Emitted by
Machines.
(iii) IS
: 9779—1981, Sound Level Meters.
(iv) IS
: 10399—1982, Method of
Measurement
of
Noise
Emitted
by
Stationary Road Vehicles.
(v) IS
: 10423—1982, Personal Sound Exposure Meter.
6.2 7.2.
Noise pollution
is an
irritant
and
affects human
health and efficiency.
This will therefore be required to be
con-
sidered in urban areas and other residential
areas
falling
within
100 m of the road.
6.2.7.3.
With
the
available
data,
it
is
not
possible to
predict noise levels for a given set of road and traffic conditions.

develop lower noise levels than the one otherwise.
Where higher
noise levels are experienced or anticipated,
it would be
advisable
to
provide
screen
plantations
and
other
noise
attenuating
devices.
6.2.8.
Highway aesthetics
6.2.8.1.
An aesthetically designed, constructed and
main-
tained highway
is not only
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
enhancing
the
environmental
quality
but
also
is
safe in operation
The
activity involves several steps such as choice of location, selection
of pleasing alignment which
merges
with
the
natural
environ-
ment, grassing and planting the roadside,
provision
of wayside
facilities
to travellers,
etc.
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
have
published
detailed
guidelines
on
these
aspects,
vide (i) IRC
:
SP
: 21-1979, Manual on Landscaping of Roads and
(ii) Environ-
mental Consideration
sin Planning and Design
of Highways
in
India (1979) with Discussions.
These guidelines should
invaria-
bly be consulted in the preparation of highway projects.
6.2.8.2.
Borrowing
earth
from
roadside
borrowpits
for
embankment
construction
has
been
a common practice in the
country.
Quite often the pits are
dug
in
irregular
shapes
and
left without any provision for
drainage.
This
not
only
makes
the roadside unpleasant but
also
causes
water
stagnation
with
concomitant adverse effect on
the
road
and
the
environment.
It is, therefore, necessary that the borrowpits
should
be
dug
in
regular shape and in a manner to merge these
with
the
natural
ground and provided with drainage arrangements.
6.2.9.
Pollution during construction operations
6.2.9.1.
During
road
construction
operations,
the
main
sources of pollution are
:
(i) exhaust and flue gases from the road construction equipment; and
(ii) dust resulting from construction operations.
6.2.9.2.
Most
of
the
road
construction
equipment are
governed by standards of BIS or
foreign
standards
which
pro-
vide
for
pollution
control
devices
for
the
equipment.
The
contract-conditions
should
stipulate
that
the equipment to be
used for the works should
be
provided
with
pollution
control
devices.
Also
before
start
of
construction
operations,
the
Engineer should
ensure
that
the
equipment
brought
to
work
site
are
of
standard
type
with
necessary
pollution
control
devices.

materials
like soil, sand, moorum, etc., will cause
dust
nuisance, particul-
arly when high velocity wind
is
prevailing.
In
such
cases,
it
will be advisable to slightly wet the materials at the source
itself
before loading and to cover the loaded vehicles with tarpaulin or
similar
such
material.
When
construction
activities
cause
excessive dust and noise nuisance to adjoining residential/institu-
tional areas, temporary screens may be erected.

Appendix 1
MEASURES TO PREVENT SOIL EROSION AND LAND
DEGRADATION IN ROAD DEVELOPMENT IN HILLY AREAS
1.
Project Conception and Planning
1.1.
The length of new roads to be constructed should be
bare minimum
so
that
disturbance
to
the
natural
surroundings
is
least.
A Master Plan of
entire development of hill region should be
prepared
showing
integrated
road
network
of
all
kinds
of roads to the extent possible and practicable
covering
the planning at macro and micro
levels.
It
is
necessary
that
the
main
road
should touch the cluster of villages, and separate feeder roads, bridal paths, foot
tracks, etc. , may be provided as connections.
The specification of such connec-
tions will depend upon the importance of the village.
1.2.
All road
construction
activities
should
be
coordinated
through
a
single
agency
within
the State or at Centre so that all care is exercised to have
proper planning, implementation and funding of the projects.
1.3.
All
road
projects
should
be
planned,
designed and
executed
in
accordance with the standards and specifications laid down by the Indian Roads
Congress.
2.
Alignment Selection
2.
1
.
While selecting new road alignments, attention must be paid to avoid
areas
prone to landslides, soil erosion and other damaging features.
It
should
be made obligatory to associate
geotechnical
engineers,
geologists,
forest and
soil conservation experts, economists and other specialists right from the
incep-
tion stage to ensure selection of most suitable alignment.
2.2.
Road alignments should avoid large scale
cuttings
and
fillings and
follow
the
lie of the land as far as possible.
Use of tunnels to avoid deep cuts
should be considered where feasible and economical.
2.3.
To the extent feasible, roads should be
aligned away from
streams
and
torrents
except where
these are to be crossed.
Since the greatest damage
always
occurs
along
water
courses,
special
attention
is
necessary
to
create
protection belts of forests on both sides.
2.4.
Before finalising the alignment, erosion potential of each
alternative
should be carefully examined, and the one
involving
least
disturbance
to
the
natural ground should be preferred.
3.
Design
3.1.
Where the road is in cutting, half cut and half fill type section
which
involves least disturbance to the natural ground should
be
adopted
subject
to
considerations of economy and road stability being satisfied.
3.2.
The cut slopes should be made stable for
the
type
of
strata
in
the
initial construction
stage
itself by adoption of appropriate slopes with benches,
etc., including the use of stabilising structures like breast walls, pitching, etc.
4.
Construction
4.1.
Area for clearing and^grubbing should be kept the minimum
subject
22



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 36
======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
to the technical requirements of the road.
The clearing area should be properly
demarcated to save desirable trees and shrubs and to
keep
tree
cutting
to
the
minimum.
4.2.
Where erosion
is likely to be a problem, clearing and grubbing opera-
tions should be so scheduled and performed that grading operations and perma-
nent erosion control features can follow
immediately
thereafter
if
the
project
conditions
permit;
otherwise
temporary
erosion
control
measures
should be
provided
between
successive
construction
stages.
Under
no
circumstances,
however, should very large surface area of erodible earth
material
be
exposed
at any one time by clearing and grubbing.
4.3.
The method of balanced cut and
fill formation should be adopted
to
avoid large difference in cut and
fill quantities.
4.4.
The cut slopes should be suitably protected by breast walls, provision
of
flat
stable
slopes,
construction of catchwater and intercepting drains, treat-
ment of slopes and unstable areas above
and underneath
the
road,
etc.
This
must
be
planned
in
advance
and
specific
provisions
made in the project
estimate.
4.5.
Where rock blasting is involved, controlled blasting techniques should
be adopted to avoid over-shattering of hill faces.
4.6.
Excavated material should not
be
thrown
hapazardly
but dumped
duly
dressed
up
in
a suitable form at suitable places where
it cannot get easily
washed away by rain, and such spoil deposits may be
duly
turfed
or
provided
with some vegetative cover.
5.
Drainage
5.1.
Drainage of the
water
from
hill
slopes
and
road
surface
is
very
important. All artificial drains must be linked with the existing natural drainage
system for which separate detailed engineering survey may be
carried
out and
planning
done.
Before
the
road
is
opened to
traffic, proper drainage system
including suitable interceptor and catchwater drains
must
be
completed,
This
part of the project must be given all importance as most
of
the
road damages
are caused because of negligence in providing proper drainage system and much
will be saved in subsequent road maintenance.
5.2.
The surface drains should have gentle slopes.
Where
falls
in
levels
are to be negotiated, check dams with silting basins should
be
constructed
and
that soil is not eroded and carried away by high velocity flows.
5.3.
Location and alignment of culverts should be so chosen
as
to
avoid
severe erosion at outlets and siltation at inlets.
5.4.
The cross-drainage structures should discharge
safely
on
the
valley
side,
and
in
this
connection,
all
necessary
precautions/safeguards
should be
taken to ensure that the discharging waters do not cause erosion even when they
flow for long periods.
For
this
purpose,
all
necessary
channel
training
and
erosion control
works
like
pitching/paving
of
the
channel and outfall points,
drop walls, flexible apron, etc., should be considered and provided for as a
part
of initial design and construction.
5.5.
Along with other road components, due attention should
be
paid
to
the maintenance of drainage and
soil
conservation
works.
Drains,
catchpits
23



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 36
======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
etc., should be cleared of all debris and repaired where necessary before
the on
set of the rainy season. Eioded areas should be promptly made up and provided
with vegetative cover.
6.
Grassing and Planting
6.1.
Deforestation for road construction/works should
be
bare minimum
and strict control must be exercised in
consultation
with
the
forest authorities.
Equivalent amount
of new trees must be planted as integral part of the project
within the available land and
if
necessary,
separate
additional
land may
be
acquired for this purpose.
Suitable
provisions may
be made
in
the
project
estimate.
6.2.
Depending on the availability of land and other resources,
afforesta-
tion of roadside land should be carried out to a sufficient distance on either
side
of the road.
The selection of plant species will depend on climate, altitude and
soil conditions, but preference should be given to deep rooted
trees and
plants.
For preparing the detailed scheme of afforestation, persons having knowledge of
soil conservation oi^forestory should desirably be associated.
6.3.
Vegetative cover should be established on all
cut/fill
slopes
through
any one of the techniques described
in IRC
: 56-1974 "Recommended
Practice
for
Treatment of Embankment Slopes for
Erosion
Control".
The
activity of
establishing
vegetation on barren slopes should be treated as part of the regular
maintenance operations on all hill roads.
6.4.
Strip
forests suitable for the site
conditions
for
a minimum distance
of 30 m on either side of the road boundary
should be
provided.
These
shall
be raised and maintained by forest
authorities.
No
felling
except
of dead or
dying trees should be permitted in this area.
7.
Consultations
7.1.
Local Geological Department should be consulted to
avoid
unstable
strata while fixing road alignment.
7.2.
It will be advisable, at least for important roads, to have consultation
with the officers of
the
Forest
Department
at
the
stages
of
route
alignment
selection, surveys and investigations, etc.. so as to ensure
that the selected align-
ment has minimum potential for soil erosion
and
that
the
project
designs and
estimates provide
for
the
necessary soil erosion control measures.
The idea is
that with such joint consultation pursuits practiced for some selected
roads,
the
PWD Engineers would get conversant and should be
able
to
take
care of such
requirements by themselves for other road projects in general.
7.3.
For any seriously problematic areas where normal measures
are
not
likely to be successful, specialist
organisations like the CRRI, GS1, etc., may be
consulted for evolving suitable remedial measures.
8.
Project Estimate
8.1.
The road construction project estimates should provide [for
not
only
the requisite scale of investigations but also
the
necessary measures against soil
erosion so that
these
can
be
built
into
the
project
with
adequate
financial
provision.
8.2.
For treatment of unstable areas, say 50 m above and 30 m below the
road
level,
depending on
the
site
conditions,
cost
of necessary
corrective
measures should be provided in the project estimates.
This may even be in
the
24

======================================================================
IRC
: 104-1988
form
of
certain
percentage
of
total cost but based on assessment of treatment
works possibly needed.
9.
Training
Training of road engineers in hilly areas should
be
intensive and
practice
oriented.
On every major on-going project, training facilities should be created.
The Institutes having road research facilities may be
associated
for
organising
class room and field training and solving specific problems, if any.
The training
should lay emphasis on
preservation of
ecology,
forests,
environment, etc., to
avoid denundation of fertile soibof the hill slopes and check
the
causes
leading
to landslides, etc. For efficient handling of the project, only experienced persons
with proven ability should be selected.
10.
Check List
To help the project preparing Engineer and the project approving
authori-
ties in determining whether all aspects, considerations and
items
of work
with
regard to soil conservation and erosion prevention
have
been
duly
taken
into
account, and to facilitate review at different stages, a check list is suggested, vide
Appendix 2.
The check list should form a part of the road project report.
