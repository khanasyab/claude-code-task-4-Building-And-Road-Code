GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF RIVER TRAINING AND  
CONTROL WORKS FOR ROAD BRIDGES
1. INTRODUCTION
“The Guidelines for Design and Construction of River Training and Control Works for Road Bridges” 
was first published in 1985 and a first revision was published in April 1997. The first revision 
included the floor protection works and maintenance of protective works. Two Amendments 
were issued in 2006 and 2007 and the guidelines were reprinted in 2012 incorporating these 
amendments. The guidelines needed revision to incorporate the updated research and model 
studies for design of guide bunds, slope protection, and spur. The introduction of new materials 
such as geosynthetics for slope protection and filter material also needed incorporation in 
the guidelines. Considering the requirement, the task of review and revision of IRC:89 was 
assigned by BSS Committee to B-3 Committee. A Sub-Committee comprising Shri R. Prakash, 
Convenor, Dr. Ratnakar R. Mahajan, Shri P.V. Mayur, Shri Shahrokh Bagli as Member and 
Prof. S.K. Mazumder, Shri R.G Patil as Corresponding Member was constituted to review the 
existing guidelines and suggest modifications.
The Sub-committee met a number of times and finalized the draft revision. Prof S.K. Majumdar 
and Volunteers Ms Jyoti Maan and Mr. Ishfaq Hamid contributed significantly in drafting the 
document. The draft document was considered by B-3 Committee in its meetings dated 
14.12.2018, 02.03.2019 and 26.04.2019. The draft was modified by the Sub-Committee based 
on the discussions held in B-3 Committee meetings. The B-3 Committee in its meeting dated 
11.05.2019 approved the document and authorized the Convener to edit the document and 
forward to IRC for approval of BSS and Council.

The draft was considered by the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS) in 
its meeting held on 16.07.2019 and approved the document. Subsequently, the Executive 
Committee approved the document on 8th August, 2019 for placing it before the IRC Council. 
Finally, the document was considered by the IRC Council in its meeting held on 9th & 10th August, 
2019 during the 218th Mid-term Council Meeting of IRC held at Goa and was approved for 
publication.
2. SCOPE
2.1	
The guidelines cover the layout and design of river training works and approach 
embankment protection works for ensuring safety of the bridges and their approaches. These 
guidelines also deal with some of the construction and maintenance aspects. Protection works 
for open and shallow foundations are also covered. These guidelines also cover the river training 
works for rivers in mountainous regions. 
2.2	
The scope of these guidelines is limited only to some salient aspects of design and 
construction of the protection works mentioned above and does not extend to the much wider 
associated problems of river behavior, control and bridge hydraulics, etc.
2.3	
 The necessity or otherwise of the guide bunds, spurs and other protective works must 
be decided judiciously after observing the behavior of the river at the site under consideration. 
Data about the protection works at other sites on upstream or downstream of the site under 
consideration can also be a good guide.
River training works are costly and their maintenance cost is also very high. In case, their location, 
configuration and size are not decided properly, these works can cause damaging effects also. 
Therefore, these must be provided judiciously.
The river behavior near bridges must be studied and analyzed for proper design of river training 
works. For bridges across major rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Yamuna and Ganga, the extent 
and configuration of the protective works should be decided with the help of physical models. For 
accuracy, the results obtained from physical models may be further checked on mathematical 
models preferably, by the same research station which carried out physical model studies. 
2.4	
Given inadequate knowledge of uncertainties about many aspects of bridge hydraulics 
and river behavior and characteristics in general, these guidelines cannot obviously claim to

======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
3
have any general validity of application. These are to be deemed as a guide to good practice 
of design and construction of the protection works compatible with the current experience and 
knowledge in the subject area. For particular applications, these guidelines may have to be 
modified and supplemented in each case based on subjective and objective judgement of the 
engineer, to cater for site, river and specific requirements of a bridge structure.
3. TERMINOLOGY
The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of these guidelines.
(i)	
Afflux/backwater: The rise in flood level of the river immediately on the upstream of 
the bridge as a result of obstruction to natural flow caused by the construction of the 
bridge and its approaches.
(ii)	
Alluvial streams: A stream whose bed and banks are composed of loose granular 
material, that has been deposited by the stream and can be picked up and transported 
again by the current during the floods, and is said to flow through incoherent alluvium, 
may be briefly referred to as an alluvial stream.
(iii)	
Approach road protection: Approaches are protected by means of pitching, gabions 
and turfing against ravages due to wind, rain-cuts, wave action, erosive action of 
parallel flow or frontal attack of a river. Further, where a bridge with constricted water-
way is located in a wide khadir, guide bunds alone may not afford protection to the 
entire length of approaches from the river flow. In such cases, approaches beyond the 
influence zone of guide bunds may need protection.
(iv)	
Floor protection works: Protection in the form of flooring where adoption of shallow 
foundations, becomes economical by restricting the scour.
(v)	
Guide bunds: These are embankments meant to confine and guide the river flow 
past a bridge without causing damage to it and its approaches. These are generally 
constructed in the direction of flow on one or both flanks, depending on the site 
conditions.
(vi)	
Khadir: The maximum width over which the river meanders during high floods is 
known as Khadir width of the river.
(vii)	
Meander: The curvature of flow, established in a stream either due to its own 
characteristics or due to impressed external forces.
(viii)	
River bank protection: Bank protection is afforded directly in the form of slope 
pitching, gabions and turfing or indirectly in the form of spurs.
(ix)	
Spurs or Groynes: These are structures constructed transverse to the flow of the 
river and extend from the bank into the river. These are intended to induce silting and 
diverting the flow away from the point of attack.
(x)	
Design Flood level: It is the high flood level corresponding to design flood pertaining 
to different return periods
(xi)	
Meandering river: A meander is one of a series of regular sinuous curves, bends, 
loops, turns, or windings in the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse. It 
is produced by a stream or river swinging from side to side as it flows across its 
floodplain or shifts its channel within a valley.



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019

(xii)	
Braiding river: A braiding river, or braiding channel, consists of a network of river 
channels separated by small, and often temporary, islands called braid bars Braided 
streams occur in rivers with low slope and/or large sediment load.
(xiii)	
River Morphology: The term river morphology and its synonym fluvial geomorphology 
are used to describe the shapes of river channels and how they change in shape and 
direction over time. The rivers of India reveal certain special characteristics because 
they undergo large seasonal fluctuations in flow and sediment load. The rivers are 
adjusted to an array of discharges, and most rivers exhibit morphologies that are 
related to high-magnitude floods. Major large rivers in India, namely Brahmaputra, 
Kosi, Ganga, Yamuna and Narmada, have received greater attention from fluvial 
geomorphologists. Understanding of river behavior is complicated due to integrated 
geo-morphologic, hydrologic, hydraulic and sediment parameters. It may be observed 
that the different plan forms i.e. straight, meandering, braided etc. depend on the river 
geometry, sediment load, slope and flow in the river.
4. SITE DATA
The following details are a general guideline for the data to be collected for design purpose. 
However, the nature and extent of the data to be collected would vary depending upon the 
importance of the bridge/project.
4.1	
Topographical Data
(i)	
An Index map, to a suitable small scale (topo sheets from Survey of India scale 1 
in 50,000 or 1 in 250,000 would do in most cases) showing the proposed project 
location, reach under consideration, the existing means of communication, the general 
topography of the country and important towns, any other existing or proposed structure 
across or along the river, etc., in the vicinity of the proposed works. The satellite 
imageries of 30 m resolution are apt to understand the reach under consideration. 
The satellite imagery shows the present general topography and recent changes in 
the reach of the river. A record of satellite imaginaries can be collected from National 
remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad or from any other agency.
(ii)	
River survey plans, preferably to a scale 1/10,000 for a river reach of at least two 
meander lengths upstream and one meander length downstream. In case the bridge 
is situated immediately downstream of the confluence of two rivers, the reach to be 
considered in respect of both should be at least 1.5 km upstream of the extent of back 
water influence in the tributaries under highest flood level.
(iii)	
A contoured site plan, to a suitable scale showing the location of the bridge and 
covering approaches to a sufficient distance (not less than 500 m on either side 
beyond the Khadir width in the case of a bridge across major river), the direction of 
flow, names of nearest inhabited localities, references to the bench marks used as 
datum, location of trial pits for borings and the location of nullahs, wells and outcrop of 
rocks and the existence of structures upstream and downstream of the river. The site 
plan should extend for a distance of at least 3 km upstream and 1 km downstream and 
should indicate river course during high floods and dry season duly superimposed in

extend over this area at a contour interval varying from 0.5 m in flat terrain to 2 m for 
steep terrain.
	
The nodal points which are not affected by meandering action of the river should be 
suitably marked on the plan.

 Design Data
4.6.1	
Discharge: The design discharge for which the river training works are to be designed 
shall be in accordance with the recommendations of IRC:5. 
4.6.2	
Scour depth: The mean depth of scour (dsm) below the highest flood level, shall be 
calculated in accordance with provisions of of IRC:5.

a reasonable value shall be adopted.
5. GUIDE BUNDS
The provisions given hereunder apply only to guide bunds for bridges across alluvial rivers. Guide 
bunds for bridges across sub-montane rivers need special consideration which are discussed in 
Clause 9.

5.1	
Functions of guide bunds: The guide bunds are provided to serve one or more of 
the below functions:
 
i) 
Uniform distribution of flow over the waterway of the bridge 
	
ii)	
Reduction in scour under piers and abutments
 
iii) 
Reduction in afflux
	
iv)	
Reduction in cost of bridge and approach embankments
	
v)	
Increases the safety and design life of the bridge 
 
vi) 
Guiding the flow through waterway under the bridge 
	
vii)	
Protecting the approach embankment against erosion
5.2	
General Design Features
5.2.1	
Alignment: The alignment shall be such that the pattern of flow remains as uniform 
through all the spans of the bridge as may be possible with minimum return currents.
5.2.2	
Alignment of approach embankment: The alignment of approach embankment 
should be so chosen that it is not affected by the worst possible embayment which is influenced 
by the length of guide bunds. In general, these are aligned in line with the axis of bridge up to 
high defined banks. In case the alignment of road must be given a curve before reaching the high 
defined banks, it has to be provided towards the downstream side and not towards upstream side.
5.2.3	
Classification of guide bunds: Guide bunds can be classified:
	
(i)	
According to their form in plan, and
	
(ii)	
According to their geometrical shape.
5.2.3.1	
According to form in plan: The guide bunds can be divergent, convergent, parallel and 
elliptical as shown in Fig. 5.1.
	
(i)	
Divergent guide bunds: They exercise an attracting influence on flow and they 
may be used where the river has already formed a loop and the approaching 
flow has become oblique. However, they have a tendency of shoal formation 
at center due to larger waterway between the curved heads. The approach 
embankment gets comparatively lesser protection in the case of worst possible 
embayment compared to equal bank length of parallel guide bunds, (Fig. 5.2).
therefore, require a longer length in comparison to parallel guide bunds for the 
same degree of protection to approach embankments and so, shall be used, 
only when found necessary.
	
(ii)	
Convergent guide bunds: Convergent guide bunds have disadvantage of 
excessive attack and heavy scour at the head and shoaling all along the shank, 
rendering the end bays inactive. These should be avoided as far as possible.
	
(iii)	 Parallel guide bunds: Parallel guide bunds with suitable curve heads have 
been found to give uniform flow from the head of the guide bund to the axis of 
the bridge and so these are generally preferred.
	
(iv)	 Elliptical guide bunds: These are best suited as the results obtained by using 
Guide bunds with a plan form shape in the form of a quarter of an ellipse, with the 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
8
ratio of the major axis (Length Ls) to minor axis (offset) of 2.5H :1V by allowing 
gradual constriction of flow. Thus, if the length of the guide bund measured 
perpendicularly from the approach embankment to the upstream nose of the 
guide bund is denoted as Ls, the amount of expansion of each guide bund 
(offset), measured from the abutment parallel to the approach roadway, should 
be 0.4Ls.
The Plan view orientation can be determined using the equation mentioned below, which is the 
equation of an ellipse with origin at the nose of the guide bund.
  
    
  
           
It is important that the face of the guide bund match the abutment so that the flow is not disturbed 
where the guide bund meets the abutment.

5.2.3.2	
According to geometrical shape: Guide bunds can be straight or elliptical with 
a circular or multi radii curved head as shown in Fig. 5.3. In case of acute curved channel 
approaches, it has been found that the flow after striking the mole head does not follow the 
profile of parallel guide bunds with circular heads but separates from the boundary as illustrated 
in, Fig. 5.4. It results in an oblique approach of flow to the bridge thereby making some of the 
end spans completely ineffective while increasing the intensity of flow in the remaining bays. 
To improve the flow conditions the provision of elliptical guide bunds is suggested. The ratio of 
major to minor axis is generally kept in the range of 2 to 3.5. Elliptical guide bunds have generally 
been found more suitable in case of wide flood plain/ rivers as compared to straight guide bunds.
5.2.3.3	
Any other type of guide bund differing in form or shape may be provided, warranted 
by site conditions and supported by the model studies.

5.2.4	
Length of guide bunds on upstream side
5.2.4.1	
For wide alluvial belt, the length of guide bund should be decided from two important 
considerations, namely the maximum obliquity of the current and the permissible limit to which 
the main channel of the river can be allowed to flow near the approach embankment in the event 
of river developing excessive embayment behind the guide bunds.
5.2.4.2.	
The radius of the sharpest loop should be ascertained from the data of the acute loops 
formed by the river during the past. If survey plans do not reveal the presence of a sharpest loop, 
it may be calculated as follows:
Of available loops (Fig. 5.5) calculate radius (r) of each at centre line by formula.
Fig. 5.5 Sketch showing a Loop in a River 
	
r1= (0.25 m1)2 + [0.5 (mb-b)]2/ mb-b
where	
r1 = radius of loop in metre
	
m1 = meander length in metre
	
mb = meander belt in metre
 
b = bankful width when flood level touches bank of main/deep channel in metre
From the above, calculate the average radius of the loop. This average radius divided by 2.5 
for rivers having maximum discharge up to 5000 m3/ sec and by 2.0 for maximum discharge 
above 5000 m3/sec gives radius of the sharpest loop. After having determined the radius of the 
sharpest loop, the single or double loop are laid out on survey plan that contains the alignment of 
approach embankments and high banks and it may be ensured that the safe distance between 
the anticipated sharpest loop and approach embankment is not less than L/3 where L is the 
length of the bridge. However, especially in the case of meandering rivers, this safe distance 
may be suitably increased.
5.2.4.3	
The length of parallel Guide bund on upstream side is assumed to equal to Lacey’s 
waterway
L=4.75√Q
where L is the regime waterway in meter, Q is the design discharge in m3/s.
5.2.4.4	
The length of elliptical guide bund on upstream and downstream side: Guide 
bunds should start at and be set parallel to the abutment and extend upstream from the bridge 
opening. The distance between the Guide bunds at the bridge opening should be equal to the 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
11
distance between bridge abutments. Best results are obtained by using Guide bunds with a plan 
form shape in the form of a quarter of an ellipse, with the ratio of the major axis (length L) to 
the minor axis (offset) of 2.5:1. The length of the guide bund is determined by the nomograph 
(Lagasse 1995) as shown in Fig. 5.6. The nomograph is dependent on the discharge and the 
velocity parameters. It is rational since more is the return flow more should be the guide bund 
length. For design purposes the utilization of the nomograph involves the following parameters:
Q	
-	
Total discharge of the stream, m3/s
Qf  
- 
Lateral or floodplain discharge of either floodplain intercepted by the embankment, 
m3/s
Q30m	
-	
Discharge in 30 m of stream adjacent to the abutment, m3/s
B	
-	
Length of the bridge opening, m

-

Vn2 	
=	
Q/An2 Average velocity through the bridge opening, m/s
Qf / Q30	
-	
Guide bund discharge ratio
Ls	
-	
Projected length of Guide bund, m
A detailed example is mentioned in Appendix 3 showing the procedure to determine the length 
for the elliptical Guide bunds.
Guide bunds will generally not be able to protect the approach bank within the Khadir for more 
than three times its lengths, as evolved above, beyond the abutments on the upstream side. 
Where approach banks are more than three times the length of guide bunds, additional training/ 
protective measures may be necessary to protect the approach banks.
5.2.5	
Length of guide bund on downstream side: On downstream side of the structure, the 
river tries to fan out to regain its natural width. Here the function of guide bund is to ensure that 
the river does not attack approach embankments. Length equal to 0.2 L is generally found to 
be adequate for parallel guide bunds. The length on downstream for elliptical guide bunds to be 
computed using the nomograph shown in Fig. 5.6.
5.2.6	
Curved head and tail for straight guide bunds
5.2.6.1	
Function of curved head is to guide river flow smoothly and axially through the bridge 
keeping the end spans active. A too small radius gives a kick to the river current making it 
oblique and so larger radius to attract and guide the river flow is needed. However, as it is 
uneconomical to provide a very large radius, it may be kept as small as possible consistent with 
proper functioning of guide bund.
5.2.6.2	
Radius of upstream mole head may be kept 0.4 to 0.5 times the length of the bridge 
between abutments, but it should not be less than 150 m nor more than 600 m unless indicated 
otherwise by model studies.
5.2.6.3	
Radius of curved tail may be from 0.3 to 0.5 times the radius of upstream mole head.
5.2.6.4	
Sweep angle: The angle of sweep of the upstream mole head is kept 120° to 140° 
and that for the curved tail is kept 30° to 60°.

Curved head for elliptical guide bunds: In case of elliptical guide bunds, the elliptical 
curve is provided up to the quadrant of an ellipse and is followed by multi-radii or single radius 
circular curve, Fig. 5.3. The shape should be finalized preferably based on model studies.
5.2.8	
For guide bunds of bridges across major rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Yamuna and 
Ganga hydraulic model studies are suggested for deciding the various design features.

5.3	
Design of Guide bund
5.3.1	
Top width: The top width of guide bunds for bridges across major rivers is generally 
kept at least 6 metre to permit passage of vehicles for carriage of materials.
5.3.2	
Free Board: The minimum free board to top of guide bund above the design flood 
level is generally kept as 1.8 m. This may be suitably increased in the case of guide bunds for 
bridges across major rivers. The top of guide bund should follow the slope of river flow.
5.3.2.1	
In case where model studies are conducted for guide bunds, the model studies will 
also indicate the highest anticipated design flood level immediately behind the guide bunds and 
at suitable intervals along the approaches, wherever, significant ponding up is anticipated.
5.3.2.2	
In cases where rivers have aggrading tendencies i.e. deposition of silt/sand in bed 
over the years, suitable extra provision will have to be made while working out the design flood 
level to allow for the effect of aggradation.
5.3.3	
Side slope: The side slope of the guide bunds may be determined from the 
consideration of slope stability of embankment and from hydraulic gradient considerations. 
Generally, a side slope of 2 (H): 1 (V) is adopted for predominantly cohesionless materials.
5.3.4	
Slope protection: The river side earthen slope of guide bund is protected against 
river action by covering them with stones/concrete slabs or mechanically woven double twisted 
wire mesh gabions. The pitching is intended to remain in its laid position. It should be extended 
up to the top of guide bund and tucked inside for a width of at least 0.6 m.
5.3.4.1	
 Rear slopes of guide bunds are not subjected to direct attack of the river and may be 
protected against ordinary wave splashing by 0.3 - 0.6 m thick cover of clayey or silty earth and 
turfed. Where moderate to heavy wave action is expected slope pitching should be laid up to a 
height of 1 m above the design flood level.
5.3.5	
Pitching on the river side slope: For the design of pitching on the river side, the factors 
to be taken into consideration are size/weight of the individual stone, its shape and gradation, 
thickness and slope of pitching and nonwoven geotextile filter underneath. The predominant flow 
characteristic which effects the stability of the pitching is velocity along the guide bund. Other 
factors like obliquity of flow, eddy action, waves, etc. are intermediate and may be accounted 
for by providing adequate margin of safety over the size obtain from velocity considerations. 
Pitching with mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabions or revet mattress shall be 
designed as per provisions of IRC: SP: 116.
5.3.5.1	
Size and weight of stone for pitching:
Size and weight of stones lying on side slope should be sufficient so that it does not get dislodged 
from its position due to erosive forces owing to forward flow drag as well as the component of 
its own weight trying to pull down the stone along the slope. The size of stone required on the 
sloping face of guide bunds to withstand erosive action of flow is worked out from the drag 
approach:
D = KV2

surface and V is mean velocity of flow near bank. The formula is applicable 
for normal turbulence when Kt=1
	
g

acceleration due to gravity= 9.8 m/sec2
Coefficient of drag varies mainly with shape. It is assumed as 0.5 for spherical stone for turbulent 
flow. It may be taken as 0.25 for concrete blocks with rectangular shapes 
Applying the values for various variables as Cd=0.5, Ss=2.65, k0=0.7 (for θ=26.50, and φ =430) 
and Kv=0.9 the value of K is computed as 0.026. Putting a value of K in the above formula size 
of stone if computed as 
D=0.026V2 for 2:1 & D=0.023V2 for 3:1
The weight of stone can be determined by assuming spherical stone having specific gravity 
of 2.65 (average). For velocities up to 5m/sec, the size and weight of stone is given below in 
Table 5.1.

Notes:
(i)	
No stone weighing less than 40 kg and diameter 300 mm shall, however, be used in case of loose 
isolated stones.
(ii)	
Where the required size stones are not economically available, cement concrete blocks of 
equivalent weight or stones in mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabions may be 
used in place of loose isolated stones. 
(iii) 
When stones are confined in mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabion or mattress, 
weight & size of stone should be in accordance with provision of IRC:SP:116.
5.3.5.2	
Thickness of pitching: Minimum thickness of pitching is required to withstand the 
negative head created by velocity. This may be determined by the following relationship:



======================================================================

However, thickness of stone pitching computed from the above formula shall subject to a lower 
limit of 0.3 m in case of loose isolated stones.
Thickness of pitching with mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabion or mattress 
shall be determined as per Cl. 7.2 and annexure II of IRC:SP:116.
5.3.5.3	
Shape of stones: Quarry stone is preferable to round boulders as the latter roll off 
easily. Angular stones fit into each other better and have good inter-locking characteristics. 
However, in case of gabion or mattress either rounded or angular stones can be used.
5.3.5.4	
Placing of stones: In hand placed pitching, the stone of flat stratified nature should 
be placed with the principal bedding plane normal to the slope. The pattern of laying shall be such 
that the joints are broken, and voids are minimum by packing with spalls wherever necessary 
and the top surface is as smooth as possible. Filling of gabion or mattress shall be performed 
as per procedure mentioned in IRC:SP:116. In the case of guide bunds for bridges across major 
rivers, stone masonry bands may be provided at suitable intervals if considered necessary.
5.3.6	
Filter design
5.3.6.1	
Filter shall consist of either sound gravel/stone/Jhama (overburnt) brick ballast/ coarse 
sand or nonwoven geotextiles. The non-woven geotextile, wherever used should conform to 
Cl. 4.3 of IRC:SP:116.
5.3.6.2 
Provision of a suitably designed filter is necessary under the slope pitching to prevent 
the escape of underlying embankment material through the voids of stone pitching/cement 
concrete slabs/mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabion and revetment mattress 
as well as to allow free movement of water without creating any uplift head on the pitching when 
subjected to the attack of flowing water and wave action, etc. to achieve the above requirement, 
the filter may be provided in one or more layers satisfying the following criteria:
   (      )
   (    )    
    (      )
   (    )

Notes: 
(i)	
Filter design may not be required if embankment consists of CH or CL soils with liquid limit greater 
than 30 resistants to surface erosion. In this case, if a layer of material is used as bedding for 
pitching, it shall be well graded and its D85 size shall be at least twice the maximum void size in 
pitching.
(ii)	
In the foregoing D15 means the size of that sieve which allows 15 per cent by weight of the filter 
material to pass through it and similar is the meaning of D50 and D85.
(iii) 
If more than one filter layer is required, the same requirement as above shall be followed for each 
layer. The finer filter shall be considered as base material for selection of coarser filter.
(iv) 
Where brick bats are used as filter material, normally the grading is not possible, and, in such 
cases, a layer of graded gravel shall be provided below the brick bats.
(v) 
The filter shall be compacted firmly. The thickness of filter shall be 300 mm and provided in two 
layers of 150 mm each.
(vi)	
Permittivity and maximum apparent opening size of nonwoven geotextile shall be as per Table 11 
of IRC:SP:116.
5.3.7	
Toe protection
5.3.7.1	
Launching apron shall be provided for the protection of toe and it shall form a 
continuous flexible rover over the slope of the possible scour hole in continuation of pitching up 
to the point of deepest scour. The stone in the apron shall be designed to launch along the slope 
of the scour hole to provide a strong layer that may prevent further scooping out of river bed 
material. The size and shape of apron depends upon the size of stone, thickness of launched 
apron, the depth of scour and the slope of launched apron. At the junction of slope pitching with 
launching apron, a toe wall shall be provided as shown in Fig. 5.7, so that pitching does not rest 
directly on the apron. It will protect the slope pitching from falling during the launching of apron 
even when the apron is not laid at low water level.
Fig. 5.7: Sketch showing Stone Pitching with Filter Beneath
In places where geotechnical stable bed slope is not available due to deep scour hole for placing 
the launching apron, geotextile bags or cylindrical gabions are used for filling of scour holes as 
shown in Fig. 5.8 and Fig. 5.9 [ as per IRC:SP:113 & IRC:SP:116]. These systems are dumped 
on the river bank toe to provide stable surface for placement of apron and controls the further 
erosion. The cylindrical gabions can be either filled with stones or lined with geotextile material 
filled with sand. The cylindrical gabion system works as a composite system at places where 



======================================================================

geotextile bags alone would not be able to withstand the shear stresses induced by the water 
on the system components.

Fig 5.9: Typical Cylindrical Gabion Sketch
5.3.7.2	
Size and weight of stone for apron: The size of loose stone required for launching 
apron to resist mean design velocity would be same as for slope pitching. Table 5.1 may be 
referred for size and weight of stones for launching apron, considering a slope of 2H:1V. 
5.3.7.3 
IRC:SP:116 shall be referred for specifications of mechanically woven double twisted 
wire mesh gabions or revet mattresses. 
5.3.7.4	
Depth of scour: The extent of scour depends on angle of attack, discharge intensity, 
duration of flood and silt concentration. It is important that maximum probable depth of scour 
should be assured as realistically as possible. The depth of scour for different portions of guide 
bunds may be adopted as under.

5.3.7.5	
Shape and size of launching apron: It has been observed that shallow and wide 
aprons launch evenly if the scour takes place rapidly. If the scour is gradual, the effect of width 
on launching of apron is marginal. A width of launching apron equal to 1.5 Dmax is generally found 
satisfactory (where Dmax is the maximum anticipated scour depth below bed level in metres). 
Thickness of launching apron at inner end may be kept as 1.5 t and at outer end as 2.25 t in case 
of loose stone pitching due to possible loss in stones while launching as shown in Fig. 5.10.
When mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabions or revet mattresses are used the 
thickness of launching apron may be kept same as that of thickness of pitching as per Clause 
5.3.5.2.
5.3.7.6	
Slope of launching apron: The slope of the launching apron may be taken as 2 (H): 
1 (V) for loose boulders or stones and 1.5 (H): 1 (V) for cement concrete blocks or stones in 
mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabions.

An apron may fail to provide protection to the guide bund if the river bed contains high percentage 
of silt or clay or where the angle of repose of the bed material is steeper than that of stone as in 
such a case the apron may not launch properly.

Certain types of kankar blocks develop cementing action under water and such types 
of kankar blocks may be used with caution.

Constructional Aspects
5.4.1	
Co-ordination is necessary for tagging together guide bunds of road and rail bridges 
on the same river or streams where located in close vicinity of each other is likely to be influencing 
one or the other and for the same appropriate combined, if necessary, hydraulic model studies 
for both should be carried out to evolve properly tagging design.
5.4.2	
Trial pits should be taken in borrow area to examine suitability of soil for construction 
and to decide the type of earth moving machinery to be arranged.
5.4.3	
Guide bunds may be made of locally available materials from the river bed preferably 
cohesionless materials. Low density cohesionless soils (loamy soils) are susceptible to 
liquefaction and should be avoided.
5.4.4	
Every effort should be made to complete the work of guide bund in one working 
season.
5.4.5	
For the construction of embankments for guide bunds provisions of IRC: 36 shall 
be followed unless otherwise stated in these guidelines. For high embankments provisions of 
IRC:75 may be followed.
5.4.6	
Dispatch of stone: Transport of stone from the quarries to the river bank and from 
the river bank to the site of work is an important task. The quantities of stone required to be 



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
20
transported every day must be worked out and trains/ trucks, etc., arranged accordingly. Similarly, 
prior arrangements may be made for taking the stones across the river by ferry or boats.
5.4.7	
Earthwork
5.4.7.1	
For construction of guide bunds, four operations are involved:
	
(i)	
excavation of the pit for the apron
	
(ii)	
completion of the earth work for guide bunds
	
(iii)	 construction of approach banks
	
(iv)	 laying stones in apron and on slopes
5.4.7.2	
It is necessary that sufficient length of pit along the guide bund should be ready within 
one or two months of commencement of work so that placing of stones in the apron and on slope 
can be started at the earliest. About 70 per cent working season should be available for pitching. 
Earthwork should be completed within 80 per cent of working season. Good compaction of guide 
bunds is necessary as any slip during the flood can be disastrous. No portion of the guide bund 
should be left below HFL before the onset of monsoon. Bottom of apron pit should be excavated 
to a minimum depth up to thickness of apron.
5.4.7.3	
Sufficient labour and/or earth moving machinery of the right type with spare parts and 
trained staff is necessary.
5.4.7.4	
Borrow pits: No borrow pits should be dug on the rear of guide bunds. It is preferable 
to take all earth for construction of the guide bunds from the river side. The borrow pits should be 
away from the edge of launching apron at least 0.5 times of width of launching apron ensuring 
geotechnical stability is not compromised. 
5.4.8	
Adequate labour for unloading of pitching stone, carrying and laying it at site within 
the time available will have to be carefully worked out.
5.4.9	
Construction of guide bunds should be taken in hand along with piers and abutments. 
Where there is any doubt about completion of whole guide bund within one working season, it is 
essential that the construction of guide bund be started from abutment towards upstream. Where 
full guide bund cannot be constructed in one working season suitable protective measures may 
be taken.
5.4.10	
On slopes, care should be taken in placing the stone not to have big voids through 
which water will cause swirling. Comparatively smaller stones should be at the bottom and larger 
ones at the top.
5.4.11	
The top of the guide bunds should be protected with a layer of 150 mm thick gravel 
against rain cuts.
5.4.12	
While on river side, stone protection is provided up to the full length of guide bunds, 
on the rear side this protection is just carried around mole head beyond which usually good 
turfing is provided.
5.4.13	
Closure of branch channels of a river: In case the alignment of guide bund or the 
approach embankment crosses a branch channel of the river, the usual practice under such 
circumstances is either to divert the branch channel to the main channel of the river with the 
help of spurs, etc., or to construct closing dyke or closure bund across the branch channel. In 



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
21
situations where diversion of channel is to be resorted to, then action in this regard should be 
taken during the receding floods and in advance of the construction of guide bund/ embankment. 
In situations where closing of the branch channel is considered unavoidable, then the closure 
bund closing dyke or the armoring of the approach embankment should be properly designed 
and closing operation should be carried out as a continuous one. While using the mechanically 
woven double twisted wire mesh gabions or mattress for pitching in slope and apron, the 
construction sequences shall be followed as detailed in the IRC: SP:116.
6. SPURS
6.1	
Functions of Spurs and their Classifications
6.1.1	
Function of spurs
Spurs are provided to take care of one or more of the following functions:
 
(i) 
Training the river along a desired course by attracting, deflecting or repelling 
the flow of a channel.
 
(ii) 
Creating a slack flow with the object of silting up the area in the vicinity.
 
(iii) Protecting the river bank by keeping the flow away from it.
	
(iv)	 Contracting a wide river channel, usually for the improvement of depth for 
navigation.
6.1.2	
Classification of spurs: Spurs can be classified as follows:
 
(i) 
Classification according to method and materials of construction: Permeable 
and impermeable (solid).
 
(ii) 
Classification according to the height of spur with respect to water level: 
Submersible or non-submersible.
 
(iii) Classification according to the function served: Attracting, deflecting, 
repelling and sedimenting, Fig. 6.1.
	
(iv)	 Special type-T-headed, Hockey or Burma type and kinked type stepped 
type, etc., Fig. 6.1.
6.1.2.1	
Permeable spurs: Permeable spurs obstruct flow and slacken it to cause 
deposition of sediment carried by the streams. These are, therefore, best suited for sediment 
carrying streams and are also preferable in hilly regions. Generally used permeable types of 
spurs are pile, tree or porcupine.
In comparatively clear rivers their action results in damping erosive effect of the current 
and thus prevents local bank erosion. The percentage permeability is defined as area 
of openings of the gross area normal to flow and should not be less than 35% and more 
than 45%.
6.1.2.2	
Impermeable spurs: Impermeable spurs consist of rockfill or earth core armored 
with resistant material like stone mattress and stones in gabion or revet mattress or concrete 
blocks. They are designed to attract, repel or deflect the flow away from the bank along a 
desired course.

 Fig. 6.1 Types of Spurs or Gyrones
6.1.2.3	
Submersible spur: A submersible spur is the one whose top level is above the normal 
water level in the river but gets submerged during the highest design floods.
6.1.2.4	
Non-submersible spur: This is the type of spur which remains above water even 
under the highest floods.
6.1.2.5	
Attracting spur: These are the spurs which attract flow towards the bank and are 
aligned in a direction pointing downstream. In a river where there is a heavy attack on one bank, 
it may be desirable to construct the attracting spurs on the opposite bank in conjunction with a 
repelling spur on the affected bank.
6.1.2.6	
Repelling spur: A spur pointing upstream has the property of repelling the river flow 
away from it and hence it is termed as repelling spur.
6.1.2.7	
Deflecting spur: Where the spur, usually of short length changes only the direction 
of flow without repelling it, is known as a deflecting spur and gives only local protection.
6.1.2.8	
Sedimenting spur: The spurs located at right angles to the river flow fall under this 
category.
6.1.2.9	
Special type spur: These spurs have been named after their builders and have 
special design features like Denhey’s T Headed, Hockey or Burma type and kinked type, etc. A 
spur with a curved head is known as a Hockey or Burma type spur whereas a spur with a short 
straight head normal to spur direction is known as a Denhey’s T Headed spur and a spur with a 
slight angular head is known as a kinked type spur.
6.1.2.10	
Over the past years as per construction feasibilities and ease below spurs as shown 
in Table 6.1 are also designed.

6.2	
General Features
6.2.1	
Location and length:
6.2.1.1	
Location: Spurs/groynes placed on the outside of a bend usually begin at the 
start of the curve and continue to one spur spacing beyond the end of the curve as shown in 
Fig. 6.2. One extra spur is placed beyond the downstream end of the curve as it is needed 
to define the straight after the bend (otherwise the flowing water tends to erode the bank 
after the last spur).
Fig. 6.2 Placement of Spur/Groyne along the bank of river
6.2.1.2	
Length: When the bank is irregular, spur length should be adjusted to provide 
even curvature of the thawleg. The length of the impermeable spurs is generally considered 
from 15% to maximum 20% of the width of the channel while for permeable spurs it is 
considered between 20%- 25% of the width of the channel. The model studies suggest that 
if the gyrone length is equivalent to 1/5 of the river width it had given a better protection 
length along the river bank.
6.2.2	
Orientation: The spurs/groynes oriented slightly upstream is the best option as it 
traps more sediment upstream and downstream of spur than those perpendicular to the flow 
direction. It also repels flow away from the bank. The spur inclined upstream is generally 20-30 
degrees upstream from line normal to flow direction as shown in Fig. 6.3.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
29
Fig. 6.3 Orientation of spurs/Groyne upstream
6.2.3	
Spacing: In a straight reach the spacing is about three times the length of spur. 
Spurs are spaced further apart (with respect to their length) in a wide river than a narrow one, 
if their discharge are nearly equal. In a curved reach a spacing of 2 to 3.5 times the length of 
spur is recommended. Larger spacing (3 to 3.5 times) can be adopted for concave banks and 
smaller spacing (2 to 3 times) can be adopted for convex banks. Sometimes the spurs are 
spaced further apart from consideration of cost or for enabling construction of more spur at the 
later date. An alternative graphical method based on the geometry of the river is proposed and 
explained below. The spacing of a pair of spurs depends on the length of the upstream spur, 
the orientation of the spur and the location of the bank. The water flowing past the head of the 
spur deflects back to the bank by an angle ‘Beta’ of 9 to 14 degrees. Thus, the calculation of the 
second spur position is based on a line 0 to 14 degrees off the line tangential to the revised edge 
of channel line as shown on Diagram 6.4 below. The spacing between the spurs at the nose is 
expressed in equation below.
S=L cot Ø
Where	
S = spacing between spurs/groyne at the nose
	
L = effective length of spur/groyne or distance between arcs describing toe of spurs 
and desired bank line
	
Ø = expansion angle downstream of spur nose, degrees

6.3	
Design of Impermeable Spurs/Groynes
6.3.1	
Top width: The top width of embankment spurs should be 3 m to 6 m at the formation 
level. However, in many cases the top width will be dictated by the width of any earth moving 
equipment used to construct the spur.
6.3.2	
Free board: The minimum free board above the design flood level on upstream of 
spur is generally kept as 1.8m.
6.3.3	
Side slopes: For cohesionless soil, slope on upstream and downstream face of 
2(H):1(V) may be adequate. For spur constructed wholly in stones or mechanically woven double 
twisted wire mesh gabions or mattress, steeper slopes may be adopted.
6.3.4	
Size and weight of stone for pitching: same as guide bund (as per clause 5.3.5.1).
6.3.5	
Thickness of pitching: same as guide bund (as per clause 5.3.5.2).
The thickness ‘t’ of the pitching should be provided in one third of total length or for such a length 
of upstream shank up to which the river action prevails (whichever is more) at the semi-circular 
nose. In the next one third of the total length of the spur the thickness of pitching may be reduced 
to 2/3 t on upstream and rest of the shank length 0.3 m thick stone pitching may be provided. On 
the downstream of stone pitching may be reduced 2/3 t in last one third length of the spur and 
rest of the shank length a nominal stone pitching or turfing may be provided.
6.3.6	
Filter: Sound gravel/ stone/ jhama (overburnt) brick ballast/ coarse sand or nonwoven 
geotextile is provided as a filter media below the pitching at nose and on the upstream face for 
one third of the length of spur. After two third of the length of spur, the upstream shank the filter 
may be eliminated.
6.3.7	
Launching apron
6.3.7.1	
Size and weight of stone: Same as for guide bunds (see para 5.3.7.2 & 5.3.7.3).
6.3.7.2	
The depth of scour for different portions of spur can be adopted as given in Table 6.2 
and shown Fig. 6.5.

Fig. 6.5. Plan showing depth of Scour of Spurs/Groynes
6.3.7.2	
Shape and size of launching apron: A width of launching apron equal to 1.5 Dmax 
(where Dmax is the maximum anticipated scour depth below low water level in metres) should 
be provided at semi-circular nose and should continue up to one third length of the spur on the 
upstream or for such a length of upstream shank up to which the river action prevails (whichever 
is more). In the next one third length of the spur on the upstream the width of launching apron 
may be reduced to 1.0 Dmax. In the remaining reach, nominal apron or no apron may be provided 
depending upon the flow conditions.
The width of the launching apron on the downstream should be reduced from 1.5 d max to 
1.0dmax in next one third length of the spur and should continue in last one third length of the 
spur. If the return flow prevails beyond the above specified reaches, the apron length may be 
increased to cover the region of return flow. Thickness of launching apron may be kept as 1.5 t. 
A typical design of spur is illustrated in Fig. 6.6.
When mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabions or revet mattresses are used the 
width of launching apron is to be followed as above. However, the thickness of launching apron 
may be kept same as that of thickness of pitching.

Alternatively, spurs can also be designed with the help of polar diagrams discussed 
in para 8.
6.4	
Permeable Spurs
6.4.1	
Tree spurs: The objects of the tree spurs are to:
 
(i) 
Divert or deflect the current which is directly threatening erosion of a bund;
 
(ii) 
Deaden the flow in one channel of the river near the bund to open out another 
channel away from the bund; and
 
(iii) Silt up a channel of the river at its source by checking the flow in it.
6.4.1.1	
Initially, the tree spurs should be laid pointing upstream at an angle between 60° 
to 70° so that when the spur launches and becomes sand bound, it assumes a position 
facing slightly upstream. Unlike an impermeable spur, which is generally made to face 60° 
upstream, a permeable spur should make a larger angle with the bank upstream, since it 
would collect floating debris against the face, converting it to an almost impermeable one with 
attendant disadvantages. Care should be taken that after launching, it is not bodily shifted 
to assume a position of an attracting spur, which would induce accretion only downstream 
of it.
6.4.1.2	
Tree spurs consist of a thick wire rope firmly tied at one end to the bank and tied 
at the other end to a heavy concrete block. Leafy trees with large branches are suspended 
from the wire rope. Alternatively, the tree spurs are also constructed as detailed below:

IRC:89-2019

Fig. 6.7 Tree Spurs (Para 6.4.2.2)
Vertical stakes are driven 1.5 to 2.5 m into the river bed at 3 m intervals along the cross section 
of river (see Fig. 6.7). Each row of such stakes are placed about 9 m apart. These stakes 
are held in position by diagonal stays and guy ropes secured to strong pegs well embedded 
in* the firm banks. The verticals (stakes) are connected to each other by transverse pieces 
having holes drilled in them to take the tapered end of intermediate verticals of 75. to 100 
mm dia, placed in between the main verticals at 0.3 m centres. The entire structure is made 
watertight by lining the vertical stakes on their upstream side by bundles of local grass and 
the space between two such rows of spurs is thickly filled with trees. Holes are drilled 0.3 m 
up their stem through which a ring is fitted. The trees are held in position by a wire rope 2.5 
cm dia. attached to the rings, the wire rope being firmly anchored to the bank.
6.4.2	
Pile spurs: Spurs of this type can be constructed out of bamboo, timber, sheet 
piles or even R.C.C. piles. In pile spurs (Fig. 6.7 to Fig. 6.11) the piles constitute the main 
verticals: they are driven down 6 to 9 m inside the river bed, 2.4 to 3.0 m apart and in at 
least 2 similar rows. The rows of verticals are not more than 1.2 to 1.8 m apart. Between 
the main verticals, there can be two intermediates, embedded at least 1.2 m below the bed. 
Each row is either closely inter-twined with brush wood branches, going in and out around 
each vertical or horizontal railings. The upstream row is braced back to the downstream row 
by trans verses and diagonals. Every other main vertical of the rear row has to be strutted. 
The strut being embedded a minimum of 2.4 m below bed. Between the two rows, the space 
is filled with brush-wood branches, closely packed and tamped. The filling may comprise 
alternate layers of 1.8 m thick brush wood weighted down by 0.6 m thick stones and sand 
bags. However, debris collects upstream and the spur becomes sand bound and functions 
subsequently, like and impermeable spur. To guard against scour occurring under such 
conditions, it is desirable to protect the bed, both up-stream and downstream of the spur 
and around the nose with a stone apron, 0.9 m thick, 3 m wide along the shank and 6 m 
wide around nose.

7. RIVER BANK PROTECTION
Normally river bank protection is the prime responsibility of flood control authorities. However, for 
protection of a road embankment running along a river course or for protection of bridge abutment 
close to the river edge, bank protection measures are sometimes required to be adopted.
7.1	
Causes of Bank Failure
For the purpose of design of bank protection, the causes of bank failure have first to be identified 
as listed below:
	
(i)	
Washing away of soil particles from the bank by a strong current.
	
(ii)	
Undermining the toe of the bank by eddies, currents, etc., followed by a collapse 
of overhanging material deprived of support.
 
(iii) Sloughing of slope when saturated with water by floods of long duration.
	
(iv)	 Piping in sublayers due to movement of ground water towards the river which 
carries away material with it.
	
(v)	
Due to secondary current developed at outer bank.
7.2	
Type of Protection Work
7.2.1	
Direct method: Flood embankments and banks can be protected by means of loose 
stone pitching, concrete blocks or stone filled gabion or mattress revetment with as per Clause 
5.3.5, 5.3.6 and 5.3.7

Indirect method: Spurs, porcupines, bed bars and studs/ dampeners and cut offs.
7.2.2.1	
Spurs: These have been discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
7.2.2.2	
Porcupines: These are permeable spurs which help to induce siltation along the 
banks. These are made of steel, bamboo or timber and are provided on a scouring bank in a 
line normal to the flow. These spurs increase the roughness of the channel thereby deflecting 
the eroding current away from the bank. In course of time, vegetation grows within the jacks and 
action of spur is enhanced further.
One type of porcupine, known as Kellner Jack comprises three steel angles about 5 m long 
bolted together at the centre with the wire string between the legs. A typical unit of porcupine 
looking from the bank is shown in Fig. 7.3 (a).

Other type of porcupine used for similar purpose is made of bamboo. These are made of 3 to 
6 m long bamboo of 75 mm diameter tied together at the centre in the form of a space angle and 
are weighed down by tying boulder stones packed in wire cage at the centre. A typical bamboo 
type porcupine spur is shown in Fig. 7.3 (b). RCC porcupines are used commonly on sites as 
shown in Fig. 7.3 (c/d)

7.2.2.3	
Bed Bars: Bed bars are submerged structures which help to divide the flow 
horizontally. 
Row above the top of the bed bars can be compared to flow over the submerged weir while flow 
below the top level of the bar is obstructed by it and is directed towards the nose as in the case of 
a full height spur. When the alignment of a bed bar is skewed, a pressure gradient is set up. The 
bed bars can be placed either facing towards upstream of the direction of flow or facing towards 
downstream of the flow direction.
When the bed bar is facing towards upstream of the flow, the pressure gradient developed helps 
to deposit sediment on the upstream side of the bar and thus is useful for bank protection. This 
is shown in Fig. 7.4(a).
When the bed bar is facing towards downstream of the flow, the pressure gradient directs the 
bottom current away from the bank while surface flow is directed towards the bank. This is 
provided upstream of an offtake point for sediment exclusion and is shown in Fig. 7.4(b).

Studs: These are short spurs provided between the regular long spurs to provide 
local protection to the river bank. Thus, the studs are useful device of bank protection 
where embayments occur between the T-head spurs. A typical design of stud is given in 
Fig. 7.5.
7.2.2.5	
Submerged vanes which neutralizes the anticlockwise vortex by superimposition 
of clockwise vortex developed by the vanes. Vane-induced secondary current eliminates the 
naturally occurring secondary current and stabilizes the bank.

7.2.2.6	
Cut-offs
Meandering river tends to shift laterally (Fig. 7.6) on the outer bank side (concave side) with 
time due to secondary current which scour away material on the outer side of meandering bend 
and deposits the same on the inner (convex side) side of the bend. In this process, curvature 
of flow goes on increasing with time and the bend becomes sharper Secondary current in the 
bend becomes stronger. As a result, there is more scour and greater lateral shifting. The process 
continues till there is a formation of natural cut-off and formation ox-boe type lake. There is a lot of 
head losses in the consecutive sharp bends of a typical meandering river resulting in afflux and rise 
in High Flood Level (HFL). Sharp bends deteriorate the navigability of the river. Cut-offs – natural 
or artificial - help in straightening a river, fall in HFL and improvement in navigability of the river
Fig. 7.6 Lateral Migration of a Meander and Stream Cross Sections in a Bend
7.3	
Before undertaking the work of permanent river bank protection, some sort of 
temporary protection work must be done near the abutments of the bridges located on the 
downstream. Only after observing the behavior of the river for sometimes permanent river bank 
protection works should be taken up.
7.4	
Design of Bank Protection
7.4.1	
Grading: Trees, brushwood, grass, etc., must be removed both above and below 
the water level for clearing the bank. The cleared bank slope has then to be graded so that it is 
flatter or at least equal to the angle of repose of the soil under water to prevent sloughing. The 
landside slope of the pitched bank made in the form of an embankment should be flat enough to 



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
43
be stable. The top width of the embankment may be at least 1.5 m.
7.4.2	
Free board: A minimum free board of 1.0 m above HFL is generally provided.
7.4.3	
Pitching: Same as for guide bunds (refer clause 5.3.5)
7.4.4	
Filter Material: Same as for guide bunds (refer clause 5.3.6)
7.4.5	
Apron: As the attracting influence of the pitched bank depends on the extent to which 
scour occurs at its toe, the revetment must be provided with elaborate toe protection in the 
form of launching apron. The apron must be designed for the maximum depth of scour likely to 
occur. Generally, the maximum anticipated depth of scour is assumed to be 1.5 dsm in a straight 
reach and at a moderate bend where dsm is the mean depth of scour measured below highest 
flood level to be calculated as per IRC:5. In the case of bank at severe bend, it is assumed as 
1.75 dsm and in the case of bank at right angled bend, it is assumed as 2 dsm. The design of 
launching apron should be made in the same way as for guide bunds (see para 5.3.7.1.).
8. APPROACH ROAD PROTECTION
8.1	
Different Categories of Approaches to Bridges - Protection Thereof
Nature of protection to be provided for approach embankment of highway bridges depends upon 
its location which can be divided into the following broad categories:
(i) 
Approach embankments subjected to flooding but where the velocity of flow is 
insignificant (not exceeding 1 m/sec.) to cause erosion.
(ii) 
Approach embankments which are under direct and frontal attack of the river flow or 
otherwise subjected to velocity of flow exceeding 1 m/sec.
(iii)	
Approaches to bridges located in the beds of meandering rivers with large Khadir 
width requiring guide bands, etc. 
8.2	
Approach Embankments subjected to Flooding but where the Velocity of Flow 
is Insignificant (not exceeding 1 m/sec.) to Cause Erosion
8.2.1 
These cases occur where the river flows through flat terrain with large spills. In such 
cases, bridges must be provided with adequate waterway to allow for quick and easy flow of 
the flood water to prevent undue afflux and consequent submergence of valuable agricultural 
and other lands. Further where the bed material is scourable, flooring with curtain walls is often 
provided. In case spill-through type abutments are provided in conjunction with the flooring, the 
sloping embankments in front of the abutments, often extending into the river causing some 
obstruction in the flow, need to be adequately protected against the erosive attack of the flow 
across the embankment.
8.2.1.1	
Apart from the above, cases may also arise wherein spill- through type abutments may 
be adopted from economic consideration for bridges with open foundations in non-scourable or 
rocky bed. In such cases also, the approaches will need to be adequately protected. In either 
case, the treatment should be on the lines discussed in para 8.2.2

Fig. 8.1 Typical Sections of Stone Slope Protection
8.2.2 
For a particular bank slope and velocity of flow, the thickness of the slope pitching, 
size of the stone, its gradation and filter design should be worked out in accordance with the 
recommendations made in para 5.3. However, the designed values arrived at should not fall 
below those indicated in Figs. 8.1(A) or 8.1(B).
8.2.2.1	
The slope pitching should terminate either in a short apron at the bed level as indicated 
in Fig. 8.1(A) or the pitched slope anchored in the flooring/rock as shown in Fig. 8.1 (B). However, 
along the length of the approach, the bank protection should begin and end at a stable section 
on the approach subject to a minimum of 15 m. In cases where the river banks must be protected 
they should also be protected in a similar manner and if such stable sections are not available, 
suitable terminal treatment of pitching should be provided at the ends as shown in Fig. 8.2.

Fig. 8.2 Details of cut-off at terminals of rip-rap blanket (Para 8.2.2.1)
8.2.3	
For the embankment where velocity of the flow is not exceeding 1m/s, Geomats may 
also be used to control the surface erosion. Geomats are made of synthetic material filaments, 
tangled together to form a highly deformable layer 10-20 mm thick, featured by a very high 
porosity (greater than 90% on average).
8.3	
Approach Embankments which are under Direct and Frontal attack of the River or 
otherwise subjected to velocity of flow exceeding 1 m/sec.
8.3.1	
These cases occur where the flow is confined within banks during ordinary floods 
but spills during high floods without meandering. In such cases, waterways provided are often 
less than the bank to bank width of the river, which is very wide during high floods and the 
approaches to the bridges protrude into the river tending to act like spurs. There will be parallel 
flow with increase in velocity along the embankment. The distance of the embankment so affected 
depends directly upon the percentage of constriction adopted and the angle of crossing. Large 
constrictions will not only result in excessive cost of protection consequent to deepening of bed 
but would also entail deeper foundation of bridges, as well as change in channel profile both 
upstream and downstream. The final decision as to the percentage of constriction to be adopted 
should be such that the cost of the bridge plus the protection to be provided is the minimum. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
46
various parameters that affect the design of protective works of the approaches are as under:
	
(i)	
Intensity of discharge,
	
(ii)	
Angle of crossing
 
(iii) Velocity of flow
 
(iv) Scour pattern around the approaches; and
 
(v) 
Soil in the embankment fill.
8.3.2	
Under the above conditions, the approach embankment protruding into the river is 
under the direct attack of the river flow and this needs to be protected like a spur. It is seen 
that the scour reduces as one moves along the spur towards the bank for which the extent of 
protection could be curtailed towards the bank. The polar diagrams given in Fig. 8.3 show the 
centre line of spur as base and the ratio of deepest scour depth to mean depth of scour as 
ordinates. These ratios can be made use of to ascertain the maximum scour depth once the 
mean depth of scour is known. Thereafter, once the points of deepest scour are known, the 
apron widths for the approach embankments can be designed in accordance with the provisions 
contained in para 5.3.
Fig. 8.3 Polar diagrams of different inclination of a straight spur showing type and extent of 
projection (Para 8.3.2)
8.3.3	
Another aspect is the length along the approach embankments which needs to be 
protected. The length on the upstream and downstream side of the spurs needing protection 
bears a linear relationship with the angle of spur as shown in Fig. 8.4. On the analogy of 
the approach embankments acting as short spurs, the upstream and downstream lengths 
needing protection may be divided into two categories as shown in Fig. 8.3 viz., category ‘X’ 



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
47
extending from the bank to the point of mean depth of scour and category ‘Y’ extending from 
the point of mean depth of scour to the point of deepest scour towards the deep channel. 
The portion covered under category ‘Y’ could be assessed based on the corresponding 
values of the lengths of spurs requiring to be protected, i.e., ‘Lx’ given as fraction of total 
length ‘L1’ of approach embankment projecting into the river and obtained by taking the 
angle of spur to the direction of flow and reading the values from Fig. 8.4. The length of 
the approach Lx - L1 gives the length of the approach under category ‘X’. Design of the 
slope pitching, filter backing and apron under category ‘X’ and category ‘Y’ could be made 
on basis of recommendations given in para 5.3. The apron width for category ‘X’ may be 
designed as a normal one and its width reduced uniformly from that required the end of 
category ‘Y’ to 2.5m (minimum)
Fig. 8.4 Length requiring protection as a function of spur inclination (para 8.3.3.)
8.4	
Approaches to Bridges located in the Beds of Meandering Rivers with large Khadir 
width requiring Guide bunds, etc.
8.4.1	
These cases pertain to rivers which meander in the alluvial plains and have 
large Khadir widths even under ordinary flood conditions. From economic considerations, 
it is, however, imperative to provide waterways much less than the width between ends 
of the Khadir of the river. This is achieved with the help of guide bunds, the treatment 
of which has been discussed in para 5, which restrict the river to flow within an artificial 
gorge. The section of the approach embankment beyond the Khadir portion is subjected 
to flooding but there is no significant flow to cause scour due to parallel flow or draw down 
conditions and balancing of water on both sides of the embankment. For these conditions 
to be satisfied, however, the alignment of the approach embankment and its distance from 
the worst possible embankment loop should be fixed as indicated in paras 5.2.1.1 and 
5.2.3.1 respectively.
8.4.2	
In view of still water conditions, nominal slope pitching, mechanically woven double 
twisted wire mesh gabions and revetment mattresses e.g., 0.3 m thick may be provided for 
embankment height up to 7.5 m increased to 0.5 m in the lower portion where its height 
exceeds 7.5 m. The minimum weight of stones used shall be 40 kg.



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
48
8.4.3 
The design of filter backing is dependent on the voids in the stone pitching and the 
gradation of bank material. For the nominal nature of pitching suggested in the preceding 
sub-para, geotextile needs to be provided as a filter media.
8.4.4	
The slope pitching should extend well above the pond level considering the 
exigencies of abnormal floods and wave action. The free board in any case, should not be 
less than 1.2 m. A higher free board would be advisable in case of aggrading rivers.
8.4.5	
The pitched slopes should be provided with nominal toe for velocity less than 
1m/s. In case toe walls are not provided a nominal apron of at least 2.50 m width and 0.80 
m thickness should be provided at bed level. No protection of downstream slope is ordinarily 
necessary and provision of turfing/erosion control blanket of synthetic/natural material etc. 
may suffice.
In case other types of pitching and filter materials as well as toe protection measures are 
required to be adopted as per site conditions, a suitable design as recommended in para 
5.3 may be adopted.
8.4.6	
For construction of approach embankments within the khadir area, no borrow pits 
shall be permitted within the area bounded by the guide bund on one side, natural bank 
on the other side and the lines drawn tangentially to the top of upstream and downstream 
curved heads parallel to approach embankment. Moreover, the edge of the nearest borrow 
pits shall be not less than 200 metre from the toe of the embankment both on the upstream 
and downstream side in any case.
8.4.7	
As far as possible, no opening should be provided in the bridge approaches falling 
in the khadir portion of the river. However, if these are unavoidable, only floored structures 
should be provided with revetment in immediate approaches on either side of the structure. 
These structures should be provided with sluice gates which should be kept closed during 
flood season.
8.4.8	
Where the approach embankment in the Khadir terminates in a marginal bund or 
at any protective embankment/afflux bund constructed by irrigation/flood control department, 
the adequacy of the latter within the zone of influence of embankment should be checked 
and if need be, the same should be got suitably raised/strengthened in that stretch.
8.5	
Special Consideration
The aforesaid guidelines do not cover the provision where the approach embankments are 
under the attack of sea waves or tidal bores, etc. In such cases, the protective measures 
may be evolved based on expert literature/ model experiments. Stability of embankments 
to be protected should be ensured based on local experience and/or slope stability analysis 
related to appropriate soil data.
9. DESIGN OF RIVER TRAINING AND CONTROL WORKS IN  
SUB-MONTANE REGIONS
9.1	
The rivers in sub-montane regions do not present a regular pattern of meanders 
as in the case of alluvial rivers in plains. The bed slopes of the rivers in the hilly regions 
are very steep which create tremendous velocities and bed materials being unable to 



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
49
withstand such velocities are scoured and transported down the river. They carry very 
heavy charge of coarse sand, shingle and boulders, which are accentuated by large slips 
and landslides that take place in the hill slopes and result in heaps of deposits on flatter 
slopes. In the North-Eastern part of this country, it is further aggravated by the seismic 
character of the Himalayan zone. Due to seismic disturbances the friable rock loosens and 
landslides occur and the sediment load of the Himalayan rivers increases substantially. 
The channels become shallow and owing to the reduced velocity, obstructions in the 
form of heaps result in diversion of the channel itself. As the river bed upstream through 
the bridge itself rises, the flood cannot pass through the bridge quickly and it heads up-
above the bridge submerging low lying areas. The bed level of the river upstream of 
the bridge thus rises progressively with consequent rise in the flood levels resulting in 
increase in flooding of areas upstream of the bridge. The protection works for submontane 
regions merit special consideration besides the points already covered in earlier paras. 
It is, therefore, necessary that protection works for bridges in sub-montane regions are 
decided judiciously by the Engineer-in-charge keeping in view the site conditions and 
other relevant factors.
9.2	
Most of the rivers in sub-montane terrain are subject to the phenomenon of 
rolling boulders during high floods. Huge boulders hitting the piers and abutments may 
cause enormous damage. In such cases, heavy protection around piers/abutments may 
be necessary which may be in the form of stone facing mechanically woven double twisted 
stronger wire mesh gabion or steel plate lining. The same may be decided by the Engineer-
in-charge keeping in view the site conditions. In case heavy floating debris is anticipated, 
necessary traps may be provided to prevent the same from reaching the structure.
9.3	
Permeable spurs and toe walls with launching apron may also be, considered for 
protection works.
9.4 
The flow control in steep sloping rivers is provided by use of check dams. A 
series of check dams create backwater by flattening the river slopes and reducing the 
velocities.
Fig. 9.1. Typical Example of Check Dams

10. FLOOR PROTECTION
10.1	
For bridges where adoption of shallow foundations becomes economical by restricting 
the scour, floor protection to bridges must be provided. The floor protection will comprise of rigid 
flooring with curtain walls and flexible apron to check scour, washing away or disturbance by 
piping action, etc. Usually performance of similar existing works is the best guide for finalizing 
the design of new works. 
10.2	
Suggested Specifications
10.2.1	
Excavation for laying foundation and protection works shall be carried out as per 
specifications under proper supervision. Before laying the foundation and protection works the 
excavated trench shall be thoroughly inspected by the Engineer-in-charge to ensure that:
 
(i) 
There are no loose pockets, unfilled depressions left in the trench.
	
(ii)	
The soil at the founding level is properly compacted to true lines and level.
	
(iii)	 All concrete and other elements are laid in dry bed.
10.2.2	
Rigid flooring: The rigid flooring shall be provided under the bridge and it shall 
extend for a distance of at least 3 m on upstream side and 6 m on downstream side of the bridge. 
However, in case the splayed wing walls of the structure are likely to be longer, the flooring shall 
extend up to the line connecting the end of wing walls on either side of the bridge.
10.2.2.1 The top of flooring shall be kept 300 mm below the lowest bed level.
10.2.2.2 Flooring shall consist of 150 mm thick flat stone or bricks on edge, with cement 
mortar 1:3 laid over 300 mm thick cement concrete M-30 grade laid over a layer of 150 mm 
thick cement concrete M-15 grade. Joints at suitable spacings (say 20 m) may be provided.
10.2.3	
Curtain walls: The rigid flooring shall be enclosed by curtain walls (tied to the 
wing walls) with a minimum depth below floor level of 1.27 times of depth of scour on 
upstream side and 1.27 times the depth of scour + 0.5 m on downstream side. The curtain 
wall shall be in cement concrete M-30 grade/brick/stone masonry in cement mortar 1:3. The 
curtain off wall can be attached with raft slab and should not be less than 300 mm thick with 
M 30 grade concrete. It should be designed as normally reinforced PCC wall with 0.12% 
steel of Fe 500 grade in each direction on both faces, with clear cover of 75 mm. These 
walls should not have structural continuity or moment connection with RCC slab, but the 
joint should be leak tight. The cutoff wall should be taken at lease 300 mm below the mean 
depth of scour calculated as per IRC:5. However, the total minimum depth below floor shall 
not be less than 2 m on upstream side and 2.5 m on the downstream side below the top 
of the floor. In case the substratum with continuous layer of stiff non-securable clay in the 
neighborhood of downstream of cut-offs a judicious adjustment in the depth of upstream 
and downstream cut-offs shall be made to avoid building up pressure under the raft (refer 
clause 15.1.1 of IS:6966).
10.2.4	
Flexible apron
10.2.4.1 The thickness of flexible apron shall be 0.6 m for Manning’s velocity up to 3 m/s 
at raft top and for velocity more than 3 m/s the same shall be 1.0 m comprising loose stone 
boulders (weighing not less than 40 Kg). Flexible apron shall be provided beyond the curtain 



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
51
walls for a minimum distance of 3 m on upstream side and 5 m on downstream side. Where 
required size stones are not economically available, cement concrete blocks or stones in 
mechanically woven double twisted wire mesh gabion or mattress with rockfill properties as 
per Table 6 of IRC:SP:116 shall be used in place of isolated stones.
10.2.5 
Wherever scour is restricted by provision of flooring/flexible apron, the work of 
flooring/apron etc., should be simultaneously completed along with the work on foundations 
so that the foundation work completed and left to itself is not endangered.
10.2.6	
One dimensional mathematical model like water routing and backwater models to 
solve problems such as dam break, flood wave transmission, effect of bridge constriction etc. 
were commonly in use before the introduction of computers. Now with the easy access to 
mainframe computer and personal computers with large memories, it has become possible 
to develop software and study the morphological changes of short and long duration by 
simulation models. Institutes such as Central Water Commission, Central Water and Power 
Research Station, Pune, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, and some of the State 
Irrigation Research Institutes and Indian Institute of Technology at Delhi, Bombay etc. have 
developed suitable software to study these aspects in river engineering.
11. PHYSICAL MODEL STUDIES
11.1	
Objects of Model Studies
The river has its own characteristics depending on its size, flow of water and sediment, the terrain 
through which it flows and the nature of the bed and banks. Hence, each case is to be considered 
individually for its training. Despite our efforts to improve the design of training measures, we are 
still to go a long way before understanding the river mechanics and its behaviour. Till then one 
has to cater for unknown parameters with a factor of safety. It is here that model studies offer a 
handy tool at supplementing the work of designer by providing an insight into conditions likely to 
obtain in the prototype.
11.2	
Situations Warranting Model Studies
11.2.1 
River flow being a very complex phenomenon, eludes easy analysis in many cases. 
This is more so near the bridges, barrages and other hydraulic structures built on the alluvial 
rivers where normal river waterway is often constricted for economy. In some cases where the 
structures are not located on the straight reaches or where it is required to study the effects of 
other structures viz., an existing bridge, a weir, a new dam or flood embankments or Ghats along 
the river, it is not possible to visualize the river behavior accurately in respect of flow pattern, 
velocity distribution, etc., after the construction of the structure. In all such cases, model studies 
will be helpful in understanding river response to these structures.
11.2.2	
In cases where the cost of a new bridge/barrage project or additional river training 
works for existing bridge/barrage is substantial, model studies are advisable. Cost of model 
studies in such cases is a very insignificant percentage of the total cost of the project. It has the 
added advantage of suggesting improvements which may sometimes lead to reduction in the 
cost of the project.

11.5	
Model Limitations
11.5.1	
While some type of problems can be solved with the aid of model studies with a high 
degree of accuracy, certain aspects of studies connected with the rivers flowing in alluvium 
present difficulties. In the mobile bed river models, the results lack scalar transformation to the

55
prototype. They cannot, therefore, be applied quantitatively but can be regarded as qualitative. 
Some of these aspects are described in Appendix-2. Suitable model techniques have been 
devised to reduce the gap between model results and natural occurrence showing what may 
be reasonably expected from the model results and what should not be expected. Models are 
always helpful in that, they make it easier to visualize the problems and evaluate the relative 
effects of different treatments making allowance for model limitations, but the success depends 
primarily on correct diagnosis and evaluation of all factors causing change. Moreover, model 
scale is to be often distorted since flow depth in a homogeneous scale model may be so low 
that the flow may be laminar and there is surface tension effect. A physical model of river is 
made on Freudian law. In such a situation, model Reynolds number of flow is considerably less 
than that in prototype. Modeler has to ensure that the model flow is at least turbulent. Even then 
the prototype Reynolds number is far more than that in the model. Under such a situation, the 
prototype turbulence/eddies is much higher than that in prototype. Therefore, scour and similar 
phenomena in prototype can not be quantified. However, qualitative results can be predicted.
11.5.2 
In the final analysis, the validity of results of model study and interpretation of its 
results depends on experience, sound judgement and reasoning of the modeller.
12. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
12.1	
General
One dimensional mathematical model like water routing and backwater models to solve problems 
such as dam break, flood wave transmission, effect of bridge constriction etc. were commonly in 
use before the introduction of computers. Now with the easy access to mainframe computer and 
personal computers with large memories, it has become possible to develop software and study 
the morphological changes of short and long duration by simulation models. Institutes such as 
Central Water Commission, Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune, National Institute 
of Hydrology, Roorkee, and some of the State Irrigation Research Institutes and Indian Institute 
of Technology at Delhi, Bombay etc. have developed suitable software to study these aspects in 
river engineering.
12.2	
Mathematical Model Techniques
Commonly used techniques in mathematical modelling are given below:
12.2.1	
Water Routing
Water routing provides temporal and spatial variations of the stage, discharge, energy gradient 
and other hydraulic parameters in the channel. The “water routing component has the following 
major features:
(a) 
Numerical solution of the continuity and momentum equations for longitudinal flow,
(b) 
Evaluation of flow resistance due to longitudinal and transverse flows, and
(c)	
Upstream and downstream boundary conditions.



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
56
(d)	
The continuity and momentum equations in the longitudinal direction are derived as 
follows:
  
      
       
…1
 
 
  
       
    
 
      
  
     (  
  )     

…2
Where	
Q	 = 	
discharge
	
A = 
Cross sectional area of flow
	
t	 =	
time
	
x	 = 	
longitudinal direction along the discharge center line measured from the 
upstream entrance.
	
q = 
lateral inflow rate per unit length
	
H	 =	
stage of water surface elevation
	
g	 =	
acceleration due to gravity
The upstream boundary condition for water routing is the inflow hydrograph and the downstream 
condition is the stage discharge relation.
The longitudinal energy gradient can be evaluated using any valid flow resistance relationship. 
If Manning’s formula is employed, the roughness coefficient V must be selected according to the 
bed diameter and river conditions.
12.2.2	
Sediment Routing
The sediment routing component has following major features:
(a)	
Computation of sediment transport capacity using a suitable formula for the physical 
conditions.
(b)	
Determination of actual sediment discharge by making corrections for availability, 
sorting and diffusion.
(c) 
Upstream/conditions for sediment inflow.
(d)	
Numerical solution of the continuity equation for sediment.
(e)	
These features are evaluated at each time step and results so obtained are used in 
determining the changes in channel configuration. To treat at the time dependent and 
non-equilibrium sediment transport the bed material at each section is divided into 
several size fractions and sediment transport is computed using suitable formula.
The equation of continuity for sediment in the longitudinal direction is given by:
(   )   
       
         

…



======================================================================

IRC:89-2019
57
Where,	
λ	 =	
porosity of the bed material
	
Qs	=	
bed material discharge
	
qs = 
lateral inflow rate of sediment per unit length
According to this equation, the time change of cross-sectional area is related to the longitudinal 
gradient in sediment discharge and lateral sediment inflow. In the absence of lateral sediment 
inflow, longitudinal imbalance in Q, is absorbed by channel adjustments towards establishing 
uniformity in Q.
The change in cross sectional area for each section at each time step is obtained through 
numerical solution of Equation 3. This area change will be applied to the bed and banks following 
correction techniques for channel width and channel bed profile.
13. INSPECTION
13.1	
Purpose
The successful functioning of any river training and protective work depends on its proper design, 
construction and maintenance. After completion of river training and protective works, a close 
watch must be kept on their performance so that timely action, wherever necessary, can be 
taken to avoid major damages and difficulties later.
13.2	
Frequency and scope
The protective works like guide bunds spurs, pitching around abutments, etc., shall be inspected 
about a month before the flood season during the floods and immediately after the floods.
The inspection before the floods shall be carried out to ensure that all flood protection measures 
have been carried out as per design in case of new works. In case of existing works, it will be 
ensured that these are intact and in position as per design and drawings.
Inspection during the floods shall be carried out to have information about HFL obtained, ` 
of bed, and launching of apron etc., to take corrective measures as soon as required. The 
inspecting officer must look for aspects like launching of the apron, settling of the slopes, piping 
action, improper drainage of the rain water causing the slope to be disturbed, impact of waves, 
carrying away of the smaller particles and thus disturbing the slope, any undue scour at the 
nose of the bund and/ or at the toe of the pitching and give his recommendations to ensure 
that the protective works function adequately. The quantity of reserve stones available at site 
for meeting emergent situations shall be checked before floods against specified quantity and 
duly reported.
The floor protection shall also be inspected before, during and after the floods to ascertain the 
extent of scour, cracking and damage of the floor, if any and adequacy of the cut off walls and 
apron, etc. Specific recommendations for augmentation of the existing provisions, if any, shall 
also be given.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
58
13.3	
Points to be Kept in View
(a) 
Most careful patrolling and watch is necessary during each flood season especially 
the first flood season to detect any weakness in construction and to take corrective 
action promptly.
(b)	
The Engineer-in-charge should acquaint himself with the past history of the protective 
works and the behavior of the river as it is only when he possesses all this knowledge 
that he can deal effectively with any problem that may arise.
(c)	
It is advisable to have a reserve quantity of stone which can be used in case of an 
emergency. A part of the stone may be stacked on the guide bund itself and a part 
in the nearest store from where it can be loaded and transported quickly to site. The 
quantity of reserve boulders would depend upon site conditions. However, 2 per cent 
of the total quantity of boulders used in apron and slope pitching may be kept as 
reserve in stock for emergent use.
(d) 
It is necessary that during the flood season the field Engineers ‘ remain vigilant and 
keep a careful watch on the behavior of the river as it affects the training works. 
During flood season it is advisable to have regular patrolling of the guide bund and the 
approach banks and proper action taken when any abnormal swirls, eddies or scour 
are apprehended. Any small rain cuts or displacement by waves along the guide bund 
or the approach bank must be repaired immediately as there is always the danger of 
a small cut developing into a major disaster, if not, attended to.
(e)	
Any settlement in the bank or bridge or slip in the slope needs immediate attention.
(f)	
During winter or dry weather, survey of the river course must be carried out to a 
distance of 2 meanders (or 1 km whichever is more) upstream and 1 meander 
downstream for meandering rivers and 5 L (or 1 km whichever is more) upstream and 
3 L downstream for non-meandering rivers.
(g)	
Soundings preferably with the help of an echo sounder shall be taken near the guide 
bund when the river is in flood.
14. MAINTENANCE ASPECTS OF RIVER TRAINING AND PROTECTIVE WORKS
14.1	
 Proper maintenance of river training and protective works is extremely important as 
damages to them can be more dangerous than damages to bridges where no protective works 
are provided. It is, therefore, important that maintenance Engineers are made aware of the 
design principles underlying the various provisions made in different protective works as well as 
likely causes and nature of damages so that their significance is very well understood, and the 
maintenance is carried out effectively. They should also acquaint themselves with the history of 
the bridges, their protective works and behavior of the river as only when they possess all this 
knowledge that they can deal effectively with any maintenance problem.
Keeping the above in view the list of important records which should be available at site for 
proper maintenance has been drawn. But this list is by no means exhaustive and other records 
as necessary in each individual case should also be kept at site.



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 92

IRC:89-2019
59
(i)	
Longitudinal section, cross section and plan indicating the course of the channel.
(ii)	
Plan showing location of bridge.
(iii)	
Salient design details of bridge and protective works.
(iv) 
Plan indicating layout and dimensions of the embankment slope pitching, filter layers, 
cut off walls turfing launching apron, drains etc. and details of materials used in the 
construction grading, Liquid Limit, Plasticity Index Proctor Density and Optimum 
Moisture Content.
(v) 
Record of observed High Flood Level, discharge, velocity of flow, obliquity of flow, 
functioning of the bridge and protective works including changes in the flow pattern. 
For important bridge gauge stations should be established to measure the discharge.
(vi)	
Record of River Survey details up to a distance of 5 times the length of the bridge 
(or 1 km whichever is more) on upstream side and for a distance equal to 3 times 
the length of the bridge on downstream side along with cross sections at suitable 
intervals for the last ten years.
(vii)	
Record by way of photographic evidence of the nature and extent of damages 
observed in the past and the remedial measures undertaken.
(viii)	
Copy of the model study report if model tests were got carried out for location of 
bridge protective work.
(ix) 
A record of satellite imagery for important bridges updated every five years through 
National Remote Sensing agency. In case any abnormal situation is observed then 
additional satellite imageries even at lesser intervals should be taken and record 
maintained.
14.2	
 The Maintenance Work can be classified under two Categories:
	
(i)	
Pre-monsoon Maintenance Work
	
(ii)	
Monsoon Maintenance Work
(i)	
Pre-Monsoon Maintenance Work
	
(a)	
Repairing or reconditioning the existing protective works to the original design 
section in advance so that these can withstand the pressure of the ensuing 
flood.
	
(b)	
Ensuring adequate free board to cater for any unexpected settlement with the 
aggradation of the river bed by wave action or occurrence of flood of higher 
intensity than the designed one, without any adverse effect on the performance 
of bridge and protective works.
	
(c)	
Filling up all hollows and depressions in the embankment of the guide bunds 
wherever existing and ramming earth after clearing the site of all loose and 
vegetal materials.
	
(d)	
Providing a cover of soil containing 10 per cent to 15 per cent of clay well rammed 
and rolled where the filled top material is sandy or silty.
	
(e)	
Rodents and other animals make holes, cavities and tunnels through and under 
the embankment of the guide bunds. These are sources of danger causing 



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
60
excessive seepage which may give rise to serious breaches during flood period. 
Such holes should be carefully located, examined and provided with inverted 
filter, filled with earth and rammed. Alternatively, such holes can be filled with 
well rammed stiff clay.
	
(f)	
Planting of trees on the top of guide bunds should not be permitted because 
their roots tend to loosen the core of the guide bunds. Deep rooted bushy shrubs 
or short grass or both growing on the slopes of embankments is good protection 
against erosion and wave wash. Generally, the slopes should be turfed with 
grass sods. 
	
(g)	
Examining necessity of Protective measures by revetment/rip-rap, launching 
apron, floor protection, etc., and carrying out the same before onset of monsoon, 
for bridge foundations, approach embankments and guide bunds which are in 
imminent danger of erosion.
 
(h) 
Top of guide bund wherever those are designed to carry vehicular traffic should 
be kept in good condition so that they effectively serve the purpose of transport 
of materials and inspection both during the monsoon and pre- monsoon periods.
	
(i)	
All Departmental vehicles, boats and launches should be kept operational. All 
tools and plants including torch lights hurricane lamps and spades, etc., and 
firefighting articles as well as materials for erecting temporary sheds at the work 
sites for workers should be arranged and stored in a suitable place.
	
(j)	
Advance collection of sand bags, stone boulders (about 2 per cent of total 
quantity used in apron) and GI wire for making wire crates, for use in the event 
of emergency.
	
(k)	
To take soundings near the bridge and protective works particularly at locations 
where the river is showing a tendency to meander to compare actual observed 
scour near bridge foundations and protective works with designed scour.
	
(l)	
Proper communication system should be installed for quick transmission of 
messages to higher authorities.
(ii)	
Monsoon Maintenance Work
	
(a)	
During Monsoon very careful maintenance of the Protective Works is required as 
the flood water of river threatens safety of the guide bunds, spurs and approach 
embankments. It assumes further importance in case of new guide bunds. The 
establishment required to be engaged for proper maintenance will depend upon 
the importance and behavior of the river. As soon as the water touches the guide 
bunds and shows further rising trend in its level, a control room should be set 
up and round the clock patrolling should start. This should continue until water 
recedes the Low Water Level. During this period inspection by senior official 
should also be carried out.
	
(b)	
 Special vigilance is necessary towards the country side of the guide bund to 
detect any formation of boils due to seepage which call for immediate attention.
	
(c)	
In the event of abnormal rise in water level threatening the washing away of the 
guide bund, the level of the top of the guide bund may be suitably raised. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
61
common method of building up the height is by providing dowel on the river side 
of the top of the guide bunds with bags filled with earth. These bags should be 
half full only so that these will fit closely against each other. Sand should not be 
used for filling the sacks, if clay or loamy soil is available.
 
(d) 
During floods scour depth should be measured daily and in case it exceeds 
designed scour depth dumping of boulders in the scour hole should be resorted 
to with large size boulders as well as boulders in wire mesh gabion.
 
(e) 
In case of displacement of slope pitching/filter media the same should be 
immediately restored wherever necessary with sand bags/stone boulders/stone 
in wire mesh gabion/ cement concrete blocks/multicellular geocomposite flood 
containment unit as per IRC:SP:113.
 
(f) 
After the flood season when the water level has fallen, cross-sections should 
be taken at every 50 m interval along the length of the guide bund or spurs 
by probing wherever necessary to ascertain the position of the stone in the 
slope and the apron. The cross-sections will indicate the progress in launching 
of the apron, its ultimate position and reveal any defect that may require remedy. 
The cross-sections taken after each flood season should be compared with 
the original cross-sections, to examine the variations, if any. The damages to 
protection work should be restored to its original position by dumping further 
quantity of loose stone of required size or boulders in wire mesh gabion wherever 
necessary. Damaged wire mesh gabion should be replaced.
 
(g) 
Model tests and field observations have confirmed that for satisfactory launching 
of apron the bed materials should scour easily and evenly. If an apron is laid on 
the riverbed consisting of alternate layers of sand and clay, the sand layers scour 
and clayey layers subside causing uneven cliffs as a result the apron cannot 
launch uniformly. Stones fall in the river bed and are washed away by the water 
current. Therefore, clayey beds cannot be used as dependable foundations 
for aprons. In places where clayey beds are unavoidable sufficient quantity of 
reserve stone at hand should be kept to fill the uneven depressions and scour 
holes as well as to repair the other damages.
 
(h) 
The launching apron if damaged should be repaired by diverting the flow, if 
necessary. During such repairs the portion launched should not be disturbed 
and new crated sausage work should be provided over it.
	
(i)	
In the case of major damages like slope failure or major changes in river 
behavior it may be necessary to close the bridge to traffic pending restoration 
on immediate basis which should be based on re-assessment of the damages 
noticed, design parameters past and present.
	
(j)	
In the case of bridges and protective works which are in imminent danger every 
year, permanent remedial measures should be finalized only on the basis of 
model.

Formula for computation of afflux
Afflux is approximately calculated using below formulae:
1.	
Molesworth formula given below for streams with non-erodible beds
	
h1*=[(v2/17.88) + 0.015]* [(A/A1)2-1]
	
where
	
h1* = Afflux in metre
	
v = Average velocity of river prior to obstruction in metre/sec
	
A= unobstructed section area of river in sq. metre
	
A1= Sectional area of river at obstruction in sq. metre
2.	
Bradely formula for shallow channels with wide flood plains
	
h1*=3*(1-M)*Vn
2/2g
	
M = Qb/Q, where Qb is that portion of the total discharge Q in the approach channel 
within a width equal to the projected length of the bridge and Vn2 = Q/An
2 and An
2 is 
the gross area of waterway under the bridge opening below normal stream depth 
corresponding to design flood discharge
Example: Computation of afflux at a bridge location for river Yamuna where the hydraulic details 
are as given below
Design flood discharge -11,000 m3/sec
Design HFL-216.50 m
Lowest bed level in main channel -208 m
Lowest bed level in Flood plain-212 m
Width of main channel-600 m
Flood plain width: Left-600 m, Right-1200 m
Depth of flow in main channel= 216.50-208=8.5 m
Area of flow in main channel (Am) = 600X8.5=5100 m2
Area of flow in under bridge (A1) = 600X8.5=5100 m2
Depth of flow in flood plain = yf =216.50-212=4.5 m
Area of flow in flood plain (Af) = (600+1200)X4.5=8100 m2
Total area of flow upstream of bridge =A=Am +Af =5100+8100=13200 m2
Average velocity of flow upstream of bridge =V=Q/A=11000/13200=0.83 m/s
 
a) 
Afflux as per Molesworth formula
	
	
h1*=[(v2/17.88) + 0.015]* [(A/A1)2-1] = [(0.83^2)/17.88)+0.015]*[(13200/5100)^2-
1]=0.306 m
 
b) 
Afflux as per Bradely formula
	
	
h1*=3(1-M)*Vn
2/2g
 
 
M=5100/13200=0.386; Vn=Q/A1 = 11000/5100 = 2.156
	
	
h1*=3*(1-0.386)*[(2.156^2)/(2*9.8)]=0.436 m
 
Since the bridge is located on wide flood plain Bradley formula is applicable.

2.	
EXPRESSION FOR COMPUTATION OF BACKWATER (AFFLUX)
A practical expression for backwater has been formulated by applying the principle of conservation 
of energy between the point of maximum backwater upstream from the bridge Section 1 and a 
point downstream from the bridge at which normal stage has been re-established in Section 4 
(Figs. 1 A and 2 A). The expression is reasonably valid if the channel in the vicinity of the bridge 
is essentially straight, the cross-sectional area of the stream is fairly uniform, the gradient of 
the bottom is approximately constant between sections 1 and 4, the flow is free to contract and 
expand, there is no appreciable scour of the bed in the constriction and the flow is in the sub-
critical range.
The expression for computation of backwater h1 upstream from a bridge constricting the flow, 
formulated based on model studies is as follows:
       
   
 
     ⌈(   
  
)
 
  (   
  
)
 
⌉    
  
   

……… (1)
To compute backwater, it is necessary to obtain the approximate value of h*t by using the first 
part of expression (1)
  
         
 
   

……. (1.1)
The value of in the second part of the expression (1) which depends on h1 can then be determined 
and the second terms of expression (1) evaluated.
3.	
BACKWATER COEFFICIENT
3.1 
The value of the overall backwater coefficient K* is dependent on the following:
(i)	
The bridge opening ratio M, i.e., the degree of stream constriction involved, expressed 
as the ratio of the flow which can pass unimpeded through the bridge constriction to 
the total flow of the river and type of bridge abutments.
(ii)	
 Number, size, shape and orientation of piers in the constriction.
(iii)	
Electricity or asymmetric position of bridge with respect to the valley cross section 
and,
(iv)	
Skew (bridge crosses stream at other than 90o angles).
Base coefficient Kb: Kb is a backwater coefficient for a bridge in which only the bridge opening 
ratio M is considered. Knowing the type of abutments, shape of wing walls and the value of M 
use Fig. 3 for estimating Kb.

Effect of piers (normal crossing)
The introduction of piers in the bridge causes constrictions and consequential backwater. This 
incremental backwater coefficient is designated as ∆Kp which can be obtained from Fig. 4 by 
entering chart-A with the proper value of J and reading upwards the proper pier type, ∆K is read 
from the ordinate. Obtain the correction factor σ from chart-B Fig. 4 for opening ratios (M) other 
than unity. The incremental backwater coefficient is then 
∆Kp = σ ∆ K
3.4	
Effect of piers (Skewed crossings)
In the case of skewed crossings, the effect of pier is calculated as for normal crossings except the 
computation of J, An2 and M. The pier area for a skewed crossing Ap is the sum of the individual 
pier areas normal to the general direction of flow as illustrated in Fig. 4 An2 for a skewed crossing 
is based on the projected length of bridge b cos Φ and also include the area occupied by the pier. 
The value of J is the pier area. Ap divided by projected gross area of the bridge constriction, both 
measured normal to general direction of flow. The computation of M for skewed crossing is also 
based on the projected length of bridge.

Effect of Eccentricity
The magnitude of the incremental backwater coefficient ∆Ke accounting for the effect of 
eccentricity can be calculated from Fig. 5 Eccentricity is defined as 1 minus the ratio of the lesser 
to the greater discharge outside the projected length to the bridge.

afflux coefficient will be somewhat larger than for comparable value of M shown on the base 
curve).
3.6	
Effect of Skew
The method of computation of incremental of backwater coefficient ∆K5 for the skewed crossing 
differ from that of normal crossing in the following respects: 
The bridge opening ratio M is computed of the projected length of bridge rather than on the length 
along the center line. The length is obtained by projecting the bridge opening upstream parallel 
to the general direction of flood flow as it existed before the placement of the embankments in 
the stream. The length of constricted opening is bs cos Φ and the area An2 is based on the length. 
The velocity head v2/2g to be substituted in expression (1) is based on the projected area An2

KINETIC ENERGY COEFFICIENT
A weighted average value of the kinetic energy is obtained by multiplying the average velocity

∑(   )
     
A second coefficient α2 is required to correct the velocity head for non-uniform velocity distribution 
under the bridge.

MODEL LIMITATIONS
In the mobile bed river model, the results lack scalar transformation to prototype. They cannot 
be applied quantitatively, however, they can be considered as qualitative. Some of these are:
1.1	
Exaggerated Scour Holes
Silting in model is much slower than in the prototype while the scouring takes place during the 
early stages of the hydrograph in model. Firstly, this suggested scour hole is due to dissimilar 
horizontal and vertical scales, scour holes tend to be proportional to vertical scale while the width 
tends to be proportional to horizontal scale. Secondly, in falling stages of the hydrograph bed 
movement in model is negligible, as such the scour hole which used to be filled up in prototype 
does not fill up in model. However, the scour depth obtained gives an idea of the formation and 
direction of new channels and is helpful for design of launching apron.
1.2	
Non-reproduction of Silting in Model
In prototype, most of the sediment moves in suspension and very little as bed load. Silting is 
mostly due to suspended sediment, while in model, bed load is much higher than the suspended. 
Moreover, due to limited length and duration of run of model the suspended sediment does not 
settle down. The silting is only indicated by the slack flow or return flow of low intensities.
1.3	
Incorrect Throw Off
Throw off in distorted model is different from the corresponding throw off in the prototype. This 
is partly due to the increased height in comparison to width of the structure, and partly due to 
very steep side slopes. Some of the research institutes have constructed Ml width as well as 
part width river models to reproduce approximately similar effects. First full width river model is 
constructed to small scales, the entry conditions in part width model are adjusted to reproduce 
the lines of flow observed from full width model. The throw off in part width model obtained is 
reproduced in full width model. The process is repeated till approximate similarity is obtained.
1.4	
Incorrect Meandering
Due to uncertainty of uniform bed movement, further development of meanders in case of 
meandering rivers, is not correctly reproduced in the distorted models, It is due to this reason that 
correct development of new channels, re-survival of old channels and further silting of islands is 
seldom depicted from these models.
1.5	
Longitudinal Distortion
In vertically exaggerated models for bridges and barrages the thickness of the piers is much less 
and the width to depth ratio of model span and prototype span is not same. As such sometimes 
either number of piers are reduced to maintain the above ratio, or a few piers are combined to

======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
76
form one pier, the shape of such piers differs from that in prototype and effects the coefficient 
due to changed shape.
1.6	
Different Time Scale
To reproduce correct silting in model, the hydrograph in the model should be run for a longer 
time. This time is defined as hydraulic time and the time scale for hydraulic time is:
	
(T2)r = Lr hr(-05)
When the sediment movement is guided by tractive force and the sedimenting time scale could 
be obtained by tractive force method, this works out to (T2)r = hr
1.5. The only solution to this is 
that hr should be equal to Lr
0.5 which results in higher exaggerations so more departure from 
prototype. Generally, time scale adopted is hydraulic time. In the above formulae (T1)r and (T2)r 
are the time scales, Lr is the length scale and hf is the height scale of the model.

(Para 5.2.4.4)
DESIGN OF GUIDE BUND LENGTH
1.	
Introduction
The length of Guide bunds shall be decided based on the flood values in the construction area. 
The length of the guide bund is determined by the nomograph (Lagasse 19951) as shown in the 
Fig. 2. The nomograph is dependent on the discharge and the velocity parameters. It is rational 
since more is the return flow more should be the guide bund length. For design purposes the 
utilization of the nomograph involves the following parameters:
Q	
- Total discharge of the stream, m3/s
Qf 
- Lateral or floodplain discharge of either floodplain intercepted by the embankment, 
m3/s
Q30m	
- Discharge in 30 m of stream adjacent to the abutment, m3/s
b	
- Length of the bridge opening, m
An2 
- Cross-sectional flow area at the bridge opening at normal stage, m2
Vn2	
- Q/An2 Average velocity through the bridge opening, m/s
Qf/Q30	
- Guide bund discharge ratio
Ls	
- Projected length of Guide bund, m
2.	
Working example
Problem statement: It is proposed to design Guide bunds on an alluvial river with the following 
data as shown in Fig. 1
Design flood discharge -11,000 m3/sec
Design HFL-216.50 m 
Lowest bed level in main channel -208 m
Lowest bed level in Flood plain-212 m
Width of main channel-600 m
Flood plain width: Left-600 m, Right-1200 m
Estimated discharge distribution: Main channel-6800 m3/sec, left bank-1400 m3/sec, right bank-
2800 m3/sec.
Solution:
1.	
Computation of left bank discharge 
As per Lagasse:
	
Computation of left Guide bund length
 
Flood discharge in left flood plain Qf = 1400 m3/sec
	
Q30 =discharge in 30 m length adjacent to pier = (total discharge/total width)*30 m



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:89-2019
78
	
Q30 = (11000/600)*30=550 m3/sec
	
  
   
     
        
	
Vn2 = Mean velocity of flow under the bridge 
	
Vn2 =Q/A2= (total discharge/(width of channel*water depth under channel)
	
Vn2 = 11000/ (600*8.5) =2.15 m/sec
Referring the nomograph and entering the values of Qf/Q30=2.5 and Vn2 =2.15 in Fig. 2 left Guide 
bund length=50 m.
Fig. 1: Cross Section of River Section
2.	
Computation of right Guide bund length
 
Flood discharge in right flood plain Qf = 2800 m3/sec
	
Q30 = 550 m3/sec
	
Qf/Q30 = 2800/550=5.09
	
Vn2 = 2.15 m/sec
Referring the nomograph and entering the values of   
   
       and Vn2=2.15 in Fig. 2
Therefore, Right Guide bund length=80 m.
