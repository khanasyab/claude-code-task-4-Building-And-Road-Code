GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF
PRECAST PRE-TENSIONED GIRDERS FOR BRIDGES
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Reinforced, Prestressed and Composite
Concrete Committee (B-6) of the Indian Roads
Congress was reconstituted in 2003
.
1.2
In its first meeting held on 29* April, 2003,
the
Committee
felt
that
in
the
light
of
the
massive construction programme that was under
execution
in
the
highway
sector,
it
was
necessary to bring out guidelines on certain topics
which were not adequately covered in the existing
IRC
Codes
and
Standards.
The
design
and
construction of precast pretensioned girders for
bridges was one of the topics
selected.
It was
decided
that
while
highlighting
the
special
detailing
requirements,
the
guidelines
would
generally be
in line with IRC: 1 8 and IRC:2 1 and
IS: 14268 with additional inputs from BS:5400,
EURO and AASHTO Codes besides guidelines
from
British
Cement
Association,
Portland
Cement Association and
Precast
/
Prestressed
Concrete Institute where necessary.
1.3
The
initial
draft
of
the
guidelines
was
prepared by Shri Jose Kurian and revised by Shri
Vinay Gupta. The draft alongwith inputs received
from Shri A.B. Saha and Shri S.A. Reddi was
discussed and finalized in its meeting held on
1 6*
and 17* September, 2005. The B-6 Committee
comprised ofthe following personnel

1 .4 The draft document was approved by Bridges
Specifications and Standards Committee
in
its
meeting held on 22"'' October, 2005. The dou ment
was
considered by IRC
Council
in
its
176*
meeting
held
on
12"^
November,
2005
in
Bhubaneswar and approved with certain modific-
ations. The required modifications were accord
ingly carried out by the Convenor, B-6 Committee
before sending the document for publication.
2.
SCOPE
These guidelines cover the specific design and
construction requirements pertaining to precast
pre-tensioned
girders, which may
constitute
a
superstructure system. Such
structural systems
may comprise of precast girders
in association
with
cast-in-situ/precast
deck
slab
and
diaphragms,
spliced
girder
system,
integral
bridge, etc. These superstructures may either be
simply
supported
or
continuous.
In
case
of
continuous superstructures, the continuity may be
achieved
either
through
untensioned
reinforcement
at
the
intermediate
supports
or
through post-tensioning.
In
pre-tensioning,
the
tendons
are
prestressed
before
concreting
and
prestress

transferred to the concrete, through bond, when it
attains
the
requisite
minimum
strength
and
maturity; whereas, in the case of post tensioning,
tendons are prestressed after concrete gains the
requisite minimum strength and maturity. Fig.
1 &
2 give examples of precast pre-tensioned girders
made continuous over supports. Fig. 3 & 4 depict
an example of a pre-tensioned girder indicating
bonded and debonded tendons. Fig. 5 depicts a
few possible shapes ofstirrups precast girder.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Design shall be done in accordance with the
provisions of IRC: 18 except for the additional
provisions
and/or
deviations
indicated
below.
However, clauses 17, 19, 20, 22, and 25 ofIRC: 18
are not applicable to pre-tensioning.
3.1. Material Properties
Where pre-tensioned girders constitute
a
part of the
overall
structural system, which
is
constructed in various stages, the properties of
materials used in the analysis and design shall
take
into
account
the
methodology
and
the
sequence in which the same is constructed. If the
concrete
strengths
in two components
of the
composite member differ by more than 10 MPa,
allowance
for
this
shall be made
in assessing
stiffnesses and stresses.
3.2. Permissible Stress in Concrete
3.2.1.
Permissible
Temporary
Stresses
in
Concrete
:
While the other limits shall apply as
per clause 7. 1 ofIRC: 1 8, the minimum strength of
concrete at transfer shall be such that it satisfies
stress
check
at
all
stages
of
construction.
Minimum characteristic strength (f^J of concrete
shall be M40 and minimum strength at transfer of
prestress shall be 0.8
f,^ or 35MPa, whichever is
lesser. Use of High Performance Concrete and/or
steam curing may be made to achieve high early
strength of concrete.
In case of debonding of
strands, check of stresses at the point of start of
debonding
shall
be made
by
excluding
the
debonded strands. The debonded strands shall be
taken
to
be
fiiUy
effective
at
the
end
of
transmission length. Intermediate values (arrived
at
by
straight
line
interpolation
fi-om
zero
effectiveness
at
the
start
of bonding
to
full
effectiveness
at the end of transmission length)
may be used for intermediate locations. It is, often
necessary to provide a few strands at top of the
precast girder also, in order to control the tensile
stresses at top during handling.
3.2.2. Permissible Stresses in Concrete During
Service
:
While
other
limits
of permissible
stresses remain the same
as those covered
in
clause 7.2 of IRC: 1 8, stresses at top of the precast
girder may be allowed to go into tension at the
locations
where
top
section
is
designed
as
reinforced concrete section, which is a common
practice in case of precast pretensioned girders
made continuous using cast-in-situ RCC deck slab
and diaphragm. However, tensile stresses at the
top of precast pretensioned girder shall be limited
to
0.36^fck.
Adequately designed untensioned
reinforcement shall be provided to take care ofthis
tension.
3.3. Minimum Dimensions
All provisions relating to minimum concrete
dimensions shall be as per clause 9.3.1 of IRC: 18
except for the following limitations relating to
various structural components which will prevail
over the corresponding values ofthe Code:
Thickness of top flange
Thickness of bottom flange
Thickness of web
Thickness of deck slab where
top flanges are contiguous
100mm
150mm
150mm
150mm
Note
: The minimum web thickness
indicated
above applies to T' and T shaped girders.
In case of other special types of sections,
minimum web thickness may be decided
on
the
basis
of appropriate
specialist
literature.
;
3.4. Minimum Reinforcement
In order to meet the requirement ofminimum
untensioned steel as per IRC: 18 or IRC: 21, the
available high tensile steel (bonded only) may be
assumed
to
constitute
this
requirement,
considering it at same strength as the untensioned
steel.
3.5. Losses in Prestress
The losses due
to creep and shrinkage of
concrete
shall
be
calculated
in
the
manner
stipulated
in IRC:
18,
taking due
account of
various stages of loading. Losses due to seating
and friction are not applicable to pre-tensioning.
Losses due to elastic shortening and relaxation of
tendons,
differ from those in the case of post-
tensioning. These can be calculated as follows:
3.5. 1
Elastic Shortening of Concrete The loss of
stress (fpEs in MPa) in the prestressing steel in pre-
tensioned girder shall be calculated as:
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:71-2006
pES
-rp
cgp
Where,
=
sum of concrete stresses at the centre of
gravity of prestressing tendons due to the
prestressing force at transfer and the self-
weight of the member at the sections of
maximum moment (MPa)
Ep
=
modulus of elasticity of prestressing steel
(MPa)
=
modulus
of
elasticity
of
concrete
at
transfer (MPa)
Note
: The above method
is different from that
given in clause
11.1 of IRC: 18 as unlike
post-tensioning,
all
the
strands
are
stressed at the same time and the forces
transferred
to
the
concrete
simultaneously.
3.5.2.
Calculations of Losses due to Relaxation
of Prestressing Steel
: In the case ofpretensioned
concrete, relaxation losses
start as soon
as the
pretensioning is carried out, whereas, the effect of
the same on the concrete begins only after the
prestressing force is transferred to the concrete. In
this regard, relaxation losses shall be calculated as
per Table 4A and 4B of IRC: 1 8 for assessment of
actu- ally available prestressing force at transfer.
In case of steam curing, variation of pattern of
relaxation loss with temperature and time shall be
assessed on the
basis of appropriate
specialist
literature.
3.6. Cover and Spacing of Prestressing Steel
Requirements of cover of prestressing steel
associated with pre-tensioned concrete
shall be
as
per
the
provisions
for
untensioned
reinforcement. Minimum centre to centre spacing
of strands shall be 44mm and 5 1mm for 12.7 mm
and
15.2 mm
strands.
However,
precautions
should be taken
to
locate
prestressing
strands
in such a way that cutting of projecting strands
at the ends of girders does not affect the projecting
untensioned
reinforcement,
which
is
required
to
be
bonded
into
the
adjoining
cast-in-situ
concrete. In case the designs cater for utilization
of bonded
strands
as
passive
reinforcement
extending from precast girder into the adjoining
cast-in-situ concrete,
stress in the strands
shall
be limited to that in the adjoining reinforcing steel,
in order to maintain strain compatibility. In such
case, these strands shall not be cut.
3.7.
Transmission Length of Tendons
The transmission length
is defined as the
length over which a tendon develops its fiill stress
capacity through bond with the concrete.
The transmission length depends on a number of
variables, the most important being:
(a)
The degree ofcompaction ofthe concrete.
(b)
The strength ofthe concrete.
(c)
The size and type oftendon.
(d)
The deformation (e.g. crimp) ofthe tendon.
(e)
The stress in the tendon and
( f)
The surface condition ofthe tendon.
The transmission lengths for the tendon, towards
the top ofa unit, is usually greater than those at the
bottom.
Where the initial prestressing force is not greater
than 90% of 0. 1% proof stress of the tendon and
where the concrete strength at transfer is not less
than 30MPa,
the
transmission
length
shall be
taken as follows
:
,_ kjO
^/^
V
CI
Where
is the concrete strength at transfer (in MPa)
1,
is the transmission length (in mm)
O
is
the nominal diameter of the tendon
(in
mm)
k,
is
a
coefficient dependent on
the type of
tendon to be taken as 240 for 7 wire standard
and super strand as per
18:14268
The
development
of
stresses
over
the
transmission
length
shall be assumed
to vary
linearly from
zero
at
the
start of the bonded
portion
to
maximum
stress
at
the
end
of
transmission length.
If the tendons are prevented from bonding to
the concrete near the ends ofthe units by the use of
HDPE tubes,
sleeves or tape, the transmission
lengths should be taken from the ends of the
debonded portions.

3.8. Development Length ofTendons
. Pre-tensioned
tendons
shall
be
bonded
beyond
the
point,
where
they
are no
longer
required for stress control, to a distance equal to
40 times the nominal strand diameter.
3.9. Second Order Effects

cases where simply
supported
precast
girders
are made continuous
using diaphragm

isostatic
(simply
supported)
to
hyperstatic (continuous) shall be accounted for. In
addition, due to the difference of age of precast
girders and
that of the
cast-in-situ deck
slab,
intrinsic
stresses
are developed on account of
differential
shrinkage.
These
shall
be
incorporated appropriately in the design.
Suggested method of calculating
these second
order effects is as follows:
Stepl:
Calculate Creep = Residual Creep Strain/Elastic
Factor 9
Strain
= Residual Creep Strain x E^j
,
Elastic Stress
where E^j
= Elastic Modulus of girder
concrete at the time of
establishing continuity
NOTE
: An increase or reduction of 15% on this
value of ^ should be taken to cater for
unfavorable variations.
Step 2:
Calculate Creep Coefficient
= 1 -e^
Step 3:
Calculate factor to account for effect of creep on
differential shrinkage 9 sh
~
(1 -Q ^)
Step 4:
Apply
those
dead
loads
and
prestressing
on
hyperstatic structure which were actually applied
on isostatic structure.
Step 5:
Bending moments so obtained at the intermediate
support are termed as restraint moments due to
dead
load M^r
and
restraint moment
due
to
prestress Mp^.
Step 6:
Calculate
restraint
moments
due
to
differential shrinkage between
cast-in-situ
slab
and precast girder, which occur on a hyperstatic
structure, by any suitable method.
Step?:
The
final
restraint
moment
(sagging)
at
any intermediate support shall
be calculated as
Mr = (MpR - Mdr) X 9cr
- MsHX9sh
The final restraint moment diagram is assumed to
vary
linearly between supports with values of
respective
at intermediate supports and zero at
the end supports.
Step 8:
Add bending moments due to other effects such as
DL, SIDE, EE, differential settlement etc (as they
occur) to the Mr for the design purpose. Effect of
eigen stress due to differential shrinkage shall also
be accounted for.
Notes:
(i) Alternatively,
any
other
method
of
calculating second order effects may be used
based on appropriate specialist literature.
(ii)
It should be kept
in view
that
the above
mentioned creep and shrinkage take place
over a long period oftime.
(iii) Calculation of safety
at ultimate moments
may exclude the above second order effects.
3.10.
Continuity by Post-Tensioning
In
case
continuity
is
achieved using
post
tensioning,
the
prestress may be
imparted
to
girder section alone, where loads of deck slab,
diaphragm, SIDE, live loads etc. act on a contin-
uous
structure. Alternatively,
prestress may be
imparted
after
casting
of
deck
slab
and
diaphragms, where the loads of deck slab and
diaphragms only will
act on simply supported
structure and SIDE, live loads etc, will act on the
continuous structure.
3.11.
Additional
Treatment
at
Girder-
Diaphragm Interface
The
girder- diaphragm
interface
is usually
9



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:71-2006
located at a crucial location where shear forces are
high and in case of continuous spans, bending
moments are also high. At these interfaces, apart
from adequate preparation of the
construction
joint, as illustrated elsewhere in this document, a
suitably
designed
longitudinal
reinforcement
extending from the precast girder into the cast-in-
situ concrete, adequate
to withstand the shear
force across the interface shall be provided. This
reinforcement shall be in addition to the vertical
shear reinforcement.
3.12.
Confining Reinforcement
Bottom bulbs of pre-tensioned
girders
are
highly stressed at the ends ofbonded prestressing.
To guard against the crushing failure ofconcrete, a
reinforcement equal to atleast 10mm dia TOR @
150mm c/c shall be provided in an appropriate
shape to enclose the strands over a length of
1 .5
times depth of the girder from the ends. Stirrups
should be detailed not to be in contact with sfrands
3.13.
Bursting Reinforcement
The
bursting
resistance
of
pre-tensioned
anchorage
zone
provided
by
vertical
reinforcement in the ends of pre-tensioned beams
shall be taken as:
Where:
f3 = stress in steel not exceeding 1 40 MPa
A, ^- total area of vertical reinforcement located
with in the distance h/5 from the end of the
beam (mm^)
h = overall depth ofprecast membeT (mm)
The bursting resistance
shall not be less than 4
percent ofthe presfressing force at transfer.
The end vertical reinforcement shall be as close to
the end ofthe beam as practicable.
3.14.
Losses of Prestress due to Steam Curing
Where
steam
curing
is
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
prestressed
concrete
units,
variations in the behavior of the material at higher
than normal temperatures need to be considered.
In addition, where the 'long-line' method of pre-
tensioning is used, there may be additional losses
as a result of bond developed between the tendon
and
the
concrete when
the tendon
is hot and
relaxed. Since the actual losses of prestress due to
steam curing are a function ofthe techniques used
by the various manufacturers,
specialist advice
should be sought.
3.15. Shear Connectors
Shear
connectors
between
the
mating
surfaces of precast girder and cast-in-situ deck
slab shall be designed as per the provisions of
IRC:22.
3.16.
Reinforcement
to
cater
for
Indirect
Support
When
the main beams
are
not
directly
supported by the bearing and are supported on the
cross
girder during
service
or
during bearing
replacement,
suspension
stirrups
shall
be
provided to take up reaction applied by hanging
action. This reinforcement shall be in addition to
what
is
required
from
other
structural
considerations. The purpose of this reinforcement
is to transfer the vertical shear from girder to top of
the
associated
diaphragm.
This
reinforcement
shall be
designed using
appropriate
specialist
literature.
3.17. Handling Stresses
Precast units should be designed to resist,
without permanent damage,
all stresses induced
by handling, storage, fransportation and erection.
The
position of
lifting and
supporting
points
should be
specified. The
design
should
take
account of the effect of lifting and placing on to
supports. All locations of high concentration of
stresses in precast members as well as the concrete
members (over which the precast members are
supported temporarily or permanently) should be
provided
with
closely
spaced
reinforcement
mesh, close to the surface of contact to prevent
local crushing ofconcrete.
4.
CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Minimum cement content, maximum water-
cement ratio and other durability requirements
shall be the same as indicated in Table 5 ofIRC:2
1
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:71-2006
except minimum grade ofconcrete, which shall be
M40 for pre-tensioned girders
.
4.1
Precasting
All sides, bottoms and header forms shall be
of steel or any other suitable material. Forms shall
be of sufficient thickness, with adequate external
bracing and
shall be
stiffened and adequately
anchored to withstand the forces due to placement
and vibration of concrete. All joints of form work
shall be leak proof. The bottom shutter shall have
arrangement to permit longitudinal movement of
girder concrete, which happens while imparting
prestress. Identifying marks shall be placed on the
girders to indicate the correct orientation to ensure
correct debonding locations, which may not be
symmetrical, longitudinally.
Compaction of concrete may be achieved
through needle vibrators or form vibrators along
with
needle
vibrators.
For
casting
of precast
beams, any of the two commonly known techni-
ques ofprecasting viz. (i) Long Line method or (ii)
Short Line method may be
used.
It
shall be
ensured that tolerances mentioned in para 4. 1 0 are
strictly adhered to.
The girders shall not be moved from the
casting
location
until
stipulated
strength
requirements have been attained. The concrete
shall
have
attained
a minimum
compressive
strength of 20 MPa
at the time of removal of
forms.
Curing
of
concrete may
be
achieved
through water or steam followed by water curing.
Approved curing compound may also be used
Longitudinal movement of the girders that
takes place while releasing the prestress shall be
suitably catered for. In case of long line method of
precasting,
adequate
longitudinal gap
shall be
provided between girder ends during precasting to
accommodate
projecting
reinforcement
and
required length ofthe projecting strands.
4.2.
Pretensioning Operation
Pretensioning of strands may be carried out
either using single pull jack or multi pull jack. In
case of the former,
it shall be ensured,
at each
stage, that the strands are stressed symmetrically,
so that the supporting system of the strands does
not rotate or distort. This may be achieved through
suitably designed moving trolley engaging the
strands
or
any
other
suitable
arrangement.
Prestressing force shall be transferred to metallic
spacer,
trolley,
etc.
so
that the
force does not
remain on the hydraulic system for long.
It is necessary to apply a small prestressing
force, through hydraulic jacks to remove slackn-
ess of the strands. After removal of the slackness,
the
strands must
be
thoroughly
examined
to
ensure correct alignment, including that of the
debonding tubes. Reference marks for measuring
elongation shall then be established and the full
strand load is applied thereafter. Loads indicated
by gauging system shall control the tensioning,
with elongation checked on every strand.
It shall be ensured that the entire length of
each
strand between
the
grips
is
free of any
defects. This
is of particular importance while
precasting girders using long line method entai-
ling, longer pieces ofstrands between the grips.
4.3. Detensioning of Strands
Detensioning,
in
order
to
impart
the
prestress, shall be effected gradually, so that there
is no significant loss of bond due to slippage of
strands
and
consequent
increase
in
the
transmission length. For detensioning, the trolley
is pulled outward by a small distance, in order to
release the metallic spacers, before releasing the
prestressing force. Even when the pre-tensioning
is carried out through single pull jack, the release
of the force in all the strands, while imparting the
prestress to the concrete, shall be simultaneous. It
shall
be
ensured
that,
during
this
process,
prestressing forces at any stage does not exceed
90% of0. 1% proofstress.
4.4
Cutting of Strands
Cutting of strands is an important operation
in case of pre-tensioned girders because they are
in
close
proximity
with
the
untensioned
reinforcement which
is required to be extended
into the adjoining cast-in-situ concrete. Diamond
bit saw shall be used to cut the strands. Strands and
untensioned reinforcement shall be so arranged
that
the
untensioned
reinforcement and
those
strands which are required to be extended into the
adjoining cast-in-situ concrete, do not get affected
during cutting operation.
11



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:71-2006
Under factory conditions, flame cutting may
be
resorted to. Yellow flame should be used first
to
heat
the
strand without
introducing undue
stresses and then blue flame for the actual cutting.
Heat
cutting
of
strands
shall
be
carried
out
symme-trically
about
the
vertical
axis
of the
members. One strand at a time on each side of the
vertical axis for all girders in a long line shall be
cut. The next two strands of all the girders shall be
cut in the same manner. The above process shall
be repeated
till all the strands are cut. This will
ensure gradual uniform transfer of prestress
to
girders.
4.5
Debondingof Strands
Debonding of strands, wherever required,
shall be carried out using HDPE debonding tubes.
PVC tubes shall not be permitted for this purpose.
After
pretensioning
the
strands
and
before
concreting, a recheck shall be made to ensure that
the debonding tubes are placed
at the intended
locations. Both ends of the debonding tubes shall
be
effectively
sealed
against
ingress
of any
cement
slurry using epoxy putty or any other
suitable
material.

Concreting
A
fully
automated,
computer-controlled
batching plant shall be used. The batching plant
shall be provided with moisture measuring and
compensating devices and automatic pump
for
dispensing admixtures.
Sampling and testing of concrete shall be as
per the provisions of IRC:21. Additional cubes
shall
be
prepared
to
determine
the
concrete
strength
at the time of removal of forms and
transfer ofprestress. Adequate number ofsamples
shall be taken for this purpose, which shall be
cured
in
identical
conditions
to
those
of the
concrete ofrespective girders.
4.7
Surface Preparation
All surfaces, coming in contact with deck
slab/diaphragm shall be adequately prepared by
green
cutting,
using
surface
retarders,
or by
mechnical means to remove the laitance and just
expose the aggregates. Usually, precast girders
12



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:7 1-2006
join the cast-in-situ concrete of end diaphragms at
the points of high shear
stress. Therefore,
it
is
extremely important to adequately prepare the end
faces of the girders for effective bonding with the
new concrete. This shall be done using suitable
mechanical means (such
as 100% hacking)
to
ensure that the course aggregates are just exposed.
Surface
retarders, may
also
be
used
for
this
purpose.
4.8
Deflected Tendons
An effective way of making long span pre-
tensioned
girder
feasible
is
to
use
deflected
tendons
instead
of
the
conventional
straight
tendons. This requires the use of hold-up/ hold-
down devices at each deflection location, in order
to hold the tendons
in the desired profile and
location. Ahold-down device normally consists of
rollers attached to a vertical rod, which passes
through the bottom form and is anchored to the
form
substructure
or
foundation
to
resist
the
vertical component of the prestress
force. The
force which must be resisted by the hold-up
/
hold-down device, and therefore its size, depends
on
the number
of deflected
strands
and
the
trajectory angle ofthe strands.
One
method
of
producing
deflected
tendon
profile
is
to use hold-up
/ hold-down
devices
to
raise
the
profile
of
the
strand
at
the
ends
of beams
and
then
tension
the
strands in their already deflected profile. Other
method is to
hold-up / hold-down the strand
to
the proper elevation after tensioning the strands.
Again,
the number
of
deflected
strands
and
their
angle
directly
influence
the
size
and
cost of the hold-up
/ pick-up
device.
Fig.
7
shows
a
typical
deflected
strand
profile
in
a
prestressingbed.
For single tendons, the deflector in contact
with the tendon, should produce a radius of not
less than 5 times the tendon diameter for wire or
10 times the tendon diameter for strand and total
angle ofdeflection should not exceed 1 5
.

to view or to corrosive materials in the completed
structure, the depth of removal of the embedded
material
and
method
of
filling
the
cavities
after
removal
shall
be
as
shown
on
the

depth
of removal
shall not be
less than the clear cover required
to the reinforcing
steel. The cavity so formed
shall
be
suitably
grouted
for
protecting
the
embedded
metal.
Also,
the
projecting
reinforcement shall
be suitably protected against
corrosion.
Method of transportation should be planned
in
such
a way
that
the
vehicle employed
to
transport
the
long
girders
can
successfully
negotiate the available road geometry. Adequate
care shall be taken to ensure that the girder being
transported
does
not
topple
due
to
unstable
arrangement. For this purpose, height of vehicle
shall be kept as low as possible. This will also
help
in accommodating
greater
height
of the
system
during
transportation
below
existing
bridges or through any other constraints. Girders
should be transported only after 28 day concrete
strength is achieved.
