1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
Road signs, which have the backing of law in
India, are incorporated
in the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988.
1 .2
The Motor Vehicles Act,
1 988 has covered all the signs warranted by different traffic
situations. The designs of signs are fully dimensioned. Further, the signs have uniformity, and
mostly symbols are used to convey the message, especially in the case of regulatory signs.
1 .3
The IRC Code of Practice for Road Signs sets out the methodology to be followed in
the use, placement, construction and maintenance of the road signs for all categories of roads
including expressways. The road signs adopted in this code are in harmony with Protocol on
Road Signs and Signals of United Nations Conference on Road and Motor Transport, 1949
and Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, 1968.
1.4
The Second Revision of IRC Code of Practice for Road Signs was reviewed by the
Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee of the Indian Roads
Congress
in
its meeting
held on 13
th October, 2010 based on comments received from
some members and
it constituted a Sub-group with Shri Nirmal Jit Singh as the Convenor
and including Shri D.P. Gupta, Dr. (Mrs.) Geetam Tiwari and Shri S.B. Basu as members to
review the code and suggest modifications/amendments if any required. The Sub-group after
deliberations further Co-opted Prof. P. K. Sikdar, Shri Jacob George and Dr. Surinder Mohan
as co-opted members of the above Sub-group considering their rich experience. The entire
Sub-group reviewed the document in detail and restructured
it by relating size and spacing
of signs with respect to design speed of the road, including guidelines for selection of retro-
reflective sheeting, incorporating some new signs and including illustrative examples of sign
plans for different commonly occurring situations. The modified code was considered by
the Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (Personnel given
below) in
its meeting held on 13
th September, 2011 and approved for forwarding to IRC for
consideration by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee after modifications
based on comments of the members.

in
its
meeting held on 23
rd September, 2011. Thereafter, the Council of IRC
in
its meeting held
at Lucknow on 3
rd November, 2011 considered the Third Revision' of IRC-67 presented by
Shri Nirmal Jit Singh, Convenor of the Sub-group and approved the document for publication
suggesting minor modifications. The Council also authorized Shri Nirmal Jit Singh to oversee
the incorporation of the minor comments and suggestions of the Council before
it
is sent
for printing. Further, a small group consisting of Shri Nirmal Jit Singh (Convenor), Prof. P.K.
Sikdar, Shri Jacob George and Dr.S.Velmurugan accomplished the above tasks of addressing
the comments/suggestions of the Council and submitted the final version of the document to
IRC for printing.
2 GENERAL
2,1
Purpose of Road Signs
The purpose of road signs
is to promote road safety and efficiency by providing
for the
orderly movement of all road users on
all roads
in both urban and non-urban areas. Road
signs notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for safe,
uniform and efficient operation.

IRC: 67-2012
2.2
Principles of Road Signs
This Code contains the basic principles that govern the design and use of road signs for all
categories of roads including expressways open to public travel irrespective of road agency
having jurisdiction.
It
is important that these
principles be given primary consideration
in the selection and
application of each road sign. To be effective, a road sign should meet five basic requirements:
a)
Fulfill a need;
b)
Command attention;
c)
Convey a clear and simple meaning;
d)
Command respect from road users; and
e)
Give adequate time for response.
Design,
placement,
operation,
maintenance, and
uniformity are aspects
that should be
carefully considered
in order to maximize the ability of a road sign to meet these five basic
requirements.
2.3
Placement and Operation of Road Signs
Placement of road signs should be within road
user's view. To aid
in conveying proper
meaning, road signs should be positioned with respect to the location or situation to which
it applies. The location and legibility of the road sign should be such as to provide adequate
response time to road users to read and take action at the operating speed. Road signs or
their supports shall not bear any advertising or other message that
is not related to traffic
control. However,
tourist-oriented
directional signs and signs
relating
to specific wayside
services and amenities should not be considered as advertising. Road signs should be placed
and operated in a uniform and consistent manner. Road signs which are not necessary or no
longer required should be removed. The fact that a sign
is in good physical condition should
not be a basis for deferring the removal or change,
if
it is so warranted.
2.4
Maintenance of Road Signs
Maintenance of road signs should be ensured to retain both the legibility and the visibility of
the sign. Functional evaluation of road signs should be done to determine at regular periodic
intervals, whether certain signs need to be changed to meet current traffic conditions. Clean,
legible, properly mounted signs in good working condition command respect from road users.
2.5
Uniformity of Road Signs
Uniformity of signs simplifies the task of the road user because
it helps
in recognition and
understanding, thereby reducing
perception/reaction
time.
Uniformity assists road
users,
traffic police and highway agencies by giving everyone the same interpretation message.
Uniformity also promotes efficiency in manufacture, installation and maintenance. Uniformity
means treating
similar situations
in a
similar way. A standard
sign, used where
it
is not
appropriate,
is as objectionable as a nonstandard sign.

IRC: 67-2012
2.6
Traffic Engineering Study
The decision to use a particular sign at a particular location should be made on the basis of
traffic engineering study and after a very careful planning so that correct and uniform signs
are placed at required locations.
Authorities
with
responsibility
for
traffic
control
that do
not have
in-house
engineering
assistance can take help from
traffic engineering consultant(s) or academic and research
institutions with domain expertise.
3 CLASSIFICATION OF ROAD SIGNS
Road signs are classified under the following three heads:
3.1
Mandatory/Regulatory Signs
All
Mandatory
or Regulatory Signs
are
circular
in
shape.
Mandatory/Prohibitory
Signs
are
to
indicate
the
prohibition
upon
certain
kind
of
vehicle maneuver and vehicle type like "overtaking
prohibited"
or
"U-turn
prohibited"
or
"cycles
prohibited" and restriction on parking like "parking
prohibited" and limit on vehicle speed and size like
"speed
limit" and "maximum load
limit"
. They are
with red circular ring and diagonal bars with black
symbols or arrows or letters on white background.
The
red
ring
indicates
prohibitory
regulation;
and the diagonal red bar prohibits the action or
movement indicated by the black symbol.
Mandatory signs
giving
positive
instructions are
circular with white symbol on a blue background.
They indicate what driver must do compulsorily.
Prohibitory
Regulation
Operational
Control
Compulsory
Direction Control
For
example,
direction
control
signs
are
to
Fi9- 3.1
compulsorily regulate certain movements wherever the restriction applies.
The exceptions
in shape are the octagonal red STOP sign and the triangular GIVEWAY or
YIELD sign. These two signs provide indication about right of way to drivers.
Mandatory and regulatory signs need to be complied with and any violation of the rules and
regulations conveyed by these signs is a legal offence. Examples of these signs are shown
in Fig. 3.1.

IRC: 67-2012
3.2
Cautionary/Warning Signs
Cautionary/Warning
signs
are
triangular
in
shape with red border and black symbol
in white
background
used
to
caution and
alert
the
road
users
to
potential danger or existence of certain
hazardous conditions either on or adjacent to the
roadway so that they take the desired action. These
signs indicate a need
for special caution by road
users and may require a reduction in speed or some
other manoeuvre. Some examples of these signs
are Hairpin Bend, Narrow Bridge, Gap
in Median,
School Ahead etc. An example is shown in Fig. 3.2.

Informatory Signs
for
facilities
indicates
location

place" or "parking" and shall be a symbol within a
rectangular board with blue background.
Information
signs
in
rectangular shape
are
also
used
with
destination names and distances with
arrows indicating the direction. The colour pattern
of
direction
information
sign
is
presented
in
Table 8.3. These are used to give such information
to road users which will help them along the route in
most simple and direct manner. Examples of these
are shown in Fig. 3.3.
3.4
Road Classifications
Generally roads are classified as under:
a)
Expressways
b)
National Highways
c)
State Highways
d)
Major District Roads
e)
Rural Roads (Other District Roads (ODR) and Village Roads (VR))
f)
Urban (City) Roads
The
direction
information signs for different categories of road
will have
different colour
combinations as given in Table 8.3.

IRC: 67-2012
4 SITING OF SIGNS WITH RESPECT TO THE CARRIAGEWAY
4.1
The road signs are the means of communication to the road users, especially drivers.
Therefore, the signs shall be so placed that the drivers can recognize them easily and in time.
Normally the signs shall be placed on the
left hand side of the road. For two lane roads,
normally the signs may be placed on the
left side of the carriageway, repeated on the other
side of the carriageway,
if local conditions are such that the signs might not be seen
in time
by the drivers. For multilane divided roads the signs may be placed on
left side of each
carriageway.
In case of hill roads, the signs shall generally be installed on the valley side of
the road, unless traffic and road conditions warrant these to be placed on the
hill side.
4.2
On
all roads with or without kerb and with or without shoulder, the extreme edge of
the ground mounted sign adjacent to the roadway shall be at a distance of 600 mm to 3 m
from the carriageway or paved shoulder edge depending upon the local conditions. For roads
with kerbs,
it shall not be less than 300 mm away from kerb line, but in no case shall any part
of the sign come in the way of vehicular traffic.
Gantry mounted signs should be mounted on columns preferably 7 m or more from the
nearest traffic lane, unless otherwise specified. The minimum
lateral offset
is intended to
keep
it away from vehicles that may use the shoulder from striking the gantry column.
If there
is a situation where this lateral clearance cannot be maintained, the column of gantry sign
shall be shielded with W-Beam crash barrier for required run out length depending upon the
setback distance between the pavement edge line and column of gantry. Lesser clearances
but not less than 1.8 m may be used on connecting roadways or ramps at interchanges.
4.3
On kerbed roads, the bottom edge of the lowest sign shall not be less than 2.1 m
and not more than 2.5 m above the kerb. On roads without kerb, the bottom edge of the
lowest sign shall not be less than 2 m and not more than 2.5 m above the crown of the
pavement. Where signs are erected above footpaths or in areas likely or intended to be used
by pedestrians, minimum headroom of 2.1 m is to be provided.
4A
Where in the opinion of the competent authority, a sign would be ineffective
if placed
on the left hand side shoulder of a road with dual carriageway,
it may be placed on the median
instead. To improve the visibility of the signs on multi-lane roads, the minimum height of the
lower edge of the sign should be kept as 2.5 m above the highest point of the carriageway.
4.5
The signs
shall be so placed
that these do not obstruct vehicular
traffic on the
carriageway, and
if placed on the berm/footpath/refuge island cause
least obstruction
to
pedestrians. The difference in level between the lower edge of the sign and the carriageway
shall be as uniform as possible for signs of the same class on the same route.
M
On multi-lane roads, the signs may have to be mounted overhead, as this would
ensure better visibility and be effective
in communicating with the drivers and other road
users. Overhead signs may be used
in lieu of, or as an adjunct to, ground signs where the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
situation so warrants for proper information and guidance of the road
user. The following
conditions may be considered while deciding about the provision of overhead signs:
•
Traffic volume at or near capacity
•
Complex interchange design
•
Three or more lanes in each direction
•
Restricted visibility
•
High speed traffic
•
Insufficient space for ground mounted signs
•
Large percentage of commercial vehicles
•
Closely spaced interchanges
4.7
From safety and aesthetic standpoints, overhead signs shall be mounted on overhead
bridge structures wherever possible. Overhead signs shall provide a vertical clearance of not
less than 5.5 m over the entire width of the pavement and shoulders. Where overhead sign
supports cannot be placed at a safe distance away from the line of traffic or in an otherwise
protected site, they should either be so designed as to minimize the impact forces or protect
motorists adequately by a physical barrier or guard
rail of suitable design. Encompassing all
above requirements, the placement of signs with respect to carriageway with required height
and clearance is given in Table 4.1 and Fig. 4.1.
4.8
Mandatory signs (e.g. Keep Left) on traffic islands are normally mounted so that the
bottom edge
is about 1000 mm above the paved surface. When several signs have to be
placed along the same section of road, take care that they do not obscure each other. And
then locate the signs at a minimum of 0.6*V meters apart (where V
is the 85
th percentile
speed in km/h). Signs are normally erected on the left side of the road, but for extra emphasis
a second sign may be placed on the right side of the road as well. This
is especially useful
on left-hand curves. Wherever minimum lateral clearance cannot be maintained for gantry
columns from shoulder edge line, such exposed column shall be protected with crash barrier.

5 ORIENTATION OF SIGNS
5.1
The signs unless otherwise stated shall normally be placed at right angles to the
line of travel of the approaching
traffic. Signs relating
to
parking,
however,
should
be
fixed
at
an
angle
(approximately)
15° to the carriageway so as to give
better visibility.
5.2
Where
light
reflection
from
the
sign
face
is
encountered to such an extent as to reduce
legibility,
the sign should be turned slightly away from the road as
shown in Fig. 5.1
. On horizontal curves, the sign should
not be fixed normal to the carriageway but the angle
of placement should be determined with regard to the
course of the approaching traffic.
5.3
Sign faces are normally vertical, but on gradients
it may be desirable to
tilt a sign forward or backward
from the vertical to make
it normal to the line of sight
and improve the viewing angle.

Retro Reflective Sheeting
The retro reflective sheeting used on the signs shall consist of white or coloured sheeting
having a smooth outer surface which has the property of retro reflection over its entire surface.
It shall be weather resistant and exhibit colour fastness.
It shall be new and unused and show
no evidence of cracking, scaling, and pitting, blistering, edge lifting or curling and shall have
negligible shrinkage or expansion. A certificate of having the sheeting tested for coefficient of
retro reflection, daytime colour and luminance, shrinkage, flexibility, liner removal, adhesion,
impact resistance, specular gloss and fungus resistance, 3 years outdoor weathering and
its having passed these tests shall be obtained from International/Government Laboratory/
Institute by the manufacturer of the sheeting and
in case the certificate
is obtained from
international agency,
it should also be obtained from Indian agency within 3 years of launching
of product by the manufacture
in abroad. Alternatively, a
certificate conforming to ASTM
Specification (D 4956-09) on
artificial accelerated weathering requirements from a reputed
laboratory in India can be accepted provisionally.
In such a situation, the Employer/Client,
if
so desires, could seek for a performance guarantee which would be released after receipt of
certificate meeting the requirement of three years outdoor weathering of the sheeting. Retro
reflective sheeting
is divided into three classes as follows:
10



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
CLASS A SHEETING:
- Engineering and Super Engineering Grade Sheeting as per ASTM.
D 4956-09 Type
I and
II.
CLASS B SHEETING:
- High Intensity and High Intensity Prismatic grade sheeting as per
ASTM D 4956-09 Type
III and
IV.
CLASS C SHEETING:
- All Micro Prismatic grade sheets as per ASTM D 4956-09 Type VIII,
IX and XI.
6.7.1
Selection of sheeting
Performance characteristics of sheeting Type
I to Type IX used for road signs are presented
respectively
in Table 6.3 to Table 6.9. The definition of key words
in understanding the
performance characteristics are given below.
"Retro-reflection" means the reflection of light which
is returned
in directions close to the
direction from which
it came, and this property being maintained even over wide variations of
the direction of the incident radiation.
"Observation
angle (symbol
a)"
is
the
angle between
the
illumination
axis and
the
observation axis as shown in Fig. 6.1.
Fig. 6.1
"Entrance angle (symbol p)" means the angle from the illumination axis to the reference
axis. The reference axis
is an axis perpendicular to the retro reflective surface as shown
in
Fig. 6.2.
Fig. 6.2

======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
"Coefficient of retro-reflection R'
" can be obtained from the luminous intensity
(I) of the
retro-reflective area
in the direction of observation and the illumination (E
-L
) on the retro-
reflective plane at right angles to the direction of the incident light and the illuminated plane
sample surface A,
R' =
I
/ E -1* A
The coefficient of retro-reflection R' is expressed in candle per square meter per lux (cd.rrr2
.
lx
1 ).Though the sheeting as per ASTM classification are available from Type
I to Type IX, a
"higher" type of sheeting used
in the ASTM need not necessarily imply that
it is better than
a "lower"-type sheeting, rather
it meets different performance characteristics. Each type of
sheeting has certain performance characteristics and the type of sheeting for a road should
be selected which
suits the situation encountered by road users
in viewing the signs on
the particular road. For example, sheeting with high coefficient of retro reflection at small
observation angle will give better performance for driver's viewing the sign from long distances.
Similarly, signs with wide observation angle give good performance for drivers encountering
situations to observe the signs involving wide observation angle. Micro prismatic sheeting is
preferred for gantry mounted overhead signs. Type IV micro prismatic sheeting may be used
for delineator posts.
Table 6.2 suggests a general guideline for selection of sheeting considering the performance
characteristics of each type of sheeting for different category of roads and also on economic
consideration and visibility requirements in Indian context. However, the choice for selection
of type of sheeting would rest with the client.

6.7.5
Adhesives
The sheeting shall have a pressure-sensitive adhesive of the aggressive-tack type requiring
no heat, solvent or other preparation for adhesion to a smooth clean surface,
in a manner
recommended by the sheeting manufacturer. The adhesive shall be protected by an easily
removable liner (removable by peeling without soaking in water or other solvent) and shall be
suitable for the type of material of the base plate used for the sign. The adhesive shall form
a durable bond to smooth, corrosion and weather resistant surface of the base plate such
that
it shall not be possible to remove the sheeting from the sign base in one piece by use
of sharp instrument. The sheeting shall be applied
in accordance with the manufacturer's
specifications.
6.7.6
Fabrication
Surface to be reflectorised shall be effectively prepared to receive the retro-reflective sheeting.
The aluminium sheeting shall be de-greased either by acid or hot alkaline etching and' all
scale/dust removed to obtain a smooth plain surface before the application of retro-reflective
sheeting.
If the surface is rough, approved surface primer may be used. After cleaning, metal
shall not be handled, except by suitable device or clean canvas gloves, between all cleaning
and preparation operation and application of reflective sheeting/primer. There shall be no
opportunity for metal to come
in contact with grease,
oil or other contaminants prior to the
application of retro-reflective sheeting. Complete sheets of the material shall be used on the
signs except where
it is unavoidable. At splices, sheeting with pressure-sensitive adhesives
shall be overlapped not less than 5 mm. Where screen printing with transparent colours
is
proposed, only butt joint shall be used. The material shall cover the sign surface evenly and
shall be free from twists, cracks and folds. Cut-outs to produce legends and borders shall be
bonded with the sheeting in the manner specified by the manufacturer.
6.8
Messages/Borders
The messages (legends, letters, numerals, etc.) and borders shall either be screen-printed
or of cut out from durable transparent overlay or cut-out from the same type of reflective
sheeting for the cautionary and mandatory sign boards. Screen printing shall be processed
and finished with materials and
in a manner specified by the sheeting manufacturer. For
the informatory and other sign boards, the messages (legends,
letters, numerals etc.) and
borders
shall be cut-out from durable transparent overlay
film or cut-out from the same
reflective sheeting
only. Cut-outs
shall be from durable transparent overlay materials as
specified by the sheeting manufacturer and shall be bonded with the sheeting in the manner
specified by the manufacturer. Whenever transparent overlay film
is used for making any
type of sign, the coloured portion of sign shall have coefficient of reflectivity not less than the
reflectivity of type and colour of sheeting normally used, as given
in Table 6.3 to Table 6.9.
Cut-out messages and borders, wherever used, shall be either made out of retro-reflective
sheeting or made out of durable transparent overlay except those in black which shall be of
non-reflective sheeting or opaque in case of durable transparent overlay. Creating coloured
areas by means of screen-printing with ink shall not be permitted.

IRC: 67-2012
6.9
Warranty and Durability
The retro reflective sheeting type "A", "B" and "C" shall be covered respectively under 5, 7
and 10 year warranty respectively issued for field performance including the screen printed
areas and cut-out sheeting and cut-out durable transparent overlay film. The contract shall
indicate the minimum retro-reflectivity of the signs at the end of the warranty period.
7 POSTS AND MOUNTINGS FOR SIGNS
7.1
The
traffic signs
shall be mounted on support posts, which may be of Gl pipes
conforming to IS 1239, Rectangular Hollow Section conforming to IS 4923 or Square Hollow
Section conforming to IS 3589. In case of signs supported on two or more posts,
if necessary,
bracing may also be provided. Sign posts, their foundations and sign mountings shall be so
constructed as to hold these
in a proper and permanent position against the normal storm
wind loads or displacement by vandalism. Normally, signs with an area up to 0.9 square
meter shall be mounted on a single post, and for greater area, two or more supports shall be
provided. Sign supports may be of mild steel, reinforced concrete (M25) or galvanized iron
(Gl Post) sections. End(s) shall be firmly fixed to the ground by means of properly designed
foundation. The work of foundation shall conform to relevant Specifications as specified.
7.2
All components of signs and supports, other than the reflective portion of Gl posts
shall be thoroughly descaled, cleaned, primed and painted with two coats of epoxy paint. Any
part of Mild Steel (MS) post below ground shall be painted with three coats of red lead paint.
7.3
The signs shall be fixed to the posts by welding
in the case of steel posts and by
bolts and washers of suitable size
in the case of reinforced concrete or Gl posts. After the
nuts have been tightened, the tails of the bolts shall be furred over with a hammer to prevent
removal.
7.4
For overhead
signs, the support system should be properly designed based on
sound engineering principles, to safely sustain the dead load, live load and wind load on the
completed sign system.
For this purpose, the overhead signs shall be designed to withstand
a wind loading of 150 kg/m 2 normal to the face of the sign and 30 kg/ m 2 transverse to the
face of the sign.
In addition to the dead load of the structure, walkway loading of 250 kg
concentrated live load shall also be considered for the design of the overhead sign structure.
8 COLOUR FOR SIGNS
8.1
Signs shall be provided with retro-reflective sheeting and/or overlay film as shown on
the detailed drawings. The reverse side of all signs shall be painted grey.
8.2
Except in the case of railway level crossing signs (for which the colour scheme
is
given
later) the sign posts shall be painted
in 250 mm wide bands, alternately black and
white. The lowest band next to the ground shall be in black.

The colour of the material shall be located within the area defined by the chromaticity
coordinates
in Table 8.1 and comply with the luminance factor given
in Table 8.2 when
measured as per ASTM D: 4956-09. Chromaticity is the objective specification of the quality
of a colour regardless of its luminance, that is, as determined by its hue and colourfulness (or
saturation/chroma, or intensity)

9 SIZE OF SIGNS
9.1
As a general rule, there shall be four sizes (small, medium, normal and large) of signs
for mandatory/regulatory and cautionary/warning signs. For Expressways, refer respective
chapters. For certain categories of mandatory/regulatory signs, a
still smaller size may be
used in conjunction with traffic light signals or on bollards on traffic islands.
9.2
General dimensions of different categories of signs are given in respective sections.
10 VISIBILITY OF SIGNS
In order to make signs more visible and legible at night, in particular cautionary/warning signs
and regulatory signs other than those regulating parking and stopping
in lighted streets of
built-up areas shall be lighted or provided with reflective material including luminous paints
or reflective devices and sheetings. Care should, however, be taken that this does not result
in road users becoming dazzled.
11
SIZE OF LETTERS
11.1
Letter size should be chosen with due regard to the speed, classification and location
of the road, so that the sign
is of adequate size for legibility but without being too large or
obtrusive. The size of the letter, in terms of x-height, to be chosen as per the design speed is
given in Table 11.1.

*Note: The values
in brackets are the minimum values to be adopted when there are site/space
constraints.
Derived from the first principle as presented in Annexure VI
Notes:
1)
For grade separated junction two or three advance direction signs are provided. These are
located at the start of diverging lane, 250 m to 750 m from the junction and additionally 750 m
to 1500 m from the junction.
2)
The "x" height
is the height of a lower case English "Transport medium" font and upper case
shall be 1.4 times of lower case height.
3)
In columns 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 11 of Table 11.1 the font heights shown are normal size to be used
for respective approach speeds and
in brackets are the absolute minimum sizes to be used
where site/space is limited. The font size can be increased by another 50 mm from the normal
font size for those direction boards requiring special emphasis/attention.

IRC: 67-2012
4)
In columns 4 and 9 of Table 11.1, the clear visibility distances indicated are minimum values.
Greater distances should be provided wherever possible.
5)
In columns 5 and 6 Table 11.1, the distances shown are for guidance only and are not to be
taken precise.
6)
Reassurance Signs are normally placed about 1 00-1 50 m after the junction. Place Identification
Signs are normally placed about 90 m to 150 m in advance of the start of the built-up area and
flag type direction signs are generally installed at the nose of diverging lanes.
7)
Columns 10, 11 and 12 of Table 11.1 shall be taken for design of gantry mounted signs.
11.2
Letter size on definition plates attached with normal sized signs should be 50 mm or
100 mm, and in the case of small signs,
it should be 50 mm. Where the message is long, as
for instance in "NO PARKING" and "NO STOPPING & NO STANDING" signs, the message
may be broken with two lines and the size of letters may be varied
in the lines so that the
definition plate
is not too large. The lettering on definition plates
will be
all
in upper case
letters. Example for Definition Plate is given in Plate
I.
12 MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS
12.1
Prior to installing any road sign, the responsibility for the maintenance of the sign
and the post is required to be decided, and the timing plan(s) should be clearly established.
Over time, signs become faded and their retro-reflective properties diminish. This reduces
both conspicuity and
legibility, by day and by night. Excessively discoloured or faded signs
(e.g. white backgrounds which have become grey or brown, or red borders faded to pink)
and signs, where the legend or graphic
is peeling off cannot be fully effective and need to
be replaced. The signs along with the posts shall be maintained in proper position, and kept
clean and legible at
all times. Signs should be cleaned at intervals appropriate to the site
conditions. Signs at locations where they are subject to heavy soiling from passing traffic, or
algae growth (a common problem with signs beneath tree canopies) will need more frequent
cleaning.
12.2
A reference number along with the month and year of installation should be placed
on the back of a sign in a contrasting colour or by stamping
in characters not exceeding 50
mm in height.
It is distracting and unsightly to place reference numbers on the sign face or on
the front of a backing board.
12.3
All signs shall be inspected at least twice a year both in day and night times and at
least once a year in the rain. All signs should be replaced at the end of the warranty period
provided for the retro-reflective sheeting used on the sign. Damaged signs shall be replaced
immediately.
12.4
The authorities responsible for road signs should maintain a schedule of painting
of the posts and signs
periodically.
It
is recommended that painting of the signs (where
applicable) may be undertaken after every two years.
In case of overhead signs, adequate
23



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
provision is to be made to have access to the signs for the purpose of maintenance activities.
This must be ensured
at the time of installation. Special care shall be taken to see that
weeds, shrubbery, mud, etc. are not allowed to obscure any sign.
13 DEFINITION PLATES/SUPPLEMENTARY PLATES
Where the competent authority considers
it advisable to make the meaning of a sign or
symbol more explicit, or
in the case of mandatory signs to
limit their application to certain
categories of road users or to specific periods, an inscription shall be placed below the sign in
a rectangular definition plate of suitable size. The definition plate shall be with retro-reflective
white background and black letters and black border 20 mm wide. Numerals shall be inscribed
in international form of Indian numerals and word messages shall be in English and/or other
languages as necessary. To contain the size of the sign, the number of languages on the
signs shall normally be limited to two. An example of definition plate is given in Plate-
II (Fig.
15.42 + Supplementary plate) and
its design
in Plate
III (Fig. 16.17).
14 MANDATORY/REGULATORY SIGNS
14=1
The detailed dimensioned drawings of normal sized sign and symbols thereon are
shown
in
Plate-I
for ease of reproduction. For signs of other sizes, the symbols should
be
proportionately
reduced
or
enlarged. The
mandatory/regulatory
signs
are
listed
in
Annexure -I. These are classified under the following sub-heads keeping in view their design
and application:
i)
"Stop" and "Give Way" signs (Right of way signs)
ii)

It
is essential that drivers and other road users have an unobstructed view of road
signs. The distance which should be kept clear of obstructions to the sight
line, whether
caused by vegetation (e.g. bushes, trees), other signs or street furniture (e.g. crash barriers),
is known as the clear visibility distance. The higher the prevailing traffic speeds, the greater
this distance needs to be.
1 4.3
Regulatory signs that indicate the beginning of a restriction or prohibition and to which
direction
it applies have to be placed
in accordance with that direction. The requirement
is
that the signs must be placed on each side of the road or on each side of the appropriate
carriageway of a dual carriageway road; except that signs need only be placed on one side
if any of the following circumstances apply:
24



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
i)
Where the restriction, requirement or prohibition applies only to one side of
the road.
ii)
At a junction where traffic turns from a one-way road into the relevant road.
The sign should be angled to face towards the driver.
iii)
At a junction where the carriageway of the relevant road
is less than 5 m
wide and the centre of the sign
is no more than 2 m from the edge of the
carriageway.
14.4
Mandatory and regulatory signs are normally sited at or near the point where the
instruction applies. Table 11.1 (Column 4) specifies minimum clear visibility distances for
regulatory and mandatory signs. These should normally be measured from the center of most
disadvantaged driving lanes. The more the number of signs which drivers are presented with
simultaneously, the greater the difficulty they are likely to have in assimilating the information.
Generally, not more than two signs should be erected on any one post when intended to
be read from an approaching vehicle and this applies when signs are mounted at the same
location on separate posts. Speed limit signs should be mounted alone. When a sign needs
supplementary plate, the combination of sign and plate may be regarded as one sign.
14.5
STOP Sign
14.5.1
Purpose
This
is for indicating priority for the right of way. The sign
is intended for use on roadways
where traffic is required to stop before entering a major road, and where
it is intended that the
vehicle shall proceed past the stop line only after ascertaining that this will not cause danger
to traffic on the main road. This
is a Mandatory/Regulatory sign. (Fig. 14.01)
14.5.2
Combination with markings
The stop sign shall always be used in combination with certain road markings, such as stop
line and the word "STOP" marked on the pavement vide IRC: 35 "Code of Practice for Road
Markings".
14.5.3
Size, shape and colour
The sign (shown
in Fig. 14.01) shall be octagonal
in shape and shall have red background
and white
border. The word "STOP" written
in white
(in
English
or
local language) with
150 mm height letters, centrally positioned. The height of the octagon and border shall be as
per Table 14.1.

Warrants for installation
The sign should be used on a minor road at its intersection with a major road where conditions
are considered to be unduly hazardous due to restricted
visibility, bad alignment and high
accident record. Generally,
if the visibility funnel shown
in Fig. 14.1
is not obstruction free,
the stop sign shall be installed.

sign when used. The sign
shall
not be
used at intersection where traffic signals
are installed.
14.6
GIVE WAY Sign
14.6.1
Purpose
The GIVE WAY sign
is used to assign right-of-way
to
traffic on certain roadways at inter-sections, the
intention
being
that the vehicles
controlled by the
sign must give way
i.e.
yield to other traffic having
the
right
of way.
Vehicles
controlled
by
this
sign
need to slow down or stop when necessary to avoid
interfering with conflicting traffic. This is a Mandatory/
Regulatory sign (Fig. 14.3).
14.6.2
Size, shape and colour
The sign shall be an equilateral triangle with the apex downwards.
It shall have red border
and white background. The sizes and dimensions of these signs shall be as prescribed
in
(Table 14.3).

to assign right-of-way to the major road but where a stop
is not necessary at all times. The
sign shall also be used on
hill roads with single or intermediate lane carriageway on long
gradients facing the downhill
traffic to assign right-of-way to vehicles climbing
uphill. The
GIVE WAY sign, together with
its associated road markings, may also be used as follows:
i)
In
non-urban areas
at
all junctions
of minor roads
with main highway
(National Highway or a State Highway)
ii)
In urban areas generally at junctions of minor road with trunk and principal
road.
If the minor road is a residential or local street,
it is advisable to provide
a STOP sign.
iii)
At other junctions and roundabouts where the
traffic regulatory authority
considers
it desirable on account of traffic speeds or volumes
The visibility funnel already depicted
in Fig. 14.1
shall be obstruction free while installing a
give way sign.
14.6.4
Location
The
sign
shall be
located
in advance
to the
point where vehicles are
required
to stop
or to slow down
to yield the
right-of-way, say at a distance of 1.5 m
to 12 m.
It
is also
recommended
that Give Way
line
(Ref.
IRC:
35) should be marked
at the entry to the
junction. Give Way line may be preceded by GIVE WAY marking on the road as shown
in
Fig.
14.3. On gradients, the sign should be placed
at the start of the down gradient and
repeated as necessary.
14.6.5
Give way to buses exiting bus lay-by ahead
The sign shall be used to inform the vehicles about Give Way to Buses exiting from a bus
lay-by ahead. The sign shall be placed at the beginning of such area (Fig. 14.03).
14.7
Prohibitory Signs
These
signs
generally
give
instructions
regarding
maneuver
that must
not be
made.
Prohibitory signs indicate a forbidden maneuver. They cover both junctions and the sections
of road between junctions.
14.7.1
Size, shape and colour
The signs shall be of circular shape with a red border, white background, and black symbol.
The sizes and dimensions of mandatory signs are given at Table 14.4 and also of regulatory
signs.
14.7.2
Bullock Carts Prohibited
The sign shall be erected on each entry to the road where bullock carts are to be prohibited
(Fig. 14.04).

The signs shall be located at places where the vehicles are not allowed to enter.
It is generally
erected
at the end of one-way road
to prohibit
traffic entering the roadway
in the wrong
direction and also at each intersection along the one-way road. The No Entry sign,
if used,
should be placed directly in view of a road user at the point where a road user could wrongly
enter. The sign should be mounted on the
left side of the roadway, facing traffic that might
enter the roadway or ramp in the wrong direction.
If the No Entry sign would be visible to traffic
to which
it does not apply, the sign should be turned away from, or shielded from, the view of that
traffic. The sign may be repeated on long stretches
if considered necessary (Fig. 14.19).

======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
The scope of the prohibition may be explained by inscriptions on the definition plate specifying
as the case may be
In addition, the definition plate may exhibit a single-headed arrow pointing the direction
in
which the restriction is applicable
if the sign is at the end of a zone, or a double-headed arrow
pointing both ways
if the sign is at an intermediate point in the zone.
14.8.3
Location of 'NO STANDING' Sign
This sign (Fig. 14.27) shall be erected where the controlling authority has decided to prohibit
standing of vehicle even for a very short duration. The sign should be accompanied by suitable
kerb or carriageway markings as indicated
in IRC: 35. A definition plate can be attached to
sign post to convey the message more precisely.
14.8.4
Location of "NO STOPPING' and 'NO STANDING" Sign
The sign (Fig. 14.28) shall be erected on sections of a road or street where the controlling
authority has decided to prohibit stopping of vehicles and standing and even momentary
stopping. Adefinition plate can be attached to sign post to convey the message more precisely.
14.8.5
No Parking Signs in Urban Area
In urban areas, the "No Parking" sign is used on the roads to prevent any parking of vehicles
on the main carriageway which
will lead to congestion. This sign may be used along with
time restriction, indicating morning and evening peak periods. The sign shall be placed at the
start of the zone
till the end of the prohibition zone. Signs should be erected within 25 m of
the start and end of the prohibition. The "No Parking" sign is placed parallel to kerb facing the
carriageway and sited approximately at 100 m intervals. Where signs are used without road
markings, they should be placed strategically rather than at fixed intervals. The aim should
be that wherever drivers might be tempted to stop, they should be able to see a sign. The
spacing between consecutive signs, whether or not they are on the same side of the road,
should be not more than 30 m. The sign can be accompanied by arrow showing the direction,
timings can be changed and date can be added where required.
A "No Parking" sign should be introduced only where there are no other on-street parking
controls, even
if they operate at different times of day. Where other controls are required, the
"No Parking" sign should be replaced by a prohibition of waiting and loading sign provided
accordingly (Fig. 14.29).

Compulsory Direction Control and Other Signs
14.11.1
Size, Shape and Colour
These signs shall be circular in shape with blue background and white border (2 mm), and
having symbols in white. The size shall be as per the dimensions given in Table 14.3.
14.11 .2
Compulsory Ahead
, Compulsory Ahead or Turn Right/Left
The signs in Figs. 14.41 to 14.43 indicate the routes that are lawfully to be taken and direction
of movement with respect to the position of sign installed.
1 4.1 1 .3
Compulsory Turn Right/Left
The signs in Fig. 14.44 and Fig. 14.45 indicate the routes that are lawfully to be taken and
direction of movement with respect to the position of sign installed. Fig. 14.47 should be used
on Central Island of a roundabout to be seen by drivers' on the approach road.
Where compulsory turn
left or right sign
is installed
in advance of junction approximately
50 m ahead, signs as Fig. 14.47 or Fig. 14.48 as appropriate should be used.
1 4. 1 1 .4
Compulsory keep Left/Right
The sign at Fig. 14.48 shows keep left sign which is used at traffic islands, refuges, and at the
beginning of central median of a divided carriageway.
It is used at the recommencement of
central median following a gap, as traffic turns right in front of the sign without actually passing
it. Keep right sign (Fig. 14.49) is used in traffic calming schemes and also in association with
road works. The sizes of 300 mm for Fig. 14.48 and Fig. 14.49 can be considered when
installed on bollards.
14.11.5
Pass Either Side
The "Pass either side" sign as shown
in Fig. 14.50
is for use on
traffic islands, usually
in
one-way roads, where drivers passing either side of the sign reach the same destination
immediately ahead.
It must not be used in situations where drivers would become committed
to different destinations once they had passed the sign.
In this case, a plain-faced bollard or
Two way Hazard Marker (Fig,, 15.78) should normally be provided. Where flag type direction
signs have been erected on the
traffic islands,
it becomes clear without the compulsory
direction sign.
14.11.6
Minimum Speed Limit
Where engineering judgment determines that slow speeds, especially on an expressway,

IRC: 67-2012
might impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, the Minimum Speed
Limit
sign may be installed to indicate the minimum legal speed (Fig. 14.51). This shall be used
on specific sections to avoid the slow moving vehicles to improve the efficiency of the traffic
movement.
It
is compulsory to install the "Restriction End" sign at the end of the minimum
speed limit sign when restriction of minimum speed
is applied for a section of the road.
13.11.7
Compulsory Cycle Track/Cycles Only
The sign shall notify cyclists that they must use the cycle track at the entrance to which
it is
placed, and shall notify the drivers of other vehicles that they are not entitled to use that track
(Fig. 14.52).
14.11.8
Compulsory Cyclist and Pedestrian Route
The sign shall be used to segregate cycle and pedestrian lanes (Fig. 14.53).
1 4.1 1 .9
Pedestrians only
The sign shall mean that only pedestrians are allowed and the traffic
is not allowed on this
road/carriageway. The sign may be supported by supplementary plate with 'PEDESTRIANS
ONLY' written on
it (Fig. 14.54).
14.11.10 Compulsory Snow Chain

shall be used
in
hilly areas
for compulsory use of snow chain on
all vehicles
(Fig.14.55).
14.11.11 Bus Way/Buses only
The sign shall mean that only buses are allowed and the other traffic
is not allowed on this
road/carriageway. The sign may be supported by supplementary plate with 'BUSES ONLY'
written on

Location and Mounting
Warning signs should not be mounted on the same post as a STOP or GIVE WAY or speed
limit sign, nor mounted on a traffic signal post. When mounted with other types of sign, the
triangular warning signs should always be mounted at the top. Where two or more warning
signs are erected together, the sign relating to the hazard first encountered should be placed
uppermost. When a new sign
is added to an existing post,
it is important to ensure that the
correct order
is maintained,
if necessary adjusting the position of the existing signs. The
warning signs should normally be located depending upon 85
th percentile speed of private
cars (as given
in Table 15.1)
in advance of the hazard warned against. Distances may be
increased on steep downhill gradients to account for higher speed. Where map type advance
direction signs are posted in advance of the intersections, the warning signs relating to these
junctions could be avoided to eliminate the clustering of signs.
15.4
Left/Right Curve
These signs are to be used, whenever there is a need for reduction of speed due to change of
direction of alignment and radii of the curvature are below the specified limit. These signs are
intended to warn the driver to reduce the speed and proceed cautiously. The warning signs are
to be used sparingly.
If a road has certain curves where vehicles cannot be allowed to negotiate
with the absolute speed
limit or the general operating speed established for the road, such
curves shall be provided with curve warning signs on both approaches. Supplementary plate
indicating advisory speed limit can also be provided along with cautionary sign considering
the level of restriction required on the curve.
Ideally
if the difference between the approach
speed to a curve and the safe negotiating speed derived based on geometric parameters of
curve exceeds 15 kmph, the curve shall be provided with curve warning sign.
The left hand curve sign should be used to mark curves bending to the left and the right hand
curve sign for curves bending to the right (Figs. 15.01 and 15.02).
15.5
Right/Left Hairpin Bend
The sign should be used to mark curves of small
radii, where the change of direction
is so
37



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
considerable as to amount to a reversal of direction. The symbol should bend to left or right
according to the road alignment (Figs. 15.03 and 15.04).
1 5.6
Right/Left Reverse Bend
The sign should be erected where two curves in opposite direction are separated by a tangent
less than 120 m
in length
in plains and 30 m
in
hills. The sign may also be erected where
in the opinion of the controlling authority; the nature of the reverse bend
is not obvious to
approaching drivers and constitutes a hazard.
If the first curve is to the right, a right reverse
bend sign shall be used.
If the first curve is to the left, a left reverse bend sign shall be used
(Figs. 15.05 and 15.06).
15.7
Series of Bends
This sign should be used to caution the driver of the presence of zig-zag for a long distance
over the section of road ahead. The sign may be posted 50-100 m ahead of the section
under question. The sign may be repeated at appropriate intervals
if the zig-zag road
is long
(Fig. 15.07).
15.8
270 Degree Loop
The sign shall be used to caution the vehicles about 270 degree sharp loop. The sign shall
be placed at the beginning of such area (Fig. 15.08).
15.9
Side Road
The sign should be erected (Figs. 15.09 and 15.10) in advance of the main road intersections
where in the opinion of the controlling authority, a sufficiently large volume of entering traffic
together with restricted sight distance
is likely to constitute a hazard. The sign should only
be used when the drivers need to be warned of the existence of a junction and no other
indication, e.g., by a map type advance direction sign or traffic signal
is given.
15.10
Y-lntersection
The sign should be erected on the approach to a bifurcation of any road. This sign should
only be used when the driver needs to be warned of the existence of a junction and no other
indication, e. g., by a map type advance direction sign or traffic signal,
is given (Figs. 15.11
to 15.13).
15.11
Cross Road
The sign should be erected in advance of the cross road where in the opinion of the controlling
authority, a sufficiently large volume of crossing or entering
traffic together with restricted
sight distance is likely to constitute a hazard. This sign should only be used when the drivers
need to be warned of the existence of an intersection and no other indication,
e.g., by an
advance direction sign or traffic signal,
is given (Fig. 15.14).

The sign should be erected
in advance of T-junctions where in the opinion of the controlling
authority, the nature of the intersection
is not obvious to approaching drivers. The width of
bands should indicate the relative importance of the roads. This sign should only be used
when the driver needs to be warned of the existence of a junction and no other indication,
e.g., by a map type advance direction sign or traffic signal,
is given (Fig. 15.17 and 15.18).
15.15
Major Road Ahead
The sign should be erected
in advance of crossing with a major road, where

16 INFORMATORY SIGNS
16.1
The signs illustrated
in this section give information to the road user regarding their
location or facilities available in the vicinity or about the destination. The detailed dimensioned
drawings for direction information signs with guidance for design are shown
in Plate-Ill and
design
principles are presented
in Annexure-lll. For facility information signs for normal
sizes are shown
in Plate-IV and signs of other sizes the symbols should be proportionately
reduced or enlarged. The facility information signs are listed in Annexure-IV.
16.2
The signs are classified under the following sub-heads keeping
in view their design
and application:
1)
Direction and Place Identification signs
2)
Facility Information signs
3)
Other Useful Information Signs
4)
Parking Signs, and
5)
Flood Gauge
16.3
Direction and Place Identification Signs
Following are the functions of the direction signs:
•
It should give drivers advance information of their approach to a junction
It should indicate the type of junction
It should inform them of the destinations that may be reached from each exit
•
It should identify the route and indicate its status within network
1 6.3.1
Shape, Colour and Language of Inscription
These signs shall be rectangular. However direction signs may be in the shape of an elongated
rectangle with the longer side horizontal, terminating in an arrowhead. The colour pattern for
direction signs are given in Table 8.3 and size of the letters shall be as per Table 11.1. The
English font shall be "Transport Medium" and Hindi shall be "Hindi7". The design principles
are presented pictorially in Figs. 16.01 to 16.16. All messages, borders, and legends shall be
retro-reflective and all background shall be retro-reflective or illuminated.
16.3.2
Advance Direction Signs
The sign indicates the routes ahead by showing the names of particular places with arrow
46



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
symbols indicating directions.
If desired, distance of places
in km may be shown after the
destination names.
If more than one place is to be shown in the same direction, the names of
the places may be grouped and a single arrow used for direction indication. Names/ Group
of names of places shall be separated by a line as shown
in Fig. 16.01. These are called
as stack type sign. On high speed roads where the junctions are complex
in layout, large
size signs (map type signs) shown in Fig. 16.02 may be employed.
In situation where rotary
(roundabout) inter-section exists, signs as shown in Fig. 16.03 may be employed. The signs
can be either shoulder mounted or gantry mounted. Gantry mounted signs are generally
used for grade separated intersections. The sign shall normally be located at a distance from
the intersection as given in Table 11.1.
The Advance Direction Signs shall be for showing directions and destinations with arrows,
and whenever applicable can be with route numbers also.
16.3.2.1 Advance Direction Signs
•
Map type
of sign
is designed based on
the junction
configuration and
geometry. However
it can be modified
in terms of shape and composition
for increasing the clarity and aesthetics.
•
In a roundabout junction sign, the recommended minimum angle for cut-out
is 25°. The purpose of the cut-out is to emphasize that all traffic must travel
in a clockwise direction.
•
Where a roundabout
is offset from the main direction of travel,
it may be
appropriate to show a curved approach arm on the advanced direction sign.
16.3.2.2
Siting ofAdvance Direction Signs
Junction Reference point: The distance
in advance of junction at which Advance Direction
signs should be sited
is measured from the junction reference point. The reference point is
defined below.
In case of Interchange, the point at which carriageway widens to form the exit road and for
at-grade Junctions from:
•
STOP or Give Way line
•
The point at which the carriageway first widens to form additional turning
lanes or slip roads.
16.3.2.3
Siting ofAdvance Direction Signs for Interchanges
The standard distances
at which Advance
Direction
sign would be
sited
are shown
in
Table 11.1. This shall be applicable for expressways or highways with major interchanges.
However,
if the distance between two successive junctions
is less than
1 km which
is a
common phenomenon in most of the urban areas in the country, only Advance Direction sign
shall be used.

PAGE 58 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
For grade separated intersections,
(i.e. where the traffic movement occurs on two or more
than two levels), two advanced direction signs should be provided. The first Advance Direction
sign
is located 750 m to 1.5 km from the exit, which should be preferably gantry mounted
sign. The second advance direction sign is located 250 m to 750 m from the exit.
It should be
gantry mounted; but at intersections where the number of through lanes remains constant,
it may be shoulder mounted. Additionally a map type and stack type direction sign can be
installed at 100m to 250m ahead of exit (Fig. 16.14).
16.3.2.4
Stack Type Advance Direction Sign
•
Stack type signs are intended for use only at simple junctions and should not
indicate more than three directions as the sign would then become difficult
to read
o
Both the arrow and the panel are centered vertically on the sign
o
Arrows may be vertical or horizontal or at any angle (increments of 22.5°)
When more than one destination is shown, following should be considered:
o
Destination ahead with vertical arrow on right hand side of destination name
and both right aligned
o
Destination to the left with the arrow on the left of the destination name and
both left aligned
o
Destination to the right with the arrow on the right of the destination name
and
both right aligned
1 6. 3. 2. 5

is
indicated by the arrowhead at the end of the sign board, the board being placed generally
parallel to the road leading to the place named. These types of sign are called as Flag type
signs. The placement of the direction sign
shall be as per the provisions of Table
11.1.
It should be
visible to the drivers both during approach and while making the turn
(with
minimum clear visibility distance). This design principle may also be used for signs indicating

21 GUIDELINES FOR SIGNS ON EXPRESSWAYS
An expressway is a divided highway for high speed traffic with full control of access.
21.1
General
The signing system for expressways should help road user to get clear and progressive
direction information to avoid possible inconvenience by missing proper entry or exit. Apart
from the direction information signs, alignment delineation signing and hazard adjacent to
high speed
traffic are important while considering signing for expressway. The Vulnerable
Road Users like pedestrians and cyclist are not present and the signs catering their need are
not required in the main alignment.
Signs are designed so that they are legible to road users approaching them and can be read
in time to permit proper responses. Desired design characteristics include: (a) long visibility
distances, (b) large lettering and symbols, and (c) short legends for quick comprehension.
2.1.2
Colour of Signs
The colour of
ail type of signs except direction informatory sign shall be same as that of
Plate-I, and Plate-ll whereas for direction information signs,
it shall be white lettering, border
and arrows on blue background.
In case of facility signs, black symbol
is displayed within
white square in blue background.
21.3
Format of Legends on Overhead and Shoulder Mounted Signs
The legend on
all signboards
shall
be
bilingual-regional/local language and
english
except on those signboards located at entry and/exit points of Expressways. Entry/Exit
shall have inscriptions
in regional/local language, Hindi and English. The font type shall
be as per Table 21.1 and a typical expressway ahead sign
is given in Fig. 16.15.

Size of Letters
Size of letters should be as per Table 11.1. Normally, sign size is determined by the length of
the message and size of the letters necessary for proper legibility. For supplementary plates
attached with facility signs, regulatory signs or cautionary signs the recommended letter size
is
1 00 mm. The text size of 1 00-1 25 mm letter size shall be used in the supplementary plates
with some of the regulatory signs depicting information on typical timings like "09:00 am to

General guidelines given
in Sections
1 to 20 as relevant for informatory signs shall apply
except for the following signs.
21.8.1
Direction Signs
The direction signs should be either gantry or shoulder mounted. These signs shall be used
for grade separated Entry and Exit to the expressways. Advance direction signs should be
placed normally at
1 km and at 2 km in advance of the exit.
21 .8.2
Exit Direction Signs
The exit direction sign repeats the route and destination information that was shown on
the advance information sign(s) for the next
exit, and thereby assures road users of the
destination served and indicates whether they exit to the
left or right for that destination.
Shoulder mounted Exit Direction signs should be installed at the beginning of the deceleration
lane.
If there is less than 90 m from the beginning of the deceleration lane, the Exit Direction
sign should be installed overhead over the exiting lane.
21.8.3
Distance Signs
Distances
to the same destinations should be shown
at 5 km
intervals. The distances
displayed on these signs should be the actual distance to the destination points and not the
distance to the exit from the expressway.
22 GUIDELINES FOR SIGNS ON URBAN AND CITY ROADS
22.1
General
The signing system for urban and city roads should help road user to get clear and unambiguous
information where there could be many advertisement hoardings and road side activities.
The Vulnerable Road Users like pedestrians and cyclists and signs for disabled people would
play important role in urban and city road signing.
Signs are designed so that they are legible to road users approaching them and can be read
in time to permit proper responses. Desired design characteristics include: (a) long visibility
distances, (b) large lettering and symbols, and (c) short legends for quick comprehension.
Colour of Signs

23 SIGN PLAN EXAMPLES FOR TYPICAL SITUATIONS
Sign plans for some typical situations are presented
in Annexure V, Figure V.1
to Figure
V.10. A list of the typical conditions wherein the posting of different Sign Plans can be adopted
is given below (typical figures presented
in Annexure V). However, the sign plan shown
in
these figures are indicative only, and are not the only signs to be used
in such road layouts.
To cater to the specific road environment and road users likely to use these locations, other
signs are also required to be installed. Engineer is required to prepare a
full sign plan and
necessary estimate for implementation.
If required, advice of traffic engineering expert may
be sought before placement for special conditions.

ii) RULES FOR DESIGN OF DIRECTION INFORMATION SIGN
The rules for design of direction information sign given
in following subsections shall be
read
in conjunction with the pictorial presentation
in Plate
III and
all direction boards shall
be designed accordingly.
It should be noted that Plate
III has not been shown in colour since
colour pattern for different kind of roads varies and the colour pattern shall be taken from Table 8.3.
1) Alphabets
The "Transport Medium" font shall be used for English and "Hindi7" for Hindi and for regional
language
it shall be as per local practice. The arrows for directions boards shall also be taken
117



======================================================================
PAGE 128 of 152
======================================================================
IRC: 67-2012
from "Transport Medium" font. The height of lettering for design of direction sign shall be
taken from Table 11.1 for the speed of the road in which the sign is to be placed.
2) Common Principles for design of layouts for Direction Signs
The common
principles
to be observed
while designing
shoulder and
gantry mounted
direction signs are given in the subsection below and the specific principles for different type
of direction board are given under respective subsections. The common principles for design
of direction boards (Figs. 16.01 to 16.16) are:
The height mentioned in Table 11.1 refers to the height of lower case "x" and
upper case shall be
1 .4 times of lower case "x" height.
The design pattern shown
in Figs. 16.01 to 16.16 expressed the design of
layout of direction sign in terms of stroke width and "x" height. Stroke width
(s/x) shall be % of lower case "x" height.
All place names on a sign shall be
in letters of the same size, regardless
of the relative importance of the place name. A smaller letter size may only
be used for a name which
is too long to
fit into a reasonable sized sign and
which cannot be hyphenated or abbreviated.
Letters are generally placed in an imaginary tile of 2 times "x" height i.e. 8 s/w
height and the placement of English lettering
is pictorially presented
in Fig.
16.01 whereas as Hindi lettering shall be placed within 2 times "x" height i.e.
within
8 s/w height.
Related words on the same line shall be separated by VA s/w.
Route letters and route number shall be separated by
1
1/2 s/w.
Route letters shall be 2 s/w away place name when on same line.
There shall be 3 s/w spaces between a route number and a bracketed route
number on same line.
The border shall be
1 V2 s/w wide.
Internal corner radius of outer border shall be 2 s/w and other internal radius
shall be
1 s/w.
Within
panel, the borders
shall be separated from the top and sides
of
imaginary tile by 2
1/2 s/w and on bottom by VA s/w.
In addition to the common principles laid out in this section, the specific principles for design
of different types of signs are given in following sections:

Annexure VI
DETERMINATION OF "X" HEIGHT FOR DIRECTION SIGNS (SHOULDER &
GANTRY MOUNTED)
From the diagrams, "C"
is the distance from the sign
where a driver is expected to stop reading the sign
.i.e.
the point where a driver would turn his head through
10° or more.
i.e. C = S x cotangent 10° = S x 5.7
"S" is the off-set distance from the centre of the driving
lane to the centre of the sign. This
is measured from
the
centre
of
the
right-hand-most
lane
on
a
dual
carriageway.
"R"
is the distance travelled while reading the sign.
Distance (R) = Reading Time x Speed
Reading time = 2 +
(N/3) seconds; where N
is the
number of words or destinations on the sign. When
N equals 6 the reading time
is taken as 4 seconds.
It
allows driver to scan the sign twice to assimilate the
information. The sign may be obscured for part of the
time by
virtue
of other vehicles and
the
driver
still needs
to pay
attention
to the
road ahead.

Table VI. 1 Shoulder Mounted ADS
The x-height of the sign depends on the
distance of the driver from the sign when he
starts to read
it.
It is taken that, on average
at a distance of 60 meters,
the x height
should be 100 mm and proportionately at
30 metres, the x-height would be 50 mm.
From the first principle, the "x" heights have
been determined for various categories of
Indian roads, which are given in Table VI.
to VI.3.
