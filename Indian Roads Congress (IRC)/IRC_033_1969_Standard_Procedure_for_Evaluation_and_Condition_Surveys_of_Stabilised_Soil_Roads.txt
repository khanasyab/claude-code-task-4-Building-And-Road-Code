Standard  Procedure  For  Evaluation  
And  Condition  Surveys  Of  
Stabilised  Soil  Roads
1.  Introduction
1.1	
The Standard Procedure for Evaluation and Condition 
Surveys of Stabilised Soil Roads was approved by the Stabilised 
Soil Roads Committee (personal given below). This was later 
considered by the Executive Committee in their meeting held on 
the 24th March, 1962 and later it was circulated to the members 
of the Council on the 10th August, 1962. The comments of the 
members of the Council were considered by the Stabilised Soil 
Roads Committee in their meeting held on the 1st  October, 1967 
and later in their meeting held from the 19th to the 21st September, 
1968. This was then placed before the Executive Committee in 
their meeting held on the 13th March, 1969 and it was approved 
by the council in their 71st Council meeting held at Bhubaneswar 
on the 26th and 27th May, 1969 for being published as the finalised 
standard of the Indian Roads Congress.

1.2	
There 
is 
real 
need 
for 
adopting 
a 
standard 
procedure for evaluating the condition and performance of 
stabilised soil roads. The approach to the rating or evaluation 
of a pavement may be deemed a negative one, in as much as 
it deals with the amount of destruction or the amount of failure 
that has taken place since its construction. In the case of a 
pavement, it is rather difficult to define precisely, what exactly 
constitutes its “failure”. The term unfortunately has come to 
signify all things to all men and there is a prevalent tendency 
to use it to describe all manners of phenomena, some of which 
are not failures at all, but merely evidence of some condition 
which makes the pavement less than perfect. Any reasonable 
definition of failure of a pavement will have to take into account 
a stated amount of maintenance, because maintenance is a 
necessary feature in any type of failure. This will naturally entail 
deciding what should be an acceptable amount of maintenance. 
It is felt that this is a matter on which a general agreement would 
be rather difficult. In the circumstances, for the purposes of this 
standard, the term “failure” is applied somewhat loosely to an 
unsatisfactory condition in the pavement which is of sufficient 
severity to warrant attention.
1.3	
Failures of flexible pavements may be grouped under 
three distinct heads depending on the primary cause or source 
of the trouble. In the first group are included the types of failure 
or unsatisfactory performance that are attributable solely to the 
quality of the surfacing itself. The second group represents a 
type of failure which may manifest itself in many forms, but in 
effect indicates slip-page caused by lack of bond between the 
surfacing and the under-lying layer. In the third group are failures 
which are attributable to the deficiencies of the base, sub-base 
or subgrade.
1.4	
In the evaluation of a pavement which show signs of 
distress or which does not satisfactorily perform the function for 
which it is intended, as a first step, it is intended, as a first step, 
it is important to determine the group to which the type of failure 
belongs or, in other words, to determine the component of the

pavement in which the distress has occurred. In the following 
paragraphs, an attempt has been made to enumerate in brief the 
basic types of failures of flexible pavements, and approximate 
means of their identification.
2.  Deficiencies  of  Surfacing
These would normally be noticed in the form of scaling, stripping, 
ravelling, disintegration, cracking and instability (or plastic 
distortion) of the road surface which may develop irrespective of 
the foundation support. Ravelling can be caused by low bitumen 
content, improper coating of aggregate, inadequate compaction. 
It may develop into pot-holing which may sometimes be attributed, 
by mistake, to failure in the lower layers of the pavement.
3.  Slippage  Due to Lack  of  Bond  
With  The  Base
When the surfacing is not adequately keyed with the base, 
slippage will occur. This condition has often been noticed when 
the surface of the stabilised soil base is exceedingly dusty or not 
properly primed before the application of the wearing course. 
Slippage can also cause ravelling of the surface and subsequent 
poor riding qualities.
4.  Deficiencies  Of  Underlying  Layers
Pavement defects falling in this category may be caused by 
(a) inadequate thickness of sub-base and base, and 
(b) inadequate compaction of subgrade, sub-base, and base. 
These are dealt with separately hereunder:
4.1	
Thickness
The thickness of sub-base, base and surfacing above a given 
layer is considered inadequate, if detectable shear deformation 
occurs in that layer. Shear deformation, which is also referred to 
as plastic movement or plastic deformation, may be defined as 
change in shape with no change in volume. During traffic, materials

move out from under wheel paths, creating a depression in the 
traffic lane and an upheaval outside the traffic lane. Incidentally, 
it may be mentioned that the thicknesses shown in the standard 
CBR design charts are intended to prevent all shear deformation 
in the layer with the given CBR.
Determination of the occurrence of shear deformation in 
a particular layer can be made by a study of (i) deflection 
measurement, (ii) in-place strength tests, (iii) cracking of the 
pavement, (iv) upheaval of the surface, and (v) position of the 
layers.
(i) 
Deflection
	
Deflection in the downward movement under load. 
Deflections at the level being considered (e.g. 
the subgrade) are measured in accelerated traffic 
tests under standing loads at intervals throughout the 
period of the test. Surface deflections can also be used, 
if the overlying layers are of high quality and adequately 
compacted, so that little compression occurs under 
load. Curves of deflections versus coverage (on a semi-
logarithmic chart) are of important value in determining 
whether shear deformation is taking place. Curves 
which show a decreasing or constant deflection with 
coverage are typical of conditions where there is no 
shear deformation.
(ii) 
In-place Strength Tests
	
In-place CBR and other strength tests can also be used 
to indicate the development of shear deformation in any 
layer, if the tests are made at intervals. Where no shear 
deformation occurs, the CBR value will remain constant 
or increase with the traffic, where shear deformation is 
taking place, there will be a significant drop in the CBR 
value.
(iii) 
Cracking
	
The cracking that develops in a bituminous pavement, 
when shear deformation occurs, follows a typical pattern.

In the early stages, the cracks are generally parallel 
to the direction of traffic. As repetitions are continued, 
transverse cracks are formed and an alligator pattern 
is developed. Closely spaced cracking indicates shear 
deformation in a layer near the surface, widely spaced 
cracking indicates shear deformation in a deep layer.
(iv)	
Upheaval
	
Upheaval of the surface adjacent to the traffic lane is 
definite evidence of shear deformation. The width of a 
rut indicates in a general way the depth of the railed 
layer. This should not be taken as rigid rule, but only 
as a criterion with some reservations. Subgrade shear 
failures will exhibit surface upheaval at some distance 
from the depressed rut, whereas shear failures in the 
surface will result in upheavals relatively close to the 
tyre track.
(v) 
Position of Layers
	
A cross-section of the face of trench, cut across the 
traffic lane, can show whether or not a layer has been 
overstressed to the point where shear deformation has 
occurred. A thinning of the concerned layer in the traffic 
lane, accompanied by its thickening outside the traffic 
lane, is evidence of shear deformation in the layer. Also 
upheaval of the subgrade outside the traffic lane is 
evidence of shear deformation in the subgrade.
4.2 
Compaction
Compaction is defined as a change in shape accompanied by 
a change in volume, as opposed to shear deformation where 
no change in volume occurs. The compaction of the pavement 
is caused by repetitive and vibratory movements of traffic and 
results in a depression beneath the wheel path. The shape of the 
depression is a clue to the layer that has densified. Compaction 
in a layer near the surface will produce a sharp depression; 
compaction at a depth will cause a broader depression.

5.  General
5.1	
It may be stressed that although the causes of pavement 
distress have been neatly separated in the preceding paragraphs, 
in practice it will never be the case. When distress occurs in a 
pavement, both  compaction and shear deformation are involved, 
an it is necessary to try to separate the two. Compaction, though 
contributing to undesirable surface irregularity, increases the 
structural strength of a pavement and becomes successively 
reduced under given intensity of traffic. Shear deformation, on 
the other hand, becomes progressively more pronounced in its 
resultant effects.
5.2	
These points have been set down here at some length 
to serve for guidance in the preliminary evaluation of stabilised 
soil pavements.
5.3	
The condition survey should give a qualitative as well 
as a quantitative appraisal of the defects in the pavement. The 
qualitative study will involve rating of the defects according to 
their severity, the quantitative approach will take into account 
the extent of the distress and relate it to the total area of the 
pavement.
5.4	
In addition, for a proper condition survey, the authorities 
concerned should give detailed data regarding cost of 
maintenance of the stabilized soil roads in service. The average 
traffic volume per day of commercial vehicles, passenger cars an 
bullock carts should also be included in the data. The information 
in Tables 1 an 2 should be recorded in the manner indicated 
below.

the field just before the commencement of rolling and
