GUIDELINES FOR TRAFFIC
PREDICTION ON
RURAL HIGHWAYS
1.1.
The need for preparing draft "Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural
Highways" was suggested by the Traffic Engineering Committee in
its meeting
held on 30th September, 1994.
The draft was prepared by Dr. L.R. Kadiyali and was discussed by the
Traffic Engineering Committee in its meeting held on 31st August, 1995 when it
was felt that the draft may be reviewed and revised in view of the comments of
the members.
The
Traffic Engineering Committee
(Personnel given below)
in
its
meeting held on 29th January, 1996 approved the draft "Guidelines for Traffic
Prediction on Rural Highways"

The guidelines were approved by
the Highways
Specifications &
Standards Committee and the Executive Committee in their meetings held on 19th
March and 17th April, 1996.
The guidelines were considered by
the Council in their meeting held on
24th May, 1996
when it was decided that the draft be modified in the light of the
comments of the members and then be considered by the Executive Committee.
The draft was finally approved by the Executive Committee in its meeting held on
4th September, 1996.
1.2.
An estimation of future traffic on Rural Highways is required for a variety
of purposes. The width of a pavement is decided on the basis of the traffic volume
it can efficiently accommodate. A pavement needs to be widened when the traffic
flow exceeds
its capacity. Pavements are designed on the basis of volume of
commercial
vehicles using
the
facility, and more importantly
the number of
repetitions of standards axle loads during the design period. The manner in which
pavements perform and deteriorate
is governed by the volume of commercial
vehicles and the repetitions of standards
axles.- The Economic Analysis of a
highway project relies for its accuracy on the correct
prediction of future traffic
flows and the benefits enjoyed by different types of vehicular traffic from highway
improvements. For a toll project, the stream of cash flow from toll collection is
determined from the traffic that is likely to use the facility and the toll rates. In all
the above situations, the accuracy with which future traffic is predicted is of prime
importance.
The present guidelines are intended for predicting traffic on rural sections
of highways, including intersections. They can not be used for urban situations,
where the prediction is more complicated.
2. ESTABLISHING EXISTING TRAFFIC FLOWS
2. 1
.
Measurement of Traffic Flow
Traffic flow or volume is measured in terms of number of vehicles per
unit time. The common units of time are day and hour. Thus the flows are measured
in terms of vehicles per day or vehicles per hour.
Since Indian traffic is heterogeneous in character,
it is common practice
to convert the
traffic
in terms of passenger car units (PCUs). The values of
passenger car equivalency for different vehicles types are given in IRC :64- 1990,
Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural Areas, and are reproduced in Table
1
for ready reference.

2.2.
Traffic Census Data
Daily
traffic volume
is denoted by
the term ADT or AADT. ADT
(Average Daily Traffic) is the value when traffic counts are taken for a limited
period of say 3-7 days, and the daily average determined. AADT (Annual Average
Daily Traffic) is the value when traffic counts are taken for all the 365 days of the
year and the daily average determined.
According
to the present practice as detailed
in IRC:9-1972, Traffic
Census on Non-urban Roads, a repetitive 7 day count is taken twice every year,
once during the peak season and the other during the lean season. The average of
the peak and lean season census data can be approximately taken as the average
for the year (ADT). If more accurate values are needed, the traffic census data
obtained during a particular month can be used for estimating the average for the
year by applying seasonal factors. Such seasonal correction factors will have to be
arrived at for the particular location on the basis of a round-the-year traffic census.
3. 1
.
Unit of Measurement
Traffic flows at intersections are generally expressed in terms of PCUs
per hour. The values of PCUs should be as given in IRC Special Publication 41
on "Guidelines for the Design of At-grade Intersections in Rural & Urban Areas".
The peak hour traffic is more relevant in the design of intersections than the daily
flow.

3.2.
Directional Census
For
intersection
design
the
directional counts showing
the
turning
movements
will be necessary
to determine
the carriageway width
for each
directions of flow.
4. ESTIMATION OF TRAFFIC GROWTH
4. 1
.
Factors Governing Traffic Growth
Traffic growth is governed by a number of factors such as:
Economic
1.
Gross National Product (GNP) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
2.
Agricultural Output
3.
Industrial Output
Demographic
4.
Population
5.
Rural/Urban mix of population
Since the above economic indicators vary widely across the country,
traffic growth rate varies from State to State, and within a State from region to
region. Traffic growth rate has to be established for each location by giving due
considerations to the above factors.
4.2.
Determination of Past Trends
Past trend of traffic growth is a valuable guide in determining the future
trend. Past trends can be established from a variety of traffic growth indicators
such as:
1.
Traffic flow from census
2.
Vehicle registration
3.
Fuel sales
A comparison of the growth rates for each of the above will be useful.
For establishing reliable growth rates, the data should be for a number of
years. The analysis can then be done for the entire period, and also for blocks of
5 years.

======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 18
======================================================================
IRC:108-1996
The best way to arrive at the rate of growth
is through a regression
analysis. The formula expressing the compound rate of growth of traffic is:
Pn = Po(l+r)
n
Where
Pn
=
Traffic in the nth year
Po
=
Traffic flow in the base year
n
=
number of years
r
=
annual rate of growth of traffic, expressed
in decimals. Taking logs on
both sides,
LogePn = logePo + n logc (1+r)
Y = A 0 + Ai n
Where
Y
=
LogePn, A0 = LogePo and P0 = eAo
Ai
=
Logc (1+r), and (1+r) = eAi
The above equation can be established from a data set of n values.
The following example gives the procedure.
The 10
- year data on
traffic flow at a census point
is given below.

The regression fit obtained from computer or by manual method to the
above data is P = 6228 (1.101)
n
.
Thus
r= 10.1 per cent
4.3.
Extrapolation from Past Trends
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of growth is to assume
the same rate of growth as in the past. This may be all right for short-term projects,
say 5-10 years. But, for long-term projections,
it would be erroneous to assume
that the past rate of growth will prevail for a long time in the future. Economic
conditions are bound to change over a long period, and
it would be necessary to
modify the rate of growth accordingly. Subjective assessments in this regard will
have to be cautiously done.
4.4.
Econometric Models
If the past data
is available on
traffic
for a number of years and the
corresponding data on some economic indicator such as GNP is also available,
then the data can yield an econometric model of the following type:
Loge P = Ao+ Ai Loge GNP
where
P
=
Traffic Volume
GNP
=
Gross National Product
Ao
=
Regression Constant
Ai
=
Regression (Coefficient
The value of Ai
is known as the Elasticity Coefficient. The Elasticity
Coefficient is the factor by which the GNP growth rate has to be multiplied to
arrive at the growth rate of traffic.
The following example illustrates how this analysis is carried out.
The time series data on Traffic Volume at a certain location and the
corresponding data on GDP of the region are given in the following table. The
GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 5 per cent during 1995-2005 and at 6 per cent
during 2005-2015.
Determine the possible rate of growth of traffic during
1995-2005 and 2005-2015.

4.5.
Modifications
to Forecasts
Traffic forecasts have to be modified to take into account possible traffic
diversions and generated traffic.
Traffic diversions include traffic that is likely to be diverted to the facility
from other highway or railway or similar transport corridors, and also traffic likely
to be diverted from the facility to other transport corridors.
Generated
traffic
is
that which comes
into being because of the
construction of the new facility and the attractiveness of the new facility. This
traffic would not have materialised had the facility not been built.
5. DESIGN PERIOD
5.1.
Stage Construction
In India, roads are built on a stage construction principle due to lack of
resources. In such cases, the design period can be 5-10 years. For large projects,
where the construction is done in one stage, the design period can be 15-20 years.
Traffic projections are done accordingly.
While projecting
traffic,
it may so happen that the projected volume
exceeds the capacity. The capacity itself is calculated from hourly maximum value
and using the value of ratio of the peak-hourly traffic to the daily traffic. While
traffic cannot exceed the peak hourly value, the peak period itself may get extended
in duration. This has to be kept in view and the traffic volume restricted to a
reasonable value of daily traffic.
