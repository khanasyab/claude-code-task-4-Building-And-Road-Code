SCOPE
This Document covers the specification and
design of
a)
Single-Coat Surface Dressing and
b)
Two-Coat Surface Dressing
Using penetration grade bitumen and cationic
bituminous emulsion as binder.
The work shall consist of application of one
coat or two coats of Surface Dressing, each coat
consisting of a layer of bituminous binder sprayed
on a previously prepared base, followed by a
cover of stone aggregates rolled in to fonn the
wearing surface to the requirement of these
specifications.
The specifications are intended to indicate
what
is considered to be a good practice for
construction of single-coat Surface Dressing and
two-coat Surface Dressing and shall apply unless
modified by special provisions
to take into
account unusual conditions.

DEFINITIONS
3.1.
Surface Dressing
Surface Dressing
is
a common and cost
effective surface treatment used (a) to provide a
dust free wearing surface over a granular base,
(b) to provide surface impermeability against rain-
water percolation into the pavement, (c) to arrest
disintegration of the road surface, (d) to provide
a non-skid riding surface, and (e) to serve as a
renewal coat for periodic maintenance of
bituminous surfaces.
The Surface Dressing work consists of
application (by spraying using
a
suitable
equipment) of appropriate grade of bitumen/
emulsion on a previously prepared base followed
by application of a coat of cover material of
appropriate size and grading and well rolled.
Surface Dressing does not enhance the structural
strength nor does it restore the riding quality of a
surface having large surface irregularities.

Figs.l (a) and (b) schematically represent a
section of Surface Dressing just after rolling and
after some traffic has passed.
It
is seen in the
diagram that a part of the aggregate has intruded
into the base course.
Since aggregate particles evenly lie on their
flattest side, the average thickness of the Surface
Dressing is the average of least dimension of the
aggregates. This
is referred as Average Least
Dimension (ALD) of the aggregates (Fig. 2). When
aggregates are dropped from a spreader, the voids
in the aggregates are about 50 per cent. After the
rolling and traffic operations, the air voids drop to
about 30 per cent and there is further reduction of
air voids to about 20 per cent when exposed to
traffic. The thickness of the finished layer
approximates ALD. The optimum thickness to
Average Least Dimension
Fig. 2 Average Least Dimension (ALD) of aggregates
which bitumen should rise is about 75 per cent of
the average vertical dimension of the aggregates.
If the thickness of binder is more than this optimum
thickness,
it may cause bleeding and make the
surface relatively slippery, and if it is less, it may
cause loss of aggregates.

3.2.
Single-Coat Surface Dressing
The structure is formed by spraying a layer
of binder on the previously prepared pavement
surface, spreading one layer of cover aggregates
and rolling.
3.3.
Two-Coat Surface Dressing
The structure is formed by spraying a layer of
binder and then spreading of one layer of cover
aggregate and rolling, followed by a secord krer of
binder, spreading of another layer ofco ver ag*"
j; tes
and rolling. The size of second layer of u_gr _ ^ i tes is
smaller than thai of the first layer aggregates
3.4.
Surface Dressing Using Pre-coaled
Aggregates
This technique
is the same as conventional
Surface Dressing except that the cover material
is aggregates pre-coated with binder.

MATERIALS
4.1.
Binder
4.1.1. Genera! requirements: The binder shall
conform to the requirements as specified and
provided for in the proposal and satisfy the related
specification,
e.g., paving bitumen (Type
1)
conforming to IS 73 or cationic bitumen emulsion
conforming to IS 8887. The grade of binder to be
used would depend upon the climatic conditions.
The binder should be fluid enough to permit uniform
spraying. After the cover aggregates are rolled
into position, binder should be hard enough to hold
the particles in position against displacement by
traffic.
4.1.2.
Paving bitumen: For Surface Dressing
using paving bitumen, the binder shall be paving
bitumen
of
a
suitable
penetration
grade
appropriate to the region, traffic, rainfall and other
environmental conditions as directed by the
Engineer-in-Charge. The binder should have a
viscosity at the time of application, such that it is
fluid enough to permit uniform spraying. The
application temperature for the grade of binder
used shall be as given in Table- 1(a).
4.13.
Cationic bituminous emulsion: For
Surface Dressing using bitumen emulsion, the
binder shall be of cationic type bitumen emulsion
of appropriate grade (Rapid Setting) and having
bitumen content of 65 per cent minimum by
weight. The emulsion is said to have set when the
water breaks away leaving the black residual

bitumen on the surface. The application temperature
for the emulsion shall be as given in Table- 1(b).
Before opening, the cationic bitumen emulsion
drums should be roiled at slow speed, to and fro,
for a distance of about 10 metres, 5 to 6 times to
mix the contents properly.
4.1.4.
Binder for pre-coated aggregates: For
Surface Dressing with pre-coated aggregates, binder
shall be a paving bitumen of suitable penetration
grade. The grade of binder to be used for pre-coated
aggregates would depend upon the climate conditions
at the construction site.
4.2.
Cover Materials (Aggregate)
4.2.1.
General requirements: The aggregates
shall consist of crushed stone, crushed gravel
(shingle) or other crushed aggregates, as specified,
and shall have clean, strong, durable, and fairly

be
used. The aggregate
shall preferably be
hydrophobic in nature and of low porosity.
4«2.2,
Requirements for cationic-bitumen-
emuision Surface Dressing: The
general
requirement of aggregates as stated in Clause 4.2.
shall apply. Additionally, the following points are
relevant to the aggregates for Surface Dressing
using bitumen emulsion.
Damp aggregates can be used for Surface
Dressing with cationic bitumen emulsion and
hence when the aggregates are dusty, they shall
be cleaned by dipping or washing or by sprinkling
water copiously.
Aggregates should preferably be hydrophobic
in nature and of low porosity. However, even the

IRC: 110-2005
aggregates having stripping value higher than the
permissible limit can be considered for use to the
extent of the anti-stripping properties of emulsions,
as directed by the Engineer-in-Charge. Because
of the very nature, cationic emulsions have better
adhesive properties with wet aggregates as well
as aggregates having stripping tendencies.
4.2.3.
Physical requirements: The aggregate
should satisfy the physical requirements given in
Table-2.
4.2.4. Grading and size of aggregates: The size
of aggregates to be used shall depend on the
type of surface over which
it
is laid and the
traffic intensities. Table-3 may be used as a guidance.
For Surface Dressing course, use of single-
sized aggregates is recommended. Although a well
graded aggregate is usually considered to be the
best gradation for compacted asphalt aggregate
mixture, it is quite undesirable for Surface Dressing
construction because the oversize aggregates are
liable to suffer fracture or displacements and the
small size aggregates are liable to sink below the
bituminous layer. Since with good design and
construction practice, the binder rises to only about
3/4
th of the average depth of cover aggregates,
the tyres are prevented from making direct contact
with the binder and also the surface channels
between the aggregate particles provide rapid
removal of water between the tyre and road
surface, reducing the chances of hydro-planning.
If same size aggregates are used, tyre gets contact
with all of them firmly. This has been pictorially
represented
in

of these gradings.

Pre-coated
aggregates:
As
an
alternative
to use of an adhesion agent the
aggregates may be pre-coated before they are
spread except when the sprayed binder film
is
bitumen emulsion. The aggregates shall be pre-
coated with 0.75 to
1 per cent of its weight of
binder and shall not be pre-coated simultaneously
with the paving operation. The aggregates free
from dust or fine particles shall be preheated to
160°C for pre-coating and then mixed with binder
heated
to
its application temperature. The
aggregate and binder should be thoroughly mixed
in a mixer (of approved type) till all the aggregates
are uniformly coated. The pre-coated aggregates
shall be allowed to cure for at least one week or
until they become non-sticky and can be taken
out easily from baskets like normal aggregates.
4.3.
Quantities
4.3.1.
The
quantities
of
aggregates
and
bituminous binder required will depend on the
nominal size of the aggregate and the extent of its
embedment into the surface. Approximate rate of
application of aggregates, penetration grade bitumen
and emulsion required under average conditions are
given in Tables 5(a) and (b). Guidance on the design
of Surface Dressing and spread rates of aggregates
and binder is given in Appendix.

CONSTRUCTION METHOD
5.1.
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Preferably, the Surface Dressing work shall
be carried out when the atmospheric temperature
in shade is 16°C or above for penetration grade
bitumen and 10°C or above when cationic
bitumen emulsion is used. No bituminous material
shall normally be applied when the surface or the
cover material is damp, when the weather is foggy
or rainy or during dust-storm. In the cases where
emulsion is used as binder, the work can be carried
out when the base is damp but there should be no
standing water in depressions.
5.2.
Arrangements of Traffic
The road to be treated shall be closed to traffic
in length equal to one day's work. Suitable
diversions shall be made to divert the
traffic.

Notes
:
(a,In the case of two-coat Surface Dressing using bitumen emulsion, emulsion quantities for each coat are added
together and about 40 to 45 per cent of the total is applied for the first application and the balance for the
second application. Field trial may be required to adjust the quantity.
""Excluding the quantity of binder required for pre-coating of aggregates.
(c)The suggested quantities of binder application are for Surface Dressing, over existing bituminous surfaces and
primed granular bases.
diversionary signs, warning red lights, etc. shall
be made for the convenience and safety of traffic.
All diversions
shall be kept watered so as to
prevent dust getting on to the cleaned or painted
surface.
5.3.
Equipment
All equipment necessary for the proper
construction of work shall be on the site of the
work in good condition. The description of some
of the equipment used for Surface Dressing
is
given in IRC:SP:34 "General Guidelines about the
Equipment for Bituminous Surface Dressing".
Spraying and compaction by synchronized
equipment may be preferred for better control and
uniformity
in construction.
In this type of
equipment, binder and aggregates are spread in a
coordinated
way.
The
binder
spraying
automatically stops
if the aggregate spreading
ends (or vice-versa) and, therefore, there
is no
excess binder waiting for the aggregates to be
spread. This ensures better quality of construction
and subsequent durability in terms of strong
binder-aggregate bond.
5.4.
Preparation of Base
The underlying surface course on which
Surface Dressing is to be laid shall be prepared,
9



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 28
======================================================================
IRC: 110-2005
shaped and conditioned to a uniform grade,
camber and section as specified. Any depressions
or pot-holes
shall be properly made up and
compacted sufficiently in advance. All pot-holes
and depressions shall be filled up with a suitable
premix material and rammed or rolled properly
and brought to shape. Where the existing surface
shows sign of "fatting-up". such portion should
be rectified.
The surface should be swept clean free of
caked earth and other foreign matter cleaned first
with hard brushes, then with softer brushes and
finally blowing off with sacks or gunny bags to
remove the fine dust.
It
is important that the
surface
be
dry
and
thoroughly
cleaned
immediately before applying the binder.
If the
base to be treated consists of granular material, a
suitable bituminous primer, should be applied
uniformly, preferably by a mechanical sprayer. It
is preferable to slightly dampen the surface
if
emulsion is used as binder.
If the base to be covered by the Surface
Dressing is an old bituminous surfacing,
it shall
be swept clean and free from sand, dirt, dust and
other loose, deleterious, foreign matter, by means
of mechanical vacuum sweepers and blowers, if
available, supplemented by hand brooms
wherever necessary or by means of wire brushes,
small picks, brass brooms, etc., and shall be dry.
Whenever a prime coat is applied on granular
surface, no bituminous material shall be applied
until the prime coat has thoroughly cured. The
edges of the surface to be treated shall be defined
by rope lines stretched in position.
5.5.
First Coat
5.5.1.
General: This Clause describes the
application of binder and aggregates for single-
coat Surface Dressing, or first coat of the two-
coat Surface Dressing.
5.5.2.
Application of binder for first coat:
After the surface to be treated has been prepared
as
specified above,
the binder heated
to
appropriate temperature as specified shall be
sprayed uniformly over the sur
cace preferably
using appropriate mechanical sprayers. During
spraying, the ratio between the /ruck speed and
pump revolution speed
is held constant, either
by automatic control or manually oy [he operator.
Tables 5(a) and (b) give approximate quantity of
application of binder per m2 area of surfacing.
Binder
shall be applied
to the
su face
uniformly. It should be ensured that the required
rate of spray of binder is achieved right from the
starting point and when the work is resumed the
binder
is not sprayed on the surface of earlier
completed work. This can be done by covering,
the surface of the completed work with building
paper/bitumen impregnated paper for a length to
be sufficient for the bitumen distributor (manually
controlled) to attain the required rate of spraying.
Excessive deposit of bituminous material upon
the road surface caused by stopping or starting
the sprayer, by leakage or otherwise,
shall be
immediately removed.
5.5.3.
Application
of
cover
materia!
(aggregates): Immediately after the application
of binder, clean, dry aggregates (in the case of
emulsion, the aggregates may be damp) of the
size and quantity mentioned in Tables 5(a) and (b)
shall be spread uniformly by means of a mechanical
grit spreader so as to cover the coated surface
completely with a single layer of aggregates.
5.5.4.
Rolling:
Immediately
after
the
application of the cover material as described in
Clause 5.5.3, the entire surface shall be rolled,
preferably by a pneumatic tyred roller, or with a
60 to 80 kN smooth wheeled road roller. The
rolling
shall begin
at the edge and proceed
lengthwise over the area to be rolled, lapping not
less than one third of the roller tread, and proceed
towards the centre. When the centre is reached,
the rolling shall then start at the opposite side and
again proceed towards the centre. In the super-
elevated portions, the rolling should proceed from
inner to outer edge. While the rolling
is in
progress, additional aggregate shall be spread by
hand in required quantity to fill irregularities and
to prevent picking up of the aggregate by the
roller. Rolling shall be continued until the particles
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 28
======================================================================
IRC: 110-2005
are firmly embedded in the bituminous layer and
forms a uniform closed surface. Excessive rolling
which results in crushing of aggregate particles,
shall be avoided.
5.6.
Second coat
5.6.1.
General: This Clause describes the
application of binder and aggregates for the second
coat of the two-coat Surface Dressing.
5.6.2.
Time Interval between first coat and
second coat: Where Surface Dressing in two
coats is specified, the second coat should not be
applied until the
first coat has been opened to
traffic for 2 to 3 weeks.
5.6.3.
Application of binder: Prior to the
application of second coat of binder, the surface
shall be cleaned and loose materials and foreign
matters removed. After getting the surface
irregularities
corrected
and
the
surface
conditioned to camber and gradient, a second
application of binder heated to appropriate
temperature shall be uniformly sprayed preferably
with a mechanical sprayer at the rate specified in
Tables 5(a) and (b). When using cationic emulsion,
the aggregates of the first coat are likely to appear
loose and unbonded in a few spots. These will get
bonded once the emulsion breaks or sets and should
not be disturbed.
5.6.4.
Application
of
aggregates:
Immediately after application of binder, aggregates
shall be spread uniformly preferably by means of a
mechanical grit spreader so as to cover the surface
completely at the rate specified in Tables 5(a) and
(b). While rolling, the surface shall be broomed with
a view to ensure uniform spreading of aggregate.
After each pass of the roller, depressions should be
removed to give a uniform surface.
5.6.5.
Rolling for second coat: Soon after the
aggregate is spread uniformly, rolling shall be done
preferably with a pneumatic tyre roller or with a
60 to 80 kN static roller in the same manner as
described in Clause 5.5.4. For Surface Dressing
with cationic emulsion, the finishing rolling can be
performed on the next day; this helps to give a
firm surface.
5.7.
Finishing
The surface evenness of the completed work
in longitudinal and transverse directions shall be
within the limits specified in Table 6. Frequency

The longitudinal profile shall be checked with
a 3-metre long straight edge, at the middle of each
traffic lane along a line parallel to the center line
of the road. The transverse profile
shall be
checked with a series of three camber template
at intervals of 10 metres.
It is emphasized that Surface Dressing by itself
cannot remove any undulations present in the base
or the surface on which it is applied. It is, therefore,
essential that all operations of rectification to meet
the requirements set out above be carried out on
the receiving surface before the work of Surface
Dressing is begun.
For detailed guidance in this respect, reference
may be made to IRC.SP: 16 "Guidelines for Surface
Evenness of Highway Pavement-".

Opening to Traffic

the binder, the finished surface she ll be opened to
traffic on the following day bus
if in special
circumstances, the road is required to be opened
to traffic immediately after rolling, speed rv the
traffic shall be limited to 20 kmh till the follox ing
day. When bitumen emulsion is used, the road may
be opened to traffic not earlier than 4 hours after
rolling and preferably after 24 hours. Controlling
of traffic shall be done by some suitable device,
such
as, barricading and posting of watchman,
installation of suitable signs, etc. consistent with
safety.

Appendix
Guidance on the Design of Surface Dressing
A.l.
General
The design of Surface Dressing
is made to
decide about the (i) type of Surface Dressing, (ii)
aggregate type and gradation and binder type, and
(iii) quantity of binder and aggregate. These are
decided based on considerations of (a) availability
of materials, (b) relative economy among materials,
(c)
traffic,
e.g., volume, percentage of trucks,
permitted speed,
(d) operating conditions,
e.g.,
winter maintenance, (e) environmental conditions,
e.g., climatic conditions, vegetation, urbanization, and
(f) alignment and grade of existing road, etc.
The single-coat Surface Dressing is a versatile
treatment and, therefore, it is currently being used
for practically all types of traffic conditions. Under
heavy traffic conditions, the two-coat Surface
Dressing is preferred.
The
first step in the design of a Surface
Dressing is the selection of the nominal size of
aggregates. Large size aggregates are required
for soft surfaces or where traffic
is very heavy.
Small size aggregates are best for hard surfaces
or light traffic. Where skid resistance is important
large size aggregates should be used.
In selecting the nominal size of aggregate for
two-coat Surface Dressing, the
size of the
aggregates should be selected on the basis of the
hardness of the existing surface and the traffic
category as indicated in Table 3 under Clause 4.2.4.
The nominal size of aggregates for the second
coat should be about half the nominal size of that
of the first coat.
The assessment of the hardness of the existing
road surface may be made on the basis of
judgement with the help of definitions given in
Table A
1.
The following two methods are used for
estimating the rate of application of the rate of
aggregate and bitumen. The second method
is
more elaborate as it takes into account the volume
of traffic, condition of the existing surface, climate
and the type of aggregates and is recommended.
Table A
1
: Categories of Road Surface Based on Hardness
Category of Surface
Definition
Very Hard
Surfaces, such as, concrete, or very lean bituminous pavements with dry
stony surfaces, into which negligible penetration of aggregates will occur
even under the heaviest traffic.
Hard
Surfaces into which aggregates will penetrate only slightly under heavy
traffic.
Normal
Surfaces into which aggregates will penetrate moderately under medium
and heavy traffic.
Soft
Surfaces into which aggregates will penetrate considerably under medium
and heavy traffic.
Very Soft
Surfaces, usually rich in binder, into which even large aggregates will be
submerged under heavy traffic.

at various
stages of Surface Dressing construction. When the
aggregates are just laid, the voids may be assumed
to be 50 per cent, after rolling and compaction,
reorientation of particles take place and voids
become 30 per cent and finally when it is open to
traffic the voids become about 20 per cent.

Surface Dressing is:

•(1)
Where ALD
is the average least dimension
of aggregates in mm and is determined as per the
procedure described in the Clause A.2.2.
10 per cent of the aggregates may be assumed
to be lost in whip off due to traffic. Therefore,
the correct estimate of required aggregate is:

Completed Surface Dressing where traffic is
operational has voids of 20 per cent, out of which
bitumen should occupy 3/4

(i.e., 75 per cent)
thickness. Thus the quantity of bitumen required
in kg per m
2 of area for laying single-coat Surface
Dressing is:
100 X
100 x
•(3)
However, for the case of Surface Dressing
with bituminous emulsion, the binder should
occupy upto the level of ALD, because,
after
evaporation, the level of residual binder will be
3/4
th of ALD only (as shown in Fig. A 2).

Design of two-coat Surface Dressing is to be
done separately for each layer, except that the
aggregate size of the second coat must be smaller
than the aggregate size of first layer.
A.2.2. Determination of ALD:
If the
aggregates used for Surface Dressing construction
are
all of same size and spherical in shape, the
ALD will be equal to the median
size of the
aggregates. However, in
reality
it
is not
so.
Empirical relationship between the median size,
flakiness index and ALD has been presented in
Fig. A 3 in the form of a nomograph. The sieve
size through which 50 per cent of the aggregates
pass
is the median size of the aggregates. The
flakiness index is found out separately. A line is
drawn joining the median aggregate size and the
flakiness index to obtain ALD.

This method
is more suitable for general
application. The design steps are
:

Select nominal size of aggregates using Table 3

includes a 10 per cent allowance for whip off.
7.
The rate of spread of binder
is adjusted to
allow for the type of binder used. For penetration
grade binder, decrease the rate of spread by 10
per cent.
For emulsion, multiply the rate of spread given
in the chart by 'Z'
where, Z =
—
Bitumen content of emulsion (%.)
8.
The aggregates application rate needs to be
further adjusted by observing on site whether any
extra binder remains after spreading, indicating
too low a rate of application, or whether there is
overlapping of aggregates, indicating too high an
application rate.
