Introduction 
Coal is the most easily available fuel for power generation in India, and ever growing demand of 
electricity will continue to make use of this source of energy. Thermal power stations generally use 
coal of lower grades with ash content as high as 30 to 50 percent. Higher grades of coal are reserved 
for metallurgical applications. When pulverised coal is burned in a furnace at the power stations, it 
produces very fine ash called “Fly ash” which comes out of the furnace along with flue gases. Fly ash 
accounts for about 75-85 per cent of the total ash formed. The remaining coarser fraction of the ash 
falls to the bottom of the furnace where it sinters to form “Bottom ash”. Fly ash is removed from the 
flue gases using electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and is initially collected in ESP hoppers. This ESP dry 
fly ash is conveyed to the silos pneumatically from where it is generally taken by the user agencies. 
Bottom ash (after crushing by jaw crusher) and available fly ash from hopper/ silos are mixed with 
water and disposed off in a slurry form to ponds. This deposit is called “Pond ash”. However, generally 
the term fly ash is used as a generic name to denote any of these three types of ashes.

Power Station
Fly ash availability is widely spread across the country.  The details of thermal power stations, their 
capacities and availability of fly ash is available on website of Central Electricity Authority (www.cea.
nic.in). A general map of locations of thermal power plants is placed at Figure-III may be referred in 
this regard.
1.1 
Properties of Fly Ash
The physical and chemical properties of fly ashes vary, with in acceptable range, depending upon the 
type of coal, its grinding and combustion techniques, and their collection and disposal systems. Fly 
ash (especially when collected from ESP in dry form) reacts with lime in presence of moisture to form 
cementitious compounds. This is known as pozzolanic activity. The pozzolanic property of fly ash enables

it to be used in concrete to replace a part of cement. When fly ash is disposed in slurry form (mixture of 
ash and water) to ash ponds, its pozzolanic property gets reduced As a result pond ash (and also bottom 
ash) are not considered to be suitable for cement replacement, but they can be used as fill material for 
embankment construction or for mixing with moorum to improve CBR/ plasticity properties of moorum. 
The indicative range of physical and chemical properties of Indian fly ashes are given in Table  I & II:

Gainful utilisation of fly ash
There has been steady rise in the production of fly ash over the years due to increased demand for 
power and the dependence on coal for producing electricity. Figure-IV depicts fly ash generation and 
utilization since 1994 and Figure-V given an overview of fly ash utilization in various sectors. 
Construction of roads offers a gainful way for bulk utilisation of fly ash. CSIR-Central Road Research 
Institute itself and also under projects of Fly Ash Mission, Dept. of Science & Technology, Govt. of 
India has carried out extensive research over many years and developed techniques for using fly ash 
in various ways in road construction. Many demonstration road projects using fly ash have also been 
constructed in association with state PWDs.

 2.0 Favourable properties of fly ash for road construction  
•	
Lightweight as compared to commonly used fill material (local soils), therefore, fly ash causes 
lesser settlements. It is especially attractive for embankment construction over weak sub-
soils (clayey sub-soils) where excessive weight of embankment may cause failure.
•	
Usually pond ash and bottom ash have higher value of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) as 
compared to soil, which can lead to less pavement thickness
•	
Pozzolanic hardening property imparts additional strength to the road pavements/ 
embankments
•	
Amenable to stabilisation using cement or lime 
•	
Can be compacted over a wide range of moisture content, and therefore, results in lesser 
variations in density with changes in moisture content
•	
Easy to handle and compact because the material is lightweight and there are no large lumps 
to be broken, fly ash is available in powdered form
•	
Can be compacted using either vibratory or static rollers
•	
Offers greater stability of slopes due to higher angle of friction. Value of angle of internal 
friction increases even more upon compaction.
•	
High permeability ensures free and efficient drainage. After rainfall, water gets drained out 
quickly ensuring better workability than soil, especially during monsoons. Work on fly ash 
fills/ embankments can be restarted within a few hours after rainfall, while in case of soil it 
requires much longer time period
•	
Faster rate of consolidation; a major part of decrease in volume occurs during primary consolidation 
phase, which is generally rapid, thus making it an ideal material for embankment fills
•	
Considerably low compressibility results in negligible subsequent settlement within the fill
•	
Conserves good earth, which is precious topsoil, thereby protecting the environment
3.0 
 Construction of fly ash embankment 
Pond ash is the preferred material for embankment construction. Bottom ash, if available 
separately in a thermal power station, can also be used for embankment construction. The 
geotechnical characteristics of fly ash which control its use as an embankment material are 
compaction characteristics and shear strength. The grain size of fly ash is generally similar to 
silts. Coarser type of ashes (pond ash and bottom ash) may be having higher amounts of fine sand 
content. After compacting the original ground/ foundation soil, embankment construction using 
fly ash can be started. Since fly ash is non plastic powdery type material, vibratory rollers are 
preferred for achieving better compaction. However, static rollers can also be used successfully 
for constructing rural road embankments using fly ash, by keeping loose layer thickness to be 
about 200 mm. Loose layer thickness can be increased to 400 mm if vibratory compactors are

used. Rural roads generally have embankment heights less than 2 m or so, hence they can be 
constructed using side slope of 1:1.5 (Vertical:Horizontal). In case of embankments of higher 
height, side slope of 1:2 (Vertical:Horizontal) is advocated for embankment construction using 
fly ash. 
Fly ash embankments require provision of side covers using good earth. Fly ash is a non plastic 
material, without any cohesion and its ‘c’ value would be zero. Because of this nature, it is prone for 
erosion. Fly ash embankment if left unprotected would erode due to rain and even wind. Hence side 
slopes should be protected using soil and fly ash should be used to construct core (inside) portion 
of the embankment. Any soil fill material which is suitable for usage in embankment construction 
(which satisfies criteria laid down in MORD Specifications for using soil as an embankment fill 
material) can be used for constructing side cover. Soil available in the roadway can also be utilised 
(after digging a trench) if feasible (Figure-VII). The soil used for cover should have maximum dry 
density more than 1.52g/cc when height of embankment is upto 3 m and  in areas not subjected to 
extensive flooding, otherwise the maximum dry density of cover soil should not be less than 1.60 
g/cc when tested according to IS:2720 (Part 8)-1983. Subgrade/earthen shoulder material should 
have minimum compacted dry density of 1.75 g/cc. Plasticity index of cover soil should be between 
5 to 9 percent. Chemical analysis or determination of deleterious constituents would be necessary 
in salt-infested areas or when presence of salts is suspected in the borrow material. Expensive soils 
should not be used for construction of cover, unless it is properly stabilised using lime. The thickness 
of side soil cover depends upon height of embankment. For rural roads having embankment height 
less than one m, about 30 cm thick soil cover would suffice. For embankments of higher heights 
generally 50 cm thick soil cover is provided. Soil cover and fly ash are to be laid and compacted 
simultaneously (Figure-VIII). When fly ash embankments are to be constructed for height more than 
3m, intermediate soil layers are provided and side cover thickness should also be increased. Turfing 
on side slopes reduces chances of any rain-cut formation.

Special Publication IRC SP:58 and Clause 306 of MORD Specifications for Rural Roads-2014 can be

In case, the subgrade soil at site is of CBR about 5% and above, a reverse trench method can be 
adopted for using fl y ash and minimising the quanti ty of earth from borrow pits. In such cases, aft er 
laying out the alignment a trapezoidal cross secti onal trench (as shown in Figure X) can be excavated 
and material stacked on sides. The trench then can be fi lled in layers with appropriate compacti on. 
Even the core of embankment can be made of fl y ash above ground and the excavated earth can be 
used for making all round cover of 300 mm including subgrade.

 Fly ash usage for constructing road subgrade
Many pond ashes possess very good CBR value. Tests conducted at CSIR-Central Road Research 
Institute on 15 samples of pond ash showed CBR value varying from 4 to 22 per cent with an average 
CBR value of 13 per cent. Using pond ash alone for subgrade construction would not be advisable 
since pond ash being non plastic, it is prone for erosion. Many in-situ soils which have significant clay 
content, possess high plasticity, low CBR and hence generally considered unsuitable for subgrade 
construction. By mixing pond ash with such in-situ soils, CBR value can be increased and plasticity of 
the soil can be reduced. The ratio of mixing pond ash and soil can be decided based on mechanical 
stabilisation technique (given in IRC SP:89-2010) which depends on grain size distribution of pond 
ash and soil. As per MORD Specifications, maximum dry density (MDD) of subgrade material should 
be 16.5 kN/m3 when tested as per IS 2720 (Part 7). This aspect should also be considered while 
designing the mix. Intimate mixing of these two materials must be ensured for success of this 
technique. Tractor towed rotavator or disc harrow can be used for mixing soil and pond ash. Table-
IV shows test results on pond ash from Panipat thermal power station and local soil. Bottom ash if 
available can also be used in a similar way.

6.0 
 Fly ash usage for improving moorum/ gravel to construct GSB layer
Similar to subgrade improvement, pond ash can be used for improving the gradation or plasticity 
or CBR of moorum. Many locally available moorums have high plasticity properties rendering them 
unsuitable for using in GSB layer. To improve such moorums, river sand is generally mixed with them. 
Instead of river sand, pond ash wherever available can be a suitable alternative. The proportion 
of mixing pond ash and moorum would have to be determined based on mechanical stabilisation 
technique as given in IRC SP:89-2010.

7.0 
 Cement or lime stabilised fly ash for sub-base / base course
Fly ash chemically reacts with lime or cement, but much of the reactivity of fly ash is lost when 
it is mixed with water and disposed to ash ponds. Hence for use in lime or cement stabilisation, 
fly ash collected in dry form is preferred. Pond ash can also be stabilised using cement. But, 
cement requirement for pond ash stabilisation may be higher than cement required for fly ash 
stabilisation. Lime stabilisation is generally carried out using quick lime (CaO) or hydrated lime 
Ca(OH)2. IRC SP:89-2010 stipulates that purity of lime (CaO content) should be atleast 50 per 
cent for using commercially available lime for stabilisation. However, it is difficult to ensure 
good quality of lime (lime with specified CaO content) since lime is mostly manufactured in a 
small scale by unskilled operators. 
For cement stabilisation, ordinary Portland cement, Portland pozzolana cement or Portland 
slag cement (IS:269, 455 or 1489) can be used. MORD Specifications for Rural Roads provides 
gradation limits for cement stabilised base course and sub-base course materials. Fly ash or 
pond ash being fine grained materials may not conform to gradations suggested in MORD 
Specifications. But this should not be constraint for using fly ash in cement stabilised layer, 
since fly ash responds to cement stabilisation in a very good manner and develops adequate 
unconfined compressive strength. As per MORD Specifications, cement stabilised mix shall be 
designed for a minimum laboratory 7 day compressive strength of 2.76 MPa for use in base 
course and 1.70 MPa for sub-base. In case cement stabilised fly ash (cement+fly ash mixture) 
does not develop adequate compressive strength to be used for base course construction, 
addition of coarse aggregates to cement+fly ash mixture can lead to considerable improvement 
in compressive strength. Cement stabilised material should also be tested for durability as 
specified in IRC SP:89. Table-V shows comparison of gradation of fly ash and pond ash from 
Kahalgaon thermal power station with that of gradation of cement stabilised material as 
specified in MORD Specifications. Table-VI shows unconfined compressive strength test results 
for cement stabilised fly ash and pond ash from Kahalgaon thermal power station. Table-VII 
and VIII show chemical and physical requirements of fly ash to be used as a pozzolana, as 
given in MORD Specifications.

Constructi on of cement or lime stabilised fl y ash layer can be taken up using tractor towed 
implements. Fly ash in required quanti ty should be spread over the stretch. Cement or lime bags 
should be spott ed, i.e., required quanti ty of cement/lime should be placed over uncompacted fl y 
ash layer at required spacing. Mixing of fl y ash and cement / lime can be carried out using tractor 
towed rotavator. Required quanti ty of water can be sprinkled over fl y ash+cement mix and remixed 
using rotavator. Constructi on of cement / lime stabilised fl y ash layer should be carried out as per

 Environmental concerns
The major environmental concerns with respect to the potenti al impact of fl y ash usage in road and 
embankment constructi on are erosion of fl y ash due to run-off , dust nuisance and possibility of leaching 
of heavy metals into sub-soil. During the constructi on of fl y ash embankments, dust nuisance (fl y ash 
parti cles being dispersed into air on account of wind) can be minimised by keeping the ash moist. A 
protecti ve cover of soil is provided for fl y ash embankments to prevent such possibiliti es. Side soil cover 
protects fl y ash core from running water (surface run-off ) also. Erosion protecti on can be enhanced by 
grass turfi ng on the side slopes. Access of rain water from the top of embankment can be minimised 
by providing top soil cover for embankment, i.e. the subgrade and other pavement layers which restrict 
ingress of water. Indian coal contains a fairly high amount of ash content, hence, concentrati on of heavy 
metals in the ash is low when compared to ash obtained from imported coals, which have lesser ash 
content. As a result the leachates produced have lower concentrati on of heavy metals. Further, studies 
done on fl y ash from diff erent sources in India have shown fl y ash-water mixture to be basic in nature, 
which tends to restrict the heavy metal leaching. Tests conducted on fl y ash and borrow soil have 
shown that there is practi cally not much diff erence in heavy metal concentrati on that is encountered 
in soil vis-à-vis fl y ash (refer table-IX). Hence, it can be stated using fl y ash for road works is safe from 
environmental point of view. In USA also, Environment Protecti on Agency (EPA) has classifi ed fl y ash as 
a Non-hazardous waste for its use in road works.

 Way forward
Fly ash that was considered  as a waste product is a very good construction material for roads 
and embankments. The engineering benefits obtained due to use of fly ash as embankment 
fill material and for road pavement construction are well established. Adoption of fly ash for 
embankment construction will result in saving of precious topsoil besides leading to reduction 
in construction cost in most of the cases.  In addition, there is scarcity of soil and large scale 
road network may not be possible without use of fly ash as an embankment material. Many 
road and embankment projects have been completed across the country using fly ash but still 
numerous practicing engineers are not well versed with fly ash usage. Unfamiliarity regarding 
use of fly ash in road works can be overcome through demonstration projects and training the 
engineers/construction agencies. But adequate attention should be paid to characterisation of 
fly ash and quality control during construction to ensure better performance, so that fly ash can 
be turned from a liability into an asset.
