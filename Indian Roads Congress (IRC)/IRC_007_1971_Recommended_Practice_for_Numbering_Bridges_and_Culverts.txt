RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR NUMBERING
BRIDGES AND CULVERTS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1
.
All culverts and bridges on a highway should be assigned
separate numbers.
This is a means to their easy identification by the
maintenance and inspecting personnel.
A uniform system
of num-
bering the cross-drainage structures being desirable, the Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
of
the Indian Roads Congress has laid
down this standard
practice.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The recommended
practice
is meant for uniform adop-
tion on all roads in the country.
3.
METHOD OF NUMBERING
3.1.
Cross-drainage
works on
a
road
shall be numbered in
serial order, in each kilometre separately.
3.2.
The number shall be in the form of a fraction, the nume-
rator
denoting
the
number
of kilometre
in which the structure is
situated and the denominator
the
kilometre-wise
serial
number
of
the structure.
For
instance, the 5th cross-drainage structure in 4th
kilometre (i.e. between kilometre stones 3 and 4) shall be designated
4
25
as
, and the 8th structure in 25th kilometre as —=—
.
J
o
3.3.
If any new
culverts bridges are built subsequently, say
between the 3rd and 4th structures in kilometre 375, the same
shall
375
375
be designated
as
q/
,
etc.
4.
MANNER OF INSCRIPTION
4.1.
The number of the structure shall be inscribed
near
the
top
of
the
left
hand
side parapet wall as seen by traffic in the end
elevation when approaching the structure from each
direction.
Figs.
1 and 2 illustrate this.

4.2.
In situations where instead of parapet walls, the structure
is provided with railings,
but
having
no
end
supporting pillars on
which the number
could
be
inscribed, the number of the structure
Inn
o™
ndlCatelby means of a seParate numbering plate of the size
JOO x 300 mm.
There
shall
be
two such numbering plates, one for
each
direction
of
travel.
The
plates
shall
be
welded
or
fixed
securely to the railing on the left hand
side
facing
the carriageway
as close to the entrance to the structure as possible.
4.3.
In the
case
of buried
culverts,
such
as

there
are usually no parapet walls or railings at the roadway

a
cross-section
of
150x 150 mm and exposed height 300 mm,
shall
be
set up one on
each side to mark the position of the culvert.
Care
shall
be
taken
to locate the marker posts fully outside the prescribed roadway width
The
culvert number
shall
not
appear
on the marker posts but be
either
engraved
or
painted
at
their base as shown in Plate I
In
addition, the number might also be inscribed
at
a
suitable location
on the head wall of the structure above the highest water level.
4.4
The
numerals
used
shall
be 100 mm high and of inter-
national form conforming to
the IRC: 30-1968
