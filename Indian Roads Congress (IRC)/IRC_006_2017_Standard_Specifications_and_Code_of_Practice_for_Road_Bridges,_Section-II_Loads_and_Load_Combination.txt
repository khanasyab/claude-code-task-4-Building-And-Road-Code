STANDARD  SPECIFICATIONS  AND  CODE  OF
PRACTICE  FOR  ROAD  BRIDGES
INTRODUCTION
The brief history of the Bridge Code given in the Introduction to Section I “General 
Features of Design” generally applies to Section II also. The draft of Section II for “Loads 
and Stresses”, as discussed at Jaipur Session of the Indian Roads Congress in 1946, 
was considered further in a number of meetings of the Bridges Committee for finalisation. 
In the years 1957 and 1958, the work of finalisin the draft was pushed on vigorously by 
the Bridges Committee.
In the Bridges Committee meeting held at Bombay in August 1958, all the comments 
received till then on the different clauses of this Section were disposed off finally and a 
drafting Committee consisting of S/Shri  S.B. Joshi, K.K. Nambiar, K.F. Antia and S.K. 
Ghosh was appointed to work in conjunction with the officers of the Roads Wing of the 
Ministry for finalising this Section.
This Committee at its meeting held at New Delhi in September 1958 and later through 
correspondences finalized Section II of the Bridge Code, which was printed in 1958 and 
reprinted 1962 and 1963.
The Second Revision of Section II of the  IRC:6 Code (1954 edition) included all the 
amendments, additions and alterations made by the Bridges Specifications and Standards 
(BSS) Committee in their meetings held from time to time.
The Executive Committee of the Indian Roads Congress approved the publication of the 
third Revision in metric units in 1966.
The Fourth Revision of Section II of the Code (2000 Edition) included all the amendments, 
additions and alterations made by the BSS Committee in their meetings held from time to 
time and was reprinted in 2002 with Amendment No. 1 reprinted in 2004 with Amendment 
No. 2 and again reprinted in 2006 with Amendment Nos. 3,4 and 5.
The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee and the IRC Council at various 
meetings approved certain amendments viz. Amendments No. 6 of November 2006 
relating to Sub-Clauses 218.2, 222.5, 207.4 and Appendix-2,  Amendment No. 7 
of February 2007 relating to Sub-Clauses of 213.7, Note 4 of Appendix-I and 218.3, 
Amendment No. 8 of January 2008 relating to Sub-Clauses 214.2(a), 214.5.1.1 and 
214.5.2 and new Clause 212 on Wind load.

IRC: 6-2017
As approved by the BSS Committee and IRC Council in 2008, the Amendment No. 
9 of May 2009 incorporating changes to Clauses 202.3, 208, 209.7 and 218.5 and 
Combination of Loads for limit state design of bridges has been introduced in Appendix-3, 
apart from the new Clause 222 on Seismic Force for design of bridges. 
The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee in its meeting held on 26th October, 
2009 further approved certain modifications to Clause 210.1, 202.3, 205, Note below 
Clause 208, 209.1, 209.4, 209.7, 222.5.5, Table 8, Note below Table 8, 222.8, 222.9, 
Table 1 and deletion of Clause 213.8, 214.5.1.2 and Note below para 8 of Appendix-3. 
The Convenor of B-2 Committee was authorized to incorporate these modifications in 
the draft for Fifth Revision of IRC:6, in the light of the comments of some members. The 
Executive Committee, in its meeting held on 31st October, 2009, and the IRC Council in 
its 189th meeting held on 14th November, 2009 at Patna approved publishing of the Fifth 
Revision of IRC: 6. 
The 6th Revision of IRC: 6 includes all the amendments and errata published from 
time to time upto December, 2013. The revised edition of IRC was approved by the 
Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee in its meeting held on 06.01.2014 and 
Executive Committee meeting held on 09.01.2014 for publishing. 
The 7th revision of IRC: 6-2017, includes all amendments and errata published in Indian 
Highways up to March 2017. The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS) 
in its meeting held on 20 September, 2016 at IRC HQ New Delhi approved the draft 
IRC-6 (7th Revision) with the observations to fine-tune the title as “Loads and Loads 
Combination” instead of “Loads & Stresses” in order to bring the functional harmony 
of the code. The draft IRC-6 (7th Revision) approved by the BSS was placed to the 
Council in its meeting held on 26 September 2016 during the 209th Mid-term Council 
meet at Kumarakom (Kerela) and approved the document subject to the compliance to 
the observations of the learned members.

IRC: 6-2017
SCOPE 
The object of the Standard Specifications and Code of Practice is to establish a 
common procedure for the design and construction of road bridges in India. This 
publication is meant to serve as a guide to both the design engineer and the construction
engineer but compliance with the rules therein does not relieve them in any way of their
responsibility for the stability and soundness of the structure designed and erected by 
them. The design and construction of road bridges require an extensive and through 
knowledge of the science and technique involved and should be entrusted only to 
specially qualified engineers with adequate practical experience in bridge engineering 
and capable of ensuring careful execution of work. 
201 CLASSIFICATION 
201.1	
Road bridges and culverts shall be divided into classes according to the 
loadings they are designed to carry. 
IRC CLASS 70R LOADING: This loading is to be normally adopted on all roads on 
which permanent bridges and culverts are constructed. Bridges designed for Class 70R. 
Loading should be checked for Class A Loading also as under certain conditions, heavier 
stresses may occur under Class A Loading. 
IRC CLASS AA LOADING: This loading is to be adopted within certain municipal limits, 
in certain existing or contemplated industrial areas, in other specified areas, and along 
certain specified highways. Bridges designed for Class AA Loading should be checked 
for Class A Loading also, as under certain conditions, heavier stresses may occur under 
Class A Loading. 
IRC CLASS A LOADING: This loading is to be normally adopted on all roads on which 
permanent bridges and culverts are constructed. 
IRC CLASS B LOADING: This loading is to be normally adopted for timber bridges. 
IRC CLASS SPECIAL VEHICLE (SV) LOADING: This loading is to be adopted for 
design of new bridges in select corridors as may be decided by concerned authorities 
where passage of trailer vehicles carrying stator units, turbines, heavy equipment and 
machinery may occur occasionally. This loading represents a spectrum of special vehicles 
in the country and should be considered for inclusion in the design wherever applicable. 
For particulars of the above five types of loading, see Clause 204.

IRC: 6-2017
201.2	
Existing bridges which were not originally constructed or later strengthened 
to take one of the above specified I.R.C. Loadings will be classified by giving each a 
number equal to that of the highest standard load class whose effects it can safely 
withstand. 
Annex A gives the essential data regarding the limiting loads in each bridge’s class, and 
forms the basis for the classification of bridges. 
201.3	
Individual bridges and culverts designed to take electric tramways or other 
special loadings and not constructed to take any of the loadings described in Clause 201.1
shall be classified in the appropriate load class indicated in Clause 201.2. 
202 LOADS, FORCES AND LOAD EFFECTS

3.	 The wave forces shall be determined by suitable analysis considering 
drawing and inertia forces etc. on single structural members based on rational 
methods or model studies. In case of group of piles, piers etc., proximity 
effects shall also be considered.
	
4.	 For bridges built in grade or cross-fall, the bearings shall normally be set 
level by varying the thickness .of the plate situated between the upper 
face of the bearing and lower face of the beam or by any other suitable 
arrangement. However, where the bearings are required to be set parallel to

All members shall be designed to sustain safely most critical combination of 
various loads, forces and stresses that can co-exist and all calculations shall tabulate 
distinctly the various combinations of the above loads and stresses covered by the 
design. Besides temperature, effect of environment on durability shall be considered as 
per relevant codes. 
202.3	 	
Combination of Loads and Forces and Permissible Increase in Stresses 
The load combination shown in Table 1 shall be adopted for masonry and timber bridges 
for working out stresses in the members. The permissible increase of stresses in various 
members due to these combinations is also indicated therein. These combinations 
of forces are not applicable for working out base pressure on foundations for which 
provision made in relevant IRC Bridge Code shall be adopted. For calculating stresses in 
members using working stress method of design the load combination shown in Table 1
shall be adopted.
The load combination as shown in Annex B shall be adopted for limit state design approach.

1)	
*Where Snow Load is applicable, Clause 221 shall be referred for combination of snow load 
and live load 
	
2)	
Any load combination involving temperature, wind and/or earthquake acting independently 
or in combination, maximum permissible tensile stress in Prestressed Concrete Members 
shall be limited to the value as per relevant Code (IRC:112).
	
3)	
Use of fractional live load shown in Table 1 is applicable only when the design live load
given in Table 6 is considered. The structure must also be checked with no live load.
	
4)	
The gradient effect due to temperature is considered in the load combinations IIB and IIIB. 
The reduced live load (Q) is indicated as 0.5. Its effects (Fa, Fb and Fcf) are also shown as 
0.5, as 0.5 stands for the reduced live load to be considered in this case. However for Ff it is 
shown as 1, since it has effects of dead load besides reduced live load. Qim being a factor of 
live load as shown as 1. Whenever a fraction of live load 0.5 shown in the above Table under 
column Q is specified, the associated effects due to live load (Qim Fa, Fb, Ff and Fcf) shall be 
considered corresponding to the associated fraction of live load. When the gradient effect is 
considered, the effects, if any due to overall rise of fall of temperature of the structure shall 
also be considered.
	
5)	
Seismic effect during erection stage is reduced to half in load combination IX when 
construction phase does not exceed 5 years.
	
6)	
The load combinations (VIII and IX) relate to the construction stage of a new bridge. For 
repair, rehabilitation and retrofitting, the load combination shall be project-specific.

204.6	
Fatigue Load 
Movement of traffic on bridges causes fluctuating stresses, resulting into possible fatigue 
damage. The stress spectrum due to vehicular traffic depends on the composition of 
traffic, vehicle attributes i.e., gross vehicle weight, axle spacing and axle load, vehicle 
spacing, structural configuration of the bridge and dynamic effects. 
The truck defined in Fig. 7A shall be used for the fatigue life assessment of steel, 
concrete and composite bridges. The transverse wheel spacing and tyre arrangement 
of this truck shall be as per Fig. 7B. 50% of the impact factors mentioned in Clause 208 
shall be applied to this fatigue load. 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 122
======================================================================

IRC: 6-2017
The stress range resulting from the single passage of the fatigue load along the 
longitudinal direction of the bridge, shall be used for fatigue assessment with the fatigue 
load so positioned as to have worst effect on the detail or element of the bridge under 
consideration. The minimum clearance between outer edge of the wheel of the fatigue 
vehicle and roadway face of the kerb shall be 150 mm. 
For all types of bridges (i.e. Concrete, Steel or Composite) the fatigue check shall be 
carried out under frequent combination of Serviceability Limit State (SLS), with load 
factors for fatigue load, taken as equal to 1.0. For design for fatigue limit state, reference 
shall be made to. IRC:112 for Concrete bridges, IRC:24 for Steel bridges and IRC:22 for 
Steel Concrete Composite bridges. 
In absence of any specific provision in these codes, following number of cycles may be 
considered for fatigue assessment, depending upon the location of the bridge and the 
category of roads:
	
	
1) The bridges close to areas such as ports, heavy industries and mines and 
other areas, where generally heavy vehicles ply shall be designed for the 
stress induced due to 10 x 106 cycles.
	
	
2) Other bridges shall be designed for the stress induced due to 2 x 106 cycles. 
Bridges on rural roads need not be designed for fatigue.

shear force and torsion in longitudinal direction.
	
2)	 Table 8 is applicable for individually supported superstructure of multi-laned 
carriageway. In the case of separate sub-structure and foundations, the number 
of lanes supported by each of them is to be considered while working out the 
reduction percentage. In the case of combined sub-structure and foundations, 
the total number of lanes for both the carriageway is to be considered while 
working out the reduction percentage. 
206 FOOT OVER BRIDGE, FOOTWAY, KERB, RAILINGS, PARAPET 
AND CRASH BARRIERS 
The horizontal force specified for footway, kerb, railings, parapet and crash barriers in 
this section need not be considered for the design of main structural members of the 
bridge. However, the connection between kerb/railings/parapet, crash barrier and the 
deck should be adequately designed and detailed. 
206.1	
For all parts of bridge floors accessible only to pedestrians and animals and for 
all footways the loading shall be 400 kg/m2. For the design of foot over bridges the loading 
shall be taken as 500 kg/m2. Where crowd loads are likely to occur, such as, on bridges 
located near towns, which are either centres of pilgrimage or where large congregational 
fairs are held seasonally, the intensity of footway loading shall be increased from 400

for the case of entire carriageway being occupied by crowd load. 
206.2	
Kerbs, 0.6 m or more in width, shall be designed for the above loads and for a 
local lateral force of 750 kg per metre, applied horizontally at top of the kerb. If kerb width 
is less than 0.6 m, no live load shall be applied in addition to the lateral load specified 
above. 
206.3	
In bridges designed for any of the loadings described in Clause 204.1, the main 
girders, trusses, arches, or other members supporting the footways shall be designed for 
the following live loads per square metre for footway area, the loaded length of footway 
taken in each case being, such as, to produce the worst effects on the member under 
consideration: 
	
a)	 For effective span of 7.5 m or less, 400 kg/m2 or 500 kg/m2 as the case may be, 
based on Sub-Clause 206.1.

Each part of the footway shall be capable of resisting an accidental load of 4 
tonne, which shall be deemed to include impact, distributed over a contact area of 300 
mm in diameter. For limit state design, the accidental combination as per Table B.2 shall 
be followed. This provision need not be made where vehicles cannot mount the footway 
as in the case of a footway separated from the roadway by means of an insurmountable

The pedestrian/bicycle railings/parapets can be of a large variety of construction. The 
design loads for two basic types are given below:- 
i)	
Type	
:	
Solid/partially filled in parapet continuously cantilevering along full 
length from deck level
	
Loading	
:	
Horizontal and vertical load of 150 kg/m acting simultaneously on 
the top level of the parapet.
ii)	
Type	
:	
Frame type with discrete vertical posts cantilevering from the curb/
deck with minimum two rows of horizontal rails (third row bring the 
curb itself, or curb replaced by a low level 3rd rail). The rails may be 
simply supported or continuous over the posts
	
Loading	
:	
Each horizontal railing designed for horizontal and vertical load 
of 150 kg/m, acting simultaneously over the rail. The filler portion, 
supported between any two horizontal rails and vertical rails should 
be designed to resist horizontal load of 150 kg/m2. The posts to 
resist horizontal load of 150 kg/m X spacing between posts in 
metres acting on top of the post.

Crash Barriers 
Crash barriers are designed to withstand the impact of vehicles of certain weights at 
certain angle while travelling at the specified, speed as given in Table 9. They are 
expected to guide the vehicle back on the road while keeping the level of damage to 
vehicle as well as to the barriers within acceptable limits.

The crash barriers can be of rigid type, using cast-in-situ/precast reinforced concrete 
panels, or of flexible type, constructed using metallic cold-rolled and/or hot-rolled sections. 
The metallic type, called semi-rigid type, suffers large dynamic deflection of the order 
of 0.9 to 1.2 m due to impact, whereas the ‘rigid’ concrete type suffers comparatively 
negligible deflection. The efficacy of the two types of barriers is established on the basis 
of full-size tests carried out by the laboratories specializing in such testing. A certificate 
from such laboratory can be the only basis of acceptance of the semi-rigid type, in which 
case all the design details and construction details tested by the laboratory are to be 
followed without modifications and without changing relative strengths and positions of 
any of the connections and elements. 
For the rigid type of barrier, the same method is acceptable. However, in absence of testing/test 
certificate, the barrier shall be designed to resist loading appropriate to the designated level of 
containment using the equivalent static nominal loadings from Table 10.

A certificate from such laboratory can be the only basis of acceptance of the semi-rigid 
type, in which case all the design details and construction details tested by the laboratory 
are to be followed into without modifications and without changing relative strengths and 
positions of any of the connections and elements. 
For the rigid type of barrier, the same method is acceptable. However, in absence of 
testing/test certificate, the minimum design resistance shown in Table 10 should be built 
into the section.
206.7	
Vehicle barriers/pedestrian railing between footpath and carriageway 
Where considerable pedestrian traffic is expected, such as, in/near townships, rigid type 
of reinforced concrete crash barrier should be provided separating the vehicular traffic 
from the same. The design and construction details should be as per Clause 206.6. For 
any other type of rigid barrier, the strength should be equivalent to that of rigid RCC type. 
For areas of low intensity of pedestrian traffic, semi-rigid type of barrier, which suffers 
large deflections, can be adopted. 
207 Tramway Loading 
207.1	
When a road bridge carries tram lines, the live load due to the type of tram cars 
sketched in Fig. 8 shall be computed and shall be considered to occupy a 3 m width of 
roadway 
207.2	
A nose to tail sequence of the tram cars or any other sequence which produces 
the heaviest stresses shall be considered in the design. 
on outer face, both vertical and horizontal, shall not be less than 50% of that in the traffic 
face. Spacing of reinforcement bars on any face shall not exceed 200 mm.
	
viii)	If concrete barrier is used as a median divider, the reinforcement is required to be 
placed on both sides.
	
ix)	 For in-situ panels, the joint between panels shall extend from the top of the panel down 
to not more than 25mm above the level of paved surface.
	
x)	
Specialist literature may be referred for design of attachment systems and anchorages 
and their loading for precast concrete parapet panels.
	
xi)	 Equivalent static loading as given in Table-10 are also applicable to crash barrier 
supported on friction slabs and friction slab too can be designed for same static loading.

208  IMPACT 
208.1	
Provision for impact or dynamic action shall be made by an increment of the 
live load by an impact allowance expressed as a fraction or a percentage of the applied 
live load.
208.2	
For Class A or Class B Loading 
In the members of any bridge designed either for Class A or Class B loading (vide 
Clause 204.1), this impact percentage shall be determined from the curves indicated in 
Fig.9. The impact fraction shall be determined from the following equations which are 
applicable for spans between 3 m and 45 m 
	
	
i)	
Impact factor fraction for reinforced concrete bridges = 4.5
6 + L
	
	
ii)	
Impact factor fraction for steel bridges = 
9
13.5 + L
Where L is length in meters of the span as specified in Clause 208.5
208.3	
For Class AA Loading and Class 70R Loading
The value of the impact percentage shall be taken as follows:-
	
a)	 For spans less than 9 m 
	
	
For tracked vehicles	 :	
25 percent for spans upto 5 m linearly reducing to
10 percent for spans upto 9 m
	
	
For wheeled vehicles	 :	
25 Percent
	
b)	 For spans of 9 m or more
	
i) Reinforced Concrete Bridges 
	
   1) Tracked Vehicles	
:	
10 percent upto a span of 40 m and in accordance 
with the curve in Fig. 9 for spans in excess of 40 m
	
   2) Wheeled Vehicles	
:	
25 percent for spans upto 12 m and in accordance 
with the curve in Fig. 9 for spans in excess of 12 m.
	
ii) Steel Bridges 
	
   3) Tracked Vehicles	
:	
10 percent for all spans

No impact allowance shall be added to the footway loading specified in Clause 206.
208.5	
The span length to be considered for arriving at the impact percentages 
specified in Clause 208.2 and 208.3 shall be as follows:
	
a)	 For spans simply supported or continuous a) or for arches………….
	
	
the effective span on which the load is placed.
	
b)	 For bridges having cantilever arms (with & without) hinges/suspended 
spans)….….
	
	
the effective over hang of the cantilever arms reduced by 25 percent for loads 
on the cantilever arms.
Note: For individual members of a bridge, such as, a cross girder or deck slab, etc. the 
value of L mentioned in Clause 208.2 or the spans mentioned in Clause 208.3 
shall be the effective span of the member under consideration.

IRC: 6-2017
208.6	
In any bridge structure where there is a filling of not less than 0.6 m including 
the road crust, the impact percentage to be allowed in the design shall be assumed to 
be one-half of what is specified in Clauses 208.2 and 208.3.
208.7	
For calculating the pressure on the bearings and abutment cap/pier cap, full 
value of the appropriate impact percentage shall be allowed. But, for the design of piers 
abutments and structures, generally below the level of the top of the abutment cap/pier 
cap, the appropriate impact percentage shall be multiplied by the factor given below:
	
a)	 For calculating the pressure on the top 3 m of the
	
	
structure below the abutment cap/piercap	
:	 0.5
	
	
	
	
decreasing
	
	
	
	
uniformly to zero
	
b)	 For calculating the pressure on the portion of structure	
:	 Zero 
	
	
more than 3 m below the abutment cap/piercap
208.8	
In the design of members subjected to among other stresses, direct tension, 
such as, hangers in a bowstring girder bridge and in the design of member subjected 
to direct compression, such as, spandrel columns or walls in an open spandrel arch, 
the impact percentage shall be taken the same as that applicable to the design of the 
corresponding member or members of the floor system which transfer loads to the tensile 
or compressive members in question. 
208.9	
These clauses on impact do not apply to the design of suspension bridges 
and foot over bridges. In cable suspended bridges and in other bridges where live load 
to dead load ratio is high, the dynamic effects such as vibration and fatigue shall be 
considered. For long span foot over bridges (with frequency less than 5 Hz and 1.5 Hz in 
vertical and horizontal direction) the dynamic effects shall be considered, if necessary, 
for which specialist literature may be referred. 
209  WIND LOAD 
209.1	
This clause is applicable to normal span bridges with individual span length up 
to 150 m or for bridges with height of pier up to 100 m. For all other bridges including 
cable stayed bridges, suspension bridges and ribbon bridges specialist literature shall 
be used for computation of design wind load. 
209.1.1	 The wind pressure acting on a bridge depends on the geographical locations, 
the terrain of surrounding area, the fetch of terrain upwind of the site location,



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 122
======================================================================

IRC: 6-2017
the local topography, the height of bridge above the ground, horizontal dimensions and 
cross-section of bridge or its element under consideration. The maximum pressure is 
due to gusts that cause local and transient fluctuations about the mean wind pressure. 
All structures shall be designed for the wind forces as specified in Clause 209.3 and 
209.4. These forces shall be considered to act in such a direction that the resultant 
stresses in the member under consideration are maximum. 
In addition to applying the prescribed loads in the design of bridge elements, stability 
against overturning, uplift and sliding due to wind shall be considered. 
209.2	
The wind speed at the location of bridge shall be based on basic wind speed 
map as shown in Fig. 10. The intensity of wind force shall be based on hourly mean wind 
speed and pressure as shown in Table 12. The hourly mean wind speed and pressure 
values given in Table 12 corresponds to a basic wind speed of 33 m/s, return period of 
100 years, for bridges situated in plain terrain and terrain with obstructions, with a flat 
topography. The hourly mean wind pressure shall be appropriately modified depending 
on the location of bridge for other basic wind speed as shown in Fig. 10 and used for 
design (see notes below Table 12).

Notes : 
	
1)	 Intermediate values may be obtained by linear interpolation.
	
2)	 Plain terrain refers to open terrain with no obstruction or with very well scattered 
obstructions having height upto 10 m. Terrain with obstructions refers to a terrain 
with numerous closely spaced structures, forests or trees upto 10 m in height with 
few isolated tall structures or terrain with large number of high closed spaced 
obstruction like structures, trees forests etc.
	
3)	 For other values of basic wind speed as indicated in Fig. 10, the hourly mean wind 
speed shall be obtained by multiplying the corresponding wind speed value by the 
ratio of basic wind speed at the location of bridge to the value corresponding to 
Table 12, (i.e., 33 m/sec.)
	
4)	 The hourly mean wind pressure at an appropriate height and terrain shall be 
obtained by multiplying the corresponding pressure value for base wind speed as 
indicated in Table 12 by the ratio of square of basic wind speed at the location of 
wind to square of base wind speed corresponding to Table 12 (i.e., 33 m/sec).
	
5)	 If the topography (hill, ridge escarpment or cliff) at the structure site can cause 
acceleration or funneling of wind, the wind pressure shall be further increased by 
20 percent as stated in Note 4.
	
6)	 For construction stages, the hourly mean wind pressure shall be taken as 70 
percent of the value calculated as stated in Notes 4 and 5. 
	
7)	 For the design of foot over bridges in the urban situations and in plain terrain, a 
minimum horizontal wind load of 1.5 kN/m2 (150 kg/m2) and 2 kN/m2 (200 kg/m2) 
respectively shall be considered to be acting on the frontal area of the bridge. 
209.3	
Design Wind Force on Superstructure 
209.3.1	 The superstructure shall be designed for wind induced horizontal forces (acting 
in the transverse and longitudinal direction) and vertical loads acting simultaneously. 
The assumed wind direction shall be perpendicular to longitudinal axis for a straight 
structure or to an axis chosen to maximize the wind induced effects for a structure 
curved in plan. 
209.3.2	 The transverse wind force on a bridge superstructure shall be estimated as 
specified in Clause 209.3.3 and acting on the area calculated as follows:
	
a)	 For a deck structure:
	
	
The area of the structure as seen in elevation including the floor system 
and railing, less area of perforations in hand railing or parapet walls shall be 
considered. For open and solid parapets, crash barriers and railings, the solid 
area in normal projected elevation of the element shall be considered.
	
b)	 For truss structures:
	
	
Appropriate area as specified in Annex C shall be taken.

c)	 For construction stages:
	
	
The area at all stages of construction shall be the appropriate unshielded solid 
area of structure. 
209.3.3	 The transverse wind force FT (in N) shall be taken as acting at the centroids of 
the appropriate areas and horizontally and shall be estimated from: 
FT = Pz x A1 x G x CD 
where, Pz is the hourly mean wind pressure in N/m2 (see Table 12) , A1 is the solid area 
in m2 (see Clause 209.3.2), G is the gust factor and CD is the drag coefficient depending 
on the geometric shape of bridge deck. 
For highway bridges upto a span of 150 m, which are generally not sensitive to dynamic 
action of wind, gust factor shall be taken as 2.0. 
The drag coefficient for slab bridges with width to depth ratio of cross-section, i.e b/d≥10 
shall be taken as 1.1. 
For bridge decks supported by single beam or box girder, CD shall be taken as 1.5 for b/d 
ratio of 2 and as 1.3 if b/d ≥ 6. For intermediate b/d ratios CD shall be interpolated. For 
deck supported by two or more beams or box girders, where the ratio of clear distance 
between the beams of boxes to the depth does not exceed 7, CD for the combined 
structure shall be taken as 1.5 times CD for the single beam or box. 
For deck supported by single plate girder it shall be taken as 2.2. When the deck is 
supported by two or more plate girders, for the combined structure CD shall be taken as 
2(1+c/20d), but not more than 4, where c is the centre-to-centre distance of adjacent 
girders, and d is the depth of windward girder. 
For truss girder superstructure the drag coefficients shall be derived as given in Annex C.
For other type of deck cross-sections CD shall be ascertained either from wind tunnel 
tests or, if available, for similar type of structure, specialist literature shall be referred to. 
209.3.4	 The longitudinal force on bridge superstructure FL (in N) shall be taken as 25 
percent and 50 percent of the transverse wind load as calculated as per Clause 209.3.3 
for beam/box/plate girder bridges and truss girder bridges respectively.

linearly from zero at the point of deepest scour to the square of the maximum velocity at 
the free surface of water. The maximum velocity for the purpose of this sub-clause shall

where,  V  is the mean velocity.
210.4	
When the current strikes the pier at an angle, the velocity of the current shall 
be resolved into two components — one parallel and the other normal to the pier.
	
	
a) The pressure parallel to the pier shall be determined as indicated in Clause 
210.2 taking the velocity as the component of the velocity of :the current in 
a direction parallel to the pier.
	
	
b) The pressure of the current, normal to the pier and acting on the area of the 
side elevation of the pier, shall be calculated similarly taking the velocity as 
the component of the velocity of the current in a direction normal to the pier, 
and the constant K as 1.5, except in the case of circular piers where the 
constant shall be taken as 0.66. 
210.5	
To provide against possible variation of the direction of the current from the 
direction assumed in the design, allowance shall be made in the design of piers for an extra 
variation in the current direction of 20 degrees that is to say, piers intended to be parallel 
to the direction of current shall be designed for a variation of 20 degrees from the normal

direction of current and piers originally intended to be inclined at 0 degree to the direction 
of the current shall be designed for a current direction inclined at (20±0) degrees to the 
length of the pier. 
210.6	
In case of a bridge having a pucca floor or having an inerodible bed, the effect 
of cross-currents shall in no case be taken as less than that of a static force due to a 
difference of head of 250 mm between the opposite faces of a pier. 
210.7	
When supports are made with two or more piles or trestle columns, spaced 
closer than three times the width of piles/columns across the direction of flow, the group 
shall be treated as a solid rectangle of the same overall length and width and the value of 
K taken as 1.25 for calculating pressures due to water currents, both parallel and normal 
to the pier. If such piles/columns are braced, then the group should be considered as a 
solid pier, irrespective of the spacing of the columns. 
211 LONGITUDINAL FORCES 
211.1	
In all road bridges, provision shall be made for longitudinal forces arising from 
any one or more of the following causes:
	
a)	 Tractive effort caused through acceleration of the driving wheels;
	
b)	 Braking effect resulting from the application of the brakes to braked wheels; and
	
c)	 Frictional resistance offered to the movement of free bearings due to change of 
temperature or any other cause.
Note : Braking effect is invariably greater than the tractive effort. 
211.2	
The braking effect on a simply supported span or a continuous unit of spans or 
on any other type of bridge unit shall be assumed to have the following value: 
	
a)	 In the case of a single lane or a two lane bridge : twenty percent of the first 
train load plus ten percent of the load of the succeeding trains or part thereof, 
the train loads in one lane only being considered for the purpose of this sub- 
clause. Where the entire first train is not on the full span, the braking force 
shall be taken as equal to twenty percent of the loads actually on the span or 
continuous unit of spans.
	
b)	 In the case of bridges having more than two-lanes: as in (a) above for the 
first two lanes plus five percent of the loads on the lanes in excess of two.

IRC: 6-2017
211.3	
The force due to braking effect shall be assumed to act along a line parallel to the 
roadway and 1.2 m above it. While transferring the force to the bearings, the change in the 
vertical reaction at the bearings should be taken into account. 
211.4	
The distribution of longitudinal horizontal forces among bridge supports is 
effected by the horizontal deformation of bridges, flexing of the supports and rotation of the 
foundations. For spans resting on stiff supports, the distribution may be assumed as given 
below in Clause 211.5. For spans resting on flexible supports, distribution of horizontal 
forces may be carried out according to procedure given below in Clause 211.6.

fixed bearing shall be designed to withstand the full seismic and design braking/
tractive force.

full seismic and design braking/tractive force. 
211.6	
Simply Supported and Continuous Spans on Flexible Supports 
211.6.1	 Shear rating of a support is the horizontal force required to move the top of the support 
through a unit distance taking into account horizontal deformation of the bridges, flexibility of 
the support and rotation of the foundation. The distribution of ‘applied’ longitudinal horizontal 
forces (e.g., braking, seismic, wind etc.) depends solely on shear ratings of the supports and 
may be estimated in proportion to the ratio of individual shear ratings of a support to the sum 
of the shear ratings of all the supports.



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 122
======================================================================
47
IRC: 6-2017
211.6.2	 The distribution of self-induced horizontal force caused by deck movement 
(owing to temperature, shrinkage, creep, elastic shortening, etc.) depends not only on 
shear ratings of the supports but also on the location of the ‘zero’ movement point in 
the deck. The shear rating of the supports, the distribution of applied and self-induced 
horizontal force and the determination of the point of zero movement may be made as per 
recognized theory for which reference may be made to publications on the subjects. 
211.7	
The effects of braking force on bridge structures without bearings, such as, 
arches, rigid frames, etc., shall be calculated in accordance with approved methods of 
analysis of indeterminate structures. 
211.8	
The effects of the longitudinal forces and all other horizontal forces should be 
calculated upto a level where the resultant passive earth resistance of the soil below the 
deepest scour level (floor level in case of a bridge having pucca floor) balances these 
forces. 
212  CENTRIFUGAL FORCES 
212.1	
Where a road bridge is situated on a curve, all portions of the structure affected 
by the centrifugal action of moving vehicles are to be proportioned to carry safely the 
stress induced by this action in addition to all other stress to which they may be subjected. 
212.2	
The centrifugal force shall be determined from the following equation:
C = 
2
127
WV
R
where,
	
C = 
Centrifugal force acting normally to the traffic (1) at the point of action of the wheel 
loads or (2) uniformly distributed over every metre length on which a uniformly 
distributed load acts, in tonnes. 
	
W	 =	
Live load (1) in case of wheel loads, each wheel load being considered as acting 
over the ground contact length specified in Clause 204, in tonnes, and (2) in case 
of a uniformly distributed live load, in tonnes per linear metre. 
	
V	 =	
The design speed of the vehicles using the bridge in km per hour, and
	
R	 =	
The radius of curvature in metres.
212.3	
The centrifugal force shall be considered to act at a height of 1.2 m above the 
level of the carriageway. 



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 122
======================================================================
48
IRC: 6-2017
212.4	
No increase for impact effect shall be made on the stress due to centrifugal 
action. 
212.5	
The overturning effect of the centrifugal force on the structure as a whole shall 
also be duly considered. 
213  BUOYANCY 
213.1	
In the design of abutments, especially those of submersible bridges, the effects 
of buoyancy shall also be considered assuming that the fill behind the abutments has 
been removed by scour. 
213.2	
To allow for full buoyancy, a reduction shall be made in the gross weight of the 
member affected by reducing its density by the density of the displaced water.
Note: 
	
1)	 The density of water may be taken as 1.0 t/m3
	
2)	 For artesian condition, HFL or actual water head, whichever is higher, shall be 
considered for calculating the uplift. 
213.3	
In the design of submerged masonry or concrete structures, the buoyancy 
effect through pore pressure may be limited to 15 percent of full buoyancy. 
213.4	
In case of submersible bridges, the full buoyancy effect on the superstructure 
shall be taken into consideration. 
214  EARTH PRESSURE 
214.1	
Lateral Earth Pressure 
Structure designed to retain earth fills shall be proportioned to withstand pressure 
calculated in accordance with any rational theory. Coulomb’s theory shall be acceptable 
for non-cohesive soils. For cohesive soil Coulomb’s theory is applicable with Bell’s 
correction. For calculating the earth pressure at rest Rankine’s theory shall be used. 
Earth retaining structures shall, however, be designed to withstand a horizontal pressure 
not less than that exerted by a fluid weighing 480 kg/m3 unless special methods are 
adopted to eliminate earth pressure. 
The provisions made under this clause are not applicable for design of reinforced soil 
structures, diaphragm walls and sheet piles etc., for which specialist literature shall be 
referred.

bridge temperature. Over a prescribed period there will be a minimum and a 
maximum, together with a range of effective bridge temperature, resulting in 
loads and/or load effects within the bridge due to:

Temperature Differences 
Effect of temperature difference within the superstructure shall be derived from positive 
temperature differences which occur when conditions are such that solar radiation 
and other effects cause a gain in heat through the top surface of the superstructure. 
Conversely, reverse temperature differences are such that heat is lost from the top 
surface of the bridge deck as a result of re-radiation and other effects. Positive and 
reverse temperature differences for the purpose of design of concrete bridge decks shall 
be assumed as shown in Fig. 16a. These design provisions are applicable to concrete

216  SECONDARY  EFFECTS 
216.1	
a) Steel Structures: Secondary effects are additional effects brought into play 
due to the eccentricity of connections, floor beam loads applied at intermediate 
points in a panel, cross girders being connected away from panel points, lateral 
wind loads on the end-posts of through girders etc., and effects due to the 
movement of supports 
	
	
b) Reinforced Concrete Structures: Secondary effects are additional effects 
brought into play due either to the movement of supports or to the deformations 
in the geometrical shape of the structure or its member, resulting from causes, 
such as, rigidity of end connection or loads applied at intermediate points of 
trusses or restrictive shrinkage of concrete floor beams. 
216.2	
All bridges shall be designated and constructed in a manner such that the 
secondary effects are reduced to a minimum and they shall be allowed for in the design.
216.3	
For reinforced concrete members, the shrinkage coefficient for purposes of 
design may be taken as 2 X 10-4.
217  ERECTION  EFFECTS  AND  CONSTRUCTION  LOADS 
217.1	
The effects of erection as per actual loads based on the construction programme 
shall be accounted for in the design. This shall also include the condition of one span 
being completed in all respects and the adjacent span not in position. However, one 
span dislodged condition need not be considered in the case of slab bridge not provided 
with bearings.
217.2	
Construction loads are those which are incident upon a structure or any of its 
constituent components during the construction of the structures. 
A detailed construction procedure associated with a method statement shall be drawn 
up during design and considered in the design to ensure that all aspects of stability and 
strength of the structure are satisfied. 
217.3	
Examples of Typical Construction Loadings are given below. However, each 
individual case shall be investigated in complete detail.
Examples:
	
	
a)	 Loads of plant and equipment including the weight handled that might be 
incident on the structure during construction.
	
	
b)	 Temporary super-imposed loading caused by storage of construction 
material on a partially completed a bridge deck.

of modules that may be required for cantilever segmental construction of a 
bridge. 
	
	
d)	 Loading on individual beams and/or completed deck system due to travelling 
of a launching truss over such beams/deck system.

as, unequal gust load and for special type of construction, such as, long 
span bridges specialist literature may be referred to.

e)	 Bridges having any of the special seismic resistant features such as seismic 
isolators, dampers etc.
	
	
f)	
Bridges using innovative structural arrangements and materials.
	
	
g)	 Bridge in near field regions 
	
	
	
In all seismic zones, areas covered within 10 km from the known active 
faults are classified as ‘Near Field Regions’. The information about the 
active faults should be sought by bridge authorities for projects situated 
within 100 km of known epicenters as a part of preliminary investigations 
at the project preparation stage. 
	
	
	
For all bridges located within ‘Near Field Regions’, except those exempted 
in Clause 218.1.1, special investigations should be carried out. 
Notes for special investigations:
	
	
1)	 Special investigations should include aspects such as need for site 
specific spectra, independency of component motions, spatial variation of 
excitation, need to include soil-structure interaction, suitable methods of 
structural analysis in view of geometrical and structural non-linear effects, 
characteristics and reliability of seismic isolation and other special seismic 
resistant devices, etc.
	
	
2)	 Site specific spectrum, wherever its need is established in the special 
investigation, shall be used, subject to the minimum values specified for 
relevant seismic zones, given in Fig. 17.
218.1.3	 Masonry and plain concrete arch bridges with span more than 10 m shall be 
avoided in Zones IV and V and in ‘Near Field Region’. 
218.2	
Seismic Zones

Components of Seismic Motion 
The characteristics of seismic ground motion expected at any location depend upon 
the magnitude of earthquake, depth of focus, distance of epicenter and characteristics 
of the path through which the seismic wave travels. The random ground motion can be 
resolved in three mutually perpendicular directions. The components are considered to 
act simultaneously, but independently and their method of combination is described in 
Clause 218.4. Two horizontal components are taken as of equal magnitude, and vertical 
component is taken as two third of horizontal component. 
In zones IV and V the effects of vertical components shall be considered for all elements 
of the bridge. 
The effect of vertical component may be omitted for all elements in zones II and III, 
except for the following cases:
	
	
a)	 prestressed concrete decks
	
	
b)	 bearings and linkages
	
	
c)

Combination of Component Motions 
	
	
1.	
The seismic forces shall be assumed to come from any horizontal direction. 
For this purpose two separate analyses shall be performed for design 
seismic forces acting along two orthogonal horizontal directions. The design 
seismic force resultants (i.e. axial force, bending moments, shear forces, 
and torsion) at any cross-section of a bridge component resulting from the 
analyses in the two orthogonal horizontal directions shall be combined as 
given in Fig.18
	
	
	
a) ± r1 ± 0.3r2
	
	
	
b) ± 0.3r1 ± r2

resultants at any cross-section of a bridge component shall be combined

218.5	
Computation of Seismic Response 
Following methods are used for computation of seismic response depending upon the 
complexity of the structure and the input ground motion. 
	
	
1)	 For most of the bridges, elastic seismic acceleration method is adequate. 
In this method, the first fundamental mode of vibration is calculated and 
the corresponding acceleration is read from Fig. 19. This acceleratons is 
applied to all parts of the bridge for calculation of forces as per Clause 
218.5.1.
	
	
2)	 Elastic Response Spectrum Method: This is a general method, suitable for 
more complex structural systems (e. g. continuous bridges, bridges with 
large difference in pier heights, bridges which are curved in plan, etc.), in 
which dynamic analysis of the structure is performed to obtain the first as 
well as higher modes of vibration and the forces obtained for each mode 
by use of response spectrum from Fig. 19 and Clause 218.5.1. These 
modal forces are combined by following appropriate combination rules to 
arrive at the design forces. Reference is made to specialist literature for 
the same.

i)	
The seismic force due to live load shall not be considered when acting in 
the direction of traffic, but shall be considered in the direction perpendicular 
to the traffic.

iii)	 The vertical seismic force shall be calculated using 20 percent of live load 
(excluding impact factor). 
Note :	
The reduced percentages of live loads are applicable only for calculating the 
magnitude of seismic design force and are based on the assumption that only 
20 percent of the live load is present over the bridge at the time of earthquake. 
218.5.3	 Water current and depth of scour 
The depth of scour under seismic condition to be considered for design shall be 0.9 
times the maximum scour depth. The flood level for calculating hydrodynamic force and 
water current force is to be taken as average of yearly maximum design floods. For river 
bridges, average may preferably be based on consecutive 7 years’ data, or on local 
enquiry in the absence of such data. 
218.5.4	 Hydrodynamic and earth pressure forces under seismic condition 
In addition to inertial forces arising from the dead load and live load, hydrodynamic forces 
act on the submerged part of the structure and are transmitted to the foundations. Also, 
additional earth pressures due to earthquake act on the retaining portions of abutments. 
For values of these loads reference is made to IS 1893. These forces shall be considered 
in the design of bridges in zones IV and V. 
The modified earth pressure forces described in the preceding paragraph need not be 
considered on the portion of the structure below scour level and on other components, 
such as wing walls and return walls. 
218.5.5	 Design forces for elements of structures and use of response reduction factor
The forces on various members obtained from the elastic analyses of bridge structure 
are to be divided by Response Reduction Factor given in Table 20 before combining 
with other forces as per load combinations given in Table 1. The allowable increase in 
permissible stresses should be as per Table 1.

v)	
Bearings and connections shall be designed to resist the lesser of the 
following forces, i.e., (a) design seismic forces obtained by using the 
response reduction factors given in Table 20 and (b) forces developed due 
to over strength moment when hinge is formed in the substructure. 
	
	
vi)	 When connectors and stoppers are designed as additional safety measures 
in the event of failure of bearings, R value specified in Table 20 for 
appropriate substructure shall be adopted 
218.6	
Fully Embedded Portions 
For embedded portion of foundation at depths exceeding 30 m below scour level, the 
seismic force due to foundation mass may be computed using design seismic coefficient 
equal to 0.5Ah. 
For portion of foundation between the scour level and upto 30 m depth, the seismic 
force due to that portion of foundation mass may be computed using seismic coefficient 
obtained by linearly interpolating between Ah at scour level and 0.5Ah at a depth 30 m 
below scour level 
218.7	
Liquefaction 
In loose sands and poorly graded sands with little or no fines, the vibrations due to 
earthquake may cause liquefaction, or excessive total and differential settlements. 
Founding bridges on such sands should be avoided unless appropriate methods of 
compaction or stabilization are adopted. Alternatively, the foundations should be taken 
deeper below liquefiable layers, to firm strata. Reference should be made to the specialist 
literature for analysis of liquefaction potential. 
218.8	
Foundation Design 
For design of foundation, the seismic force after taking into account of appropriate R 
factor should be taken as 1.35 and 1.25 times the forces transmitted to it by concrete and 
steel substructure respectively, so as to provide sufficient margin to cover the possible 
higher forces transmitted by substructure arising out of its over strength. However, these 
over strength factors are not applicable when R=1. Also, the dynamic increment of earth 
pressure due to seismic need not be enhanced.

Mandatory Provisions 
	
	
i)	
In zones IV and V, to prevent dislodgement of superstructure, “reaction 
blocks” (additional safety measures in the event of failure of bearings) 
or other types of seismic arresters shall be provided and designed for 
the seismic force (Feq/R). Pier and abutment caps shall be generously 
dimensioned, to prevent dislodgement of severe ground—shaking. The 
examples of seismic features shown in Figs. 20 to 22 are only indicative 
and suitable arrangements will have to be worked out in specific cases.
	
	
ii)	
To improve the performance of bridges during earthquakes, the bridges 
in Seismic Zones Ill, IV and V may be specifically detailed for ductility for 
which IRC:112 shall be referred. 
Recommended Provisions 
	
	
i)	
In order to mitigate the effects of earthquake forces described above, 
special seismic devices such as Shock Transmission Units, Base Isolation, 
Seismic Fuse, Lead Plug, etc., may be provided based on specialized 
literature, international practices, satisfactory testing etc.
	
	
ii)	
Continuous superstructure (with fewer number of bearings and expansion 
joints) or integral bridges (in which the substructure or superstructure are 
made joint less, i.e. monolithic), if not unsuitable otherwise, can possibly 
provide high ductility leading to correct behavior during earthquake.
	
	
iii)	 Where elastomeric bearings are used, a separate system of arrester 
control in both directions may be introduced to cater to seismic forces on 
the bearing.

219  BARGE  IMPACT  ON  BRIDGES 
219.1 General
1)	
Bridges crossing navigable channels of rivers, creeks and canals as well as the 
shipping channels in port areas and open seas shall be provided with “navigation 
spans” which shall be specially identified and marked to direct the waterway traffic 
below them. The span arrangement, horizontal clearances between the inner faces 
of piers within the width of the navigational channel, vertical clearances above the 
air-draft of the ships/barges upto soffit of deck and minimum depth of water in the 
channel below the maximum laden draft of the barges shall be decided based on 
the classification of waterways as per Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) or 
the concerned Ports and Shipping Authorities. 
2)	
Bridge components located in a navigable channel of rivers and canals shall be 
designed for barge impact force due to the possibility of barge accidentally colliding 
with the structure.
3)	
For bridges located in sea, and in waterways under control of ports, the bridge 
components may have to be designed for vessel collision force, for which the details 
of the ships/barges shall be obtained from the concerned authority. Specialist 
literature may be referred for the magnitudes of design forces and appropriate 
design solutions.
4)	
The design objective for bridges is to minimize the risk of the structural failure of a 
bridge component due to collision with a plying barge in a cost-effective manner and 
at the same time reduce the risk of damage to the barge and resulting environmental 
pollution, if any. Localized repairable damage of substructure and superstructure 
components is permitted provided that:
	
	
a)	 Damaged structural components can be inspected and repaired in a 
relatively cost effective manner not involving detailed investigation, and 
	
	
b)	 Sufficient ductility and redundancy exist in the remaining structure to 
prevent consequential progressive collapse, in the event of impact. 
5)	
The Indian waterways have been classified in 7 categories by IWAI. The vessel 
displacement tonnage for each of the class of waterway is shown in Table 21. 
Barges and their configurations which are likely to ply, their dimensions, the Dead 
Weight Tonnage (DWT), the minimum dimensions of waterway in lean section, and 
minimum clearance requirements are specified by IWAI. The latest requirements 
(2009) are shown in Annex E.

Note: The total displacement tonnage of Self Propelled Vehicle (SPV) equals the weight 
of the barge when empty plus the weight of the ballast and cargo (DWT) being 
carried by the barge. The displacement tonnage for barge tows shall equal the 
displacement tonnage of the tug/tow barge plus the combined displacement of 
number of barges in the length of the tow as shown in Annex E.
6)	
In determining barge impact loads, consideration shall also be given to the 
relationship of the bridge to :
	
	
a)	 Waterway geometry.
	
	
b)	 Size, type, loading condition of barge using the waterway, taking into 
account the available water depth, and width of the navigable channel. 
	
	
c)	
Speed of barge and direction, with respect to water current velocities in the 
period of the year when barges are permitted to ply.
	
	
d)	 Structural response of the bridge to collision.
7)	
In navigable portion of waterways where barge collision is anticipated, structures 
shall be :
	
	
a)	 Designed to resist barge collision forces, or
	
	
b)	 Adequately protected by designed fenders, dolphins, berms, artificial 
islands, or other sacrificial devices designed to absorb the energy of 
colliding vessels or to redirect the course of a vessel, or
	
	
c)	
A combination of (a) and (b) above, where protective measures absorb 
most of the force and substructure is designed for the residual force.
	
8)	 In non-navigable portion of the waterways, the possibility of smaller barges 
using these portions and likely to cause accidental impact shall be examined 
from consideration of the available draft and type of barges that ply on the 
waterway. In case such possibility exists, the piers shall be designed to resist a 
lower force of barge impact caused by the smaller barges as compared to the 
navigational span.
	
9)	 For navigable waterways which have not been classified by IWAI, but where 
barges are plying, one of Class from I & VI should be chosen as applicable, 
based on the local survey of crafts plying in the waterway. Where reliable data 
is not available minimum Class-I shall be assigned.

Design Barge Dimensions 
A design barge shall be selected on the basis of classification of the waterway. The 
barge characteristics for any waterway shall be obtained from IWAI (Ref. Annex E). 
The dimensions of the barge should be taken from the survey of operating barge. Where 
no reliable information is available, the same may be taken from Fig. 23

Checking in Dime Iona! Clearances for Navigation and Location of Barge 
Impact Force 
Fig. 24	 shows e position of bridge foundations and piers as well as the position of the 
barge in relation to the actual water level. The minimum and maximum water levels 
within which barges are permitted to ply are shown schematically. These levels should 
be decided by the river authorities or by authority controlling the navigation. 
The minimum navigable level will be controlled by the minimum depth of water needed 
for the plying of barges. The maximum level may be determined by the maximum water 
velocity in which the barges may safely ply and by the available vertical clearances 
below the existing (or planned) structures across the navigable water.

For checking Minimum Clearance below Bridge Deck :
	
a)	 (HG+(DV-Dmin) : is maximum projection of the highest barge component above 
actual water level (e.g. including projecting equipment over top of cabin like 
radar mast).
	
b)	 Highest Level of Barge : (HG+(DV-Dmin) + maximum permitted water level for 
navigation (This may be decided by water current velocity). Minimum specified 
clearance should be checked with reference to this level and lowest soffit level 
of bridge.
2)	
For determining lowest position of barge with respect to bridge pier.
	
a)	
Maximum depth of submergence = Dmax= Maximum Water Draft.
	
b)	
Minimum level permitted for navigation = Level at which minimum clearance required 
for navigation between bed level and lowest part of barge (at Dmax) is available.
3)	
For determining range of pier elevations between which barge impact can take places anywhere :
	
a)	
Highest Level = Maximum water level permitted for navigation + (DB-Dmin).

219.4	
Design Barge Speed 
The speed at which the barge collides against the components of a bridge depends 
upon to the barge transit speed within the navigable channel limits, the distance to the 
location of the bridge element from the centre line of the barge transit path and the barge 
length overall (LOA). This information shall be collected from the IWAI. In absence of any 
data, a design speed of 6 knots (i.e. 3.1 m/sec) for unladen barge and 4 knots (i.e. 2.1 
m/sec) for laden barge may be assumed for design for both upstream and downstream 
directions of traffic.

KE	 =	 Barge Collision Energy (N-m)
	
CH = Hydrodynamic coefficient
	
    	 =	 1.05 to 1.25 for Barges depending upon the under keel clearance available.
 
 
● 
In case underkeel clearance is more than 0.5 x Draft, CH=1.05;
 
 
● 
In case underkeel clearance is less than 0.1 x Draft, CH = 1.25.
 
 
● 
For any intermediate values of underkeel clearance, linear interpolation 
shall be done.
Note : The formula of kinetic energy is a standard kinetic energy, equation KE = 1/2 
MV2/1 Ch Mass, M = w/g where W is the weight of barge and CH is the hydro 
dynamic effect representing mass of the water moving together with the barge. 
Substitution value in proper units in K.E. formula yields the equation given in the 
draft.

where,

219.7	
Barge Collision Impact Force, ‘PB’
The barge collision impact force shall be determined based on the following equations:
For aB<100 mm, PB = 6.0 x 104 x (aB), in N
For aB ≥ 100 mm, PB = 6.0 x 106 + 1600 x (aB), in N
219.8	
Location & Magnitude of Impact Force in Substructure & Foundation, ‘PB’ 
All components of the substructure, exposed to physical contact by any portion of the 
design barge’s hull or bow, shall be designed to resist the applied loads. The bow overhang, 
rake, or flair distance of barges shall be considered in determining the portions of the 
substructure exposed to contact by the barge. Crushing of the barge’s bow, causing 
contact with any setback portion of the substructure shall also be considered. 
Some of the salient barge dimensions to be checked while checking for the navigational 
clearances are as follows.
The design impact force for the above cases is to be applied as a vertical line load 
equally distributed along the barge’s bow depth, H2 defined with respect to the reference 
water level as shown in Fig.25. The barge’s bow is considered to be raked forward in 
determining the potential contact area of the impact force on the substructure. 
219.9	
Protection of Substructure 
Protection may be provided to reduce or to eliminate the exposure of bridge substructures 
to barge collision by physical protection systems, including fenders, pile cluster, pile-
supported structures, dolphins, islands, and combinations thereof. 
Severe damage and/or collapse of the protection system may be permitted, 
provided that the protection system stops the Barge prior to contact with the pier or 
redirects the barge away from the pier. In such cases, the bridge piers need not be 



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 122
======================================================================

IRC: 6-2017
designed for Barge Impact. Specialist literature shall be referred for design of protection 
structures. 
Flexible fenders or other protection system attached to the substructure help to limit the 
damage to the barge and the substructure by absorbing part of impact (kinetic energy of 
collision). For the design of combined system of pier and protection system, the design 
forces as obtained from Clause 219.7 shall be used in absence of rigorous analysis. 
219:10	 Load Combination 
The barge collision load shall be considered as an accidental load and load combination 
shall conform to the provisions of Annexure B. Barge impact load shall be considered 
only under Ultimate Limit State. For working load/allowable stress condition, allowable 
stress may be increased by 50 percent. 
The probability of the simultaneous occurrence of a barge collision together with the 
maximum flood need not be considered. For the purpose of load combination of barge 
collision, the maximum flood level may be taken as the mean annual flood level of previous 
20 years, provided that the permissible maximum current velocities for the barges to ply 
are not exceeded. In such event maximum level may be calculated backward from the 
allowable current velocities. The maximum level of scour below this flood level shall be 
calculated by scour formula in Clause 703.3.1 of IRC: 78. However, no credit for scour 
shall be taken for verifying required depth for allowing navigation. 
220 SNOW LOAD 
The snow load of 500 kg/m3 where applicable shall be assumed to act on the bridge 
deck while combining with live load as given below. Both the conditions shall be checked 
independently:
	
a)	 A  snow accumulation upto 0.25 m over the deck shall be taken into consideration, 
while designing the structure for wheeled vehicles.
	
b)	 A  snow accumulation upto 0.50 m over the deck shall be taken into consideration, 
while designing the structure for tracked vehicles.
	
c)	 In case of snow accumulation exceeding 0.50 m, design shall be based on the 
maximum recorded snow accumulation (based on the actual site observation, 
including the effect of variation in snow density). No live load shall be considered 
to act along with this snow load.

221 VEHICLE COLLISION LOADS ON SUPPORTS OF BRIDGES, FLYOVER 
SUPPORTS AND FOOT OVER BRIDGES 
221.1	
General 
221.1.1	 Bridge piers of wall type, columns or the frames built in the median or in the 
vicinity of the carriageway supporting the superstructure shall be designed to withstand 
vehicle collision loads. The effect of collision load shall also be considered on the 
supporting elements, such as, foundations and bearings. For multilevel carriageways, 
the collision loads shall be considered separately for each level. 
221:1.2	 The effect of collision load shall not be considered on abutments or on the 
structures separated from the edge of the carriageway by a minimum distance of 4.5 m 
and shall also not be combined with principal live loads on the carriageway supported by 
the structural members subjected to such collision loads, as well as wind or seismic load. 
Where pedestrian/cycle track bridge ramps and stairs are structurally independent of the 
main highway-spanning structure, their supports need not be designed for the vehicle 
collision loads. 
Note: The tertiary structures, such as lighting post, signage supports etc. need not be 
designed for vehicle collision loads. 
221:2	
Material factor of safety and Permissible overstressing in foundation
For material factor of safety under collision load reference shall be made to the provision 
in IRC: 112 for concrete and IRC: 24 for steel. For permissible overstressing in foundation, 
refer provision of IRC: 78.
221:3	
Collision Load 
221.3.1	 The nominal loads given in Table 22 shall be considered to act horizontally as 
Vehicle Collision Loads. Supports shall be capable of resisting the main and residual 
load components acting simultaneously. Loads normal to the carriageway below and 
loads parallel to the carriageway below shall be considered to act separately and shall 
not be combined.

may be reduced in proportion to the square of the velocity but not less than 50 percent.
221.3.3	 The bridge supports shall be designed for the residual load component only, if 
protected with suitably designed fencing system taking into account its flexibility, having 
a minimum height of 1.5 m above the carriageway level.

NOTES FOR LOAD CLASSIFICATION CHART 
1)	
The possible variations in the wheel spacings and tyre sizes, for the heaviest single 
axles-cols. (f) and (h), the heaviest bogie axles-col. (j) and also for the heaviest 
axles of the train vehicle of cols. (e) and (g) are given in cols. (k), (I), (m) and (n). 
The same pattern of wheel arrangement may be assumed for all axles of the wheel 
train shown in cols. (e) and (g) as for the heaviest axles. The overall width of tyre in 
mm may be taken as equal to [150+(p-1) 57], where “p” represents the load on tyre 
in tonnes, wherever the tyre sizes are not specified on the chart. 
2)	
Contact areas of tyres on the deck may be obtained from the corresponding tyre 
loads, max. tyre pressures (p) and width of tyre treads.
3)	
The first dimension of tyre size refers to the overall width of tyre and second 
dimension to the rim diameter of the tyre. Tyre tread width may be taken as overall 
tyre width minus 25 mm for tyres upto 225 mm width, and minus 50 mm for tyres 
over 225 mm width.
4)	
The spacing between successive vehicles shall not be less than 30 m. This spacing 
will be measured from the rear-most point of ground contact of the leading vehicles 
to the forward-most point of ground contact of the following vehicle in case of tracked 
vehicles. For wheeled vehicles, it will be measured from the centre of the rear-most 
axle of the leading vehicle to the centre of the first axle of the following vehicle. 
5)	
The classification of the bridge shall be determined by the safe load carrying 
capacity of the weakest of all the structural members including the main girders, 
stringers (or load bearers), the decking, cross bearers (or transome) bearings, piers 
and abutments, investigated under the track, wheel axle and bogie loads shown 
for the various classes. Any bridge upto and including class 40 will be marked 
with a single class number-the highest tracked or wheel standard load class which 
the bridge can safely withstand. Any bridge over class 40 will be marked with a 
single class number if the wheeled and tracked classes are the same, and with dual 
classification sign showing both T and W load classes if the T and W classes are 
different.

6)	
The calculations determining the safe load carrying capacity shall also allow for the 
effects due to impact, wind pressure, longitudinal forces, etc., as described in the 
relevant Clauses of this Code. 
7)	
The distribution of load between the main girders of a bridge is not necessarily 
equal and shall be assessed from considerations of the spacing of the main girders, 
their torsional stiffness, flexibility of the cross bearers, the width of roadway and the 
width of the vehicles, etc., by any rational method of calculations. 
8)	
The maximum single axle loads shown in columns (f) and (h) and the bogie axle 
loads shown in column (j) correspond to the heaviest axles of the trains, shown in 
columns (e) and (g) in load-classes upto and including class 30-R. In the case of 
higher load classes, the single axle loads and bogie axle loads shall be assumed to 
belong to some other hypothetical vehicles and their effects worked out separately 
on the components of bridge deck.
9)	
The minimum clearance between the road face of the kerb and the outer edge of 
wheel or track for any of the hypothetical vehicles shall be the same as for Class AA 
vehicles, when there is only one-lane of traffic moving on a bridge. If a bridge is to 
be designed for two-lanes of traffic for any type of vehicles given in the Chart, the 
clearance may be decided in each case depending upon the circumstances.

2.	
Combination of Loads for the Verification of Equilibrium and Structural 
Strength under Ultimate State
Loads are required to be combined to check the equilibrium and the structural strength 
under ultimate limit state. The equilibrium of the structure shall be checked against 
overturning, sliding and uplift. It shall be ensured that the disturbing loads (overturning, 
sliding and uplifting) shall always be less than the stabilizing or restoring actions. The 
structural strength under ultimate limit state shall be estimated in order to avoid internal 
failure or excessive deformation. The equilibrium and the structural strength shall be 
checked under basic, accidental and seismic combinations of loads. 
3.	
Combination Principles
The following principles shall be followed while using these tables for arriving at the 
combinations: 
	
i)	
All loads shown under Column 1 of Table B.1 or Table B.2 or Table B.3 or 
Table B.4 shall be combined to carry out the relevant verification.
	
ii)	 While working out the combinations, only one variable load shall be considered 
as the leading load at a time. All other variable loads shall be considered as 
accompanying loads. In case if the variable loads produce favourable effect 
(relieving effect) the same shall be ignored.
	
iii)	 For accidental combination, the traffic load on the upper deck of a bridge (when 
collision with the pier due to traffic under the bridge occurs) shall be treated 
as the leading load. In all other accidental situations the traffic load shall be 
treated as the accompanying load.
	
iv)	 During construction the relevant design situation shall be taken into account.
4.	
Basic Combination
4.1	 For Checking the Equilibrium
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the partial safety factor for loads shown in 
Column No. 2 or 3 under Table B.1 shall be adopted.
4.2	 For Checking the Structural Strength
For checking the structural strength, the partial safety factor for loads shown in Column 
No. 2 under Table B.2 shall be adopted.
5.	
Accidental Combination
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the partial safety factor for loads shown 
in Column No. 4 or 5 under Table B.1 and for checking the structural strength, the 



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 122
======================================================================
89
IRC: 6-2017
partial safety factor for loads shown in Column No. 3 under Table B.2 shall be adopted.
6.	
Seismic Combination
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the partial safety factor for loads shown in 
Column No. 6 or 7 under Table B.1 and for checking the structural strength, the partial 
safety factor for loads shown for seismic combination under Column No. 4 under Table 
B.2 and B.4 are applicable only for design basis earthquake (DBE).
7.	
Combination of Loads for the Verification of Serviceability Limit State
Loads are required to be combined to satisfy the serviceability requirements. The 
serviceability limit state check shall be carried out in order to have control on stress, 
deflection, ,Vibration, crack width, settlement and to estimate shrinkage and creep 
effects. It shall be ensured that the design value obtained by using the appropriate 
combination shall be less than the limiting value of serviceability criterion as per the 
relevant code. The rare combination of loads shall be used for checking the stress limit. 
The frequent combination of loads shall be used for checking the deflection, vibration 
and crack width. The quasi-permanent combination of loads shall be used for checking 
the settlement, shrinkage creep effects and the permanent stress in concrete. 
7.1	 Rare Combination 
For checking the stress limits, the partial safety factor for loads shown in Column No. 2 
under Table B.3 shall be adopted. 
7.2	 Frequent Combination
For checking the deflection, vibration and crack width in prestressed concrete structures, 
partial safety factor for loads shown in Column No. 3 under Table B.3 shall be adopted. 
7.3	 Quasi-permanent Combinations
For checking the crack width in RCC structures, settlement, creep effects and to estimate 
the permanent stress in the structure, partial safety factor for loads shown in Column No. 4
under Table B.3 shall be adopted.
8.	
Combination for Design of Foundations
For checking the base pressure under foundation and to estimate the structural strength 
which includes the geotechnical loads, the partial safety factor for loads for 3 combinations 
shown in Table B.4 shall be used. 
The material safety factor for the soil parameters, resistance factor and the allowable 
bearing pressure for these combinations shall be as per relevant code.

Combination for Design of Bearings
	
a)	 The design of the various bearings shall be based on serviceability or ultimate 
limit state depending upon the safety classification of the limit state under 
consideration.
	
b)	 For structures with elastic behavior, all forces and movements should be 
based on characteristic values of action. The method of calculation for actions, 
rotations and deformations shall follow principles set out in IRC:112 (for concrete 
structures), IRC:24 (for Steel Structures) and IRC:22 (for composite structures). 
Where the deformation of the foundation or the piers or the bearings has a 
significant influence on the forces on bearings or the movements of bearings, 
these elements should be included in the analysis model.
	
c)	 The relevant partial factors and combination rules should be applied at 
serviceability, ultimate limit states in conformity with the principles set out in 
Table B.1 to Table B.4 of this code, unless otherwise stated below.
	
d)	 For determining the design values of actions on bearings and their rotations 
and movements, the relevant loading combination for the Basic, Accidental and 
Seismic load combinations should be taken into account under ULS.
	
e)	 Design displacements and rotations due to ‘creep’ and ‘shrinkage’ in concrete 
shall be considered by multiplying mean values of deformation by a factor of 
1.35 under ULS

Annex C
(Clause 209.3.3)
Wind Load Computation on Truss bridge Superstructure 
C-1.1	
Superstructures without live load: The design transverse wind load FT shall 
be derived separately for the areas of the windward and leeward truss girder and deck 
elements. Except that FT need not be derived considering the projected areas of windward 
parapet shielded by windward truss, or vice versa, deck shielded by the windward truss, 
or vice versa and leeward truss shielded by the deck. 
The area A1 for each truss, parapet etc. shall be the solid area in normal projected 
elevation, The area A1 for the deck shall be based on the full depth of the deck. 
C-1.2	
Superstructures with live load: The design transverse wind load shall be 
derived separately for elements as specified in C-1 and also for the live load depth. The 
area Al for the deck, parapets, trusses etc. shall be as for the superstructure without live 
load. The area A1 for the live load shall be derived using the appropriate live load depth. 
C-1.3	
Drag Coefficient CD for all Truss Girder Superstructures 
a)	
Superstructures without live Load :
The drag coefficient CD for each truss and for the deck shall be derived as follows:
 
• 
For a windward truss CD shall be taken from Table C-1.
 
• 
For leeward truss of a superstructure with two trusses, drag coefficient shall be 
taken as ηCD, values of shielding factor η are given in Table C-2. The solidity 
ratio of the truss is the ratio of the effective area to the overall area of the truss. 
 
• 
Where a superstructure has more than two trusses, the drag coefficient for the 
truss adjacent to the windward truss shall be derived as specified above. The 
coefficient for all other trusses shall be taken as equal to this value.
 
• 
For Deck Construction, the drag coefficient shall be taken as 1.1. 
b)	
Superstructure with live load: 
The drag coefficient CD for each truss and for the deck shall be as for the superstructure 
without live load. CD for the unshielded parts of the live load shall be taken as 1.45.
