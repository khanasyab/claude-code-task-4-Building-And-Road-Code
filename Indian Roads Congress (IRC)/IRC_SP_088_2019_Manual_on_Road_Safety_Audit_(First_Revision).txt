Manual on Road Safety Audit
PREAMBLE
The Manual on Road Safety Audit was first published by the IRC as a Special Publication 
IRC: SP:88 as “Manual on Road Safety Audit” in the year 2010. It was based on the research study 
sponsored by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to CSIR - Central Road Research 
Institute (CRRI), New Delhi. However, a need was felt to update and upgrade the contents to 
address all aspects of road safety audit covering all categories of roads and highways located in 
both urban and rural areas of the country in line with international best practices.
Accordingly, the work of revision of the Manual was taken up by the Road Safety and 
Design Committee (H-7) of the Indian Roads Congress. A Sub-group was constituted 
which comprised of Shri Jacob George (Convener) by including other experts namely, 
Dr. S. Velmurugan, Shri D.P. Gupta, Dr. Geetam Tiwari, Shri S.K. Popli, Shri Parampreet Singh 
and Prof. P.K. Agarwal as Sub-Group members. This Sub-group prepared the revised draft 
by duly taking into consideration the version prepared by the World Bank and forwarded to 
the IRC sometime back. The above sub-group after series of deliberations prepared the draft 
revision of IRC:SP:88. Thereafter, H-7 Committee deliberated in detail at its meeting held on 
31st August, 2018. Based on comments made by the members of the Committee, the sub-group 
modified the draft further and the same was considered by the Committee at its meeting held on 
10th October, 2018. The Convener of H-7 Committee, Shri Nirmaljit Singh was authorized to 
forward the modified draft to IRC after modifying further in light of the deliberations for placing 
before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS). The support received 
from the World Bank is gratefully acknowledged. The composition of the H-7 Committee is given

1. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MANUAL
1.1	
A Brief History of Road Safety Audit
1.1.1  	
Road safety audit began in the late 1980s when a Road Safety Engineering (RSE) 
team in a County in England began to question the number of newly built roads that were 
appearing in the County’s black spot list. With support from the County Surveyor, a policy was 
developed requiring all new road designs in the County to be checked and approved for Safety 
by the RSE team prior to construction. This checking process became formalized as Road Safety 
Audit (RSA) and the RSE team became the first road safety audit team. It can be said that RSA 
team applied their black spot investigation skills in a proactive way so as to eliminate safety 
concerns at the design stage. The term “road safety audit” came to be used then, and continues 
to be used today, to refer to a thorough and detailed examination of a road design from a road 
safety perspective.
1.1.2	
Similar procedures and policies spread throughout other British road agencies and the 
first “road safety audit manual” was published by the Institution of Highways and Transportation 
(IHT) in late 1990 to guide and encourage this new process. The road safety audit process has 
expanded globally since then, beginning initially in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and 
Denmark, before spreading through Malaysia, South Africa, and Singapore including India. In 
1992, AUSTROADS developed a set of guidelines for use within Australia and New Zealand. In 
other parts of the world, road agencies were actively working towards the implementation of road 
safety audit in their jurisdiction. In subsequent years, many more road agencies in Asia, Europe, 
North America and parts of the Middle East adopted the Road Safety Audit (RSA) process in 
ways that best suited their local needs.
1.2	
Purpose of Road Safety Audit
This Manual is aimed at the road authorities (decision makers), engineers, technicians, consultants, 
contractors, concessionaires concerned with road projects, irrespective of category of road or 
the area where they work. The application of safety principles in the provision, improvement and 
maintenance of roads as means of accident prevention can be established through road safety 
audit. Thus, the purpose of this audit is to ensure that road users would be exposed to minimal 
risks of accidents in both new roads and existing roads.
1.3	
How to use this Manual
1.3.1	
This manual has been prepared as an-easy-to-read guide for the road safety audit of 
new road designs and existing roads. It contains details about engaging an audit team and the 
road safety audit process that will assist the members of audit teams to undertake an audit. This 
manual is a valuable instructional tool for auditors and for project managers alike.
1.3.2 	
To assist with the learning task, this manual includes audit case studies from typical 
road projects. The case study reports are reduced in length for practical reasons but the important 
safety findings from each have been placed into a table of findings. The table is simple, easy 
to read and to understand. It gives a blank column for the Client to use to respond to each 
recommendation from the audit team.

1.3.3 	
To further assist audit teams, a full set of audit checklists is included in this manual. 
There is one checklist for each stage of audit; these checklists prompt audit teams to consider the 
multitude of safety issues that can arise in road projects including the safety needs of vulnerable 
road users.
1.3.4 	
To be a good auditor, one should have thorough knowledge and experience in road 
safety engineering, besides technical qualifications. However, this manual does not present all 
the technical road safety engineering information that an auditor needs to keep in mind for the 
audit task. Auditors are advised to refer to the various relevant IRC Codes, Manuals, Guidelines 
and other international best practices.

2. ROAD SAFETY AUDIT: AN OVERVIEW
This section explains the how, what, when, where and why of road safety audits. It provides useful 
information for everyone with a responsibility for planning, designing, managing, constructing, 
operating or maintaining roads and highways.
2.1	
The Road Safety Situation
In India, out of the 4,64,650 road crashes, 1,47,913 fatalities and 4,70,975 injuries had resulted 
in the year 2017. In economic terms, the cost to the nation is an estimated 3 % of Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). A majority of fatalities are in the age group of 18 to 45 years. There is need for 
coordinated action by all the key stakeholders to address this serious concern. Road Safety 
Audit on roads is one critical step in that direction.
2.2	
How can Engineers Reduce Road Trauma?
2.2.1	
The road safety problem involves three components - the human, the vehicle and the 
road. International research shows that the road plays a crucial role in road crashes.
It is often stated in public discussions that more should be done to improve the behaviour of 
road users. There are also frequent calls for increased enforcement of the road rules. Both calls 
reflect the involvement of the human factor in road crashes.
2.2.2	
The roads are also in need of safety improvements and across the country, there are 
instances of geometric deficiencies, inconsistent pavement markings, missing (or wrong) road 
signs, traffic signals not operational, inadequate attention to needs of the vulnerable road users. 
The community expects their roads to provide clear efficient traffic management and high levels 
of safety, as well as to withstand the weather conditions. Pedestrians and cyclists are often left to 
cross high speed roads without assistance, especially in case of highway passing through urban 
settlements and villages. If crashes occur due to design deficiencies, the community will pay a 
much higher price than the initial capital cost. The cost of serious and fatal crashes can end up 
costing much more over the life of a road project than the initial capital cost.
2.2.3	
The engineers are not expected to “wash their hands” of the safety problems on the 
roads and highways. Engineers are an important part of the solution to the road safety problem. 
Examining how road projects cleared through the traditional system of engineering design and 
hence checking yields a clear answer to the question of why the road safety audit process is 
needed in all road authorities:
●	
Sometimes a new design may include standards inappropriate for the type of road. 
●	
In some cases, outdated standards may be used in a design.
●	
Sometimes, the combination of various elements of the design may yield a result that 
is not the best in terms of safety.
●	
Compromises may be made between traffic carrying capacity and safety which lead 
to a lessening of safety in the finished road project.
●	
Sometimes changes are made during construction which does not fully consider 
operational safety factors.

IRC:SP:88-2019

2.2.4	
Road safety audit seeks to take an overall view of safety in a road project. It highlights 
safety issues and makes recommendations to minimize the effect of each. Road safety audit will 
not necessarily make every new design totally “safe” but it does raise safety high on the decision 
making agenda and it does cause deliberate decisions to be made on the basis of carefully 
brought out road safety recommendations. The earlier in the design process that an audit is 
carried out, the easier and less costly it is to achieve change. Early auditing at planning and 
design stages can achieve better safety results and usually at a much lower remedial cost.
2.2.5	
Road authorities may bear in mind that road safety audit is a more effective process 
if carried out early in the road design process. It is urged, therefore, to focus on design stage 
audits.
2.2.6	
In the early years of auditing, some road authorities in some countries tried to “catch-
up” with the problems on their existing networks by auditing important roads and highways as a 
matter of priority. They perceived the audit of an existing road to be the “easiest” stage of audit, 
the one stage that can be undertaken by existing staff who can use that experience to prepare for 
later design stage audits. Unfortunately, this practice has left a legacy of numerous audit reports 
recommending safety improvements that cannot be treated because of funding constraints.
2.2.7	
This, in turn, has led to disillusionment about the entire road safety audit process. The 
staffs responsible for organizing those audits have questioned why they were carried out. The 
audits have not produced any real safety benefits for the road users - so why bother?
2.2.8	
Another negative aspect caused by this primary focus on existing road audits has 
been the mistaken view amongst some engineers that road safety audits and hazardous road 
location (blackspot) investigations are identical. This is not so. 
2.2.9	
Road safety audits are proactive - they try to identify safety issues in a road design. 
The objective here is accident/crash prevention.
2.2.10	
Road crash investigations are reactive - they examine known crash sites and use 
crash data to develop cost-effective countermeasures. The objective here is accident/crash 
reduction.
2.2.11	
The same road safety engineering skills and experience are needed for each process, 
but it is important to recognize that they are different processes and they produce different 
deliverables.
2.2.12	
Programmes to reduce road crashes on existing roads through systematic crash 
investigation programmes (commonly called blackspot programmes) are also vital in any road 
agency. Such programs have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing the frequency and/or 
severity of crashes at high crash frequency locations.
2.2.13	
A safety-conscious road agency will therefore include both the blackspot investigation 
programme and the road safety audit process within its engineering department. Both of these 
are important and both produce positive road safety benefits to the community. To sum up, RSA 
is proactive, road crash investigation is reactive.
2.2.14	
Noting these words of caution, road authorities may find that safety audit of existing 
roads can still hold positive benefits, especially as they rarely have complete crash data to guide

their accident investigation work. By auditing a stretch of existing road, an experienced road 
safety audit team can identify locations of heightened risk and can recommend cost effective 
improvements to reduce that risk.
2.2.15 	
If any road authority elects to develop such a program, there is need to:
●	
Clearly define the stretch of the road to be audited and the types of risks/crashes 
that need attention (e.g. collisions with roadside hazards, or head-on collisions, or 
pedestrian crashes, or intersection crashes).
●	
Have an agreed budget available for the remedial work. Unlike many safety issues 
identified in design stage audits, which may cost little to change, improving safety 
issues on an existing road may involve significant cost!
●	
Ask the audit team to prioritize their findings (from highest to lowest) to provide 
guidance on where to spend programme budget. It is possible that the cost of the 
recommended remedial work may exceed the budget.
2.3	
Prevention is Better than Cure
Road safety audit is summarized with the statement “prevention is better than cure”. Road safety 
audit is a process of crash prevention – it aims to identify safety concerns in a road design in 
order for changes to be made while they “are still pencil lines on a piece of paper”. By making 
changes at the design stage, road safety can be built in to new road projects and the risk to the 
future users of that road can be minimized. 
2.4	
What is Road Safety Audit?
2.4.1	
A road safety audit is “a formal, systematic and detailed examination of a road project 
by an independent and qualified team of auditors that leads to a report of the potential safety 
concerns in the project.” A formal examination of design would not permit a layout shown below 
causing unsafe and illegitimate movement. Such potential unsafe situations would be captured 
in a safety audit and can be modified before implementation. 
2.4.2	
It is a formal examination because 
the audit follows a set process that leads to 
a formal report which then becomes a part 
of the record of the whole road project. It 
is a detailed examination that requires time, 
knowledge, skill, judgment, depth and detail.
2.4.3	
It requires a team of independent 
auditors, each of whom is detached from 
the design team and who are qualified and 
experienced in road safety engineering practices. Other professionals could also add inputs to 
an audit, but the main auditors shall invariably have engineering background. Having a team 
of auditors (rather than a sole auditor) provides a variety of experiences that increases the 
likelihood of a potential safety concern being detected. Two heads are better than one!
2.4.4	
The outcome of a road safety audit is a road safety audit report that identifies road safety

8
issues and makes recommendations to remove or reduce the impact of these. Responsibility to 
implement these recommendations remains with road authority.
2.4.5	
 A road safety audit assesses the safety of all road users including car drivers and 
passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists, trucks, bus passengers and 3-wheelers 
and users of animal drawn vehicles.
2.4.6	
Road safety audit is:
●	
A formal process (not just an informal check).
●	
Conducted by persons who are independent of the design.
●	
Conducted by persons with appropriate qualification, training and experience.
●	
An assessment of road safety issues in a road design, a Traffic Management Plan for 
road works, a newly completed road scheme, or it can be the identification of safety 
concerns on any existing road.
2.4.7	
Just as Importantly, a Road Safety Audit is not:
●	
a check of compliance with standards.
●	
a substitute for regular design checks.
●	
a crash investigation.
●	
an opportunity to re-design a project which needs to be carried out separately.
●	
a name for a more detailed site inspection.
●	
a way of assessing or rating a project as good or bad.
2.4.8	
A good road safety audit will be accomplished when:
●	
Focus is on road safety issues only.
●	
Keep relevant standards and guidelines in mind while remembering that audit is more 
than compliance check with standards.
●	
Consider the needs of all road users (including pedestrians, two/three wheelers, 
animal drawn vehicles, depending upon their presence and proportion in the traffic) in 
all weather and lighting conditions. 
●	
It is thorough and comprehensive.
●	
It is realistic and practical in findings. But do not rule out options because of cost - it 
is the road authority that will decide whether the investment can be justified.
●	
Produce audit report promptly - usually within four weeks of the audit inspection.
2.4.9	
Designers are expected to comply with standards but audit job is not to check that 
they have done this. Auditing job as an auditor is to put himself into the shoes of the future 
road users of the road – how will they use the new road and what safety problems may some

of them encounter? Undertaking a road safety audit can be described as a combination of art 
and science – the art of appreciating the needs of the future users of the road coupled with the 
science of sound engineering principles.
2.5	
Objectives of Road Safety Audit
2.5.1	
The main objective of road safety audit is to minimize the risk of crashes occurring on 
an existing road/a new road project and to minimize the severity of any crashes that do occur or 
are likely to occur.
2.5.2	
There are other objectives too, including:
●	
To minimize the risk of crashes occurring on adjacent roads (especially at intersections).
●	
To recognize the importance of safety in road design so that the needs and perceptions 
of all road users are met, and to achieve a balance between needs where they may 
be in conflict.
●	
To reduce the long term costs of a new road project, bearing in mind that unsafe 
designs may be expensive (or at times even impossible) to correct at a later stage.
●	
To enhance the awareness of road safety engineering principles by all involved in the 
process of planning, designing, constructing, operating, managing and maintaining 
roads and highways.
●	
To advance the awareness of providing safe road schemes for non-motorized as well 
as motorized road users.
2.6	
A Brief Outline of the Key Steps in a Road Safety Audit
Step by step through a Road Safety Audit
1
Complying with the road safety audit policy of an organization, make a decision that 
the project is to be audited.
2
Appoint a safety audit team.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
10
3
Handover (either in person/electronically or in a commencement meeting) all relevant 
information (the drawings and design reports) about the project to the Team Leader of 
RSA team.
4
It is necessary to hold a commencement meeting between the three key parties - 
Project Manager of the road authority, designers and the audit team to discuss the 
project and scope of audit.
5
Afterwards, the audit team begins the audit. The first part of its work is a “desktop” 
audit of the drawings and design reports.
6
The audit team then moves to the next part of the audit - a detailed inspection of the 
site during day time and night time. The team gathers by shooting chainage-wise 
photographs of all the problematic locations and records its observations. In case 
chainage-wise information is not available (for example on urban roads); the identified 
safety concern can be linked with the adjacent landmark on the candidate road stretch. 
Also, if any good road safety measure is found to be practiced by the road authority 
during the audit, the same shall be noted and recorded as part of RSA. Further, the 
audit team is advised to recommend for replication of safe practices at similar such 
problematic locations in their RSA report. This will in turn help in boosting the morale 
and confidence of the concerned road authority towards proper upkeep of the road.
7
Back in the office, the audit team prepares the audit report. When it is written, checked 
and signed it is submitted to the Project Manager (either in person or electronically).
8
For large or sensitive projects, there may be a completion meeting in order for the 
stakeholders to discuss and clarify the key safety issues
9
A paper trail is a required outcome from an audit and the Project Manager/Road 
Authority is required to add to this by responding to each audit recommendation – 
clearly stating what actions will or will not take place. Reasons for not accepting any 
recommendation shall be recorded.
10
Thereafter, implement all agreed changes and recommendations.
2.7	
Why is Road Safety Audit Necessary?
2.7.1	
Planning, designing, constructing, operating, managing and maintaining roads and 
highways is a complex task. The engineers charged with this responsibility usually face a wide 
variety of competing constraints and issues as they progress with their work.
2.7.2	
Typical constraints include:
●	
Land acquisition
●	
Project cost
●	
Standards and guidelines
●	
Traffic carrying capacity
●	
Environmental impacts

●	
Resettlement and other socio-economic impacts
●	
Geotechnical conditions
●	
Archaeological sites
●	
Safety of road workers and maintenance crews
2.7.3	
The design team and the Project Manager of the road authority work to achieve an 
optimal solution. But sometimes, compromises are made which can lead to an increase in crash 
risk. The road safety audit process is now available to input road safety engineering expertise 
into the design process. The road safety audit team is the group of specialists that injects safety 
into the road design and assists the road authority to create a road that is as safe as reasonably 
practical.
2.8	
The Five Stages of Auditing a Road Project
2.8.1	
There are five stages of a road project at which a road safety audit can be conducted.
Stage 1	
Feasibility Stage/Preliminary Design Stage
2.8.2	
An audit on completion of the planning or feasibility study stage will examine features 
such as design standards, route choice and continuity with the existing adjacent network, 
horizontal and vertical alignments, cross sections and interchange/intersection layouts. Careful 
auditing at this early feasibility study stage can help to reduce the costs and lost time associated 
with changes that may otherwise be brought about during later audits.
Stage 2	
Detailed Design Stage
2.8.3	
This audit stage occurs on completion of the detailed road design (the final DPR) but 
before the preparation of contract documents. Typical considerations include geometric layout, 
pavement markings, signals, lighting, road signs, intersection details, clearances to roadside 
objects (crash barriers/frangibility) and provision for vulnerable road users. Attention to detail at 
this design stage can do much to reduce the costs and disturbance associated with last minute 
changes that may otherwise be brought about with a pre-opening audit.
Stage 3	
Construction Stage
2.8.4	
This stage of audit takes place during construction of the road works. It examines the 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
12
safety of the traffic management plans for each phase of construction for large road projects (i.e. 
before the works begin), and it also inspects the provisions for road safety at the road work site 
during the construction period. Typical issues examined include the provisions for pedestrian 
safety, advanced warning zones, adequate transition zone lengths, worker safety, effective 
numbers of reflective signs, safe delineation, credible speed limits, temporary crash barriers, 
lighting and diversions.
Stage 4	
Pre-Opening Stage
2.8.5	
This audit involves a detailed inspection of the new road project immediately prior 
to its opening. Although most road projects are constructed “under traffic” there is a time just 
before the Contractor hands over the project when the project is almost complete and when a 
pre-opening stage audit is undertaken. The new road should be driven, ridden and walked (as 
appropriate) by the audit team to ensure that the safety needs of all road users are provided for. 
A night-time inspection is particularly important at this stage to check installation and visibility of 
signs, markings, delineation, lighting and any other night time/low light related issues.
2.8.6	
The number of project stages at which audits are conducted usually varies according 
to the classification of the road, and the size of the project. For example, a major road project on 
an expressway or multilane highway may be audited at each of the project stages. For efficient 
use of limited resources, smaller projects on roads carrying low volume of traffic may be audited 
at one or two stages.
Stage 5	
Safety Audit of Existing Roads
2.8.7	
The existing road may be a well-established road dating back decades or it may be a 
recently upgraded or rehabilitated road. The audit of existing road aims to ensure that the safety 
features of a road are compatible with the functional classification of the road. It also aims to 
identify any feature that may develop over time into a safety issue (such as a tree blocking sight 
lines at an intersection).
2.8.8	
A number of the safety issues found in these audits should be readily addressed 
through simple and low cost maintenance practices (e.g. tree trimming, sign and line marking 
renewal, and roadside hazard issues). As such, there are benefits in having maintenance crews 
trained in road safety reviews so that they can apply their safety knowledge routinely during each 
shift.
2.8.9	
These crews may not be independent of the existing road network, and they may not 
be able to look at the road through the eyes of a first time user, but they will be able to eliminate 
the more obvious safety concerns.
2.8.10	
Another issue with safety audits of existing roads revolves around the use of crash 
data. Some auditors like to have access to the Police crash data for the road they are auditing. 
They say it helps them to understand some of the proven safety issues along the road.
2.8.11	
Others argue that this can cause the audit team to focus too closely on the crash sites, 
possibly overlooking other high risk locations. Whichever option is adopted, the road authority 
should be very clear in its objectives. If it wants a crash investigation, use crash data together 
with the audit.



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
13
2.8.12.	
The audit team should prioritize its findings according to those that can most readily and 
cost-effectively be treated. It makes easier for the road authority to undertake the recommended 
treatments as per available budget.
2.9	
What Projects are to be Road Safety Audited?
2.9.1	
All new road projects will benefit from having road safety audits undertaken during the 
design and construction stages. However, in recognition of the need to apply resources to where 
they can have maximum effect, road safety audits may be commissioned only at selected stages 
according to the cost of the road project or the classification of the road.
2.9.2	
It is difficult to be too definitive about the types of road project most in need of an audit 
but, as a general rule, audit:
●	
any road project on a high speed road.
●	
any road project experiencing high volume of traffic and vulnerable road users.
2.9.3	
Another question is about the number of stages of audit to undertake. In general, the 
larger the road project, the more stages of audit it should have. But remember that it is not the 
cost of the project that is important; it is the cost of the mistake!
2.9.4	
Safety issues can occur even in minor road projects and if they go unresolved, deaths 
and injuries may result. Complying with the road safety audit policy (See Section 4.3 for a draft 
policy) of an organization is an important step forward.
2.9.5	
Safety audit in respect of Rural Roads (Other District Roads and Village Roads) and 
Roads in Urban Areas may require some special considerations during the audit process. These 
are discussed briefly in Sections 2.12 and 2.13.
2.10	
Key Groups involved in a Road Safety Audit - their Roles and Responsibilities
2.10.1	
There are three key groups involved in the road safety audit process:
The Client
2.10.2	
The organization (road authority) that is responsible for the project and which is 
deemed to be the “owner” of the road on behalf of the government. The Project Manager is the 
day-to-day representative of the Client on technical matters. While the Client is usually a road 
authority, it can also be a private investor (concessionaire) for toll roads. However, even in such 
cases, the road authority being the final Client, will ultimately decide what is to be done (and not 
to be done) in the road project.
Designers
2.10.3	
A person but usually a team commissioned by the Project Manager for the Client or 
by the Concessionaire to design and develop the road project. The design team may be a part 
of the Client organization or may come from a separate consulting company. The designers 
provide a service to the Client by designing the new road within the stated constraints issued by 
the Client.



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
14
Audit team
2.10.4	
A team of normally 2 persons who are qualified as road safety auditors and who 
are independent of the design and the proposal. The audit team is engaged by the Project 
Manager for the Client. While the audit team may come from the Client’s organization (provided 
the team members are clearly independent of the project) they are now increasingly from 
specialist consultancy companies. The audit team provides a service to the Client by finding 
safety problems in the design.
2.10.5	
When preparing Terms of Reference for an audit, or engaging an audit team to 
undertake an audit, it is necessary to be clear about the interaction of these three key groups. 
There must be shared co-operation and a clear understanding that all groups are ultimately 
working to one goal. However, the audit team is charged with injecting road safety expertise 
into the project and there may be occasions when the other groups question what the auditors 
recommend.
2.10.6	
On such occasions, the audit team should maintain its position and push for the most 
appropriate safety outcome regardless of where the opposition may come from. The audit team 
does not have to concern itself with other factors (such as funding, environmental issues, traffic 
carrying capacity). It is to be borne in mind that road safety audit team is the champion of the 
cause of road safety. The team members should be clear and firm in promoting the cause of 
safety.
2.10.7	
At the same time, the audit team should recognize that the Client has the responsibility 
to weigh up all competing factors and to decide the way forward. The team should put forward its 
case for safety as clearly as possible but then leave the Client, Project Manager and the design 
team to decide what will be done. The audit team may be invited to provide additional safety 
advice during the Completion meeting or afterwards but the team must recognize the right of the 
Client to ultimately decide.
2.10.8	
The main functions of the key players in the road safety audit are summarized in 
Table 2.1.

2.11 
The Benefits of Audits
2.11.1	
The established benefits of conducting road safety audits include:
●	
Reduced “whole of life cycle costs” of a road project.
●	
Reduced risk of crash and its severity while using the road network.
●	
Enhanced attention to the safety needs of vulnerable road users.
●	
Lower costs for remedial work at (future) black spots.
●	
Reduced overall costs of road trauma to the community.
●	
Safer road networks are developed.
●	
They are an important contributor to meeting crash reduction targets.
2.11.2 	
In the process, the highway profession also benefits from:
●	
Development of increased understanding and documentation of road safety 
engineering.
●	
Enhanced level of importance for road safety engineering.
●	
Serve to review and update safety standards and procedures.
2.12	
Rural Roads
2.12.1 	
Rural roads are generally single lane with low design speeds and low volumes of 
traffic (both motorized and non-motorized). In some states, these roads have intermediate lane 
(5.5 m) or two-lane (7.0 m) wide carriageway. With development of rural roads, these roads 
are experiencing accelerated growth of traffic. One negative externality associated with this is 
increased potential for accidents. 
2.12.2	
As with other categories of roads, crashes on rural roads may be caused by one or a 
combination of several factors such as:
(i)	
Road design: compromise on geometric design due to land constraints, lack of proper 
road signs, pavement markings and other traffic control devices, poor intersection 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
16
layout, inadequate sight distance, unmanned railway level crossings.
(ii)	
Road condition: Uneven and slippery road surface, pot holes, sunken shoulders and 
edge break, rut formation.
(iii)	
Bridge condition: Gap in expansion joints, worn out bearings, broken parapets.
(iv)	
Road users: Dangerous driving (excessive speed, excessive alcohol), fatigue, not 
wearing seat belt/helmets. Sections passing through habitations and schools pose 
safety risk to pedestrians, cyclists and even cattle and non-motorized vehicles.
(v)	
Vehicles: Failure of brakes and steering systems, tyre burst, lighting system, night 
time conspicuity.
(vi)	
Environment factors: Heavy rainfall, fog, snow, storm, etc. creating unsafe driving 
environment.
2.12.3	
Checklist
	
The checklist in Section 7.3 will be applicable for safety audit of rural roads also.
2.12.4 	
Safety Aspects in Rural Roads
	
The road agencies responsible for rural roads need to ensure that safety engineering 
measures are embedded into the design during preparation of DPRs and estimates. 
2.12.5 	
The following aspects for improving safety on these roads may be given due attention:
(a) 	
Road signs and pavement markings should be integral part of road construction 
and upgradation works. The signs should be retro-reflective and markings done with 
thermoplastic reflective paints. They will also require regular maintenance to serve the 
intended purpose. There should be no compromise whatsoever on this requirement 
in all rural road projects and programmes.
(b) 	
Where the existing geometrics of the road alignment are poor, efforts should be 
made to undertake spot improvements identifying such locations. In the meanwhile, 
appropriate cautionary and speed limit signs should be posted at such locations. 
Where there is history of or potential for accidents, proper traffic calming measures 
should be provided with proper advance warning signs.
(c) 	
Intersections and junctions of rural roads with main roads need special emphasis. 
The layout design may be finalized in consultation with traffic specialists. Provision 
of traffic calming measures on rural roads just ahead of their meeting point with the 
main highway would be of help. There is also need to ensure availability of safe sight 
distance.
(d) 	
Provision of bus bays at suitable location close to villages en-route and ramps for 
providing access to agricultural fields may also be considered. At the end of the road, 
adequate space needs to be ensured so as to enable turning of buses and other 
commercial vehicles.
(e)	
Provision of proper crash barriers, hazard markers and parapets on bridges and 
embankments on curves, especially in hill areas with valleys and gorges posing safety 
hazards.

IRC:SP:88-2019
17
(f)	
Replacing unmanned railway crossings with underpasses/road over bridges or with 
gates to ensure their closing at the time of train passing through such locations.
2.13	
Urban Roads
2.13.1	
Urban road is the one with a relatively high density of driveway access located in 
an urban area and having traffic signals with a minimum spacing of one kilometer. The term 
‘Urban Road Segment’ refers to the length of road with control arrangements at both of its 
ends, i.e. the upstream and downstream intersections are controlled intersections. Conducting 
of Road Safety Audit (RSA) of urban roads wherein the interaction of Motorized Traffic (MT) 
would invariably occur with the Non-Motorized Traffic (NMT). Motorized Traffic primarily consists 
of buses, cars, two/three wheelers including electric rickshaws with different dimensions and 
horse power and a minor proportion of goods vehicles (tempos, trucks) share the available road 
space with NMT traffic which includes cyclists, cycle rickshaws as well as pedestrians [identified 
as (Vulnerable Road Users)] would have frequent interaction with mixed mode motorized traffic 
typically witnessed on roads. Therefore, the RSA should ideally aim at providing safer environs 
considering such issues.  Recognizing the emphasis of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs 
(MOHUA) as well as Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to provide increased mobility on urban roads 
during the last two decades, these roads are experiencing accelerated growth of traffic. One 
negative externality associated with the above phenomenon is the increasing trend of number of 
road crashes, especially during the lean hours of traffic on urban centers / cities. It is seen that 
on the urban roads of the country, chainage details are invariably absent. In the absence of the 
same, it is recommended to refer the adjacent prominent locations on the road judiciously while 
preparing the RSA report. This would help the road owning authority to implement the suggested 
changes in a logical manner. 
2.13.2	
As witnessed on other categories of roads, the root causes for the incidences of road 
crashes on urban roads can be attributed to one or a combination of several factors such as:
●	
Road design: compromise on geometric design due to land or Right of Way (RoW) 
constraints, lack of proper road signs, pavement markings, poor intersection layout, 
poorly designed and ineffectively placed signalized junction, inadequate sight distance 
and absence of segregation of NMT from Motorized traffic. 
●	
Road condition: Uneven and slippery road surface and pot holes.
●	
Geometry: Poor geometrics coupled with absence of associated road appurtenances 
at the diverging and merging locations of flyovers. 
●	
Road users: Dangerous driving (excessive speed, excessive alcohol), fatigue, not 
wearing seat belt/helmets.
●	
Vehicles: Failure of brakes and steering systems, tyre burst, lighting system, night 
time conspicuity.
●	
Environment factors: Heavy rainfall, fog, snow, storm, etc. creating unsafe driving 
environment due to poor drainage system, inadequate lighting.
2.13.3	
Checklist
	
The checklist in Section 7.5 will be applicable for the conduct of safety audit on urban 
roads as well.

Safety Aspects of Urban Roads 
	
The road agencies responsible for urban roads need to ensure that safety engineering 
measures given in Section 7.3 are embedded into the design during preparation of Detailed 
Project Reports and estimates. 
2.13.5	
The following aspects for improving safety on urban roads may be given due attention:
(a) 	
Road signs and pavement markings should be integral part of road construction 
and upgradation works. The signs should be minimum of micro prismatic grade or 
better in terms of its retro-reflectivity properties and markings shall be done with 
thermoplastic retro reflective paints. They will also require regular maintenance to 
serve the intended purpose. There should be no compromise whatsoever on this 
requirement for all types of urban roads.
(b) 	
Where the existing geometrics of the road alignment are poor, efforts should be made 
to undertake spot improvements identifying such locations. It is essential to mention 
in the audit report that till such improvements are carried out, appropriate cautionary 
and speed limit signs should be posted at such locations. Where there is history of 
or potential for road crashes, proper traffic calming measures coupled with proper 
advance warning signs should be suggested in the RSA report.
(c) 	
Intersections on urban roads need special treatment in terms of providing facilities for 
all types of Vulnerable Road Users. The layout design shall be finalized by the Urban 
Local Bodies (ULBs) in consultation with traffic specialists. Provision of traffic calming 
measures on urban roads catering to large number of pedestrians crossing the major 
roads, the recommendation for the erection of Speed Table conforming to IRC:99 
would be of help.
(d) 	
Provision of bus bays at suitable location at least 75 m away from the intersections. 
(e) 	
Provision of cement concrete crash barriers, hazard markers and parapets on flyovers 
and bridges.

3. CONDUCTING A ROAD SAFETY AUDIT - THE KEY STEPS
3.1	
Road Safety Audit Process
3.1.1	
Road safety audits are undertaken to identify safety concerns in a road design so that 
those who are responsible for delivering the road project can take these safety concerns into 
account and make the necessary amendments at an early time.
3.1.2	
The road safety audit process has ten steps. For some small road projects, some 
of these ten steps may be brief, but the sequence of steps still applies. The 10-step process is 
illustrated in Table 3.1.

Deciding that an Audit is Necessary
3.2.1	
The Project Manager on approval of road authority decides which road projects are to 
be audited. In some road authorities, decision to audit a project is based on the road hierarchy. 
Works on expressways or national highways and primary arterials are always audited and usually 
at several stages. Projects on other roads are likely to be audited at fewer stages.

3.2.2	
A draft road safety audit policy (outlined in Section 4.3) is included in this manual to 
guide road authorities about the type of road projects that should be audited and the stages of 
audit that may be undertaken. This draft policy may help the road authority to establish an audit 
policy that suits the needs of the organization and road users. Any policy should be realistic 
and it will need to take into account the resources (human and financial) available to the road 
authority. It may be better to start small and work up.
3.2.3	
Sometimes, in the absence of an audit policy, other criteria may be used to decide 
about auditing a road project, including:
●	
At what stages in planning, design and construction will the audit be most useful? 
(Generally, the design stage would prove the better!)
●	
Will this road project benefit from an audit? (The answer is almost always yes!)
3.3	
Selecting the Road Safety Audit Team
3.3.1	
The road safety audit process is quite straightforward, but the qualification, experience 
and skills necessary to undertake a successful and worthwhile audit are quite substantial and 
extensive. The audit team needs to be able to interpret technical drawings and design reports, 
looking for any possible negative (unsafe) features included and at the same time any positive 
(safe) features left out.
3.3.2	
The audit team also needs to be able to communicate clearly the safety concerns it 
finds in a report to the Project Manager. Writing a technically competent, clear and yet concise 
audit report is an important requirement. The report should detail the findings of the audit to the 
Project Manager and the design team. If they cannot understand the safety concerns detected 
in the audit, there is a risk they may take decisions which could lead to either a waste of public 
funds or to unsafe outcomes for road users.
3.3.3	
However, the most significant aspect of good auditors is their ability to “put themselves 
into the shoes of the future road users” of motorized and non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. 
Thus, the auditor will be better positioned to interpret the drawings and design reports and to 
draw out the key safety concerns for the future.
Good auditors “put themselves into the shoes of the future road users”
3.3.4	
In order to improve the likelihood of engaging a good audit team, road authorities 
should make clear in the Terms of Reference that a road safety audit is to be performed by a 
team (minimum of two persons) that is experienced and expert in the process.
3.3.5	
Successful road safety auditors will have qualification and experience in road safety 
engineering. This experience will be enhanced if the auditor also has an understanding of:
●	
Traffic engineering
●	
Road design and construction techniques 
●	
Aptitude for crash investigation techniques.
●	
Road user behavior
3.3.6	
There are many benefits of engaging an audit team of two persons to undertake the 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
21
audit rather than using a single auditor. The main benefits include:
●	
Different perspectives of the same issue can be gained. This can arise from the 
diversity of background and from the different experiences of a team.
●	
Cross fertilization of ideas. When two professionals discuss safety issues in the office 
during the “desktop” audit or when on site, they help each other to develop clarity in 
their ideas and a wider view of the potential safety concerns in the project.
●	
More knowledge readily available on-site. If the audit team has members with different 
background, they can assist each other on technical issues. Two heads are better 
than one.
A qualified and skilled audit team – with experience relevant to the size and stage of 
project being audited – is essential
3.3.7	
The Project Manager appoints the audit team and also specifies the number of team 
members in the team. The Project Manager may decide to use the draft Terms of Reference (see 
Section 4.4) to clearly define the requirements for the audit.
3.3.8	
Each audit team should be led by a Senior Road Safety Auditor, having adequate 
qualification and experience in road safety engineering.
3.3.9	
The audit team leader is responsible for managing the audit, communicating with the 
Project Team and ensuring that the report is completed on time. The team leader is usually the 
most experienced member of the audit team and will provide technical guidance and leadership 
to the other team member.
3.3.10	
In appointing the audit team, the authority may consider the following:
●	
Is the auditor independent of the project?
●	
Has the auditor attended an approved audit training programme?
●	
Has the auditor the necessary qualifications, experience and skills for this size and 
stage of project?
●	
Is the auditor able to see potential safety concerns from different road users’ points of 
view?
3.3.11	
The first essential ingredient in any road safety qualification and audit team is 
road safety engineering experience. In addition, it is important to select member with relevant 
experience: is the project an expressway or a local street; is it an urban or a rural road project? 
What stage of audit is involved? One of the most critical elements in any road safety audit is 
the judgment, technical knowledge and skills of the audit team. There is no substitute for an 
experienced road safety audit team that understands the audit process and is able to foresee 
potential safety concerns.
3.3.12	
How many people should be in an audit team? This depends on the size of the audit 
task. However, as a general rule, a team of two members may be considered for most audits. 
For minor projects on low volume roads in low speed locations, the team may comprise of one 
Senior Road Safety Auditor along with one Apprentice Auditor who is qualified civil engineer and 
trained in road safety.



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
22
3.3.13	
Audits can provide an opportunity for less experienced staff to be “assistant and/or 
apprentices” on a team and to learn about the process and the skills involved.
3.4 
Providing all the Background Information
3.4.1	
The project team/design team provides a copy of all the necessary drawings and 
reports to the audit team leader to permit a thorough road safety audit to take place.
3.4.2	
Care is needed to make sure 
that the audit team is given the latest 
version of drawings and design reports 
in order to minimize the chance they 
could be looking at an obsolete drawing. 
3.4.3	
For some audits (usually small 
projects), there may be only a very few 
A-3 sized drawings. For other projects 
(large projects on national highways and 
expressways), there may be hundreds 
of drawings and a number of detailed 
reports for the audit team to examine. It 
does take time and resources to gather 
together all the current drawings and 
documents. The Project Manager and 
the design team should be aware of this and should keep this in view when commissioning an 
audit.
3.4.4	
One of the first tasks for the audit team is to list all of the drawings and reports that 
have been given to it for the audit. This list becomes a part of the audit report.
3.5	
Holding a Commencement Meeting
3.5.1	
Commencement meetings enable the audit team leader to meet with the Project 
Manager and also the design manager.
3.5.2	
Commencement meetings provide an opportunity to explain the audit process to the 
Project Manager and designers, and to reassure them (if needed) that the audit will help their 
project. Sometimes, especially during the early days of audit in a new organization, some Project 
Managers and designers may feel a little threatened by having an audit undertaken on their 
project.
3.5.3	
After gaining experience with audits however, almost all Project Managers welcome 
the safety inputs their project can gain from audits. They start to see audits as the main opportunity 
to inject road safety expertise into their project. This is positive and beneficial to all.
3.5.4	
The Commencement meeting is also a time for the designer to explain where 
compromises may have been made in the design. Often the designers will already have safety 
concerns about parts of their design.
3.5.5	
This meeting also provides an opportunity for the audit team to request any other 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
23
information that it feels is necessary. The audit team will not be able to inspect the site under 
all traffic or weather conditions, so if particular conditions are important (e.g. traffic conditions 
during market days), the audit team should be advised.
3.5.6	
As audits become more common, commencement meetings will become less 
significant. The audit Team Leader will receive the drawings attached to an email.
3.6 
Checking the Drawings, Design Reports and Documents
3.6.1	
This “desktop” audit involves reviewing the drawings design reports and other 
documents in the office before and after carrying out the inspections.
3.6.2	
Take time to closely examine the drawings. Scribble on the drawings and reports as 
necessary, and mark issues to be more closely examined out on site. List the possible safety 
concerns to be checked on site, making use of the checklists as required. 
3.6.3	
When back in the office, the audit team uses the drawings and design reports again 
to double check for safety concerns now it knows more about the site and its traffic conditions.
3.6.4	
The process of reviewing the documents and inspecting the site is repeated as required 
until the audit team is satisfied that it has identified all safety concerns that can reasonably be 
expected to be identified from the drawings.
3.7	
Inspecting the Site
3.7.1	
The location of the new road proposal is to be inspected - by the entire audit team - 
during day time and again at night time.
3.7.2	
The inspection involves taking the drawings and reports of the proposal out to the site 
and inspecting the whole site – trying to imagine what the finished road project will look like and 
how it will operate. During the site inspection, the audit team should “put itself into the shoes of 
the future road users” of the road project.
3.7.3	
While on site, take lots of photographs. A few of these can be used in the audit report, 
while the entire stock of photos can serve as historical record of the audit assignment. They 
can also help the audit team to remember a specific safety concern when back in the office 
writing the audit report. Keeping a record of observations and safety findings on-site can be a 
challenge. Pen and paper will work but is often hard to manage in hot, dusty, windy, humid or wet 
conditions. Experienced auditors now tend to record their observations verbally direct on to a 
digital recorder or a smart phone. These enable more detailed observations to be recorded and 
in a shorter time. They are easier to use on-site and they give a digital record that can be stored 
in a computer for possible historical use.
3.7.4	
While inspecting the site, auditors need to anticipate whether different light (day and 
night) conditions or weather (fog, rain) conditions may create safety concerns on the completed 
road. The team is expected to look beyond the limits of the project and to include adjacent 
sections of road in the audit. Transition zones, where the new road merges into the existing 
road system can often become locations of increased risk. It is not uncommon for additional 
delineation to be recommended in the “old section” of highway by the audit team as a way of 
transitioning road users safely from the new to the existing road.



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
24
3.7.5	
Remember that the inspection should be undertaken from the point of view of all the 
likely road user groups - not just motorists. There are a wide variety of road users, each with 
quite different safety needs. It is best to consider them all while undertaking the audit.
3.8	
Writing the Road Safety Audit Report
3.8.1	
Writing the report is the responsibility of the Audit Team Leader. Other team member(s) 
should double check the report, and provide comments on it.
3.8.2	
Occasionally a section or two will be written by a team member. But in most cases, 
the Team Leader is the one who completes the report, signs it and submits it to the Project 
Manager.
3.8.3	
Audit reports are concise reports with brief, but technically clear descriptions of each of 
the safety concerns that have been identified. It is best if the report follows an agreed format; this 
makes it easier for the team to write and importantly it assists project managers and designers 
to respond. The Case Studies in Section 6 of this manual make use of the tabular format for 
presenting safety concerns and recommendations.
3.8.4	
The audit report should contain:
●	
A title page - with the name of the road project and its location.
●	
A brief description of the road project – what type of project, why it has been proposed, 
and the stage of the audit.
●	
The names of the road safety audit team members.
●	
Dates of the audit inspections and the weather conditions on-site at those times.
●	
A table of all the safety concerns found from the desktop audit as well as from the site 
inspection.
●	
A risk rating (see Section 4.6) for each safety concern.
●	
A practical and clear recommendation for corrective action for each safety concern.
●	
Digital photographs of important safety concerns linked/aligned with the road chainage 
as far as possible.
●	
A statement signed and dated by the Team Leader on behalf of the team, indicating 
that the team has audited the drawings, inspected the site and identified the road 



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
25
safety concerns noted in the report.
●	
A list of all drawings, reports and documents reviewed as part of the audit, including 
drawing numbers and dates. This may be useful for reference later as large road 
projects often have several generations of drawings. It may prove necessary at a later 
time to be quite specific about the actual drawing and design report that was audited.
3.8.5	
When writing the audit report:
●	
List all the identified safety concerns (and recommendations for each) either:
	
-	
in order from highest risk to lowest risk, or
	
-	
in groups of similar concerns (e.g. cross section matters, intersection lay out, 
geometric deficiency, pedestrian matters), or
	
-	
by chainage along the project stretch.
●	
Clearly describe each safety concern and its location.
●	
Add photographs if they can clarify a specific safety concern.
●	
Avoid being too specific with the recommendations unless certain that the specific 
recommendation is the only one.
●	
In framing a recommendation, think about high/low cost and short/long term options.
●	
Be realistic in making recommendations - take into account the level of risk associated 
with the safety concern and the cost likely to rectify it.
●	
Be constructive, clear and practical about how the safety concern might be eliminated 
or lessened.
●	
Maintain professional credibility. An audit report can often demonstrate the technical 
knowledge, skills and experience of the audit team, and especially the Team Leader.
●	
Avoid redesigning any part of the project – that is for the design team to do.
3.8.6	
An example of writing audit recommendations:
The audit team leader ensures that all audit recommendations in the report indicate the direction 
in which a solution should be sought, rather than specifying the solution. Auditors usually 
don’t know about the project constraints - if they become too prescriptive, they may prescribe 
impractical remedies to a safety concern, and in turn may end up losing credibility.
For example, during a design stage audit, an audit team discovers a steep side slope beside a 
national highway. The slope will clearly be undrivable, it will be within the clear zone and it will 
clearly be a safety concern. The drawings do not show any action proposed for this location.
Identifying and reporting the safety concern is the first and most important thing for the audit team 
to do. Being too specific with a recommendation when there are several options available can 
lead to difficulties. In this case, recommending to the Project Manager to “Install crash barrier” 
will often be seen as too prescriptive, and in some situations, it may not be the technically sound 
recommendation due to issues that are not known to the audit team. Recommending in an audit 
report to “Flatten the embankment or shield it” is just as technically sound and it guides the 



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
26
design team towards a range of options.
Therefore, when writing the audit report and developing appropriate recommendations, audit 
teams should address the following aspects:
●	
Avoid specifying solutions in too much detail.
●	
Be realistic - take into account the level of risk associated with the safety concern and 
the cost likely to rectify it.
●	
Avoid redesigning – that is for the design team to do.
●	
Remember there may be high cost/low cost and short term/long term solutions.
●	
Be constructive about how the safety concern might be eliminated or perhaps reduced.
●	
Maintain professional credibility.
Remember – the audit team “guides” but it is the responsibility of the Project Manager and the 
designers (not the audit team) to make the final decision about the solution and to arrange for 
any redesign.
3.9	
Holding a Completion Meeting
3.9.1	
The Project Manager is responsible for arranging a completion meeting involving:
●	
The Audit Team Leader,
●	
The Project Manager, and
●	
The Designer/Design team.
3.9.2	
At this meeting, the road safety audit findings and recommendations are tabled and 
discussed. The meeting provides an opportunity for the auditor, the Project Manager and the 
design team to discuss all and any issues in the report. This will usually involve a discussion 
of each safety concern, its risk rating and priority and its recommended ways to overcome the 
identified safety problem.
3.9.3	
The meeting should be held in a professional and co-operative manner with a spirit 
of all parties working together for the enhanced safety of road users. It should not become 
a meeting of blame game, or serious dispute. A safety audit is a positive activity that helps 
to improve road safety for all road users by highlighting potential safety concerns before they 
become problems.
3.9.4	
A Project Manager may ask for an audit report to be altered or to have some safety 
concerns removed. This happens rarely and it is neither professional nor ethical. In such cases, 
the Team Leader must not entertain any suggestion of altering a report to “soften” the audit 
findings.
3.9.5	
The Project Manager is required to provide his response in writing to each and every 
recommendation in the report. At that time, he/she will be able to state why a recommendation 
has not been able to be accepted. The audit process is a professional, transparent and positive 
process with one goal – to improve safety for all road users.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
27
3.9.6	
With passage of time, completion meetings might become less common. Similar to 
commencement meetings, the completion meeting will eventually give way to a transfer of the 
audit report via email to the Project Manager.
3.10	
Providing Response to the Audit Report
3.10.1	
The Project Manager is required to provide response in writing to each audit 
recommendation in the report.
He/she can either:
●	
Accept it completely (and develop solutions to overcome or reduce the safety concern); 
or
●	
Accept the safety concern but not agree to the recommendation. In these cases, he/
she will seek alternative ways to resolve the safety concern; or
●	
Not accept the recommendation (explaining clearly why this decision has been taken).
3.10.2	
To provide useful feedback, 
the Project Manager should send a 
copy of the response to the audit Team 
Leader for information. The audit team 
should note the responses and where 
possible learn from them. The team 
should be aware that they should not 
create an on-going dispute over which 
recommendations have or have not 
been accepted.
3.10.3	
As 
mentioned 
earlier, 
the audit team “guides” but it is the 
responsibility of the Project Manager and the designers (not the audit team) to make the final 
decision about the solution and to arrange for any redesign.
Deciding the way forward
3.10.4	
The audit team has quite a straight forward task – to identify all the safety concerns 
that might exist in a road design for a new road project. If there is any doubt about whether or 
not an issue is likely to become a safety concern, the usual routine is to include that issue – just 
in case!
3.10.5	
A part of the audit process that is often more challenging and demanding rests 
with the Project Manager and the road authority. How does the client decide whether or not 
to accept an audit recommendation? It is neither always possible nor practical to agree with 
all recommendations as some of these may involve large additional expenses that will affect 
progress with the project. In practice, this challenge facing the decision makers usually only arises 
with the ‘very expensive’ recommendations and occasionally with ‘complex’ recommendations; it 
rarely happens with simple and/or low cost recommendations.



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
28
3.10.6	
As a guiding principle, when faced with an audit recommendation that is difficult to 
resolve, the Project Manager needs to consider and weigh up the following aspects:
●	
How often might crashes occur? (weekly, monthly, yearly)
●	
How serious might such crashes be? (fatal, injury, property damage only),
●	
What will it cost to remedy (or at least reduce) the problem? With most safety concerns, 
there are usually several alternative remedies.
●	
How effective can each alternative be expected to be?
3.11	
Following up and Implementing Agreed Recommendations and Changes
3.11.1	
A road safety audit achieves nothing for the road users until its recommendations are 
discussed, decided and implemented.
3.11.2	
As mentioned earlier, in many audits, particularly while the project is still in the design 
stage, the changes can be made at low cost. At times, however, an audit may reveal safety 
concerns that cause difficult decisions to be made by the Project Manager, usually because the 
cost of remedial action is so high.
3.11.3	
In these cases, the usual options available to the Project Manager include:
●	
staging the improvement work over an increased period of time, possibly into the next 
financial year when more funding may be available.
●	
seeking an increase in the project budget to allow the desired countermeasures.
3.11.4	
These are all valid decisions, provided they are committed in writing in the response 
report with clear reasons given. The audit process can direct Project Managers towards a safer 
alternative but the onus lies on the Project Manager to ultimately decide on the course of action 
and its implementation. As long as all competing issues are clearly and fully considered for each 
identified safety concern, the audit team should be satisfied that its contribution has been of 
value to the project.

4. MANAGING ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
This Section outlines some of the main points in managing a road safety audit. It provides useful 
information to help to get road safety audit started in an organization, as well as information 
about developing a road safety audit policy for an organization. Essential information for those 
responsible for commissioning road safety audits is provided.
Road safety audit is a process that road authorities should embrace as part of an overall strategic 
approach to road safety. However, for those road authorities with comparatively less experience 
with road safety audits, there may be some uncertainty about how best to go about implementing 
the process into their planning/design/construction programs.
This Section provides some guidance and advice for decision makers, managers, engineers and 
staff of road authorities. It offers special assistance to those who are responsible for implementing 
the road safety audit process within their organization, or who are required to engage consultants 
or safety auditors to carry out safety audits of their road projects.
4.1 
Putting Road Safety Audit to Work in the Road Authority
For those road authorities yet to introduce the road safety audit process into their road planning/
design/construction process, the following points provide guidance about the way forward:
●	
Whether there is a formal commitment to improving road safety and this kind of support 
and empowerment is critical to creating a “safety culture” within a road authority.
●	
Include road safety in the Action Plan of organization, and commit to developing a 
Road Safety Action Plan.
●	
Develop a Road Safety Action Plan. Base it on relevant road safety strategies (such 
as existing national and state road safety strategies). There is need to include a 
programme for the treatment of hazardous road locations (a blackspot programme) 
as well as the road safety audit process.
●	
Hold an open meeting of senior technical staff to discuss and address the important 
road safety audit issues that will arise in the organization. In so doing, develop an 
audit policy and a set of basic audit practices which meet the needs of organization. 
Points that may arise in that meeting include:
	
	
How will the organization get adequate road safety audit skills and resources?
	
	
What needs to be done for the audit process to be understood by senior 
executives, managers, designers and potential auditors?
	
	
Designers may initially express reluctance at having their work audited. How 
can this be addressed?
	
	
How much training is required and for whom (departmental manager, engineers, 
designers, potential auditors)?
	
	
What road projects are to be audited in the organization? Only the largest 
projects, or only those on the busiest roads, or maybe urban only, or perhaps all 
projects above a certain cost or length.



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
30
	
	
How will road safety audit requirement be incorporated into design and 
construction contracts?
	
	
What proportion/number of projects will be audited? At what design stages will 
audits be conducted?
	
	
Who will be conducting audits? Will it be outsourced? If so, how to find and 
decide on auditors – best value for money, skills or experience? Who manages 
the panel of certified road safety auditors? Who can give advice on these issues?
	
	
How will audit recommendations be dealt with? Who will decide to accept or 
reject the more “difficult” recommendations? A formal process is required.
	
	
How will audit findings be fed back into the design process to improve future 
designs?
●	
Get started. Consider calling in a team of qualified and experienced road safety 
auditors to undertake some pilot projects of road designs. Use their findings in a 
training workshop that includes managers, designers and potential future auditors as 
participants. Practical examples are very convincing. Designers and Project Managers 
of the road authorities quickly become audit supporters when they see for themselves 
some of the safety issues that arise in some road designs.
●	
Adhere to the agreed road safety audit policy to improve designs before they are 
built. Get feedback from auditors, designers and managers and then modify the audit 
policy and the audit process to best suit the road authority as experience grows.
●	
Be prepared for some mistakes but take time to learn from those mistakes so that 
the road safety audit process can develop and grow in the organization. After gaining 
experience with design stage audits, consider undertaking safety audits of the existing 
road network (possibly in conjunction with a program of treating hazardous road 
locations).
●	
Let the senior executives know how the audit process is progressing in the organization. 
Give them examples of where road users have benefited because of the road safety 
improvements generated through the audit process, and let them know how staff 
members are learning new skills as a result of the process.
●	
Keep it going! Once road safety audit becomes established in the organization there 
can be a temptation to believe that it will happen automatically. This may or may not 
be so. Monitor the quality and the quantity of audit reports. Maintain a training and 
awareness program. Ensure that road safety audit is promoted with continued energy 
and passion.
4.2 
Options for having a Road Safety Audit undertaken 
4.2.1	
The road authority for a road project is responsible for appointing a Project Manager 
to oversee the project on its behalf. There are three key attributes that the Project Manager 
should ensure when engaging a team of road safety auditors.
The audit team should be:
●	
Qualified – satisfy the requirements laid down for a Senior Road Safety Auditor/
Auditor.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
31
●	
Experienced – demonstrated experience with the type of road project and the stage 
of audit.
●	
Independent – clearly have no previous involvement in the planning or design of the 
road project.
4.2.2	
Without a qualified and experienced audit team, the road authority may end up with an 
audit report that fails to add value to the project. If the team is not fully independent of the project, 
they could be too forgiving of some of the safety issues involved because they know of the 
design constraints that have led to them. Independence is important for the fresh identification 
of safety issues, as well as to ward off possible accusations of “soft” audits.
4.2.3	
With these key attributes in mind, the main options for getting audits done are:
●	
Engage an independent consultancy firm – have the Project Manager engage an 
experienced consultancy firm to do the audit. This option ensures that the audit is 
independent, and over time may lead to a competitive market in providing audit 
services to road authorities. A sample Terms of Reference for a road safety audit is 
given in Section 4.4.
●	
Use in-house staff – this option has the advantage that it is quick and easy to arrange, 
and it can mean that the auditors can see the scheme through to completion. It is 
necessary to ensure that the staff used are trained and experienced in road safety 
audit and are independent of the design. By adding to their practical audit experience, 
the in-house staff can develop their awareness of the audit process and they may 
therefore be more discerning when obtaining audits in the future. 
4.3	
A suggested Road Safety Audit Policy 
4.3.1	
There is a need for all staff in a road authority to be clear about what road projects are 
to be audited and at what stages this should be done. It is equally important to ensure that road 
safety audit becomes firmly established in a road authority.
4.3.2	
Both of these needs are best satisfied by formulating a road safety audit policy by the 
authority.
4.3.3	
Such a policy should detail the type of road project to be audited, the stage(s) of 
audit that will be undertaken and the reporting and response systems. The policy should be 
disseminated widely to all professionals in the road authority, as well as to all professionals who 
have dealings with the authority on road and safety related matters.
4.3.4	
An example of a draft road safety audit policy for the road authority is given below. It is 
to be remembered that any policy (whether about road safety audits or any other subject) should 
be a “living” document. It should be reviewed and updated as experience with the process grows 
within the road authority.
“Road projects to be undertaken by the [insert name of road authority] will be road safety audited 
at the following stages (refer Table 4.1) according to the class of the road, in accordance with the 
procedures contained in IRC:SP:88 titled, “Manual on Road Safety Audit”:

The road authority should consider the resources available and the demands for the coming years 
in formulating its audit policy. Once agreed, the policy should be widely promoted throughout the 
authority so that staff is aware of its importance and to confirm that they use it to guide them in 
their audit work.

Risk Assessment of Safety Concerns and Prioritization of Suggested 
Recommendations	
4.6.1	
When an audit report contains a number of safety concerns, the client/road authority 
need assistance to assess the risk involved in the safety concerns and also priority level in which 
recommendations can be adopted.
4.6.2	
Risk is often defined as the likelihood (frequency) of an event times the consequence 
(severity) of that event. Table 4.2 gives simple criteria for the risk involved in the safety concerns 
assessed by the safety auditor. It is a qualitative assessment process and it requires professional 
judgment of the Audit Team.
Table 4.2 Criteria for Risk Assessment
Severity
Description
Examples
Very High
Multiple deaths are likely
High speed, multi-vehicle crashes on expressways. 
A bus collision at high speed with a bridge abutment.
High
A death and/or serious injuries 
are likely
High/medium speed vehicle/vehicle collisions. 
High/medium speed collisions with a fixed roadside 
object. Pedestrian crashes on rural highways.
Medium
Minor injuries only are likely
Low speed collisions, such as a three-wheeler 
colliding with a bicyclist, a rear end crash in a slip 
lane, or a pedestrian struck in a car park.
4.6.3	
Table 4.3 gives guidance for a safety auditor in assigning priority level for each 
recommendation that can be considered by the Client/Project Manager in view of the constraints 
in implementing.
Table 4.3 Assigning Priority Level for Suggested Recommendations
Priority
Suggested Treatment Approach
Essential
Where risk is assessed as Very High, the recommendation shall be 
implemented “at any cost”.
Highly Desirable
Where risk is assessed as High, the recommendation shall be implemented 
unless cost of remedial treatment is prohibitive and risk can be reduced by 
an alternative measure.
Desirable
Where risk is assessed as Medium, the recommendation shall be 
implemented if the safety concerns could not be mitigated even after the 
implementation of the recommendations under “essential;” and ‘highly 
desirable’ priority levels for the same location and the risk needs to be 
reduced further.

5. PRACTICES FOR SAFER ROADS
A member of a road safety audit requires examining project drawings, inspecting the site and 
making decisions about what may be potentially unsafe in the drawings, at the worksite or on the 
finished road. He/she is expected to understand the audit process, and to be knowledgeable in 
the field of road safety engineering. He is expected to exercise sound judgement in determining 
what might, and what might not, be a road safety concern when the project is built.
Auditors therefore need to be knowledgeable and experienced in most, if not all, aspects of the 
road safety engineering profession.
5.1	
Starting your Audit
5.1.1	
When you set out to conduct an audit, ask yourself a few simple questions about the 
drawings:
●	
Is the proposed cross section suitably safe for the road classification?
●	
Do the horizontal and vertical alignments suggest any features that may warrant 
special consideration?
●	
Will the new road be easily understood by the road users (motorised and non-
motorised)?
●	
Do any parts of the design present direct risk to any group of future road users?
●	
Are any roadside hazards obvious?
●	
Has enough been done to assist the safety of vulnerable road users – moving along 
as well as across the new road?
●	
Will weather conditions present safety issues for the new road? Will the new road be 
safe at night?
●	
If any of these trigger a potential safety concern in your mind, start to think about what 
may be possible to alter in the design now in a positive manner to improve safety?
●	
After these questions you will begin to go into more and more detail. The checklists 
(See Section 7) are provided to help and guide and remind you of some of the safety 
issues to look out for.
5.1.2	
Remember the general aim of an audit is to produce a new road that is as safe as 
reasonably practical. Ask yourself, will the new road:
●	
Warn
●	
Inform
●	
Guide
●	
Control
●	
Forgive
5.1.3	
From experience with road safety audits, a few common safety concerns emerge 
frequently. In order to promote safety for all road users and to raise awareness of these common 
safety concerns, the following sections give some brief advice on the safest way forward.



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 128
======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019

Vulnerable Road Users
5.1.4	
The country has a mix of traffic that is perhaps unique in the world. Pedestrians, 
bicyclists, motorcyclists, rickshaws and animal drawn carts mix with cars, trucks buses and 
countless other vehicles at all times of day and night. This presents special challenges for road 
designers and road safety auditors.
5.1.5	
One of the most important things that the member of an audit team can do is to 
put himself into the shoes of the vulnerable road user. You should walk the site, ride a bicycle 
through the site, maybe use a rickshaw at the site and try to foresee the special safety needs of 
these large groups of road users.
5.1.6	
Many safety enhancements can be 
made to help these groups. Mostly they start with 
an appreciation of the real needs of the users and 
a general principle not to impose restrictions on 
their mobility. Such actions are rarely successful. 
Instead, try to work with these road users and 
provide simple low cost enhancements that can 
assist their mobility and their safety.
Night Time Visibility
5.1.7	
Roads are used both day and night, and 
so they should be inspected during night time as 
well as day time. Some locations look very different 
at night; they may or may not have street lighting. 
Some street lighting can create visual deceit. Older 
people generally have poorer eyesight and this 
makes reading road signs more difficult than it is 
for younger people. This is made worse after dark, 
so particular attention should be paid to night time 
conspicuity and visibility for the elderly. Perception 
of widths and distances by older drivers also 
becomes more difficult at night time.
Visual Deceit
5.1.8	
At some locations, visual cues along 
a road may give the wrong message to a small 
number of drivers/riders. A long row of trees, or 
power lines, can give an impression that the road 
continues straight. Then, if the road takes a bend, 
some drivers will be misled by the trees or the power 
poles and may proceed in the wrong direction. This 
can occur regardless of the number of warning or 
guide signs telling them otherwise. This “visual 
deceit” can be strong; audit teams need to consider 
it and report on it as and when necessary.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
38
Speed Management
5.1.9	
High speed is a major contributor in serious crashes. Auditors should check the 
drawings to ensure that the operating speeds of the new road can be managed within levels that 
are appropriate for the design speed of the road.
5.1.10	
Firstly, ensure that the design speed and the likely operating speeds match each 
other. Otherwise some drivers may be caught by surprise at curves.
5.1.11	
Secondly, be satisfied that there will be a suitable speed limit imposed. This will need 
adequate speed restriction signs along the route to remind drivers/riders of the speed limit.
5.1.12	
Thirdly, consider the need to reduce 
operating speeds through “self-enforcing” measures 
such as traffic calming in towns and villages (such 
as gateway treatments, raised crossings, road 
narrowing) or by speed enforcement (such as 
speed cameras).
5.2	
Technical Tips for Audit Teams: Warn, 
Inform, Guide, Control and Forgive
During every audit you should ask these basic 
questions – will the future road users be warned, informed, guided, controlled and forgiven on 
the new road? The answers you get will help your audit.

Warn 
Warnings can be given by signs, pavement 
markings or rumble strips. The message should 
be clear and simple. Will more warnings be 
necessary on the new road?

Inform 
Information is best provided in small amounts, 
and drivers are not overloaded with too many 
destination names to be read and take action 
on high speed to take decision on approaches 
to junction. Direction signs and lane direction 
arrows are examples of providing necessary 
information to drivers/riders. Does the design 
show enough information for safety and fonts are 
bigger enough to be read by driver on approach 
speed?  What about the position from junction to 
be seen by driver for minimum visibility distance?


Guide
Road users may need additional guidance at 
some locations - such as where their route 
changes direction unexpectedly. This occurs 
often at road work diversions and at sharp curves 
on hill roads. There must be no surprises on 
roads. Do the road works, or does the design for 
the new road, need additional devices to guide 
the future road users?

Control
Safe control of intersections is a necessary 
part of a safe road network. If two roads are 
intersecting, both having comparable traffic 
volume uncontrolled T intersection would be 
unsafe, where roundabout would be a safe traffic 
control. Does the design have other additional 
traffic control devices for safety? If the roundabout 
is getting locked few hours, can it be signalized 
roundabout to control for those few hours and 
remaining hours would operate as roundabout 
with priority from rule to have traffic control during 
lean hours also, as normal roundabout for round 
the clock safe traffic control.

Forgive
What is the clear zone for the project? Has the 
roadside hazard management strategy been 
applied? What can be done to manage any 
remaining roadside hazards to reduce the risk to 
the occupants of vehicles that leave the road? 
Barrier should be your last option; if used it must 
be installed correctly.
5.3	
Technical Tips for Audit Teams: Safety Elements in Junction Layouts
Various geometric elements are critical for safe maneuvering of vehicle in priority, roundabout 
and signal controlled junctions.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019

Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Unsafe Layout)
Too much deceleration length in storage 
lane side promotes illegitimate overtaking by 
through traffic. Tapering for acceleration for 
right turning movement will create wide area 
effect and could be used by through people 
and the storage lane will be encroached by 
through movement. Wide open area on side 
road creates uncontrolled reckless movement
Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Safe Layout) 
Storage length shall be the optimum length 
based on right turning traffic volume or for 
actual deceleration length. Median tip shall 
be reshaped in such a way that storage lane 
would remain neutral, not to be encroached 
by through movement. On side road, provide 
triangular island of more than 6sqm and 
splitter island of minimum 1.5m width to serve 
as refuge space for pedestrians and also to 
install signs and would remain intact, without 
being hit by vehicles.
Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Unsafe Layout)
By virtue of skewed joining, side road merges 
at high speed and unable to see the high speed 
traffic coming from main carriageway. In order 
to facilitate right turn movement from side road 
to main, median opening kept high. Median 
opening is eccentrically located, resulting in 
high speed exit from main road to side road.
 
Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Safe Layout)
Side road alignment has been brought nearly 
perpendicular that side road to main road and 
main road to side road turning movement would 
take place at controlled speed. Median opening 
has been kept not more than 20m to avoid 
reckless movement at junction. Vegetation and 
other boards that obscure visibility have been 
removed from central median for a length of 
safe stopping distance to enhance the mutual 
visibility of traffic approaching junction.

Main Road Cross Section
Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Safer and Unsafe Practice)
When a side road traffic joins the main road, it 
has to wait to get a gap. If the vertical profile 
of intersecting  minor road is not flat enough, it 
would be difficult for vehicles to wait in climbing 
position at the Stop Line as it is expected any 
vehicle entering from minor road should obey 
the 'Stop Sign' and 'Stop Line' ear marked on 
the minor road. Hence it is advisable that the 
minor road shall be flat for a minimum distance 
of 5 and desirably up to 10 m if the proportion 
of goods traffic entering from the minor road is 
substantial.
Encumbrance Free
Visibility Funnel

Minor Road
Geometric elements in Priority Junction 
(Safer and Unsafe Practice) 
When a side road traffic joins the main road, 
it has to see the gap in the main road to turn 
right or left and sometime cross to other side. If 
the visibility funnel is occupied, it would really 
affect the mutual visibility of traffic in main road 
and that coming from side road. Hence visibility 
funnel shall always be kept encumbrance free.
Safe Junction Control
Geometric elements in Roundabout (Safe 
Layout)
Position of central island should be such 
that through movement of traffic even from 
extreme left land should not take place. Island 
on approach road to roundabout should be 
deflecting that approach speed gets reduced, 
so as to give priority to traffic already in the 
circulatory carriageway.

Technical Tips for Audit Teams: Roadside Hazards
5.4.1	
Roadside hazard management
Roadside hazards are a major road safety risk. The five part strategy for managing roadside 
hazards can guide a road safety audit team in their roadside hazard management.
	
Step 1 - Keep vehicles on the road
	
Step 2 - Remove fixed objects from within the “clear zone” of the road



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
42
	
Step 3 - Relocate hazards to locations outside the “clear zone” 
	
Step 4 - Alter the hazard to reduce the severity of a collision
	
Step 5 - Install crash barrier to shield errant vehicles from the hazard
1
Has enough been done to keep vehicles on the road?
A combination of good geometrical design, good information for drivers and good 
maintenance of the road is needed. An early stage of audit (such as planning/feasibility) 
can focus on geometric design and sealed shoulders to minimize run-off-road risk. In later 
audits, other safety options to reduce run-off-road crashes such as tactile edge lines, 
warning signs, guideposts and chevron alignment markers should be questioned if not 
shown in the drawings.
2
Remove fixed objects from the clear zone
What clear zone has been used in the design? Is it appropriate? What fixed objects (defined 
as those with a diameter of 100mm or greater) remain in the clear zone? They should be 
removed, if possible.
3
Relocate hazards from the roadside
(to a position outside the “clear zone”)
If it is not possible to remove a fixed object from the clear zone, the next option is to relocate 
it further off the road. Is this feasible? Experience and judgement is necessary in such 
cases and the actions in Steps 4 and/or 5 may be brought in at this point. For example, a 
lighting column pole may be able to be relocated 8 metres further from the road, but it will 
be less effective in lighting the road from there. The team may recommend a 4m relocation 
and a slip based lighting column as a safer option.
4
Alter the hazard to reduce the severity of a collision
Safer forms of road furniture now exist. Large signs can be placed on “weakened” sign 
posts. Frangible lighting columns are available (slip based or impact absorbent) to absorb 
the energy of an impacting vehicle and reduce injuries. Drivable end walls for culverts can 
reduce injuries.
5
Install crash barrier to shield errant vehicles from the hazard
When the first four steps in the strategy have been exhausted, the installation of crash 
barriers may be the only remaining option. The purpose of crash barriers is to protect the 
humans who are inside an errant vehicle from striking a more serious roadside hazard. 
Audit teams should understand that even a crash barrier is a fixed object, and can cause 
injury when struck. If used, the audit team will need to check they are correctly designed and 
installed in accordance with IRC:119. Safe end terminals are important. Traffic attenuators 
can be provided to shield a hazard at gore area i.e. traffic bifurcation location, complying 
general criteria for provision given in IRC:SP:87, IRC:84 and IRC:SP:99 respectively for 
6 lane, 4 lane and Expressway Manual.

5.4.2	
Installation of Roadside Barriers
5.4.2.1	
It is common for designers to propose crash barrier in a design when roadside 
hazards are known to exist beside a project road. However, barrier should only be installed 
when the severity of a crash with a hazard will be greater than a crash with the barrier itself. 
Crash barriers are roadside hazards; they can be especially dangerous if they are not correctly 
designed and installed. Therefore, after assessing that barrier is required, auditors should check 
that the correct type has been selected and that it has been designed correctly?
5.4.2.2	
Auditors should look closely at the standard drawings for the barrier details. The 
correct design and installation of crash barrier is a skilled task. Audit teams may need to refer 
to technical guidelines in IRC for more information. Some may even decide to add an additional 
expert on the team to assist in deliberations about the crash barrier.
5.4.2.3	
Crash barrier shall be long enough to fully shield the hazard. Short lengths of barrier 
are a common safety concern in audit reports!
5.4.2.4 	
Lateral placement of the barrier is very critical. It shall be such that a bumper of an 
errant vehicle hits crash barrier before its wheel touches, if at all kerb has been provided.  Also, 
barrier shall be sufficiently offset from the hazard sufficiently to accommodate deflection of the 
barrier? If at all the barrier is installed some distance from paved edge, the distance between 
paved edge and barrier shall be uniformly grade not more 1:10 slope and kept intact. 
5.4.2.5	
Ensure that the barrier height, overlap of the metal beam, orientation of posts is 
correct as per standard and safe end terminal have been provided.
5.4.2.6	
Removing a hazard is the best option for an audit early enough in the DPR process.

Technical Tips for Auditors: Road Signs & Pavement Markings 
5.5.1	
Avoid using signs as a quick or cheap “fix” to all safety issues. They may be an 
acceptable solution to some safety issues; however, you should discuss whether or not a sign 
is the best solution to a problem. If you decide to recommend the use of a sign it is necessary to 
remember the basic principles of good signing, and then check for these in later stage audits.

5.5.2	
Pavement markings play an important role in the safety performance. Significance of 
marking is that driver cannot get rid of pavement marking as he drives on road; hence a properly 
laid marking as per codal provisions would give clear cut message and would definitely influence 
driving behavior.
Road Signs
X
Conspicuous
The sign must be able to be seen. This is a 
new and reflective sign but it has been poorly 
located and it cannot be seen by drivers/
riders. If a sign cannot be seen, it cannot be 
of any use to the road users.
X
Clear
The shape and colour of the sign, as well 
as the legend/symbol, have to be able to be 
read from a suitable distance. This sign is no 
longer able to be read.
X
Comprehensible
All signs have to be able to be understood. 
Using standard signs is a good starting 
point as drivers become used to the sign 
colour/shape/meaning. This non-standard 
direction sign could leave some drivers 
confused. Driver confusion leads to errors 
and sometimes crashes. Auditors should 
guard against situations that can lead to 
driver confusion.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:88-2019
45
X
Credible
The message conveyed by a sign has to 
be believable. This sign informs drivers of a 
narrow bridge. It is not the standard warning 
sign for a narrow bridge but importantly the 
road remains at full width across the bridge. 
The sign is incorrect as it leads to a lack of 
sign credibility.
X
Consistent
Each sign used for a task should look the 
same as each other sign used for that task. 
There is a standard “Road Worker” warning 
sign for use at road work sites. But the sign at 
the road works in this photo is quite different 
from the standard “Road Worker” warning 
sign. Such inconsistency leads to a decrease 
in driver compliance with signs.
X
Correct
Every sign used should be the correct sign 
for the purpose. It may be better not to use a 
sign than to use the wrong sign!
This “Keep Left” sign is conspicuous, but it 
is not the correct (legally enforceable) sign.
X
Design
Sign design shall be uniform as per guidelines 
given in IRC:67. For a driver to read in a 
moving position, only one destination for 
forward destination and one destination on 
right destination. The other destination with 
distances can be placed immediately after 
the junction to reassurance sign and could 
be on small font size as it is to be seen by 
a driver after negotiating a junction at low 
speed.

Placement
Placement of sign really matters. Picture here 
shows that STOP sign placed 40m ahead. 
Placement of signs also shall be governed 
as per IRC:67.
Pavement Markings

Clear space for
Edge line from Kerb
Carriageway
Edge line
Kerb
Set Back Distance for Edge Line
Edge line marked on roads has tremendous 
bearing on road safety. If edge line is placed 
very close to kerb, it is generally covered 
by soil, dirt and even stagnated water. To 
address this issue, a shyness distance of 
0.5m shall be provided from the vertical face 
of kerb/edge and shall be kept clean for the 
continued  performance of edge line.

Low 
Cost 
Measures 
to 
Discourage 
Overtaking
A sharp curve with restricted forward visibility 
could be witnessing head on collision 
crashes. Providing a central median shall be 
the durable solution. But any median at the 
center of traffic movement shall be of 1.5m 
to accommodate signs to make the hazard 
visible at the middle of the road. Reasonable 
width is required to serve as refuge space for 
a pedestrian to cross. Minimum 5.5m paved 
width is required on one side of physical 
median to allow passage of two vehicles. In 
such situation, psychological median made 
of ladder hatching as shown will be a solution 
to discourage head on collision

 
Hazard Marking where Paved width gets 
reduced
In hazardous location where paved width 
gets reduced and will be challenge to 
discourage drivers to align to reduced paved 
width as shown here. Hence, hazardous 
marking shown for 100 to 200m ahead of 
reduced width will be a solution, as detailed 
in IRC:35.

Marking that affects Users’ Behavior
Physical island enveloped by marked island 
would be a safer practice, wherein the 
physical island is set back in line with edge 
of paved shoulder. This will prevent island 
hit accident if a vehicle attempts to move 
forward using the paved shoulder. The width 
of the slip lane can be marked in such a way 
that two vehicles would not run parallel while 
turning. As a result the marked island will 
be much larger than the physical island and 
island would be much conspicuous.
 5.6	
Technical Tips for Auditors:  Pedestrians
Pedestrians are the largest and most vulnerable group of road users. Use signalised crossings 
to give pedestrians time separation from vehicles to cross busy roads. Use medians or refuges 
to give them spatial separation from vehicles. Overpasses/subways are not popular and should 
only be used as a “last resort” to segregate pedestrians and vehicles on roads with high speeds 
and high traffic volumes.



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
48
High Risk Pedestrians 
An audit team needs to consider the safety 
needs of all pedestrians, and in particular 
the safety needs of high risk groups such as 
school-aged pedestrians, elderly pedestrians, 
the disabled and intoxicated pedestrians.
In the Shoes of the Pedestrian 
The audit team should walk the site (day 
and night) to check for pedestrian issues. 
Pedestrians need to be able to clearly see 
where they should go. While this may be clear 
to engineers on a plan, it is not always obvious 
on the ground.
Footpaths
Footpaths are desirable to provide pedestrians 
with their own space on which to walk, 
especially in urban areas. Auditors should 
check to ensure they are wide enough for 
the expected volumes, and are continuous. 
Wherever gaps are unavoidable, proper 
ramps should be provided to cater for elderly 
and differently abled people. In later audit 
stages, they should check that kerb crossings 
are provided and the footpaths are clear of 
obstacles.

Paved Shoulders
In rural areas, wherever there is considerable 
pedestrian movement near inhabited areas, 
schools etc., paved shoulders will give 
pedestrians their own space on which to walk. 
They also help bicyclists, motorcyclists and 
animal drawn carts. Auditors should check the 
cross sectional drawings and question if paved 
shoulders are not proposed in such stretches.

Legitimate space for Pedestrians
Highway passing through a settlement should 
have space for pedestrian movement along and 
across the carriageway. Pedestrians should be 
able to cross the traffic way in shortest distance 
not more than two array of vehicles. Median 
width also should be wide enough to serve as 
a refuge space. Considering the mix of traffic 
occupying urban roads, a lane width can be 
reduced to give proper width for the pedestrians.

User friendly Footpath 
The line and grade of footpath, especially at 
locations side/access road comes, it should be 
such that it can be user friendly, lest perhaps

The maintenance of footpath is of utmost 
importance and footpath should not have 
unexpected openings and hazardous things 
causing pedestrians to avoid using them.

6. SAFETY AUDIT CASE STUDIES AND REPORTING 
This section gives the results of four road safety audits of roads. The main audit findings are summarized 
and are presented in a standard format. The layout of these audit reports, including the tabular presentation 
of the audit findings, is suggested to be a useful template for use in road safety audit reports. To have 
uniformity, the issues are arranged in the order as in the checklist. It also allows space for the Project 
Manager to provide response to each recommendation. 
Four case studies showcase some of the safety concerns that typically arise at different stages of audit 
and on different types of road projects. The focus in these case studies is on design stage, construction 
stage, pre-opening stage audits including existing road audit. The four case studies show audits of 
different road projects. One of the projects is audited at two stages (DPR and pre-opening) to show the 
relative differences in the typical safety concerns that might be identified in an early versus a later stage 
of audit.
6.1	
Case Study 1: DPR Stage Audit
6.1.1	
The project corridor taken up for rehabilitation and widening of a state highway between km 
86.0 and km 142.0 has been subjected to road safety audit by reviewing the Detailed Project Report 
(DPR) and drawings of the above project corridor by a two member RSA team.
6.1.2	
Audit Team
Two team members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor have been involved in the above RSA.
6.1.3 
Project Background
A 56 km section of two-lane two-way state highway is to be rehabilitated and widened. This section of 
highway commences in a flat area of rural land and is basically straight and flat for the first half until it 
reaches a wooded hill area for the second 28 km. The road is presently 6m wide (2 x 3m lanes) with 
unsealed 1m wide shoulders along both sides. The proposal shows a 7m wide pavement (2 x 3.5m wide 
lanes) and unsealed 1.5m wide shoulders on both sides. An 80km/h design speed has been used for the 
flat section and a 50km/h design speed has been used in the hill section. The highway passes through 
two towns and eight villages. Ten new bus lay-bys are included in the proposal. No change is proposed 
to the six existing bridges.
6.1.4	
Audit Details
The road authority requests a road safety audit of the DPR. The Project Manager selects a road safety 
audit team and provides him with the ToRs for the audit. The senior auditor, on viewing the size and stage 
of the project, invites a colleague to join him in the audit team.
6.1.5	
The Project Manager has the design team which provided the audit team with a complete set 
of the latest drawings, as well as the design report prepared for the project corridor.
6.1.6	
The team then travels to the location of the proposed highway rehabilitation; they inspect the 
entire length during day and night. The audit team also inspects the highway for a few kilometres outside 
the 56km long section in order to check that those nearby areas won’t become high risk locations after 
the work is finished and traffic speeds increase.
6.1.7 	
Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All the titles 
of issues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the checklist shall be 
verified and all issues shall be reported with exact location in the road safety audit of the given road. 
Being a sample report, only a few issues are picked up and shown below:

Horizontal & Vertical Alignment
1.1
The left hand curve near km 128.9 has a much shorter 
radius than any other curve in this section of the highway. 
It will be one of the “sharpest” curves on the entire 
highway. Some drivers/riders, especially those travelling 
westwards (downhill) may be caught by surprise at the 
small radius of this curve, and run- off-road crashes could 
result. The drawings are silent about what is intended to 
address this risk.

If this is not feasible, ensure that the 
shoulders are paved on both sides of 
the highway for at least 100 m either 
side of the apex of the curve. Ensure 
the outer shoulder is sloped to match 
the super elevation of the carriageway 
at that point.

The vertical grade has been changed at short distance and 
even with broken back curves as shown here with a reason 
of minimizing the profile correction course. Traffic plying 
through this road section could be multi-axle trucks, and 
sometimes even carrying liquid commodities, where the 
frequent changes of vertical grade will make the centre of 
gravity to oscillate, leading to toppling of vehicles.

Typical Cross Sections
2.1
  
The drawings show a 1.5 m wide unpaved shoulder along 
both sides of the highway. Unpaved shoulders discourage 
vulnerable road users from walking/riding on them as 
shown in picture (especially during the monsoon period). 
They become damaged when heavy vehicles drive on 
them. This can lead to deep drop-offs from the pavement 
which in turn becomes a hazard for small vehicles. 
There are many pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists 
using this highway. They need the protection of a paved 
shoulder.
High
Review the proposed cross section to 
provide a paved 1.5m wide shoulder 
along both sides of the highway for the 
entire project highway.
Desirable
If paved shoulder cannot be provided 
for entire project highway, provide at 
least for the section where pedestrians 
and 
bicyclists 
are 
predominately 
present like villages and settlements.
Highly

This highway passes through two towns and 8 villages. 
Traffic speeds at present are quite low because of the road 
condition. However, when the highway is rehabilitated 
and widened, speeds will increase. For the safety of 
vulnerable road users in the towns and villages, it will be 
vital to manage speeds on the new highway. 
High
Install Gateways on both sides of the 
highway at the entrance to each town

Case Study 2: Construction Stage Audit
6.2.1	
Construction stage road safety audit of the upgrading of a 235 km section of National 
Highway.
6.2.2	
Audit Team
A team of three members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor have been involved in the 
Construction Stage RSA. Ideally, such types of construction stage RSA should be conducted at 
every 3 to 4 month interval till the project corridor is declared ready for pre-opening stage RSA by 
the audit team. After each of the construction stage RSA visits, compliance need to be submitted 
by the client to the audit team. 
6.2.3 
Project Background
A 235 km section of a National Highway between two major regional cities is to be upgraded. 
One section (65 km) will be upgraded to become a 4-lane divided highway; the remainder will 
be widened to become a six lane divided highway. There will be 17 new flyovers and four new 
interchanges in this major road project. The Contractor has decided to reduce construction time 
by having up to 12 work sites underway at the same time.
6.2.4	
Audit Details
The road authority requests a road safety audit of the road works. The Project Manager decides 
to engage an audit team of three members as he considers that this highway improvement is a 
significant one that will benefit from a larger audit team. The Project Manager ensures the team 
size is made clear in the ToRs for the audit.
6.2.5	
This is the first safety audit that has been conducted on this project. No design stage 
audits were conducted. The Project Manager therefore decides to hold a commencement 
meeting to discuss the project and the audit.
6.2.6	
The audit team begins by undertaking a “desktop” audit of the traffic management 
plans for the construction work and subsequently carried out the audit.
6.2.7	
Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All the 
titles of issues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the

6.3  Case Study 3 : Pre-opening Stage 
 Audit 
6.3.1	
 Pre-opening stage road safety audit of the rehabilitation and widening of the state 
highway between km 76.0 and km 142.0.
6.3.2	
Audit Team
A team of three members including a Senior Road Safety Auditor have been involved in the 
Pre-opening Stage RSA. Ideally, any road subjected to pre-opening stage RSA should have 
undergone audit starting from Design Stage RSA followed by Construction Stage RSA at every 3 
to 4 month interval. It is expected all the pending safety issues pointed out in the previous stages 
of RSA as well as any other new minor safety related issues have to be addressed by the client 
as the RSA team would not suggest any major changes to the project corridor at this stage. This 
is because after the completion of Pre-Opening Stage RSA and the submission of compliance 
letter by the road owning agencies, the road would be opened to traffic operations. After the 
road is opened for traffic operations, it is also prudent to solicit the views of the road users by 
conducting the roadside questionnaire survey on the project corridor. This survey should focus 
primarily on any of the missing road safety issues, on the Project Corridor and the same should 
be conducted within 3 to 4 months from the start of normal traffic operations.   
6.3.3 
Project Background
A 66 km section of road section comprises of 10 km of 4-lane divided bypass of an industrial 
town and remaining 56 km of two-lane two-way highway has been rehabilitated and widened. 
The highway commences in a flat rural area and leads into a hill area. The 4-lane divided 
carriageway comprises of 2 x 7.25 m wide carriageway with 1.5 m wide paved shoulder and 
4.5 m wide median and 2-lane road section comprises of 7m wide pavement (2 x 3.5 m wide 
lanes) and unsealed 1.5 m wide shoulders on both sides. Km 76 to 86 of 4-lane section has not 
been audited in the design stage. But the km 86 to 142 km has been audited and as a result in 
the towns and villages, within one kilometer of each and on selected curves, the shoulders have 
been sealed as a result of the DPR stage audit recommendations. 
6.3.4	
Audit Details
The road authority requests a road safety audit of the new work. The Project Manager decides to 
engage the same audit team which had previously (20 months earlier) audited the DPR drawings. 
6.3.5	
The audit team spends time inspecting the finished roads as well as the drawings 
to consider as what recommendations can be included even at this stage of pre-opening audit 
causing least disturbance to contract and time over run. They visited the site both during day and 
night and also received the “Good for Construction” drawings.
6.3.6	
 Format of a road safety audit report is presented in the prescribed template. All 
the titles of issues as listed in the checklist are reproduced to impress that all issues as in the 
checklist shall be verified and all issues shall be reported with exact location in the road safety 
audit of the given road.  Being a sample report, only a few issues are picked up in the report and 
shown below.

When a side road traffic joins the main road, it has 
to wait to get a gap. In the picture shown here, it 
would be impossible for 2 wheelers to stop to wait in 
climbing position, rather they take the risk to enter 
the main road  that may lead to major accidents.

Four informal openings appear to have been created 
through the median – possibly by nearby people who 
wish to minimize their travel distances. However 
such informal openings create high risk situations 
as they are not provided with proper signage, they 
do not have sheltered turn lanes in which turning 
vehicles can slow and stop. In addition, the median 
often becomes damaged and sand/gravel is drawn 
onto the road, creating a skidding hazard.

The curves in the hill area have been delineated 
inconsistently. Several (such as at km 124.4 and km 
125.5) have many Chevron signs installed. However, 
others have Chevron signs  in one direction only and 
the other direction is not delineated. Several curves 
that need Chevron signs  have none. At one curve, 
the Chevron signs are incorrectly installed on the 
inside of the curve. Such inconsistent delineation 
can cause some drivers/riders to be caught by 
surprise and run-off-road crashes could result.

“fish tail” end. These have a bad history of spearing 
an impacting vehicle and they should not be used. 
In addition, barrier has not been installed at the 
other two bridges (on either approach).
W beam barrier has been installed at four of the six 
bridges to shield the side slope on each approach. 
None of the barrier has been stiffened nor correctly 
affixed to the bridge parapets. There is a risk of 
pocketing at these bridges.

Crash barrier has been installed to shield a number 
of roadside hazards. Most of the barrier installations 
appear adequate but there are six sections (all 
between km 12-14) that are too short. The barrier is 
too short to fully shield the hazard and it is possible 
that some errant vehicles may pass behind or in 
front of the barrier to strike the hazard.
The ramped down terminals are another safety 
concern that should not have been installed.

7. ROAD SAFETY AUDIT CHECKLISTS
While engineers may be described as problem solvers, road safety auditors are best thought of 
as problem finders! To help them in their problem finding work, a set of checklists can be a useful 
memory jogger.
7.1 
The Purpose of these Checklists
7.1.1	
The following set of checklists has been developed for use in road safety audits. 
They include references to the typical road types and road projects that are common. The 
checklists remind audit teams to always consider the safety needs of the vulnerable road users 
(pedestrians, bicyclists, rickshaw pullers and three wheelers) in equal measure to the safety 
needs of motorised road users (car, truck and bus users).
7.1.2	
Checklists are intended to reduce the risk that important safety concerns may be 
overlooked during an audit. However they cannot be a substitute for knowledge or for experience. 
The use of the checklists also requires sound judgement.
7.1.3	
Checklists should therefore be considered as a list of reminders to help in audit. 
There are different road projects on different types of roads and in many varied topographical 
locations. Therefore these checklists may, or may not, be fully applicable to all road projects. Be 
prepared to expand each list as and when necessary.
7.1.4	
These checklists are intended to be photocopied. It is recommended that the originals 
are kept intact for subsequent audits. The photocopies can be taken on site and used as 
necessary. The completed checklists are kept by the audit team for future reference. It is not 
necessary to attach completed checklists to an audit report or to pass them to the Client.
7.1.5 	
The road safety audit report is the necessary deliverable from an audit.
7.2 
When and how to use the Checklists
7.2.1	
There are five recognised stages of audit in India, including the road safety audit of 
existing roads. Checklists for each stage are contained in this Section.
7.2.2	
It is suggested that the audit team leader uses the checklists as follows:
●	
Determine which checklist is needed, based on the stage of the project.
●	
Have the checklist(s) photocopied. Use the copy for the desktop audit and the site 
inspection.
●	
Remind team members that a successful audit is not achieved simply by just ticking 
off each item on the checklist. The topics in each checklist cover only the common 
elements of a road project; they are detailed but are not exhaustive.
●	
Remember too that some checklist items may not be relevant to the project being 
audited. Auditors need to therefore exercise their own judgement about the safety 
of any feature in the design of the project. This is where knowledge, experience and 
judgement are paramount.



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 128
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2019
82
●	
Audit team members are encouraged to think broadly about the safety of the future 
road users of the road project and not to be restricted only to items on the checklists.
●	
The checklists have been so worded that a negative answer (NO) to any question 
means that there is a safety issue that may need to be included in the audit report.
●	
A positive (YES) answer given to any question means that issue has been examined 
but is not considered likely to present a safety issue to the future road users.
●	
The NA (Not Applicable) column is provided for completeness as there will be many 
occasions when some items on the checklists are not relevant to the proposal being 
audited.
●	
Add notes in the Comments column as felt necessary to remind to alert the audit team 
where the safety issues are located and what they are.
●	
Some auditors may elect to use digital recorders or mobile phones to record their 
observations while on site. This is often easier than writing notes on the copies of 
the checklists and it can provide an opportunity for more details to be recorded in a 
shorter period of time.
7.3

Comments
1.	
Road Design Standards
Are the design standards being used appropriate (considering 
the class of terrain, mix of traffic including Vulnerable Road 
Users and the function of the proposed road)?
Has the design speed been adopted considering the hierarchy 
of Road and mix of traffic including Vulnerable Road Users?
Will the likely speed limit on the proposed road be compatible 
with the design speed and mix of traffic, non-motorized traffic 
including pedestrians?
Does the route fit in with the physical constraints imposed by 
the topography?
Does the project road relieve routes or sites with bad accident 
records?
Check for consistency throughout the route; note any location 
where alignment standard changes abruptly and is not as 
would be expected by drivers.
2.	
Alignment
Will the design speed be “safe” with regard to horizontal and 
vertical alignment?
Does the alignment (horizontal and vertical) give sufficient 
forward visibility for the selected design speed? (Check for 
inadequate stopping sight distances)?
Will horizontal and vertical alignments be safe and consistent, 
especially at interchanges and intersections?
Will all merging, diverging and weaving areas be “safe”?
Is the proposal consistent with the adjacent road network?
Do the horizontal and vertical alignments fit together 
comfortably? (Check for bad combinations, such as a sharp 
bend immediately after a summit curve, and sag curve within 
a bend).

No
NA
Comments
Will sight distances be satisfactory – especially at intersections 
and property accesses?
Does the alignment provide safe overtaking opportunities? 
Does it avoid creating situations where the forward visibility 
is marginal for overtaking (neither clearly adequate nor 
inadequate)?
Does the treatment at curves, proposed if any, make 
appropriate, adequate and safe provision for transition curves, 
super elevation and extra width of carriageway and formation?
Does the vertical alignment pose excessive demands on the 
power of heavy vehicles? Has it been designed so those 
maximum grades are interspersed with recovery grades?
3. 	
Visibility and Sight Distance
Are sight and stopping distances adequate throughout the 
proposal?
Is the design free of sight restrictions (maybe due to buildings, 
trees, signs, or rock slopes)?
Does the design and proposal within an encumbrance free 
ROW allow adequate visibility for an approaching driver to see 
a pedestrian waiting to cross the road?
Does the design and proposal within an encumbrance free 
ROW allow adequate visibility funnel for an approaching driver 
to see a vehicle waiting to cross the carriageway from side 
road or storage lane of median?
4. 
Staged Works
If the scheme is to be constructed in stages, are the stages 
arranged to ensure maximum safety?
If the scheme is a stage towards a wider or dual carriageway, is 
the design adequate to clearly impart this message to drivers? 
(Always look for misleading things that could confuse drivers/
riders)

Cross Section
Are the widths of the carriageway, shoulders, medians (if any), 
service roads in accordance with standards and adequate for 
the function of the road and volume and the mix of traffic likely 
to use it?
Check whether bridges have footpaths and they have proper 
gradients/crash barriers/parapets.
a)	Existing Bridges
b)	New proposed Bridges
c)	Approaches of proposed VUP/PUPs
Note any location where the cross-section standard changes 
abruptly along the route or is otherwise inconsistent with driver 
expectations.
Have the shoulders and side slopes been designed to a safe 
standard and note any locations with inadequate shoulder 
width?
Have the side drains been designed to a safe standard? 
Are the batter slopes and drains safe for run-off vehicles to 
traverse?
Check whether the cross-section has adequate provision for 
the Vulnerable Road Users including persons with disabilities:
(a)	
Pedestrians: Have paved footpath, adequate refuge 
width on median and proper ramps, up and down kerbs, 
where there is regular pedestrian traffic?
(b)	
Bicyclists: Segregated areas (e.g. paved shoulders) 
where numbers are significant.
In particular, is the cross section wide enough to provide 
sheltered turn lanes within the median (in case of divided 
carriageway)? Is it possible to provide storage lane for small 
vehicles that really need protection without being exposed to 
through traffic.

and other narrowing’s? (NOTE: It is desirable for safety 
to continue full width shoulders across bridges and other 
narrowings).
Are overtaking and/or climbing lanes proposed if needed?
Are all roadside hazards (existing and proposed) being 
managed “safely”? (NOTE: Check if a clear zone has been 
used during the development of the proposal and assess if 
that clear zone will be adequate).
