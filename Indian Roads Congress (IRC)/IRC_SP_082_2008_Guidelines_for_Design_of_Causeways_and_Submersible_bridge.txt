GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN OF CAUSEWAYS AND
SUBMERSIBLE BRIDGES
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The Guidelines for Design ofCauseways and Submersible Bridges had been under
the consideration ofthe earlier General Design Features Committee since the year 2004. Later on
this Committee was merged with the General Design Features (Bridges and Grade Separated
Structures Committee (B-l) at the time of reconstitution in January, 2006. The General Design
Features Committee in its meeting held on 15
th May, 2004 had constituted a Sub-group consisting
of Shri P.L. Bongirwar, Dr. C.V. Kand, S/Shri D.K. Rastogi, M.V.B. Rao and Late Shri N.K.
Patel. Thereafter, the draft as prepared by the Sub-group and Shri S.K. Kaiastha was considered
by the reconstituted General Design Features (Bridges and Grade Separated Structures Committee,
B-l) in a number of meetings and finalized it in its meeting held on 12
th October, 2006 subject to
incorporation Of certain comments by its Convenor, Shri Prafulla Kumar.
The personnel of B-l Committee is given below:

Thereafter, the draft guidelines for Design of Causeways and Submersible Bridges
were considered by the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS) in its meeting held
on 3
rd November, 2007. The Committee formed a Sub-group comprising Shri Chaman Lai, CE(B)
S&R, MOSRT&H, Shri M.V.B.Rao, Dr. C.V. Kand and Shri Sharad Varshney, Addl. Director
(Technical), IRC for technical enhancement ofthe document. The Sub-group met thrice on 9. 1 .2008,
I
.2.2008 and 23.5.2008 and put up the draft document again to Bridges Specifications & Standards
Committee.
1.3.
The valuable suggestions offered by the members of General Design Features
(Bridges and Grade Separated Structures) Committee (B-l) and Bridges Specifications & Standards
Committee are duly incorporated.
1.4.
The draft document was approved by the Bridges Specifications and Standards
Committee in its meeting held on 29.3.2008, and the Executive Committee in its meeting held on
I I
.4.2008 and authorized Secretary General, IRC to place the same before Council. The document
was approved by the IRC Council in its
1 85
th meeting held on 1 1 .4.2008, at Aizwal (Mizoram) for
printing subject to incorporation of some comments offered by the Council members.

IRC:SP:82-2008
3. GENERAL FEATURES
3.1.
Definitions
The following definitions shall be applicable for the purpose ofthese Guidelines.
3.1.1.
Bridge
Bridge is a structure having a total length of above 6 m between the inner faces of the dirt
walls
for
carrying
traffic or other moving loads over a depression or obstruction such as
channel, road or railway. These are classified as minor and major bridges as per classification
given below:
(a)
Minor Bridge
: A minor bridge is a bridge having a total length of upto 60 m.
A minor bridge upto a total length of30 m is sometimes classified
as a small bridge.
(b)
Major Bridge
: A major bridge is a bridge having a total length of above 60 m.
3.1.2.
High level bridge
A high level bridge is a bridge which carries the roadway above the highest flood level of
the channel.
3.1.3.
Submersible bridge
A submersible bridge is a bridge designed to be overtopped during floods.
3.1.4. Causeway
A causeway is a paved submersible structure with or without openings (vents) which allows
flood to pass through and/or over it.
3.1.5.
Ford
A ford is an unpaved shallow portion in a river or stream bed which can be used as a
crossing during dry weather/normal flow.
3.1.6.
Culvert
A culvert is a cross-drainage structure having a total length of 6 m or less between the inner
faces of the dirt walls or extreme ventway boundaries measured at right angles there to.
3.1.7.
Channel
A channel means a natural or artificial watercourse.
3.1.8.
Afflux
It is the rise in the flood level of the channel immediately on the upstream of a bridge as a
result of obstruction to natural flow caused by the construction of the bridge and its approaches.

PAGE 15 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
3.1.9.
Highest Flood Level (HFL)
Highest flood level is the level ofthe highest flood ever recorded or the calculated level for
the design discharge, whichever is higher.
3.1.10. Ordinary Flood level (OFL)
Ordinary flood level is the level of flood expected to occur every year. It can be determined
by averaging the highest flood levels of seven consecutive years.
3.1.11. Low Water Level (LWL)
Low water level is the level ofthe water surface attained generally in the dry season. It can
also be determined by averaging the low water levels recorded in seven consecutive years.
3.1.12.
Design Flood Level (DFL)
It is the highest flood level for which the structure must be designed. It corresponds to level
of highest flood of 50 years or
1 00 years return period (whichever is chosen for design) or the
highest known flood level if the same happens to be higher.
3.1.13.
Defined Cross-section
It is the undisturbed natural cross-section ofriver which does not exhibit signs oferosion or
silting ofbed.
3.1.14.
Protected Bed Level (PBL)
It is the level at which the bed surface is protected against erosion due to flow of water.
3.2.
Types of Submersible Structures
3.2.1.
Fords
Fords are unpaved structures and are suitable only for roads having very low volume of
traffic. These are the simplest form of crossings where the stream is wide and shallow, velocity of
flowing water is low and bed surface is relatively firm.
In case the bed surface is not firm enough and not capable of carrying the vehicular traffic,
the bed can be strengthened and made more even with buried stones just below the bed surface. If
the stones are likely to be carried away in flow, this is prevented by construction of barriers made
of suitable size of boulders or wooden piles. Boulders ( neither too large which may result in
scouring ofbed nor too small likely to be carried away by flow) are placed across the river bed at
downstream side ofthe ford to filter the flow ofwater and retain small size particles ofbed material
like sand, gravels etc. resulting in a more even surface for vehicular traffic. Fig. 3.1 shows a typical
cross-section of such type of ford.

IRC:SP:82-2008
3.2.2. Causeways
There are mainly three types of causeways:
(a)
Flush causeway
In this type of causeway which is also called paved dip or road dam, the top level of
road is kept same as that of bed level of the channel.
It is suitable where the crossing
remains dry for most of part of year i.e. the stream is not perennial. Flush causeways
are not suitable for crossing the streams with steep bed slopes causing high velocity
even in low floods. The causeway covers the full width of the channel Fig. 3.2.
Fig. 3.2. Typical Features of Paved dip/Flush Causeway
(b)
Vented causeway
A causeway provided with vents to permit normal flow of the stream to pass under
the causeway is known as vented causeway. Vented causeways are classified as low
vented causeways and high vented causeways.
(i)
Low vented causeway
Low vented causeways are provided to cross quasi-perennial streams having sandy
beds in areas with annual rainfall less than
1 000 mm and where the carriageway of a
/

======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
flush causeway would be liable to get slushy due to post monsoon flow in the stream.
The height is generally less than 1 .20 m above the bed ofthe watercourse. In exceptional
cases, the height may be
1 .50 m above the bed level. Small size of vents in the form
ofhume pipes, short span slabs/R.C.C. Box cells are provided in the width of stream.
The sill level ofvents is kept about
1 50 mm - 300 mm below the average bed level of
the stream.
(ii)
High vented causeway
High vented causeway is provided when a road crosses a stream having one or more
ofthe following characteristics:
(i)
Sizeable catchment area with annual rainfall more than
1 000 mm
(ii)
Depth of post monsoon flow is more than 900 mm
(iii)
Flow is perennial but not large
(iv)
Banks are low necessitating construction of high embankment in the stream bed
from considerations of the free board in non-submersible portion as well as
geometric standards of approach roads
The height of the causeway above the bed is generally kept between
1 .5 m to 3.0 m and
larger size of vents comprising of hume pipes or simply supported/continuous R.C.C. slab
superstructure over a series of short masonry piers or series of arches or boxes with individual
spans less than 3 m are provided.
3.2.3.
Submersible bridge
Submersible bridge is normally sub-classified as high submersible bridge or low submersible
bridge depending upon deck level with reference to OFL.
The deck level of high submersible bridge is fixed with reference to OFL and vertical
clearance, and as such the structure serves as high level bridge during OFL but gets submerged
under higher floods with permissible number and duration of interruptions. This type of bridge is
suitable for streams having large variation between HFL and OFL.
The deck level of low submersible bridge is fixed above the OFL so as to ensure that the
interruptions caused to traffic remain within permissible limits.
3.3.
Selection of Type of Submersible Bridge/Causeway
3.3.1.
General
The type of structure (i.e. high level or submersible) across a watercourse (channel) has to
be judiciously selected on the basis of reconnaissance inspection report and available data. The
choice mainly depends on the classification ofthe project road, requirements ofthe user authority,
hydrology of the watercourse and availability of funds for the project.

======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
3.3.2.
Considerations in the selection of type of submersible structures
Selection of type of submersible structures (i.e. ford or causeway or submersible bridge)
inter-alia depends on:
-(a)
Requirements ofuser authority and availability of funds
(b)
Category, importance of road and traffic intensity
(c)
Population to be served
(d)
Nature of stream i.e. flashy/perennial/seasonal etc. and velocity ofwater during floods
(e)
Duration, magnitude of floods and interruption to traffic
(f)
Spread and depth of water during floods and post monsoon period
(g)
Extent ofcatchment area
3.3.3.
Criteria for avoiding/selection of submersible structures
In the absence ofany directives/guidelines by the user authority, the following criteria may
be followed for selection of suitable type of submersible structures including causeways on different
categories of roads.
( 1 )
These should be avoided on National Highways
(2)
These may not be considered for adoption in the following situations:
(i)
Roads ofeconomic importance, roads linking important towns or industrial areas
or areas with population more than 10,000 where alternative all weather route
with reasonable length of detour is not available
(ii)
On roads which are likely to be upgraded or included, from future traffic
considerations, in the National Highway network
(iii)
If the length of a high level bridge at such crossings would be less than 30 m
except where construction ofhigh level structure is not economically viable
(iv) Maximum mean velocity of stream during floods is more than 6 m/sec
(v)
If the cost of submersible bridge with its approaches is estimated to be more
than approximately 70% of the cost of high level bridge with its approaches,
near about the same site
(vi)
If firm banks are available and approaches are in cutting or height ofembankment
for submersible portion of approaches is more than 2 m
(vii) Where there are faults in the river bed
(viii) If after completion ofthe submersible structures, the number of interruptions in
a year caused to traffic and duration ofthe interruptions are likely to exceed the
suggested values given in Table 3.1 below.

(b)
The geometric standards in general should conform to relevant IRC Publications
(i.e. IRC:5, IRC:38, IRC:52, IRC:73, IRC:86, IRC:SP:20, IRC:SP:23 and
IRC:SP:48).
(c)
There is no specific separate guideline in the IRC codes regarding geometric design
standards for submersible structures including immediate approaches except in
IRC:5, which stipulates that vented causeways/submersible bridges shall provide for
at least two lanes of traffic (7.5 m wide carriageway) unless one lane of traffic
(4.25 m wide carriageway) is specially permitted in the design. However, the provision
for single lane width is likely to be revised and has been increased in these guidelines.

Cross-drainage structures are difficult to widen at a later date. As such, road width should
be selected carefully at the planning stage itself. In case a road is likely to be upgraded in the
foreseeable future, it is desirable to adopt higher roadway width.
Minimum carriageway width of submersible structures, measured at right angles to the
longitudinal center line ofthe structure, between the inner faces ofdiscontinuous kerbs/safety kerbs
wherever provided or between the guideposts/stones (without kerbs), should be as given in
Table 3.2.

Note: * Minimum width of carriageway should be suitably increased as per IRC:73
in case of structures
located on curves.
In case footpaths are provided, the width of footpaths should not be less than 1.5 m each.
The widthof discontinuous safety kerbs, ifprovided should not be^ less than 600 mm.
Overall width between the outer faces of discontinuous kerbs/safety kerbs wherever
provided or guideposts/stones/railings (without kerbs) of the structures with length upto 30 m
should preferably be a little more to match with the roadway width of immediate approaches
Table 3.3.
3.4.3.
Geometries of approach roads
(i)
Alignment ofthe road generally governs the site ofa submersible structure ifthe length
of crossing is less than 60 m. However, if the length ofthe crossing is more than 60 m,

======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
the suitability of the site for the submersible structure and the geometric design of
immediate approaches both should be considered together. In case the length of
crossing is more than 300 m, the most suitable site for the bridge should be the governing
criteria.
(ii)
The approaches on either side of a straight submersible bridge should have a minimum
straight length of 30 m and should be suitably increased, where necessary, to provide
for the minimum sight distance for a vehicular speed of 35 km/h.
(iii)
Horizontal curves in immediate approach roads for a length of about
1 00 m on either
side of a submersible structure or causeways should be avoided. If horizontal curves
have to be provided in the approaches, the same should be located beyond the straight
portion on either side and the minimum radius of curvature, the super-elevation and
transition length Should be provided in accordance with relevant stipulations contained
in IRC:38. Radii of horizontal curves in case of immediate approach roads however
should, not be less than 60 m in case of plain and rolling terrain and 30 m in case of
hilly terrain from road user safety consideration.
3.4.4.
Design speed
From consideration of safety of road users, lower design speed than that recommended in
IRC: 73 should be adopted for the immediate approaches to a submersible bridge or causeway.
The informatory boards installed on approaches should indicate permissible speed of 35 km/h in
case ofplain and rolling terrain and 20 km/h in case ofmountainous and steep terrain irrespective
of any higher speed adopted in the design of the road.
3.4.5. Roadway width

* For single lane State Highways, width of roadway might be reduced to 9 m
if the possibility of
widening, the carriageway to two lanes
is considered remote.
2.
** The roadway widths
in mountainous and steep terrain, given above are exclusive of parapets
(usual width 0.6 m) and side drains (usual width 0.6 m).
3. *** Roadway width for rural roads in plain and rollers terrain also may be reduced to 6.0 m in case
where traffic intensity
is less than 100 motor vehicles per day and traffic
is not likely to increase
due to situations like dead end, low habitation and difficult terrain conditions.

m On roads subject to heavy snow fall, where regular snow clearance
is done over long periods to
keep the road open to traffic, the roadway width may be increased by
1 .5 m.

The roadway widths for Rural Roads are on the basis of a single lane carriageway of 3.75 m.
6
In hard rock stretches, or unstable locations where excessive cutting might lead to slope failure,
width of roadway may be reduced by 0.8 m on two-lane roads and 0.4 m in other cases.

On horizontal curves, the roadway width should be increased corresponding to the extra widening
of carriageway for curvature.

Camber/crossfall
The camber/crossfall on straight sections of immediate approaches and on submersible
structures should be unidirectional towards the downstream and as recommended in Table 3.4

Gradients
As a general rule, values ofruling gradients specified in IRC: 73 should be adopted. However,
in case of immediate approaches to submersible structures, carrying substantial slow traffic, flatter

4. HYDROLOGY AND HYDRAULICS
4.1.
Hydrology
4.1.1.
General
For the design of an efficient and economical hydraulic structure, knowledge ofhydrology
and the characteristics of the Stream/River are ofparamount importance. A brief about hydrology
is given in Appendix 4.1
. In most cases hydrological record ofthe stream particularly data regarding
floods may not be available. A rational estimation of design flood discharge for the specified return
period leads to economical design of bridge foundations for submersible bridges. The failures of
hydraulic structures are very expensive as in most cases, the indirect costs are many times larger
than the direct cost ofbridge replacement. Some hydraulic structures especially bridges have failed
in the past mainly due to inadequate assessment ofHFL/ Design flood discharge and rarely due to
structural failures. Due attention to the determination of hydrology of the structure needs to be
paid as an irrational approach can lead to loss and destruction of the structure due to floods higher
than the design floods.
4.1.2.
Determination of design discharge
The design discharge for which the waterway of most of the bridge including submersible
bridges is to be designed should be based on the flood discharge corresponding to highest observed
flood level, irrespective of the return period of that flood or the flood of 50 years' return period
whichever is higher, except in the case of important bridges when return period may be taken as
100 years. The design discharge can be determined by the following methods:
( 1 )
Empirical Methods
(2)
Slope Area Method
(3)
Rational Method
(4)
Unit Hydrograph Method
4.1.2.1. Empirical methods
Based on studies conducted, some empirical formulae for specific regions have been
evolved. The empirical formulae for flood discharge suggested are in the form:
•
Q - CA"
...
(4.1)
Where,
Q
=
Max. flood discharge in m
3/s
A
=
Catchment Area in sq. km
C
=
An Empirical Constant, depending upon nature and location of catchment
n
=
A Constant
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
The most commonly adopted empirical formulae and recommended for use are:
(i)
Dicken's formula based on data of rivers in Central India, (ii) Ryve's formula based
on Rivers in South India and (iii) Inglis formula based on West Indian rivers in the old
Bombay Province. Details of these emperical formulae are given in Appendix 4.2.
The empirical formule should, however, be used with due caution as given below:
(i)
These were developed for particular region and for small catchments and, therefore,
have obvious limitations. The value of 'C at the best is valid only for the region for
which it has been determined, as each basin has its own characteristics affecting run-
off.
(ii)
These involve only one known variable factor viz. area of the catchment and therefore
a large number of remaining factors that affect the run-off such as shape, slope,
permeability of catchments etc. are to be accounted for in selecting an appropriate
value ofthe coefficient 'C.
(iii) A correct value of 'C ' can only be derived for a given region from an extensive analytical
study of the measured flood discharge vis-a-vis characteristics ofthe basin. The value
of 'C will therefore be valid only for the region for which it has been determined, as
each basin has its own characteristics affecting run-off. Anew designer should use
these formulae only under the guidance of an experienced designer or expert.
4.1.2.2. Slope - area method
In this method the maximum water level reached in a historic flood is estimated on the
evidence of local witnesses, which may include identification of flood marks on structures or trees
close to the bridge site. The discharge is then calculated by:
Q=AV
Where, Q = discharge in m
3/s and A = wetted area in m
2
V = velocity of flow in m/sec which can be calculated by the Manning's formula
V=l/nR
2/\ S m
Where, R = hydraulic mean depth, S - the energy slope which may be taken as equal to
bed slope and n = rugosity coefficient.
The details ofthe method are given in Appendix 4.3.
This method has also considerable room for error due to:
(i)
The variability of bed profile slope etc. during floods from those measured during
survey.

IRC:SP:82-2008
(ii)
The computation of stream velocity is dependent upon a subjective selection of an
Empirical Coefficient of rugosity for different conditions of bed out of the various
values recommended by Manning.
4.1.2.3. Rational method
The rational method for flood discharge takes into account the intensity, distribution and
duration of rainfall as well as the characteristics of the catchment area, such as shape, slope,
permeability and initial wetness ofthe catchment.
The rational formula is as follows:
Q
= A I 0 X

catchment etc. The details about Rational Method are given in Appendix 4.4. The formulae may
generally be adopted for catchment areas upto 500 sq. km and upto 2000 sq. km in exceptional
cases.
4.1.2.4. Unit hydrograph method
(i)
Unit Hydrograph: The unit hydrograph or unit graph is defined as the hydrograph of
storm run-off at a given point in the river, resulting from an isolated rainfall of unit
duration (normally taken as 6 h to 1 2 h) occurring uniformly over the catchment and
producing unit run-off. The unit run-off adopted is
1 cm depth over the catchment
area.
(ii)
A Committee of Engineers appointed by Govt, of India recommended a rational
methodology based on use ofdesign storms and unit hydrographs for estimating design
floods for different zones/sub-zones of India. A list of these zones and sub-zones is
given in 'Annexure A' of Appendix 4.5. The report as prepared jointly by CWC,
RDSO (Railways), MoSRT&H and IMD have been published by CWC, Govt, of
India. These reports give methodology through a set of charts and graphs for quick
estimation of design flood of 25, 50 or 100 years of return periods for ungauged
catchments.

======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
(iii)
Unit hydrographs are prepared either by computation from direct run-offhydrograph
for gauged streams or are synthetically prepared from catchment characteristics for
ungauged catchments and then used for finding design flood of desired return period.
The detailed procedure for constructing Synthetic unit hydrograph and how to obtain
design flood from storm of corresponding return period is illustrated in an example
given in Appendix 4.5.
(iv)
The unit hydrograph method can give fairly precise results for drainage areas upto
5000 sq. km. Variation in assumptions made for larger areas (>5000 sq. km) in the
method are usually too great to be ignored.
4.1.2.5. Fixing design discharge
Flood discharge can be estimated by three or more different methods and the values
obtained should be compared. The highest ofthese values should be adopted as the design discharge
provided it does not exceed the next highest discharge by more than 50%. If it does, restrict it to
that limit.
4.1.3. Discharge through a submersible bridge
The total discharge in the stream after the construction of a submersible bridge can be
found by the method suggested by Johnson Victor as given below:

In cases where the cross-section of the stream has wide spill zones of shallow
depth, the discharge through causeway or low level submersible bridge can also be found by
adding the calculated discharge of the three parts viz. (a) Discharge through vents of area A 1
,
( b) Flow over the causeway/submersible bridge proper through area A2 and (c) Flow over
shallow triangular compartments of area A3 on either side of the main stream at the crossing.

Forces due to Water
4.2.1. Hydro Static Force
Force of stationary water on a solid surface is called the hydrostatic force. It includes force
due to the afflux head and the force of buoyancy. A body submerged in water experiences an
upward force due to water pressure and this force is called 'Buoyancy'. It must be considered for
stability of structure ifthere is possibility where while considering combination of forces, stability
ofthe structure is to be affected.
It is recommended that while checking for minimum pressure on
foundation, the maximum uplift pressure at high water level should be considered. Further, while
checking for maximum pressure the minimum uplift pressure at the low water level should be taken
into account. In case of submersible bridges, full buoyancy effect on the superstructure also needs
to be considered.
4.2.2. Hydrodynamic force of water current
4.2.2.1. Water current forces on foundation above scour level and on substructure
Water current causes hydrodynamic force on the submerged part of a body. These forces
on a member can be calculated by the following formula as given in Clause 2 1 3 of IRC:6.

4.2.2.2. Water current forces on superstructure
(i)
The importance ofwater current forces on the superstructure is significant due to the
extent of obstruction offered by the bridge superstructure and its location. Since the
submerged area of superstructure exposed to water current forces is sufficiently large
and the velocity of current at its level is also high, the stresses on foundations due to
water current forces acting on the submerged superstructure are quite pronounced.
(ii)
Flowing water produces two types of forces on a submerged or partially submerged
superstructure viz. the drag force and the lift force. These are characterized by two
factors i.e. the drag force co-efficient (C d) and coefficient of lift (CL). Both drag force
and lift force depend largely on the shape of the body and several other factors and
these can be best determined by conducting hydraulic model studies, as explained in
Appendix 4.6.
(iii)
The results of model studies conducted so far do not conclusively recommend any
generalized values of co-efficient of drag (Cd) and co-efficient of lift (CL). However,
presently the following method is adopted for calculation of drag force and uplift
pressure on superstructures, in cases where it is not feasible or economically viable to
conduct hydraulic model studies:
(a)
The expression P = 52 KV
2 as given in para 4.2.2. 1 be adopted with value ofK
as
1 .5 for drag force.
(b)
The expression p = wh may be adopted for calculating uplift pressure,
Where 'w' is the unit weight of water and 'h' is the uplift head under the deck and can be
estimated as h = thickness of slab + wearing coat and afflux after deducting the head loss due to
increase in velocity through vents.
The head loss is given by the expression (V y
2 - V
2)/2g,
Where V v is the velocity through vents and V is velocity of approach.

Appendix 4.1
A BRIEF ON HYDROLOGY
Hydrology deals with depletion and replacement of our water resources.
The basic
knowledge ofthis science is must for Civil Engineer, particularly; the one who is engaged in design
planning and construction ofhydraulic structures such as Bridges."* ^
-
I.
The Hydrologic Cycle: Most ofthe earth's water sources such as rivers, lakes, oceans
and underground sources, etc. get their supply from the rains, while the rain water in
itself is the evaporation from these sources. Water is lost to the atmosphere as vapour
from the earth, which is then precipitated back in the form of rain, snow, hail, dew,
sleet or frost, etc. This evaporation and precipitation continues forever and thereby,
a balance is maintained between the two. This process is known as Hydrologic Cycle.
It can be represented graphically, as shown in Fig. 4.4.
Representing Hydrologic Cycle
Fig. 4.4
II.
Run-off
Run-off and surface run-off are two different items and should not be confused. Run-
off includes all water flowing in the stream at any given section, and therefore it can
also be named as 'Discharge of the Stream' while surface run-off includes only the
water that reaches the stream channel without first percolating down to the water
table. Run-off consists of the following (Fig. 4.5).
(i)
Direct precipitation over the surface of the stream and its distributaries, this is
very small and ignored.
(ii)
Surface run-off consisting oftrue surface run-off and sub-surface run-off.

Tcue S.R.O.
Fig. 4.5
(iii)
Ground water flow.
(iv)
True surface run-off :- Water that flows directly over the ground surface to the
stream.
(v)
Sub-surface run-off:- Water that infiltrate the soil, moves laterally and before
joining water table it joins the river channel and this quantity ofwater is known
as sub-surface run-off. It behaves nearly like a surface run-off and not like a
ground water flow, because it reaches stream so quickly that it is difficult to
differentiate from true surface run-off. For this reason Sub-Surface Run-off is
always treated as surface run-off.
Hence, Run-off= Surface Run-off+ Ground Water flow.
The ground water is often times, long delayed before it reaches the stream.
It is to be
further noted that Ground water flow is important for 'Minimum flow' in the stream while surface
run-off is important for the 'Maximum flow' ofthe stream.
Run-off depends upon (a) Characteristics of drainage basin and (b) Characteristics of
rainfall precipitation which further depends on following factors:
(i)
Characteristics ofDrainage basin depend upon (i) Size,
(ii) Shape (fan or fern),
(iii) Elevation of water shed. Besides these three important characteristics of the
drainage basin, the arrangement of the stream channels formed by nature within the
basin, the type of soil, the type ofvegetation cover are various other factors influencing
the run-off.
(ii)
Characteristics of Rainfall Precipitation depend upon
(i) Slope of Channel,
(ii) Shape in plan (layout) (iii) Nature of bed (iv) Sub-soil storage characteristics of
the bed and banks (v) Status of flow at commencement of precipitation.
III. The Rainfall precipitations are of following types: -
(i)
Cyclonic Precipitation - Cyclonic precipitation is oftwo types: Tropical and
Extra Tropical. The tropical cyclones originate in the open ocean and are primary
source ofmonsoon rainfall in the country. Extra tropical cyclonic precipitation is
responsible for most of the winter rains in North- Western India.
24

IRC:SP:82-2008
(ii)
Convection Precipitation - Convection precipitation generally occurs in tropics
in the form of showers ofhigh intensity and short duration.
(iii)
Orographic Precipitation :- It is most important precipitation and is responsible
for most ofthe rains in India. Orographic precipitation is caused by air masses
which strike some topographic barriers like mountains and can not move forward,
hence rise up causing condensation and precipitation, and greatest amount of
precipitation falls on wind ward side. A striking example of such natural barriers
is in southern slopes of the hills of Meghalaya.
The rainfall is dependent on various factors and combination which are numerous
such as:
(a)
Duration (b) Quantum (c) Intensity (d) Direction of storm (e) Special distribution
of rain over the catchments (f) Temperature and Humidity (g) Velocity and
duration ofwind

Point rainfall, also known as station rainfall refers to the rainfall data of a station.
Depending upon the need, data can be listed as daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal or
annual values for various periods. In practice, however, hydrological analysis requires
a knowledge of the rainfall over an area, such as over a catchment. To convert the
point rainfall values at various stations into an average value over a catchment, the
following three methods are in use:
(a)
Arithmetic-mean method,
(b)
Thiessen-polygon method, and
(c)
Isohyetal method.
(a)
Arithmetic-Mean Method
When the rainfall measured at various stations in a catchment show little variation, the
average precipitation over the catchment area is taken as the arithmetic mean ofthe station values.
Thus if P,, P
2
,
, P
n are the rainfall values in a given period in n stations within a catchment,
then the value ofthe mean precipitation P over the catchment by the arithmetic-mean method is
P =
J
1
=
t
P
n
n
i =
1
This method is explained in Fig. 4.6(a).
(b)
Thiessen-Mean Method
In this method the rainfall recorded at each station is given a weightage on the basis of an
area closest to the station. The procedure of determining the weighting area is as follows: Consider
a catchment area shown in Fig. 4.6 (b) containing eleven raingauge stations, ofwhich five lie
outside the catchment but in its neighbourhood. TJie catchment area is shown and positions ofthe

eleven stations marked on it. Stations
1 to
1 1 (not indicated) are joined to form a network of
triangles. Perpendicular bisectors for each of the sides of the triangle are drawn. These bisectors
form a polygon around each station. The boundary ofthe catchment, if it cuts the bisectors is taken
as the outer limit of the polygon. These bounding polygons are called Thiessen Polygons. The
areas of these eight Thiessen polygons are determined either with a planimeter or by using an

Isohyetal Method
An isohyet is a line joining points of equal rainfall magnitude. In the isohytal method, the
catchment area is drawn to scale and the raingauge stations are marked. The recorded values for
which areal average P is to be determined are then marked on the plot at appropriate stations.
Neighbouring stations outside the catchment are also considered. The isohyets of various values
are then drawn by considering point rainfalls as guides and interpolating between them by the eye
(Fig. 4.6 (c)). The procedure is similar to the drawing of elevation contours based on spot levels.
The area between two adjacent isohyets are then determined with a planimeter. If the
isohyets go out of catchment, the catchment boundary is used as the bounding line. The
average value of the rainfall indicated by two isohyets is assumed to be acting over the
inter-isohyet area. ThusP,,P

Snowfall/Snow Melt
In India snowmelt is of importance in Himalayan region. Snowmelt run-off adds to
the flood by augmenting the rainfall run-off. Two situations are usuallyi^onsiderej^
(i)
A short period accumulation of an optimum snow cover in a fairly wet drainage
basin, followed by a rainfall of a maximum probable magnitude for the season.
(ii) A maximum snow accumulation and melting under a critical temperature sequence,
along with a rainstorm at the time ofmaximum snowmelt run-off. Methods of
estimation ofmaximum probable snowmelt flood are being developed. Some
methods, which are in general use, are described in a manual published by U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation.

Appendix 4.3
DISCHARGE BY SLOPE-AREA METHOD
This method is applicable where reliable data regarding the highest level ofdischarge at or
close to the site is available but not regarding velocity. It is generally easy to obtain highest level of
discharge data by local enquiries from the oldest inhabitants in the area or by observing old flood
marks on the trees and buildings near the project site. The determination of flood discharge can
then be done by applying formulae for determining discharge in open channels. Site data to be
collected for this purpose are:-
1
.
Cross-Section ofthe river at the site of the probable scoured bed line
2 .
Observation ofthe nature ofriver
3 .
Slope ofthe surface ofthe water in the stream noted by observations during floods or
from flood marks
For this purpose three cross-section ofthe river should be taken one at the proposed site
of the crossing, one upstream and one downstream, distances being as given in Table 4.2 below.

When the cross-section is not plotted to the natural scale (the same scale horizontally and
vertically), the wetted perimeter (P) cannot be scaled directly from the section and has to be
calculated. Divide up the wetted line into a convenient number of parts AB, BC and CD, etc. as
shown in Fig. 4.7.
Consider one such part say PQ, let PR or QR be its horizontal and vertical projections.
The PQ= (PR2 + QR2
). Now PR can be measured on the horizontal scale of the given

'A.' is a function ofthe size, shape and roughness ofthe stream and is called its conveyance
factor. Thus the discharge conveying capacity of a stream depends on its conveyance factor and
slope.
If the shape of the cross-section is irregular as happens when a stream rises its banks and
shallow overflows are created, it is necessary to sub-divide the channel into two or three subsections.
Then 'R' and 'rj ' are found for each sub-section, and their velocities and discharges are computed
separately and then added together to get the total discharge.

DISCHARGE BY RATIONAL METHOD
A rational method for estimation of flood discharge should take into account the intensity,
distribution and duration of rainfall as well as characteristics ofthe catchment area. It should also
take into account the discharge characteristics ofthe catchment area which depend on its shape,
slope, permeability and initial wetness ofthe catchment.
1 .
Govardhanlal, in his method, applied the following Rational formula where by knowing the
highest observed rain fall at a representative gauging station in an hour and knowing
characteristics of the catchment area and rainfall, one find the discharge safely for areas
upto 500 sq. km.

Estimation of time of Concentration (t.)
It is the time taken by the run-offfrom the farthest point on the periphery ofthe Catchment
(called the critical point) to reach site of Bridge. The concentration time depends on (i) the
distance from the critical point upto the Bridge site and (2) the average velocity of flow
which depends upon the slope, the roughness of drainage channel and depth of flood.
Complicated formulae exists for determining the time of concentration
(t

characteristics ofthe catchment.

The value ofA,L, and H can be obtained from Survey ofIndia Topographical maps. I has
to be obtained from Meteorology Department. I0 of region have not to be found for each design
problem, it is characteristic of the whole region and applies to pretty vast areas having the same
weather conditions. I 0 of a region should be found once for all and should be known to local
engineers. The Metrological Department, Govt, ofIndia have data for heaviest rainfall in centimeter/
hour collected for various places in India and are to be obtained from them.
Rational Method may be applied safely for areas upto 500 sq. km and upto 2000 sq. km in
extreme cases. The use of Rational Method for small catchments have been advised in IRC:SP:13
vide clause 4.7.14 stating that since the average designer cannot rely so much on his judgement
and intuition for selecting value of 'C in Empirical formulae he should adopt 'Rational Method'
which has been outlined in detail in IRC:SP:13, Para 4.7.

PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATION OF DESIGN FLOOD BY

A typical example with reference to Bridge catchment (treated as ungauged) is worked out
for illustrating the procedure to compute 50-year design flood and is given below:
The particulars ofthe catchment under study are as under:

The procedure comprises of assessingA (area), L (Length of longest channel), S (Equivalent
Slope of channel) and then finding out Synthetic unit hydrograph ordinates by using these values
and relationship derived by research study for the sub-zone concerned. Estimation of effective
rainfall unit is done using 50 year 24 hour point rain fall values given in the report for design storm
duration, calculated earlier considering design loss rate. With unit hydrograph &
1 hour effective
rainfall, 50 year flood is estimated considering design base flow.
The procedure is explained stepwise as follows:
Step I: Preparation of Catchment Area Plan
The point of interest (i.e. bridge site in this case) was located on the Survey of India
toposheet and catchment boundary was marked using the contours along the ridge line and
also from the spot levels in the plains. A catchment area plan (Plate 1) showing the rivers,
contours and spot levels was prepared.
Step: 2: Determination of Physiographic Parameters
The following physiographic parameters were determined from the catchment area plan
i.e. Plate 1.

By Graphical Method
Draw a longitudinal section ofthe longest main stream from contours crossing the stream
and the spot levels along the banks from the source to the point ofstudy from the catchment

study such that the area above and below the L-Section line are equal. Then compute the

Step 4: Drawing of a Synthetic Unit Hydrograph
Estimated parameters of unit hydrograph in Step 3 were plotted to scale on a graph paper
as shown in Plate 2. The potted points were joined to draw a synthetic hydrograph. The
discharge indicated by unit hydrograph is calculated graphically by
£ Q t t f This discharge
is compared with theoretical discharge given by formula Q
= Ad/0.36 x t. The above two
values of discharge i.e. obtained by graphical and theoretical method are compared.
In
case graphical value is different from theoretical, the limb of synthetic unit hydrograph is
adjusted to make it equal to theoretical value. The discharge ordinates (Q .) ofthe unitgraph
at t=t=l hr interval were summed up and multiplied by t^ 1 i.e.E Q t t
( = 378.8 cumecs as
shown in Plate 2. The theoretical volume of 1 .00 cm direct run-offdepth over the catchment
was computed from the formula.
Q,
=
Axd/0.36xt = 136.36 x l/0.36x

Where,
A
=
catchment area in sq km
d
-
1.0 cm depth
t
=
t
r (the unit duration of the UG) =
1 .00 h
Therefore, the sum of 1 hr U.G. = 378.8 cumecs. The sum of hourly ordinates (E Q ( x 1
1)
of 1 h U.G. was compared with the sum of 1 h U.G. obtained from the above formula.
In case the SQ
t t
t for the unit hydrograph drawn is higher or lower than the volume
worked out by the above formula, then the falling limb and/or rising limb may be suitably
modified to get the correct volume under the hydrograph, taking care to get the smooth
shape of the unit hydrograph.
Step 5: Estimation of Design Storm Duration
The design storm duration (T
p
) = Tb =
1 6.00 h
Step 6: Estimation of Point Rainfall and Areal rainfall for storm duration
The site under study was located on Plate 3 of this Annexure showing 50-year 24-h point
rainfall. 50 year 24-h point rainfall=32.0 cm. Conversion factor of 0.905 was read from

Step 7: Time Distribution of Areal Raifnall
50-year 16-h areal rainfall = 26.50 cm was distributed with the distribution coefficients
(Col. 1 6 of Table 4.6) to get 1 h rainfall increments as follows:
The hourly rainfall increments in col. (4) ofthe above table were obtained by subtracting
the successive rainfall values from 1 h onwards.
Step 8: Estimation of Effective Rainfall Units
Design loss rate of 0.45 cm/h has been adopted for this sub-zone
Table 4.7 the computation of 1 h effective rainfall units in Col. (4) by subtracting the design
loss rate in Col. (3) from 1-h rainfall increments in Col. (2).
The Column (2) in Table 4.8 is taken from col. (4) of Table 4.7

Step-9: Estimation of Base Flow
The design base flow for this sub-zone is recommended to be computed by the following
formulae:
qb = 0.109/A0126
qb = 0.109/(136.36)° 126 = 0.059 cumecs/sq.km
Total Base Flow = 136.36 x 0.059 = 8.04 cumecs
Step 10: Estimation of 50-Year Flood (Peak Only)
For the estimation ofthe peak discharge the effective rainfall units were re-arranged against
the unitgraph ordinates such that the maximum effective rainfall was placed against the
maximum U.G. ordinate, (obtained from the UG diagram plotted after Step 4), the next
lower value ofrainfall effective against the next lower value ofU.G. ordinate and so on as
shown in Cols. (2) and (3) and summation ofthe product ofU.G. ordinate and rainfall gives
the total direct run-off as in Table 4.9 below:

Unit Hydrograph Method can not be applied safely to large catchments more than 5000
sq.km. and therefore for large Bridge projects one should go in for detailed analysis
supported by Project specific Hydro-meteorological investigations. The total drainage area
has to be divided into a number of sub basins. Separate hydrographs may be derived for
each sub basin from analysis of different storms by using routine method. Calibration of
flood hydrographs and flood routine parameters is essential. For large catchments, flood
frequency analysis is preferred method.

Appendix 4.6
A NOTE ON MODEL STUDIES FOR DETERMINING DRAG AND LIFT FORCES
1
.
Both drag force and lift force depend largely on shape of a body and several other factors
and as such analytical calculations for these forces cannot be done accurately, therefore
recourse to hydraulic models studies is generally taken to determine magnitude of drag and
lift coefficient in the case of important structures.
2.
Model studies began to be used for the study of water flow phenomenon in the later part of
nineteenth century and today model-studies are accepted as useful for Engineering practice.
Model studies cost an insignificant fraction ofthe expenditure ofa project, but these suggest
vital improvement in design as these studies enable the designers to visualize the whole
problem, eliminating doubts and indecisions due to close conformity between the model
and the prototype. Therefore recourse to model studies is generally taken to determine the
magnitudes of coefficient of lift (C L) and coefficient of drag (C d) for evaluation of these
forces on superstructures of important submersible bridges.
3.
Model Studies carried out for Bridges in the former Central Province
3.1.
Several submersible bridges situated in former Central Province (CP) were damaged during
floods of 1938-39 and the deck slabs were carried away bodily, Govt, of CP got model
studies done at Central Water and Power Research Station, Khadakvasla,(CWPRS), Pune.
Annual reports of 1 938-39,
1 939-40 and
1 94 1 -42 of CWPRS, inter-alia deal with the
coefficient ofdrag on submerged bodies particularly with reference to bridge superstructure.
The results arrived at by the Research Station are summarized below.
(a)
Drag Force:
-
The drag on a body kept in steady flow is expressed as
F
d = C d A*pV
2
...
(4.8)
Where,
C
d
=
co-efficient of drag
A
=
characteristic projected area of the body
p
= Mass density of fluid
V
= Undisturbed free stream velocity
The value of C d is dependent on shape of body, roughness of the surface and Reynolds
number (R
g ) which is expressed as VD/u or p VD/fi where V=Velocity, D=Representive
dimension ofbody,
\x = Dynamic viscosity of fluid, u=Kinematic viscosity of fluid, p =Mass
density of fluid.
The drag force mentioned above takes into account 'Skin-Friction-Drag' and 'Form-Drag'.

IRC:SP:82-2008
Skin-Friction-Drag: It depends upon viscosity of the fluid and it forms only a small part of
the total drag force ( 1 0 to 1 5%)
Form-Drag: It is independent ofviscosity and depends largely on shape ofthe body immersed
in fluid and therefore form drag can be found accurately in geometrically similar models
with similar Fraud's number
The ratio of Inertia force (F,) and Gravity force (F
r) is Fraud's number i.e.

of dynamic force to weight. It has greater significance while carrying out model studies for
free surface or open channel flow. The nature of free surface flow (i.e. rapid or tranquil)
depends upon whether Fraud's number is greater or less than unity.
Lift-Force - Lift force is the fluid force component on immersed body acting vertically at
right angle to the approach velocity. The lift force largely depends upon the shape of the
body and comprises hydrostatic force and hydrodynamic force. The hydrostatic force is
generally referred as Buoyancy and acts vertically upwards. This force is independent of
the shape ofthe body. When a body is immerged in a flowing fluid the body experiences in
addition to hydrostatic force, a force due to 'Kinematic energy' of flow and is termed as
Hydrodynamic Uplift force. This force depends on velocity of flow, Reynold's Number
and shape ofbody. This lift force on a body can be expressed in form offollowing equation:

VD
This non-dimensional ratio
is called Reynold's Number (R
e or N
) and it is the ratio of
dynamic force to viscous force. A critical value ofReynold's Number makes distinction between
Laminar and Turbulent flow. Studies have shown that both drag and lift force are highly sensitive to
Reynold's Number, particularly in lower range of Reynold's Number.
Its value beyond
1 .0 X 1
0
6 gives steady value of C,.
Notes:
( 1
)
If 'Frictional or Viscous force' governs the motion, then Reynold's Number will be
applicable.
(2)
If 'Gravity' is the only force producing the motion then 'Froud's Number' will be
applicable.
3.2
The above results give value of coefficient of drag on various shapes of solid slabs having
aspect ratio (width/depth) in range of 12 to 15 and, therefore, are not applicable for box
section having aspect ratio usually in range of 5 to 5.33.
Further, the CWPRS station,
Pune in
1 940 did not estimate the lift force on such shapes and values for the same even for
rectangular shapes are not available.
4.
In the absence of information on coefficient of drag and
lift forces for box-type
superstructures for submersible bridges, model studies were got done to study the effect of
water current forces on the following for submersible bridges.
(i)
Submersible Bridge on 'Chambal River' on NH-3 near Dholpur (Rajasthan)
(ii)
Submersible Bridge on 'Bhima River at Sangam Village on Tembhurni-Akluj Road-
Distt. Solapur (Maharashtra)
During these model studies it was decided to observe value of coefficient of drag (C d)
coefficient of lift (C^ on box-girder superstructure for various depths of submergence
and various velocities of water current.
4.1
Submersible Bridge at Chambal River — on (NH-3) Near Dholpur (Rajasthan)
(a)
In absence of value of 'k' for box-type deck submersible bridge in the IRC codes, Rajasthan
P.W.D. and Ministry of Shipping Road Transport & Highways (MoSRT&H) took decision
that model studies be got done at Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, for the box
section adopted for superstructure for the reconstruction ofdamaged submersible bridge
at Chambal (NH-3), so that values of coefficient of drag (C d) and coefficient of lift (C,) are
evaluated and accordingly precautions are taken in design and construction for drag and lift
forces. At present, IRC Codes does not provide any value for C d and C, for Aerofoil box
Section.
The shape and dimensions of the Aerofoil box superstructure adopted at Chambal bridge
are given below in Fig. 4.10.

The brieftechnical details for the Chambal submersible bridge are as follows:
(i)
Maximum design discharge = 5097.6 cumec
(ii)
Maximum design velocity of flow = 4.57 m/sec
(iii)
Maximum depth of flow = 27. 1 3 m
(iv)
Deck level is at 8.23 m below the maximum design flood level
(v)
Length of individual span = 43.28 m
Experiments were carried out for two conditions of flow:
(a)
Corresponding to maximum designed flood level passing over the bridge deck.
(b)
Upstream water just grazing at bridge deck level.
The main objective of this study was to determine the coefficient of drag, (C
d) and the
coefficient of lift (C,)
(c)
For similitude between prototype and model, the scales selected were 1:25 and 1:75
geometric. The former for detailed measurement of coefficient of lift (C ) with the
help of piezometric taps, and coefficient of drag (C
d) was measured with help of
strain gauge on
1 :75 scale model.

As can be seen form result in above table that variation in value of coefficient of drag
(i.e. C d ) obtained during model studies at IIT Mumbai was very small, maximum value
ofC J obtained is
1 .79 and minimum
1 .55 for normal flow. Also there is no substantial
difference in value of C d under oblique flow. However, it is seen that value of C d
(Coefficient of drag) are more than 1.5 i.e. the values recommended by (IRC:6),
and therefore, thrust-blocks were provided
to prevent sliding of the
superstructure, (ref. Drawing Annexure-A-1 & A-2).
(f)
It was informed by IIT, Mumbai that the coefficient of lift (C,) observed during model
experiments includes buoyancy i.e. hydrostatic effects also. The variation in coefficient
of lift (C,) values obtained for different conditions of submergence were large varying
from 0.04 to 2.10 as given in Table 4.10 above. The value of C, obtained in
model studies gave indication that streamlined shape of superstructure are
also likely to be unstable against lift forces and need extra anchorages to
prevent lifting of the superstructure.
4.2.
Submersible Bridge at Bhima River-Maharashtra
In absence of more information for value of 'k' in IRC code for Aerofoil box type
superstructure it was decided by Maharashtra Govt, to get model studies done at CWPRS,
Pune. The Aerofoil deck adopted for submersible bridge at Bhima river is given in

The model studies were carried out to evaluate coefficient ofdrag and lift forces for different
depths of submergence and velocities on Aerofoil shaped box girder.
(b)
The piezometric observations were done on models with approach velocities ranging from
6.0 m/sec for submergence of the deck slab by 5. 1 3 m, and other with water level grazing
deck slab's top and having approach velocity 4.0 m/sec. The coefficient of drag (C
d)
varied from 0.37 to 2. 1 0 for the above range of velocities. These variations in C d values
are plotted as a function of Reynold's Number for different submergences and are shown
in Fig. 4.12.

varied from 0.04 to 0.41

From the above values ofC d and C, as worked out after model studies on Bhima Bridge,
the following inferences can be drawn:
(a)
Coefficient of Drag (Cd)
(i)
Values of C d shows a tendency to decrease as value ofR
g (Reynold's Number )
increases.
(ii)
The coefficient of drag (C d ) varies with depth of submergence
(iii)
For very low R
e the value ofC d is abnormally high.
(b)
Coefficient of Lift (C,)
Values of C, vary with R
e (Reynold's Number). For low R
e and maximum
submergence, the coefficient of lift C, is the highest attaining value of (-) 0.86.

The Tests carried out by Central Water and Power Research Station (period 1938 to
1 942) pertain to the solid slab deck where the width to depth ratio is very high (in range of
1 2 to
1 5) and velocities simulated were in low range of 1 .83 m/sec to 2.44 m/sec in prototype
i.e. 0.56 m/sec to 0.74 m/sec in model. Comparison of these results with recent model
studies done for Box Aerofoil Superstructures for Chambal and Bhima river bridge will not
be correct. Moreover, observations carried out by the Central Water and Power Research
Station in 1 940 were only qualitative in nature for estimating the lift force.
4.4.2.
Recent studies carried out by I.I.T. Mumbai for Chambal river bridge and by Central
Water Research Station for Bhima river bridge have been examined in depth.
It will be
noticed that though the shape of deck of Chambal bridge and Bhima river bridge are
apparently similar but there are some difference's also. The overall width ofdecks of both
the bridges are more or less the same as also the width of straight portion of soffit, but the
depth ofthe box being different, therefore, the angle subtended by inclined soffit with deck
top for Chambal bridge is 37.875° and the same for Bhima river bridge is only 22.25°.
Due to this, there is a difference in the aspect ratio (width to depth). In the former case this
ratio is 3.85, while in the latter it is 5.678 and this inequality could give rise to different
streamlines. As a result, the values of C^ and C, are bound to be different in these two case
studies also.

Inferences from Model Studies at IIT, Mumbai for Chambal Bridge on NH-3.
(i)
The Indian Institute ofTechnology (IIT) Mumbai carried out model studies by adopting
geometric scale of 1:25, with model Reynold's Number of about lxlO
5 which is
58



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
considered close to hydraulically unsteady zone. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt
more appropriate scale.
(ii)
In IIT Mumbai model studies, the variation in values of total drag was very small.
Maximum C
, total is
1 .79 and minimum C
, total is
1 .55 for normal flow. Also, there
is no substantial difference in value of Cd total' under oblique flow. However, the
values of C d obtained are more than 1.5, the value as recommended by the Indian
Roads Congress for superstructure.
(iii)
Variations in coefficient of lift (C,) obtained under different conditions are very large
giving its values from 0.04 to 2. 10. As a matter of fact, these values give rise to an
apprehension that such streamlined shaped bodies are likely to be unstable against
flowing water and, therefore, should be used with caution and need extra anchorages
to prevent lifting up of the sub-structure, are to be provided (as done in case of
Chambal bridge at Dholpur).
4.4.4.
Inferences from Model Studies
at CWPRS Pune for Bhima River Bridge-
Maharashtra
The graph ofC d vs. Re obtained in model tests carried out at CWPRS, Pune, gives higher
values ofCd for rectangular shape box than stream line box under maximum submergence.
As for condition for water level at deck level, coefficient of drag for rectangular box section
is less than the stream line section.
It is difficult to explain why Cd is lower for rectangular
shaped box compared to Aerofoil shaped box.

5. WATERWAY AND AFFLUX
5.1. Waterway
5.1.1. General
The area through which the water flows under a bridge superstructure is known as the
waterway of the bridge. The linear measurement of the waterway along the bridge is
known as linear waterway. The linear waterway is equal to the sum ofthe length of all the
clear spans. The natural waterway is the unobstructed area of flow of the river/stream at
the bridge site.
The waterway adopted should be adequate to pass the design flood of specific Return
Period. The opening has to be capable of passing the design-flood without overtopping
the deck in case ofhigh level bridges, and the design floods estimated upto a level at which
the deck is fixed in case of submersible bridges, without endangering these structures.
5.1.2.
Fixing deck level of submersible bridges
(i)
Specific number ofovertopping the deck is permitted during annual floods in case
of submersible structures, which are primarily low cost and economical solutions
compared to high level structures. It is, therefore, necessary to first decide the
permissible duration and frequency of such overtoppings.
(ii)
Generally, it has been observed that high flood occurs three to four times during
monsoon, but water level rises so fast and falls again so rapidly that the peak level
of these floods lasts only for a short time.
If level of floods is plotted on vertical
axis and dates of floods on horizontal axis, then one can easily decide about the
deck level as seen from Graph 5.1 which is a typical example ofyearly floods in a
river during monsoon.
(iii)
Based on the flood data during monsoon season, the deck level of submersible
bridge is so fixed that the facility will satisfy the criteria of frequency and time
period of interruptions to traffic as specified by user Authority and as indicated in
Graph 5.1

Table 3.1 ofthese guidelines. The concerned Department has to collect flood data
for a representative monsoon season and decide the OFL above which deck level
of submersible bridge is so fixed that it satisfies the criteria offrequency and time
period of interruptions of traffic.
.
5.1.3. Constriction of waterway
(i)
Any constriction of waterway either laterally or vertically reduces the natural
waterway of stream which results in change in normal flow pattern from that existing
before the constriction and in afflux on upstream. Higher the constriction of natural
waterway, higher will be the afflux and the velocity of flow through the vents. It is
therefore, desirable to keep the constriction of waterway to the minimum in order
to reduce expenditure on providing raised face walls and protection ofbed. However
constriction to varying degrees becomes unavoidable, depending on the type of
structure that may be selected for adoption based on various other technical and
economic considerations. The constriction of waterway that can be permitted in
any particular case depends on several site specific conditions the more important
ones being the nature of soil in the river bed and the adopted Road Top Level
(RTL) in relation to the design HFL.
(a)
If the bed material is easily erodible,
it would be desirable to avoid high
constriction to keep the velocity of flow through the vents within manageable
limits.
(b)
Similarly, higher constriction can be provided for low level submersible
structures like causeways but, ifthe depth of flow below RTL in relation to the
depth below the design HFL is high as would generally be the case when
higher submersible bridges are provided, the constriction must be kept low so
as to keep the hydrostatic forces on the structure within manageable limits.
(ii)
Several States in the country, which have been constructing submersible structures
for a long time, have their own practices with regard to the permissible constriction,
based on their experience and site conditions prevailing in the respective States.
These practices may vary from State to State and it is recommended that the States
may continue to follow their successful practices in this regard. Alternatively, the
following recommendations maybe followed:
(a)
For low level submersible structures like causeways, provide a vent area of
about 40 per cent but not less than 30 per cent of the unobstructed area of the
stream measured between the proposed road top level and the stream bed. In
scanty rainfall areas where annual rainfall is less than 600 mm, the vent area
can be reduced upto 20 per cent to 30 per cent of unobstructed area. However,
the available area of flow under design HFL condition should always be at
least 70 per cent of the unobstructed area of flow between the design HFL
and the stream bed i.e. the obstruction under design HFL condition should not

(b)
For submersible bridges, which would generally be provided with relatively
higher road top level, the available area offlow under the structure should not
be less than 70 per cent of the unobstructed area of the stream measured
between the stream bed profile and the proposed road top level.
(iii)
RTL should not be abnormally high over vent opening as this causes heading up of
water on u/s which in turn may result in high velocity (it can even be in the range of
hypercritical) leading to failure and out flanking. Hence RTL should be kept as low
as possible.
(iv)
The increase in velocity under the bridge should be kept below the allowable safe
velocity for the bed material. Typical values of safe velocities for different bed
material are as below:
Type of Material
Safe Velocity (m/sec)
Loose clay and fine sand
upto0.5
Coarse sand
upto
1 .0
Fine gravel, sandy or shift clay
upto
1 .5
Coarse Gravel/Weathered rock/
Boulders upto 200 mm size
upto 2.5
Larger boulders
(200- 800 mm size) or rocky strata
2.5 to 6.0
(v)
In case the velocity exceeds the above specified values for scourable beds, then
bed protection consisting of flooring with proper cut-off wall should be provided
on both upstream and downstream side on the bridge as discussed in detail in para
6.4 of Chapter 6. A typical arrangement of floor protection works is given in
Fig. 5.1.
(vi)
In the post protection works, the velocity off] ow under structure should not exceed
2 m/sec. The depth of drop wall should be such that it does not get undermined.
If
a flooring is not provided, then maximum depth of scour should be calculated
carefully and depth of foundations be provided accordingly.
5.2.
Afflux
5.2.1. General
(i)
Afflux can be defined as a rise/heading up of water surface above normal water
level on the upstream side of a bndg.^.
It is caused when the effective 'linear
waterway' through the bridge is less than he natural width ofthe stream immediately
upstream of obstruction. Afflux era also be caused in case of a bridge where there
is reduction in overall width of the waterway over the natural width of stream, due
to the obstruction of piers and projecting abutments as indicated in Fig. 5.2.
(ii)
Afflux governs the dynamic action o r water current. The greater the afflux greater
will be the fall of water level from upstream to downstream and therefore greater

5.2.3.
Estimation of afflux by broad crested weir and orifice formulae
The afflux (h), the discharge (Q) the unobstructed stream width (W) and the linear
waterway (L) are all interrelated. Greater the reduction in linear waterway, the greater is
the afflux. Since downstream depth (D
d) is not affected by the bridge obstruction as the
same is governed by the hydraulic characteristics of the channel downstream, it can be
safely assumed that the upstream (u/s) depth which prevailed before the bridge construction
is same as the downstream depth (D
d) that prevails even after the bridge construction.
Hence (Dd) is the depth that prevailed at bridge site before the construction of the bridge.
To estimate afflux we must know the discharge (Q) in the channel, the value ofD
, value
ofW and L, then afflux can be calculated by applying weir and orifice formula as given
below.

Precautions to be taken in the design for reducing afflux and its effects on

In a submersible bridge the entire cross-sectional area ofthe superstructure also obstructs

IRC:SP:82-2008
Further high afflux increases velocity which causes high moments on pier foundations.
In order
that excessive afflux and thereby hypercritical velocity are not created, following precautions are
to be taken:
(i)
The deck level ofsubmersible bridge should be kept low. If the deck level is kept
high i.e. near the HFL where velocity of flow is the highest, then greater afflux is
created and moments due to hydrodynamic forces are more severe at the foundation
level.
(ii)
The bed erosion and afflux are interlinked and dependenfon one hand on the amount
of constriction and obstruction caused by the bridge and approaches and also on
the other hand on the type of hydrograph for the river obtained.
In a river with
gradually increasing and sustained floods, the full bed scour would develop giving
negligible afflux while in flashy rivers the time for bed scour may not be adequate
thereby causing very high afflux.
It has been observed that the afflux upstream of
Mokamah Bridge on Ganga River which has sustained floods, was much less than
the afflux created on upstream of the'bridge on Luni River in Rajasthan with
predominantly sandy beds but which has flash floods.
(iii)
The percentage of obstructions to the flood discharge is maximum when the flood
rises just upto the top level ofthe submersible bridge.
It is well known that percentage
of obstruction to flood water goes on diminishing as the flood water rises above the
submersible bridge, since the area obstructed remains constant and at any further
higher floods the percentage of obstruction becomes much smaller. Obviously the
conditions causing erosion ofbanks and subsequent outflanking are when the afflux
is maximum i.e. water level including afflux is touching top ofdeck ofthe submersible
bridge. Therefore, in short, this is one of the critical conditions for the design of
submersible bridge.
(iv)
In order to ensure that the actual afflux as created remains low and does not exceed
the calculated value, so that the road surface becomes dry as quickly as possible
for the passage of the traffic, it is necessary to adopt methods as suggested below
so as to maximize the discharging capacity ofthe causeways/submersible bridge
for a given afflux:
(a)
Increasing the coefficient ofdischarge ofthe vents. The co-efficient ofdischarge
through normal kind of vents used in causeways/submersible bridge is of the
order of about 78 to 80 per cent but experiments have indicated that a provision
of bell-mouth entries for the vents on the upstream side increases the co-
efficient to about 88 per cent.
(b)
Similarly the upstream edges ofthe approach roads under submergence should
also be rounded off to ensure streamline flow and enhance the discharging
capacity.

IRC:SP:82-2008
In alluvial bed, even where rigid flooring is not provided, suitable reliefdue to
scouring ofbed may not be considered in the calculation of area of flow and
afflux.
The size ofvents should be fixed such that the obstruction to the flow ofwater
at the stage when it touches the top ofdeck slab, is less than 60 per cent or at
the most 70 per cent.

6. SCOUR AND FOUNDATIONS
6.1.
Scour
6.1.1.
General
Scour is the erosive action offlowing water and carrying away ofthe resultant loose material
from the watercourse bed. The deepening ofbed (extent ofscour) mainly depends on characteristics
of watercourse and its bed (e.g. presence of rifts, deep pools, weeds, stones/boulders, bends,
longitudinal slope, straight/meandering reach, particle size ofbed material, velocity ofwater during
floods, resistance of bed to erosion etc.) and duration of floods. The scouring action in natural
watercourses is also not generally uniform throughout the bed width and it inter alia depends on
concentration offlow and constriction caused by the structure. The scour is deeper in the vicinity
of the pier foundation because the velocity and turbulence offlow around piers and its foundation
is higher than the average velocity of flow. The scour is an important parameter for fixing the size,
type, depth of foundations and also span arrangements of a submersible structure and should
therefore, be carefully determined keeping in view the site conditions, observed values of normal
scour in the unobstructed reach ofwatercourse and maximum observed scour around the foundations
of structures in the vicinity on the same watercourse etc.
In case of submersible bridges in erodible bed, the scour will be more than that for a high
level bridge for any particular value ofdischarge . The main reason for this is the increased obstruction
in the waterway due to submergence of super structure which increases both the velocity of flow
and its turbulence and the difference is likely to the maximum when the flood level is just about to
overtop the deck. After this level, the percentage of obstruction with respect to the total cross-
sectional area of the channel reduces appreciably as may be seen in a worked out example at
Appendix 6.1. This will, however happen only if the duration of the flood corresponding to the
deck level, is long enough to scour the bed and transport the bed materials. The scour depths for
submersible structures should therefore, be calculated under different flood levels i.e. Ordinary
Flood Level (OFL), flood level just touching the deck level and HFL to determine the design scour
depth.
The scour under the submersible structures especially around pier foundations can, if
required, be controlled either by siting the bridge where rock is available at shallow depth or by the
provision of suitably designed floor protection around the structure.
6.1.2.
Design discharge for determination of scour depth
6.1.2.1. In order to provide for an adequate margin of safety, IRC:78 recommends that
the scour for foundations (except raft foundations) should be determined based on a discharge
larger than the design discharge determined as per Chapter 4 of these guidelines. The values of
increment to be adopted for different ranges of catchment areas are given in Table 6.1 for ready
reference. Unless otherwise specified by Design Engineer, these values may be adopted in case of
submersible structures.

* Percentage increase over design discharge for intermediate values of catchment areas may

6.1.3. Normal scour
6.1.3.1. Normal scour level, is the level of the scoured bed that is likely to occur during
design floods. As regime conditions seldom exist in natural streams and because of limited duration
of any flood, the relationships given by Lacey for alluvial streams are not strictly applicable.
However, in the absence of any other recommendations based on further research work/experience
gained, these relationships are widely adopted to get an idea of expected scour and the same may
also be adopted in case of submersible structures.
6.1.3.2. According to Lacey, the scour parameters in case of alluvial streams depend only
on discharge (Q) and silt factor (K
f). The value of silt factor depends on size and looseness of the
grains ofthe alluvium and may be determined by the following expression:
K
= 1.76 Vd
...
(6.1)
sf
111
v
'
Where d
is the weighted mean diameter of the bed particles in millimetre.
The basic parameters are calculated from the following expressions:
(i)
Wetted Perimeter (P) = C VQ
...
(6.2)
Where Q is discharge during floods and C is a constant dependent
on local conditions and may vary from 4.5 to 6.3. However, value
of 4.8 is generally adopted in design.
(ii)
Hydraulic mean radius (R) = 0.473 (Q/ K f)
1/3
...
(6.3)
In case of wide alluvial streams, width (W) is assumed equal to the
wetted perimeter (P) and normal depth ofbed (normal scour depth )
below water level equal to 'R'.
6.1.4. Mean depth of scour
6.1.4.1. The mean scour depth below designed flood level for natural channels flowing
over scourable bed is generally calculated from the following equation:

Silt factor for a representative sample of bed material obtained upto the

6.1
[ 1 .76 VdJ and dm is the mean weighted mean diameter in millimetre.
* The discharge per meter width may be calculated from the following two conditions :-
(i)
When the flood level touches the top of the wearing coat
(ii)
During floods, based on the width of compartments of the flow area under
consideration and the calculated discharge for the same (As described in para 4. 1 .4)
The weighted mean diameter ofparticles for a stratum may be worked out as per procedure
illustrated in Appendix 6.2.
6.1.4.2.
In the absence of sieve analysis of the bed material of different strata upto
anticipated deepest scour, the values ofK
sf for various grades of bed materials as given in Table
6.2 may be adopted for estimation of scour depth for the preparation of preliminary project reports.
The detailed design of foundations should, however be based on the sieve analysis of different
strata upto the anticipated deepest scour likely to be met with at the site.

6.1.5. The anticipated maximum depth of scour should be determined after considering all
the relevant local conditions over a reasonable period of time. In this regard the following aspects
may be kept in view in deciding the maximum scour depth:
( a)
Wherever possible, soundings for the purpose of determining the depth of scour should
be taken in the vicinity ofthe site proposed for the bridge. Findings of such soundings
are best when taken during or immediately after a flood before the scour holes have
had time to silt up appreciably
(b)
The design discharge being greater than the flood discharge at the time of taking
soundings
(c)
The increase in velocity due to obstruction to flow caused by the construction of the
bridge; bed protection, approaches, training works etc. and
(d)
The increase in scour depth in the proximity of piers and guide bunds.

PAGE 85 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
(e)
Ifthere is any appreciable concentration offlow in any part ofwaterway due to bend
of the watercourse in immediate upstream or downstream or for any other reason,
like wide variation in the type ofbed material across the width ofchannel, the waterway
may be divided into compartments as per the concentration of flow and the mean
scour depth may be calculated separately for each compartment.
(f)
If the watercourse is of a flashy nature and bed does not lend itself to the scouring
effect of floods, the theoretical expressions for dsm derived from equation 6.4 and
maximum depth of scour indicated under para 6.2 below should not be applied and
maximum depth should be assessed from actual observations.
6. 1 .6. No rational formula or data for determining scour depth for bed material consisting
of gravels and boulders (normally having weighted diameter more than 2.00 mm) is available. In
such cases, scour depth may be determined by actual observations and mean scour depth fixed
based on such observations and theoretical calculations.
6.1.7.
Similarly in the absence ofany established relationship for determining the value of
K
rf or scour depth in clayey bed, the following theoretical calculations for determining the value of
silt factor (K
sf) for clayey bed material may be adopted:
(i)
In case of soil having 0 (angle of internal friction) < 1 5° and
c (cohesion of soil) >0.2 kg/cm2
,
K
rf =
F(l + VcT)
...
(6.5)
Where,
c is in kg/cm2
F
=
1.50 for 0> 10°and<15°
=
1.75 for 0> 5° and < 10°
=
2.00 for 0<5°
(ii)
Soils having 0> 1 5° may be treated as sandy soil even if value of c is more than
0.20 kg/cm2 and silt factor worked out as per Expression 6. 1
.

site, maximum scour below designed flood level for the design of floor protection works for raft or
open foundations may be based on following relationships. However for raft foundation d
may
be based on design discharge without any increase.

6.2.5. Special studies for the increased discharge calculated as per para 6. 1 .2, should be
undertaken for determining the maximum scour depth for the design of foundations of major
submersible bridges in all situations where abnormal conditions, such as the following are
encountered:
(i)
the site being located in a bend ofthe river involving a curvilinear flow, or excessive
shoal formation, or
(ii)
where the deep channel in the watercourse hugs to one side or
(iii)
very thick piers/arch structures, are existing or being proposed inducing heavy local
scours, or

(iv)
where the obliquity in the watercourse is considerable, or
(v)
site is in the vicinity of a dam or weir, barrage or other irrigation structures where
concentration of flow, aggradation/ degradation ofbed etc. are likely to occur.

Calculate the value ofd
based on increased

value of discharge (as per Table 6.1) and
K
sf from sieve analysis (Appendix 6.2) or
Table 6.2, using Expression
6.4.
(In case ofraft foundations d
may be based
on the design discharge without any increase)
(ii)
Find out the depth of scour holes or deepest
bed level from the cross sections taken at
different locations (i.e. u/s, d/s and at site)
(iii)
Maximum depth of scour holes away from
piers, vented causeways in existing structures
in the vicinity ofproposed site
(iv)
Select the highest value among the D 1 , D2 and D3
.
(v)
Determine maximum depth of scour as per para 6.2. above.
For Submersible bridges, the scour level is determined for the following two conditions
(i)
When the flood level is at the top of the bridge with live load on it.
(ii)
When the flood level is HFL with no live load;
A worked out example of determination of anticipated maximum scour depths for a typical
case is given in Appendix 6.1. It is seen that the scour level at former condition is different than the
later (HFL) case.
6.3.
Foundations
6.3.1.
General
As mentioned in Chapter 3 of these guidelines, submersible bridges should normally be
sited where rocky or firm strata is available at relatively shallow depths and construction ofhigh
embankments in submersible portion of immediate approaches is not involved. As such these
structures would generally have shallow foundations, rendering open or raft foundation suitable. In
case of sandy strata or soft soils requiring deeper foundations, well or pile foundations can be
adopted. In case of bridges/causeways on erodible bed, the bed is protected against scour by
provision of suitably designed flooring with cut off walls and launching aprons on either side.

======================================================================
PAGE 89 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
However, in case the bed protection is not feasible or economically viable, deep well or pile
foundations are also adopted.
6.3.2.
Types of foundations
Choice oftype of foundations for the selected type of structure and span arrangement has
to be based on the sub-soil investigations and data ofexisting structures in the vicinity. Foundations
can be broadly divided into two categories viz. shallow foundations and deep foundations.
6.3.2.1. Shallow foundations
Shallow foundations are adopted where suitable hard strata which is not erodible and
having adequate safe bearing capacity (SBC) of about 150 kN/m
2 or more is available at shallow
depth below bed level of the watercourse. Shallow foundations are preferred for submersible
bridges because they are economical and easy to execute. In case of sandy stratum extending to
considerable depth, shallow foundations are adopted by restricting the scour to the top of suitably
designed bed protection. Shallow foundations are categorized into following types:
(i)
Isolated open foundations:
Isolated open foundations are generally adopted where the safe bearing capacity
(SBC) ofabout 150 kN/m
2 or more is available at shallow depths. However, if sub
soil is porous and water table is high this type of foundation would be feasible only
upto 3 to 4 m below the bed.
(ii)
Raft foundations:
Foundation block covering the entire length and width of the proposed bridge
structure is commonly known as raft foundation. It is adopted when good founding
strata is not available within reasonable depth or SBC. of top stratum is less than
100 kN/m
2
. The concrete raft serves to distribute pressure evenly to the sandy
surface/ clayey strata and also the arch action of the foundation block helps in
distributing the loads evenly. Another economical alternative in such situation is the
adoption of multiple continuous box type structure using full box section as a beam
on elastic foundation.
6.3.2.2. Deep foundations
If suitable founding stratum is available only at a depth greater than 6 m with substantial
depth of standing water and large scour depth then execution of open foundations and the bed
protection works becomes difficult. In such a situation it is advisable to adopt well foundations or
pile foundations
(a)
Well Foundations:
This is one of the most popular types of deep foundations in India, due to various
reasons like simplicity, requirements of very little equipment for execution, and
adaptability to different subsoil conditions/difficult site conditions like deep standing
water and availability of good founding strata at large depths etc.

IRC:SP:82-2008
(b)
Pile Foundations: - Pile foundations are also viable alternative. Large diameter
piles some times prove to be a good alternative to conventional well type foundations.
IRC:78 may be referred for detailed information with regard to various types of
pile foundations and their suitability.
6.3.3. Minimum depth of foundation
Foundations of any"structure including cut-off walls should be deep enough and safe to
transfer loads and force transmitted through sub-structure under worst combination of loads and
forces specified in IRC:6, IRC: 78 and Chapter 7 ofthese guidelines. However the minimum depth
of open foundations shall be as follows:
(i)
In erodible strata - not be less than 2.0 m below the scour level or the protected
bed level.
(ii)
In Rock
(a)
For hard rock, with an ultimate crushing strength of 1 0 MPa
or more, arrived at after considering the overall characteristics
of the rock such as fissures, bedding planes etc.
:
0.6 m
(b)
All other cases
:
1.5 m
6.4.
Bed Protection or Floor Protection for Shallow Foundations
6.4.1.
General
In case of causeways and submersible structures, where adoption of shallow foundations
becomes economical by restricting the scour, bed (floor) protection to the structures has to be
provided. The bed protection is provided to guard against scour and undermining (washing away
or disturbance by piping action etc.) which can be quite severe in the case of vented causeways
and submersible structures. The bed/floor protection consists of the following components:
(i)
upstream flexible apron;
(ii)
upstream cut-off wall;
(iii)
rigid flooring;
(iv)
downstream cut-off wall and;
(v)
downstream flexible apron
The sizes ofvarious components ofbed/floor protection are fixed on the basis of experience
of previous such works and then checked for the adequacy for the proposed structure. The length
of flexible apron is fixed keeping in view the. shape of apron in launched position to protect the
foundations of cut-off walls as well as main foundations of the structure from being undermined.
However, it is essential that the performance of rigid flooring and flexible apron is kept under
watch, especially on the downstream side, for first few floods after construction and remedial
measures should be taken immediately in the form of replenishment of boulders disturbed during
the floods.
In extreme cases, it may become necessary subsequently to increase the length of
downstream apron in case the performance proves it to be inadequate.
The work ofbed protection should be completed simultaneously along with the work on
the causeway or foundations of the structure to prevent any damage due to unexpected floods
even during the construction stage.
80



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
6.4.2. The floor protection should be properly designed as per the detailed guidelines
contained in IRC: 89. However the minimum specifications for floor protection are given below for
guidance. These may be adopted in the absence of any other more rigorous requirements/rational
design.
(i)
The post construction velocity under the structure should not exceed 2 m/s and the
intensity of discharge is limited to 3m7m except in the case of properly designed raft
foundation with adequate protective works.
(ii)
The rigid flooring under the structure should extend for a distance of at least 3 m on
upstream side and 5 m on downstream side of the structure. However if splayed wing
walls are provided, the flooring should extend upto the line connecting the end of the
wing walls on either side ofthe structure. In case of well designed raft foundation with
upstream and downstream cut-off walls, the depth of cut-off walls and length of flooring
(apron) could be suitably changed depending on the successful practice followed in the
State.
(iii)
The top ofthe flooring should be kept 300 mm below the lowest bed level to prevent the
flooring from acting as a weir when retrogression of levels take place.
(iv)
The flooring may consist of 1 50 mm thick flat stone/bricks on edge in cement mortar 1
:
3
laid over 300 mm thick cement concrete Ml 5 grade over a layer of 150 mm thick
cement concrete M10. In case of streams carrying abrasive particles with velocities
higher than 4 m/sec, an alternative specification of flooring comprising of450 mm thick
concrete layer in M20 over
1 50 mm thick concrete layer in M 1 5 grade can be adopted.
Spacing of the joints should be limited to about 20 m.
(v)
The rigid flooring should be enclosed by cut-off/curtain walls (tied to the wing walls)
with a minimum depth below floor level of 2 m on upstream side and 2.5 m on down
stream side. The cut-off/curtain walls should be in cement concrete Ml 5 grade/brick/
stone masonry in cement mortar
1 :3. The rigid flooring shall be continued over the top
width ofthe cut-off/curtain walls. Horizontal/vertical joints in curtain/cut-offwalls should
be avoided.
(vi)
Flexible apron 1 m thick comprising of loose stone boulders (weighing not less than 40
kg) should be provided beyond the curtain/cut-off walls. The length of apron on the
downstream side should be adequate to launch upto the designed maximum scour level
in a slope of2 horizontal to
1 vertical and the length of apron on the upstream should not
be less than about 0.7 times of the same on downstream side subject to a minimum
length of 4 m on upstream side and 6 m on downstream side. In case required size of
stones are not economically available, stones in wire crates or cement concrete blocks
may be used in place of specified stones.
(vii) Crated boulder aprons should also be preferred at sites near inhabited areas so as to
discourage removal of stones by anti-social and unscrupulous elements.
(viii) It is essential that the work ofbed protection is simultaneously completed along with the
work on the foundations of the structure to prevent any damage to the foundations.
(ix)
Typical arrangements of flooring with cut-off walls etc. are indicated in Fig. 5.1 in
Chapter 5 and
Fig. 6.1.

6.4.3.
Design
6.4.3.1. When a rigid (Pukka) floor is provided, the water in addition to flowing over the
floor also creates a path for itself along the surfaces ofthe upstream cut-off wall and the under side
ofthe floor protection to finally emerge on the downstream side. Ifthe exit gradient of water when
it emerges is high then it would be capable of carrying soil particles with it. This leads to piping
action, which can cause progressive loss ofmaterial from under the floor resulting finally in damage
or collapse ofthe floor. To prevent this from happening, the dimensions of the rigid flooring have
to be such as to keep the exit gradient quite low. The theories used for design of weirs on alluvial
soils are generally used for checking the exit gradient ofwater under the rigid flooring ofthe bridge.
However, in case of causeways/ submersible bridges, difference in depth ofwater on the upstream
side and downstream side (pressure head) is only due to the afflux. Since a large value of afflux
cannot be permitted in the design of submersible structures, the pressure head is very small when
compared with the depth ofwater on downstream side. However, for purposes ofdesign, difference
of depth of say
1 m may be assumed between the upstream and downstream sides of submersible
bridges and vented causeways with floors and 500 mm in case of flush causeways which generally
span the whole waterway.
6.4.3.2. There are three methods of checking the adequacy ofthe proposed sizes of different
components ofbed protection, viz:
(i)
Bligh's creep theory
(ii)
Lane's weighted creep theory, and
(iii)
Khosla's method of independent variables applied to potential theory.
The salient points useful for the design ofcut-offwalls and aprons for finding out the hydraulic
gradient at exit for the flooring are given below for ready reference and guidance.
(i)
Bligh's Creep Theory: As per this theory the total equivalent length ofwater path
(creep length) is given by
CxH = L + 2(d, + d
2 )
...
(6.26)
Where,
H
=
Pressure head, taken as equal to depth ofwater on upstream side including afflux (-)
depth ofwater on downstream side.
(Minimum values of pressure head for submersible bridges/vented causeways and
flush causeway may be assumed as
1 .00 m and 500 mm respectively.)
L
=
Total length of all horizontal contact surfaces ofwater path.
d
=
depth ofupstream cut-off wall
d 2
=
depth ofdownstream cut-off wall
(According to Bligh's theory, vertical cut-offs are twice as effective as horizontal
flooring in contributing to creep length and the rate ofhead loss along the creep length
is assumed to be linear.
)
C
=
a constant called creep coefficient. The values ofC for different soils are as given in
Table 6.3.

(ii)
Lane's Theory: This is based on statistical study of performance of actual structures on
permeable foundations, a greater weightage is given to the vertical cut-offs than horizontal
water contacts and is assumed in the ratio of 3
: 1
. The creep length (equivalent length of
water path) works out to be
C,H= 1/3 L + (d, +d
2 )
...
(6.27)
Where C, = weighted creep coefficient as given in Table 6.3.
Lane's approach, though an improvement over Bligh's creep theory, still has the limitation
ofan empirical method. This is however, commonly used to cross check the adequacy of
the proposed designs based on Bligh's Creep Theory.
(iii)
Khosla's Theory: When the subsoil is homogeneous, Khosla's method of independent
variables applied to the theory of sub-soil flow is the most reliable. In case offloor protection
with cut-off walls on either end, the exit gradient (G E ) is worked out by the Expression:
(G F )

depth of downstream cut off wall.
As per Khosla's theory, the depth of up-stream cut off wall does not have any
effect on exit gradient and, as such, only the depth of down-stream cut off wall
is considered)
length ofthe floor
To safeguard against undermining, the exit gradient should not exceed the numerical value
of unity. However, in order to provide adequate factor of safety, the dimensions ofthe cut-offs and
floor should be selected in such a way that the exit gradient does not exceed the permissible values
indicated in Table 6.4.

6.4.3.3. To find the required thickness of floor, the uplift pressures at salient points are
calculated and the thickness necessary to counter this uplift pressure is determined. To investigate
the adequacy ofthe proposed thickness offlooring, the values recommended in 'Design of Weirs
on Permeable Foundation' - Central Board of Irrigation Publication No. 12 are generally adopted
(Relevant Table and Graphs are reproduced at Appendix 6.3).
6.4.3.4. Beyond the rigid flooring, flexible aprons of designed length are provided on
either side to keep the scour holes at safe distance. The size and weight of stones/boulders required
for launching apron to resist mean design velocity (average velocity) is given by the expression:
v = 4.893 (d)
1/2
Where,
v

mean design velocity in m/s
d

blocks and stones in combination may be used in place of isolated stones of equivalent weight. Cement
concrete blocks should however, be preferred wherever possible.
In all the above cases, the pressure at the base ofthe foundation should be well within the
safe bearing capacity ofthe foundation material.
Worked out example for investigating the adequacy of bed protection, depth of cut off
walls is given in Appendix 6.4.

DESIGN OF BED PROTECTION
(Worked out example)
Given Data:
Design discharge
Total effective waterway
Depth of flow above floor level at designed flood level
Afflux
Width ofthe foundation
Mean designed velocity
(Maximum permissible velocity as per IRC: 89 is 2.0 m/s)
Area available for discharge
-
250x 2.70
Discharging capacity
=
675 x2
Width ofthe foundation
Length of flooring as per IRC:89
= 10.0 + 3.0 + 5.0
{Para 6.4.2 (ii) refers}
Depth of upstream side cut-off wall
(Minimum required as per IRC: 89 is 2.0 m)
Depth of downstream side cut-off wall
(Minimum required as per IRC: 89 is 2.50 m)
(i)
As per Bligh's Creep Theory
Total length of water path
=2 x 2.50 + 18 + 2 x 3.50 = 30.0 m
Assume difference of head between upstream and downstream sides as
1 .0 m as per Para
6.4.3. 1 against value of afflux of 500 mm.
Hydraulic gradient = 1.0/30.0 i.e.
1 in 30
As the gradient of 1 in 30 is far less than even the flattest permissible gradient of 1 in
1
8
(value of creep coefficient for very fine sand or silt), as per Table 6.4, the length of flooring
provided is adequate.
(ii)
As per Lane's Weighted Creep Theory
The equivalent length Lw = 1/3 x 18.0 + 2 x 2.50 + 2 x 3.50
=18.0 m
Creep ratio C

Thus the creep ratio is much higher than the requirement (Table 6.4 refers). Hence flooring
length provided is adequate.

The exit gradient is within the permissible values (Table 6.5)
Hence the proposed length of the floor as 18 m and depth of cut-off wall as 3.5 m are
adequate.
Check for adequacy of the thickness of the proposed flooring by Khosla Theory
Assume the following composition of the flooring as per Para 6.4.2 (iv):

DESIGN
7.1.
Site Inspections
7.1.1.
General
Site inspections play an important role right from the conception stage to the end of pre-
construction stage for successful implementation of any project. The purpose of site inspection
ranges from identification of data needs and collection of raw data at elemental level to an overall
appraisal ofthe project to aid in analysis, decision making and financing. As such, each inspection
should be carefully planned keeping in view the requirements of the user authority and to aid
judgments for most economical and feasible solution. The number of site inspections depend upon
the type of proposed submersible structure (i.e. flush/vented causeways, bridge) length, site
conditions, importance ofthe crossing etc.
The site inspections should be carried out by experienced bridge engineers as these form
the basis for arriving at the basic design parameters for the project, especially in case of submersible
structures and immediate approach roads which are subjected to frequent submergence.
7.1.2.
Types of site inspections
Based on the stage of the project, site inspections can be classified as under:
I
Pre-construction stage inspection
(i)
Pre-feasibility stage inspection
(ii)
Feasibility stage inspection
(iii)
Detailed engineering stage inspection
II
Construction/Implementation stage inspection
III
Post construction/Maintenance stage inspection
7.1.3. Broad requirements of site inspection
7.1.3.1. Pre-feasibility stage inspection
A reconnaissance visit to the area of the intended submersible structure site is generally
sufficient to examine the general area and to identify the project, its requirements, utility, present
arrangements of crossing, nature ofthe crossing, traffic intensity, land marks and broad features for
the crossing etc. The inspection report at this stage should give broad idea of area, intended
project and in general inter-alia cover the following:
(i)
Requirements of the user authority in charge ofthe road and its limitations, if any,
regarding availability of funds for the project;
(ii)
Category ofroad (i.e. SH/MDR/RR/E&I road/industrial road/link road etc.);
96

(xii)
Approximate depths ofwater and water spreads during dry season and floods (at
HFL, OFL and LWL)
(xiii)
Characteristics of river bed (i.e. alluvial, quasi-alluvial, presence of big boulders
affecting the velocity of stream, scourable or non-scourable etc.)
(xiv)
Presence of rocky strata
(xv)
Possible location of submersible structure with respect to the most suitable site
for the high level bridge
(xvi)

in a year and population affected
(xvii)
Expected land acquisition problems, if any, for immediate approaches
(xviii)
Broad details of existing CD works (bridges or causeways) on the same channel
in the vicinity. The details should include;
(a)
description like type, distance from the proposed site etc.
(b)
approximate length and depth of submergence and frequency (including
duration) of interruptions per year to traffic
(c)
number and length of spans/size of vents, clear waterway, adequacy or
otherwise ofwaterway with special reference to silted up spans or signs of
under scour or attacks on abutments and approaches in case of bridges
etc.

IRC:SP:82-2008
7.1.3.2. Feasibility stage inspection
During the feasibility stage, data in general, should be collected in line with the provisions
of IRC:5, IRC:78 & IRC:SP:54 (Project Preparation Manual) to enable the controlling authority
to take a decision about the type, length, foundation etc. of submersible structure.
At least one visit should be carried out in the beginning of this stage, to identify the data
required to be collected pertaining to the items mentioned under para 7. 1 .3. 1 above in various
stages and to establish coordination with different departments responsible for supply of data etc.
In case of a flush causeway, one or two site visits may be sufficient. However, in case of vented
causeway and submersible bridge, higher number of inspections for site data/conditions at various
stages should be planned to avoid major changes in the proposal at a later date. Officers from
design office should also inspect sites and review the adequacy of the data collected.
This stage is considered very important as the review ofthe data collected, recommendations
ofthe inspecting officers from field as well as from design wing form the basis of final selection of
the site, alignment, most importantly type ofthe structure i.e. flush or vented causeway or submersible
bridge and detailed engineering.
Since the selection of submersible structure, its design i.e. deck level, length of the bridge,
design of approaches mainly depends on the correctness ofthe flood levels, their spread, subsurface
investigations, due attention is to be paid to the analysis of the data. The assumptions made in
analysis, results and recommendations should have the approval ofthe competent authority.
Ajoint inspection by a team of officers of user authority and the executing agency (P.W.D.
or any other agency) of the finally selected site and approach alignment should invariably
be conducted
in case of important submersible structures having length more than 60 m to
avoid revision/modifications in the proposal at a later date i.e. during detailed engineering or execution
stage.
^
7.1.3.3.
Detailed engineering stage inspection
Frequent inspections during this stage are required to be carried out to ensure adequacy
and accuracy of investigations, data collection for proper identification of sources for materials,
preparation ofworking drawings for the structure at the finally approved site along with geometric
parameters with respect to the needs of the project and user authority, detailed specifications for
different items of work, bill of quantities and rates for realistic cost estimation.
7.1.3.4. Construction/Implementation stage inspection
Site inspections are carried out to ensure that assumptions made during the detailed design
are realised at site and to give further instructions to analyse the additional data collected during
actual execution/effect modifications in the working design drawings, quality assurance measures,
to remove bottlenecks/constraints for successful timely completion ofthe bridge project.

PAGE 109 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-20()8
7.1.3.5. Post construction/maintenance stage inspection
Regular inspections of submersible structures should be carried out as per the
guidelines given in IRC:SP: 1 8 (Manual for Highway Bridge Maintenance Inspection), IRC:SP:35
(Guidelines for Inspection and Maintenance of Bridges) and MOSRT&H Manual for Maintenance
of Roads 1983.
Box girder sections of submersible bridges shall be cleared of silt deposit after each flood
season.
7.2.
Site Selection
7.2.1.
The location of causeways should generally be governed by the approach roads
alignment except in difficult site conditions.
7.2.2.
The site for submersible structures should generally be selected down stream side
of the most suitable site for the high level bridge so that the same serves as diversion during the
construction ofhigh level bridge at a later date. The distance between the finally selected site for
the submersible bridge from the most suitable site for the high level bridge should be at least equal
to the tentative length for the high level bridge at that site, but not less than 50 m in any case.
Submersible bridge should generally be proposed on the upstream side ofthe existing causeway so
as to ensure that the afflux caused by the construction of the submersible bridge does not reduce
the functioning ofthe existing causeway.
7.2.3.
Factors affecting site selection
Some of the important factors requiring due consideration in the selection of a site are
listed below. Though it may not be possible to satisfy all attributes simultaneously, the selected site
should represent the most desirable mix of the attributes consistent with overall economy.
(a)
The reach of the watercourse on both u/s and d/s of the proposed site should be
straight to the extent possible. The straightness of reach ofthe watercourse ensures
uniform distribution of discharge and velocity. Curvature in the watercourse
especially on u/s side leads to concentration of flow and higher scour on concave
side. Ifthe bank on the concave side is erodible then it may lead to heavy recurring
expenditure in protecting the abutment and approach on that side.
(b)
The watercourse should not have the history of meandering i.e. changes in the
course at the site. (This can be ascertained from the past maps prepared over a
long time).
(c)
The bridge site should be sufficiently away from confluence of large tributaries,
where turbulence and obliquity of flow can be expected which results in higher
unpredictable scour and water current forces on the submersible structure, washing
away of approaches, batik eiDsion, out skirting the structure etc.
99



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
(d)
The banks should be well defined and fairly high at least for the OFL.
(e)
The watercourse should be narrow to ensure large average depth offlow compared
to maximum depth offlow in some reaches.
(f)
The site should offer possibilities of constriction in the waterway in the range of
2/3 to % ofthe waterway required for a high level bridge.
(g)
The bed conditions should offer good foundation conditions, preferably non-scouring
type (i.e. rock etc).
(h)
The site should offer straight approaches and square crossing.
(i)
The site should not involve construction ofhigh embankment in submersible portion
of approaches and/ or over exposed rocky strata.
7.3.
Essential Design Data
7.3.1.
General
Due attention should be paid to the collection and analysis of data and fixing of salient
design details of submersible bridges to avoid major changes in the proposal during execution or
excessive maintenance problems during service. Correct and proper presentation of data enables
the controlling authority to accord expeditious approvals to the details like length ofthe submersible
structure, approaches, type of the structure, foundations, deck level, bed and slope protection to
the approaches etc.
Hydrologic data and river characteristics play an important role in deciding the salient
details of submersible structures as these are subjected to frequent submergence with possibility of
washing off/dislodgment of superstructure from the substructure/excessive damage to sub structure
and foundation because of higher water forces, deeper scour as compared to high level bridges.
Similarly, portions of approaches are submerged during floods with possibility of breaches or
excessive damages/washing off and require heavy and properly designed protection works with
proper drainage system. As such a dedicated team of officers and workers should be assigned the
job of collection of essential data in case of submersible structures to avoid major changes in the
proposal at a later date or heavy recurring maintenance cost.
7.3.2.
Collection and presentation of design data
Collection and presentation of design data should be done as per the provisions contained
in IRC:5, IRC:78 and IRC:SP:54 on the subject.
Some of the essential maps and plans to be prepared and design data to be collected is
listed in Appendix 7.1 for guidance.

Design Flood Level, Road Top Level/Deck Level
Design flood level is fixed based on the number and duration of interruptions to traffic in a
year or in specific period i.e. annually/ 5 years etc. depending on the present volume of traffic and
importance of road.
Deck level of submersible bridge is then arrived at keeping in view two aspects i.e.
(i)
Flood level during which the submersible bridge is to serve as high level bridge.
(ii)
Flood level (with specific return period) during which the structure is over- topped
but depth of water over the deck is safe for vehicular traffic say 200 mm with
number of and duration of interruptions to traffic not exceeding the permissible
values.
In absence of any other guidelines following criteria may be adopted;
(i)
Number and duration of interruptions to traffic may be reckoned from the flood
level 200 mm above RTL/deck level.
(ii)
In case of submersible bridge, level of deck may be fixed so that the structure
serves as a high level bridge during OFL but to be over topped during higher floods.
(iii)
The deck level ofthe submersible bridge should not be higher than RTL ofapproaches
likely to be submerged during floods, otherwise the approaches may be breached
resulting in major portion of flow to pass through breaches in place of the main
structure, change ofcourse of active channel, extensive recurring maintenance/ repair
costs etc.
(iv)
RTL/deck level should be as low as possible in order to have economical design.
RTL in case of flush causeways/fords may be kept at bed level and may follow the
cross-section ofthe channel to the extent possible
(v)
RTL in case ofvented causeways may be kept keeping in view the minimum vertical
size of vent as
1 000 mm preferably
1 200 mm for proper maintenance, minimum
heading up ofwater of500 mm to generate velocity and minimum concrete cushion
of 300 mm over hume pipes. The height of vented causeways may be restricted to
3 m above the deepest bed level
(vi)
Area of vents in case of vented causeways and waterway of submersible bridge
may be worked out as per procedure explained in Chapter 5 of these guidelines.
7.5.
Design Procedure for Causeways
A design procedure and a worked out example of vented causeway is given in Appendix
7.2. Fig. 7.1 shows cross-section of a typical vented causeway.

7.6.
Length of Submersible Structure
Length of a submersible structure is dependent on the water spread at design flood level
based on return period and percentages of total discharge, which are expected to pass through the
structure and over the approaches without damaging the structure or appurtenances. Therefore,
economical length of a submersible structure is the length, which will be able to pass the maximum
flows that are expected without endangering the structure and appurtenances by scour, without
creating major maintenance problems, without causing unacceptable backwater effects upstream
or affecting the legitimate interests of the local people to unacceptable limits. The length should
also be able to pass through likely quantities ofdebris or logs or rolling boulders without endangering
the structure or other property/locals as a result of accumulation.
Smaller length of the structure with less initial cost generally requires extensive protection/
training works in addition to increased recurring cost of maintenance and repairs and as such may
not be economical for all situations even with protection works. It is, therefore, always advisable
that bridge engineer strikes a balance between the cost of the structure and protection/training
works on the one hand and the expected recurring cost of maintenance on the other hand.
Following criteria may be adopted while selecting the length of the submersible structure;
(i)
The length of submersible structure across a watercourse with regular path should
normally be neither less than water spread at designed flood level (which is based
on return period) plus 2 m.
(ii)
The deck level of the structure should be as low as possible in order to have
economical design of substructure and foundations.
(iii)
Abutments should not be located in active channel of the watercourse.
(iv)
Afflux at HFL (with return period of 50 years) is not abnormally high and unacceptable
from environmental considerations or endangering the safety ofpeople or properties.
7.7.
Span Arrangement
7.7.1. As any obstruction to free flow ofwater in a watercourse affects the flow pattern,
the number of piers (intermediate supports) should be as small as possible because these cause
obstruction to the flow. In other words, the arrangement selected should have minimum number of
spans. This would have the added advantage of lesser number of expansion joints and bearings.
7.7.2.
Single span structure, if feasible should be preferred especially in mountainous
regions, where torrential velocities prevail. Single span arrangement avoids construction of piers
and its foundations in the middle of the watercourse (stream) where the water is the deepest. This
also alleviates the chances ofwashing away of partly constructed foundations and substructure in
case ofwatercourses of flashy nature. However, while this approach eliminates the cost of piers
and its foundations, it requires a stronger superstructure of bigger span and the total cost of the
project may remain unaltered.
7.7.3.
From economic and aesthetic point ofview, the proposed structure should preferably
have odd number of spans (1 ,3,5 etc.) of equal length. Such an arrangement avoids construction of
103



======================================================================
PAGE 114 of 162
======================================================================
lRC:SP:82-2008
pier foundations in the middle ofthe active channel ofthe watercourse having maximum depth of
water, higher velocity of flow and thus reduces the cost of substructure and foundations.
7.7.4.
Span/vent arrangement should be evenly distributed in the active channel portion to
ensure that it does not cause the water to flow parallel to the carriageway i.e. along the approaches
under normal conditions of flow.
7.7.5. When vents are concentrated at the central portion of causeway, heavy scouring
occurs on the sides due to high velocity jets reaching on still water region. Therefore, the vents
should be uniformly distributed all along the length of Causeway. In the case ofcircular vents the
clear spacing between the vents should be atleast half the diameter of the vents.
7.7.6.
In the case of submersible structures (except for major bridges), the usual practice
is to adopt multiple span arrangements with small span lengths of equal length involving simple
design, repetitive operations, maximum utilization of local resources, easy in construction and
rectifications/ modifications during execution stage. Such arrangements generally do not cause
major time/cost overrun. However, depending on site conditions, span arrangements with varying
span lengths, may prove more economical.
7.8.
Span Length
7.8.1.
Selection of span length depends on the materials to be used in substructure and
capacity of the founding strata to carry the loads and forces likely to be transferred from the
substructure and superstructure.
7.8.2. From the point of view of proper maintenance, length of span (even in case of
vented causeways) should preferably not be less than 1.5 m and internal diameter ofhume pipe not
less than 1000 mm, preferably 1200 mm.
7.8.3.
In the case of submersible structures with raft foundations or isolated open
foundations with founding level not deeper than say 4 m below the anticipated maximum scour
level (i.e. top ofbed protection for a majority of submersible structures) and solid wall type piers,
economical designs would generally be given by the following expressions:
(i)
Masonry arch structures
Span = 2 x total height of substructure (upto introdos of the key stone) from bottom
of its foundation in metres.
(ii)
Reinforced Cement Concrete slab structures
Span =
1 .5 x total height of substructure from bottom of its foundation in metres.
(iii)
Typical arch span arrangement of submersible bridge is shown in Fig. 7.4.
7.8.4. Some typical span arrangements and cross-sections successfully adopted in the
past for submersible structures, are shown in Figs. 7.2 to 7.7.

Types of Superstructure
7.9.1. The type of superstructure to be adopted should be selected keeping in view the
economics, aesthetics and client's requirements. Each type has limitations with respect to economy,
requirement of special type ofmachinery/technology/supervision. Since the main consideration in
adoption of submersible structures in place ofhigh level structures is initial low cost, it is necessary
to adopt the most suitable and economical type of superstructure for submersible structures.
110



======================================================================
PAGE 121 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
7.9.2. Executing agencies (Contractors) generally prefer the type with minimum construction
time, not requiring specialized skilled labour and supervision.
7.9.3.
Slender sections with complicated formworks requiring special precautions/
supervision for proper compaction of concrete or involving stage concreting or which are likely to
be displaced during floods or cause higher hydrodynamic forces on substructure and foundations
should be avoided.
7.9.4.
In the case of structures in mountainous reaches, cast in-situ construction may pose
some problems due to high velocity of stream and as such, arrangement with beams cast in casting
yard at site and launched in position may be more appropriate.
7.9.5.
Vent size ofthe arrangement should not be less than 1.50m (horizontal) and
1 .20 m
(vertical) for proper maintenance.
7.9.6.
For major bridges over rivers with high velocities during floods or meandering
nature, it is advisable that the shape and type of superstructure is selected based on the model
studies for the proposed site.
7.9.7.
Balanced cantilever, suspended span or light/steel truss type superstructure are
unsuitable for submersible bridges and should not be provided.
7.9.8.
Integral bridges viz framed structures, arches, multi-cell box structures should be
preferred for submersible structures.
7.9.9.
In order to reduce water current forces on the superstructure and turbulence, aerofoil
type cross section of the superstructure should be adopted.
7.9. 10. Different types of superstructures with suggested span range suitable for submersible
structures are shown in Table 7.1 for ready reference and guidance.

Piers and Abutments

Location of piers in the middle of active channel and abutments in active channel should be
avoided.

======================================================================
PAGE 123 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
Size of substructure (piers and abutments) and foundations depends on the material used,
capacity of the founding strata and height of deck from foundation level. Therefore, the piers/
abutments should be as short as possible with maximum possible span for a site.
7.10.2. Piers
Solid wall type piers are very common being simpler in design and construction. This type
is economical for smaller heights up to 4.0 m and most suitable for watercourses with or without
floating debris. Single column or multicolumn arrangements connected by diaphragm walls are
economical for watercourses requiring higher substructure. However ifthe stream carries floating
debris the diaphragm walls connecting the columns would have to be of full height so as to avoid
the possibility ofthe debris getting entangled between the columns.
Hollow type piers though economical for larger heights, require complicated form work,
closely spaced reinforcement cage and precautions during concreting for proper compaction, are
not recommended for submersible structures over watercourses of high velocity, carrying large
amounts of debris, floating big size stones etc.
Piers should be provided at both ends (upstream and downstream sides) with suitably
shaped cut and ease waters extending upto full height.
7.10.3. Abutments
Open or spill through abutments though economical, are not recommended for adoption
for submersible structures.
Solid wall type abutments are most common because of easy construction and simple
formwork and are economical for small heights say up to 4.0 m.
For larger heights either box or counter-fort type are economical. The only disadvantage in
both types is complicated formwork and more construction time when compared with solid wall
type abutments. Box type also provides opportunity to design engineers to reduce the length of
cantilever return wall.
Abutments of submersible bridges should be designed as abutment piers so that ifrequired,
the same could be converted to the similar shape as pier at a later date.
Abutments should preferably be located in banks to avoid embankment for approaches.
In case it is not possible at a particular site, it is necessary to provide straight return walls in full
length ofembankments (anchoring in banks). Alternatively, embankment of approaches likely to
be submerged during floods should be provided with suitably designed protection work i.e. side
pitching and toe wall/flexible apron as per the provisions of IRC: 89 applicable for spurs to avoid
excessive damages/washing away/ maintenance cost.

7.11. Structural Aspects
7.11.1. Design live loads
The design live loads for submersible bridge should be in accordance with relevant provisions
of IRC: 6, depending on the width of carriageway.
7.11.2. Forces
7.11.2.1. Adequacy/stability ofthe structures needs to be investigated for critical condition.
Generally the critical condition for a?submersible structure is when the affluxed flood level on
upstream side of superstructure is just at the deck level or RTL, and there is a trough of standing
wave on the downstream side due to high velocity through vents.
7.11.2.2, Following pressures may be considered at the critical condition:
(a)
Pressure due to static head due to afflux on upstream side and trough of
standing wave on downstream side:
The pressure due to static head can be calculated as follows:
The pressure due to static head will be zero at the surface of water and will increase
linearly to P, = w h at depth 'h' from the surface, below which it will be constant as
indicated in the sketch below.

7.11.2.3. The sum total of all the horizontal forces may be taken as acting at the top ofthe
pier to test the stability of the structure against overturning.
7.11.3. Combination of loads and forces and additional design considerations
7.11.3.1. All load combinations as specified in IRC:6 should be investigated under the
following flood conditions:
(a)
Flood level just clear of soffit of the superstructure when the structure is to
serve as high level bridge
(b)
Flood level at deck level
(c)
HFL
(d)
LWL (for design of abutments only)
7.11.3.2. Structural adequacy of substructure and foundations should be investigated for
all combinations as specified in Clause 706 of IRC:78.
7.11.3.3. In case of pre-stressed and arch type super structure, effect of buoyancy should
also be considered while working out stresses likely to develop in the superstructure during flood
conditions.
7.11.3.4. Additional load of 1 50 mm thick silt with density equal to
1 5 kN/m
3 spread over
the entire soffit (in case ofbox girders) and deck slabs of all types of superstructure should also be
considered.
7.11.3.5. In absence ofmodel studies, horizontal forces due to water currents on submerged
superstructure as per Clause 213 of IRC: 6 should be based on the value of 'K' as
1.5. for
superstructure.
7.11.3.6. Effects ofbuoyancy should be considered in the design of abutments assuming
that the fill behind abutment has been removed by scour (with scour all around)
7.11.3.7. Relief due to vent holes provided in deck slab/T beam girders/soffit slab ofbox
cell type superstructure and in spandrels of arch'structure should be ignored.
7.11.3.8. Restraining devices/stoppers should be designed to cater for the entire horizontal
forces due to water currents, wind and seismic effects as per the load combination given in IRC:78
ignoring friction.
7.12.
Other Design Precautions
7.12.1.
Structural members should be designed for severe conditions of exposure.
7.12.2. Anchor rods of stainless steel bolts should be provided between the deck slab and
the Piers/abutments to prevent uplift of the deck.
7.12.3. Properly designed stoppers as per para 7. 11.3.8 above shall be provided on pier/
abutment caps to avoid sliding of superstructure in transverse direction.

IRC:SP:82-2008
7.12.4. Superstructure and substructure should be given stream line shape on upstream
and. downstream side.
7.12.5. Sufficient number of vent holes of 1 00 mm diameter, minimum three numbers per
span or at a spacing of 3 m in the longitudinal direction, should be provided in the deck and soffit
slabs and webs ofT-beam/box type superstructure to improve stability during floods. Vent holes of
1 00 mm diameter spacing not exceeding 3 m centre to centre in horizontal direction and
1 m centre
to centre in vertical direction should be provided in the spandrels of arch bridge.
7.13.
Bearings
7.13.1. General: Bearings are vital components of a bridge since these allow longitudinal
and/or transverse rotations and/or movement of superstructure with respect to the substructure
(thus relieving stresses due to expansion, contraction and rotation) and effectively transfer loads
and forces from superstructure to substructure. Adequate care should therefore, be exercised in
selection ofthe right type of bearings for submersible bridges based on the following guidelines:
(i)
Solid Slab Superstructure with span length upto
1 0 m may generally be proposed
to rest directly on unyielding supports (pier/abutment caps) without any bearings.
(ii)
Metallic bearings (mild/cast steel) are not suitable for submersible structures which
are subjected to severe conditions ofexposure during floods and should be avoided.
(iii)
R.C.C. bearings, though adopted in past involve complicated detailing of
reinforcement, formwork, more construction time, special precaution/supervision
for proper compaction of concrete and are difficult to repair/replace if required at
a later date and as such should be avoided.
(iv)
Copper alloy bearings with copper, tin and lead in 70:5:25 ratio with proper
anchorage system may be considered for spans between 10 m to 20 m.
(v)
Elastomeric bearings with central anchorage may be considered for span range of
10 m to 30 m.
(vi)
PTFE bearings with stainless steel components and with galvanised anchorage may
be considered for longer spans than 25 m.
(vii)
Minimum 3 number ofbearings should be provided at each end ofthe superstructure
from stability considerations.
7.13.2. The design of elastomeric and PTFE bearings should be in conformity with
IRC
: 83 Part II and III respectively.
7.13.3. In order to cater for any possible relative longitudinal undue movement of bearings
over the abutment resulting in superstructure ends jamming against the dirt wall, a larger gap may
be provided between the superstructure end and the dirt wall.
7.13.4. All bearing assemblies should be installed in accordance with the instructions
contained in IRC codes and specifications and shown on the approved drawings. In particular the
117



======================================================================
PAGE 128 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
following important points should not be lost sight of:
(i)
All bearings should be set truly level so as to have full and even seating. Thin
mortar pads (not exceeding 12 mm) may be used to meet this requirement.
(ii)
The bottoms of girders resting on the bearing should be plane and truly horizontal.
(iii)
For elastomeric bearing pad, the concrete surface should be level such that the
variation is not more than
1 .5 mm from a straight edge placed in any direction
across the area.
(iv)
For spans in grade, the bearings should be placed horizontal by using tapered sole
plates or suitably designed R.C.C. pedestals.
(v)
Placing of bearings of different sizes next to each other to support a span should be
avoided.
(vi)
Installation of multiple bearings one behind the other for a single line of support
should not be permitted.
(vii)
The bearings should be so protected while concreting the deck in situ, so that there
is no flow of mortar or any other extraneous matter into the bearing assembly and
particularly on to the bearing surfaces. The protection should be such that it can be
dismantled after the construction is over without disturbing the bearing assembly.
(viii)
Special attention should be given to the temporary fixtures to be provided for the
bearings during the concreting of superstructure in order to ensure that the bearings
do not get displaced during the initial installation itself. The temporary fixtures
should be removed as soon as the superstructure has attained its required strength.
(ix)
Bearings provided at any end of superstructure should be along a single line of
support and of identical dimensions.
7.14.
Expansion Joints
7.14.L General: The primary requirement ofan expansion joint is that it should be capable
of accommodating all movements of the deck viz. .translation and rotation and in the process; it
must not cause unacceptable stresses either in the joint itself or in the structure by way of restraint
and impact. The replacement ofan expansionjoint always involves traffic interruption. Therefore,
expansion joints should be robust, suitable for all loads and local actions under all weather conditions
and durable, specially for submerged conditions. The replacement of all wearing parts should be
possible in a simple way.
In general, the expansion joints should perform the following basic
functions:
(i)
Should permit the expansion/contraction ofthe span/spans to which it is fixed without
causing any distress or vibration to the structure.
(ii)
Cause no inconvenience/hazard to the road user and offer good riding comfort.
(iii)
Should be capable of withstanding the traffic loads including dynamic effects.
(iv)
Be watertight and be capable ofexpelling debris without clogging/without imparting
higher force on the structure than what it is designed for. For this, it is desirable to
118



======================================================================
PAGE 129 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
have expansion joint extending for full width including the kerb as well as in footpath
portion. However, specifications ofjoints provided in footpath and kerb may be
different than that provided in the main carriageway portion.
(v)
Surface exposed to traffic should be skid free and resistant to polishing.
(vi)
Ensure accessibility for inspections and easy maintenance with all parts vulnerable
to wear being easily replaceable.
7.14.2. Expansion joints should be designed as per provisions of IRC:SP:69 and steel
components glavanized prior to installation.
7.14.3. No joint is needed for a movement upto 6 mm as such open joint with appropriate
edge/nose protection and joint filer may be considered.
7.14.4.
Filler joints are suitable for movements upto 10 mm or a span of 10 m. The
components of this type ofjoint are corrugated copper plate (minimum 2 mm thick), 20 mm thick
compressible fiber board to protect the edges, 20 mm thick pre-moulded joint filler and joint
sealing compound.
7.14.5. Compression seal joint consisting of galvanized steel armoured nosing at two
edges of the joints gap, suitably .anchored to the deck concrete and a pre-formed chloroprene
elastomer/ closed cell foam joint sealer, compressed and fixed into the joint gap with special adhesive
binder may be considered for movements upto 40 mm.
7.15.
Wearing Coat
Unless otherwise specified, 75 mm thick R.C.C. wearing coat (not monolithic with deck
slab) in concrete grade of minimum M 30 and water cement ratio not exceeding 0.4 should be
considered for submersible structures. The reinforcements placed at the middle depth ofthe wearing
coat may consist of 8 mm diameter bars @ 200 mm centres reducing to
1 00 mm centers in both
directions over a strip of 300 mm near the expansion joint.
7.16.
Material Specifications
7.16.1. Materials used in construction of submersible structures shall conform to relevant
IRC Codes.
7.16.2. In view of the likelihood of the structure getting submerged during floods, the
following additional criteria may also be considered for adoption;
(i)
Minimum strength of concrete, cement contends (kg/cum) and maximum water
cement ratio should be as suggested in Table 7.2.

size aggregates,
it may be reduced suitably but the reduction should not be more than 10 per cent or
30 kg per cu.m whichever is lower. For 12.5 or 10 mm size aggregates,
it shall be increased suitably
but the increment should not be less than 10 per cent or 40 kg per cu.m whichever is higher.
(ii)
Hand mixed concrete shall be avoided but if unavoidable for small isolated causeways, the cement
content shall be increased by 10 per cent.
(iii)
Leveling course for masonry abutment, pier, return/wing/toe wall should be Ml 5.
(iv)
Concrete for piers should not be leaner than M30.
7.16.3. Brick/stone masonry work should be in not leaner than cement mortar of 1 :3.
7.16.4. Annular space around foundations in rock should be filled with cement concrete of
minimum grade ofM 1 5
.
7.16.5. Use ofthermo-mechanically treated (T.M.T.) bars conforming to IS:
1 786 should
be preferred.
7.16.6. In case of streams carrying abrasive particles and velocity higher than 4 m/sec, the
substructure should be provided with an additional sacrificial cover and richer concrete.

presented in the report are listed below for ready reference and guidance.
I.
Maps, plans and topographical features
(i)
An index map (toposheets in scale one cm to 500 m or
1 /50,000) should show the north
line, location ofthe project area, name of district and state, possible sites for submersible
structure along with alignments of approaches, overall road network, nearby important
towns/ villages, structures on the watercourse in the vicinity, some landmarks for easy
identification during reconnaissance etc.
(ii)
A contour survey plan of the watercourse showing topographical features and extending
u/s and d/s ofthe sites for submersible structure considered and also most suitable site for
high level bridge (to be constructed later on). The distances to which the contour plan

order to assess the basic parameters of discharge etc. In case the catchment area of the
watercourse is restricted area, the concerned department should make efforts to obtain
the toposheets for the project. The scale and size to be .used in the catchment area map
depends on size, nature and needs ofeach submersible structure. The catchment area of
a submersible structure should be identified and marked clearly on the topographical
map. The identified catchment should also include the contour, slope both in longitudinal
and cross directions, existing land use pattern like forests, cultivated land, barren land,
desert, natural and artificial storage areas etc., to the extent possible.

Three numbers of cross-sections (one at the proposed site for the submersible structure
and one each at u/s and d/s of the proposed site) are generally sufficient to yield necessary
data for the design of waterway, length of the structure
, location of piers/ abutments,
deck level for the proposed structure and height of immediate approach embankment. In
case an existing road or cart track crosses the watercourse at the site selected for the
submersible structure, the cross section should not be taken along the centerline of the
road/track as the same will not represent the natural shape and size ofthe watercourse. In
such cases, the cross section should be taken at a short distance on the d/s of the selected
site.

(c)
Bed levels at suitable intervals and

Hydraulic data and watercourse characteristics
The basic purpose of collecting hydrological data is to study the rain fall pattern like
intensity, duration, frequency and run-off characteristics ofthe basin under consideration
and thereby assess the likely discharge through the watercourse.
Hydraulic data collected for the purpose of the preliminary project report (PPR) has to
be good enough for the detailed engineering also. No separate hydraulic data collection
is envisaged for detailed engineering except that for model studies, if any conducted for
123



======================================================================
PAGE 134 of 162
======================================================================
IRC:SP:82-2008
structures across large rivers. The hydraulic data collected should include:
(i)
Catchment area map, cross-sections and longitudinal section prepared as per sub-
paras (iv) to (vi) of I above respectively;
(ii)
HFL ascertained from watermarks if any on the permanent objects on the banks
supplemented by local enquiry from nearby inhabitants as to the highest flood
levels reached during their living memory;
(iii)
OFL and LWL ascertained with reference to watermarks if any on the permanent
objects on the banks supplemented by local enquiry from nearby inhabitants;
(iv)
Velocity offlow and presence of floating debris etc., during floods from local enquiry.
Velocity of flow should preferably be ascertained during floods by the use of floats
by determining the time to traverse two fixed points at measured distance apart;
(v)
In case a causeway or the existing bridge is of insufficient waterway resulting in
afflux, the extent of such afflux be ascertained for arriving at the rough assessment
of discharge;
(vi)
Names and approximate discharges of all tributaries joining the river within a
reasonable distance u/s of the site under consideration;.
(vii)
Skew angle of crossing, if any, should be ascertained correctly. Skew angle should
be measured in relation to the direction of flow at/near designed flood level (i.e.
OFL ) and not in relation to the bank line.
(viii)
Rainfall data indicating
(a)
Maximum precipitation in one hour and 24 hours
(b)
Rainfall distribution in catchment
(c)
Duration and frequency of floods
(d)
Rain gauge data of storms for which corresponding watercourse gauge data is
available (data for unit hydrograph)
(e)
- Average annual rainfall characteristics supported with relevant meteorological
records.
III.
Watercourse/channel/river characteristics:
(i)
All details of configuration ofthe watercourse as may be relevant to hydrological analysis
(given below for ready reference) may be obtained from ground survey. All controls,
natural (drops, rapids, bends, debris) and artificial (dams/ weirs /spurs and bridges etc.)
should be identified and effect on the discharge at the site should be assessed. Degradation
of the watercourse channel may invite higher flood discharge whereas aggradation may
result in higher flood levels and bank spills. These factors have direct bearing on design of
waterway clearances and approaches and structure.
(a)
Seasonal or perennial
(b)
Braided, meandering or straight
(c)
Other classifications like bouldery, flashy, well defined, presence ofpools, weeds
etc.
(d)
Conditions ofbanks i.e. erodible or non-erodible, high or low or flat, khadir width
(e)
Sediment load aggradation or degradation behaviour.

Flood flow data
A reliable and correct collection of flood data forms the basis of decision about the type
of structure (i.e. high level or low level structure), deck level ofthe structure and height of
embankments etc. Historical and flood data records maintained by the irrigation or other
authority helps in arriving at a realistic assessment of likely discharge, frequency, HFL,
OFL influence of afflux on project areas etc.
Data regarding existing bridge structures:
Data regarding flood records, scour observations, waterway, functioning of the existing
bridges on the same stream in the vicinity of the proposed site helps in fixation of design
data, identification ofadditional data required to be collected and planning ofthe project
in a systematic manner. The data should include the following:
(a)
Description with sketches showing relevant dimensions or general arrangement
drawing.(GAD) indicating the salient hydraulic data;
(b)
Observed HFL, OFL ascertained from records or marks on substructure;
(c)
Length and depth of submergence, number and sizes of vents, and frequency
(including duration) of interruptions to traffic in case of causeways/ submersible
structures;
(d)
Number and length of spans, clear waterway, adequacy of otherwise of waterway
with special reference to silted up spans or signs of unde scour or attacks on
abutments and approaches in case of bridges and
(e)
Observed afflux, if any.
Sub-soil data
The main aim of sub-surface exploration (investigations) is to collect sub-soil data in
order to determine the suitability or otherwise of the available soil or rock and the design
parameters for foundations of submersible structure. The sub-surface investigations are
carried out in two stages, i.e. preliminary and detailed. However, in case of submersible
structures with multiple (more than two) spans ofmore than
1 5 m or well/pile foundations
or availability of suitable foundation strata at varying depth below bed level with abrupt
changes in thickness, additional/confirmatory explorations is carried out. The main objective
of additional exploration during execution is to confirm the characteristics of sub-soil
materials established during detailed exploration, based on which design was made and
to affect suitable modifications to suit the conditions met at specific foundation locations.
All in-situ tests should invariably be supplemented by laboratory investigations. Guidance
for subsoil investigation may be taken from the Standards listed below:
IS:1498,IS:1888,IS:1892,IS:2131,IS:2132,IS:2720
IS:4434, IS:4968 (Parts

(Reference: Para 7.5)
DESIGN PROCEDURE AND WORKED OUT EXAMPLE FOR A
TYPICAL VENTED CAUSEWAY
A simple approach for designing typical vented causeways is given below for the guidance
ofnew Engineers.
I.
Important components of a vented causeway are vents, bed protection, raised face walls
and paved road surface, which together ensure stability and prevent outflanking. The
flow conditions are analyzed with reference to top ofthe protected bed and ifthe percentage
obstruction to flow at the Road Top Level (RTL)/deck level is kept below 60% and at the
most 70%, then normally no outflanking would take place. At flood levels higher than the
road top level, the percentage obstruction goes on reducing and the structure will be safe.
The critical conditions for design are:
(i)
When the flow is at RTL
(ii)
When the flow is at HFL
II.
Step by step procedure:
(i)
Collect normal hydraulic data, such as, catchment area, annual rainfall, HFL, site plan, L-
section, tide level, etc.
(ii)
Collect hourly/ daily record of flood levels for a representative monsoon period and plot
it on a graph as explained in para 5. 1 .2 ofChapter 5. However, if decided by the competent
authority, this step may be skipped in the case of less important crossings with length of
causeway less say 30 m.
(iii)
Plot defined cross-section in the vicinity of proposed site to a natural scale.
(iv)
Plot cross-section of crossing at proposed location to the natural scale showing soil
conditions.
(vj
With the help ofthe graph (ii) above, determine the lowest required Road Top Level so as
to satisfy the requirements of frequency and duration of submergence indicated in
Table 3.1 of Chapter 3.
(vi)
Fix Road Top Level (RTL) keeping in view following guidelines: -
(a)
It should be as low as possible but higher than the lowest RTL determined vide step
(v) above.
(b)
In case of box or simply supported slab/arch type structures, the vent size should
not be less than
1 .5 m horizontal and
1 .2 m vertical. Internal diameter of circular
corrugated/RCC hume pipe should not be less than
1 .0 m or
1 .2 m preferably.
(c)
Cushion over the structures should not be less than thickness of proposed road
pavement subject to minimum 300 mm.

(d)
Sill level of vents should be 300 mm below the lowest bed level (LBL) with
longitudinal slope (in the direction of flow) nearly same as that of stream bed subject
to minimum of 1
: 1 00.
(e)
The Protected Bed Level (PBL) may be kept equal to the sill level of vents.
(vii)
In the case of less important crossings, if it is decided by the competent authority to skip
fixing ofthe lowest required Road Top Level as per rigorous method vide step (v) above,
for first trial a level difference of say 1.5 m may be assumed between RTL and PBL.
(viii)
Transfer RTL fixed as above to the defined cross-section as first trial.
(ix)
Calculate area below RTL at the defined cross-section.
(x)
Fix vent area i.e. about 40% but minimum 30 percent, in normal rain fall areas and minimum
20% in case of scanty rainfall areas.
(xi)
Determine number of pipes/ number of spans and span length of vents.
(xii)
Fix length of horizontal portion ofthe face wall and length of rising face wall keeping in
view following guidelines:
(a)
Length of horizontal portion should be equal to bed width of the channel plus
minimum 4m.
(b)
Gradient of rising face wall should be between
1
: 1 5 to
1 :30.
(xiii)
Calculate the unobstructed natural area of flow at the defined cross section between the
bed level and the proposed RTL
=
A,
(xiv)
Calculate the area of flow available at vented causeway upto protected bed
=
A
2
(xv)
The percentage obstruction to flood water is calculated by following expression.
A -A
—
- x 100
A,
(xvi)
If the obstruction is not less than 70 per cent, then steps are repeated by increasing the
RTL by 200 mm.
(xvii)
The proposal, with percentage obstruction less than 70 per cent is then finalized.
(xviii)
This should be checked for flood level at design flood level, for which condition the
percentage obstruction should be less than 30%.

Percentage of the area of flow below RTL=
1 00x1 3 .345/36. 1 5= 36.92%.
This is a little less than 40% but is more than the minimum of30%. Hence O.K.
Check for obstruction when flood level is at HFL
Assume an approach gradient of 1 :30 on either side.
Width of stream at HFL = 34+2x 30 (102.42-100.5) = 149.2 m.
Area available for flow above RTL = [(149.2 +34)/2] x 1. 92 = 175.872 sq. m.
Therefore total available area for flow = 175.872 + 13.345 = 189.217 sq. m.
Area of obstruction = 34 (100.5 - 98.605) - 13.345 = 51.085 sq. m.
Percentage obstruction = 51,085/ 189.217 x 100 = 27 %
Less than 30%. Hence O.K.

8. APPROACHES, PROTECTION WORK AND APPURTENANCES
8.1.
Approaches
8.1.1. General
(i)
The approach roads to Causeways/ Submersible Bridge should preferably be in
cutting with the approach gradient not steeper than 1 in 30. The sloping portion of
the approach should merge into level portion ofthe causeway in the arc ofa properly
deigned vertical curve in order to eliminate bumping as illustrated in Fig. 8.1.
Similarly wherever there is a change of grades, it is desirable to provide properly
designed vertical curve at the junction of the two grades from considerations of
user's comfort.
(ii)
It is preferable to have the approaches in cutting as the embankments are liable to
be washed away during floods. In cutting, however, there may be the problem of
silting but the same can be appreciably reduced ifthe approaches are aligned at a
slight angle to the center line ofthe bridge so that the gradient falls in the direction
of the river flow. This, however, may result in sharp curves in the approaches.
Straight approaches are always preferable from the point ofview of traffic and also
ease in construction ofwing wall and in actual practice the amount of silting in a
well designed submersible bridge with straight approaches may not be excessive.
The sides of cutting should be protected by stone revetment upto at least
1 m
above the affluxed H.F.L. This would avoid scouring of the sides of cutting and
consequent silting ofthe approaches.
(iii)
The approaches in cutting would get submerged for a considerable period therefore
these should be provided with safe side slopes considering the submerged condition.
Further, deep cutting (say more than 4 m) should invariably be avoided. Wherever
steep side slopes are provided for the approaches in cutting it is experienced that
the slopes slip over the road pavement and it becomes a recurring problem to clear
it, after every flood. The values of safe side slopes for the different types of soil
under submerged condition are given in Table 8.1 for reference and guidance:

(v)
Lined drains on either side along the side slopes should be provided. The lining
may be either stone or brick or concrete. The side drains should meet the stream
proper atleast 10m away from the edge ofthe main causeway junction as the flow
of water in the drains would erode the banks for certain length in course of time
Fig. 8.2. In case of straight return walls, minimum 3 m long walls perpendicular to
the return walls should be provided to avoid undermining of foundations of return
wall or/and abutments.

(vi)
In case of submersible bridges founded on sandy beds, extraction of sand/soft
material beyond apron and curtain wall should not be done as this may endanger
the safety of the structure.
8.1.2. Pavement for approaches
(i)
Length of approaches upto the spread of affluxed highest flood is subjected to
repeated inundation and is always prone to out flanking. Therefore the roadway
should be paved in a similar manner to that of the main causeway/submersible
Bridge. The paved approach roadway in cutting needs to be confined between
anchor-walls as shown in Fig. 8.3. In case the approach road is not in cutting than
unidirectional camber (d/s side) should be provided.
(ii)
Length of the remaining approach roads in cutting, beyond spread of the affluxed
highest flood, may be constructed with the usual type ofpavement with the exception
that the metalled surface should be provided for the full width of the roadway. In
case of soft soils banks it is preferable to provide this with the anchor walls and
side drains Fig. 8.3.
(iii)
Composition ofPavement
Following minimum pavement composition for approaches to causeways may be
adopted unless otherwise required from design consideration.
(a)
200 mm thick compacted mooram/gravel/crushed stones;
(b)
1 50 mm thick water bound macadam; and
(c)
200 mm thick cement concrete slab ofM30 grade.
8.1.3. Face walls/cut-off walls for causeways
(i)
A substantial portion of the flood water has to pass over these face walls/ cut-off
walls, therefore these walls should be taken down to safe depth and their structure
should be strong enough to avoid damages during floods.
(ii)
In order to ensure as streamed lined flow as possible and there by restrict the
velocities and turbulence on the D/S side to desirable limits and to avoid out-flanking,
the elevational profile adopted for these walls should be as close as possible to that
of the natural hyperbolic cross section of the watercourse. However, in road
geometry it may be difficult to adopt such a section, therefore a modified shape in
form of trapezoid may be adopted. This is achieved by keeping the central portion
of the walls at one level and raising their levels in the flank portions as shown in
Fig. 8.4.
(iii)
It is desirable to provide length ofthe level portion of face wall equal to width ofthe
stream at RTL + 2 to 5 m on either side. Similarly the total length of face wall will be
equal the width of the stream at OFL + 2 to 5 m. It will be provided for full height
of the approaches on either side.

(iv)
The foundation ofthe level portion and
1 to 2 m raised portion of either side of face
wall should be taken sufficiently deep to avoid exposure due to scouring as shown
in Fig. 8.4.
(v)
For the structural stability and better hydraulic performance, it is desirable that
batter of face walls should be provided on the outside faces.
8.2.
Protection Work
(i)
If it becomes necessary to provide the approaches in embankment than proper
protection of approaches is to be done with stone pitching etc. Full width of the
roadway of approaches likely to be submerged should be paved. Typical cross-
sectional details of approaches are shown in Fig. 8.5 (a), (b) and (c).
8.2.1.
Anchorages and thrust-blocks for submersible-structures
In order to resist the water current forces in the form of drag and uplift forces it is advisable
to anchor the deck slabs with pier/abutment caps in case ofvented causeways/submersible bridges.
(i)
For solid deck slabs - Special arrangements, to anchor the deck to the pier/
abutment (with stainless steel anchor rods) against uplift or lateral thrust and at the
same time to allow longitudinal movements due to contraction and expansion because
of temperature effect, are required to be made. Typical details of anchoring and
thrust block are shown in Fig. 8.6(a) and 8.6 (b).
(ii)
For hollow box - girder superstructure: - As a protection measure, the following
arrangements are used to withstand safely the effects of water current forces in
case of hollow box type superstructure;
(a)
For stability against uplift forces acting on hollow boxes superstructure, holding
down Stainless steel anchorages are provided as shown in Fig. 8.7 (a).
(b)
For stability against drag forces, reinforced cement concrete thrust blocks
either alone or in combination with side elastomeric pads are provided over
pier/abutment cap as shown in Fig. 8.7 (b).
8.3.
Appurtenances
Appurtenances have their own value for (i) safety, (ii) aesthetics and architectural point of
view. General detail, guard stones, and railing are given below:
8.3.1. R.C.C. Streamlined guard-stones at
1 .5 m c/c are generally provided on vented
and non-vented causeways (flush causeways). These are discontinuously provided over the deck
& approaches within the zone ofthe affluxed HFL and should be cast monolithically with slab over
headwalls so as to form a firm grip (Fig. 8.8). Dressed stones can also be used as guard stones if
suitable size of stones (say 225 mm x 225 mm x 400 mm) are available.
In the case of other submersible structures, the use of guard stones should be restricted to
the approaches.

8.3.3.2. Collapsible railing: The railings are also of steel section. These can be collapsed
flat when flood level approaches the kerbs. Fig. 8.9 (b) shows the typical details of such type of
railings.
•
8.3.4. Debris arrester
During monsoon particularly during the first couple of rains a lot of debris is carried by
floods. This debris gets obstructed by the piers and the superstructure. This causes damages to
structure and obstruction to flow of water. The phenomenon is more pronounced in the case of
bridges in forest areas where the floods carry a lot of trees and branches. This situation can be
quite dangerous for smaller spans. Generally the banks get out flanked if the structure is strong
enough to withstand water current forces. It is, therefore, desirable to resort to spans ofminimum
8 m or so. This will allow a lot of debris to pass through the bridge. If the spans are smaller in
comparison to the size of debris, debris arresters should be provided on up steam ofthe bridge site
so that there is free flow of floodwater through the bridge. Fig. 8.10 (a) and (b) show typical
details of concrete and steel type debris arresters.
8.3.5. Surge holes and inspection holes
(i)
Surge holes are provided in the deck slab and in the webs of submersible bridges
to relieve uplift under rising flood waters (See Fig. 7.7). However, holes in the
deck slab should be avoided as these would endanger traffic safety and affect the
riding quality of the deck.
(ii)
Such openings are also provided in the bottom slab (soffit) of box sections to
maintain equal level of flood water both inside and outside.
(iii)
Some openings in webs/diaphragms ofbox girder superstructures across large rivers
would also serve the purpose of providing access for inspection. Such openings
should therefore be ofman-hole size. The minimum required area ofall other openings
is calculated considering rise in flood level @ 300 mm per hour.
(iv)
Silt accumulated inside the box type ofsubmersible bridges is to be removed manually
or by water jets at the end of each flood season. The top of the soffit slab of the
box girders may be provided with mild cross slope not exceeding 4% to facilitate
the removal of silt by jets.
8.3.6. Flood gauges
For safety of road users, flood gauges conforming to IRC: 67 at about
1 5 m c/c to indicate
the depth of water over the road surface/deck alongwith danger level should be installed on all
submersible structures and approaches likely to be submerged.
8.3.7. Informatory/warning sign boards
Advance warning/cautionary signs giving information about the proximity ofthe submersible
structure, speed limit, depth ofwater during annual floods, limits ofsubmergence should be installed

either approach of the submersible structure one at about 200 m from the start of submerged
portion of the approach and the other at 50 m from the start of submersible structure. The signs
should contain the following warnings:
(i)
"Slow Down. Submersible Structure 200 m Ahead Speed Limit 15 kmph"
(ii)
"Dead Slow Submersible Structure 50 m Ahead
(iii)
"Do not Cross when Flood Water Overtops the Carriageway"
8.3.8. Rumble Strips alongwith cautionary signs as per IRC:99 shall be provided at 30 m
ahead of the submersible bridge on either approach road.
