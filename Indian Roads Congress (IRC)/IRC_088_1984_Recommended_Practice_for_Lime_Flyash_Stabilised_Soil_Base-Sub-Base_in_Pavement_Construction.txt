RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR LIME FLYASH
STABILISED SOIL BASE/SUB-BASE IN
PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
This
recommended
practice
describes
a
method of
stabilisation
of
soils
by
utilising
flyash
with lime to provide a
base/sub-base
course
in the design
of road pavement.
Flyash
is
a waste
product
available
from
coal or lignite burning thermal
plants.
Flyash can be advantageously used not only in
the
pave-
ment
construction work, but also provides an economic and useful
avenue for disposal of flyash, which
is now recognised as a national
environmental problem.
1.2.
Draft
of
this
Recommended
Practice
was
initially
prepared by T.K. Natarajan and approved by the Soil Engineering
Committee (personnel given below) in their meeting held
at
Ootty
on the 19th September, 198\.

The
draft was
processed and approved
by the Speci-
fications
and
Standards
Committee
at
their
meeting
held
at
New Delhi on the 24th May, 1983 subject to
certain modifications,
which on the authority of the Committee,
were
carried
out
by
a
Working
Group
consisting
of
T.K.
Natarajan,
N.

2.
SCOPE
2.1.
Lime-flyash
mixtures
can be
used for a wide range of
pavement systems such as
sub-bases
and bases for
flexible pave-
ments and bases for rigid pavements. This Recommended Practice
is intended to provide guidelines
for stabilising local soils with lime
and flyash for use as
a
sub-base
in pavement
construction.
It is
pre-supposed
that
the
work
will
be
carried out in accordance
with appropriate construction specifications
and good site supervi-
sion will be exercised as regards the quality of constituent materials
and process of construction.
3.
THICKNESS DESIGN OF LIME FLYASH
SOIL SUB-BASE BASE LAYER
The thickness of
lime-flyash-soil layer for use as sub-base or
base course in pavement construction should be designed in accor-
dance
with IRC
: 37-1984
entitled
'Guidelines
for
the
design of
flexible
pavements'.
However,
the
minimum
thickness of lime-
flyash-soil
layer
should be
15 cm.
The sub-base layer constru-
cted
by
using
lime-flyash
as
the stabilising admixture,
though
semi-rigid
in
character
and behaviour, shall be deemed to be a
flexible
layer for purpose
of
applying CBR
method of design of
thickness.
4.
MATERIALS
4.1.
Soil
Granular
soils
free
from
high
concentrations
of organic
matter or deleterious
salts and sands with fine silts produce better
mixes than
fine
grained soils with high
clay content which would
require a high percentage of lime for stabilisation.
Clayey silts and
low-plasticity
clays
having
PI between 5 and
20 and liquid limit
2



======================================================================

IRC

less than 25 are, however, quite suitable.
For satisfactory stabilisa-
tion
with
lime,
it
is
necessary
for
a
soil
to possess a certain
minimum proportion of clay fraction,
since strength of the
stabili-
sed material
is derived from the reaction
that takes place between
lime
and
clay
particles.
The
minimum proportion of particles
smaller
than
425
micron size, should
be between 15 and 25 per
cent by dry
weight
of the
soil lime flyash mixture.
Selection of
materials
and their
gradation, as far
as possible, should be such
as would
be
conducive
to
compaction
to a high density in the
4.2.
Lime
The lime to be
used for
lime-flyash-soil stabilisation, should
be commercial dry lime
slaked at site or pre-slaked and delivered
to the place of work in a
suitable and
approved packing.
Gene-
rally the lime used should have a
purity (CaO content) of not less
than
50 per
cent when tested in
accordance with IS: 1514.
Only
hydrated high-calcium
and
monohydrated
dolomitic
limes
are
used in
Lime
Flyash
Soil
Stabilisation.
High-calcium-content
varieties of lime give higher
strengths
especially at low concentra-
tions
of
lime.
Quick
lime is not recommended to be used.
In
exceptional
circumstances,
if lime
with
50 per cent purity
is not
conveniently
available,
the
difference
may be accounted for by
providing
proportionately
higher
quantity
of lime.
Since lime
deteriorates
with
storage, the per
cent purity must be checked at
site before use and the quantity to be
added is regulated accordin-
gly.
Lime
when
stored,
should
be
kept in a covered place to
prevent its carbonation.
4.3.
Flyash
Flyash to be used should conform to IS
: 3812-1981.
If it had
been stock-piled for some period
before use
and had got partially
or wholly set,
it should be pulverised and dry sieved before mixing
so
as to conform to the following gradation
:
field.
Sieve size (mm)
Per cent passing
12.5
9.5
2.0
100
95 (minimum)
75 (minimum)

======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 24
======================================================================
IRC
: 88-1984
Flyashes are
pozzolanas with little
cementitious value but in
the presence
of
moisture, react
chemically
with calcium hydro-
oxides at ordinary temperature to form
compounds
with
cementi-
tious properties.
It should be ensured
before use that the flyash
is
reactive to lime.
It should possess
lime reactivity of not less than
35 kg/cm 2
.
In addition to the primary reaction between
lime and
flyash, the lime
may also react
chemically
with the 'fines'
in the
material resulting in
base-exchange,
flocculation and aggregation
of particles.
The
magnitude
of
this
reaction,
apart
from
the
degree of fineness
of the
clay-component of the material, depends
upon its mineralogical characteristics (viz. predominant clay mineral
present
and
its
relative
abundance).
Flyash
should
be
fine
enough
to
have
a
specific
surface
area
of
3200
cm 2/gm or
320 m2 /kg.
Flyash
when stored, should
be kept in a covered place safe
from moisture.
4.4.
Water
Water used
for both mixing and curing
should be clean and
free
from
injurious
salts and
other deleterious matter.
Potable
water
is generally considered satisfactory.
5.
PROPERTIES OF COMPACTED AND CURED
SOIL-LIME-FLYASH MIXTURE
Following
are
some of the significant properties of the com-
pacted
and
cured
lime
flyash-soil mixes which serve as general
guidelines
in the
design of Lime Flyash Soil stabilised
pavement
layers
:
5.1.
In the
case of clayey
soils, addition of lime-flyash may
result in a decrease
of maximum
density and optimum moisture.
For silty soils, optimum mositure may increase slightly.
5.2.
If the soil
is
well-graded
and
it
is thoroughly
mixed
with water, lime and
flyash with adequate
compaction,
it helps
in
attaining
a
higher
compacted
density
and
higher
strength.

======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 24
======================================================================
IRC
: 88-1984
Strength
achieved
at
90
per cent Heavy Compaction density, for
example, may be only 60 per cent of that achieved at 100 per
cent
Heavy Compaction density in some cases.
5.3.
Development of strength of lime-flyash-soil mix depends
on curing
period,
moisture
and
temperature.
It is rather slow
and takes
several years to reach the
peak value.
The higher the
curing
temperature
the
greater
is
the
strength development.
Strength
development
is
substantially
retarded at low tempera-
tures say less them 4°C.
For the pozzolanic
reactions to continue,
the
compaction moisture content (roughly equal to optimum) must
be maintained in the lime
flyash-soii mixture
during
the
curing
period.
In
normal
practice,
a curing
period of 28 days under
moist conditions
should be allowed to the
mix to gain a high per-
centage of ultimate strength.
5.4.
The
average
compressive strength of compacted clay,
well compacted sand-clay, well-compacted gravel-sand-clay would
normally vary from
1 to 7 kg/cm2
. By using lime-flyash-soil admix-
ture, the strength has been found to range as under
:
Clay (admixed with lime flyash and
14 to 34 kg/cm 2
Soils
stabilised
with
lime-flyash
can
give
laboratory
soaked
CBR
values
ranging
between
40
and 90.
The
available data
suggest a roughly
linear
increase
in CBR
values
of
soil
lime
flyash
mixtures when
the proportion of (lime+flyash) is between
10
per
cent and
30
per
cent of the dry weight of the total soil.
The range
of
increase
in
strength
in
terms
of CBR
values
is
however different for different soil types.

extent and duration of mixing the curing moisture temperature and

the strength of the compacted mix.
7.
MIX DESIGN AND PROPORTIONING
7.1.
The mix
with optimum proportion of (lime-i-flyash) to
soil and also ratio by weight of lime to
flyash should first be deci-
ded in
the
laboratory
by trial
and error.
The same should be
adopted
in the field.
The mix
proportion
should be designated
as
:
(a)
The ratio of lime to flyash, and
(b)
The proportions of lime; flyash and soil in the
total mixture expressed in parts by dry weight.
Thus if the ratio
: L
: FA is 1:4: the designation by parts may be
Lime
:
3 parts
Flyash
12 parts
Soil
:
85 parts
Total (cm dry wt. basis)
= 100
7.2.
Experience
suggests that lime-flyash ratios of 1:3 to
1:4
give optimum strength for various soil types suitable for lime-flyash
soil
stabilisation.
Further increase
in lime content does not indi-
cate a proportionate increase in strength.
Lime plus flyash content
ranging
between
10 and 30
per
cent by
weight of the total dry
mixture has been found to be
suitable.
Lime flyash requirements,
in fact, depend upon the percentage of fines in the total mix.
Fine
cohesive silts require a
higher
percentage
of
(lime -f flyash) com-
pared to well-graded
soils.
Strength development
calls for suffi-
cient matrix material (fines) to
fill the voids in coarse materials.
7.3.
The
exact
proportions
of the
ingredients
viz.
lime,
flyash
and soil, to
be adopted at a
particular location should be
based
on
the
laboratory mix design depending upon the strength
requirement.
The minimum unconfined
compressive strength and
CBR
values
after
28 days curing and 4 days soaking
should be
7.5
kg/cm2
and 25 per cent respectively.
In terms of seven days
curing and
four
days soaking, the minimum
unconfined compre-

======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 24
======================================================================
IRC
: 88-1984
ssive
strength
and CBR values
should be
3 kg/cm 2 and 10 per
cent
respectively.
The
curing
may be
done
at a temperature
ranging from 30°C to 38°C.
7.4.
Trial mixes
using
(lime-flyash)
ratios of 1:2,
1:3,
1:4,
are
initially
prepared.
The
following
overall proportions may
accordingly
be
used
for
preparing
the mixtures for laboratory
tests
:

Additional
trials may
be
made
if
required.
Amounts
of
lime
quantity
smaller
than two per cent are generally not amenable to
proper mixing and hence not recommended.
7.5.
Each of the mixes suggested above
shall
be
subjected
to laboratory compaction tests in
accordance
with
the
procedure
laid down
in IS: 2720 (Part VIII) using Heavy Compaction effort.
The values of the maximum Dry Density and Optimum
Moisture
Content (OMC) shall be scaled out from the plot in each case.
7.6.
Either the unconfined compression or the CBR test may
be
employed
for
the determination
of strength of the compacted
soil lime flyash mix depending on the design requirement.
In
the
case

former test, specimens of the mix compacted at OMC
and with the same amount of compaction effort shall be
prepared,
cured
for 28 days at a temperature ranging from 30°C to 38°C and
maintaining constant
moulding
moisture,
and
finally
tested
for
unconfined compressive strength as per IS: 2720 (Part X). The spe-
cimen

Alternatively,
the CBR test
shall
be
carried
out
in
the
same way
by curing samples for 7
days or 28 days, with 4 days soaking as the case may
be
in
acco-
rdance with the provisions of IS:2720 (Part XVI-1965). The results
of
tests
shall
then
be
plotted
using the compressive strength or
CBR and the lime flyash soil
ratios
as
the
two
axes.
The
ratio
corresponding
to the Minimum Strength Requirement as specified
in para 7.3.
will be adopted and the one which suggests minimum
quantity
of lime
or
the
one
which,
according
to
detailed cost
analysis,
works
out
to
be
the
most
economical
shall finally be
selected. Specimen samples using the same proportions,
prepared
in
the same
manner
will
be
tested
for compressive strength or
CBR for verification and confirmation.

CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS
8.1.
Preparation of Subgrade
The
subgrade
or
sub-base
over
which
the lime-flyash-soil
layer
is
to
be
laid
should
be checked for line grade and cross-
section.
All
irregularities
beyond the permitted tolerance should
be
rectified.
The
road
bed
shall
be
prepared by removing all
vegetation and
other
extraneous
matter,
lightly
sprinkled
with
water
if necessary
and
rolled
with
8-10 tonne smooth wheeled
roller.
Soft and
yielding
spots and
ruts,
if
present,
should be
corrected and rolled until firm.
8.2.
Weather Limitations
Lime-flyash-soil stabilization should not be done when the air
temperature in the shade is less than
10°C.
8.3.
Degree of Pulverisation
For
lime-flyash
stabilization,
the soil before addition of sta-
bilizer, shall be pulverised to the extent that it passes
the

Batching and Mixing
After
determining
the
proportions
of
lime, flyash and soil,
batching
of materials
should
be done by weight before the same
are
mixed
together.
Volume
batching may
be
permitted
only
when
it
is
unavoidable.
The
materials
before
being mixed to-
gether shall be thoroughly pulverised.
Pulverisation may be done
either
by
making use of mechanical plants or manually by means
of rotary tillers, disc harrows, crow bars, pick axes, bullock drawn
ploughs, etc.
For mixing one of the two methods can be followed.
Either the soil, lime and flyash can be mixed
together and
spread
on
the
subgrade
or lime and flyash are stacked on the pulverised
soil already spread on the subgrade at suitable distances
and
then
spread and mixed with the soil.
8.5.
Tolerance
Limits
of tolerance,
for
various materials in percentage by
weight are as follows:
Lime
±
0.3
Fly Ash
±
1.5
Soil/Aggregate
±
2.0
8.6.
Plant for Construction
Mix in place method
is found to be convenient for
achieving
consistency than manual mixing. Manual mixing shall be permitted
only when
the
width
of laying
is
not
adequate for mechanical
operations.

Plants
used
for
mix in place
construction
shall be capabie
of pulverising the soil to specified degree and
achieving
the
desi-
red degree of mixing and uniformity of the stabilised material.
For
mix
in
place
method
of construction before deploying
the plant, the soil after
it is made free of undesirable and
deleteri-
ous
matter
shall
be
spread uniformly on the prepared road bed
in a quantity sufficient to achieve the desired compacted
thickness
of the
stabilised layer. When single pass equipment is to be emp-
loyed, the soil shall be rolled lightly.
The
plant used shall either be of single-pass or multiple-pass
type.
The
mixers
shall
be
equipped
with an appropriate device
for controlling the depth of processing and the mixing blades
shall
be
maintained
or
reset
periodically
so
that the correct depth of
mixing is obtained at all times.
With
single-pass
equipment
the
forward
speed
of
the
machine
shall
be
so
selected
in
relation to the rotor speed that
the
required
degree
of
mixing,
pulverization
and depth of pro-
cessing is obtained.
In
multi-pass
processing,
the
soil on the prepared road bed
shall be pulverized to the required depth with successive passes
of
the plant and the moisture content adjusted to be within prescribed
limits.
The
stabilizing
material
shall
then
be spread uniformly
and
mixing
continued initially dry mixing till
it becomes homoge-
nous and then followed by wet mixing with the
addition
of water
in
requisite
quantity, with
successive
passes
until
the
required
depth and uniformity of processing has been obtained.
The mixing plant shall be so set that
it cuts
slightly
into
the
edge
of the
adjoining
lane
processed previously so as to ensure
that all the material forming a layer has been
properly
processed
for the full width.
8.7.
Construction with Manual Means
Where
manual
mixing
is
permitted,
the
soil from borrow
areas shall first be freed
of
all
vegetation and

matter
and
placed on the prepared road bed. The soil shall then
be pulverised by means of crow-bars, pick axes or other
approved
means.
Water
in
requisite quantities may be sprinkled on the soil
for aiding pulverisation. On the
pulverised
soil,
stabilising
mate-
rials)
in
requisite quantities
shall be spread uniformly and mixed
dry
thoroughly
by
working
with
spades or other similar imple-
ments
till
the
whole
mass
is
mixed
uniform
and homogenous.
After
adjusting
the
moisture
content
to
be within the limits, the
mixed
material
shall
be
levelled
upto
the required thickness so
that it is ready to be rolled.
8.8.
For
all
the
three
mehthods
the maximum thickness
of individual
compacted
layer
shall
not
exceed
100 mm.
The
materials
and
their
proportion
shall
be
arranged, keeping
this
requirement in view.
As the minimum thickness of lime flyash soil
layer has been prescribed as 150 mm, the same shall be laid in two
layers. Before laying the second
layer
the
compacted
first
layer
shall be roughened to ensure proper bond between the layers.
8.9.
Moisture Content for Compaction
The
moisture
content
at
compaction
shall not be less than
the optimum
moisture
content
corresponding
to
IS: 2720 (Part
VII) nor more than 2 per cent above it.
8.10.
Rolling
Immediately
after
spreading,
grading
and
levelling of the
mixed material, compaction shall be carried out with 8 to 10 tonne
smooth
wheel
rollers
or
other
approved
plant,
preceded by a
few passes of lighter rollers if necessary.
Rolling
shall commence
at
edges and
progress
towards
the
centre,
except at superelev-
ated
portions
where
it
shall commence
at
the
inner
edge and
progress towards outer. During rolling
the
surface
shall
be
fre-
quently
checked
for
grade
and
camber and
any
irregularities
corrected
by
loosening
the
material
and
removing
or
adding
fresh
material.
Compaction
shall
continue
until
the density
achieved
is
at
least
100 per cent of the maximum dry density for
the material determined in accordance with IS: 2720 (Part VII).

Care
shall
be
taken
to see that the compaction of lime sta-
bilised
material
is
completed
within
four hours of its mixing or
such shorter period as may be found necessary in dry
weather.
During
rolling,
it
shall be
ensured
that
compaction plant
does
not
bear
directly
on
hardened
or partially hardened trea-
ted
material
previously
laid
other
than
what may be necessary
for achieving the specified compaction at the joint.
The
final
surface
shall
be well closed, free from movement
under
compaction
plant,
compaction
planes,
ridges,
cracks
or
loose
material.
All
loose
or
segregated
or
otherwise defective
areas shall be made good to the
full
thickness
of the
layer
and
recompacted.
8.11.
Construction Joint
No
joints
except
construction
joints
shall be provided. At
the end of the day's work, a straight
tapering
transverse
constru-
ction
joint
for
full width
of
the course
shall be made by cham-
fering the edge of the already laid mix at
an
angle
of about
30°.
Before
resuming
work
at
any
construction
joint
left at the end
of previous work, the material at the joint
shall
be
scarified
and
moistened, blended
with new
mixture
and
compacted
to
form
a continuous section without a joint.
8.12.
Rectification of Surface Irregularities
The finished surface should be checked for line,
level,
grade
and
surface
finish.
Provisions, in Chapter 7 of IRC
: SP
:
1 1-1977
"Handbook
of quality
control
for
construction
of
road
and
runways (first revision)" should be followed for this purpose.
Any
area
involving
any
type
of undulation
or
waviness
should
be
removed
and
relaid
to
the
specification
and the surface should
be levelled.
8.13.
Curing and Sealing
Curing period, temperature and moisture maintained
during
the
process
of curing
period
are
important factors in the deve-

lopment
of
strength.
Field
curing
takes
place
over a range
of
optimum temperature though the range prescribed
for
laboratory
testing
is from
30°C to 38°C. Both extension of curing period and
increasing the curing temperature
result
in
increased
pozzolanic
reaction.
The
best
method
of
controlling
the
curing
moisture
content is to cover the lime-flyash-soil layer as soon as possible after
compaction with a bituminous
coating
as
a protection to prevent
drying. The bituminous material to be used for the purpose may be
a cut-back (MC-30) applied at 50°C to 60°C or an emulsion applied
at 25°C to 55°C at the rate of 8.3 kg per 10 sq m. Additional layers
such as base course are constructed, soon thereafter. When a bitu-
minous
cut-back
is
applied at a higher temperature,
it may cause
loss of moisture in the soil-lime mix. So
it is
desirable
if
a
slight
sprinkling of water
is made before applying the cut-back.
Curing
of the
compacted
layer can also be done, by sprea-
ding moist straw
or
sand
and
sprinkling
water
on
the
compa-
cted
surface.
In
that
case,
a minimum curing period of 28
days
is recommended before placing the next layer.
This may be
done
by sprinkling water 5 to 6 times a
day
ensuring
that
moisture
is
maintained
close
to OMC.
Until
curing is completed, no traffic
shall
be
allowed
on
the
stabilised
layer. Even no construction
equipment
of such
weight
which
can cause marring or rutting of
the
surface
shall
be
allowed
to
ply
on
the
layer. Only light,
essential
construction
equipment
may
be
allowed
to ply
till the
curing is completed.
8.14.
Arrangements
of Traffic
During
the
period
of construction
flow
of traffic
shall be
maintained
as
per
clause
105
of
Ministry of Shipping & Trans-
port Specification for Road and Bridge Works.

QUALITY CONTROL
For
the
satisfactory
performance
of
the
lime-flyash-soil
stabilised
road,
a
strict quality control
is very essential. For each
consignment
of lime and flyash, tests should be done to check the

purity.
In
the
case
of lime, Cao
content should be determined
and
it should not be less than 60 per cent.
In the same way, flyash
should have
required
fineness
i.e.
specific
surface
area
should
be 3200 cm 2/gm or 320 cm 2/kg.
With a view to ensuring adequate
strength
of
the
sub-base
or
base
course, density measurements
should be made at regular intervals. The compacted
layer
should
be cured for the stipulated
period.
The quality control
tests with
minimum desirable frequency should be as given in Appendix.
