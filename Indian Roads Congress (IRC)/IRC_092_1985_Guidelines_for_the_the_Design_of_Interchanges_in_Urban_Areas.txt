GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF INTERCHANGES
IN URBAN AREAS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Grade separation
is a form of intersection
in which one
or more conflicting movements of intersecting highways are
segre-
gated
in
space.
An
interchange
is
a
grade
separation
with
connecting
roadways
which
allow
route transfer
between
the
intersecting highways.
An interchange
is,
therefore,
the
highest
form of intersection
design.
It
should,
however,
be understood
that interchanges are essentially
intended
for
highways
carrying
predominantly fast moving motorised traffic
1.2.
The type of interchange, the shape and
pattern
of the
interchange ramps for the various
turning
movements,
and
their
design are governed by several factors
such as the importance
of
the intersecting
highways,
the
number of
intersecting
legs,
the
design volumes of through
and
turning traffic movements includ-
ing their composition,
the
design
speeds,
available
right-of-way
and topography.
Interchanges, therefore, are necessarily designed
individually in light of the above considerations.
This publication
gives guidelines for helping the designer in developing appropriate
designs for interchanges under different situations in urban areas.
1.3.
Interchanges are costly and
a
treatment
of
this
type
cannot be justified unless the benefits likely to accrue to
the
com-
munity are so high as to exceed the high cost associated
with such
improvements.
1.4.
The Traffic Engineering Committee at its meeting
held
in October, 1977 while considering a draft on the subject prepared
by Shri A.K.
Bandopadhyaya,
set up a Subcommittee
to
finalise
the document.
On the
authorisation
of
this
Subcommittee,
the
draft
was
finalised
jointly
by
S/Shri
A.K.
Bhattacharya
and
D. Sanyal.
This document was considered by
the
Traffic
Engi-
neering Committee at
its meeting held in
September,
1982
when
it
decided
that
the
document
may
be
revised
by
Shri
K.
Arunachalam
in
light
of
the
comments
received
from
the
various
members.
The
document
as
revised
by
Shri
K.
Arunachalam
was
approved
by
the
Traffic
Engineering Com-

DEFINITIONS
2.1.
Grade Separation
A grade separation
is a crossing of two or more
highways, a
highway and a rail road,
or
a
highway
and
any
other
type
of
facility such as a pedestrain walk way or a bicycle way.
2.2.
Ramp
An
inter-connecting
roadway
or
any
connection
between
highways at
different
levels,
or
between
parallel
highways,
on
which vehicles may enter
or
leave
a
designated
roadway.
The
components of a ramp are a terminal at each end and
a
connect-
ing road, usually with some curvature and on a grade.
2.3.
Interchange
An interchange
is a grade
separated
intersection
with
con-
necting roadways
(ramps)
for
turning
traffic
between
highway
approaches.
3. WARRANTS FOR INTERCHANGE
3.1.
Interchanges, in
general,
are
expensive
to
construct
and a major factor influencing the cost
is the type of
arrangement
made for the various traffic
movements.
The
arrangement
may
range from separating only one traffic movement from other to the
complete separation of each
traffic
movement
from
every
other
movement so that only merging and diverging movements remain.
Similarly, the vehicle operating cost will
vary
depending
on
the
type of ramp arrangement, from
direct
conflict— free
connections
to indirect connections involving extra travel distance.
As
inter-
changes are custom designed to suit
the
prevailing
conditions,
it
will
be
necessary
to
carry
out
cost-benefit
study
taking
into
account the total transportation cost,
i.e. the cost
of
construction,
maintenance
and
vehicle
operation,
to
evaluate
the
techno-
economic merits of the individual cases before
a
final
decision
is
taken.
However, the
following
points may be helpful in guiding
the choice of
an
interchange
at the preliminary planning stage:
(i) Interchange will be necessary at al\ crossings of
a highway
which
is
to be developed to completely access controlled standard.
Similarly,
interchanges will also be required
at all major crossings on highways
developed to expressway standard.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 28
======================================================================
[RC: 92-1985
(ii) An interchange may be
justified at the crossing of a
major
arterial
road with another road of similar category carrying heavy traffic.
(iii) An interchange may be
justified when an at grade inter-section fails
to handle the volume
of
traffic
resulting
in serious congestion and
frequent
choking
of
the
inter-section
This
situation may
arise
when the total traffic of all the arms of the intersection
is
in
excess
of 10,000 pcu's per hour.
(iv) High and disproportionate rate of fatal and
major
accidents
at
an
intersection not found to respond to other traffic control or improve-
ment measures may warrant an interchange.
(v) In some situations, the
topography
is such that interchanges are the
only type that can be constructed economically.
4.
TYPE OF INTERCHANGES
4.1.
Interchanges are generally described by the pattern
of
the various
turning
roadways
or
ramps
which
determine
their
geometric
configuration.
The ramps
can
be
broadly
classified
into the following four basic types, also illustrated
in, Fig.

Different types of ramps
(i)
Left turning roadway referred to as diagonal ramp or outer
connec-
tion depending on
its shape or type of interchange.
(ii) A loop which
is a ramp
for
right
turns accomplished by a left exit
and turn to the left through about 270*.

======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 92-1985
(iii)
Semi-direct connection which is a ramp for right
turns accomplished
through a
partial deviation from the intended path.
(iv)
Direct connection which
is a ramp
for
right turns accomplished by
a right directional and natural manoeuvre involving least extra
travel
distance.
4.2.
The common
geometric configurations of interchanges
are the trumpet,
diamond,
cloverleaf, rotary and directional, see
Figs.
1
and 2 for
typical examples.
Within each type of interch-
ange, there can be several variations such as
split diamond, partial
cloverleaf, etc. depending on the ramp
arrangements.
The broad
operational
characteristics
of each
of the
common
interchange
types are brought out in paras 4.3. to 4.7.
4.3.
Trumpet Interchange
Fig.
1, shows
a
typical
3-leg
interchange which takes the
shape of trumpet.
This is the simplest interchange form adaptable
to
lT
9 or 'V
intersections.
Of the
two right turning movements,
one
is
negotiated
by a
loop
while the
other
is by a semi-direct
connection.
Diagonal ramps are provided
for left
turning move-
ments.
There can be several variations of the design depending on
the type of connection provided.
The type of connection provided
for the right turning movements should be based on traffic volumes.
The ramps
catering
for
heavy
traffic
volumes should preferably
be provided with direct connections.
Fig.
1, illustrates the replace-
ment of a loop ramp by a direct connection.
4.4.
Diamond Interchange
4.4.1.
Fig.
2(a)
shows
a
typical
diamond
interchange.
Diamond
interchange
is the simplest of 4-leg interchange designs
and
is
particularly
adaptable
for major-minor
highway intersec-
tions.
The
ramps
which
provide
for
one way
movement are
usually elongated along
the
major highway and may be curved or
parallel to the major
highway.
The ramp terminals on the minor
road are at-grade intersections providing
for right and
left turning
movements.
These
at-grade
intersections may
be
controlled by
signals if warranted
by
traffic
volumes or in the absence of
ade-
quate sight distance.
4.4.2.
The diamond design requires minimum land, involves
only a small extra travel distance
for right
turning
traffic,
is
the
least
costly,
and will be found
ideal for most of
the cases both in
urban and rural areas.
However, this type of interchange
has
the
demerit of limited capacity because of the at-grade terminals on the
minor road.
The situation can be improved by v/idening
the cross

road through the interchange area, or the ramp terminals, or
both.
Further
improvements can be effected
by having a split diamond
or 3-level diamond, but this will involve more than one bridge.
4.5.
Cloverleaf Interchange
4.5.1.
Fig. 2 (b), shows a typical cloverleaf interchange. The
design consists of
one loop ramp for
right turning traffic
and one
outer connection for left turning traffic in each
quadrant. Vehicles
desiring
to
turn
right
are
required to turn left through about 270
degrees before attaining the desired direction.
4.5.2.
This
type
of
interchange
provides
for continuous
movement to all
interchanging
traffic
and
is particularly suitable
for the
crossing
of two major roads of equal
importance in rural
areas.
In urban areas, this type of interchange tends to use up too
much of costly urban space.
4.5.3.
Cloverleaf
design
involves
appreciable
extra travel
distance
for the
right
moving
traffic and requires a large space.
Though all crossing movement conflicts
are
eliminated, a weaving
section is created between the exit and entry points near
the
struc-
ture along each direction of travel on the intersecting roads. These
weaving sections constitute a
critical
element
in the
design, and
unless these
are designed
to have
adequate length and capacity,
there may be serious loss in capacity besides increased hazards.
4.5.4.
In cases where at-grade
crossing on one of the roads
can be tolerated, full cloverleaf development will
not be required.
For such cases, partial cloverleaf which
is a modification that com-
bines some
elements
of a
diamond interchange with one or more
loops to eliminate only
the more
critical conflicts can be adopted.
A number of variations are
possible for
meeting
the
different site
conditions and traffic
distribution.
Fig. 2 (c),
depicts one design
of partial cloverleaf.
4.6.
Rotary Interchange
4.6.1.
This
type
of
design
is
particularly
useful where a
number of roads intersect at the interchange and in locations where
sufficient
land
is
available.
It requires
the
construction of two
bridges and
generally
necessitates more land than for a diamond
layout.
The main highway goes over or under the rotary intersec-
tion and turning
movements
are
accommodated by the diagonal
ramps.
Fig. 2 (d), shows a typical rotary interchange.
4.6.2.
The capacity of a rotary interchange
is
similar to that
7

of at-grade rotary.
High speed
operations
cannot be maintained
on the minor road because of the usually
short weaving
distances.
It can, however, operate satisfactorily at low speeds.
Also this type
of design entails only a
little additional
travel
distance
for
inter-
changing traffic
which
is a
specific advantage when slow moving
traffic is present.
4.7.
Directional Interchange
Directional interchanges have ramps for
right
turning traffic
which
follow the natural
direction
of
movement.
This
type of
design
requires
more
than one
structure, or a 3-level structure.
Though
operationally
more efficient
than
other
designs,
these
generally turn out to be very expensive.
5.
GEOMETRIC DESIGN STANDARDS FOR INTERCHANGE
ELEMENTS
5.1.
Ramps
5.1.1.
Design speed, horizontal curvature and sight
distance:
Design speed of a ramp should be related to
the
design
speed
of
the
major intersecting highway.
Ramp design speeds corrtspond-
ing to the highway design speeds
of
80 and
100 km/h
are given
in Table
1.
Design speeds
of 80 km/h
are
applicable
to
inter-
changes on urban highways.
Minimum
radius
of
horizontal
curve
and
sight
distance
corresponding
to
the design speeds
are also indicated in Table
1.
The
sight
distance
values
are
for
safe
stopping conditions and
should be ensured both in the
horizontal
and
vertical
directions.
The
sight
distance
should
be measured between two points, one
at a height of 1.2 m above the road level representing the
driver's
eye
and
the
other
0.15 m
above
the
road
level
denoting the
object.
Horizontal
curvature
of ramps
should
preferably
be
of
circular
curve
with
transitions
at
either
ends. Where this is not
feasible, 2-centred compound curves may
be
employed
provided
that
the
radius
of any
curve is not less than one-half the radius
of the preceding curve.
5.1.2.
Grade
and
profile
: Ramp
profiles
usually
consist
of a section of tangent grade between two
vertical
curves,
valley
curve
at
the
lower end and summit curve at the upper end. The
tangent
grades on ramps
should be
as
flat as feasible, and desi-
rably,
it

The
vertical
curves
at either
ends
of the ramp should be
designed
to
provide
for
atleast
the
safe stopping sight distance
corresponding
to
the

the
ramp. The length of
vertical
curves
for

speeds of 30 to 100 km/h are
given in
Table 2.

Cross-section
: The
ramp may
be
for
one-way or
two-way operation. If for two-way,
divided
type
of
cross-section
should be used with a minimum width of 1.2 m for the median.

be
helpful in choosing the appropriate pavement width. The minimum
width
of shoulders
should
be
2 m
of which at least one metre
should be paved. The
shoulders
should
be
properly
delineated
by means of pavement markings (see IRC:

5.2.
Ramp Terminals
5.2.1.
General:
Ramp
terminal
is
that
portion
adjacent
to the through travelled way including speed change
lanes,
tapers
and
islands.
Free-flow
type
ramp terminals where ramps
traffic
merges with (entrance terminal) or
diverges
from
(exit terminal)
high speed through highway at flat angles should invariably be pro-
vided with speed change lanes i.e. acceleration lane at entrance ter-
minal and deceleration lane at
exit
terminal.
The
speed change
lanes should be
carefully
sited to ensure that they are not
hidden
from the
view
of approaching
traffic
by
horizontal
or
vertical
curves.
5.2.2.
Entrance
terminal
:
The
entrance
terminal
should
provide for sufficient length of acceleration lane to enable a driver
to increase
his
speed from that on the turning ramp road-way to
that
of
the
operation
speed
of the highway
as also to provide
manoeuvring space so that the driver can watch and
take
advan-
tage
of an
opening
in the adjacent stream of through traffic and
10

move laterally into
it. At
the end of
the
acceleration
lane,
it
is
important
that
there
should
be
no
kerb
or
other obstruction
which might be dangerous for a driver unable to
merge
with
the
traffic stream on the near side lane within the length of the accele-
ration lane.
Acceleration
lanes
are
designed
in
two
general
forms,
namely,
the
direct
taper
type
and
the parallel type. The taper
type
works
on
the
principle
of
direct entry at a flat angle and
part
of
the
lane
is
separated from
the through pavement of the
highway. Though this form
is generally preferred by the
vehicles,
it
requires
more
space
with
the
turning
curve
located
farther
away
from
the
edge
of the main highway. The parallel type has
an
additional
lane
built
on
the highway itself for speed change
purposes. Both types will
operate
satisfactorily
if designed
pro-
perly, though the direct taper
type will
be
appropriate
for
most
cases.
The length of acceleration lane
is governed by the
difference
between
the
running
speeds
of the entrance curve of the ramp
and
of the
highway.
The minimum
and
desirable
lengths
of
acceleration lane are given in Table 3. These lengths are particularly
influenced
by
gradient.
On down
gradient, the
length given in
Table
3
may
be
reduced
to (1-0.08G) times and on up gradient
increased to
(I -f 0.12G) times, where G
is
the
gradient expressed
as a percentage.

5.2.3.
Exit
terminal
:
The
exit
terminal should be provi-
ded with sufficient length of
deceleration
lane
to
enable
vehicles
leaving the highway at high speeds to reduce their speeds
to
nego-
tiate the turning curve on the
exit
ramp.
Similar
to
acceleration
lane, deceleration
lane
can
be
of two forms, namely, direct taper
type and
parallel
type.
Recommended minimum
and desirable
lengths of deceleration lane are also indicated in Table 3. Where the
11



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 92-1985
lanes are in up gradient, their length may be reduced to (1— 0.03G)
times and
while
on
down gradient increased to (1 + 0.06G) times
the
values given in the Table
3, where G
is the gradient expressed
as a percentage.
Typical designs for exit
terminal
provided with deceleration
lane
are
also shown
in
Fig.
3.
It may
be noted that the nose
separating
the
through
lane from the turning lane is off-set from
the
edge
of the
through lane by 2 m to enable an errant vehicle
which
has
inadvertently
left
the
through
lane
to
return
with
minimum disruption to
through
traffic.
It
is also important
that
the "Core" area formed by the edges of the through and the
turn-
ing
lanes
immediately
beyond
the point of divergence should be
kept
free
of
all
hazardous
obstructions
so as to provide a clear
recovery area for out of control vehicles.
5.3.
Weaving Sections
Weaving manoeuvres take place at interchanges where succes-
sive entry and exit terminals
are
located
near to each other as
in
a cloverleaf design.
The capacity of the
weaving
sections
which
depends
on
the
length,
the number
of weaving
lanes
and the
proportion
of weaving
traffic should be adequate enough for per-
forming the weaving manoeuvre without appreciable loss in speed.
The
recommended
desirable and
minimum
lengths
of weaving
sections are 300 m and 200 m respectively.
5.4.
Clearance
5.4.1.
Lateral
clearance
:
For
underpass
roadways, desir-
ably
the
full
roadway
width at the approaches should be carried
through
the
underpass.
This
implies
that
the minimum lateral
clearance
(i.e. the distance between the extreme edge of
the
carri-
ageway
and
the
face of nearest support, whether solid abutment
pier or column) should equal the normal shoulder width. For more
details on
clearances,
reference may be made to IRC
:
54-1974
"Lateral
and
Vertical
Clearance
at
Underpasses
for Vehicular
Traffic".
For
overpass
structures,
the
clearances are not that critical
as in the case of underpasses since the drivers do not generally
get
the
feeling
of
constriction.
A
cross-section
with
225 mm wide
kerb
and
open-type
parapet
will
generally
be suitable for most
cases.
5.4.2.
Vertical clearance
:
Vertical clearance
at underpass
should
be minimum 5.5 m in urban areas, after making allowance
for any future raising/strengthening of the underpass roadway.

DESIGN OF INTERCHANGES
6.1
.
Selection of Interchange Type
6.1.1.
Selection
of the most appropriate type of interchange
for
the
prevailing
conditions is an important step in design.
The
specific form
or
type
of interchange will depend on the physical
conditions
of the
site such as topography, available right-of-way,
land-use
and
developments
alongside
the
intersecting
roads,
expected
volumes
of through
and
turning traffic including their
composition, orientation of the intersecting highways, etc.
6.1.2.
At
an interchange, not all the traffic streams need be
grade
separated
in most of the cases.
A study of the design peak
hour
traffic
on
all
the arms
and the directional distribution will
clearly
bring
out
the
major conflict points and the traffic streams
which
should
be
grade
separated to provide for free flow condi-
tions and satisfy the capacity requirements.
For design traffic pro-
jection,
a
horizon
of 20
years may be adopted.
For directional
distribution of traffic in the design year, unless the factors expected
to
change
the
pattern are known, a distribution similar to the one
derived
from
the
current traffic surveys may be adopted.
From
the
traffic
data,
design
peak
hour traffic flow diagram should be
prepared,
a
sample
of which
is
shown
in,
Fig. 4 (a).
Once a
particular
type
of interchange
is chosen for preliminary design, a
traffic
distribution diagram should be prepared for
facilitating the
design
of
the
individual
components.
A
diagram
for a
typical
diamond
interchange
is shown in, Fig. 4 (b) for illustration.
For
simplicity,
this
diagram
shows
only
the
fast
traffic
in
terms of
pcu's.
Similar diagram should
be
prepared
for
slow
traffic
for
checking the adequacy of design.
For converting fast vehicles into
pcu's, the following equivalency factors may be adopted
:

6.1.3.
Study of the physical conditions
of the site should in-
clude:
(i) The topography— this will
bring out the roadway that can be made
to flyover
or
run in a subway as also the pattern and possible locat-
ion of the ramps for maximum economy.
(ii) Location,
alignment
and
design
features
of
the
intersecting
highways— this will help to identify or distinguish the major highway

PAGE 22 of 28

IRC

where free flow type ramp terminals may be
necessary.
On
a high-
way with frequent at-grade
intersections, the ramp terminals should
also be at-grade.
Similarly,
terminals on highways carrying more
than
10
per cent slow traffic (i.e. carts, bicycles, etc.) should be at-
grade.
(iii) Roadside developments— the
design should be conducive to provide
access to roadside properties and connection to existing access roads.
This may call for construction
of frontage road
or
collector
roads
with connection to the highway at appropriate points.
(iv)
Practicability of maintaining traffic during construction— this is
im-
protant
where the
intersecting roads are existing roads.
When the
fly-over structure
is under construction,
it should be
possible to pro-
vide for at-grade connections to all
traffic movements.
(v)
Flexibility for future adjustment and stage development— this should
include a study of
the
design
vis-a-vis the planned developments in
the
adjoining
area,
augmentation
of
services and other improve-
ments.
6.1.4.
Based
on
a
study of the traffic data (para 6.1.2.) in
conjunction with the considerations
given
in para
6.1.3. and
the
operational characteristics of the
different
types
of
interchanges
explained in para 4, study sketches for
a number
of
interchange
designs which are suitable to meet the traffic needs and are
practi-
cable for the site conditions should be prepared.
These should be
examined and short listed for preparing preliminary plan and pro-
file.
While doing so, the
following
principles
should
be kept in
view:
(i) Adoptability and attainability in the particular situation.
(ii) Impact on access to
adjoining properties because of
the provision of the interchange.
(iii)
Relative operational features and capacity potentials.
(iv)
Flexibility for future adjustment and expansion.
The design selected at this stage should be
further evaluated
for
initial
construction
cost and cost of vehicle operation, and the
best among the alternatives selected for final design.
6.2.
Decision as to which Road should Fly-over
6.2.1.
The
following
factors
should
be kept in view while
deciding on the road to fly-over the other road:
(i) A design that best
fits the existing topography will be the most plea-
sing and
economical
to
construct
and
maintain, and this becomes
the first consideration
in the choice of the road to be elevated.
(ii) Where turning traffic
is significant, the ramp profiles are best fitted
when the major road
is
at the
lower level.
The ramp grades assist
turning vehicles to decelerate as they leave the major highway and to
accelerate as they approach
it.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 92-1985
(iii) As far as possible,
the gradeline of the major highway should not
be
unduly disturbed.
Where
the widths of the roads are greatly
different,
the
quantity of earthwork
for
the
approaches makes
this arrangement more economical.
(iv) Troublesome drainage
problems may be
sufficient reason
in some
cases for choosing to carry the major highway over the minor road.
(v) Where new highway
crosses
an
existing
route
carrying
a
large
volume of traffic, over-crossing by the new highway
will
cause
the
least disturbance to the existing route.
6.3.
Location of Ramp Terminals
6.3.1.
The
ramp
terminals
should
be
located
sufficiently
away from the grade separation structure
so that vehicles entering
or leaving
the
highway
have sufficient
visibility distance for per-
forming the turning manoeuvres with safety.
6.3.2.
At-grade ramp terminals, as on the minor road in the
case of diamond design,
should
be
located at a distance equal to
atleast the safe stopping sight distance corresponding to the design
speed of that road.
6.3.3.
As regards the free flow type ramp terminals, the dis-
tance between the structure and the nose of the
exit
terminal
on
the far side of the structure should at least be 75 m
for exit drivers
to have
a
good
view
of
the
terminals
and
leave
the
through
lanes without undue
hindrance to the
through traffic.
The corr-
esponding
distance
for
far
side entrance terminals should be at-
least 150 m to enable entrance drivers in having a clear view
well
back on the
through
road
ahead or to their right.
However, for
terminals on the near side of the structure, this separation distance
is not critical for entrance drivers since their view back along
the
highway is not affected by the structure.
Such terminals could be
located
at
a
distance
equal
to the acceleration lane, and
where
this is not possible, at a distance of at least 15 m with the accelera-
tion lane continuing through or over the structure.
6.4.
Lane Balance
The basic number of lanes should be uniform for
a
substan-
tial length of the highway.
The basic number of lanes to be
used
on the highway and the minmum
number
of
lanes
required for
ramps are determined by a capacity
analysis
of
the
design traffic
volumes.
To realise efficient traffic operation through and beyond
the
interchange, there
should
be
a
balance
in number of traffic
lanes required
on
the
highway
and on the ramps.
If additional
traffic lanes are needed on the highway
to
maintain
lane
balance
with the ramp,
it
should
be
accomplished
by
adding
auxiliary
17



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 28
======================================================================
IRC
: 92-1985
lanes rather than changing basic number of lanes.
Lane
balance
should be checked on the basis of the following
principles:
(i) The number
of lanes beyond merging of two traffic streams should
not be less than the sum of all traffic lanes on the merging minus one.
(ii) In conjunction with the two-lane entrance, the highway
beyond
the
ramp entrance should be
at
least
one
lane
wider than the highway
approaching the entrance.
(iii)
In
conjunction
with
two-lane
exit,
the number
of
lanes
on
the
highway
should
be reduced by one lane downstream from the ramp
exit.
(iv) Highway carriageway should be reduced by rot more than one traffic
lane at a time.
(v) For cloverleaf designs where an exit ramp closely follows an entrance
ramp,
it
will
be
preferable
to combine
the speed-change lanes of
these terminals into a full-width auxiliary lane.
6.5.
Provisions for Slow
Traffic
6.5.1.
Interchanges
are
essentially
intended
for highways
carrying fast moving traffic.
Slow
moving
traffic
like
carts and
bicycles
if
present
in
appreciable
numbers
will
cause
serious
obstruction to the free operation, particularly at the free-flow type
ramp terminals.
For example, the purpose
of long
acceleration
lane will be completely lost even if one
slow
vehicle comes in the
way
of
fast
vehicles
at
the
ramp
terminal.
Another
major
problem
is the tendency on the part of the
slow
vehicles
in
not
us ing detours in the form of
indirect
connections
like
loops
and
in finding shorter routes by cutting across the medians or in moving
in
the wrong
direction,
all
leading
to confusion and hazardous
situation.
Where
slow
traffic
present
in
any
of the intersecting
highways
is more
than
about
10
per cent, the classical forms of
interchange
designs
will
require
modifications,
particularly
in
respect of the
following:
(i) Designs involving loops should be avoided as far as possible. Rotary
or diamond
type interchange
with
parallel
ramps
will
be more
appropriate.
(ii) The acceleration and deceleration lanes will serve more for providing
manoeuvring
space than for their intended
purpose.
Their lengths
recommended
in
para
4 could therefore be reduced by 25 per cent
without much loss in
efficiency.
(iii)
Irrespective
of
traffic
volume,
it
will
be
preferable
to
have
a
carriageway width
of at least
5.5 m for the ramps so as to facilitate
easy
overtaking
of
the slow traffic by the faster ones.
(iv) As
it is desirable to ban the movement of slow traffic on the elevated
major road, the slow
traffic can be permitted on the roads on either
side
of the
bridge
and across the minor road at appropriate places
with signal control as shown in, Fig.

A
typical
design
for
an
interchange
in urban area
having provisions for slow traffic is illustrated
in, Fig.

Signing of
Interchanges
6.6.1.
The
signs
on
the
interchanges
should
serve
the
following
functions
:
(i) These
should
furnish
advance
notice of
the
approach
to
the
interchange.
(ii) These should direct drivers into
appropriate lanes
well
in advance
of diverging or merging movements.
(iii) These should identify routes and directions on
these routes.
(iv) These should show distances to destinations.
(v) These should provide other information of importance to the
driver.
6.6.2.
The
size
and
lettering
of interchange
signs
should
correspond
to
the
type
of highway
on
which the interchange is
situated.
However, the letters,
numerals,
symbols
and
borders
should be reflectorised for
better
visibility.
6.6.3. The signing plan showing the type and location
of
the
different signs should be prepared simultaneously with
the
design
of the interchange.
6.7.
Landscape Development
6.7.1.
An
interchange
in
an
urban area is an integral part
of the city strucuture and
aesthetically
it must be treated as such.
The retaining walls and
all other large and exposed concrete
mass
should
be
suitably
softened.
Perspective
drawings,
including
scale
models
must
be
prepared
so
that
best arrangements
for
landscaping
could
be developed.
6.7.2.

information
on
landscaping of highways,

Publication

on Landscaping of Roads'.
